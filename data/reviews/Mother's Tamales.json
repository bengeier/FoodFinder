{"text":"Flavorful tamales! Soft and moist, no need for any salsa or sauce. The chicken has a slight spicy heat as it has green chilies in it. Perfect balance of meat filling to masa. The pork tamales were very good too, but not spicy.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time. I got tamales to go from the drive through window. They were large and at 6 / $10 a good value. Most other places charge the same price for skinny little ones but these were nice and big. The beef is very tasty. The pineapple had raisins in it and not enough pineapple for my taste. Service was super friendly even though we were there at 9 pm. 

We will definitely be back and will try the rest of the menu. I am looking forward to trying the carne asada. If it is anywhere as good as the beef tamales then it will be epic."}
{"text":"We had three tamales each, one beef, one pork and one chicken.  All three were great.  The salsa was to die for.  It is a green salsa with green onion chunks in it.  Spicey but not to hot.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time we have been here. They have gained life long customers. We got the green chili chicken and red beef tamales. Omg they are amazing! The rice and beans were so good too. And the price can't be beat either. Make sure you order in advance! Don't walk in expecting to pick up an order right then. Phenomenol!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My dad discovered it about 2 months ago and we've been hooked ever since. We've tried the menudo, pozole, green chili burrito, and tamales and we are impressed with how good and flavorful it all is. On top of the delicious food the workers are amazing! Great service. Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Stopped in Later in the evening. I took a little bit to get served and get my food the food was decent. This salsa was OK nothing special . I know some I got there I was a little older they'll be cleaned up just a little bit. I guess the downside was it took me about 25 minutes to get my food and I wasn't only but three other people there. I may try to get them just check it out."}
{"text":"Upon reviews I came here for the Pozole, horrible very greasy save your $$$ don't bother and it had more nerves than meat. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow. The menudo was fantastic. I got a small bowl that certainly seemed very large. The tamales were soooo good. Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Tamales are delicious. I recommend the pork ones. Chips and salsa are made fresh. So good! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is legit! So far I have only had the Green chili burrito, and the Posole. They are both awesome. The green chili has a really nice flavor, and it has potatoes, and is very good. I find myself craving them. The ladies running the place are nice, service is very good. It is not a place to go for atmosphere or date night, but the price is right, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Only had the chance to have the pork and chicken tamales so far, both were delicious! They were big and full of flavor. Can't wait to try the others, and the house salsa which I forgot to sample. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Went to mother's tamales had a chicken tamale it was bomb had their fluatas it was bomb had their beef soup now we're talking delicious can't say nothing but good about this place every thing on their menu I gave a 5 star check it you'll enjoy it an go back"}
{"text":"Best place for tamales for sure, they're surprisingly soft and flavorful and have the an appropriate masa to stuffing ratio. They also make a spectacular carne asada burrito and the salsa is deliciously spicy."}
{"text":"Can't tell you how the food is, because we never even made it through the ordering process. Tried to place a phone order for work. When the conversation first started we were told it would be no problem to call ahead, but it quickly fell apart from there. Long story short, the lady that answered actually said, while covering the phone, \"I don't know how to do a phone order.\" After struggling though trying to figure out how to place the order, we were then told that they hadn't made any tamales for the day... Your business literally has \"Tamales\" in the name... How do you not have any tamales?! So disappointed. Even had the Valentina's out and ready..."}
{"text":"Me and my wife, try this place out, we didn't have high hopes because we are picky about eating Mexican food at a restaurant only because we were raised on Mexican food. 
To my surprise the food was really GOOD, the food tasted fresh and homemade! I had their chorizo breakfast burrito, my wife had  menudo and we shared a couple of tamales. All of it tasted GREAT, prices are fair, place smells and looks clean. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is great, salsa are excellent! Our family had the pozole, tamales and huevos rancheros   it was yummy"}
{"text":"This last time we bought food over there my husband got Salmonella with the chicken tamales, really disappointing because we love the tamales over there."}
{"text":"GRAND OPENING! Opened Dec 2016.
Went and ate here 2x so far.
Love it!
Great authentic fresh food.
Clean food and clean restaurant!
Great prices and great service.
So far I have had the beef soup, (caldo de res), Carne asada tacos and sweet corn and beef tamales. All of it was wonderful. Fresh and flavorful. Nice presentation too.
My hubby had the pork tamale and Menudo soup. He loved it and he is Mexican, so he knows good Mexican food.
Love this place.
They have a drive thru and about 8 tables inside. 
Crossstreets are Gilbert and Broadway
They will be offering aqua fresca and a few new items to the menu in the next month.
Posole, menudo caldo de res, soups on weekends only."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and I'm disappointed I missed out for so long! I had a chorizo burrito for breakfast and it was delicious. As odd as the complaint may be, I find that most other restaurants put way too much chorizo and not enough other ingredients in their burritos, but this one was more balanced. I wish I could've tried the tamales but they weren't ready so early in the morning. I guess most people don't eat tamales for breakfast but I'm weird like that, I wanted to try them while I was there. oh well, I may just have to go back for lunch! They only have 1 kind of salsa but it is SO delicious, much better than anything you'll get at any 'bertos. Oh and the staff is lovely as well, that's always a plus."}
{"text":"The place is small to say the least.  I ordered the Menudo it was a good amount for a small bowl.  Very good flavor however too salty for my taste. 

There is plenty of parking and they run out of caldo de Rez and tamales quickly and their menu is limited."}
{"text":"Tried the carne asada burrito & green chile burrito they were so delicious. Went through drive thru took awhile but worth it  nice & hot & good salsa."}
{"text":"OMG,  giant tamales! !  The flavor of the corn jalapeños, and cheese are to die for.  Chicken tamales are wonderful as well.  I have never tasted menudo as good as mother's.   I strongly strongly recommend  you tell your friends and family about this jewel.  You won't be disappointed. !!!!"}
{"text":"I live close to here and always drive by and have been wanting to check it out. After reading such great reviews I though my what the heck. 

I called before to see if they had tamales ready. First off, the lady who answered the phone (Merna) was not only sweet but very helpful. I went through the drive through and met her and she was so nice!

I got 6 beef and 6 chicken enchiladas to bring to my  family. The beef enchiladas were a little bland and the masa was a little firm but they were still quite good. 

The chicken ones though? Wow! The chicken was very tender and the green sauce with it was phenomenal. My parents typically don't like chicken tamales but even they really liked them. My brother liked both of them but preferred the chicken. 

I will definitely go back. Great service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Great tamales and huge burritos.  We got there at 5:30 and they only had green chili chicken and jalapeño cheese tamales left so that's what we got, along with a green chili beef burrito. We took a tamale and half a burrito home. Can't wait to go back and try the sweet corn tamales."}
{"text":"THE BEST EVER Tamales! EVER! A must! We live in Prescott, but travel to Mesa. Why? Because they have THE BEST Tamales EVER! Try it, you'll LOVE it, too!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast around 10:15. Waited about 30 mins for 2 bean and cheese burritos and 1 chorizo burrito. There was one other family of four in the lobby. The food was pretty good, but not worth the wait. When it takes that long, they need to at least apologize for the wait or throw a drink or something your way while you sit there. Food was good, but missed the mark on basic customer service. Really friendly ladies though."}
{"text":"The food was really good however; tried returning a couple of time on a Sunday and they did not have the tamales on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! We will be back soon. Menudo to die for & tamales are heavenly. I felt at home for sure."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall, but the food is great. I've never had anything I didn't like here. Good, authentic, quality Mexican food. I took one star away because they don't always have ever type of tamale available ."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Had some menudo and walked out with a dozen tamales. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"Sunday later dinner afterthought.. went in craving menudo and pozole.. they were out... peaked the craving
Ordered the carne asada burrito and soup de rez.. the burrito was really good. They added beans and cheese and pico of.some kind.. the beans were home made.. mother enjoyed the soup.. it is not my thing. Will re post after we try menudo and pozole"}
{"text":"ok, the menu isnt complex and if you are white they wonder if you are in the right place as the clientele seems to be mostly hispanic. The tamales were very tasty. I loved the green chili one. Horchata was good. The place was clean and the staff really friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible tamales. I tried when it had just opened and as the sign says tamales so I tried it really really regret it. Was not made with the actual tamales Masa the Mexican way instead is made from the bag you buy at the grocery store mazeca. Just awful wouldn't dare to try anything else."}
{"text":"If you want home an authentic Mexican food this is the place very simple menu what they offer they do it and they do it well first time but will not be the last I arrived around 7:30 in the morning could tell my server/cook was just just not to long getting started for the day was hoping still I could get tamales since that's their main specialty but it would be about an half&hour wait so decided to go with the green Chile burrito it was so good as well as the salsa it came with it had a little kick which I like &the burro was way more big then I expected I will make note we did have a language barrier so we had to go to our iPhone to Translate  but over great food& service"}
{"text":"I went in to try the tamales and they are delicious. I tried chicken and I loved them, so tasty and they are a very good size portion. You can fill up with two. I ordered a dozen tamales to go. They have beef, chicken, pork. They also sell other foods but I only got tamales . Great service. Small place, great food. I will definitely be going back for more tamales and to try out the other foods. It's a 100% mother's cooking."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 dz tamales - mix of beef, pork, chicken and corn for the extended family to share. 

Crunched for time the day I needed them, I was offered just impeccable customer service. Delivery early in the morning (8am) with piping hot fresh corn-husked little gifts. The overwhelming winner is CHICKEN. Normally chicken is so dry and bland but this was perfection. Beef came in second. Size of tamales so fair for price. 

Great experience. Will be back!

Side note: Corn was not to my taste but fresh none the less. I was surprised how sweet it turned out. Dessert-level sweetness to me."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday at noon for lunch. I thought I'd clear out one of my bookmarks and this place is just down the street. Not hard to find, it's right on the corner of 2 major streets, the building looks like it may have been a Taco Bell at one time. The place is small with about 10 tables inside and a drive through window. There isn't a lot of variety on the menu. They feature several tamales and combo-meals. They have a variety of breakfast burritos and a few different soups. 

When I arrived the Mariachi music was blaring a little too loud. Another customer requested that the music be turned down a notch. The woman at the counter was very helpful explaining the menu items I was unfamiliar with. I ordered a pork tamale and a small bowl of menudo. My tamale was out first. It was good, but nothing to rave about. The tamale was warm not hot, and a little on the bland side. Some hot sauce did the trick. The pork was cooked right and was tender. The masa was soft not rubbery. The menudo came out piping hot with a side of corn tortillas and onions and cilantro for a garnish. The soup had a nice flavor but was too greasy. I could feel my cholesterol jump 30 points. I've had menudo that didn't have an oil slick floating on top. 

I won't give up on this place just yet. Next time I'll try the pozole or maybe a combo plate. Today's meal was just average, but the price was very reasonable. Looking forward to another go."}
{"text":"Had green chili pork burritos. Absolutely delicious! Not too spicy for kids but with just enough heat to make them interesting. Exterior of the burritos were lightly toasted on the grill which to my mind made them perfect. Tried the chicken and beef tamales which were moist and delicious. We will definitely be back and work our way through the entire menu."}
