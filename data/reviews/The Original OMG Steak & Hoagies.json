{"text":"I've been watching this place for a while now and was waiting for the opportunity to give it a try.  Although they specialize in cheese steak sandwiches I went out on a limb and got the Italian hoagie as I was craving some Italian deli that day.  When my order arrived immediately I noticed the size of the sandwich.  Its was huge.  Although there was no cooking involved so I cant really rate that.  The bread was super fresh and the meat to bread ratio was perfect.  The sauce they put on the sandwich was almost like a sub sauce but with a twist.  It went perfect with the meat combination.  The french fries seemed to be fresh cut.  Great fries.  I will be visiting OMG again real soon and will be trying their cheese steak sandwich."}

{"text":"Walked in, it looked the same as it was the last time I was there under another business name, same colors too. Dine in seating was available although the restaurant was filled with more people who were not eating (family I guess?) than patrons during my stay. We were the only ones in a busy restaurant eating while everyone watched on.  When ordering, I advised it was my first time and the lady behind the counter took a few moments to explain the menu. Within a few seconds of that, the gentleman in the kitchen (I assume he was the owner) also asked it it was our first time and came out to explain the menu in greater detail.  He also explained the bread was made on site and the meats were fresh and of premium quality. I appreciated that and it helped me to make my choice.   We decided on the Steak & Wiz and the Steak & Provolone. Total bill was just over $27 with 2 cans of pop and tax. The Hoagies were quite tasty and good due to the premium ingredients used. Although, the Steak & Provolone was very oily, so much that it over soaked the bun which detracted from my experience. I found that the steak was too finely shaved which made the meat taste more like ground beef than a shaved beef. Usually, It's not a problem with cheap tougher meat , but the meat here was so tender that it actually was noticeable, and I'm glad it was.  I've had quite a few \"Philly\" style Hoagies and must say OMG does a good job with their Fresh & Premium approach as well as taste. Visually, the Hoagie looked empty and doesn't match the expectation for price so that may be a detractor for me as I did expect a large stuffed Hoagie, as I find in other places, it looked measured to me.  I have yet to try the burgers and poutine so all hope is not lost. I'll be back OMG!"}
