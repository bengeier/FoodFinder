{"text":"I've been to Galito's a few times as its across the street from my company. I like the speed of service and quality of food. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who feels like having grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good! I don't remember what it was called but I had the sandwich with pineapple in it."}
{"text":"We usually get the family meal here.  Food is decent.  You order and pay at the counter and seat yourself and get your own cutlery."}
{"text":"I'm gonna use Nando's for comparison because of similar menus and this is a flame-grilled chicken franchise (although South African instead of Portuguese but similar food and use of peri-peri chicken).  It is a family fast food type restaurant but it looks really nice with quite a few servers and you can sit at and eat so it's not as crowded with small tables as Nando's. They play loud music though (and it's not the elevator type).  The chicken itself was better than nando's and their sauce is really good. It has more flavour without being over the top spicy. The chicken was really well grilled. The sides were average though. Fries were good but garlic bread was the hard rather than soft type and rice didn't have much flavour.  They also have wings, beef kababs, rolls, sandwiches and some other stuff which aren't done too well at Nando's so I'd give them the advantage and prices and serving sizes aren't bad either. This is in the south part of Mississauga so it would be nice if they opened one in the north or west part. Flame grilled chicken is good, it's not the best food to get when you go out to eat imo because you can make something similar at home but if you happen to be in this area then I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The flame grilled chicken is delicious! The peri-peri fries are hand-cut, perfectly golden brown and spicy. If you don't like it hot, try the lemon sauce, it's super tasty. Overall I was impressed with the quality and flavour. Service is a little slow but it's worth waiting for. If only they would open a location in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Galitos for lunch, for the first time today. We were looking forward to trying their chicken since it was advertised to be - \"The healthiest, tastiest flame grilled chicken in the World\"    We were extremely disappointed. The chicken was so dry it was like eating sawdust. The flavour was ok but nothing special. The price was extremely expensive for what we ordered. Over $30 for 2 chicken meals one side each and 2 drinks. Won't be going back or recommending this restaurant anytime soon. Our experience was very disappointing - we pledge to never go back."}
{"text":"I think they have a new cook or owner. I'm used to coming here and eating delicious chicken not its very watery and their hot sauce is not the same its very liquidy. Over all not a bad meal but disappointed at what I ate. Hope they step up their game and stop this cost cutting of making cheap quality food. Also Nandos is right around the corner if you want real chicken. This place has a fake photocopy feeling"}
{"text":"Came at 11:15 pm , suppose to close at midnight & the staff were very rude & refused to take my order !  Seriously !!"}
{"text":"You're not Arby's!  Craving some roast beefery one day I drove to what I thought would be my once-a-year Arby's indulgence.  Roast beef sandwich, curly fries, Arby's sauce, I obviously don't need to go on.  Upon arrival I found that my precious middle-upper-middle class of an American fast food chain was seized!  I guess the 4th Amendment doesn't apply up in these neck of the woods.  Anyway, what I got instead was a pretty decent meal.  The chicken was juicy and the rice wasn't bad either.  Now I know everyone wants to compare them to Nando's, and that's because it's pretty much exactly that, which is a good thing!    Galitos: A non-Arby's, non-Nando's Nando's restaurant that will leave you mostly satisfied."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the grilled peri peri chicken and peri peri fries. Even tried the rice and it was superb quality. Would come back any day."}
{"text":"Better than the nandos in missisauga. Much spicier. It's also a Portuguese chain. I would go again."}
{"text":"I had tried this on my last visit to Toronto,  and found it to be delicious and satisfying!  I had ordered food for takeout and I was pleasantly surprised with the generous portions!"}
{"text":"I tried it because I had heard that it was a similar taste to Nando's but didn't think it would compare. However, I was mistaken cause it was great! I got the chicken burger & peri fries, like I usually do at Nandos. But I found the chicken burger patty to be a lot thicker and same with the bread and the fries were great as well. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Why would anyone install the AC air vent right on top of the dinner? My chicken turned cold after 5 mins. It was dry and tough like a rock. The food presentation wasn't great either. I would travel another 5 mins up north to Nando to get quality chicken.."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with galito's but to be honest.... I'm tired of these chicken places. They all taste the same. We need more rotisseries. That said. Galito's has awesome staff and great food. The peri fries are decent but I'd go with the potatoes or rice. The chicken is well cooked and not dry.   Put that garlic sauce doe and you're set. Seen"}
{"text":"A nice alternative to Nando's (which is usually pretty busy and it's sometimes hard to get a table). Every time I have gone to Galitos, there were maybe two or three other families in the restaurant and there was plenty of space.The chicken is good and they have several spice levels similar to Nando's."}
{"text":"Just like Nando's chicken but the rice is much better  and larger.  But priced the same."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken breast and roasted corn and roasted potatoes on the side.. it was money worth lunch for me. Would certainly be going this weekend . And the cashier girl gave me extra breast for take away. Totally satisfied,staff was good, cashier girl was well mannered ,polite and asked me hows the food."}
{"text":"Never again! This was a staple for lunch during the week but now it'll be taken off the list. I went today and ordered two quarter chickens with peri peri fries. They served the guy before me who ordered platters of stuff within 10 minutes and then they served the people after me who ordered exactly what I did and FINALLY after 30 minutes they had my order ready. This was only after I went to the counter because I could see my order sitting there waiting to be packed and no one was doing anything.  Horrible service and my chicken wasn't even cooked as usual so ended up throwing most of it out. Go to Nando's instead, its worth the bit of a longer drive!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Double Kabob with Rice and Piri Piri Fries for lunch is addictive.  The people at this location are amazing.  One time I forgot to grab my drink after I left. I had no issue going back to pick it up, however I called to let them know. They had a person drive and drop it off to me at my place of work.  That is customer service !!  Great food .. Great service !"}
{"text":"Been here twice,first in 2014 than a year later. Both time the food and services was crappie. .. don't waste you're money. The food is horrible!! The chicken was bitter the rice and potatoes are nasty  And the sald is a joke. I really wanted to like this place that's why I tried to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I would give this place a ~3.5 stars~  I have been ignoring this place as I always thought it was same as Nandos. After trying the food at a yelp Elite event, I thought to give it a try. The place is very good, they have good size seating area with many comfortable couch booths.   This has a similar concept as Nandos and Mesh which is self server. You will have to order at the front and get your own cutlery, plates and sauces from the side booths. They do bring the food to your table.  The food came out quick and was nice and hot.   We ordered a Whole Chicken meal (1 chicken, 1 large side & 2 garlic sticks), an extra large side and Galito's signature steak sandwich.    The chicken was done well and was not burnt but need more sauce on it when being grilled. As for the sides we tried Peri Rice which was quite good, and Peri Roasted Potatoes these were mini round potatoes and were good but need more sauce.   The Steak sandwich was very good as you could feel the meat and egg. The steak was cooked well and for the side I had Coleslaw which was not too sweet.  Their sauces taste very different and are very good. That was the highlight of the meal here.  For my halal eaters, I talked with the owner at the event and he stated they serve zabiha by hand halal meat.   Over all the decent food better than Nandos (as they have very similar type and style) and cant compare to Mesh as they do a thing differently."}
{"text":"I ordered the half chicken with 2 sides (peri peri rice and roasted potatoes). Had it made \"hot\" on the heat level. The chicken was tender and the flame grill taste was prominent. The peri peri rice was alright and the roasted potatoes were not that great. Would recommend for the flame grill taste."}
{"text":"Always liked the food and sauces that I always buy.  Lately the service has not been too great.  Last time we were told to get our own plates. Which was surprising. Never done that in a restaurant before.   Went with a group of friends and they didn't tell us something that we ordered wasn't available.   My friend waited and when we had all gotten our food that's when they tell us. She had to order something else and wait some more.  Manager wasn't too apologetic about it.   Will still keep going because i like the food but service especially from the manager and with a smile and better attitude would be nice."}
{"text":"While the food was whatever, their service is so bad I can't go back.  The first time around the cashier tried to \"forget\" to give us our change back while we watched him and  could clearly tell he was contemplating being honest. We decided to go back and give them a second chance. Second time we drove all the way across the city to eat there mainly because it was one of the few places open until 12 am (as stated on their business pages). We get there at 10:30 and the cashier tells us they're closed. Done with this place."}
{"text":"Went there today and got the same order as last time and the peri peri rice and roasted veggies were old and rotten. The rice smelled like it had been going bad for a few days the vegetables were shrived and the smelled repugnant. I ate the chicken on its own and then called them to tell them what was wrong with my dinner. Turns out the worst thing isn't their food, it is how they treat their customers. The lady I spoke with was so rude, did not even apologize, rushed me off the phone and told me to call back when the manager was there. What kind of a business that wants to retain people serves them rotten food then don't have the decency to apologize? I do NOT recommend this place because I couldn't guarantee you would get food that isn't rotten."}
{"text":"I could not agree with my fellow Yelper Toni, same story went there with my wife for dinner, ordered 2 chicken dinners, the chickens were super dry and no flavor, my side was rice and it was horrible, my wife's side order was baked potatoes supposed be served with sour cream, when asked the gave us watered down Raita (yogurt chutney )   we did not put our foot in there ever again, the only good thing about his place was the service, it was very friendly and welcoming!  PS. it is Halal!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and big as compare to other locations. And the chicken was really great we enjoyed a lot and service was awesome love it"}
{"text":"First time going with a friend tonight, it was AMAZING. Seriously delicious chicken, little potatoes and corn on the cob was so yummy!! I the flame grilled flavor! And not that my BBQ is down for the winter, I will deff come here!! Can't wait to go back and try more. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken! So much better than Nando's! The servers are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"There's supposed to be one opening up in Milton, but we couldn't wait for then, so we went to this Mississauga location.   I would compare this place to Nandos for sure, but the service was much better at Galitos. The two of us ordered a full chicken with two medium sides instead of 1 large side (same price). It was delicious, and I enjoyed it with the hot and garlic sauce mixed together. The sides were alright. We got fries and Peri roasted potatoes. The potatoes got cold quick unfortunately so we didn't end up eat them all.  Overall, this place had delicious chicken, and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"i love this place! we've been addicted to it since the first time we tried it!  the food is amazing! the service is really fast and the price is very good compared to the portions you are getting!"}
{"text":"The food at Galitos is always good. Their Garlic and Hot Sauce is fantastic. I would recommend getting the Peri Mayo for your fries as it goes well with.  My main complaints would be more so how stingy they can be when asking for extra sauce.  I have asked for crispy fries before and the response I got was \"the fries are always crispy\" in which my fries were no where close to that"}
{"text":"Ready to eat a horse or rather a chicken after spending the entire day at Canada's Wonderland and another hour getting out of their fricking parking lot.  Friendly and fast service and none of  that weird sit down first and then go up and order nonsense of Nando's.  Very similar menu to Nando's and we ordered the double skewers and the chicken leg with one side.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted good.  I admit I prefer Nando's peri peri sauces as they seem to have a bit more depth to them.  Galito's lemon and herbs peri peri sauce was tasty!  The portions seem a bit more generous than Nando's as well."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food. Chicken was dry, and almost charcoaled  .. garlic bread and fries were the only palatable items. Will not take a chance again."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, delicious food. Peri peri fries are on point. They give you a lot of little peri peri sauce samples when you do take out and offer free can of pop or bottled water when waiting for your take out. I've had the quarter chicken and the wings. Portions are huge. I would go back."}
{"text":"In the mood for chicken .... so here we are on a Saturday night.  Ordered garlic sticks, 1/4 chicken leg with roasted peri potatoes and double skewers with fries.  Very similar and comparable to Nando's.  I enjoyed my perfectly cooked chicken with the garlic peri peri sauce and the service was friendly.  Done!  Similar to Nando's in that you order up front, get a number, and they bring your food over."}
{"text":"Found this place near my work and was glad I did ! I really like peri peri chicken and am happy that's it's so accessible to me now haha.   The owner was extremely friendly in explaining the menu to us and helping us decide what to order. The overall atmosphere was also great everything (including the bathroom) was extremely clean and well organized.  The food itself was delicious, I ordered a chicken sandwich with peri fries. The sandwich had a nice spicy taste with a lemon flavour to it. The peri fries were also a nice side, I really like the seasoning they put on them. Overall this place is great just a tad bit expensive."}
{"text":"The first time we visited was about two years ago. The place just opened and I wasn't so impressed with the food. But every time I go to T & T, I could smell their chicken (both are in the same area) so I decided to give it another try. We did takeout and found the food is way better than on our first visit.  We've been back there multiple times. I like the double leg, corn, rice, and peri-peri fries. I find the chicken leg is juicier than the other cuts. The chicken is grilled just right with slight charring. It's perfect for me!  We tend to go there for early dinner so it's not busy. Sometimes, we just have the place to ourselves. Service is good.  You order and pay at the counter but they bring the food to your table."}
{"text":"Checked it out with one of my buddy's recently. I had the half chicken with parisienne potatoes. It tasted great and I was happy with the service, but my only issue was the format. So, you go in and select your meat and side. From here, you decide what level of heat you want for the chicken AND your side. Maybe it depends on your side, but I had the same sauce and flavor all over your plate. It wasnt like it was a bad sauce, but I just dont want everything tasting the same. I am definitely going back, but sticking to veggies or a side that doesnt have to have the sauce to it to avoid this matter again."}
{"text":"The service at this location is absolutely above standard...Everyone from the cashier to server to kitchen staff all seem so kind.  As well as service , Taste and quantity of food definitely worth it.  Clean , quantity , quality and taste...can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Nothing really bad about them.  Chicken was cooked well and tender.  But  i expected Portuguese chicken when I walked in. It's actually \"Portuguese \" style and they don't offer the traditional Piri Piri sauce which makes a huge difference for me."}
{"text":"I love the Galitos Chicken - the flavour and the nicely grilled meat. This location is consistent with all locations.  However, the server was not helpful in making suggestions. It was a take what is available sort of  service. In addition, she was more interested in seeing to the sit down guest rather than takeout.  I would go again for the food but the service is disappointing."}
{"text":"I went here at a time when it was completely empty, and I loved it. Got my food quickly and everything was delicious. If I'm nitpicking, my only concern would be the price you pay for the food, but overall including my experience I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight with my teenage daughter and we enjoyed it. Food was very taste but the 1/4 chicken was a bit tough. Food portion was ok"}
{"text":"Love it. Been driving by for a year, decided to stop in and try. It's quality food for reasonable prices. Love the chicken! Very unique taste."}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say, but it's a good alternative to Nando's.  Something I would have once in a while."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Place is clean, fast friendly service and food is fresh and tasty. Only gripe about the coleslaw salad to much dressing and rice on bland side."}
{"text":"Great Food!! well made chicken, full of flavor.  Portions are reasonable, price is okay because the flavorful food was on point.  This place is new and it needs to be tasted.  Our service Hostess was a little slow, my daughter's burger was sitting and getting cold and she was on the phone, until after 15 mins of wait, she went up and grabbed it herself.  Menu had Steak burger, which family wanted to try, but they didn't have it.  it was at the end of night and only 2 families were there, but the dirty tables weren't cleaned up, and the clean tables were sticky.  if the Owner pays attention to these minor issues this place will be booming in no time.  This is not a fast food place, and the prices speak for itself it would be nice to have the place reflect that.  we ordered 5 burger's and a family meal, and 4 drinks, it cost like $110.  I will be coming back! loved it more than Nan- - 's ;) (u know the place)"}
{"text":"I love char-grilled chicken and I ordered extra hot.  The counter girl double checked that I wanted it that way :)  I ordered the family dinner that included bread sticks and two sides.  We ordered the piri fries and rice.  I was a bit bummed out when our order came as I noticed a small promo sign on the counter for piri potatoes.   I would have ordered those instead of fries as I love them.  They were not on their main menu board.  I am fairly fussy about fries and rice so all I can say is that they were okay.  However the chicken was fantastic. The flavour was excellent and is different than Nando's.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice clean restaurant.   I got there at 11:00am when they first opened.  I ordered the half chicken with rice and roasted potatoes.    Chicken was tender and cooked perfect.    The hot sauce really complimented the chicken and the rice.  The potatoes were nice and soft too.   I would definitely come here again.   Way better than Nando's !!"}
{"text":"There was nothing for me to distinguish my first experience at Galito's from any experience at Nando's. That's a good thing.   The chicken is flavourful at any of the spice levels and the Peri sauce will always make anything taste good, fries especially.   Great restaurant. There needs to be more of these."}
{"text":"This place is nothing like nandos. The chicken is super saucey for a BBQ experience. They drench it in sauce after its booked rather than while its being cooked on gas fire BBQ. The hot sauce looks brown and taste like its mixed with BBQ sauce. I'm not trying to be negative but this place is waste of money. It's very clean place tho thats the only plus."}
{"text":"I've been eating out a lot recently so had decided yesterday morning that my lunch would be just fruit. Then I got a notification about a Galito's Groupon, so what's a girl to do?  The deal was $13 (+ taxes) for 1 whole chicken, 2 breadsticks, and 1 large side.   You order/pay upfront and then the server brings the food to your table. Garlic and Hot Peri Peri sauces are available to use as you wish (and they are delicious!).  The chicken was juicy and marinated well. In terms of the quality of the food, I don't think it's a whole lot different than the other Portuguese-style chicken places we have here (and I generally enjoy them all other than the odd time it's not as fresh or portion is smaller), but the service here was notable for this kind of quick-service restaurant.   The manager taking the order asked if I wanted white meat only. I prefer white meat and it's never been suggested as an option to me before, so I happily took it. Mid-meal, the server checked-in asking how we were liking the food. At the end, another associate noticed that we were done eating but had leftovers so she asked us if we needed a takeout container. Again, for a fast food style restaurant, this was impressive."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a different kind of chicken, this is worth a try. A bit like Nandos, but without the drive.  This is Portuguese churrasco style chicken, juicy, marinated, with a variety of spicy, exciting sauces to really leave an impression.   Since Galitos is located near Vaughan Mills, it is also very close to my regular stop at Chatime. Big win for me!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok, not bad, not great, but Ok. Had a Groupon which was 50% off a whole chicken meal, I would buy another Groupon, but would buy this at regular price."}
{"text":"I only ordered take out from them so this is based on that. I wanted to try something new aside from the ones we were familiar with and I must say, I actually prefer Galito's better.  I ordered the hot double leg with peri fries and I love it! Its well seasoned and the kick of the hot sauce was up my alley. My husband also loved his (same order) but he got it just mild with side of roasted potatoes. We both agreed that it didnt taste dry like the other places and its actually very filling.  Am definitely going to order/dine in from them from now on when am craving for some good grilled chicken.  One less star because I havent tried the other ones in their menu.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It rivals Nando's up the street. More or the less the same food for the same price. Even the decor and menu are nearly identical."}
{"text":"Galitos speciality is BBQ chicken with peri peri sauce. They give you a choice of mild, medium or hot. I had half chicken with peri fries. Its chicken was mouth watering and the Peri sauce added an extra kick. The service is quick and friendly. I will be going back.   Also, The chicken is halal."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse chicken I ever had, undercooked, and terrible marination. Nothing compare to Nando's. We ordered a whole chicken and wings, never again having wings there, too expensive and not tasty at all. Too bad this place used to be a lot better"}
{"text":"Went to Galito's today, in my opinion their Chicken is better than Nando's, coupled with nice bright, open & clean restaurant. Service was spot on, our waitress was very attentive and made frequent visits to check on if we needed anything. Wings were little dry however Whole chicken was really moist and delicious. Overall experience was 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is another one of those restaurants that I've passed by many times and finally decided to take a look at. Galito's is a small chain of Portuguese-style peri-peri chicken outlets similar to Nando's. I've tried peri-peri chicken a number of times from different places, so I thought I would see how good this place is.   Overall, it's a good place, especially if you're looking for a halal establishment (which fortunately this place is if you're a Muslim diner). Like Nando's (and Sizzlo's, which I've also tried), you have a choice of dinners and a choice of how hot and spicy you want it. There's a decent choice of sides.  I went on a Friday afternoon, when it was not too busy but not quiet either, so I would imagine that it could get pretty busy during the peak times. Based on the food, I can see why. The food is cooked well, the service is good (you order at the counter but a server brings you your order), and the price is reasonable. One person can have lunch for less than $15.   There are a number of good peri-peri chicken places out there now, but if you're in the area, Galito's is a good option."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and the main reason we came was because the closest Nandos had a long wait (it is quite small). I am glad we came...I think their food is better tasting than Nandos. Their chicken is better charred (we asked for well done), coleslaw was more flavorful, and garlic sticks were much better than the typical garlic bread. Fries / corn were the same. I think going forward we'll be coming here with the family.   Although the restaurant was white packed, our food came on time and the server was very helpful."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a friends recommendation and he told me the taste is better than Nando's. I do not think it comes even close to Nando's, I felt the chicken was dry and had no sauce on it like how Nando does. Will not waste my money here again"}
{"text":"I went to this place after reading the reviews.. this place is not even 0.5% close to nandos. I hated the food and the sauces.. does not taste portuguese at all. Will never go back"}
{"text":"If you like Nandos, then you will LOVE this place. This takes Nandos to another level. Perfectly cooked moist chicken with lots of flavour. The spicy peri peri chicken has a good flavourful kick. And the peri peri fries are a good compliment to the chicken.  Decent size place, clean and spacious. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals quietly, except us, since we were an army of 15 strong (with kids) hungry desis. Overall, i would definitely come here again.  As for Nandos, nice knowing you"}
{"text":"The customer service has gone down the drain. They don't even have proper lunch specials anymore. It's getting crappier and crappier. The ice is prone to bacteria due to the way they store the ice as well."}
{"text":"Not the best place for your grilled chicken cravings. When I went I ordered the chicken sandwich. The chicken wasn't exactly \"freshly grilled tasting\" nor was it flavourful. I'd skip this place if you're looking for an interesting place to try."}
{"text":"As there is no Nandos in the area, this is a great alternative. Reasonably priced, super-friendly staff, and great food. I think the only downside is that they don't have Piri-Piri sauce, but they have a lot of other options. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Nice place for families and friends, I loved the marinated mild chicken and the fresh fries."}
{"text":"Enjoyable Portuguese chicken... not sure why its under South African on Yelp.  Staff very accommodating and this place is child friendly.    The reason I didn't put up a fourth star is that everything tasted more or less the same to me.  Cooked well and seasoned but all of one note."}
{"text":"Loved the food here.  Everything from the service to the taste was top notch.   This was by far the best peri peri style chicken I've ever had.  Would definitely come back ."}
{"text":"I tried Galito's today hoping to introduce piri piri chicken to my wife.   The ambience and service was nice (although we couldn't fit in our booths, they are way too small and we're not big people), but the food was subpar.  I ordered a double leg with roasted potatoes - the potatoes were undercooked and bland, and the piri sauce tasted of too much vinegar (like Tabasco).  My wife had a chicken sandwich with piri piri fries - the hostess offered cheese on the sandwich for an additional $1, which turned out to be a Kraft single. This cheapened the taste of the sandwich, and the fries were undercooked and dusted with what seemed like over the counter Cajun seasoning.   Ultimately not worth the $25 spent on our meal. Don't expect restaurant quality, expect fast food."}
{"text":"We were looking for fish & chips this Good Friday but everything was jammed. So we ended up going to Galito BBQ'ed Chicken. We ordered the full chicken meal. The chicken was extremely tasty but the sides left something to be desired. Had coleslaw & garlic bread with side veggies. The waitress was a delightful smiling young lady that made ordering easy. Comfortable spot that I would go back to again."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for some time. Excellent service, delicious food, fast and easy take out. Comfortable and clean space."}
{"text":"Ive come here 3 or 4 times and Im finally getting around to reviewing it! They have a few $10 lunch options which are super great and really filling, despite my size I do eat a lot.  I get the quarter chicken white with rice and an extra side of rice, since I prefer the rice to the potatoes they serve. The rice is awesome seasoned perfectly and they give me loads of it. The chicken breast is large as well so you're totally getting your $11.30 worth!  The food is always fresh and warm when I get it, i order the chicken extra hot and I dont personally this its too spicy but thats just my preference  I call ahead and go through the drive through window. It's super easy and quick. The normal wait time for my order is 10-15 minutes so that's basically my drive there and its always hot and ready when i pull knto the drive thru.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating and its one of the best lunches in the area for cheap! I highly recommend it. Tasty like nandos but you get more food for much less."}
{"text":"Did not taste as gold as I expected. The rice tasted more like Asian rice. The sauces were also a disappointment. Their are way better places"}
{"text":"The first time i ever went to Galito's was in South Africa, so i was super-super excited to here that it opened up here in the GTA.   An alternative to Nando's, this is another flame grilled delicious - i will eat a whole chicken - kind of place. Don't bother with anything but the grilled chickens. That's the star. The sides are whatever - standard fare (minus the peri peri fries). Don't expect to be blown away by the sides - just expect to be blowing your nose from the spice/heat levels in the chicken.   Overall, good for takeout. Feed the family. Feed the office. Whatever. It's tasty as hell. Use your hands. Just remember that the quality we are limited to is the quality of chickens in Canada."}
{"text":"Like previous posters mentioned, this place is similar to Nando's. Except the food and the service is much better than Nando's.  It's hard not to like Portuguese style chicken and peri-peri goodness. The portions are big and the food is never dry or burnt (as it's often the case at Nando's). The service is good and pretty quick. There is plenty of tables available, if you'd like to eat in but take out and delivery are also an option. Open until midnight."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Toronto Airport West hotel and wandered down a couple of blocks and found this place for lunch. I ordered the 10$ double kebab lunch special which came with rice and I opted for potatoes as my one side. The food came out in a timely fashion and the place was very clean. The chicken kebab was great.. a little char on the outside and moist on the inside with a flavorful marinade. The rice was okay...and the potatoes were nice as well. Overall..for a ten buck lunch, its definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Never coming here again. I was expecting Portuguese style chicken and was incredibly disappointed. Came with my husband and kids, we had the mixed grill for 3. The chicken was dry,  the kebobs were dry and spicy, the rice tasted like minute rice. I think the highlight of the meal were the fries, the only edible thing. Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"This place is freakin FANTASTIC! I am so upset that I recently discovered this little gem because I  could have been eating here for YEARS! I've driven by the Galito's sign multiple times and one Monday afternoon I decided to finally go inside.   The restuarant is small but cute and nicely decorated. All the plates, utensils, napkinds and condiments are located to the right (you set it up youself, it took me a bit to catch on HAHA). The young lady at the front desk is sweet and informative and you can see the men in the kitchen working hard and putting love into your food.  We ordered the Galito's mixed grill for 31.00 it comes with 1/2 chicken, 2 kebobs, 4 wings, 2 red sides and garlic sticks. We chose peri perri fries and roasted corn ont he cop as our side and ordered an additional coleslaw and drinks. Our meal came to about 44 dollars after tax. Let me tell you honey, it was worth it.  The meat is moist and seasoned to perfection, the coleslaw was creamy and acidic, the fries has a nice kick with the peri peri spice blend, the corn was sweet and charred, and the garlic sticks were soft, garlicly and delicious. My only complain were the kebobs I found them dry and gave them to my boyfriend, but I prefer dark meat so that may be why. I'd also reccomend their spicy honey garlic saucer for your wings.   After our meal we were stuffed and have more then enough to take home and eat again. My boyfriend loved it and I am sure we will be back this weekend."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant because it was opened on Christmas Day. Reminded me of Nando's. Very clean with great service. Ordered a few items like the steak sandwich, chicken wings, chicken poutine and garlic sticks. The food was good, wished they had more flavours because things started to taste the same (especially when you choose the same heat level for chicken AND steak)."}
{"text":"HALAL  This place has great chicken and their peri peri sauce is quite delicious. We ordered from here for pickup and the taste was quite good but it just seemed a bit less marinated than another location we tried.   Still a great chicken place and their food is good overall."}
{"text":"Okay, yup.. just because of you guys, I came here.. You know that? No, I'm serious.. I was going to stick to Nando's because when I had it the first time in brampton location, I thought it was delicious!! So anyway, I tried it and blah blah blah.. and it was Okay. I don't get it? I mean, okay.. yes it was good/decent.. Who doesn't like bbq? I found the chicken to be a bit bland but I love the smokey bbq flavor and the sauce on the chicken (I got Extra Hot Sauce) you know I'm the saucy girl.. Love my extra sauces on the side, just in case it\"s bland.. haha.. lol but the chicken could of added a bit more seasoning or salt. It was very moist. Next time I might try the Lemon & Herb chicken instead of the Hot sauce one.. I don't know if I'm willing to take that risk again.. I wouldn't go out of my way to order this but maybe if I were in the area? Hmm.. The customer service was very kind and quick. The potatoes were Bland and I told the guy extra sauce on the potatoes (Guess again.. he didn't do it) no big deal.. I literally put a pinch of salt on the potatoes and the rice. The rice was okay, the color was nice but it needed salt and I added some. I would never come here for the sides, if I had no choice but to eat here again.. I'd stick to the bbq chicken.. I think they should take the flavoring into consideration.. I don't know if I recommend this place.. seems a lot of humans do.. not sure.."}
{"text":"Came here after reading all these reviews, and I prefer Nandos chicken. This place is a dupe of Nandos chicken, but the sauces are different. Wait time for food is around the same as Nandos. Chicken was fresh, but the sauces were not tasty, sauce makes a difference for me. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken is a franchise from South Africa serving flame grilled chicken with Peri Peri Sauce.  I arrived 5 minute before 3 pm so I can still take advantage of their LUNCH SPECIALS, where there are 5 choices for $7.99 each.  This review is going to be bias... as I think there was some misunderstanding!!! I want to have the 1/4 chicken with Rice but ended up I was served:  Chicken Strips on Rice with Peri Peri Fries and Cole Slaw ($7.99)  - I don't really like white meat. Yes it is a healthier choice but why I want to eat chicken that were so dry, chewy and tough.. I don't really know..... - So dried chicken bland, chewy and dry with no amount of hot Peri Peri sauce that would able to save it!! - I don't really like the yogurt sauce on top.. - I don't really like the fries as they are like frozen fries with Peri Peri powder sprinkled on top  Why am I gave this place a 2 star??  As a minimum service restaurant, you placed your order and they delivered it to your table. At least all the food are delivered on real plates and you got to eat using real forks and knives. My waitress/cashier kept checking on me and ask how my food was and if I need this or need that....  I would definitely give Galito another try... but I really need to get the Leg!! The moist, fatty, juicy legs!!! I cannot stand chewing on cardboard again!!"}
{"text":"My family has always been fans of Nando's Chicken so we were excited to give Galito's a try to see how they measure up.  Service was very friendly going in and ordering and were helpful since it was our first time (thanks Anne!).  When we sat at our table though, we couldn't help comparing the decor and style to Nando's. The wait time for our food was much longer too and Galitos wasn't exactly busy so we weren't quite sure what the hold up was.  When we were first brought our food it was the wrong order.  When we actually got our food, one of the side dishes orders was wrong (we ordered regular fries, we were given peri peri).  I ordered a leg. I honestly hoped it would be a comparable size to Nando's legs but they are indeed smaller. It was a little dry as well.  In terms of flavor, I have to say they went crazy with the salt. Nando's has always been on the salty side for me but Galitos kicked up the salt a whole other notch. After every bite I was grabbing my water bottle for a drink. The flavor was alright, nothing particularly special but it was slightly different from Nando's.  One person in our party was vegetarian, she ordered the vegie burger with the roasted peri peri vegetables. The burger was even saltier than the chicken and the vegetables were luke warm and completely raw. She couldn't finish her meal or side it because it was unbelievable inedible.  Overall I was a little disappointed with this experience. Other than the very pleasant staff, the food was less than mediocre. I'd suggest going to Nando's."}
{"text":"Came during a busy lunch service, but was served reasonably quickly. They have lunch specials and I opted for a double leg lunch, which comes with rice and roasted corn on the cob.  My partner ordered chicken kebabs and a mixed green salad for a side.  The orders came out in due course, starting with the corn and the salad. The corn was perfectly cooked, slightly charred in spots but not overdone. Thoughtfully came with a butter packet. The corn didn't disappoint, it was fresh and sweet. Tasted the salad my partner had and the dressing was quite zesty and had great flavour and the greens were fresh.  The chicken came and although a bit smaller than I expected, the peri peri marinade and crispy skin were bursting with flavour. The rice complimented the dish well although it was too much to finish in one sitting an do took the rest home.  They also had cakes and desserts on display but sadly we were too stuffed, but will be certain to make a return trip.  Overall this location is great, lots of space, even a separate dining room for larger groups.  The food and counter service format is comparable to a Nando's, but I think they do it just a bit fresher and quicker here."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  service was attentive, chicken was perfectly grilled and juicy.  grilled vegetables were done just right and the portions was large.  they really dont stinge on the food here.  ive been to nando's many times and this place beats nandos by far.  only thing was the location is kind of hidden and far for me."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look too impressive on the outside due to location but it doesn't get enough credit for how amazing the food is inside!   The restaurant is really nicely decorated inside and had an amazing server who helped to guide us on ordering as we never been there before.    The peri-peri flavour should be packaged and sold.  It was so tasty.  The chicken was so juicy and the atmosphere was amazing.  Definitely going to do take out whenever I get the chance!   For the type of restaurant it is.  Cheap and good eat!"}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the food was amazing! I've tried Nando's before and I'd have to say Galito's blows them out of the water.  We arrived on a Friday evening and was instantly greeted by the man at the cashier. He patiently waited for us to decide on what we were going to order. Afterwards, he answered any questions that we had and mentioned things that we wouldn't have known ourselves. He definitely was very friendly and knew how to provide excellent customer service. We ordered the whole chicken meal with a regular side of fries and peri roasted potatoes. I think next time I will try the peri peri fries because the peri roasted potatoes tasted good.  After ordering we sat down at a booth and waited for our order. It didn't take that long compared to the last time we were at Nando's. Everything that came out looked good and tasted amazing. The lemon and herb flavoured chicken was flavourful and succulent..not dry like others have mentioned (thank goodness!). The chicken tasted even better with the garlic sauce. The sauce is really good that I would even consider buying a bottle for my house.   What a great experience we had at Galito's! I have no idea why my Naveen S. only gave it 4 stars lol. I will definitely return and also try the Milton location whenever they decide to open."}
{"text":"The best grilled chicken! Go for the hot level and get their garlic sauce on the side. Service is okay, I usually get it to go. Peri peri fries are great too...definitely better than nandos."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken place. Great timing too, fast and easy to work with. The staff here, are so nice and helpful and somehow they always seem to remember my order! :)"}
{"text":"Im an avid reviewer on Google so this is my first Yelp review. The employers here SEXUALLY HARRAS their employees. So if you condone this, go ahead and come here but if you're a halfway decent human, skip this location because their behaviour is repulsive and criminal and I will never stop until everybody knows about it. NEVER."}
{"text":"Spent a week in Toronto and on the last evening decided to try Portuguese food since I'm from Portugal and I was quite curious to taste flavors from home so far away from it. We gambled. We failed. Not due to the food's taste, don't get me wrong. It was absolutely delicious!!! Except it wasn't Portuguese. Right from the moment we entered the establishment we could see it had nothing to do with Portugal, but still we proceeded with our choice. All over the menu/pamphlet is Africa. Nothing against it, but... is it because some African countries were Portuguese colonies? All good! I just had something different in mind. The only true downside was our cashier/server. Young girl, thick accent, but as an immigrant myself I do not judge. The problem was that she got our order wrong. Three times. We ordered, we immediately saw she got it wrong on the screen facing us. No big deal. We repeated, pointing at the menu, being nice, since we're understanding and somewhat shy. She still got it wrong. She grabbed the menu, read it, we pointed and explained it to her and somehow she still got it wrong. Fourth time was the charm, I guess... I would try it one more time whenever I go back to Canada, because the food we had was quite tasty and maybe the girl was just on an off day."}
