{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants hamds down. The martinis are amazing (jolly rancher), the salads and antipesto are so tasty. I always love the cozy feeling in tge winter and the hot patio with ferry lights in the summer. Great staff and amazing location."}
{"text":"Geez. There seems to be some negative buzz surrounding this place. Most of the stuff I read made it seem like there wasn't any shot of much good coming out of it. So, imagine my surprise when the food was good, the service was attentive, and the overall experience was one that I'd come back for.

In all fairness, a lot of that negative stuff I read was about their Theatre district location on King West, which I've neer been to, but that just doesn't hold much value for me. The fact is, most of those places on that strip of King seem to get a bad rap. Get 'em in, get 'em fed, get 'em out; that's their philosophy as they wait for theatre goers to arrive, and then again when they hope for them to come back after the show... thankfully, Hey Lucy's Annex location isn't anything like that.

With their soft lighting, chandeliers and black-and-white cow print seats, it's difficult to describe what exactly they were going for when they designed this place, but somehow, it works well and provides a nice backdrop, particularly for a date night. The ambience is hip, the decor is comfortable and cozy, and the space is of a decent enough size that it can easily accommodate both large groups and couples.

Hey Lucy is busy in the summer evenings, mostly because of their killer patio that lines the entire side of the building. Perfect for people-watching, this packed space is a nice addition to The Annex, and it holds up well against other patios on the street (except for Pauper's Pub!).

Probably what Hey Lucy is most well-known for is their martinis. They've got a pretty decent martini menu with some interesting things on it, like the Godzilla and the Freedom 55, but man, these guys are expensive. Although they do come with a minimum of 2 ounces of booze, you can expect to shell out 9 bucks plus taxes for one. And while that may seem ok at first, having a few of them can easily add up... trust me on that. If martinis are your thing, but getting ripped off for them isn't, then you're definitely going to want to come back on a Wednesday. Wednesday is Martini Wednesday at Hey Lucy, and the prices drop to 4 bucks for the exact same martinis. But come early, other people like a good deal when they see one too, and this place fills up pretty quickly.

Their menu doesn't follow any sort of style; it's a bit all over the place, but it's still the sorta thing you might expect from a place like this. Pastas, wood-fired pizzas, paninis, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good, but unfortunately, this can unexpectedly change once the place fills up. In Hey Lucy's case, it's better to go when it isn't that busy.

While I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Hey Lucy, if you're in the area and looking for a night out, Hey Lucy provides nicely."}
{"text":"I dined at the Bloor St location Twice last month as my sister lives down the street. I had always been to the King St location and NOW can truly say i will NEVER return to the Bloor St location. 
The service was horrible. The Food was terrible, even though both locations are owned by the same owner. 
The staff at the Bloor St location, it seemed were more there to hang out then provide decent service taking about 10 mins to even get glasses of water. 
Taking and making jokes with the Chefs who are NOWHERE nearly as good as the King St location Staff. 
SAD to say about one of my favourite restaurants but the owners really need to REVAMP the Bloor St location

KING ST LOCATION ALL THE WAY....BEST FOR SERVICE AND QUALITY OF FOOD.

BLOOR ST....BUNCH OF KIDS RUNNING THE PLACE."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now for weekend lunch. Loved it each time. 

Quirky but comfortable, very nice service by the waitresses, great guys in the kitchen (you can hear their conversation in the open kitchen) and super friendly bartenders. Prices are great, average $8-$12 per plate. Very good food for the price. 

Absolutely recommend the paninis, the pizza, and especially the mac & cheese. Make sure someone at your table orders the mac & cheese so you can steal a bite or two. Best I've had (including those ridiculous $25 versions with truffles etc).

Also great prices on martinis, and a pretty decent beer list."}
{"text":"Went after a jays game  for quick bite and drink. Was amazing staff were so helpful with my foodie  questions. Had the lemon drop martini and chicken pesto pizza both were fantastic. Totally going back for Wednesday martini night !!!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh the best place in town. Hot service, hot food, hot bartenders.  

Be there or be square. 

\"10 out of 10 would come again\" -said by fellow patron 

'Nuff said."}
{"text":"The older waitress, I believe her name is Jordan (at least that is what was on the receipt) left a bad taste in my mouth. I enjoyed my food, but as long as she is at this location, I will never come back and telling my friends and family to stay away. I did not deserve to spend my Saturday night being harassed and ridiculed. She was incredibly condescending. She tried to save face by the end of service when she realized she wanted tips. Yeah, too late. 

Why work in the service industry if you have such a strong hatred towards people and lack basic customer service? I understand every job is rough at times, but do not take it out on customers who did nothing to deserve it. She can singlehandedly ruin this restaurant. Awful, terrible service, and completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Was here for Sunday brunch on Valentine's weekend.  Great atmosphere, totally catering to the Annex crowd.  The menu was your average brunch menu.  Prices were alright.  Good spot to stop and have lunch at if you're in the area.  It's alright, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food was very very good (drinks as well)!!! I was (pleasantly) surprised given the prices. I had drinks and appetizers but I'll be back for sure!

(Space is a bit cramped. No walkway when seated- Other table had to move their chairs for us to get out.)"}
{"text":"I tried this place back in summer of 2015 and I have to say I was quite pleased.  I wasn't too sure what to expect but I am giving it a 5 stars.  I met up with some friends and we sat on the patio in the backyard.  Such a nice, quiet, quaint patio.  The fountain was on and the lights were twinkling and it wasn't loud (definite bonus).  The service was excellent and the food was excellent.  The drinks were even fabulous.  I have nothing bad to say regarding this place. It was such a nice relaxing patio to have some food and drinks on a warm summer night.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Steak pasta was very good. Beef was very tender and the sauce was rich and delicious. Pizza was also very good, especially the crust."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday. Loved the martini specials and varieties. Paired with the food which wasn't much to choose from but I was just there for the dranks (drinks) lol great for a girls night out."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of the restaurant, funky and inviting, and the service was great.  

However, the food was pretty bad.  The pizza looked good when we saw someone else have it, so my dinner companion ordered that, and I ordered a pasta dish. 

The pasta dish was barely edible, and that's about the nicest thing I can say about it. I can't even remember which one I ordered, only that it was definitely not worth the $13 they were charging for it, and the pizza (pepperoni, gp and mushrooms) had about as much flavor as a piece of cardboard. 

I would go back here for a drink, since I liked the decor and the atmosphere, but would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere with good music in the background. Extremely generous portions and an extensive cocktail list. I went here with a group of friends and we all left satisfied. The grilled calamari plate was loaded with extras and was very well done. The steak was cooked properly and came with a generous heap of fries. Good non-generic beers on tap. Servers were very attentive and friendly.

Overall, a very good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Disappointed that the atmosphere and service was ultimately negated by being served a refrigerated glass of settled foam from a keg change."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner here a few weeks ago around 5pm. We started with the Agnolotti Chips and they were awesome. For the main dish, I got the Mac and Cheese and my boyfriend got a chicken dish. We were both thoroughly pleased with the meal. On top of that, the service was fantastic and the prices were fair. We loved the feel of the place, and liked that when it got dark, they put candles on our table.
Overall, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Only went for dessert & drinks. Great location! Locale bar where locals hang and a good strip to be in on a Friday night. 
Fried cheesecake was very very good.
Cocktails are Ok. Not excellent. Not bad. Just ok. 
Wait staff though was not too impressive. I came in a group of 7 and we basically seated ourselves. Wait staff too frazzled about Friday crowd that they are not able to make decisions asap on seating. Also they seat people even if the party isn't complete yet. It proves to be detrimental if the rest of the party doesn't come on time. You end up with empty chairs & people always coming up to you asking if seats are taken. 
Overall, not bad. I have yet to try the food though!"}
{"text":"I usually only go to Hey Lucy on Wednesdays for martinis (they have the special at both locations).

I went this past Saturday with a group of friends for dinner. Our service was painfully slow, our meals arrived at different times, and some people had settled the bills with the server before others had finished eating (she just brought around the bills as that end of the table finished).

I've been before in a group of 4, or even just as two people, and haven't noticed really slow service, but perhaps they also have more staff working on Wednesdays. I think I'll stay away on Saturday nights and stick with somewhere that can handle the crowds."}
{"text":"Went to Hey Lucy for the Second time and it was pretty good.  Love the atmosphere of the Rooftop patio, cozy and comfortable for a night out with friends ! We went on a wednesday, Martini Wednesdays was a pleasant surprise! They were 4.50 or something for a large selection.  Food was also pretty good, we order the sharing platter for two of us but it was that filling, wouldn't suggest getting it for a large party looking to share, 3 people max ! We also ordered a calzone and it was filled with the good stuff.  Cant complain about that either. 
Our waitress was really nice but she seemed a bit lost most of the night.
We asked for an ashtray three times, but HEY if you want us to throw our butts on the ground NO PROB. 
We also had to ask for the bill a couple of times, the last time we asked she said she would bring it over, and to my surprise I saw her go inside, grab her things and leave. ughh ok, the other waitress who was cleaning had to take care of it after we asked her. 
Being in the customer service industry, I know that some times waiters can have off nights, but when you eat out, you shouldn't have to chase after the waiter, thats why they are called waiters. 

Will go back again, because i love the vibe.

{"text":"3 of us popped in for dinner. Nice pub style, after work casual atmosphere. We each ordered a different pizza: marguerita 
Vegetarian, smoked Bacon Pesto, all of which were very tasty forno oven baked thin crust. Definitely good enough to take home and take out later for late night snack!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot to offer and is the perfect place for a first date.  Here's why:

1.  Great zebra print chairs and banquets.
2.  Nice ambiance and great mood lighting.
3.  Great martini menu!

What I didn't like was the following:

1. Lack of beer menu.
2. The restaurant can be quite cold.
3. I think that this place is more focused on being hip than serving good food.  I sense that the food and drink are merely there to impress and not to completely taste good.

I would recommend this place to those who love a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Went there twice. First time was quite good, but the second time was terrible.

I went in there today ~4:30 for an early dinner with my friend. There were only 4 tables in total including us, but it took the waitress 10min to get us a glass of water to start. I ordered when she brought us out water, and my friend wasn't going to eat, so she told the waitress she would order her drinks a little later. 

20 min gone by and the waitress did not even come back and ask if my friend was ready to order her drink. But we didn't mind so much because we were too busy catching up with each other's lives. Another 10 min gone by and my food finally came. I ordered Bacon & Pesto Pizza and Fried Calamari. The Fried Calamari was terrible, it was just lukewarm and not crunchy at all. Also the seasoning was way off, there was an imbalance of salt and vinegar. Anyway, when I was taking a bite of my pizza, surprisingly I bit into a piece of wood that was hiding under the bacon!! I called the waitress back and told her about the situation, she apologized instantly but did not offer anything. I actually wanted the Prosciutto Pizza originally so I asked her if I can get a new one made but change it to the Prosciutto Pizza. And I offered to pay for the pizza regardless, since I wasn't sure if such changes were too much to ask for. She said yes, and brought back my Prosciutto Pizza 20min later. The pizza was bad. Crust was very hard and again, seasoning was way off (unlike the one I had the first time I was here!). 

The waitress came back a few times after and ask if we're doing okay, but she did not offer me a complementary drink/any discount/apologize again even though they made me bit into a piece of wood!!!! 

In the end i still tipped at least 10% because I felt bad. But HATED the food and service. The waitress was not professional and food is subpar. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy's pizzas are excellent! They also have a really nice patio in the summer time. Service has always been good and their apps are worth trying as well. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to come to on Wednesday wine nights $5 a glass. Great atmosphere and staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Used to have a good brunch here. They stopped serving the spicy beans and garnish on the ceaser. Also stopped using the regular ceaser rim and changed it to some cheap weird stuff. Last time I got the eggs Benny it was like a small slice of Black Forest ham on a muffin. Hardly the thick slice of peamale I was expecting, and the amount of home fries I got was smaller than the palm of my hand. I was still hungry after. They also stop serving brunch at 1pm now. Don't bother going here there's lots of other places that are much better"}
{"text":"Hey Lucy is a great place to kick back and relax with a few friends after a hard day at work.   These stars are not for the restaurant, but for the bar -- especially for their  3.99 martini night on Wednesdays! 

Hey Lucy has a very nice selection of different drinks -- if you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the Jolly Rancher martini.  

The best thing about Hey Lucy is the cozy atmosphere; I  particularly like the exposed brick and chandelier by the front entrance. The service is also very nice and charming.

So, if you ever find yourself craving a martini, especially on a Wednesday night, head on over to Hey Lucy!  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"A great little restaurant in the Annex has a martini special every Wednesday which is sure to satisfy that mid week cocktail craving. Hey Lucy has three locations in central and downtown Toronto-the others are situated at the corner of King & John in the entertainment district, and in Cabbagetown at Carlton & Parliament.

This particular Hey Lucy is just steps from the University of Toronto campus and brings a bit more class to a section of Bloor Street that is overflowing with a diverse array of dining options.

A pit stop here for drinks and maybe an appetizer or two is definitely in order for a Wednesday night out in the Annex, especially considering their $4.49 martini specials.

The decor has the feel of an upscale lounge, with decorative chandeliers adorning beautifully molded ceilings. It is small but inviting, with almost all booths making for a cozier dining experience. Exposed brick and wood paneling surprisingly complement zebra-print seats.

The martinis are comparable to Insomnia's down the street, varying on a sweetness spectrum ranging from Jolly Rancher and Caramilk to a potent Lemon Drop and the classic olive and vermouth. These 2oz. cocktails-otherwise priced at $8.99-make getting a seat or even a spot at the glimmering bar almost impossible on Wednesdays, and there are no reservations allowed on this particular evening: first come, first serve.

On a Friday evening, Hey Lucy is busy enough to feel like a hot spot, but not too packed that you feel suffocated. pic861

The pizza is cooked in an authentic wood burning oven and is thoroughly delicious, no matter the combination of toppings. Most go for $13-17, ranging from the classic Margherita to unusual combinations like their Smoked Bacon Pesto.

The nachos ($14) are a standout, with an array of rich grilled vegetables spread atop crisped flour tortillas. The pastas are a good value for the quality-my chicken primavera came loaded with vegetables and creamy alfredo sauce at just $14 for a large bowl. It is more than ridiculous that they charge an extra $2.50 for whole wheat pasta, however.

All in all, Hey Lucy is a good bet for a decent dining experience. It's certainly not the best, but it is definitely a place that we frequent a couple of times a year."}
{"text":"You must try the fried pasta appetizer mmmmmm and martini wednesday (similar to eat my martinis selection though not as extensive) but prepare to wait for a table bc it gets packed."}
{"text":"I'm a simple girl with simple taste. I like my lunches reasonably priced with a side of salad. And if at all possible, can I please have a martini to accompany said lunch?

Granted, the martinis tastes best and go down smooth on Wednesdays when they are a mere $3.99 each (any other night I believe cost up to $9.99) but I challenge you to score a seat on those nights. And should you luck out, I recommend the unfortunately named Tidy Bowl martini - it's the kind of martini children should drink were it not illegal.

But if you're like me, by that I mean a girly drink drunk, I also recommend trying ALL the martinis on their drink list.... just, you know, not in a row.

Every item on their lunch menu is of perfect size and flavour be it pasta, pizza and sammich. The decor is cozy for the small business luncheon crowd that wishes to avoid the Milestones and Jack Astor's of the neighbourhood. And as I mentioned before, martini mayhem is the name of the game on Wednesdays.

This place also has a quaint upstairs which you can book for private parties complete with its own bar. Perfect for a birthday party not intent on disturbing the locals."}
{"text":"Decent food for an okay price - enjoyed their Lucy's mac & cheese, which was very delicious but didn't have the panko crust advertised in the menu. Looked more like a pasta cabonara than a baked cheese dish, but still yummy. I went with a group and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal, especially the meatball marinara panini which won rave reviews from my friend - chewy baguette, chunky marinara sauce and moist meatballs."}
{"text":"It is pretty easy to call this place a no brainer pass after experiencing what they had to offer. Went in for a brunch and walked out underwhelmed. The waitress was just awful, never present, and I don't mean beside the table, I mean found at all. The order came correct but only after having to wave her down after waiting 30 minutes with the menu. I asked for coffee twice that never came. Then, after sitting there with dirty empty plates for 15 mins - I got an eye roll when asking if I could get the bill please. The food was nothing special but I can't say awful. I can say if you want something good to eat and would like to have a capable server bring it to you keep walking without saying hey to Lucy."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesy and meaty calzone baked in a super hot oven, $3.99 martinis on Wednesday nights, Czechvar beer and cool atmosphere make up Hey Lucy. Perfect place for that first date, after work drink or a bite before a show.  The prices are comparable to chains such as Jack Astor's but obviously much better food and drink.  Use the washroom before you go if you aren't very mobile as there are stairs down to the washrooms!"}
{"text":"Memorable service - it was memorably BAD.  Went here with a couple of girlfriends one evening and ordered food and drinks.   When one of them tried to order another drink, the male waiter said he would give her a drink but I was cut off because I had had enough.  I had had 2 drinks, my other two friends had 4+ drinks each and I had no intention of ordering another so I have no idea why he felt compelled to humiliate me in such an unnecessary and totally unfounded way . . . other than the fact that I am a visible minority and my other 2 friends weren't.  I hate to play the \"race card\" but I can't fathom what other reason there could be since I was not drunk while my other friends were tipsy.  I sent a letter chronicling my experience to the owner but received no reply.  They obviously don't care about their lousy service.  There are far too many places in the city to spend my money than having to be subjected to their abuse again.  WILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with family. We were seated immediately as it was not too busy. Our orders were taken but the food took almost an hour to arrive. The food wasn't too great and was not worth the wait. It was a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"I went to Hey Lucy on a date a couple weeks ago and it was pretty bad. We were just having drinks before heading to dinner and chose to sit at the bar. There was no bartender to be found. We waited for more than 10 minutes before anyone even appeared behind the bar, and were completely ignored for almost another 10 minutes before the bartender came to us and asked \"Did you want menus?\". They seemed to be really short staffed, but we were sitting at the bar for almost half an hour before getting a beer. We didn't do a second round."}
{"text":"Nice location, great and friendly service, good and very tasty food! (Mac & Cheese Pasta) at a valuable price! Would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and drinks with my parents and I was a bit disappointed to be honest. Don't get me wrong, the place is cute as hell and we had pretty good service but the food was definitely sub-par. 

I ordered the flatiron steak and goats cheese salad and asked for medium-rare, but when my dish arrived my steak was pretty much completely raw. C'mon guys! I asked the waitress to have it fixed and she was more than happy to help. Once I got my plate back, I tried the salad. Now, you probably shouldn't advertise a dish as \"flatiron steak and goats cheese salad\" when there is barely any goats cheese on the plate. I ain't kiddin' around here! There were 3 TINY pieces of goats cheese on the entire plate. I was bummed about that. 

Everybody else in my party was pretty satisfied with their experience but I was unimpressed with my food. Which sucks because I really wanted to like this place. Probably won't be back for food, but I'd give this place a second shot if it were just for drinks!"}
{"text":"Stuffy, narrow restaurant. Removed the yo adrien sandwich a few years back, which was a great dish. Have not had a good meal since. Poor service & pretentious server very off-putting. Not recommended. Better off somewhere else on the block."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The food was delicious and the service was great. It's an especially nice to go in the summer, as they've got a really nice rooftop patio."}
{"text":"If Lucy is on a plate and covered with strawberry compote, garnished with fresh fruits and taste like fresh egg bread french toast, I'd eat her for breakfast, lunch, dinner and do it again, and again and again. Yup it was yummy and sexy and just delicious.

I'm usually not a big fan of anything sweet for a meal. specially for brunch, but Hey Lucy's strawberry cheesecake french toast, definitely changed that. For $9.00, this meal, though didn't fill me up, satisfied me well.

The service was great, the kitchen staff and front of the house made sure we had an experience and not just a meal. I enjoyed the atmosphere, for being a lounge/martini place at night, definitely not bad as a restaurant during the day. I enjoyed looking at the wooden oven in the kitchen, I wanted to take it home actually and just stare at it while I enjoy a plate or two or three of strawberry cheesecake french toast. 

My friend had their Traditional brunch and he enjoyed. He did come back few days after and had their Fennel and Chili Shrimp for lunch, he didn't like it, said it was salty and just wasn't good. But then again, who would want pasta  if you can have strawberry cheesecake french toast!"}
{"text":"Got into Toronto late on a Wednesday and luckily came across this place - there weren't many places open serving dinner. 

Martinis are the Wednesday special and they're a good deal: 4.49CAD. They have a bunch of fruity, specialty ones, but the basic vodka or gin ones were included in the special too. 

We started with the phyllo-wrapped goat cheese salad. It was perfect for sharing and pretty tasty. We split the smoked bacon pizza: thick cut Canadian bacon, artichokes, roasted red peppers. 

Service was great: the waitress was a good mix of low key and attentive. 

I'd definitely suggest it for dinner or late night eats."}
{"text":"What a fun place with great food! Don't miss the Mac n Cheese balls which are fantastic, and we had them as part of the app platter which was a ton if food for the price. Great service."}
{"text":"They have an excellent $4 martini night with lots of variety! Godzilla is the best one in my opinion, and I tried at least 10 over time. It is very busy on that day though, so getting a seat was nearly impossible!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for dinner before a show, it is priced fairly for King West.  I was there last night with a couple friends and we ordered:

Fried Calamari - to share
Arrived at the table fresh and hot.  While it was tasty, the portion was very small, so it makes sharing a little awkward as you are keeping count of every piece you eat. A little steep for $11.

Seafood Linguine
Delicious.  I easily switched to a rose sauce and it arrived steaming hot and tasted very fresh.  The seafood was cooked well with good sized shrimp (only 3 of them sadly) but I would order again.

Bacon Carbonara
My friend had this and he was very impressed and wiped the plate clean.

My other friend opted for her own order of calamari (likely due to the tiny one we shared for appetizer haha) and a caprese salad. She likes small bites anyway so she was happy with her selection.

Deep fried cheesecake
Omg soo good

Lots of wine.  Too bad it wasn't $5 Thursday.  We'll have to pick a Thursday show next time :)"}
{"text":"Came in to Hey Lucy's for a quick bite to eat before heading over the movies. The nachos were very different from what I am used to. They were delicious! I just wish there was more cheese. We ordered some hot chocolate but it was probably a powder mix because it tasted dreadful! The ambiance was nice and the service was friendly. Took forever to get the bill though."}
{"text":"2 out of 5! Food is average! Recommend going here in the summer for drinks because of the open rooftop"}
{"text":"I've had very pleasant dining experiences at Hey Lucy on King, and was hoping that this location would deliver the same. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I have little to say on the food, which was average at best. 

Our group of five received little acknowledgement upon our arrival on Sunday evening, and service was disgracefully slow - we waited almost an hour before any food arrived at our table after ordering, without any notification or apology from our server. When I brought this to the attention of the waitstaff, I was given excuses (busy kitchen, different cooking times). We asked for bread for the table and the server was confused by our request and none arrived. 

While this may simply be symptomatic of it being Sunday evening service at a restaurant that clearly does its best business on Wednesdays, I was more disappointed at the way our concerns were handled by staff than by the slow service and mediocre food in itself. Likely will not be visiting again, though if I do I will not hesitate to choose the King St. location instead."}
{"text":"One star for the super comfy seats. That is all. We had the\" share plate\" which consists of a variety of freezer burned foods including the worst fried calamari I have ever choked down in my life, 2 frozen raviolis and 3 frozen, bland fried mac n cheese balls. The menu also states that it comes with several dips including Tzatziki; well I guess they ran out of tzatziki as the kitchen tried to pass off sour cream as tzatziki. The service was listless at best. Biggest waste of time and money ever. Just stay away from this dump."}
{"text":"Great little spot amongst shitty (Gabby's) and pretentious (Parlor) restaurants. They don't advertise it, but they have half price martini's before 5, so when we arrived at 4 we had to drink quick. I had 2 gin martini's and the Hey Lucy martini (lost a bet). I'm more traditional with my martini's but damn was the Hey Lucy good. But damn, the pizza was even better!"}
{"text":"Over the last few years Hey Lucy has become one of our \"go to\" patios in the summer for a long, relaxing lunch. It may be the only place in Toronto where the waitress knows my drink order without me having to say a word, although I have to admit that it's a simple order: gin martini with a twist.

I wouldn't consider myself a martini guy, but how can you go wrong with $4 martinis every day before 5pm (and all day Wednesday). Typically after a few lunchtime martinis I go back to the office thinking I'm in Mad Men and that I will bump into Roger Stirling in the elevator. Be careful, because when you actually sit down at your desk and realize it's not the 50s the rest of the day can be pretty disheartening.

As for food, make sure you try something that's cooked in their wood-burning oven...I don't think you'll be able to resist if you're seated on the patio because the chimney smoke lightly wafts over the patio as if you're sitting at a luxurious campground. I guess I should mention (if you haven't figured it out already) that the patio is up the stairs and at the back. Not much of a view because it's on the second floor, but it has a very comforting and cozy feel instead.

Back to the food, I suggest the Double Smoked Florentine calzone or the DIY pizza ($10 for a 2-topping pizza at lunch). As it says on the menu, the pizza is \"stretched thin to order and cooked in our hard-wood fired dome oven at about 700F\". Delish.

I feel as if I should mention the two small downsides, as well:

1) The portion sizes can be quite small if you're a big eater, although they're perfect for me.

2) The service can be very slow. This can also be looked on as a positive, because it doesn't have that rushed air that is common to most financial district establishments. Just don't expect to be back for that 1pm meeting if you leave at noon.

Overall Hey Lucy is highly recommended for a comfortable, laid back,  patio lunch on a sunny Friday. Any work that has been on your mind (or any problems whatsoever) will disappear faster than the $4 martinis!"}
{"text":"Ordered it through UberEATS. Got the chicken panini Caesar salad and fries. Enough food for two people. Was delicious. It will be on my favorites list through the delivery service. Because it's UberEATS it's never as hot as I'd like but that's certainly not the restaurant's fault. Will definitely go to the restaurant to eat!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a really solid meh. Nothing really bad about the experience, but nothing really good either. Friday night dinner for two with drinks come out to $47. The server was nice but over-attentive, checking in on us before we'd finished the first round and right about the same time we noticed that we were still waiting for our food orders. And then waiting. And then she checked the kitchen for us, and still more waiting.

The panini wasn't anything special and the Lucy Mac 'n Cheese (I know, I know, I just really love cheese) had potential, but fell short with really fatty bacon and one enormous chunk of sun-dried tomato melted into the mix of cheese (which is always yummy) and soggy noodles. The plating was terrible (not a big deal, but definitely added to the unimpressiveness) and the side of garlic bread (I think that's what it was supposed to be) tasted like dry carbon from over-grilling. 

Apparently the location is owned by Gabby's, which might explain why it tastes like pub-cooks attempting italian fare - because it is. I probably won't go back for dinner, but I might be willing to give brunch a chance."}
{"text":"I have only had the pleasure of coming here once and I look forward to the day I go back. To say the less this place is a good fall back. It can get crowded or so I'm told but I think it's worth the wait if you don't really have anywhere to go. 

I thought everything was reasonably priced for the service and food we got. Overall I liked it but then again it wasn't anything to go crazy over. If I'm out with friends and we just can't make up our minds where to go, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here for a quick lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We sat at a table in the back. The atmosphere is very comfortable with lovely murals on the interior walls. I could see this being a good casual first date spot.

We decided to split a lunch pizza ($9.99) which came with two toppings and a side of fries or salad. We opted for goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes as our toppings and a salad on the side. The crust was a classic thin variety, with generous, fresh toppings. Delicious. The salad was your run-of-the-mill balsamic and greens with cherry tomatoes and red onions. 

The service was efficient and friendly, the atmosphere lovely, and the food delicious. A great first impression, and I'll be heading back at some point."}
{"text":"So I waddled into Hey Lucy today with nothing but an empty stomach. I looked around and they told me to pick whatever seat I wanted and so I did, sat down ordered a beer, fried calamari and a roasted chicken calzone. Oh god the beer was an amazing Czech beer brought by Zeus himself striking down lightning to distill this magical fountain of liquid gold. The food came rather quick, the calamari was below tier, due to the fact I like my calamari crispy but they might as well be the grilled calamari with light breading, all well. However the calzone was amazing. As I cut into the calzone I felt like Moses splitting the sea. As I took my first bite I felt like a champion, a Spartan of men. I devoured it like a monster Hercules himself wouldn't have dared challenge. Got my bill and it came up to $35 not bad."}
{"text":"Your typical bar/restaurant, except $4 martinis all day wednesday. I only go for the cheap martinis, so I cannot comment on the food.

==========

EDIT: my friend says the chicken rose is pretty good"}
{"text":"The fix is in.... I understand how they can charge $3.99 for a Wednesday night martini - add water to your vodka. Tonight I sat at the bar (seating is hard to come by on Wed), drank 5 martinis in a little more than an hour and didn't eat dinner. This was supposed to be a total of 10oz of vodka. On drinks 3 and 4 I asked that the juices be omitted and on drink 5 I asked for straight polar ice vodka (their vodka of choice). I had a bit of a buzz, but had I done the same at Pravda I would have had to use the railing to walk down the steep stairs to the street. 

I would like to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. The straight vodka martini didn't really have much kick, nor did my belly get warm with alcoholic joy. So I'm fairly certain that dilution is occurring on Wednesday nights. 

Be forewarned of dilution Wednesdays. I didn't eat there because I assume they use MSG in their food to fool people like their $3.99 martini list."}
{"text":"Walk in hoping to have a quiet sit down drink with friends, only to be turned away because the bar was closing. Who the hell closes at 12:55 am on a Saturday on Bloor?!"}
{"text":"Can only comment on the breakfast menu as a group of us went for brunch here last week.  We had about 12-15 in our group and it was great.  Really good large breakfasts, great and fast service.  Nice interiour.  Bathrooms were a bit dumpy though. The only thing that annoyed me was that the place was full so the group had to split up."}
{"text":"Their pizza I'm sure is frozen. Yes they have a wood oven, but the pizza either comes frozen or they make and freeze. You know the taste; it's unmistakable.
The chicken parm was equally generic, seemingly no sauce to the pasta besides oil.
$50 badly spent."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave a hearty plate of pasta, this is my go-to-place.   The pizza is good too, but maybe just a little too much on the doughy side for my personal taste.  Overall the food is very solid though, the atmosphere is comfortable and fun, and the waitresses are all super sweet."}
{"text":"This place is ok, tried pizza here but not very memorable.  Not very busy in the afternoon, in fact, there were plenty of seats on a late Saturday afternoon.  The waitress seems confused at time.  Given the area has so many bar nearby, I probably wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place! 

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday night and their feature that day happened to be discounted martinis, score! 
 
We snagged a patio seat upstairs on top of the roof and it was packed! But I think it created a great social atmosphere and it felt so welcoming and lively. 

The staff were very friendly and efficient for the amount of people dining. We ordered an organic greens salad ($8.50) and a chicken & brie pizza ($16) to share. We also got a sextini and a lemon drop martini ($4.49/each) which weren't too strong and so refreshing!

The salad came well dressed in a balsamic vinaigrette and acted as a nice palette cleanser from our meat and cheese pizza. Honestly, the crust is what made the pizza so irresistible! It's thin and crunchy but fluffy and chewy all at the same time. The roasted garlic was fragrant and sweet and complemented the cheeses so well. Be sure to ask for some chili flakes too!

Overall, love the vibe of this restaurant because everyone seemed so laid back and were having a great time! Delicious pizza and cheap drinks too? I'm in!"}
{"text":"$4.50 Martini Wednesday - awesome!!! (although most of them were too sweet for my liking - however, the \"lychee\" and \"freedom 55\" were good enough to have 5 of :)

I was there with my gf for an after-work drink and we really enjoyed ourselves.  We got there pretty early (4:45pm) and were lucky enough to score a booth towards the back of the room - it's critical to get there early, as it gets packed! and a lot of the other tables suck.

We shared the antipasto platter - which was amazing! only $13 bucks with lots of variety (hummus, pita bread, olive paste, sauteed peppers and pickled onions.. not sure what else, but it was good!!) and enough food that we both felt satisfied.

cannot wait to return in the summer to check out the patio!!"}
{"text":"I visited Hey Lucy on Bloor for brunch recently and had a pretty decent time. We were told to seat ourselves, which we did, and our waitress came to greet us and take our orders as quickly as she could. Our food came exceptionally fast--I think around ten minutes after we ordered. I was super impressed by this! I had the veggie eggs Benedict, which was delicious; I really enjoyed the tri-coloured potoatoes! Coffee was good, too. 

The only downside to the experience was that the waitresses seemed understaffed and flustered. Though the restaurant was busy, but not overly so for a Sunday morning, it took us nearly half an hour to receive our bill after requesting it. It was a shame as put a damper on the end of an otherwise fantastic meal and great service. Our waitress was really sweet, though, so I can't fault her. We'll be back again as the food was great and we understand that staffing issues can definitely happen!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. 
The staff and semi open kitchen provide a great atmosphere for a night out, it is pretty clear that they have been trained well to provide timely but non intrusive service. The drinks menu is decent and although I didn't get a chance to sit out on the patio (cool night) I can imagine with the style of food and the beer menu it would be a pretty great way to spend an evening. 

The pizza was well baked with an evenly cooked crust that was just toasted enough to maintain a firm foundation but still chewy for some texture.

Weird placement of the vents makes it a bit drafty in the back, only noticeable if its a cool night though."}
{"text":"I ordered a classic chicken fettuccine Alfredo and instead I got a vusili pasta with a bland sauce and chicken. It was specifically noted in the menu that the chicken would be wood-fire baked and if it was, it was under-baked but still cooked. My friend got a simple margherita pizza that tasted like a frozen pizza. It was nothing like how a wood-fired pizza should taste like and it didn't even seem they made it correctly or even at all with a wood-fired oven. The sauce was a plain tomato sauce topped with cheese. No other spices were added! We were shocked at how poor the quality was, especially since their price range is around the same as Cafe Nervosa in Yorkville. We did not bother to complain even because we had waited for about an hour for our food already and we were starving. 

On top of that the waitress forgot our orders and apparently their system restarted so our orders were never put through. We got a simple sorry and she was gone from the table. She never refilled our water either within the two hours we were there. I don't know what was on her mind that day, but nothing from her attitude showed that she cared. I wondered what others would have done in my situation (i.e., would you have tipped? complained and asked for a free meal? etc.). 

This was not my first time here either. I have been here multiple times before over the past two years since I live around the corner but I was appalled and extremely disappointed at everything during this experience. I do not think I will be back here again. 

For a pizza of $12 and pasta of $15, none of it was worth it. 

Service: 1/5
Food: 1/5"}
{"text":"Tldr; cheap martinis, good service, bad food 

Went with two friends on wednesday for martini night! Although i didnt drink my friends enjoyed the martinis and they were super cheap! Also the waitress was nice, friendly and attentive. 

But the food was pretty bad... We ordered two pizzas and a pasta to share. The food was mehhhhhh at best. The chicken on the pizza and pasta was really dry and the pasta sauce tasted like it was out of a jar. We ordered a fried cheesecake with carmel sauce which was surprisingly tasty!"}
{"text":"Worst brunch ever.

I just read Abigail V.'s review and wondered if she had brunch at Hey Lucy's on the same day my friends and I were there.

Whether she did or not, even $4 martinis couldn't bring me back through Hey Lucy's doors."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy ... you have great food but the dining experience you are creating needs some help.  Take this all as constructive criticism as it would be great to get your service on par with the quality of food. First of all, give a guest a menu that doesn't have two missing pages.  Don't seat your guests in a table under a tree that needs pruning.  Don't get snarky when we ask to move seats because the branches are annoying.  Improve the speed of the delivery of food - we shouldn't have to finish a pitcher of beer before a pizza and a salad are delivered.  And finally, adjust your playlist and the volume.  This definite 35+ dining crowd didn't really appreciate the volume but more so we didn't need club dance tunes to enjoy our dinner.  If your trying to draw a crowd in from the street then point the speakers a different direction.  In the end, we enjoyed a delicious pizza and a fresh salad but all these other factors mentioned wouldn't have us running back for more.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, but the service was good.  As is the patio.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner before.  The food is great.  However, the service of a waitress was a total turn off.  A reservation for 6 was made.  However, there was a confusion or miscommunication of the time of the reservation.  People in the service industry should understand that it only takes one bad experience for a person to never return again.  Making a comment like \"Well, even if you're reservation is for 6:30 pm, you're still late anyway!\" when it's 6:40 pm.

Say what!?  You just lost a $400 worth of business and I'll never come back.  (Unless she's gone)"}
{"text":"Je n'y a pris qu'un verre, alors je ne peux vraiment pas évaluer ce lieu avec justesse. On dira un trois pour l'instant et on repassera pour le reste !"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for dinner.  The waitress was lovely (though we had to track her down for the bill after about an hour- but she left us be after dinner to chat, which is nice instead of being ushered through the door as soon as you are done), but the food was pretty blase.

My two friends got pasta dishes.  The mac 'n cheese was decent, but INSANELY greasy, even for mac 'n cheese.  The pasta primavera was okay, but nothing to write home about.   I got the oven roasted chicken.  And boy was it oven roasted.  I've never seen a deader chicken in my LIFE.  As soon as they brought it to the table, you could see how grossly dry it was - pieces were practically flaking off.  Eating it was much like chewing on a piece of leather.  The pasta under it wasn't bad, but it was really mishmash with chopped up snap peas and halved cherry tomatoes.  It tasted okay, but it looked a bit odd.

Really disappointed as I was excited to eat here.  I'm not a picky eater by any means, but it just wasn't great.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was my after-after hours bar after being on a bender for 4 days with Adam Sandler's cousin and some guy from the band INXS (they were on tour with that new singer I don't like). Needless to say we needed a change of pace from our wild time spent in the bathroom stalls of Maison Mercer!

We met a few more friends outside and headed in past the cramped patio to some tables which were conveniently right next to the kitchen AND bathroom. What a deal! No one could possibly see my chiseled jaw from here. Anyway our waitress kept talking about all the things she was allergic to, I ignored this and ordered my first half priced cocktail which was some fruity thing (like everything I drink). I also ordered a chicken panini, ironically. 

The first round of drinks came soon enough and were tasty enough. I downed it and immediately ordered another. This one was even fruitier. My agent kept skyping me so I let the waitress flirt with him while I ate my just-arrived panini. It was tasty enough but I wish I got the dipping sauce my friend got. Looked delicious. Anyway everything was pretty average and unexciting and the prices were a bit much for what you get. $14 for an okay panini isn't so hot. 

Our driver was waiting outside so I told the waitress to keep the tip and invest it in Zynga and snickered my way out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio made the evening. Got the florentine calzone; was good but a lot smaller than expected. Girlfriend got the chicken avocado pizza which was great"}
{"text":"I am only writing this review based in the martinis we devoured. We just wanted to have a drink. I ordered the cucumber & mint. Delicious!! It's made with gin instead of vodka. My friends also enjoyed every drink they had. Staff was friendly, drinks were good! What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"$4.99 Martinis on Wednesdays now. (disappointing) They use to be $3.99 AND taste better. WHAT HAPPENED?"}
{"text":"One of my gf's fav places (although she prefers the Bloor/Bathurst location) - drinks always excellent, love the fact they have Czechvar on draft (not a lot of places in Toronto serve that). Food is always great and I always have a great time when I'm there. Gf loves the martinis and has tried almost all of them on the list - and she swears they are some of the best...

Not 5 stars because it can get crowded fast (small place) and at times it doesn't feel that intimate with people chatting right next to you... menu is not that big and prices are not that low... unless you do their specials."}
{"text":"Great service. Simple pastas, pizzas and salads at reasonable prices. Try the kale salad! Friendly, attentive staff. Mixed drinks are great and reasonably priced. Beers on tap and in bottles. Patio at back. Seems to be busier than it used to be. TV screen to watch sports games and the occasional bachelor show."}
{"text":"The antipasto plate was excellent as an appetizer. There were piles of olives, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, balsamic-glazed onions, and garlic, but the pita bread it was served with was a bit over-charred.

The butternut squash ravioli sauce had a very heavy tomato sauce with tomato paste-like consistency and flavour. It didn't combine well with the goat cheese and spicy pecans. Because of this, the ravioli felt quite heavy and got boring after a few bites. 

Service was very mediocre. They don't have a great system for greeting people at the door and no one acknowledged us initially. We grabbed a booth and there was some delay in getting served. The waitress didn't use the corkscrew properly and fumbled with the bottle for a couple minutes at the table trying to get the cork out. We waited a fair bit of time to get our bill at the evening.

Overall, nothing to write home about. There are a lot of fun options nearby that I would consider before coming here."}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar salad. Wasn't too impressed. The lettuce hadn't been chopped and there was minimal dressing. It's hard to screw up making a caesar salad but this place pulled it off!   It also took 20 min for them to prepare this plate."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken and Brie pizza, and great service.
The toppings are inventive and tasty.
I did find the pizza just a little too thin in the center, and the salad was just that, a salad. 
But overall it's yummy and worth stopping in if you're on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Cool atmosphere, great service, cheap drinks and food! A must visit place."}
{"text":"All depends on your server. Pizza is good, nice and thin and tasty. Service was good with some servers but Feli*** thinks it is ok to tell you the tequila is 8 bucks then underpour you charge you 11 and say well it is close enough right? 
Wow!
Well my sub standard tip was close enough right? 
I like the place too bad one person can ruin it."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Cute atmosphere. Called to make reservations - only do 6pm and 8pm seats for reservations, but walk ins can be seated any time (which is kind of odd to me). Decent menu. Mostly fire grilled pizza and pastas. I got the chicken pizza and they gave me no problems/didn't charge me extra to substitute spinach for tomatoes. Service a little slow, but otherwise it was a nice, relaxing experience. Heat lamps on the outdoor patio, ambient lighting (expect it to get dark)."}
{"text":"It's not an awful place to go to, but I am not sure I'd go again.

The atmosphere is nice, albeit a bit loud.. The menu didn't really appeal to me (pasta, pizza, standard fare), but I went for the calzone, which ended up being overly cheesy inside and the chicken breast was pretty dry.

The 'housemade' sauce was freezing cold, and I am not sure it was meant to be a counterpoint against the hot, melty calzone, but it should have at least been room temperature, not out of the fridge and out of a jar.

Yes I said it. OUT OF THE JAR SAUCE.

The nicer cocktail drinks are $11 if you don't go on Wednesday night which immediately put me off.

Overall people seemed to like their food, but I can make most of the food better at home and I've had better."}
{"text":"I came here after a Blue Jays game about a month ago. We were really hungry (didn't wanna spend a fortune at the game) so we thought since we're already downtown, might as well find something walking distance to try. We did a quick search and found Hey Lucy! 

Didn't realize that it's a bit of a fancy place, it was a Wednesday night and mostly everyone in the restaurant was dressed to impress. And here we were, walking in coming straight from a Jays game with our hats and T's on, oh well ? it also threw me off a little when they asked for ID to enter. 

At first glance, it seemed like such a fancy restaurant...with fancy dressed people, fancy looking food on their tables and nothing really caught my eye on the menu. Wasn't really \"feeling\" the place..

Decided to go for the fried calamari and sausage supreme pizza. It was delish i totally judged the book by its cover on this one and I'm glad I was wrong! The calamari was lightly battered but still crunchy and flavourful! The crust and dough on the pizza was on point, and ingredients were fresh. Staff there were very friendly and we received great service."}
{"text":"Wow fantastic food and amazingggggg patio! It's so quaint and cozy. Must get the fried risotto balls... They was my faveeeeeee!"}
{"text":"Ordered a margherita pizza and it was DELICIOUS! Wood stove really brings out the authentic italian flavour. me likey! :D"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch to celebrate successes. Ideal for mid size party, and a variety for most people. The highlight of this restaurant is $5 Martini. Did I mention amazing, fruity , mouth dancing, affordable liquid gold for your tastebud ?

Oh, I did eat lunch. The salad was good. Rose penne chicken pasta was the table favourite.

Great place to go with chummy colleagues!"}
{"text":"If you love Pizza this is the place, its better than the King street location. The staff is friendly and the pizza chef Benno is wonderful, probably the best pizza chef in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars during the week, and two stars on the weekend. During the week, downtowners can get a wood-fired pizza and $4 martini on Wednesday night or a $5 glass of wine on a Thursday night. Pizza is good, fresh and filling (I've yet to find pizza that is inedible!). They have a range of martinis ranging from the sweet chocolaty type, tart jolly rancher type (yum!) or something a little more classic, and most come serve with a special candy in the bottom.  They also have a variety of beer on tap and in bottle. The thing that sets this place apart is teh dessert pizza - pizza dough, with chocolate sauce and gelato. It sounds like a kid's dessert but is very good - I highly recommend sharing. 

The exposed brick, chandelier and zebra print couches totally set the vibe for a fun girls' night out but there are often couples on dates or movie goers catching a drink before or after a film at the TIFF Lightbox across teh street.  And... in the summer they have a small patio in front on lively King St W and an upstairs patio at the back.  

On the weekend, this place changes and all of the things I like during the week seem cheesy so I don't go..."}
{"text":"Okay been lazy with my reviews lately but time to get yelping.

Went with a friend for drinks here after hearing about the $4 martinis.

The entrance is a very akward door, which is made more akward by the number of people waiting in line for a table. They do have an upstairs also but I think that is only for dining.

Since we were not there for food we quickly saw some people leave the bar area so we took up position there.

The layout of the place is narrow with more space towards the back where the kitchen and dining area is. This place must be popular as the queue was pretty long.

The drink selection is good, the martinis varied in taste and style however for me I could drink these in one gulp but took my time.

I like the atmosphere and vibe of the place, its very laid back but a great place to go and chat and catch up with friends. The service was good and quick.

We did order some calamari but yeah as mentioned below it was a real stingy portion.

Overall nothing really to seperate this place from any other after work bar but I did like the overal vibe of the place."}
{"text":"I went to Hey Lucy with my boyfriend for brunch.  We just randomly walked by, and looked inside, and saw people eating yummy-looking food, so decided to try it out.  It was OK.  I had eggs benedict, and I thought they were a bit watery, and the buttery sauce on top was a bit flavourless.  The potatoes were tri-colour, and these were DELICIOUS! The decor is pretty tacky, with animal print cushions.  Overall, I still enjoyed my meal, but I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"I had the margarita pizza - the barometer for any pizza. It was very good. Service was very good, but lacked personality, I assume she was very busy.  In the end she was very nice, but this was evident throughout the evening. The back patio was packed, but still intimate. Definately worth trying out."}
{"text":"After previously working near the Entertainment district for years I realized that I never explored many of the popular spots along King Street across from the TIFF building. I always assumed these spots were pretentious and likely pricey given their location.

Post 18 inning Jays game our group was searching for something small, uncrowded with good cocktails and good food (and a good patio could help too). As opposed to settling for something closer to the Rogers Centre (Skydome) we trekked up a few blocks and took in our options on King Street West. 

As the sun came out we realized a rooftop patio would be grand and just like that Hey Lucy's large advertisement out front for one such type of patio drew us in... and up!

It's by no means a large patio, more like a small wooden deck that now overlooks a deep hole in the ground where a high rise will soon stand, but with a surprising amount of shade provided by overhanging trees and still full sun in others, it was cozy and fit our purposes perfectly. 

I ordered my usual, an Old Fashioned, found it to be OK but not remarkable. I tend to like it with less ice (or large cubed ice) and less sweet (this had a fair amount of sugar in it). Shortly there after we decided to order a pizza for us to share and went with the sausage and pepperoni option off the menu. I'm usually very critical when it comes to 'za, call me a 'za aficionado or a 'za snob, but this 'ZA made the grade in my books. Good crust, fresh toppings, well cooked throughout, my only note would be that the sauce was a touch tart. 

Prices for both the cocktail and pizza were standard so my prejudice against King West Entertainment district spots was off. Overall this was a great spot, and somewhat of a hidden gem when it comes to patio's in the city. Worth checking out for sure!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch on the regular. The rosemary chicken panini with sweet potato fries is delicious. Coworkers of mine are always raving about the calzones and mac'n'cheese bites. Food and service are always good!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went here and got the mac and cheese balls, which were amazing! We then ordered two pizzas on our own, which were both fantastic. We wanted to get dessert but we were too full! Great place!"}
{"text":"This was our last minute walk in as we were too tired and starving and on busy Friday night we could just walk in to this place. We had Antipasto Platter which was OK the pita bread was very dry. For mains we had the pizza and calzone. Most of it was meh! nothing special. The house red was also mediocre at best. I wouldn't really recommend this place other than the service was OK and you are in need for a filler otherwise in this area you can do much better."}
{"text":"Unless you are desperate to get a seat indoors because you have a toddler or you are exhausted or not too particular, this place does not have good food and is better avoided if possible. To add insult to injury they were skimpy with the bad food and it was also lukewarm to barely cooked. It was not busy AT ALL inside so I could not see any reason why the food was undercooked. We at the table were fairly hungry and the only persons gobbling the food were the kids (one who likes deep-fried breading and icing and the other a growing teen). The music was nice, and there were a lot of seats, plus the washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and drinks last night, not knowing about their $3.99 martini special. The place was packed, but the hostess was really friendly and accommodating. 

The service was great, but I wasn't blown away by the food. It was perfectly good, but nothing memorable. Maybe I should have had the pizza? That is their speciality -- they have a special wood-burning pizza oven and everything, \"straight from Italy\" (to quote their menu) -- and my friend's pizza looked really good and loaded with toppings.

Their wine selection was surprisingly decent for this wine snob, and if I lived in the neighbourhood I could see myself dropping in for drinks."}
{"text":"Popped into Hey Lucy for a birthday drinks and dessert combination. The deep fried cheesecake was good, the dessert pizza should be skipped. Martinis were very sugary sweet. On Wednesday they are $3.99. Great deal. On any other night they are $8.99 and they are not worth that price.

Music was rocking."}
{"text":"Super average. I got brunch there, and nothing I ate was great but nothing was awful either. Coffee tasted like maple syrup. Middling service. 3 stars feels like the right rating for sure."}
{"text":"This place has a great location around king and john and an interesting inside layout. It's  main con in my book is that it can be quite pricey if your having a drink there. Their \"specials\" are also sill expensive. With that being said they have nice Martinis and cocktails on the menu for a night out and decent appys to choose from. Very convenient spot to hit up if on the entertainment district just duely note it's a small space so it could be a long wait."}
{"text":"Crowded and noisy but in a very good way! Great atmosphere and the food was very fresh, good and reasonable! Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"A pretty decent place on King's 'restaurant row'. The food was fairly priced, decently portioned and ready pretty quickly for the Saturday night we went. The staff were right on top of things and gave some helpful suggestions. 

The location is fantastic if you're heading to a TIFF film at the Lightbox across the street. It's a good, solid 4 star. Definitely a place I'd go to again."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time while on Bloor street and decided to pop in. Was very impressed with the food ( ordered the chicken club panini. bread was extremely crispy, chicken was moist and delicious, and the flavours were absolutely wonderful), the attentiveness of our waitress, and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. Returned later that night to make another purchase for a friend ( had spread the word ) and was greeted promptly. While they were busy the food was made in due time and just as wonderful as before. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came so my friend could have gluten free options and her meal looked good. My Rucola salad was flaccid overdressed greens over a dried out slightly burned chicken fillet. I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy is like most of the restaurants on that strip - underwhelming. But also like the other restaurants on that strip, they provide a decent meal that  student can afford and I was grateful for such things when I was living that life. Service was perfectly fine and these young women get bonus points from me for wearing midriff-bearing tops and short skirts in December in a restaurant that can't be bothered to keep the door closed. Shame on you, management."}
{"text":"The food on the brunch menu is affordable but almost all mediocre. The servers are friendly but seem to make mistakes regularly. The positives about this place are that there's usually space, even at peak brunch hours, and they play good background music (a lot of motown and oldies). That's about it."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Had an awesome roof top patio and amazing food. And the white sangria - AMAZING. 

Spent about 3 hours here one night when in town for work and I couldn't have been more pleased. From
the grilled artichoke appetizer to the chocolate cake - it was all so delicious. 

And I'll have to mention it again - the sangria is killer. I could have easily had a carafe to myself, but I shared anyhow. 

Nice staff, friendly, and clean. Great place on King street."}
{"text":"I really like hey Lucy. I went the other night for my friends bday and it was 5 dollar wine night.. What a great deal! Our server was wonderful and conversational and we were Able  to snag a spot on side patio which was nice. There interior design is \"interesting\", not sure why there so into the zebra print but to each their own. I always have a nice evening here.. Thy have great daily deals and nice service! Who can complain?"}
{"text":"My favourite hangout spot , great food and atmosphere try and sit upstairs more space"}
{"text":"Last night we visited Hey Lucy for late night drinks and a bite to eat. 

The restaurant has a really nice ambiance and friendly employees. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks. I was really excited to see kombucha on the menu, since I have never seen it for sale at a bar before. (Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage that becomes carbonated as it ferments. It's really bubbly and tastes delicious). I ordered both the orange oolong flavour and the lemon ginger. I found the orange oolong to be a little less plain compared to the lemon ginger one. 

My friend order a cherry bourbon martini and she absolutely loved it. In fact, she enjoyed it so much, she ended up ordering three more. And yes, she took a taxi home. Hehe. We are always safe. :)

I ordered the grilled calamari and it was really good. The calamari was served with artichokes, which made this appetizer extra special. I love artichokes so it was a treat to get to enjoy this. 

My friend ordered a sandwich and fries and she really enjoyed her dish. Both of us had not been to Hey Lucy in about ten years and we are glad we stopped in for our late night snack. It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Positive: Wed night Martini special( lets be honest, that's why people come to this place). Service is great as well. 

Negative: The food..Go to Pizza Pizza down the street, you will be happier."}
{"text":"I definitely like the patio here. Although I'm not sure why the fountain is never on. We came for brunch but missed it at 2 pm on the nose. The regular menu is carb heavy. About the only thing that is not pizza, pasta or panzerotti is the grilled calamari or the steak or fish. I rarely order steak or fish because for the price, I'm usually happier cooking both at home. I dove into the carb pool and had the Proscuitto Pizza. It was really tasty, but the crust was too thick for my liking. My friend's nachos were massive, but only the top layer of fried flour tortillas are covered in toppings. Our two guys had the Pepperoni Panzerotti. The tomato sauce was nice, but I didn't bother with the filling since I was already getting full.

They made a great Bloody Caesar.

The cocktail list is big and some of them looked great, albeit very sweet. I think I like this place better for drinks and a shared nibble than a place to spend money on dinner. 

Service was good."}
{"text":"I cannot understand how this place is rated over a 3. I suppose if you going just for drinks it isn't terrible but their menu selection and food quality is sub par! The only reason we dined here was because it was a late Sunday night and everywhere else was closed. Lucky suckers; that's how they got us. No one could decide what to order because everything seemed so mediocre and overpriced, and unfortunately we weren't proved wrong with the quality. 
I will give credit where credit is due and call out their cool rooftop patio and friendly service. Do yourself a favour though and if considering dining, walk, cab or jump on transit to a different restaurant that offers a true culinary experience."}
{"text":"Hey lucy is a great place to enjoy italian cuisine. I sat outside patio during the summer time and its always live and a great location. I had a ceasar salad to start & mac n cheese & calamari, it was delicius. For main, I had a delicious featured pasta dish with a pizza. I had great memories being there since I had a lot of drinks off the cocktail list, even one of my drinks had gummy bears at the bottom, who wouldn't get trashed? ;)"}
{"text":"Best calzone I've ever had! The food here is always really tasty, and as previously stated, the calzones are amazing. Washed it down with a pitcher of sangria, which is not on the menu, but they will do for you (20 bucks for a pitcher.) The rooftop patio is also nice and shady, if a bit crowded when busy, due to lack of space. The only negative I can think of is the booths are a bit uncomfortable, but the food is worth it!

Food ordered: pepperoni and mozzarella calzone, antipasto platter."}
{"text":"Great lunch on the roof top patio.  Service was good.  Had the Tuscan ham and cheese with fries.  Loved the corse mustard they used.  Wife had the chicken primavera pasta and they were nice enough to even top it off with some goat cheese for her. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I went to Hey Lucy for the first time today for lunch.

I liked the look and feel for the place (hip and modern...with a little rocker kind of feeling). The place seemed clean and the service was pretty quick. We got our orders set within a couple of minutes.

I ordered the Grilled Flatiron Steak and Cheese Wrap with a house salad on the side. It tasted really healthy because of the spinach, red onion and red peppers. All in all, it tasted pretty good, but i will likely have something difference next time.

The prices were fairly cheap as well considering the location ($13 after tax).

I recommend anyone to go here for a quick,tasty and fairly cheap lunch."}
{"text":"This review is only for their drinks.. me and the Mrs. were just bar hopping, when we came across this \"rooftop\" bar. While the setup was really nice, our expectations were probably too high from Toronto ;-) (as compared to NYC rooftops).

We were just returning from a heavy dinner at Earl's on King Street, and when we came to their rooftop, the smell of the Indian Dhaba restaurant was just so strong, that we couldn't really enjoy our drinks! None the less, it's an a pretty decent setup; really friendly, welcoming and helpful servers..

Am sure, if we were empty stomach, this would've gotten a 5 star... 3 for Lucy's and 2 for the Indian Dhaba next door!

Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I honestly am shocked by the negative reviews some people are getting. I come to Hey Lucy's quite often (and I haven't moved to the area yet), and every time I come it's amazing. The food is amazing - pizza, seafood pasta dishes, you name it, the drinks are on point - Vitamin C, Gummy Bear drinks etc, it's all around good. I hope the negative reviews don't discourage people from giving it a chance. The servers are nice, the atmosphere is really chill and relaxing, an all around good time."}
{"text":"Service takes a bit long- we were done our pints before our food came (they also do not serve pitchers). We both got the club panini. It was alright, served with a stingy portion of fries and salad. Would not recommend to a friend..."}
{"text":"4$ Martinis on Wednesdays are great - really good selection of martinis too! 

Food is mediocre at best, patio is a bit ghetto and could use some upgrading."}
{"text":"Food here is terrible. We have been a few times because we want so badly to like it-- it is right next door and so convenient. The service has been awful the last couple times and this time was really a deal breaker in terms of the brunch food. The coffee is 2.50 and we agreed we'd both rather drink instant. It is terrible. Asked for butter and got some weird thing of lard. Food was lukewarm (like the last time we came) and the place wasn't even busy. Breakfast potatoes are flavorless and taste freezer burned. If I were paying a few bucks for a diner breakfast, I wouldn't complain but this place is not super cheap and they clearly take no pride in their food. As another customer mentioned, they cut corners and you can tell. The food quality and presentation is really bad.  Go to By The Way Cafe down the street. Food there is still not great but much better than Hey Lucy."}
{"text":"A reasonable place to hang out and the first south locale on the King Street West strip, just west of John Street. It has two patios, the smaller front one where everyone wants to be in due to excellent people watching prospects, the cool street vibe and the less know back one on the 2nd floor. Which is where you get shoved in once the place gets packed. 

Don't get me wrong, this place gets packed due to being on the strip, it's smallish dimensions and trendy exposed brick decour. For example seating at the front is alright, with it's retro zebra patterns back splash and couches and a good simile of Italian food. Seating near the bar and you are either tight against the bar itself or against the wall due to the passing wait-staff so if you are more than 2 then forget it. So basically if you come in larger groups, then it can be a quite tricky and I would just avoid this place altogether.  Best for groups of 3-4.

Service can be touch and go. I have had respectable service, however I have known large groups that had a nightmare being seated due to bad staff planning and on top of that, rude behaviour. Also the food is nothing special, although the Pizzas are not okay. 

Now the reason why this locale gets 4 stars instead of 3 is their mighty famous Martini Nights on Wednesday. Personally I have been going to them for more than 10 years. After work, maybe for a date or  just to chill. 

Over a decade ago (God I feel old saying that), almost no one cared about Martinis --or Sushi for that matter, so Hey Lucy was in a class of it's own and there weren't that many Martini places. [RIP Babylon].

So cheap  $3.99 --limited selection-- Martinis where unheard off, although back then most martini's where in the $7 range rather than today's $11. Thus Wednesdays this places gets ridiculously packed, you would have to be around 7:00pm+ to guarantee seating.  
Personally, if I need some cheap Martini's however, I tend to the go the Annex location than this one. It's not only newer (just over a year old at time of writing) and has a nicer, more modern and less retro-vibe as well. Mind you, I generally only go for the Martinis, not the food. When I have Italian I expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I have visited Hey Lucy a number of times over the years, both locations actually. Never had food here since to be honest, I am not inspired to purchase food here. Nothing really exciting on the menu unless you happen to be starving and I mean, dying of starvation. 

They have the usual semi-Italian menu with Pizzas and the like. They have a nice patio which I have been there many times both at Hey Lucy and when this place was Mel's, the smoked meat breakfast joint a few years back. 

The main draw used to be the $3 dollar martini's on Wednesday, and man, what a draw that was, they would get silly crowded! Now sadly, over the years the martini's seem to be getting smaller, in fairness, they were always smaller while the price has been creeping upwards. First to $3.49, then to $4 and now to $4.50. Ahem, excuse me, $4.49.

Yes, martini's were not in vogue 12 years ago so the average martini at one point was about $7.50-$9.00, however after shows like Sex and the City, they are now cool and hip and the price of martini's is $10-$14 at most places. But at $4.49 (aka $4.50) they really do not really seem to be such a bargain anymore since as I said, they are smaller martinis than their regular, more expensive counterparts.

I had my issues with service once or twice, specially over the the booking of a table for my party because one person had not arrived although 11 of us were and an issue another time with being charged incorrectly which ended with me having to refuse to pay for that item, as I had not ordered it. Specially after I had specifically requesting separate cheques at the beginning. Not what I would call total deal breakers but enough to make me hesitate to come back. 

Unfortunately the one thing that made this place a must-go on Wednesdays is no longer as effective, since if you really want to go out for a drink for example, just a bit east, at Insomnia, a much better lounge (sans patio), you can have a cold pint of good beer on Wednesdays for $4, plus the food is way better. 

All in all, the place is decent but being in the Annex, being decent is not enough when there are better choices minutes away."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a saturday morning and ordered the Veggie Benny and a fruit bowl. The food was great, the service was okay, but the seating was a little cramped- was seated in the back at a two person table. Intimate but not that nice. I think cocktails started around $4 so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Nachos, meh. Fantastic service! Nice place in Toronto near the theatre district. Good martinis and cold beer. Washrooms are in the basement."}
{"text":"I still don't get why this place is always packed. Well, I guess I do, must be the patio, but that's the only really great thing about it. 
The kids menu is cheap and big and yummy but the actual menu is pretty mediocre and over-priced, the service, because it is so packed, is so ridiculously slow and it's very dim inside. 
The patio is lovely and I have heard they have happy hours every evening for martinis which I'll check out one day, but as a restaurant I was less than satisfied."}
{"text":"went here with few girlfriends for drinks.

it's a very cozy cafe, with quiet music, very friendly staff and apparently some great drinks offers on selected days (martinis on wed for $4 or so and there was something else but I don't remember now) 
Sangrila special offer on one of the nights didn't impress us though - $16 for 1/2L... 

I like the ambiance of the place nonetheless. The snacks they provide are yummy and light. Not sure about real food but the dessert pizza looked good by the glimpses of it that I had from the neighborer table.

Would love to try deepfried cheesecake that noone wanted to share with me so I had to skip it.

but I definitely like this place)"}
{"text":"This place is so reminiscent of a New York joint that I was having deja vu. The brick wall and the narrowness of the bar make me feel like I'm in a nice bar in Brooklyn. There is more space in the back by the wood burning oven but I actually liked sitting right next to the bar on the tables next to the brick. You can see where the mortar has crumbled away in the brick wall and where they've stuck a few wood chips to keep out the draft. 

Charming. The rustic outer surface is decked with various signs of Harley Davidson and Moosehead fame but still they have this almost posh vibe from hanging chandeliers and the beer tap backlight with several shiny gold tiles.

The mixed drinks are delicious and unique. The \"Hey Lucy\" specifically. I've never had alcohol soaked gummy bears before but OMG they're the most amazing things ever. Something about leaving those gummy bears in the bottom of your glass until the end makes the flavor just pop in your mouth. I'm tempted to try it at home. Very.

The food was also excellent. We had sweet potato fries which were served with some sort of aoli type sauce. The Grilled vegetable panini is delicious and I've never seen so many options to eat goat cheese (my obsession as per cheeses currently). The quatro formigiani? is a great flavorful pasta although its very heavy and thick with cream sauce.

If I could I'd go back here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great specials and the patio is sick!!!

I think they had one of the best and most unique take on nacho's over here. The nacho was baked and fluffy and tasted like a cross of a cracker and chip. It was baked nice and hot and was definitely a treat. Usually a big meat eater but we decided to accommodate our vegetarian friend. We ordered the buttersquash ravioli. 

WOW...one of the best tasting pasta dishes I have tried in a long time. Must try!

$5 martini's at night. This place is amazing. Really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I'm going to tell you all the story of How I Met Hey Lucy's.

I remember going to Hey Lucy's when I first moved to Toronto  - we were ignored, the food was slow, and I left the restaurant unimpressed.  

Fast-forward a year when I went there for a Friday night dinner with the girls - I went early because I knew it would be packed.  There was a 30 min wait, so I put my name on the waiting list and told the nice man (who turned out to be the new owner) that I was just going to hang out at the Second Cup next door.

So now I'm at the Second Cup, waiting for my friends to arrive, when the owner came INTO THE SECOND CUP TO TELL ME THAT HE HAD A TABLE READY FOR ME.  On top of that, he let me bring in my hot chocolate, but ask if I can just put it in one of their mugs (sure!).  

At the restaurant, it felt as if we had our own private server with the amount of attention she was giving us, and I was so impressed that I booked my Champagne Birthday party in their upstairs lounge, where they created a special menu (yum!), closed it off for my party (at no charge) and we had our own bartender for the night.  It was so much fun!

I like this place - it has a cool vibe and the martini's are yummy. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Checking out McBeth at TIFF.  Thought we would try this place for a change and its right across from TIFF - bonus!

Alot of the reviews seem to be based on the martinis.  Let's try to rate the food!

Ordered organic greens to start and the prosciutto pizza and seafood fettuccini for mains.

Salad was a beautifully presented and perfectly dressed fresh greens that was delicious and refreshing.

Mains were delish.  Al dente pasta with tomato sauce and fresh perfectly cooked seafood.  Definitely a great place to come for dinner before or after a show.

Service was warm and friendly which is a pleasant surprise downtown TO."}
{"text":"This place was originally supposed to just be a waiting place to have a drink, until a different restaurant opened next door.. However, we were incredibly hungry and couldn't wait any longer. I am so happy we did! The Steak Frites was so good- I'm normally used to some tiny little skirt steak, but this one was big and perfectly cooked. The beer choices were decent, and everything that came out at tables around us looked amazing! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for a drink and a snack after our show and we were so beyond disappointed with the service! The waiter completely forgot about us and every time had a question, he would direct his answers towards by boyfriend. Lol My boyfriend asked for another beer and 20 minutes passed before he realized he had forgotten my boyfriend's beer. During that time, we observed him serving one of the other staff (could have been a manager) who asked for a drink as she sat down with a calculator. You can remember to serve her, but you can't remember a simply re-order of a pint? Service is clearly not on anyone's list at this place."}
{"text":"Been there few times and each time i was satisfied either for their pizza or their pasta.

It would have been 5 stars but their cocktail are not their strengths so just be aware ;)

Always had a great service from the staff too."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio and I would love to have a good pizza place in the area, but Hey Lucy just does not get the job done.

The food simply isn't that good and is not worth it. 

While Famoso is not my favourite, I would go there for pizza any day over Hey Lucy.

If you are only going out for drinks, this might be an option on their patio."}
{"text":"I can only say wonderful things about this place all around after my experience there last night. 

1) they had fantastic wine specials. 
2) my 2 girls had a couple of the salads and loved them. I had the butternut squash ravioli accompanied by a small salad and it was great - the sauce was delish, I believe there was walnuts in the sauce which was a pleasant, crunchy surprise and the noodles were perfectly cooked
3) the white sangria was really tasty - especially on the warm day on the patio
4) you seat yourself at this place and the patio fills up pretty quickly but it's a great little spot in the Annex

After dinner, I had walked out, driven all the way home only to realize then I had forgotten my new Burberry jacket was left on the back of the chair. I called, and they had already stored it behind the bar for me. 

I couldn't have been more pleased with the service!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here on a Friday night. It wasn't planned, we just happened to be walking down the street and the frontage caught my eye.  The first thing you notice about this place is that the owners have sunk some serious money into it; the finishings are excellent, the tin ceiling is a nice touch and the wood burning oven is most impressive. I thought sinking this kind of money into a start-up operation was quite bold but when I Yelp!ed it on my on BB I found out there is another location on King. The Annex seems like a strange location for this type of restaurant but it seems to be doing well.

The menu was reasonably priced for this type of operation. The $8.99 Martinis are a bit much, but on Wednesdays they are $3.99. The menu offered simple selections (pizza, salad, chicken, etc. etc.) but our choices were done well - chicken stuff with veggies and Alfredo linguine for her ($16) and a Pepperoni Calzone for me ($10). She also very much enjoyed the Jolly Rancher Martini (the gummie bears at the bottom of the glass were a nice touch).

The service was friendly, attentive and unpretentious. A rarity in Toronto so it is entirely worth noting.

My only complaint would be that the pop comes in plastic cups, felt a little like Pizza Hut for a moment, ha ha.

Two entrees, a martin and a soda was $43 tax in + tip. Not cheap for dinner in the Annex but for a proper sit down restaurant and a nice, new (CLEAN!!) atmosphere I was happy."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, the night of Nuit Blanche and I enjoyed it. I had a sandwich with some sweet potato fries on the side which didn't disappoint.

Service was good with our waitress being super nice and friendly. That helped when the meal my friend got (stuffed chicken) hadn't been stuffed. She got some options on how they were willing to make up for it and ended up getting half the cost of her meal being taken off.

The environment inside was very comfortable and pretty intimate. If I was looking to have a nice dinner with friends in the Annex I would likely to recommend going to Hey Lucy again."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. If I pay $5 for added chicken to a sandwich I wouldn't expect 2 slices of lunch meat to be thrown on the sandwich for it. Drinks were pretty good and the prices were even better. Make sure servers are aware of what's going on will also be a suggestion to move you to a better rating."}
{"text":"Check this place out on Wednesdays for $4 martinis. I've had pizza from here twice. The first time, I was majorly impressed and loved my pizza. The second time, I was pretty underwhelmed and couldn't tell if I just dreamed up the delicious pizza from the first visit. A third visit is in order to really put the pizza to the test."}
{"text":"Great restaurant located in the Annex area, along Bloor Street. WIth an inviting decor, sizeable indoor space as well as an outdoor patio, this is a great place to get a bite to eat for lunch or dinner. With a wood oven, this eatery specializes in thin crust pizzas, pastas, and salads.  Wait staff is great and the presence of a full service bar makes it an ideal location for a weekend end meal.  Side salad can be ordered for an extra $3 if ordering a pizza, which is great for those watching their diet or wanting a small appetizer before the main course."}
{"text":"Great spot. Pizza & calzone were fantastic. Server was very friendly, even looked at getting us a recipe for their spicy oil. Price point very reasonable. Great date spot. Lucy's could get it."}
{"text":"Quick bite with my daughter.

Kid's pizza is as large as the adults.

Pizza was good .. 

Service was OK. ..never came by for water or drink refill...

Would try again..."}
{"text":"The meatball panini which was alright. Certainly not spectacular.  Menu was rather boring. Service was polite but the food was a bit slow and it wasn't even busy. Very bustling area of restaurant row with lots of other options. I would try the others before returning here unless the menu gets a revamp."}
{"text":"This place was alright, nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed. A kinda cool place for friends to chat over sharing plates and cheap wine. The service was god awful! They forgot a persons main entree but we didn't say anything cause the person no longer wanted it. Our food took over an hour to arrive and waiting for a refill on a glass of wine took over 25 mins AND the place was not even that busy. The food itself was affordable and okay, but again, nothing crazy delicious. Would I go back? Not to this location. The king street resto is much better, I think!"}
{"text":"$3.99 Wednesday all day Martini's! hard to really beat that. The thin crust pizza was quite good, prepared quickly and had just the right sauce to cheese to topping ratio. 
Gets busy on Wednesday's but if you got a smaller group getting a table should enot be a problem, more than 4 may require a lengthy wait or a sit at the bar (which offers tThe full menu).
So how is a 3.99 martini? I am no expert, a beer drinker really, but there is quite a selection and they are not too watered down. 
Watch out for the yummy gummy bears in the Hey Lucy martini, and if you didn't get them or they skimmed out on the lichi, make sure to point that out (at the bar you should always get them but they have tried to skim out at the tables)

Happy drinking..."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy is just on the end of a barrage of tourist-trap restaurants on King West, designed to lure in unsuspecting visitors and force them to empty their wallets for pretty abysmal food and overpriced drinks. 

That being said, Hey Lucy! does have some good to offer. They have cheap martini's every wednesday ($5 each) and a pretty great list of spirited concoctions (Green Apple is my go-to). The restaurant itself is pretty small and the prices are kind of high, but the food isn't awful (at least in comparison to some other places on this strip). I love the Ya Old Goat Pizza (goat cheese, spinach and sundried tomatoes). The ceasar salad is OK but my brother ordered the curry once and it was barely luke warm. I find the food, like the service, is pretty hit or miss. 

Definitely go here for some martini's on hump day, but find another place for dinner (and trust me, there are many!)"}
{"text":"Went there because my friend bragged about the nachos and boy was she right. I like my nachos a tad greasy and with meat. Nachos here had no meat and all fress topping, were very tasty and didn't gave that overstuffed feeling afterward. Also tried the bruschetta, yummmmy.

I'll definatly be back."}
{"text":"so my friend and i were starving!! so we popped in and to my surpride the food came out fast.  what an easy transaction...i know that sounds stra ge to day but sometimes restaurants when they are busy on the weekend u feel like ur waiting forever for the food to come out.  service was straight forward friendly. 
food was okay.  i ordered the seafood penne.  it was good but its bot like i was in awe or anything probably could have made it myelf.  could have used some more of a gourmet touch something unique to accentuate and justify ppl coming back.
otherwise decent."}
{"text":"Nice bar with very good service.  Food is okay and needs work, not bad beer selection.  I would go back next time in town."}
{"text":"I brought some friends from Ottawa here last night for dinner. 
I love King Street and will make any excuse to go! 

Being a Saturday night with nice weather, I anticipated a long wait. In order to avoid this, I decided to make a reservation. You can do it easily on-line and the Manager will promptly respond to your requests. I made many, many, many changes and each time the Manager was quite accommodating. 

The location is great and gives out-of-towners a good impression of Toronto. The proximity to cafes and lounges for after dinner adds to this place. We went to the TIFF Lightbox for coffee and treats after our dinner. 

I found the food to be pretty good as did my Dining Companions. Portions were generous and when we left we were all quite full. Pricing is pretty reasonable too. 

Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food, but came here for after dinner drinks and dessert.

Love the decor of the place. Dark, chic, mysterious. I must add that the bar stools with cow spots were super comfortable. 

The martinis were delicious. They're $11, but on Wednesday's they're $3.99! I know when I'll be back. Once finished, my friend and I ordered the dessert pizza. I highly recommend! It's made in their pizza oven and has strawberries on it, drizzled with chocolate and a scoop of ice cream on it.

I'm intrigued by what their menu is like... I'll have to come back."}
{"text":"I was here with a small group on a Friday night, around 7-8pm. The biggest surprise was how dead the place was. I assumed it would be filled with after-workers looking for a place to unwind with a few drinks, but that wasn't the case.  But anyway, onto the review...

The place itself has a nice cozy atmosphere, and the upstairs indoor bar and patio looks like it would be comparable if it were open (which is wasn't)

The service was decent, out waitress was very helpful and friendly.

The food we had was ass. I had a chicken panini. It was dry and bland. My wife had a marinara pizza, again nothing special to report back.  So if you're looking for a place to drink that happens to have food then \"Hey Lucy's\" might be the place for you. If you want real food with a side of booze, try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall!

My friends and I met up for drinks one day at this restaurant after hearing good things about this place from other people.

First of all, Hey Lucy has an incredible rooftop patio that I recommend others to check out. Although it's small in size, it's got a very relaxed and comfortable vibe to it that many patrons are drawn to. Whether you are with the company of your friends or on a romantic date for two, this spot is suitable for all sorts of dining scenarios.

I ordered a few martinis because of their martini special ($4 martinis before 5PM) which ended up being very tasty. My recommended favourite is the jolly rancher martini! The chocolate martini was too sweet.

For food, I ordered the sharing platter which consisted of pita bread & dipping sauce, calamari, and deep fried macaroni balls. The calamari was typical fried and battered calamari that you could get at any other pub down the street - nothing really special there. The deep fried macaroni balls could have been cheesier and saltier. Otherwise it just tasted like boiled pasta in a deep fried battered ball. I suppose if I ordered a real main course my food experience may have been different but for now it was just average.

The service was pretty great. Our waitress took good care of us and was very friendly, offering drink suggestions and refills throughout the night. 

The one thing I did not like was the long trek down to the basement where the  washroom facilities were located. It is a battle to get down there during their busy nights! Otherwise, everything else was good.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for those seeking a bar/restaurant to hang out and enjoy a couple of drinks (specifically martinis before 5pm)!"}
{"text":"The rooftop patio was cramped, an employee was on the back steps smoking and having a loud conversation on her phone, and once the sun went down we could hardly see our food due to poor lighting. 

Had the crispy ravioli to start: pretty dry even with the red sauce for dipping. Hate to say i've had better a big chain restaurants that don't even focus on Italian food. 
Chicken alfredo: there wasn't a whole lot of chicken in this dish, the sauce was pretty oily. Not horrible, but definately ask for Parmesan and lots of pepper. The grilled bread it came with was the best part, sadly.  
Classic pizza: this was the best out of the three, still not something I would think twice about. 

The service was pretty good, the girls were very friendly and happy to answer questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy is in the strip of restaurants on King West, it literally is one restaurant after another.  Competition is so tough, there's hostesses standing outside vying for your attention and business. Hey Lucy is near the Princess of Wales theatre as well as the Skydome, and CN Tower.  So it's a pretty busy area. 

I went yesterday (Friday night) for a chillaxing dinner.  Compared to some of the other restaurants in the area, Hey Lucy is pretty laid back. It's not too expensive either.  There's a patio in the front (very tiny) and an upstairs patio as well (we didn't head up).  The downstairs is tiny, we sat sorta in the restaurant , but half in and half out (the store front is completely open).  

There's no hostess to greet you, so you kind of have to find a seat and sit yourself.  Our waiter, first impression, meano. Once we got talking to him, he turned out to be super nice and helpful. The menu is so extensive, we were having a hard time picking out what to eat. I was torn between the pizza nachos (they look really really good). ghnocci, or pizza.Unfortunately they ran out of ghnocci, so I got the pizza (it seems this place specializes in pizza).

My other two compadres got pizza as well. A meathead one (all meat) and Tijuana classic. The Tijuana classic was interesting because it was a salad ontop of a pizza. It sounds weird, I know, but it was really good! I got the cheeseless garden. Not bad, but next time I think I'll order the Tijuana one. 

The only negative was their debit/credit card machine wasn't working, and they didn't mention this to us beforehand.  We all did not have enough money (who carries cash anymore), so we were stuck. Fortunately one of my friends remembered he had \"emergency\" money in his wallet. A crispy $100 bill.. So we were saveddddddd!"}
{"text":"I honestly keep on coming back to this place! The staff are lovely and I love the atmosphere inside the restaurant. Food is reasonable prices, and I always come with friends. The food and service are great, and I would suggest the outdoor seating, it's great and you get the view of the cn tower"}
{"text":"Martini Wednesday? Yes please! However, using the cheapest vodka you can buy (Polar Ice I think?). Good if you want some creative martini drinks, but very blah if you actually, genuinely like martini's. 

The food is pretty good, I really do love the pizza and pasta and it's great for date night with the girls. Dishes are very easy to share, and they are quite tasty! But also, mediocre for the price. 

Service is always really good, someone is always willing to help you if need be. I really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Overpriced generic Italian food is putting it lightly.  

I was more or less interested to go in because of the name and was superseded that the decor was so adorable with all the zebra print and all.  

Paid $14.00 for a plate of pasta and a pile of cheese that they whipped up so quickly after the starter was served.  Didn't even look like they mixed it..  it's piled it on top like who cares.  

My boyfriend for the rose chicken of some sort and that was OK but again a pile of tomato sauce and cream of some sort with no imagination or regard for aesthetic value whatsoever.  

I was going to save the other half of my overpriced pasta and cheese if are not throw out because it cost so much.. but they did that for me! 

Waitress came to the table to tell me that she placed it down and someone from the staff must have thrown it away! 

1 starter, 2 drinks, and 2 dinners came up to around $60... minus the $14 they deducted for throwing out my meal it came up to like $52.  A price too high for a piles of spaghetti they probably sourced from Walmart.. might as well stay at home."}
{"text":"It was average in my opinion as we had a late dinner coming from another place for drinks. I ordered the rose chicken fusilli while others had other food items like apps and mains. Nothing out of this world as we were seated upstairs with quick service. It was not a memorable experience and we headed elsewhere for more drinks after finishing dinner."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with very cozy and warm atmosphere in a busy downtown neighbourhoud. We came in for drinks and ordered a pizza and a cold platter to share, both were great. Affordable prices too... Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Overdue review alert! we went here when they first opened up back a month and half or so ago. Discovered stiff martini's, really good pizza's, and what is likely Cabbagetowns nicest patio.
Welcome to Cabbagetown, Lucy!"}
{"text":"This place is very average (can you hear the disappointment in my statement)

I went here on a Wednesday, it was packed and very lively. A young professional crowd. Turns out Wed are 'martini night'. I had a Hey Lucy martini, it was really sweet. Like a child's martini (except children dont drink so thats not a good example) with gummy bears in it. My friend had something with lychee in it, it was even sweeter!

I know Martini's can be liquid desserts on their own, but there was no creativity to what they made. Just tasted like...a lot of grenadine.

ok, moving on to the food. We had a platter with fried calamari (good but chewy), cheese stuffed ravioli (suprisingly good), hummus (average) and brushetta (good). That was followed by the olive pizza. I love kalamata olives so was excited to try this pizza. But it was very average tasting, not bad, not good (ie. Terroni's make's good pizza!).

Overall this was an ok dining experience. It was super loud, I felt like I was in a bar shouting conversation with my friend all night.

To me, Hey Lucy is a dressed up Jack Astor's. The price of the meal was fair, service was fast, and it was a fun place to hang out.

Personally, I dont think I will return, there's many other places in Toronto to spend your $ on way tastier food (as I'm learning from yelp!)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in the area.  Great vibe, and absolutely everything on the menu that I've tried has been excellent.  Not just good - but really outstanding.  

Not sure this should be billed \"Italian\" - they have wood fired pizza and calzone, but the steak salad, veggie wrap and starters are great choices.

Great martinis, and Czechvar on tap!"}
{"text":"What can possibly be wrong with a place that has $4.49 martini nights, and $5 wine nights?  Well, nothing of course!

Decided to hit this place up on a Thursday night for a few bevies and some nibbles.  We ordered the wood oven fired garlic bread with cheese, and some grilled calamari.  YUM!  The garlic bread could have used more garlic, but we both loved the grilled calamari...it was perfectly cooked, and was served with spinach, artichokes, cherry tomatoes and olives.  It was flavourful and just enough for both of us.  

Now, the highlight of our visit was the $5 glasses of wine...hell yeah!  

Will I return, you betcha...next time I'm aiming to try out the $4.49 martinis!  Boom!"}
{"text":"Very relaxed place, patio is on top of the building, similar to adjacent restaurants and bars. The patio itself is pretty quite and well lit, with pendent lights with wires all over the patio. 

Menu is not extensive, mainly Italians such as pizza, pasta and panini. We had the grilled calamari which is a bit under-seasoned. The antipasto is OK, the best dish was the wood fired oven pizza, which is done to perfection. 

Drink list is kind fun, mainly serving different variations of Martinis, I had the classic with which is good. My wife had the mango tango which she likes too, but a tad too sweet for me. I didn't see any list for beer, which I assume they have a few, but was not the main theme of the place."}
{"text":"It wasn't awful it just wasn't anywhere that I would go again. I got the Agnolotti chips with a caesar salad. The 'chips' were but hardly even warm. The caesar had long full leaves so it was hard to eat but it was ok. The dressing didn't really cover the entire thing. The latte wasn't hot. meh."}
{"text":"I think of Hey Lucy as a King Street staple, as it's been there forever and you are always guaranteed good, not exceptional, drinks and food. They still have their martini special on Wednesday's. Though they are all quiet sweet, it's good fun to sit and have a few with friends and  appetizers. My personal favourites are the Lychee and the Sextini (and yes! I've tried them all....).

The food is good, standard pub fare consisting of pizzas, salads, calamari and the like. The rooftops patio is also a must in the summer."}
{"text":"Chicken/garlic pizza was amaze!!!!!!

And please indulge and get the antipasto platter... absolutely fresh and delicious and amazing. Mind-blowing!"}
{"text":"This place gets one star because I couldn't give them a ZERO star. We brought a group of 7 here and everyone had a terrible experience. The food was subpar barely edible and WAY overpriced save your money and go to the Thai spot around the corner called Pai it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Hey Lucy!
How're you doing?
You good?

But kind of funny?

Hey Lucy!
Good black & white bites?
Good ice cream?
Good caramel apple pie?
Good bruschetta?
Good drinks?
Good vodka tonic?

Mmm."}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout. Got a margherita pizza and a chicken-and-brie one for me and lady friend. Both totally passable, not too greasy. Was ready on time and no hassle paying or anything, prices reasonable enough. Briefly saw the inside and it looked fine - someplace I'd have no problem eating, even if not anything super special."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. We ordered paninis. Waiter could not be found after getting drinks. After placing our order we waited 45 mins. She forgot to place the order and lied that the kitchen was busy. Once we got our food, it was sloppy, tasteless, and very poor quality. Two bites in: hair. Waiter couldnt be found. Tracked her down, and she didnt care at all. Felt like it was our fault for being there. So, an hour wait for two bites of a hairy sandwich. 

Do not come here. Do not pass go. Turn around. Avoid this place. Starving is a more pleasant alternative. Seriously, never go to Hey Lucy. It was the worst service I've ever had in any industry. Please, have some self respect. Awful service, terrible food. I'd rather support Rob Ford than this joint.

In one word: no."}
{"text":"(Annex.Bloor) Had great meal at this place, early Friday evening.  Food, service and staff were excellent.  Boyfriend had steak & fries and I had a steak salad, both were wonderful.  Would recommend and will visit again.  Only one minor quibble, for such a great place - paper napkins?  Really?"}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Calamari and the Chicken Primavera, loved them both. Cocktail menu and drink menus had a good selection, but not as many options for non-alcoholic beverages as I would have liked. Nevertheless, their Cherry Coke was delicious. Very friendly and accommodating staff, and although a small error was made with a order they were very quick to correct it! All-in-all, my experience at Hello Lucy was positive . I would recommend it to anyone looking to experience an evening out on King"}
{"text":"Very nice service, beautiful place, brunch was alright, big portions but ok flavor. Pizza was pricey and very little meat. It might be good for drinks, but I know I can get better brunch in some other places in the neighbourhood. Definitely not coming back here for brunch."}
{"text":"Went there cause we're looking for drinks after dinner, looks like a nice patio, it was a really nice day and we needed patio.

The patio, it is nice. Though they have windows that open out but don't fold to be flesh with the wall, so it sticks out horiozontally with the wall and thus creates a barrier between people who sit on either side of this window. I guess the window definitely is a barrier for sound, but who wants the talk blocked off?

The other thing is they got this small speaker off to the end that for it's size really produces a lot of sound. We weren't next to it at least 10ft away and I could hardly hear the people sitting at other side of a round table that speaker was so loud.

Drinks menu, you got your standard Keith's/Coors like options (basically basic and just above basic options) which I guess is a personal preference.

They have this really nice pizza oven that is eye appealing. We already ate and ordered a dessert pizza. So here's the deal, pizza has dough and is usually round, sometimes rectangle. This pizza, they basically plotted pitas that was once round and cut them up, reverses each piece so now the pointy end sticks out to make it look like a flower. Then put some chocolate and ice cream on top. it didn't seem like this pita was made/heated up in this nice fancy oven which was kind of the appeal.

I did not realize there were multiple locations of this place. I guess not bad to grab a quick drink while watching the game inside."}
{"text":"Came here maybe a month ago with a close friend to have some food and drinks on the patio. The servers were great and the atmosphere was really nice, I really enjoyed their back patio. It seems that the uniform for the servers is just all black - however they want to do it - and I love that they encourage their staff to rick their own styles. I'm pretty sure there was a hostess that was wearing a black tutu, super cute! The only thing I didn't love is that I ordered a mild caesar and it was still pretty spicy - but I'm a baby with spice, so it may have just been them using something that Wasn't 'Original Mott's Clamato.' Thank you for the lovely evening!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the smell from outside is intoxicating and the restaurant itself is pretty.
Otherwise, I can't decide if the service or food was worse. 
Server took forever to seat us, offer a beverage, bring us our beverage, take our order and bring us our food. 
No, it wasn't the cooks' fault. It's a somewhat open concept restaurant and if we peep over, we can see exactly what they're doing. The cook was working hard. The server was on her phone in a corner for almost the whole time we were there. 
Also, no it wasn't busy at all. We came in for lunch on a Tuesday. There were only 2 other people inside. 
Maybe the pizza was good but I wouldn't know since I saw it being finished and helplessly watched it cool off for a good 20 minutes before the server looked up from her phone to notice our food was ready. 
Even though the cook worked hard, I didn't get as good of a look as I wanted so I have a sneaky suspicion that all he really did was grab some frozen pizza.. because it literally just tasted like he took a frozen pizza and tossed it in the wood burning oven.. then let it cool until it's almost cold again to serve it. 
I live really close by and I smell this amazing pizza smell from there all the time. Too bad it doesn't live up to the scent."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the experience we had at Hey Lucy last week.

The mac and cheese has always been my go-to, so I decided to try two new things: pear/goat cheese salad with chicken and the antipasto platter.

1) The pear in the salad was rock hard
2) The candied nuts were missing
3) The chicken was so dry it was inedible
4) The tapenade on the antipasto platter tasted rancid - so bad that I felt sick to my stomach

I asked my friends to try everything to see if I was having an off night, but they confirmed: dry chicken and expired tapenade.

I started to explain the salad issues to the waitress and before I could finish, she was gone.

We requested the bill - after being ignored for about 15 minutes - and our waitress asked if we'd like the tapas platter wrapped up. I said no and just pointed out casually that  something was off with the tapenade. I tried to laugh it off a bit, fully realizing how ridiculous I sounded at this point. She said nothing and took the plate away.

When she came back with the Visa machine, she said that it was an olive tapenade (which I knew, given that I ordered it) and that it's supposed to taste \"pickly\". Regardless, they removed the dish from the bill.

I hadn't expected the platter to be comped since I'd picked at other items on the plate. (The salad, on the other hand, was a no-brainer). Either way, the tapenade didn't taste pickly - it tasted like it had gone bad.

With so much restaurant competition in this area, customer service is kind of key. So while I appreciate being comped for the food, a simple apology would have gone a lot further.

It was the apathy - not the food - that led to our decision to not return."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend on a Thursday night and have nothing but great things to say about this place!

The service was excellent- our server was friendly, fun and knowledgeable about the menu. 

The food was to die for- We ordered the fried ravioli with dipping sauce- divine! I would even order it as an entree when I go back. I had the vegetarian wood fired pizza (pesto/tomato sauce, olices, red peppers, spinach and mozzarella, and my friend had the olive pizza. Both were delicious, with thin crispy crusts and fresh, ample toppings (though I liked mine better!)  We also enjoyed the martinis....perhaps a little too much....

Next time we will save room for dessert! We'll be back to take advantage of martini nights on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Came here the other night (I'm behind on the yelping), it was a bit cold (so no patio action for us).  The drink menu is pretty robust.  I had the jolly rancher martini, which pretty well put me into a sugar coma - not only was it sweet, but also garnished with gummy bears (which inspired me to finish the whole drink).

The bar is long and narrow, people were eating, but we had just some from dinner, so were just here for drinks.  The servers are nice, and it was a low-key kind of place ~ actually not bad for a first date (just saying)

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but have been avoiding pastas here in fear that they aren't good. They have Italian food which tastes freshly made so although not authentic it is at least still tasty. Cocktails are not that great but Wednesday they have the cheapest girly drinks in the city so a good spot for a bite to eat and to start off a night on the town. Good ambience and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Oh dear, last brunch in TO and we wound up here because the other place, Insomnia, was a long wait. The coffee was barely drinkable. My eggs over easy were not easy but over cooked. My companion was baffled when someone ordered eggs Benedict and they asked how he wanted them hard, medium or soft. (This happened to us before in Toronto why???) People, there is only one correct way to poach eggs, c'mon!! The portions were paltry (2 blueberries a half a strawberry and a slice of orange do NOT make a fruit garnish) AND....worst of all they charge extra for coffee for brunch!!!!!!!!!!! What the??? Terrible. Were it not for the lovely waitress this place would have gotten 1 star."}
{"text":"Food was ok... People seemed friendly...  Patio was nice... Perfect during the afternoon, right amount of sun..."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday for lunch with my father. We ordered a salad and pizza. Asking for no black pepper on the pizza - it came speckled with it. Immediately the manager came and replaced the pizza and was beyond accommodating. Her attitude was delightful and honest which is so rare to see in restaurants now a days. Our server came back with the second pizza and it was marvelous. The manager had omitted the pizza from the bill which was beyond generous. Small acts like this creates long lasting customers and we will be back for sure. 

Coming from years in the service industry I know first hand that even if there is a discrepancy with the food, it's the service that turns it around. Service was outstanding from both manager and server this afternoon. Thank you both."}
{"text":"First time there the other day with a friend. We started on the roof top patio which was nice, would have been better if it didn't start raining! The waitress was friendly. But she was a bit pushy by frequently asking us if we needed more drinks. (Though there wasn't really anyone else there because it was 2:30 in the afternoon.) 

4$ martinis were great! They had a nice selection. The Jolly Rancher was a fave because of the gummy bears in the bottom of the glass.

The food was good. The calzone I got had twice smoked bacon and it was extremely delicious.

At the end of our meal there was a bit of a long wait for the bill (which made no sense seeing as it was pretty much empty!)"}
{"text":"We were hungry after many delays getting to Toronto.  This place was 2 blocks from our hotel.  We dined on the outdoor patio which is nice and secluded (feels like dining in your back yard). We had the pizza lunch special.  Personal pizza with 2 toppings and a side for $13.99.  Nice thin crust pizza with a cold beer perfect for a lunch. It was the best meal, we had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I didn't hate this place as much as other reviewers...? I wouldn't say that their food was iconic, but it wasn't bad, either. There were a lot of options (like, a lot) on Bloor St, but my friend and I decided to come here because the menu had a number of options. We were seated outside, which was really nice. Our waitress was a tad slow, but she was incredibly pleasant. I got a pasta dish that was good, and it came with a large piece of garlic bread that made me really happy.

My favorite part about this place, though, was their drinks, specifically their martinis! Mine came with gummy bears in the bottom, and my friend and I down about 4-5 between the two of us. It made for a delicious addition to the meal.

If you're going to come here, I would suggest coming for their drink specials! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Came to Hey Lucy for my friend's birthday. 
My friend and I established that this place is good for a date where you're JUST getting to know the person because it is LOUD here; the awkward silences you might have will be - well, less awkward hahaha

WOOD FIRED ROSEMARY CHICKEN PANINI (3/5)
(roast chicken, balsamic roasted onion, basil pesto & tomato) 
The kale salad that I ordered as the side was really good. The panini was good but could be better if they marinated the chicken slices more. I would've liked it better if there was more sauce.

Service was great but we didn't know there was a plating fee for birthday cakes until the bill came (be waaarned!)."}
{"text":"Had the Lucy's panini, which was perfect. Hot, tasty and delicious. My friend got a pizza, which was also perfect. Nice, friendly servers and the back patio is cozy, with lights, a running fountain, and a friendly ambience."}
{"text":"This location is right in the heart of downtown - close to the theatre, symphony, TIFF building and a bunch of other things.  It's a great place to start off with dinner or a bite to eat after an event.  

While this place is quite small, it can accommodate big groups on the second floor. On the second floor they also have a cute little hidden patio.

The food is pretty good, though there is nothing really amazing about it.  People say the wood fired pizza is to die for, but to be honest, I have had better."}
{"text":"Honestly it's a Shame to call this a restaurant I have no clue how this guys ended up occupying a good spot in the annex and do nothing abut it left over Staff that can't get a job anywhere else very messed up kitchen really really bad but that's what happens when there's no owner around ...!!!"}
{"text":"Good steak and fries for 23$ tried the pizza too which is pretty awesome but too small for me haha"}
{"text":"Good service and food.  Lots of martinis to choose from.  Street patio is right in the action and the rooftop patio is shady and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday - the hottest day of the century - something like 40+ with humidex - and the inside temperature was the same as the outside. I just about perished! The food and service were very good, but either there was no AC or it could not keep up with the heat and wood burning pizza oven they had going. I inquired with the server and she said that the AC is in fact on but it's a particularly hot day and the oven also contributed to the stifling temperature in the restaurant. Strangely, a short while after my speaking to the server, it started cooling down in there...hmmmm, a mystery to me. The restaurant was empty, thus, my theory is that they turned down/off the AC to save energy and money. Whatever the case may have been, unless you're into sauna-type eating, avoid this place on hot days."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with a party of about 7-8. Asked the waitress for a double Cosmo -- \"we don't do that here, there's already 2 ounces in them\" shes says. So I order a regular. What she proceeds to bring me was a Martini glass, half full, which tasted like juice. I couldn't even taste the alcohol and Martini's are usually so strong. It was my first drink of the night too, so it's not like I was already wasted and couldn't tell the difference. 

My friend ordered a Samuel Adams pint and it was served to her with 1/4th foam at the top (see pic). How is that acceptable?

And then, right before we left, we all did a shot of our poison of choice, and I swear my vodka shot was watered down. Another person in the group got a lemon drop and commented that his shot tasted watered down too. Wtf?! I've never experienced that in a bar/restaurant in my life. A martini, pint and shot would usually leave me feeling pretty good but I barely had a buzz going. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Attractive area with a beautiful atmosphere, that is live on nights and weekends of course. I went to drink just a little bit here with my gf and her group. The Martini's here were dirt cheap because we were there on a special Wednesday Happy Hour or something like that. The place is somewhat small downstairs but there's an outside lounge upstairs that is considerably enjoyable. If anything this place reminds me of a French Quarters building. It seems cozy, and small downstairs with dim lighting. The bathrooms are in the basement and just know that the seating can get limited, even at the open bar."}
{"text":"I think the biggest thing with this place is knowing it serves more than just \"cafe\" stuff. 

I wanted to give this a 3.5 stars but have to reflect this as a 3.0. 

Listen, nothing super spectacular about this place but it is a nice surprise with a decent menu of Italian classics and snacks. Is it a place for a full dinner, not really. It has a lot of sandwiches, paninis, wood fire pizzas and some appetizers, so the best I'd describe the menu is very Gastropub like.

They have a decent local and popular wine selection, the bottles are a bit pricey at about 3x LCBO pricing, but their \"house\" wines are Peller and are $18 for the Half Litres which is a good buy to get 4 glasses worth. 

It's in a classic narrow King St W style set-up with an upper floor for parties. Feels like a warm cafe, lots of age to the building and suroundings but nice and welcoming. The food has again as I mentioned lots of familiar fare to dine on. 

I ended up getting a half litre of wine and a Sharing Platter which had calamari, deep fried mac and cheese, a few dips and hummus. Tasty, and hit the spot. Just missing the game on TV to be honest.

Not a bad spot and in a pinch would love to pop in again maybe after a Blue Jays game or something."}
{"text":"Wednesdays were my favourite night! Lots of martinis to choose from for a great price... lychee one was yummy!"}
{"text":"Hey Lucy has two things going for it- reasonably good service and long lines out the door at Insomnia down the street, some of whom don't want to wait an hour for a table.

The French toast at Hey Lucy was not particularly good. It was actually not worth ordering. In addition to it, I paid 4-5$ extra for three greasy pieces of bacon that were not the size of one normal piece of bacon. The coffee was at least hot, and my server was good with bringing refills. 

I would write more, yet the place inspires so little enthusiasm or emotion of any kind that it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy,

Your patio is pretty nice - but holy crap - your beer selection is horrible.  I guess maybe I shouldn't criticize you since I think you're trying to be a cocktail bar... at least, that's what I *think* you're trying to do.

But Coors Light, Moosehead and Czechvar on tap.  BLECH.  I don't remember see a bar so lop-sided - even the daintiest of wine/cocktail bars I frequented in Vancouver would at least have two or three tasty brews available.

Step your beer game up, Lucy.  You have a nice patio and I hate seeing it go to waste.

Yours,
Johnson"}
{"text":"Hey Lucy is one of the many choices along the restaurant strip opposite the TIFF Lightbox. Apparently they are known for their calzones, which are freshly made and stuffed full with your choice of fillings. It is really filling, and comes to the table straight out of the oven. So good.  If you want a lighter option, the pear and goat cheese salad is delicious and probably beat out the calzone as the star of the night."}
{"text":"As an addition to restaurant row it stands out. The margarita pizza in Fettuccine Alfredo are delicious portions are enough to satisfy without being overwhelming.

The rooftop deck was a great time on a cool July evening. Our server was attentive without being too invasive."}
{"text":"Come here for a glass of Chardonnay but I don't think that theiR Ontario and California Chardonnay were good. The services was good. The washroom is horrible!"}
{"text":"I had walked by here numerous times in the past couple of years and had meant to go in and give it a try - especially its famous Wednesday Martini specials!  As expected, it was crowded and definitely busy when I finally got to go on a cold, Wednesday evening - looking for a drink to warm me up!  The service wasn't the best, our server couldn't have any less time for us.  Understandable, I guess we weren't going to be big spenders.

They didn't have their famous chocolate martini... okay, disappointing - a big reason why I decided to go.

Had one drink, and was debating about having a second one.  That decision was made for me when the server very promptly gave us our bill... okay, no second drink then!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Hey Lucy's on Friday night. We walked in at about 8pm and were quickly seated. We ordered only bruschetta. It was alright. I typically don't like bruschetta was my friend was raving about it. The bread was nice and crisp, not soggy at all. I feel like there could have been more goat cheese. 

Again, I don't really like bruschetta but my friend thought it was fantastic. The service was quick for a Friday night."}
{"text":"A quick update of my favorite bar on Wednesdays. I tried the Opal (martini) my last time here (a few days ago), and I stuck to drinking 4 more of those. Yes, it's just that good. 

Also tried some appetizers and a slice from 4 different pizzas for dinner. I strongly suggest calamari for the appetizer; it is delish! And the pizzas are fantastic. Their Steak pizza is the best I've eaten in a long time!!"}
{"text":"I went to the King Street location. The place has a bit of a confusing layout but some nice rustic decor.  I tried their stone baked salami pizza which was delicious! My girl tried the baked calamari which was well seasoned and also delicious. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place for some affordable and delicious Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Here's my review:

Food 3.5/5.
Pizza arrived burnt so -1 for that. -.5 for the taste.  I wasn't too hungry and didn't want to deal with the waitress to send it back (more on her in a bit).  The chef seemed hard at work so i'll give this a decent score.

Waitress - Awful/10.

It doesn't take much to get a tip out of me for serving. It's a tough job but honestly this person should find a new profession if she hates her job that much.  She set the mood to i'm having a bad day and it's going to show it in my work immediately.

Highlights:
Rushed our drink orders and never returned for other people.  She actually rudely walked away while we said we needed a few minutes.
Overheard her talk to other patrons saying \"she doesn't have time right now and she's busy\".  She could have said just a moment etc.  
Checked up on us once to try to save face for a tip.

Overall, I'd probably go to the other locations and avoid this one.  I'm not sure if it's a staffing issue or that service is just generally bad here."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Location: 4/5

This restaurant has been one of my favourites in the Entertainment District for years now! I come here knowing I can get tasty food for an affordable price. Lunch menu items are usually under $10 and dinner options on average range from $12-18. They have a great variety of foods and my favourites are their pastas and wood fired pizzas. My top recommendations are their Hey Lucy's mac and cheese, wonderfully indulgent without being too heavy, and their classic spaghetti and meatballs featuring the perfect balance of tomato tanginess and peppered spice. 

The space itself is narrow and dimly lit. My favourite part though, is the rooftop patio area that opens during the summer. Overall, this place is great for a quick lunch date, or an end-of-the-workweek dinner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"6 of us shared 3 pizzas and 3 salads and we had pizza to spare.   Pizza was really good, esp the one with articokes.  Pear salad was also very good - could take or leave the phyllo pastry the goat cheese is wrapped in.  Overall good value and really tasty. Family friendly - good for kids."}
{"text":"This is the definition of \"meh\". You know when you go out and you regret having spent the time and money? That will happen to you, for days, if you hit up Hey Lucy. I can't understand how this place survives with other great pizza in the neighbourhood (famoso, pizzaiolo). Skip it."}
{"text":"$5 martinis on Wednesdays!! 

This is my go to place for drinks on Wednesdays. Their martinis are so good. My favourite is the Godzilla, I get it each time. It comes with a whole lychee, so bomb. Foodwise, I've tried their apps and pastas which are subpar. Their pizzas are pretty good though. My favourite is the bacon artichoke pizza, they really layered on the toppings for this one. 

Note that it get quite busy here on Wednesdays so there might be a wait and you may get stuck with a tiny table that's just inches away from the table beside you."}
{"text":"Great place to grab brunch when you're hungover. Good prices. However, my \"classic Benedict\" was overcooked - the egg yolk was hard and a bit dry.. Was hoping for a runny yolk."}
{"text":"Was served by a new bar tender leah, excellent service. Such a fun time, really great expierence.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Everyone in the place has a smile on their face! Terrific service, good food, reasonable value. I look forward to returning. Waitress had a great sense of humor without being intrusive. LOVED the Mac n' Cheese, very different from others.
Drinks are a bit spendy, but they don't skimp on the alcohol, either.
Seriously, the service is unusual for Toronto. No pissy faces, they seem to be genuinely happy you stopped in, and they actually talk to you beyond \"whaddaya want\" and the \"thank you\" isn't flung over a shoulder as they practically run away (like most GTA restaurants)."}
{"text":"I went to Hey Lucy for their Wednesday night $4.49 martini special. I don't recommend the Lemon Drop, but the Sextini was delicious, with the Mango Tango as a close second.  

Hey Lucy had a relaxed atmosphere and the server was there when we needed her, but otherwise left us alone.

Will definitely go again to try the food as everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing."}
{"text":"Rooftop patio during the summer is a must. Sharing platter (bruschetta, hummus, calamari, cheese hors d'oeuvres) was amazing. Veggie pizza was AIGHT... I'm not a big fan of the super salty tomato sauce that drenched the pizza. Service was kinda slow, but our waitress was a cool chick who reminded me of a less-druggieish Courtney Love."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the $4.50 martinis Wednesdays! The largest selection of the most delightful martinis I have seen! I tried the special martini for the evening, I think it was called the Lotus flower martini but not completely sure! Also tried the jolly rancher martini! Enjoyed both of them! 

Why am I giving it only 3 stars ? 
I ordered the chicken primavera, and I have had some outstanding pasta primaveras before and this one was bland compared to those. However the calamari appetizer and the antipasta platter were pretty good.  

Will I go back? 
Absolutely ! The $4.50 martinis are way to good to pass up !"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years, and what's not to like? $5 cocktails on Wednesdays and $5 wine of Thursdays!!! Amen! The cowboy drink is one of my favourite cocktails here! Love the candy inside the drink. Service is always attentive and food is good."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was OK, with all the choice of good Italian restaurants in the city I would try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I always have the \"gluten free' crust... i have not problem with gluten, but i just prefer it because its so thin.... pretty good prices for food - but i do find that the calzone is a pretty small serving.  Also, the price of soda pop is steep for the small glass you get.  However, love the pizza"}
{"text":"Went last night with a friend and we enjoyed our time there;

FOOD 4/5 

We shared the grilled calamari appetizer served with black olives, artichokes and cherry tomatoes. (5/5). Nice presentation, the calamari was perfectly cooked and all the ingredients worked well together. 

My partner had the chicken and sausage penne (4/5). Very generous portion, tasty and it had a nice kick. 

I had the Sausage Supreme pizza (3/5) and I have to say I was expecting a little better. It lacked spices, I had to sprinkle a lot of pepper flakes on it. The crust was well cooked and perfectly thin. 

SERVICE (4/5) 

Even though there was few patrons, we had to wait a little too long when we arrived before being greeted and seated. Past that point, the two waitresses were very friendly, helpful in explaining the menu and making suggestions. We were served in a timely manner and they checked on us often."}
{"text":"I honestly feel that this location of Hey Lucy is underrated.  They have a great ambiance, and even have a patio in the back.  They have a variety of beers on tap and their pizza is delicious.  I've been here several times and have stayed in the dining room and the patio.  Their service and pub food is acceptable, and they have some great martini deals on Wednesdays.

I came after 9pm last Friday and was a bit disappointed that the kitchen had closed and only pizza and panzerottis were being served.  I hear brunch at Hey Lucy is quite good from a friend and would be willing to try it."}
{"text":"Band was great and so was the food! Pretty dark inside  but I don't mind it. And our server was SUPER friendly and attentive. When I walked up I asked the host for a table near the band and she sat us directly across from them lol. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Ok. Stumbled across this place for dinner and drinks with a friend. Had the pizza which was GREAT and had a few martinis (between the two of us the Forever 55 was great but the Jolly Rancher was gross)
Then we turned and there was a MOUSE on my jacket
A cute little grey mouse mind you, but a mouse nonetheless. I was so grossed out we just left
They did however take 50% off our pizZas for it
But still
Ill never go back
(Too bad too, the pizza was yummy)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, reasonable prices and really good atmosphere. The sausage, bacon, pepperoni and mushroom pizza was excellent! And the calzone I had another time was great. I love their marinara, I'll definitely keep going here."}
{"text":"So, every time I go into a restaurant because it looks ok despite Yelp reviews, the Yelp reviews are always right. And they are definitely right this time - do not eat here.

Service was fine - but the food was at very best mediocre and most wasn't even that. We had a huge antipasto platter which had too much of each vegetable, but was poorly seasoned and unevenly cooked. 

The pizza crust was very poor and the sauce was both overly herby and yet tasteless.y daughter had the spaghetti and meatballs - meatballs had a weird texture and too much filler.

There are so many other options in this neighbourhood - don't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"Tried this out before a show across the street, mainly because of proximity. 

The staff were super friendly, and the menu had enough variety for our group. It's a nice space, and prices aren't at all terrible for King West at all. They also take reservations (even on show nights) which is nice. 

Unfortunately the food is a bit meh. For example, the \"mac and cheese\" is essentially penne with plain cream sauce and a wad of cheese in the middle, and the calzone was pretty bland, undercooked and doughy. Just sadly underwhelming. May try it again at some stage, as I hear good things about the drink specials :)"}
{"text":"I came here in March 2014 after seeing a play and I absolutely adored this place. 

From their brick walls to the zebra striped booths to the burning firewood smell. Everything about this place was fantastic. The service was incredible and the food was ah-mazing. 

I came at just the right time, happy hour of course! I ordered the banana martini (whatever that may be called) and ended up drinking 2 or 3 because they were that good. Half way during the 2nd martini the food came out. I ordered the poached pear and goat cheese salad with added chicken. Aside from a homemade Caesar salad, I don't think I've ever been this happy about a salad before. The goat cheese was wrapped in a phyllo pastry which is perfect. I've never had pear on a salad before and it just changed my world in an instant. I was a firm believer that fruit shouldn't be involved in salads but Hey Lucy changed that. I don't know why I ordered it - probably the martini's fault. The added chicken was very juicy, nicely seasoned and very generously portioned. It wasn't dry what-so-ever. The spicy pecans were realllly good too. 

It was one of those meals where you never want to leave. 
I'll be back, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"After a lovely time at the ballet - my boy and I ended up here for dinner. 
We were seated upstairs for a more intimate setting.  I think they waitress was a little clueless on how to seat patrons.  Usually there is a seating pattern until things get busy.  Out of the WHOLE entire EMPTY upstairs - she decided to sit us right next to the only other people upstairs (a party of 6 ppl). We were basically on their laps.   My boyfriend actually asked if we could move across the way to a table for 2 - she did the classic blonde move \"oh yeah sure- but if it gets busy we'll have to move the tables together\".  I'm thinking uhhh don't worry we'll be outta here before you get packed for the night. 

I ended up with the seafood pasta which was great.  Loaded with lots of fresh seafood and creamy tomato sauce.   My guy had another pasta dish which he quite enjoyed. 
With my meal I had a glass of red which I think had been sitting for awhile - it tasted like vinegar.  I didn't say anything.  Maybe a cocktail would've been a better choice. 

To end the night we had the dessert pizza which was drizzled with chocolate and icecream.  Great thing to share if you don't want to overstuff yourself. 

In all the bill came out to roughly $65-70.  Which is decent considering we through in a dessert and a glass of wine.   
I would definetely come here again! :)"}
{"text":"I loved the tiny, cozy, friendly atmosphere here. Also, the food is decently priced and delicious, and the drinks are cheap. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Service. I had the Macaroni and cheese which came as Penne in one of the best Alfredo Sauces I've ever had. My friend had the Chicken Parmesan with a fantastic light Italian gravy instead of Tomato Sauce. We kept stealing from each other's plates both were so good. Great price for dinner without drinks. We went on a Wednesday, and They had a nice Martini special. Only issue was a way too loud table near us, but they left just as our food arrived so the night ended up great. Will definitely be back soon, even if I go by myself."}
{"text":"The Carlton location of Hey Lucy, I find, is better than the King street one.
The pizza is practically the same -- delicious. So are the cocktails (also, Wednesdays they're super cheap!).

However, it feels much more spacious than the King street one, since it is not as narrow. It also has a patio in the back, which has a strange European feel to it. It is walled-up by neighbouring buildings, but it is very charming. Very simple, but very nice. 

Nothing really to complain about. I'd highly recommend giving it a go on a Wednesday evening over the summer when it's nice out. The patio fills up quite quickly, which is rather nice, because you don't even know it exists. Definitely one of the highlights of Cabbagetown, now!"}
{"text":"I'm writing a second review as I came back here (the only restaurant near me with cheap drinks and hardly any customers). Not much has changed since my first review.
This time, there were different staff and they were more polite this time, however it took ten minutes for one out of the four servers literally standing around the bar talking to take my drink order. I was the only one at the bar and only one table in the restaurant was occupied (by three people).
I have been a server and it does not take ten minutes to take a drink order.
During my time, I'm still not actually sure who was serving me. The people who took my drink order, made my drink, took my food order, brought me my food, and who I paid the bill to were all different. It's one thing to help out your coworkers, but it doesn't mean you need to have five different people serving one person sitting at the bar. Although none of the staff were rude, they really did not care. I had finished eating (the \"bacon\" mac and cheese--it was pretty good but overpriced, also the bacon wasn't bacon... it was definitely chunks of ham. Same animal, I guess, but definitely not bacon) and my first drink and I waited another ten minutes before I was asked if I wanted anything.
Honestly I should have learned from my first visit, service is awful for mediocre food and good drinks. Stick to the King street location if you want to have your food and drinks before the next month."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go out with friends! It has something for everyone and the marini night is a hit! Love it in the summer when the windows are open. 
That said, the food itself is not particularly memorable. This is a place I would go more for the atmosphere than the food."}
{"text":"This place has a bargain $4.99 cocktails every Wednesday. It was however super busy on a Wednesday evening. We had to wait for the table to be cleaned. It also hosts a large patio which is ideal during the summer long evenings. I was blown away by the large size of the sweet potato fries. The side dip was super tangy and spicy and thinking of it makes me salivate. It was presented in a cone-shaped container. They deserve five stars simply because the cocktail was so strong. It actually felt like a drink. My two friends also enjoyed their drinks because it was so strong and on point. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a nice long evening with good friends finishing the evening with good food. The ambience in here is perfect."}
{"text":"My TIFF caveat: Short and sweet reviews!

Fast service, decent food, fun vibe."}
{"text":"Arrived at opening for brunch, and was greeted by the hostess boorishly yelling at the door for not working properly. That put a dent in the mood for the entire visit.

30 minutes after ordering, we were informed that there were no English muffins available for the Eggs Benedict. At opening. For brunch.

My toast came out cold and the coffee was terrible. The home fries were excellent, and the mimosas were tasty.

The place was completely empty the whole time, except for one other customer. Overall, not a very inviting or enjoyable atmosphere, in spite of the lovely, dark decor of the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're into healthy eating, this place doesn't have  much to offer. What is available is greasy. It's ok. nothing awesome. Good music though"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friends on a Friday night. It wasn't busy so we didn't need to wait to be seated. We chose to sit upstairs on the patio- it was lovely. I really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere. 

Our waitress was friendly but the food took awhile to come out- considering the restaurant wasn't super busy.

We ordered Grilled Calamari ($11) as a starter to share between the 4 of us but I was disappointed by the size of the dish. I only got a bite and a half of the calamari. It was pretty tender but I don't think it was worth the price.

I ordered Caprese Salad ($11.50) and I thought it was pretty good. The mixed greens were fresh and I enjoyed the pesto balsamic dressing. Also, the portion size was perfect- not too big and not too small."}
{"text":"Great patio - great service. Better than the Bloor location for sure.

Food wise, come here for a pizza. It's a no brainer - that is definately their specialty. 
Drink wise, they always have great specials."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, killer HUGE nachos, so big I was almost to full to eat the pizza that came to the table next up which was also fantastic.. Great sauce and crust (two key components of a great pizza)!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a quick bite to eat  and a few drinks with girlfriends or even a date. It has a nice \"datey\" atmosphere...you know what I mean; dim lighting from pretty chandeliers and fake animal print on the benches, but done in a classy way.  :)

I went with a few girlfriends, but definitely observed a few couples on dates!  I've been here before as well for a birthday party and they can accommodate quite a large group if you call ahead, so that is nice.

Cheap martinis on Wednesdays and a wine deal on Thursdays I believe. Food is nothing spectacular, but it's decent."}
{"text":"Solid Italian restaurant in a great part of downtown Toronto. Highly recommend the black and blue old fashion - was the best cocktail I've had in town. Great pizza and delicious desert if you've saved room and I have to say the kale salad was on point. This is a must go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Light wine poor. Meh.  5 oz that's the rules.  Looks edgy. Not really."}
{"text":"VIBE 
After not being able to get any sort of seat at Earl's down the street, coming to Hey Lucy and snagging a spot on their rooftop patio was a nice relief in the summer weather. We were lucky to get one of two to three seats available. Service is good. 


WE DRANK
Heineken. Nothing beats a nice, cold brew on a hot day. 
I've had food here before. It's ok. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Hey! They have a secret rooftop patio even if you don't notice the blantantly obvious sign across the front saying \"ROOFTOP PATIO.\" Great after work or on a late afternoon weekend."}
{"text":"Fast service, tons of Mill Street Organic on tap and the brick oven pizzas are pretty good."}
{"text":"The best description of the restaurant is down in the comments \"...you'll do in a pinch\"

If you're on the way to an event and need a bite before you go, or you want a chill patio, this place is sufficient. But if you want to bring someone out for a great dining experience, it's not going to wow you. 

The menu is the same and executed quite similarly to the Bloor restaurant, so the consistency is quite reliable.  And the food is quite solid. The menu options are pretty tasty 

I'd argue that the Lucy's on Bloor is staffed by friendlier staff and the atmosphere is nicer, but I think that depends on the time you visit. 

If you want to grab a nice drink before the TIFF movie, this place will do and won't charge you a silly amount unlike its neighbours."}
{"text":"This place is honestly a great relaxing place to spend an evening at. The service is always very kind and attentive. 

The food is not too bad either. I recommend the pizza as it's made in-house which is tasty and not soggy like so many other handmade pizzas. The rest of the food is alright but not necessarily made with the freshest ingredients (I still think that the reason they used parsley on the bruschetta is because they ran out of basil) but it is still tasty.

The restaurant itself is quite lovely and has a wonderful patio (think heating lamps with string of lights). It's low-lit, has wonderfully comfortable seating and laid out in a way so that even when it's busy, you can still have a comfortable conversation. It's also pretty reliable on Fridays (it can be difficult to find space on weekend/Friday nights in Toronto)."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.

I ordered a pasta, and it had a beautiful flare to it, and was not drowned in sauce. The staff are friendly, talkative, and nice decor on the inside and a huge patio!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. It has a great atmosphere and the service is fast and friendly.

I have been here twice now, and I have ordered the chicken calzone and the chicken pizza which were both delicious. This is really a typical Italian restaurant which serves up pasta and pizza, however based on my friends'  meals, you should stick to pasta and pizza and here is why:

The daily special \"Irish Stew\" was questionable, probably because there was NO BEEF in it. It wasn't even \"stewy\" looking. It looked like a vegetable soup from a can! At first I thought I got the wrong order and then the chef told our waitress that was the Irish stew. The fish my other friend ordered was supposed to be pan fried but seemed more like poached.  

Overall, it was actually quite good. However, I would stick to pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"Went there with girlfriend for dinner before we go back home. The service is great there, the waitress are very nice and cheerful, really brighten up your day when people around you are positive and happy. :)
We had ordered a bruschetta and a chicken & Brie pizza, it was totally enough for both of us. The food came to our table in about 10-15 minutes, we were in hurry so it was slow for us, but I'm sure when you have all the time in the world, that's a good time length for good food to be ready. :9
The coffee here is FREE to refill, great thing to all coffee lovers!!! 
While we were so full, we still ordered the chocolate cake, since it was recommended on here. Lol but still took them a long time to be ready and bring to our table. The cake was good, but not very special which I don't know why everyone is saying it's a MUST-EAT...:1
Overall, good food, great service and good price. Just that they tend to take a lot of time to prepare thee food. I wouldn't go there if I'm on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Good value. Terrific Mac n cheese, with bacon. Adult Mac n cheese!
Pizza with pineapple was good but a bit undercooked. Nice servers, hot spot with beautiful people. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love the rooftop patio and the waitresses were so nice!  We just had a drink each - Big Apple Caramel Martini is awesome - fried calamari then two Capps and the sfolia pastry dessert - yummmmmmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hey Lucy on Martini Night (every Wednesday night martini's are only 3.99! Very dangerous...) several times and I have been quite happy with the beverages. 

For the most part the service has been good, but there have been a couple of incidents...Most noteworthy being the time that my friend was attempting to hold a table for us after work and she was informed that she could sit in the table, but may be booted from it if we didn't all show up within the next 5 minutes. Come on! Are you kidding me?! Is that any way to treat a customer?? 

The food is pretty decent, but the main allure is the drinks in my opinion. I always enjoy the \"Hey Lucy\" martini (something about drinks w. cherries in them that just makes you feel girly) and the \"Jolly Rancher\" martini comes with gummy bears in it!  In the mood for something more chocolatey? The \"Caramilk\" martini is sinfully divine!

If you're planning on going on Martini Night be aware that they don't take reservations, so you have to get there early to get a table."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy. And BYE Lucy. Although the decor is cute and trendy, the service friendly, the food is no where near up to par. I went for brunch. The hollandaise is factory made, the English muffin dry with charred bits and charred flavour. They left my yolks runny, which was great and exactly what I asked for, but the whites weren't fully cooked. They don't use high quality eggs and you can taste it. 

I'm glad I didn't order coffee because my friends sent theirs back twice because it tasted funny. Turns out the creamers and milkers weren't at their freshest. It's cheap though and comes with fresh fruit. They have lots of potential but need to step it up a couple of notches. I guess there was a reason it was empty on a Saturday morning.

I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here before going to see a show. Everything was delicious. We ordered different pasta dishes with side salads and thought the portions were a great size and the flavours were awesome! Also we split the fried cheesecake with hazelnut gelato and thought we had died! Best dessert I've had in a long long time! Service was great and prices were very reasonable. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great decor, cheap martinis, friendly staff, terrible brunch. 

Why decide to have a weekend brunch menu if you don't know how to make bacon? Though I'm not particularly picky about my bacon (mm.. bacon...), my company was. They specifically asked for it \"very, very, crispy\" and managed to get completely floppy, greasy bacon. After it being sent back THREE times, it finally came back... half burned black, half floppy and rubbery.... how is this even possible?

Though they do make amazing Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast, the fact that they don't understand the process of frying bacon and the $5 Tropicana OJ is going to keep me away from another brunch there, but hey [Lucy], I'll go back for the $3.99 martinis."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my girl friends for my birthday. I had a lovely experience. The food and drinks were delicious, the atmosphere was great and our waitress Sydney was very sweet, attentive and accommodating. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing. I had the vegetarian last night and it was delicious, perfectly crispy thing crust and loaded with veggies. 
The beers are around $6 which is cheaper than many places that you'll go. 

Check out the upstairs patio on a nice night. 

Outside seating at the street level is very limited so good luck getting a seat out there on a nice night. There's only about 4 tables."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in King West! Have been here a few times and have always really enjoyed the food :) the Swedish berry martini is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I have ever eaten. Good service and a fair price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OK other than bourbon and pizza my review will be short. But guess what?! I love Bourbon and pizza! So Hey Lucy has top marks. The first time I walked in I was greeted by a fellow named Harry. I told him that I had heard about their pizza. I ordered. 
\"A drink while you wait?\", god bless Harry. I asked if he had bourbon, and boy do they.  We chatted for a bit. Nice guy. In my mind a proper bartender. He made drinks and still kept up his patter. 

   I had the pizza to go, when I got home it was still piping hot fresh and delicious. My gal said that was the best pizza in Toronto. I said, \"It was Harrys suggestion.\""}
{"text":"Service was awesome. The food was delish. 

I will come back here to bring my family or a date. Why do I keep talking about dates? I keep forgetting this is not eharmony or Yahoo personal. 

Moving on... 

Hey Lucy looks fancier than other neighbourhood restaurant in the Annex but not pricier. The waiter was extremely nice and constantly asking if we needed something else. 

We gave him a generous tip. 

I came here for brunch and will check the place again. With or without  date."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we dined here on vacation in Toronto.  We had a lovely evening so sat on the rooftop deck.  We shared the nachos which had mozzarella marinara olives green peppers and we're deep fried chips.  Our service was fast and friendly.   Nice experience."}
{"text":"Decent patio and the service has improved leaps and bounds since this place first opened. I remember it being horrible the first time I went, but now, a couple years later and it's a lot better.

The food should generally to be avoided (not good) but it's an ok option for drinks. Wednesdays has $4 martinis and Thursdays has $5 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!!
Hey Lucy's does one thing pretty damn well, and that is the $4 WednesdayTini night!
Where else can you get a variety of Martinis with a decent amount of liquor for $4??.... Don't answer that question, I'm sure there are other places...regardless of this notion, Hey Lucy on Bloor happens to do a pretty good job of making them most of the time, and serves as one of the top Wed. night watering holes for a good bunch of regulars!
The service is very friendly and quite efficient considering how busy it gets, and although I have had the wrong drink brought out a couple of times, the waitstaff has been very consistent with replacing the drink it or leaving it off the cheque!

If you go for the martinis and you're open to trying the fruitier ones, the Jolly Rancher (with vodka, melon liquor, schnapps and gummy bears at the bottom) is a good choice, as is the hard hitting chocolate martini! Godzilla and Curious George are also worth mentioning. See you on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Daniel and I enjoyed the pizza here very much. We both made our own, mine with the garlic rosemary oil, light mozzarella, tomatos, arugula, and topped with fresh parm. Daniel made his with the garlic rosemary oil and light mozz as well but topped with with chicken, bacon and steak. The dough was very good, a nice Neapolitan style with good flavor. Our only complaint was that the service was pretty slow, especially considering the fact that there were only 3 tables when we ordered."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and sat on the front patio. It's been a while since I've been here.

$11 for rosemary chicken pesto panini with caesar salad
$3.99 for a martini

The food was decent. The service was decent. The location was decent.
My only complain is the noise today. The area next door was doing construction during the daytime (they really shouldnt) and the airshow going on, plus the fire trucks. 

Not somewhere i'd suggest for great food. But decent for a patio outing if you're just lounging around on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"We usually don't walk this far East for weekend brunch (I usually end up in Kensington), but with the beautiful weather this weekend I figured why not. 

Ended up at Hey Lucy (with a more reasonable brunch start time of 10:00am) and was NOT disappointed. In fact, it looks like this might be my new brunch place. 

My partner had the lumberjack breakfast, whereas I had the veggie breakfast with a side slice of French Toast. 

We sat on the patio, and it was glorious. 

The food was very well done (the homefries were seriously delicious, albeit a little salty), and the eggs were clearly of good quality (great flavour, rich yolk, not too runny or liquidy). 

Both breakfasts were fantastic, and the rest of the menu has inspired me to try new things next time I go. They also had great drink specials, but only started serving at 11, so we were out of luck. 

Really a great brunch, and paid the same price as we usually do at the much less fancy (and less delicious) K-OS on bathurst/ dupont. 

Will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Came here by fluke as one of the other restaurants were closed. It is pretty good for the price you pay. We ordered the garlic bread and margarita pizza. Both were delicious. The pizza crust was little burnt but the tomato sauce was so fresh and tasty that it made up for the little burnt crust. Would love to try their pasta someday as they looked awesome when they were being served to other guests."}
{"text":"Arrived for Sunday brunch with a very large group (~15). They were accommodating for our large group and allowed for separate cheques. Sat in the back patio, a large area surrounded by a lovely destressed wood fence, fountain in the centre and strings of lights that would make for great ambiance in the evening. Lots of great choices and had drink specials for brunch. I had the mango mimosa, which actually didn't have much mango flavour to it.

Although we had a large group, there weren't many others in the restaurant, we still waited an hour for our food to arrive. Some people didn't receive their coffees for some time and needed to reorder them. The wood-fired oven made it smell like you were at the cottage. We ordered the smoked bacon pesto pizza. It was delicious. Crust wasn't too thick with large pieces of artichoke and bacon. Perfect size for sharing or for the hungry individual. I ordered the steak and eggs. Asked for medium rare steak and it arrived medium with not a hint of pink. The breakfast potatoes were delicious and loved the colourfulness they brought to my plate. House salad had the perfect amount of dressing. Eggs were done as ordered; sunnyside. If the wait wasn't so long, would have give it a 4/5. But the steak could have been done better."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend before going to the symphony at Roy Thomson Hall on a dreary Sunday afternoon. We got here around 1pm and it was pretty empty inside; no reservation necessary. 

I ordered the roasted veg and goat cheese panini with sweet potato fries (so typical me). My friend asked if she could have one of their wraps on a panini instead, and her request was graciously accommodated.

Our food came out fairly quickly, however I noticed that my panini came with fries instead of the sweet potato fries I had ordered. I can be harsh and critical on Yelp but I'm really meek as a lamb in real life, so I didn't want to mention it. Our hawk-eyed server somehow noticed my friend and I muttering about the mix-up and she brought an order of sweet potato fries to our table right away. Amazing. 

My panini was quite good - warm roasted vegetables with plenty of goat cheese on a chewy bun that was nice and crispy on the outside. The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, had a bit of a greasy taste that I wasn't the most fond of. I didn't have anything to drink other than water for fear that I would nod off during the symphony, but they have an extensive list of martinis that I would go back to try one day!   

Service was pleasant and quick, and we were in and out in about an hour. Also, everything on the menu seems very reasonably priced - my total for a very filling lunch came to less than $15! As mentioned by other reviewers, the decor here is funky and cool, making Hey Lucy a great pick for a girls night out."}
{"text":"I've never eaten in because the music is always so loud but I decided to try it out for take out (this was probably last year). I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which were stated to cost something like $11.50 on the menu posted outside. I placed my order and came back later. The bill came to over 15 dollars! I asked what was up with that and she said \"oh the pricing on that menu is out of date\" uh ok... Then maybe someone should take some initiative and update it so people know how much they're spending. She should have apologized and offered to charge me the price as advertised. Instead I felt mislead. 

Oh top of that the dish was bland with watery sauce and the bread was burnt. 

Very disappointed with the quality, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"$5.00 margarita nights on Wednesday. Go for the ones with gummy bears in it :) my personal favorite! The service is very good as well and the rooftop patio is very nice. A cute date night spot."}
{"text":"Cappuccino was awesome with Lavazza coffee beans obviously. Love the vintage decoration and rooftop patio here. Omg tiff bellbox is just cross the street"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of the venue, the service was fast and the server was really nice, and the food was pretty good. I got the pepperoni mozzarella calzone, which was delicious, but the side salad was kind of meh. It was just iceberg lettuce, tomato, and onion. It was ok just nothing special. All in all it was a great lunch spot in a great location. Would definitely come here again and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on June 10, 2017. We made a reservation for a party of 8. 

Food: great food and great selection. I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo and fried calamari. Both were delicious, very tasty. Portions were decent as well. I would've given this place at least 4 stars but keep reading to find out why I'm giving them 1 star. 

Now, onto the service. TERRIBLE. As soon as my friends and I walked in, the hostess/server (the much older lady with grey hair) was not happy to see us. No \"Hi, how are you\". No smile. NOTHING. In fact, she was annoyed to see us come in. We were there to celebrate my and my friend's birthday so we brought a birthday cake with us and asked the server if she could keep it in the fridge for us. Again, she was extremely rude and said \"you want this in the fridge\" in an annoyed way like \"are you serious?\" kind of tone. She very unwillingly put it in the fridge. When she came to take our orders for drinks, not everyone wanted alcohol. Every time one of my friends said they're ok with water, she goes \"nothing, nothing, nothing\" in an annoyed way. Not everyone drinks, what's wrong with sticking with water? 

We tried to get her attention to take our orders, she walks right past our table, ignoring us. We asked again if she could take our orders and she talked back rudely, \"can i serve the other table first? That's cool right?\" in a VERY RUDE WAY. She could've said, \"I'm sorry. Could you give me a minute?\"  in a nice tone of voice. But she was clearly annoyed of us. The other table just sat down and got their menus already. What does she have to serve? On the other hand, we asked her to take our orders many times and got ignored. We couldn't help but agreed that she is completely racist. When she finally took our orders, she did not say \"what would you like to order?\" Or \"thank you\". She just goes \"you?\" or just stands there in silence so that we didn't know if she's taking our orders. Instead of saying \"let me take those menus from you\" or something, she just yanks it out of our hands. She lacks basic manners. One thing I failed to mention: the majority of us were asians. She was nice and friendly and smiled to other tables who were not asians. 

I've never experienced such hate, racism and annoyance from any servers towards customers at restaurants before. She completely ruined our birthdays. We did nothing to offend. It's my birthday and I shouldn't be wasting time writing this review but this is completely unacceptable. She doesn't even meet the minimum standards of customer service. Be warned: do NOT come here and expect good customer service if you're asian."}
{"text":"This was a weird experience. I think the table next to us was full of drama students... or they might just simply have been very eccentric people. A third of the way through dinner, a guy with eyeliner and a girl from the table started singing songs from disney movies to a table next to us. It was hard to ignore... 

Anyway food was reeeeally mediocre. Compared to other food in the area it really lacked. It's a shame because I heard good things about Hey Lucy, but those comments were directed to the one on King. Not sure if they're different, but after this experience I won't bother checking it out.

Those people singing were so happy. I HATE happy people they're freakin annoying. Just let me eat my overpriced pizza pocket in peace."}
{"text":"Just arrived to Toronto on a rainy Sunday and found Hey Lucy on Yelp and pictures looked mouth watering. The food was delish...Cesar salad and veggie pizza...we split both and had a drink.   Food and service both stellar.  I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Had some the chicken and brie pizza and their pear salad, split both with a date. 

We sat in the backyard patio, which is an excellent space. It's well-kept and peaceful. The waitress is very attentive and checked in on us every so often and was knowledgeable about the menu. 

The pear salad was excellent; had some pecan in there which was spicy, had a nice amount of kick. The pizza was amazing; it was thin-crust which made it perfect to fit with a salad/app plus drink. 

If you're looking for a nice pizza place for friends or to take a date to, I highly recommend Hey Lucy."}
{"text":"I love Hey Lucy!
I only sit on the outdoor patio.
The service is great.
The foods good.
The martinis/coctails are amazing!!!
They have a woodburning fire for pizza!!! - deff reccomended to get their pizza.
Not a huge menu - italian food.

Always eat here!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, it wasn't quiet when we arrived, but it wasn't too busy either and we were greeted right away.  Everything was perfect about this experience from drink order being taken, learning about the specials, cleanliness, service and especially quality of the food.  I love pizza, and I LOVED my wood fired pizza.  I'll be back!  I spent most of my life in Hospitality and my only suggestion is that the manager check in with each table once; not needed or required just a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the patio and food. You also feel very welcomed there. They get to know you by name. Love that they have added this to the east side"}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful drinks. Great atmosphere, food looked great but didn't try it. Was more interested the boozing. All in all a great Friday cocktail spot to sit outside and have some conversation"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and has one of the cutest patios in Toronto! I said it! While in a relatively pricey area (at least all the other spots I've been to here are) this place isn't as bad as some of it's neighbours, though it's not the cheapest place in the world either. I came on Wednesday for their $5 martinis and I really enjoyed the ones I ordered! I got the grilled vegetable and goat cheese panini as well, which was really good and filling! I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I was willing to spend a little more than normal."}
{"text":"So the meal at Hey Lucy was fantastic. My mother and I are on a girls trip and we ended our long tiring day here. We were draw in from the street with a sign that read \"Martini Wednesday\". Ummm... yes please! 

We were waited on by Alex who is the sweetest waitress, she hooked us up with some speedy martinis (Sextini and Lemon Drop) we decided to split some menu items including the Fried Calamari (on point), the Kale Salad (extremely fresh with Lemon Herb dressing ) and the Chicken Brie Pizza which was straight up divine!! 

Atmosphere was great, staff amazing and all in all would definitely be back if I lived here. Stop, drink and eat, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come here on Wednesday's for their $4.50 Martinis. A bustling place with an awesome staff! They're food is pretty good, but I wouldn't say it stands out from the rest."}
{"text":"Hey Lucy...you are not the iconic classic you would like to be.  

We read the reviews and gave this restaurant a try...to say the least we were disappointed with the service and would not return.  The menu is diverse and the food we selected was very tasty so that is what saved this review from being a 1 star!  There is a great patio but one table is under a unprunned tree that makes it awkward to enjoy a meal, the wait staff was unfriendly and slow to bring out the orders and we had no follow up to ensure we were satisfied with our meals.  The music was too loud and electronic dance music does not fit with the vibe of the restaurant or the predominant age group of the clientele.

The Annex has many restaurant options to choose from and some changes would need to be made here before I would go back."}
{"text":"The service sold this place for me. It wasn't busy, my friend and I felt very attended to, and the manager (maybe? His name is Kevin) gave us a lot of info about Toronto because we are from out of town. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly. 

Menu is a little small. I would give the food three stars. My calzone was pretty darn good. My friend liked her sandwich, but the fries could have used more flavor. No beer menu, but it was easy enough to tell what they had.

Atmosphere is nice for such a small place!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Thumbs up to the Wednesday Martini nights. I had the Caramilk and the Lychee martini, and they were yum, says the girl who doesn't like martinis!

The patio was cozy and the staff was attentive. And surprisingly, it was packed but still pleasant enough to hang out. I can definitely see more weeknight chillaxin sessions here!!!"}
{"text":"Came around 2 pm on a Thursday. We were seated upstairs on the patio which was nice. Drinks tasted a bit watered down/weak. (mojito) There were two girls running food between the main level & rooftop. They were both nice just seemed a bit of a stretch. The wood oven pizza was actually really good. The reason for only two stars was the weak drinks and there were no napkins insight. I ended up pouring my water on my hands to wash them off. I would recommend it just make sure you ask for napkins & utensils!"}
{"text":"Hey Lucy, you'll do in a pinch! 

After a night at the theatre, myself, my darling mother and my loving husband decided to have a night cap. We were on King W and Jack Frost is a bitch, so we weren't willing to go far. Of everything in this hood, I deemed this the most likely to be the most civilized on a Wednesday night, and it was A OK. 

They are still rocking their cheap sugary martini specials after all of these years, and I would definitely deem this a tinder date bar. The pizza smelled good, the music wasn't too loud and I got ID'd on the way in. Some wins, some losses, but again, Lucy'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars

Our group decided to try out Hey Lucy for lunch after reading reviews and its convenient location. 

We were the first group to arrive for lunch at 11:45 on a Monday. The restaurant is quite small and so were the tables. Service was pretty fast except the time it took for our food to arrive. I ordered the pepperoni and mozzarella calzone with a caesar side salad. My sister ordered the rose chicken fusilli with a caesar side salad. My boyfriend ordered the grill flatiron steak and cheese wrap with a side house salad. 

Food tasted pretty good and it came out fresh and hot! We were all able to finish our entire portion and were happily full. 

I would definitely come visit again to try something else plus it's pretty cheap for a restaurant on King Street. However, I wish they had bigger tables because the table for the three of us was pretty small. But then again the restaurant is small so it makes sense."}
{"text":"Great food and location.  I had one of the best calzones in my life there.  Their marinara sauce has a but of kick and it's so delicious.  We started out by having a couple of martini's which were very good and then right into dinner.  Space is cozy, great atmosphere and value for your money."}
{"text":"good brick oven pizza, 20oz beers"}
