{"text":"Perfect brunch choice for a casual Saturday. I love the mushroom crepe with extra egg, and the Americano is awesome. The sour cream muffin is also a must-try."}
{"text":"The food at Luna is truly amazing. I've had the ham crepe and the turkey crepe, as well as several desserts. Both crepes were very tasty, but not overwhelming - they were both delicate and filling, which I honestly thought was an oxymoron. They blended light, just-right amounts of flavor, and are plenty big for lunch. And the desserts are wonderful - flavorful and sweet without being overpowering. And they're just the right size.

I will say that the staff could be more friendly. They are clearly hardworking people who want to deliver the best possible food, and they do that very well. But they could do a little more to be friendly and focus on making the customer feel welcome, so be forewarned. But the food is so darn good that I'm giving 5 stars anyway."}
{"text":"Like many others have said, it is great to have another coffee shop/cafe in the Cedar/Fairmount area (who else is tired of there being no seats at the Sbucks?)! I was excited to check this place out at the recommendation of my roommate. 

I love the decor inside. It is bright, well-lit, clean and fun. The inside is rather small and gets very crowded especially around lunchtime. Today the line was out the door! 

I tired the smoked turkey (provolone, spinach and tomato pesto) crepe today. I personally didn't care for it, which was a bummer since it cost $7. However, I'd love to go back and try some of their tasty looking desserts. 

My only recommendation to the owners is to add outlets. For someone who doesn't have an office and works from cafes/coffee shops, this was very disappointing. Unless this is on purpose, I'd suggest adding at least one (since there is not a single outlet!)."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for brunch. I had the spinach and mushroom crepe, my daughter had the spinach salad. Both were delicious!  My daughter has an allergy to gluten, so got the Luna Cake. It was awesome!  I got a lemon macaroon and a lemon bar. Both were delicious. We are going back today!"}
{"text":"great place! Love coming in for breakfast or a quick coffee and macaroon : )"}
{"text":"Don't get your wedding cake here!!!!
I met with the staff to go over exactly what I wanted for my wedding cake. I showed them a picture of my desired cake and had a cake tasting. I was told it was not a problem. I was excited and paid in full well in advance. 

On my wedding day, the cake was not at all what I ordered. It looked and tasted completely different from what I asked for. Even some of my guests commented on how horrible it tasted. Why have a cake tasting if they were not going to give me what I requested?? The bakery didn't even provide boxes to take home leftovers!

The bakery gave me a 50% refund but only after I called and emailed them for a few months. They didn't seem apologetic at all. I would not recommend this bakery!!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Finally made it here for the first time today, and I was so impressed. The atmosphere is wonderful: cozy, European feeling, modestly elegant and yet comfortable and casual. The service is extremely friendly, and they handled the busy hour without generating stress--just great. The coffee was quite tasty (and I had an iced decaf, which few can pull off well), and the Mediterranean salad was delicious. The crepes look fantastic--can't wait to try. Fresh water always full, and a little dish of lemon left out: so considerate. Menu is not large but very well-selected, with good options for us vegetarians and pescetarians--thank you! Even the separate breakfast menu looks inventive and appealing, and thankfully not all sugar- or pastry-based. All of this with free wifi, free parking, and a great price point. As an added plus, the music was actually good (John Cale's Hallelujah?! Wow.). 

I expect to want to come here very frequently, either for drinking coffee and reading/working on my laptop during slow hours, or having lunch with a friend, or for a little sweet in the evening (wait until you see the dessert case). This would also be a neat place for brunch, albeit just for one or two couples. But on the plus side, you get crepes for brunch! 

To the owners: you guys got *everything* right!"}
{"text":"Libby created our spectacular Wedding cake! My husband and I LOVED it! It was gorgeous as well as scrumptious. Thanks Libby and Luna Bakery Cafe!"}
{"text":"Their food is truly delightful! I have ordered soup, sandwiches, salads and desserts here and they all taste very fresh. Luna is a great option for someone who is looking for a healthier meal with more natural ingredients. I do think it is overpriced for the portions because I never leave satiated and spend about $12 on lunch."}
{"text":"Living in Pittsburgh now but having grown up in Cleveland, one of the things I love to do when I'm back home is go with my wife to try places that didn't exist when I was growing up there. Luna Bakery has been on our radar for a while and today we stopped in for lunch. Let me just say, I wish we'd gone sooner. 

The special today was a roast chicken, spinach, provolone, pesto combo available as a panini or a crepe. I went for the panini while my wife went for the crepe. Both were fantastic. You could tell the roast chicken was actual whole roast chicken picked off the bone, which I vastly prefer to the usual paradigm of boneless skinless breast that just lacks the same flavor you get with dark meat in the mix. The pesto was bright and flavorful as well. The meal was rounded out with good strong iced coffees and treats from their expansive selection of baked goods. The macarons I had (strawberry rhubarb, salted caramel, hazelnut, and passion fruit) were light and flavorful, really showcasing the various flavors as opposed to the ones you get some places that essentially taste like naught but almond flavored sugar. My wife had the chocolate peanut butter mousse torte that, while not as peanut buttery as she would have liked, was nevertheless extremely rich and smooth. 

We definitely enjoyed our visit and will be putting it in the regular rotation when we're in town"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch during a recent business trip and it was excellent. I had the tomato/pesto/mozz panini and it was very good! Pesto wasn't too harsh as it can be sometimes, and the sandwich was the perfect size. I also had the gluten-free Luna Cake as a dessert, and it was out of this world. I'm not on a gluten diet, but this cake rocked - very moist and chocolatey. I would come here again in a heartbeat if I ever return to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love this place! Crepes and soups are excellent, highly recommend! Besides the food, it's also nice community gathering place. You always see people you know."}
{"text":"There are a few hits and misses at the bakery, but all in all, its one of the best bakeries in the city."}
{"text":"this is a really nice place to have in cedar-fairmount area.

all the baked goods are great. i'm a big fan of the ham and cheese croissant, but it can sell out fast on the weekends. coffee is good.

i'm not that big of a fan of the sandwiches, but the breakfast is pretty good, not cheap with add-ons but a not crazy pricey."}
{"text":"I went here specifically to get the French macaroons since there's only a few places in the Cleveland area that make them. These macaroons were just ok. When I bit into them, they crumbled. Who wants crumbly cookies? #NoBueno lol. These don't measure up to others that I've had but my chai latte was good."}
{"text":"We come here pretty often my daughter and I. The pastries vary day to day ( that we've gone) we like that. I've gone inn sometimes and the prep person or the cashier could be a bit short ( not height ) but we've never experienced anyone being plan rude. We will keep going back though, the pastries are tasty and there is room there to sit in and enjoy. Though we have always left and went did coffees elsewhere."}
{"text":"OMG so i USED to like this bakery, i would go here all the time but when i saw this i was to DISGUSTED. So everyone knows how you can see the chefs make their talent, which theryre really good, but all of a sudden i see this i guess prep cook guy, tasting the pico de gallo he was making with some little white spoons the first time and i was like ehh ok to taste it but then he tastes it again with the same spoon and dips it again in the whole pico de gallo, AND THEN AGAIN, i counted 4 times he did it and i was so disgusted. The tasting spoons are suppose to be taste and throw and taste again. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I USE THIS PLACE TO EAT AND THROW MY MONEY AGAIN. I WOULD HAVE GIVIN YOU NO STAR BUT THERE IS NO OPTION. ANOTHER THING YOU MAKE MONEY SO WHY DONT YOU TRAIN YOUR FRONT EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WHEN I SAW THAT MAN TASTE THE FOOD AND PUT THE SPOON IN AGAIN I TOLD YOUR PERSONAL AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE TO DO THIS IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY. I SWEAR I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN. AND I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHICH VISIT YOUR \"BAKERY\" LIKE EVERY LUNCH NOT TO GO THERE!!! IM SORRY AS IF THIS MAY HURT YOUR STORE BUT YOU SHOULD LEARN TO TRAIN AND SELECT YOUR EMPLOYEES."}
{"text":"Luna is perfect for when you're looking for some AM sweet/savory fill up without the commitment of a sit-down, full service brunch place like the Inn on Coventry or something like that. A great place to come if you'd like to enjoy a good (and healthier than most places) breakfast with a couple of friends, or just read the paper and enjoy yourself.

I almost always get the Nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries; it's absolutely delicious. On my most recent visit, I got the oatmeal and was a little disappointed - it had just a tiny scoop of dried fruit and was pretty flavorless, and I had to keep adding cinnamon and honey. Eventually I paid 2 extra dollars at the counter for a cup of blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries, and that helped a lot; just a word of warning. 

The service is quick and friendly. They also have delicious cupcakes/cookies/etc, but I'm usually here in the morning. Get there before 10AM if you want to avoid the biggest crowds."}
{"text":"This is still one of the better restaurants in the Heights, but I have had better crepes in other cities. I still go here and can still recommend it, but I find that quite often the crepes aren't warm enough, especially since they expanded their seating. Too much volume for them, perhaps? Bakery items are still fantastic. Nice place in a historic building."}
{"text":"Fun place to have decadent lunch with mom. We can share (sort of) the chocolate crepe with berries, which is reminiscent in flavor& texture crepes you'll find in Paris. I'd go for the traditional crepe, the whole wheat version is too dense for my taste since the point is light, airy and a hint of light- brown crisp.

They make a fair to meh cappuccino and latte -  keep your expectations in check- if you're anywhere near a coffee nut the staff are college kids who don't know their way around a barista besides the ten minute flash orientation. 

Bakery case is lavish. The photo albums featuring their cake menu a treat to browse thru especially when dining alone !"}
{"text":"Just had a red velvet Cake from Luna's It was the best one I ever had. Beats anything you can find in the South. Just a perfect cake. My serch is over for a bakery in Cleveleand."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic addition to the Fairmount area. It is a bakery that does custom orders (wedding cakes and the like) but they have delicious paninis and crepes as well.

I tried both one of the savory crepes (turkey, provalone, spinach), and one of the sweet crepes (caramelized apple, praline, creme fraiche). Both were delicious and I can't wait to try the rest. The pastries are also very good as you might expect from a bakery. 

The place is very small but cozy, and when the weather is nice there are tables outside as well. Service was friendly and I did not have to wait long at all for my food despite the line of people."}
{"text":"Food was great I had the black forest ham crepe, it was delicious. Only down side I notice is it is very noisy when busy and limited inside seating. They do have outside patio seating in good weather."}
{"text":"Good espresso drinks and croissants is always a plus! Cute outdoor cafe seating: yay!

I was excited that they were doing French macarons until I saw that they were miniature sized (why not the normal size?) and the flavors were so vanilla safe. 

My main complaint is the obnoxious crowd  that takes over the outdoor seating on weekend mornings. Babies, babies in strollers, babies in double, triple strollers, babies in bicycle attachments, bicycles parked next to tables, huge dogs, huge dogs barking at other huge dogs, ultra loudmouthed conversations I'd rather not hear...ugh!

All I want is a bit of peace with my americano and WSJ."}
{"text":"The carmelized apple crepes were outstanding.  Coffee was good not great.  Nice atmosphere.  Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of Luna's, almost like one of those amazing local places in Europe that you find by accident and absolutely fall in love with. Great coffee and incredible crepes with tons of little pastries and goodies to take home!"}
{"text":"I love the food, the coffee is pretty good, and it's a pretty space. But, having now been there a half dozen times in the 4months since we've lived just down the road, I can say that Luna isn't 5 stars because the people who work there seem fairly disinterested in what the customers think. It's an odd vibe that disappoints. C'mon, guys! Show some patron love. I'll never mind spending $4 on one pastry if it's served with a smile."}
{"text":"I'm really excited to have a European style cafe just down the street. Cedar-Fairmount needs an alternative to Starbucks. 

My favorite things I've had there so far include the Mozzerella Panini Sandwich and the Ham and Cheese Croissant. The crepes are also very good, but are sometimes uneven. I felt that one had too much mustard, and another too much tomato paste.

Still waiting for a Croque Monsieur on the menu. It's my favorite french sandwich, and it seems like it would fit right in with the place."}
{"text":"What can I say, though the food is quite good, the wait staff is less than welcoming, the prices? When you order something and an item is removed which would explain the original price, and the price remains the same? Fairly ridiculous! Just this person's opinion. The location is great and the quality is above the usual fast food...maybe the staff could try smiling and welcoming their clientele?"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Luna for a long time. It is in a cute area and cute storefront. I went in on the weekend once with the stroller and was too crowded so finally had a chance to go for lunch. I went here for lunch with my son. Got the mushroom crepe. It was ok- wouldn't get again as had a little odd taste to it. I couldn't tell if the mushrooms were canned and if so, that was the origin of the odd taste. It also was very smokey in the restaurant.  People perhaps due to crepe making? Anyways, started to hurt my eyes. I would go back and try something else."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. FYI, the portions aren't huge and they stop serving food 15 mins? before closing time. The panini's are a good deal."}
{"text":"My wife swears by the macaroons and I likewise have an allegiance to oatmeal and raisins. Tend to dump half my hot chocolate in oatmeal highly recommended! Their cowboy cookies are insane. The only problem is that they don't recycle and that actually really bothers me. I end up taking much of the wrapping and containers home rather than contributing to their large amount of waste. There isn't a better baker in all of Cleveland though and the care given to each product is recognized and thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy lunch option so I ordered the Mediterranean salad with tuna minus the cheese and bread. The salad was so tasty that I didn't miss a thing; it was actually perfect. I'm staying to study a while, and I've already planned to have one (or two or three) of their lovely macaroons with some hot tea. Luna has a great classic cafe atmosphere, although it's a tad crowded this Saturday."}
{"text":"This is the greatest cafe in Cleveland. I just told my boyfriend that we'll be eating here everyday!"}
{"text":"My practitioner at the Cleveland Clinic suggested this place for breakfast. It's in a cute little area. Very friendly service. We ordered a ham, egg and cheese crepe, banana bread, raspberry cheese croissant, reg coffee and a cold brew iced coffee. It was all fresh and flavorful. The dining area is cute, it did seem to need a little tidying up but it wasn't anything that would stop us from returning. They had some delectable looking bakery items that I will try next time."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent, and love the location.  The inside seating situation is always a bit tight and annoying, though!  Suggest going in summer and sitting on the patio if you have the option."}
{"text":"Yay!  We have savory crepes in Cleveland!  I'm a westsider now, but my friend asked to meet on the east side at Luna and it was wonderful.  I loved sitting outdoors and eating savory crepes.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"They catered the lunch for my bridesmaids on my wedding day. We ordered a few pan inis and two salads, and extra coffee. The food was great, they were helpful-it was one less thing to worry about! Great food!"}
{"text":"Luna is a great bakery- delicious meringues, pastries and sandwiches and great ambience. But their coffee is terrible. They don't serve whole milk at all. How can you be a bakery and then suddenly decide to appear to be 'healthy' by eliminating whole milk? Also the cappuccino is not done right- re milk is sometimes steamed too much, sometimes too little. If Luna gets its coffee right, it'll be the perfect cafe."}
{"text":"gave this place a lot of tries, but unfortunately after today I think we are through. After first visiting and having a bug crawl up my jeans I thought, well, it's summer.....but then I saw a mouse today! Thankfully other customers were not as irked since it was a \"cute baby mouse\". Unfortunately that was my queue to wonder \"shoot that means there's most likely a mama mouse....\" and thus leave and discard the rest of my meal. id prefer not to be part of a real-life ratatouille sequel. Everything regarding food & drink at Luna is great, but I can't feel good about returning to a place where I question the cleanliness... sorry :("}
{"text":"A lovely little place!  Tasty herb scrambled eggs with multigrain toast!  (The fresh raspberry jam was a surprise treat!) My husband and teenage-kids had the paninis, which they loved!  Pleasantly crowded on a Sunday early afternoon too. So much more on the menu that I'd like to try. We'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Luna is by far my favorite breakfast AND lunch cafe!  They have a wonderful selection of pastries, croissants, crepes, macarons, cakes and eggs and paninis.  Everyday there is almost always something new!  Everything is made Fresh daily and of coarse there are many coffee, tea and juice assortments to choose from.  When you stop by you will think you have stepped into a bakery cafe in Europe!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes in all of Cleveland, and they definitely have the BEST macarons in the area! Their crepes are fantastic, and each and every one of their pastries are delicious!!! Their signature Luna cake is another one of my personal favorites. And don't even get me started on their lemon bars! You don't want to miss out on this place!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! There were 8 of us and we came in right after the big lunch rush on holiday weekend.  We tried macarons (fantastic,) soups, breads, crepes, BBQ panini... This is the kind of bakery/eatery worthy of many returns to try their entire menu. (I don't say that often.)"}
{"text":"For Cleveland and the East Side, Luna is a welcome addition to the Cedar Fairmount neighborhood.  The staff, ambiance, food, and coffee are spot on and the cafe makes for a great alternative to the anchored-to-my-table-for-hours-to-study Starbucks vibe.  You come here to enjoy, even indulge, and to catch a break from the usual."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. The place is always busy but the wait is worth it! The workers are kind and helpful. It's always clean and the food is so fresh! Wonderful place to go and have lunch on a nice day!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great neighborhood spot in Cleveland Heights about 5-miles east of the skyline and close to The Cleveland Clinic. Ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Crépe and the Caramelized Apples and Pralines Crépe. Quick service. Enjoyed them both and sat outside on the front patio under an umbrella for breakfast. Good spot!"}
{"text":"I am a huge brand new fan of Luna. Since it's on the east side and I'm on the west it's a special treat every time I visit. The food menu is solid and each item I've tried is just as good as my order before. I mean what other bakery offers pulled pork?! 

The bakery selection is what dreams are made of. I imagine myself as a kid ooing and awwing over every item because as an adult that's what I do every time. I never know what to choose. The crepe cake (that I've never seen any where else in Cleveland), the cinnamon rolls, the cookies...the options are endless. I also know they do specialty cakes. What don't they do?

Do yourself a favor and add this to your must visit Cleveland places if you've never been!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop with pretty decent food, but it's overpriced for you get. This would have been a 3-4 star review, but the staff has a major attitude problem. The owner stands around the counter with a clip board and serious RBF, just mean mugging her customers and staff. While I was there half the staff was talking about how excited they were to be quitting. With morale like that, no wonder they all have attitudes. 

I asked to verify that an item that was left off of my order, due to a minor allergy, (itching and hives nothing major like anaphylaxis, but I still like to avoid it if possible) and the staff member that made it said, \"I made was on the ticket, I can read.\" Which was really off-putting, you could have just said yes. I heard someone else order the same item behind me and I was returning to work in an office where I have frequent client contact so I didn't want to be itching and blotchy the rest of my day and make myself and our clients uncomfortable. Something Luna's doesn't care about. 

I would hard pass on the desserts. My best friend is a french trained pastry chef, so I tend to be pretty picky about baked goods. These were pretty generic. The frosting on their cake is way too stiff and the flavor of their baked goods is very artificial. You can tell that they are using extract instead of natural flavors. 

All in all, If you are getting it to go and don't mind paying a little extra for the convenience in a bind, I'd give it a 3.5. But I made the mistake of hanging around to eat, I would have rather eaten in my car."}
{"text":"Luna is winning. 

The eggs, as I said before, are perfect. But, there's so much more to this place!! I finally tried the crepes and they are fantastic. While they're not traditional, they have their own flavor medleys and twists that are great for stuffed and filling crepes. The roasted portabello mushroom is so full of rich flavors that I almost couldn't finish it...almost. The smoked turkey is like a perfect lunch sandwich, crepe style. 

As far as the desserts go, don't ever not get the cupcakes. Even if you're getting something else (macaroons are delicious), you'll want a cupcake later. I promise. The red velvet is delicious, but my favorite that I can't seem to pass up now is the lemon and raspberry cupcake. The raspberry icing has a great texture, albeit hard to eat daintily, and the cupcake itself has a delicious gooey lemon filling! 

Now that I'm thinking of it, I'll be having one very soon."}
{"text":"Their pastries are always on point! Their macarons are probably the best in town and they always carry seasonal flavors.

I went to brunch with a bunch of my friends and tried their turkey crepe. It was pretty decent although the tomato salsa condiment did not work that fantastically with the flavor profile of the crepe. Perhaps a serving of caramelized onion would have worked better...if only."}
{"text":"Delightful on a Friday morning. Iced chai was perfect on a sunny day. I thoroughly enjoyed my scone, not dry as I find too many places. My husband and son raved over the chocolate croissants. The tables outside were full but there was seating in a side dining room. I loved the atmosphere - tried to get my son to rent an apartment across the street so I would have an excuse to return!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for an affordable but yummy breakfast crepe! My favorite is the dark chocolate and strawberry, but the savory crepes are good as well. Had to deduct a star for the macaron though - unfortunately the ones I had were a bit hard and stale in the morning. But overall, it's a great little nook!"}
{"text":"Luna is my favorite lunch spot in the city! I LOVE the avocado toast (I get a hard boiled egg on top) and their salads. Also, TRY THE SUGAR COOKIES.
However, over the lunch hour and on Sundays it is HARD to get a table.. so get there early!"}
{"text":"After reading a review of them in the Plain Dealer, I finally decided to stop by this new bakery this evening.
We strolled in and started perusing the offerings in delight when suddenly the woman behind the counter curtly stated, \"sorry we are closed\".  
ummm, huh??? It was barely after 9pm on a Saturday night, the place was filled with people, and the doors to the place were open.  Anyway, the employee stated that they had closed and insisted that we could only buy something if we had exact change.
What a joke!  As a small business that is how you treat your customers? If you are closed, then lock your doors to incoming traffic and make it clear that you are not accepting business.  If you fail to do this, DO NOT take it out on your customers and refuse to serve them.
I was uber disappointed at Luna's lack of service since I've read so many good things about that and finally decided to make a trip out.  
Thanks, Luna, for your delicious treats but seriously, work on your service because I certainly won't be back and will be telling others about your faux pas."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderfully friendly. The facility is clean and well arranged so you're not awkwardly trying to find a place to wait (Starbucks, I'm looking at you!). 

I ordered a caramel latte which was DELICIOUS. Not too sweet and had a good milk to coffee ratio. Nothing is worse than getting a latte that tastes like sugary milk. 

I also went all out and got one of every macaron they had. My only regret is not getting more. The Bourbon Pecan was possibly the best macaron I've ever had. The salted caramel had a salted caramel pocket in the center which was a pleasant surprise. The pumpkin macaron wasn't my favorite, but was still good. Lastly, the cranberry which had a chocolate filling. Again, not my favorite, but certainly tasty."}
{"text":"Luna bakery and cafe is like a little nice bakery from Europe! (I have never been to Europe but a friend from Ireland told me about it, I am still waiting for other friends to tell me if that is true or not). I have been here only once and I like it a a lot. The location is nice, next to a parking lot. The interior is nice. The menu is limited but whatever they have is pretty good. 
I ordered one of the vegetarian sandwiches on the menu. It was very good. The staff here is very friendly and they are very helpful when you are trying to decide on what to get. I still have to try a bakery item and bread from here. If I love that, then it will be fiver star place for me."}
{"text":"Well they also had avocado toast, except the price was 1/3 of California price. It had a mild pepper kick to it but kids still loved it. 
The breakfast buritto was very cheesy and delicious.  The macaroon was yummy. Granola and berries was filling. Herb omelet panini was yummy. Coffee was tasty."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here. Luna comes up as offering gluten-free items, which is why we went there. However, we missed the window for breakfast and they would not make me a plate of scrambled eggs. The rest of my party was enjoying crepes filled with scrambled eggs, yet they would still not make it. I ordered a crepe with eggs intending to pick them out. I told the girl at the register that I didn't want ham and she said okay. When my crepe came, it had ham on it. On our way out, we saw that they offeree buckwheat crepes,  which are, in fact, gluten free. I don't know why any of the employees didn't offer this suggestion during my conversations regarding gluten free items. I'm disappointed in this place for not being more accomodating and for not knowing their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cheap, and cozy!

I thought the food portions looked small on the Yelp pictures but they're actually perfect portions for a filling breakfast without overdoing it.

I got two items because I thought one wouldn't be enough and each breakfast item was priced at $5.95 (like a half plate kind of thing). Don't do what I did! Lol. It was a little too much food.

Nest Egg:
Basically make a grilled cheese sandwich, cut out the center and fry an egg in the hole. Simple but very very yummy. Comes with a small side of salsa.

Herb Scrambled Eggs:
You can add ingredients to it for $1 more (not sure if it's per) or get it just eggs only. The Herb is cilantro, in case you're like me and don't like cilantro. I added mushrooms and bacon. You could also do ham and some other things. Comes with a side of toast, butter, jam, and salsa.

We also got their really refreshing orange juice. Good sized cups too!

Would definitely make this our go-to place in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I really love this little shop, the coffee is amazing, and the bakery items are delightful. The only downside is that I wish it was bigger, it does get a little crowded!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!...did only give 4 stars because I had a burnt cinnamon roll...highly out of character for this place. Still a delight!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a vegetable soup with side salad this morning. My husband went with the nested egg. He said it was very good but he would've been content with one piece of bread versus the two which is the usual way it is cooked. They also had gluten free peanut butter cookies sandwiches with raspberry jam or chocolate ganache."}
{"text":"I love this place for a casual Sunday Brunch.  My date ordered the Nest Egg and an iced mocha and I ordered the Herb Scrambled eggs with ham and cheddar.  The eggs came with a choice of multigrain or peasant bread.  I asked for both of course.  The cherry jelly that came with it was awesome.  My eggs were so good!  Sitting outside on the sidewalk is great.  Just a charming place.  The crepes and paninis look good.  And the pastries, scones, cupcakes, and cookies always look amazing.  I restrained myself and did not get a cookie :("}
{"text":"Great food, coffee & baked goods! Service is great, plenty of parking & food is excellent. Their nested eggs are my favorite! Perfect blend of eggs, cheese, bread & butter- also served with a pico de gallo salsa! Chocolate croissant is also amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is convenient and close to home for me, but those aren't the only reasons I return. I like it here, it's comfortable, the staff are nice, and it's a good place to meet up with friends for a quick bite or coffee.  So here's what I've had here: herb scrambled eggs, black forest ham panini, black forest ham crepe, mozarella crepe, caramelized apple crepe, cheddar and herb scone, gougere, gluten free peanut butter cookie with chocolate on the inside. almond croissant, ham and swiss croissant, and pretty much every flavor of macaroon. Wow, looking back at that, it's like I'm confessing something. This makes me sound like a huge fatty!
ANYWAY, everything is good, but I think that the non-pastry items are overpriced. The sweet crepes are the only ones that are worth the price in my opinion. Everything tastes good, I just think it should be a dollar or two less, you know? I usually just opt for a pastry and a latte, and am always satisfied."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. 
Iced Chai latte was perfect yesterday. 
We enjoyed the mushroom crepe as well as the portabello crepe.  Fresh veggies, good cheese. 
Nice patio with a good mixture of people and animals. Good wait staff. 
Bakery case looked very inviting but that will wait until next time."}
{"text":"Having come here quite a bit over the past couple years, I've recently started appreciating how fresh and flavorful the food is. I always come here for crepes, macarons, and my favorite pastry: pain aux raisin. As far as I know, Luna is the only bakery in Cleveland that makes this beautiful buttery pastry filled with golden raisins and crème pâtissière. A must try! The crepes are simple yet savory, and actually quite filling! Much like the ones in Paris. 

Luna is a great place for breakfast, lunch, or coffee with a friend. Will keep coming back as long as I'm in Cleveland. Those crepes and pastries always seem to be calling my name!"}
{"text":"I have a two part review because:
1. I hired Luna before it was a bakery and café, literally she was selling them out of her home, to make cupcakes for a friends baby shower. The owner herself (and head baker as far as I know) was more than happy to help us out and made the sweetest Peter Rabbit cupcakes and mini cake for our Momma-to-be. She even dropped them off for us. Delic.
2. Now onto the bakery and café. I think this is a place that Cleveland Heights was lacking. A simple concept. Good, quality food and ingredients with fabulous desserts. Service can be a tad slow when they are busy, but when you see the size of the kitchen they are working with to pump out all the food it really makes sense. And to be honest, I will wait an extra ten minutes for my fabulous crepe when I know I have an even more fabulous cupcake to look forward to after dinner!! Yum."}
{"text":"I love Luna Cafe. We stopped in for coffee one morning while we were waiting for another nearby restaurant to open. The space is warm and inviting, and I especially enjoyed the bulletin board with lots of interesting local community events posted (e.g. Women's beading festival?!)
My husband and I picked up two cookies, which were quite large. The chocolate chocolate chip cookie was great, but the peanut butter chocolate chip was fabulous. Will return!"}
{"text":"While looking for apartments around Cedar Fairmount, we noticed Luna Bakery Cafe open for business. We dropped in for a late brunch on a Sunday afternoon. When you first walk in, you can't help but notice the amazing assortment of delicious baked goodies. Cookies, tarts, brownies, macaroons, and cupcakes. They also have a variety of savory/sweet crepes and panini's. 

I ordered the genoa salami + mortadella panini with potato chips. My girlfriend had the sauteed mushrooms crepe. Both very good, but I really enjoyed the panini. I thought the banana peppers was a good touch. After losing a bet, I bought her a victory dessert. I can't remember exactly, but it was something like a raspberry flour-less chocolate cake. Very delicious and gluten-free. 

I would definitely go back. The location gets really good natural light and I love the outdoor seating. They offer free wi-fi as well."}
{"text":"A fantastic spot to eat and relax with friends anytime of the day! My girlfriend took me here for a late breakfast and I immediately fell in love. They have a wide array of choices and you are guaranteed to find something you'll love. 

They have an in house bakery that makes their own cookies, pastries, muffins, cakes, breads, and so much more. They also have a wide variety of drinks and specialty coffee drinks to choose from. We ordered two different crepes, one savory and one sweet. A ham, egg, and cheese crepe with American cheese, with a side of pico de gallo. Also a maple and cinnamon crepe with a side of maple syrup. To top off our meal we both had a cappuccino and it was warm and delicious with a touch of cinnamon. Both the crepes were delicious. The ham and cheese crepe was made with their whole wheat batter and I expected it to be heavy and dry, but it was just the opposite! The whole wheat crepe was deliciously moist and very filling. The crepe as a whole all went together very well and the side of pico de gallo complimented it nicely. The sweet crepe was perfectly balanced and a satisfied your sweet tooth. 

The atmosphere was very relaxed and very welcoming. There are plenty of tables and seating for large groups or plenty of chairs to sit by the fire and read a book with a nice cup of joe. I am very excited to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I love that this bakery cafe is right in my hood. Luna has a sweet vibe, super-friendly service, and delicious light meals and sweet treats at the right price. The crepes are fantastic -- I love the portabello crepe and the banana-nutella crepe -- and I'm also a fan of the Mediterranean salad with quinoa. The sweet and savory pastries on display are always fresh and satisfying: chocolate chip cookies, lemon squares, macarons, bread pudding, croissants, red velvet cupcakes... It's all so good. Luna also makes fantastic cakes to order at a great price, perfect for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast on the weekend and had a lovely time. We ordered an almond croissant, an heirloom tomato salad and herb scrambled eggs with avocado toast. The food was absolutely fantastic. 

Only a few reasons it's not a five star and none of it had to do with the food, which was awesome. They forgot our order so we had to wait a while (but they were also very busy and apologized after we asked) and they charge a random $1 for a coffee refill. Odd, but ok.

Overall, I highly recommend Luna, but go early as they get busy on the weekends and you will thoroughly enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Luna is a great place to go for lunch or just to have a sweet treat. They have a fantastic selection of baked goods including some delicious macaroons. They make crepes, salads and sandwiches. I have tried quite a few of them and have not been disappointed. 

You order from the counter then find your seat. They are pretty busy at lunch time so if you can help it, I would try to go a little earlier (around 11:00) or a little later (around 1:30). Suggestions: the Mediterranean salad (add quinoa), the portabella sandwich, the mozzarella sandwich or the tortilla soup when they have it. Great location with ample parking if you want to just run in for a cup of coffee or take out!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for lunch for a while. I made the mistake of bringing my kids with me. There are no kids options here. The eating area is not nice at all, you feel like you're sitting in a high school cafeteria. If you're dining-in, they should at least bring you water as opposed to getting it yourself with a plastic cup. Service was slow, staff wasn't that friendly. The only part of the meal that my kids enjoyed were the desserts, why wouldn't they when that's their only option. The menu is overpriced in my opinion. $35 plus tip for two sandwiches (nothing fancy, cheese in one and turkey and cheese in the other) a salad with veggies only and one can of La Croix. I am glad to see that other people enjoy it, I must be missing something!"}
{"text":"A Cleveland gem! No matter what time of the day and what day of the week, Luna is always packed. Rightfully so. This is exactly what you want from a bakery. Fabulous coffee, a beautifully arranged pastry case filled with colorful and tasty options, and a delicious selection of hot meals. I always choose a crepe. Cooked to perfection and stuffed with yummy toppings. Love the open kitchen you pass on the walk in - so clean and neatly organized and filled with pastry chefs that obviously love their jobs. This place is going to kill in Moreland Hills. Well done Luna! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious. Whether it's breakfast or lunch you can't really go wrong with any selection. Big fan of their quiche when it's available and so many of the crepes are excellent, especially the pulled pork."}
{"text":"I had heard of this little bistro/bakery from a co-worker who was extolling the viruties of their sandwiches. I always like to confirm such things, being the responsible person that I am:)

I wasn't disappointed.

Luna is set in a little corner of the plaza at Fairmount and Cedar roads. They have a really great selection of sandwiches (served toasty hot:) , breakfast foods (served before 11 am), coffee, teas, and some of the tastiest baked goods around for all palates (this includes vegan items as well:) 

Luna also does catering, not to mention that they are connected to the skills of Flour Girl, an artist  whose skills include everyting from the smallest of cookies to the most complex (not to mention beautiful) wedding cakes I've seen. Truly, this little spot has big things to offer. 

They have seating both inside and out (weather permitting) and there's lots of parking right around the corner. I think the only thing I'd like to see is MORE space, because I'd love to bring all of my friends to this place.

So, if you're in the Heights and want a tasty distraction or a quick, healthy lunch, try Luna, they'll have you over the moon:)"}
{"text":"Thanks Luna for giving me yet another reason why I need to move closer to Cleveland. 
A dangerously delicious place serving panini, crepes and mouth watering desserts. 

We stopped by because I am on the search for amazing macaroons in Cleveland. While there are not a lot, Luna is one of them. Their selection is small but still tasty. 

Today they had chocolate, salted carmel and pistachio. I loved all 3, the chocolate being my least favorite. So delicious. 

I'll be stopping back anytime I am in the area. 

Also, lots of indoor seating and outside seating as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Luna! It's located near the Daves on Cedar Fairmount. They have that coffee shop vibe for anyone who needs a place to do some work or to just read the newspaper while you order. I'd recommend this place for weekend brunch because they have an assortment of both sweet and savory crepes. My favorite is the black forest ham crepe - perfect balance of salty ham, whole grain mustard, swiss cheese, and spinach. They have a patio area to sit outside when the weather is nice - grab a seat as soon as you can because they'll get filled!"}
{"text":"Again, a 3.5 wishing review.

Luna, you have amazing coffee and croissants.  I love your croissants to be true.  The rest, eh...

I met a girlfriend w/ my beau here on a Saturday morning prior to a gig.  We were excited to try Luna due to the Yelpers who raved.  What I was met with was a crappy set-up, mediocre food, and a weird crowd to surround myself with.

We all got a cup of Joe and I enjoyed a traditional macchiato.  It was a lovely macchiato.  The beau opted for the Almond croissant, I went trad. both were delish!  The beau ordered an egg panini that came without flavor.  Seriously, eggs I make at home have great flavor, why shouldn't they when dining out?  I ordered the Greek yogurt granola and berries.  The yogurt was yummy, the berries were good, and the granola...well, missing something (flavor?).  My friend got a crepe which looked perfectly created and she seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, Luna was a disappointment.  If I lived in the area, I'd stop in for java, if it wasn't too busy, but otherwise, probably not.  

Sorry Luna lovers, I didn't see what you saw (or tasted)."}
{"text":"This is the perfect business for this location--exactly what the neighborhood needed! Their crepes & sandwiches are delicious and the atmosphere is perfect for a lazy sunday morning brunch (who am I kidding, I never make it here before noon...). 

I almost always get the crepes. If I need something hearty, the savory crepes are great -I particularly like the mozzarella & pesto one. The lemon or berry sweet crepes are also quite tasty. They have two batters -a wheat batter and a traditional one. I find that the traditional one is lighter and better with the sweet crepes, while the wheat batter adds a bit of heft to the savory crepes to make them more of a full meal.

Seating can be an issue, particularly if you come with more than 2 or three people. There's a single big table inside and they're usually pretty busy when I've been in there (Saturday & Sundays between 10AM - 2PM). During the warmer months, however, they have a nice patio area out front where they will bring you your food.

My biggest gripe is that I wish their breakfast menu was available until later in the day. They stop serving breakfast (which fortunately doesn't include their crepes) at 10AM even on weekends and I'm always never out of the house by then."}
{"text":"Love this place! A real coffee house with delicious breakfast and lunch food. Not a ton of seating indoors, but during the warmer seasons there's a large patio area in front."}
{"text":"I had my first macaroon here and I loved it! They have the perfect amount of chew and sweetness. They are definitely one of my favorite cookies. 

Another favorite is definitely the crepe cake. I've had the crepe cake by Lady M in New York (rated highly), but I think Luna's cake can definitely give Lady M a run for her money. This cake is very dense and layered with cream and chocolate. It's just an absolute experience for your mouth. 

But while I love the desserts, I'm only so-so for their savory items. They are good, but do not wow me immediately. I'll definitely be back to satisfy my sweet tooth, but for a more traditional brunch, I'll probably head to the Inn on Coventry."}
{"text":"On recommendation from a client and also from other Yelp fans, my sister and I stopped here today after hitting Coventry. My main goal was to try the Macaron. Well, I must say the orange-chocolate flavor combo was spot-on, but the consistency was only a B.  Our Portabella and Squash panini with Quinoa salad was super delish and the waitress brought it out very quickly. Some of the best cafe food I've had in a while. 

I will definitely be coming back to check out the breakfast and give the Macaron another go. I'm pretty much an equal opportunity cookie-taster."}
{"text":"Just a friendly note from a local :)  As of July 2015, summer hours for Luna as listed by Yelp are inaccurate.  Open til 8pm on Fri and Sat, open til 7pm on other days."}
{"text":"So This is my second time coming to Luna. Today I got a cold brew coffee and a salted caramel cupcake. No complaints. The salted caramel cupcake was a chocolate cupcake with salted Carmel frosting and they drizzled caramel on top. I was a big fan of the presentation. Their baked goods look so cute. The cold brew was very bold and smooth. Although I have no complaints, I didn't find anything unique in what I ordered. It was as expected. Which isn't bad, but I wouldn't give a business five stars for something I didn't find amazing. Maybe because my friends hype up Luna's so I expect more. However the staff was friendly and patient. Even if there is a line you are served pretty quickly. The place is clean. I would have liked it if there was more indoor seating but there was plenty of outdoor seating. Would I go again? Yes! Is this a go to place for me? Not quite."}
{"text":"It's great to have another go-to place in the Cleveland Heights area! It's also nice to have newer places with fresh atmosphere compared to some of the other cafes that have either an indie or older feel to them. It was a very cozy cafe--european style with a nice patio, great decor, clean interior. There's free wifi here too. I'm happy it's here in this neighborhood!

The coffee is pretty good. I had a roasted portobello crepe. The veggies were good and there was creamy goat cheese inside! It was such a nice surprise. I think the portion was definitely filling for me. 

The patio is really nice. I can't wait to come back here and meet with other friends and/or do work here.

Also.... the typography for Luna is pretty sweet. hehe."}
{"text":"I have passed by this bakery several time and never stopped. But after stopping today I will be back on a weekly basis. The crepes were amazing ( pulled pork and smoked turkey. Not pictured) and of course the desserts!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this terrific little place. Food is well made and healthy, with vegan options and a friendly staff who handle a crowd efficiently."}
{"text":"I was in town and had the pleasure to try their pistachio macaroon, salted caramel apple macaroon and their gf peanut butter and jelly sandwich cookie. Everything was delicious and I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Great food and good service, even being as busy as they were on Sunday afternoon. My kids got nutella and banana crepes and it was big enough for my 8-year old. My 11-year old thought it was ok but she loved their plain crepe better. My wife and I had their pastry, quiche and smoked turkey panini and it was pretty good. Great atmosphere, especially when you are sitting outside (be warned - outside tables get filled up really quickly during busy times). Really enjoyed our visit"}
{"text":"Visited Luna Bakery for the first time tonight.  It's a cute little bakery/restaurant in a fun part of Cleveland Heights.  They have counter service and then deliver your food to your table.  The menu is mostly paninis, sweet and savory crepes, salads, soup of the day and desserts.  I had the Mediterranean Salad.  It was wonderful!  It came with a nice dressing and a piece of crusty bread.  My friend had a Genoa Salami panini and it came with kettle fried potato chips.  She enjoyed her meal as much as me!  We ended the meal with salted carmel macaroons.  A great meal!"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap and cute local breakfast joint! The portabella crepe is so flavorful and light! All of the croissants are amazing, but be sure to ask them to toast them for you. The salads are also surprisingly big and come with a few slices of bread! My biggest advice is DO NOT get the breakfast burrito though. That is quite honestly a sad excuse for a burrito, and if that was the only thing I ate at Luna, this would be a 2 or 3 star review. The beans were still hard, and it just looked like a panini... Just stick with the crepes, bakery items, and salads! There's a lot of room inside, so if it's crowded outside there's probably still seats inside."}
{"text":"Luna is one of those places I frequent so often that I never thought about reviewing until now. I absolutely love getting brunch, catching up with friends, and catching up on some work here! :) It has a very relaxed environment and unlimited supply of free water. Just kidding ;) 

Here are some things I've tried: 
- Black forest ham crepe: my favorite crepe! I'm a huge meat lover and this crepe just does it. 
- Roasted portobello crepe: love the flavor of this one! 
- Herb scrambled eggs: not too much flavor unless you add in a bunch of veggies (and an extra $4). I don't really recommend this if it's your first time at Luna. 
- Chocolate mousse cake: wow oh wow, so rich and decadent! :) 
- Blueberry scone: chunks of blueberry! Love this one :) 
- Macarons: OH EM GEE!! Luna is my go-to place to get macaron in Cleveland! My absolute favorite flavor is the salted caramel :) I've also tried the pistachio and Mexican hot chocolate, both were pretty awesome too!  

If you're looking to get some work done here, I'd recommend charging your laptop, phone, iPad, etc. to the fullest before coming here because plugs are a scarce resource. 

Nevertheless, I definitely recommend this place with 2 thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Possibly best breakfast of my life. Whenever I want to grab breakfast with friends or family, Luna's is the first place in my mind. Thanks for a wonderful experience, and of course, delicious food."}
{"text":"Just bought the coffee cake--it's exactly what a perfect coffee cake should taste like. It was 2pm when I bought it and it was still fresh and soft. Excellent!! Honestly, I think I like it more than the double chocolate sea salt cookie that I bought which I also love."}
{"text":"Great bakery and cafe.  They have a nice selection of baked goods - when you first walk in the smell of butter is just overwhelming, but in a good way!  Their actual savory items of sandwiches and crepes and salads area also wonderful, fresh, and made to order!  I'm usually not one for non-meat dishes, but their roasted portabello crepe with roasted veggies and goat cheese was amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a brunch. I love the atmosphere there. Though famous for their cakes, their savoury crepes are good too and quite filling. Coffee is great. Service is good and friendly. Avoid peak hours. It gets crazy crowded."}
{"text":"Honestly? Unpopular opinion here amongst my Luna-crazed friends, perhaps, but I don't see what the big deal is about Luna. I think the food is good! The space is nice and inviting, and they have a cute selection of desserts. But, with most things I have tried there, I think to myself \"I could easily make this at home, and probably make it a little bit better.\" Maybe my friends don't cook as much as me? If the prices were a BIT lower I'd be happier about using it as a meet-up place more often. 

I like that Luna has crepes, both sweet and savory. That does set them apart. (Although, again, crepes aren't THAT hard to make on your own, and the ingredients they use aren't that extra-special. In my opinion.) People love the breakfast foods, but everything I've tried--ie: the herb egg panini, this morning--hasn't been nearly as flavorful as I would expect. Where were the herbs in the \"herb egg\" panini? 

Gets very busy on the weekends, but is a great place to meet up with a friend or do some work during the weekdays. They also do cakes for weddings and such."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Luna for brunch with friends or our-of-town visitors. Great pastries, eggs, and paninis, and a nice atmosphere. I don't recommend the iced coffee--very weak--but otherwise I've been happy with everything I've tried. Only four stars because it can be a little pricey."}
{"text":"Luna makes you forget that you are in Cleveland, when I came here for breakfast, I felt as if I was hanging out in DC, with the sun shining and the outdoor seating, pedestrians roaming the sidewalks and others on their bikes. I felt a sudden breeze hit my lower back, and was forced to snap out of my dream, I then realized I was still actually in Cleveland. BUT, at least I was at Luna, right? RIGHT! 

Luna is a cute little place off of Cedar Rd. and their specialty appears to be crepes. So I went ahead and obviously ordered something they are well known for. I had the Banana & Nutella crepe...

OH MY GOD... I really did not want this thing to end. I LOVEEEEE food but I haven't been this happy to eat in a long time! Despite the main ingredients being banana, and basically chocolate, it still felt light in the stomach. I wanted another but I am a responsible adult, or at least that's what I tell myself. YOU MUST ORDER THIS IF YOU COME HERE! I also had an iced caramel latte, which was pretty good, and complimented the crepe well. 

They were pretty busy but move quickly. Staff is friendly and accommodating. COME HERE AND HAVE A CREPE...YUM! 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I love the paninis here! On my last visit, I got the roasted portobella panini- it was full of veggies with the perfect tang from goat cheese- delish! And the quinoa salad that came with it was to die for. I splurged and got myself a salted caramel macaron which I would highly recommend. Only thing I got that I was less excited with was the gougere, which to be fair, was the last one in the basket and had probably been baked a few hours earlier in the day. The texture of the cheese was just a little grainy on the inside, and the texture of the bread wasn't nice and pillowy like it probably was when it was freshly baked. Even with that little hiccup, I will definitely come back for the tasty baked treats and paninis!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch after a hard night of work at the hospital. I was joined by a few friends.

First, let me say that I love the design and flow of Luna. It has a smallish front area with a counter at which you order food and the servers give you a number to sit down with so you don't have to wait for your food and clog the front of the restaurant. The seating area is around a kitty corner from the front and is filled with natural light and is quite spacious and comfortable.

When I was here, I ordered avocado toast. The food was brought to us quickly, and it was still warm. Mine was a pretty simple dish: A fresh avocado spread over a slice of toast. It was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of dishes and seemed to enjoy them quite well.

My only critique is that while Luna is reasonably priced, some of the simpler fare seems a bit expensive for what it is. This didn't detract from the food itself, and qualitatively, everything about this place is golden."}
{"text":"A colleague took me here for the first time for lunch and I was immediately in love. Not only can you order really delicious crepes, but you can watch them being made! Super impressive technique. I had the Fresh Mozzarella crepe and I wish it had been socially acceptable to order multiples because it was really great. I also treated myself to a little Root Beer Float macaroon and I really could taste root beer! Also the frosting-filling-stuff in the middle was velvety and not overly sweet. I'll be back for sure. 

Bonus: parking lot."}
{"text":"So  good, friendly, clean.  What more could u ask for.?   We had eggs, crepes and scones.....all were great and we will go back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I've been meaning to stop here for some time and I finally had the opportunity.  I stopped in on a Friday morning at approx. 8:00.  There was a steady flow of customers and a wide array of fresh baked goodies to choose from.  I opted for the ham & cheese croissant, which was not just a croissant split and filled.  The ham and cheese was baked into the most wonderfully flaky and fresh croissant that you can imagine.  I also opted for the sour cream coffee cake muffin, which was fresh, moist, completely covered in streusel and plenty of toasted pecans.   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Luna is my new favorite coffee shop and bakery on the east side. Every croissant I've tried is absolutely delicious, especially the pain au raisin! The service is fast and friendly. Coffee is dark, which is how I like it. The cupcakes are beautiful-try the lemon curd. Every experience at Luna is better than the last!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. They have a great menu selection with a wide variety of sweet and savory crepes. Their coffee isn't the best coffee I've had in Cleveland (only because there are so many great coffee shops here), but still pretty good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in Cleveland and had a crepe. Portobello crepe was delicious. Staff was friendly and lemonade was good. Cute small place. Had lemon square. AWESOME!  Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Nice bakery with decent coffee. Only rating it 3 stars due to the fact that the tables are never wiped down when I've gone in. I do like the macaroons they serve and they do sometimes put the cool latte art on their lattes. This place is usually packed with college students hanging out on the weekend mornings. Can get loud at an early time."}
{"text":"If Phoenix was my impulsive first love, then Luna is my steady, long-term relationship. It's one of the few places that can draw me out of my den on a gray, rainy day with the promise of warmth, subsistence, and caffeine. 

I didn't expect to become a resident camper at Luna because it just looks so darn cute on the outside - outside patio seating, huge windows into the bakery, the bustle of Sunday brunch - so I was all the more charmed by the discovery of very reliable Wi-Fi and their subterranean seating where I could melt into the background during (what has become many) study sessions. Perhaps the only thing missing is electrical outlets, but I suppose that's Luna's way of politely telling me that we're in an open relationship and I have to share her love with my neighbors. 

The whole air is filled with the scent of decadent sweet and savory baked goods, and maintains a cheery glow. The prices are very, very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food (blows Starbucks out of the water on all fronts), and I have yet to taste something I don't like. They even serve Mitchell's ice cream! And no minimum charge for credit card.

On any given day you'll find families, friends, study partners, solo-ers, young (they have high chairs!) and old all rubbing elbows with each other and bubbling with conversation. Because bags and bulky coats can cramp the cozy space, there's a coat rack next to the bathroom. And one of the things I appreciate the most is how organized the restroom is, and the fact that they Febreeze the (literal) crap out of the air, so it's always smelling fresh despite how many people must use it every day! They have an upstairs and downstairs service station for water, napkins, utensils, etc. which makes it convenient no matter where you sit, but yes - the waiters will bring you your food if you do have a table. 

Okay, so I might be here a little too often for my own good, and Luna may be similarly enticing for a few too many people during the weekend lunch rush, but I'll still be braving the weather and crowds for many a month to come!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 ate here on a Sunday afternoon. Breakfast choices were off the menu by noon so we chose otherwise. Not ideal for a place offering \"brunch\". Coffee and tea were poured at less than full cups. Not a big deal except refills cost extra. My son's hot cocoa was forgotten. My other son's cider was mistaken for orange juice.  We will not return."}
{"text":"A lovely brunch spot. There are a lot of options and the crepes are amazing. It gets a little hectic but that just means people really love it :) There's a cute little patio area to eat outside and a variety of baked goods, cheeses, pastries- you name it. Good coffee, too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Cleveland. There french macaroons are out if this works. They have so many different types of desserts ! Also they are famous for there different types if Crepes which are big enough for a whole meal. Another thing I would suggest is getting a cake or ordering cookies from here. Amazing !!!

Also good tip. Get there earlier if you want a good choice if desserts to take home."}
{"text":"Wonderful desserts.  Great service.  Local owner, support small business.  Server Maura is a cutie!"}
{"text":"Luna is the kind of place that you could walk in with a frown and leave with a big smile, no matter what! Between the friendly employees and the amazing food options, Luna exemplifies a high-quality breakfast nook. My personal favorite are the lemon curd crepes which are absolutely fantastic. If that isn't your style, they have more than enough tasty combinations to choose from. The pastries are also great to grab'n'go if you are in a hurry.

So if you haven't tried out Luna, make sure to do so immediately. I only wish I went sooner..."}
{"text":"This review is only for the macarons, which although aren't the best you'll ever have, are yummy and pretty and most importantly only $1.5 each!! The salted caramel and lemon raspberry are both great, although both quite strong in flavor, and the peanut butter chocolate is good but tasted more like a cookie than a macaron. 

Minor service irk -- I inquired into how they would pack my macarons and was shown a plastic takeout container, which is fine for my short walk home but would probably result in cracked macarons on a drive or longer commute. I wish they offered to pack my macarons into a cute box or at least explained the minimum order size or extra cost requirements to get macarons boxed. 

Overall, the cafe is a cute little place, and all the desserts look yummy and are very fairly priced."}
{"text":"I've been to Luna several times for brunch now, and I always enjoy going back for what I know to be a quick, tasty meal. This food here is fairly no-frills but is always very good and a great value. I enjoy their crepes and they do an excellent job of coming up with delicious and creative vegetarian options."}
{"text":"A great local little coffee shop with soup, sandwich and pastries. The coffee and tea are very good and the soups are excellent.

Parking can be a pain in the area but it is right in the middle of a huge residential area so I don't think that is a major concern for most of the customers. Where most restaurants have a small outdoor seating area, Luna has a substantial outdoor seating area that is at least as big as the indoor seating.

Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"how have i not reviewed luna yet?! this may have been one of my first stops in cleveland. friends coming into town? let's get breakfast at luna. family around? luna. the crepes are perfectly made every time. i usually get egg added if it's not already an ingredient. also, all the scones are delicious, as is the gougere. another regular for me are the macaroons and crepe cake. the chocolate croissants also out of this world. you can't go wrong with anything you order here, even just their simple scramble eggs for breakfast are delicious!
the place is also super cute and cozy to sit in and have a nice leisurely breakfast. they also have wifi if you wanna hang out and get some work done. wish they were open later in the day to do work!"}
{"text":"So I'm updating as I have been back a couple times and finally stayed and had an actual sit down meal. My mother and I came around 11am on  a Saturday and it was crazy busy! We ordered 2 1/2 soup and sandwich combos and each chose the quinoa as our additional side. I thought $9 for all that was a good deal.
-Quinoa-best part of the visit. so delicious I could eat it everyday. 
-Turkey Pannini: they got our bread wrong and the meat was a bit much 
-corn \"chowder\" was more like corn soup but not bad
-coffee was great, but was confusing about whether or not refills were allowed because looked like some people were getting them brought to the table. 
-lemon bar and lemon zucchini bread were heaven. Bread was dense, flavorful, and not sweet with a nice lemon flavored icing. Lemon bar as always was real lemon tasting and perfect distribution of crust and filling. 

I don't know if either of us would come back for breakfast/lunch/brunch. I think we may stick with the stops in for bakery items because I have never been disappointed with any bakery in this place! Or maybe come back and order something else such as the herbed eggs or a crepe since they looked amazing! P.s. friendly staff that offered suggestions and were patient with you even when the place was busy! I'll continue to frequent Luna and continue trying their amazing items."}
{"text":"Best bakery in Cleveland! The food is fresh, fast, and delicious...even better it's affordable! You must get a bakery item as well though, I love all the cupcakes"}
{"text":"Our wedding cake was truly amazing and beautiful. Luna Bakery did a wonderful job with our wedding cake and our groom's cake. Both turned out very beautiful!!!!  I would definitely recommend having them do your wedding cake as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake from Luna Bakery and it was insanely delicious!! Everyone raved about the flavor and also the decorating. Thank you Luna for making my sisters birthday extra special. It was great working with everyone at Luna, but especially with Brynn. She was very thorough when taking my order and delivered all the results I was looking for. The entire staff at Luna is really nice and the service in the cafe is fast. We will definitely be back for more cakes and cafe visits."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. If you're looking for a cozy place to meet friends in winter or a relaxing outdoor dining experience in spring, fall, or summer, Luna Bakery Cafe fits the bill. The crepes and sandwiches are healthy and delicious. The coffee is superb. And the baked goods are out of this world. I love supporting locally owned  establishments and it's my \"honor\" to patronize Luna Cafe. I hope it's around for many years to come as I plan to be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"Great (great) bakery.  Good for morning pastries.  Better for cakes (they will impress).  Coffee isn't up to the standard of the rest of the offerings, particularly the \"cold brew\" (I use quotes because it's called cold brew on the menu, but it's clearly not made in a Toddy and frequently tastes like formerly hot coffee served over ice).  Nevertheless, I return frequently."}
{"text":"Luna is a staple of the Cedar-Fairmount neighborhood, and go-to place for coffee, crepes, and pastries for all the students nearby when a drive to the West Side for brunch is just too much.

That said, every single time I've been to Luna I've been underwhelmed. The crepes are okay, but you can get much better elsewhere (e.g. West Side Market), plus they take a while to make. The quiche is actually pretty decent. However, the coffee is overpriced and pretty awful. Today, I tried their avocado toast which was *fine* and reasonably priced, but again nothing to write home about (instead go to Restore Cold Pressed for that). The lines out the door on weekend mornings are another deterrent. Even their signature cakes have not been impressive. We've ordered the red velvet cake for a friend's birthday, and it looked beautiful, but did not taste as good as a cake would have been from Dave's across the street (and you know I'm not a fan of store-bought cakes) and the price was exorbitant for what it was. Mind you, this is just one boy's opinion.

Some of my friends study here and love it, but it just doesn't do it for me. However, it is a cute and convenient place to meet up with a friend or two to chat over some breakfast food. The expansion about a year ago is well done, providing much needed seating capacity. And I must say the staff is always very friendly. Maybe all the hype about this place has led me to be a bit more critical than I normally would be, but I say skip Luna and walk to Barrio for brunch, drive down to On the Rise for baked goods, and head to Rising Star for coffee and study space."}
{"text":"There are a lot of bakeries in Cleveland that belong nowhere else. Luna is a fabulous gem that could fit right into most any major city with its menu full of fab meals and delicious pastries.

Peanut Butter Macaron? Yes please. Salted Caramel? Of course.  RHUBARB? OMG."}
{"text":"Good overall bakery cafe with yummy savory and sweet creps. Crowded on Sunday morning, but large seating area in back helped the flow.  Bakery case looked amazing, but the coffee cake muffin was a little dry. The lemon bar a bit tart, and not too sweet."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Luna's for the longest time and finally found an excuse to go on the east side of town to check this place out! 

It was a busy Sunday brunch hour when I stopped by. The first time I had a crepe was in Paris and I opted for the sweet option as that is what I associate with when the word crepe is brought up. This time, I ordered the savory Fresh Mozzarella crepe and took a seat at the side bar, waiting for my delicious crepe to be cooked up. Since the place was packed, my food took a little longer, but before I knew it, my dish was brought to my seat! 

The crepe was filled with the perfect amount of cheese, spinach, pesto and fresh cut tomatoes on the side was the perfect addition. It was so delicious and a unique concept that I will be back for a sweet crepe and coffee next time!"}
{"text":"My experience with Luna Bakery was a recent stop-over for breakfast to go.  It a small little corner bakery offering a decent list of Panini and Crepe along with coffee drinks.  Its come in order and sit down or take out kind of a bakery.  The seating area is small, with a mix of cafe tables and seating at high stools along the back wall.

I ordered the Herb scrambled egg panini with ham.  I found this sandwich unfortunately soggy.  Although it was stuffed with quite a bit of scrambled eggs, ham, and cheese,  the typical crust factor to the panini was missing.  It almost seemed that the sandwich did not have enough time in the panini grill.   I was able to customize this panini with tomato and was offered other options like pepper, etc.  I noticed however each additional item lead to an additional charge to the price of the sandwich.  

The crepe that I got with nutella and banana was actually quite nice.  The crepe was thick yet airy and the portion of nutella and banana was well balanced.  I would definitely recommend the crepe here.   As one of the reviewers pointed out before the crepe are not authentic, then again, Luna does not seem to advertise themselves as a crepery but their offering of it definitely delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, especially if you sit outside. My family and i love the chocolate croissants and they have different kinds of macarons all the time. Their portobello mushroom crepe was savory and cheesy, but some of their other crepes got a bit bland after a while."}
{"text":"They made me a ton of small cupcakes and macarons for my wife's birthday party.  It was so gosh darn good! and it was less expensive than the 2 other places that quoted me."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland on business a few weeks ago and stopped at Luna Bakery for lunch. It was super-crowded. The front area is small, so there's not much room to stand and place your order. This seems to be a very yuppy kind of place....we are more the down home type. Ordering was tedious. Food arrived slowly, but it was ok once it arrived. We won't go here again."}
{"text":"Parisian Cafe on the outside, not so much in the inside. Luna is a great addition to the neighborhood and I like its comtemporary and healthy concept. Their crepes, paninis and the whole \"natural french themed cafe\" concept is owesome.
However, truthfully the pastries and dessert are real dissappointment.
They look as french pastries but the tastes fall into an over-sweetened american. Almond croissant is my least favorite. It has a greasy syrup on top and I hope they keep their pasties less sweet, simple. And they are pricy. They have an amazing Praline scones but they are very tiny for $2.

I also hope \"Pots de creme\" can be taken home, which is a rich cholocate cream/mousse. Since they come in ceramic espresso cups, it is allowed to eat in store only. 

I kind of expected this place and the staff to be as nice as the staff in Lucky's Cafe and On the Rise but not really.

It is simply overpriced for a self claimed \"bakery\"."}
{"text":"This was a great stop for my friend and I to get some work done on a rainy day! They had an amazing variety of baked goods, breakfast items and coffee. We both had a lavender, ginger latte. The latte wasn't too strong in flavor, which was good, but I would have liked to taste a little more espresso. I had the banana and Nutella crepes, and they were amazing! The only downfall to Luna's that I ran into was the lack of outlets to charge my computer--other than that, lovely little place!"}
{"text":"GREAT for custom cakes.... delicious, reasonably priced, beautifully decorated.

As for brunch, it's very popular, but the long waits and the pricing sort of turns me off. Also.... for a cafe, you'd think they'd have more power outlets and wifi so you can sip your coffee and do work, but no."}
{"text":"Luna was one of my go-to study spots for when I have exams. Great food (it's not cheap, but I somehow would convince myself that I deserved it), great coffee, large(ish) tables, generally pretty quiet. I really like their crepes! Portion sizes are enough to keep you satisfied but not stuffed. Also, their pastries are super good too! And not too sweet. I love their scones and they also have this ginger cookie sometimes that is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's become a cleveland staple for my family. They never visit without a stop at Luna. If you go for breakfast, try the crepes! The soup also never disappoints. Great coffee, great atmosphere, and great service"}
{"text":"My biggest problem with Luna is the size, of the building. On a busy morning jammed packed window to wall, you walk in the first thing you see is a person preparing crepes. everyone waiting for a a drink, pastry, and paninis. If your lucky to get a table in this little cafe to enjoy a fresh prepared panini or crepe they are delicious. I usually go a more savory route with a crepe, a large coffee and a glass of oj. Baked good from luna are to die for!! One of the better breakfast places on this side of town. If you're in the neighborhood definitely recommend stopping in for a bite."}
{"text":"I really liked everything about Luna. I came for breakfast with a friend and got the nest egg and an iced coffee. I highly recommend the nest egg - it was the perfect breakfast! It filled me up without making me feel like I overate, and tasted great. I can't wait to come back to try their crepes and pastries!"}
{"text":"Luna is Our go to place for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dessert. The most succulent sandwiches and the nicest salads and soups. To add to the meal, the perfect sized dessert portions and great coffee. My personal favorite is House Coffee and The fresh mozzarella Panini with the Pot de Creme. Great options for vegetarians"}
{"text":"This is a very cute place to grab a coffee or a cookie. Also their brunch menu is good too! I come here to meet friends and to relax sometimes. The atmosphere is calm and low key. It's a good place to study, chit-chat with a friend and whatever you need."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to get breakfast in Cleveland. They have such a nice menu and I've never been disappointed. Their lemon squares are my favorite."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch at Luna for the sixth time in that last 6 weeks and again, our order was screwed up. We live two blocks away and this used to be our favorite Saturday or weekday lunch location. However this will be our last trip for a long while.

At least 50% or more of our orders during this time have been screwed up in a major way. The worst part about it is the staff does not seem to care. You can understand some mistakes and put up with it because the food is good, but this time the quality of the salads was miserable. My wife's Med side salad was full of lettuce cores and most was brown around the edges which means it was old. My side salad similar. This was after sending both our salads back because they were not what we ordered. 

When we shared our experience with the wait staff he just said, \"Oh really\". Going back inside to get an ice tea refill and a customer was standing there while a staff person was counting tips and ignoring her. Another finally walked up and asked if she had been helped. Oh really. 

Spend you money elsewhere."}
{"text":"A great brunch spot! Loved sitting outside while sipping on a latte! Dipped my sour cream muffin in my latte while I waited for them to bring out my avocado egg toast. My boyfriend dined on the sticky bun (to die for! He got the last one) while waiting for his Americana wrap. So fresh, light and well rounded flavors! We can't wait to returns D try something new on the menu! Every this is made on site which makes it a clear winner for us!"}
{"text":"Luna is a great little lunch/brunch spot with pretty good baked goods. Their croissants are REALLY good, as are their crepes. I love having healthy options around, and feel like they meet those needs, while also satisfying that sweet tooth! Definitely try the macaroons. As with all great things, they are usually out of my favorite thing early in the day sadly, and it can get pretty backed up at times. Really fun place though!"}
{"text":"They never disappoint. Im so happy some places still value wearing gloves while preparing your food. The workers are so friendly. Best salads and crepes ever. Spinach salad with tuna and quinoa is my fav. Mediterranean with two scoops of tuna and quinoa is my sister and moms favorite. Don't forget your lemon bar!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and scones. Brought a diabetic friend here while visiting, and they didn't have any sugar free options. Would be nice to see them add sugar free options to their syrups"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time on a Saturday morning and LOVED IT!  I had the herb scrambled eggs on multigrain Panini and my husband had a mexi scrambled egg wrap.  Both were very good!  We also split granola, fresh fruit and yogurt.  All the food was very tasty and fresh!  We will definitely be returning!  Their pastries looked amazing, although we didn't indulge it's a good excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is super awesome! But, is also a bit on the pricey side with certain items. 

Their coffee is good, but nothing amazing. Their pastries, of which I have tried a bunch of, are delicious. The caramel oat bar, gluten free chocolate peanut butter cookie, ham and cheese croissant, almond croissant, various macaroons, and cupcakes ALL taste great. I would be very surprised if somebody truly disliked any of those items. 

Their larger menu items are a bit over priced in my opinion. They have various options, almost all of which can be in a crepe or as a sandwich. Some that stand out are the pulled pork and bbq, and the goat cheese red pepper. Really fantastic tasting! Again, my only issue is that for how big they are, they are a bit over priced. They also have traditional bacon and eggs type of breakfast items. Also very good."}
{"text":"Picked up some macarons and they were so incredible! I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the pastries and to dabble in their lunch menu :) the coffee looks great as well."}
{"text":"I love Luna. They're something for everyone, while still maintaining a simple menu. I like their crêpes, the savory ones in particular, which are served with a really taste quinoa salad side. Their batter makes fluffy crêpes.

Their baked good are consistently good and offer a nice selection. The Lemon Zucchini loaf is among my favorites and you can even have them made gluten free (special order). I also really enjoy their season/ themed frosted sugar cookies, croissants, and vegan cookies and brownie bars.

I've catered with Luna many times and they're always perfect. It's very easy to work with their catering manager, Erin. See responsive, organized, and very helpful. They do a fine job with quality (even hot foods) and presentation. They're my go-to breakfast caterer in town.

My only qualm is parking. But, it's not their fault. Sometimes it gets busy and you end up needing to find parking outside of their lot/ right in front metered.

I strongly encourage you to try Luna. You'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I can't speak much about the crépe, as I've only had them once. The macarons at Luna's are to-die-for. I have had macarons from Ladureé, Bouchon, and La Maison in NYC, had macarons at my wedding from a patisserie in Chicago, and had them from Lette in Los Angeles and I still feel that the Luna macarons tops them all. Salted caramel is a staple, but where they really shine are the fruit inspired ones-lemon, passion fruit, caramel apple, you name the fruit, I've had it and every one has left me wanting to eat 12 more.  Easily the best in Cleveland, possibly the best in the US. The other desserts and especially the chocolate croissant are also up to par. A gem like this is hard to find."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The most delicious pastries in Cleveland (the croissants will make you cry), amazing breakfasts (crepes for days, egg options, granola, oatmeal), and yummy healthful lunches."}
{"text":"Great salads and healthy options...gluten free dessert options are fantastic. We were hoping for a few more gluten free food offerings but we adapted.  t's a little pricey for a group but great for an intimate lunch or afternoon coffee for two."}
{"text":"Nice lunch.  Both my smoked turkey crepe and my wife's panini were generous and tasty.  Reaching your table in the patio involves walk thru a minefield of large purses, sandbags, and misplaced chairs."}
{"text":"I ordered my daughter's baptism cake and became a lil worried when I read reviews. I picked a vanilla raspberry 2 layer cake. The buttercream frosting was delicious, I've tried a few but this was the most buttery tasting and unique. The flavor was delicious, I'd say the cake part could have been a little more moist, but it was ok. It tasted better the 2nd day. While the frosting was good, it wasn't worth what I paid and I wouldn't ever order another cake from Luna...this one cost 60 and I was charged another 10 for decorating it in polka dots, a monogram and simple fondant cross. The baker Libby suggested fondant, so not sure if that is what cost more, but most people don't even like to eat it.  Who orders a cake not decorated? I was surprised how simple and plain the cake looked for me paying extra, it looked like a kid decorated it... Nice for a change but as for Luna cakes I'm one and done. Maybe I'd try some pastry but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Good crepes, nothing blew me away. We got the turkey crepe and the Nutella banana crepe - both were tasty but I wouldn't go out of my way for them. The kind crepemaiden behind the counter suggested we add berries. We did. Good call."}
{"text":"I feel sad not giving them 5 stars. Their coffee and food is incredible. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. Unfortunately, being a coffee shop/bakery and offering zero electric outlets to your customers is unaccommodating. I work from home occasionally and was looking forward parking it at one of their tables for a few hours and getting stuff done. This is on a Monday, mind you, so 60% of their tables are vacant, so it's not like I'm hogging valuable space. If they get some outlets to accomodate their customers, 5 stars...if not, I feel like they're kicking me out after a certain amount of time, which isn't appreciated."}
{"text":"Received a \"Thank You\" box of custom designed cookies from Luna today and I am unbelievably insanely surprised at how good these are. I expected your standard cardboard cookie but when I bit into this, the icing was still soft and the cookie was soft, buttery, flaky melt in your mouth! I'm on my second one and not feeling guilty. I would recommend these cookies! I wish I lived closer to try more!"}
{"text":"The Swedish semla buns were amazing. They resemble even lighter cream puffs with an almond filling and cardamom cream. The rum cake was incredibly moist and buttery, with a delicious crumble finish on top. Definitely will be coming back to try all their other beautiful desserts!"}
{"text":"Luna Bakery is fantastic. They have amazing baked goods especially their sugar cookies. Actually all of their cookies are very good and I specially like the oatmeal and the molasses as well. They have excellent cupcakes and really good birthday cake. If you ever get a chance to try the coconut cream pie it is excellent and their breakfast is good but they have really good crepes there."}
{"text":"Everything at Luna is made in house from scratch. The pastries are to die for. Definitely would recommend for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place for breakfast or lunch.
We stayed in Tudor Arms and it took a good walk to get to this place, but we're glad we did. The taste of the food was awesome, the portions were perfect to be satisfied, but not overstuffed, the service was efficient and friendly, and the value was just right.
If we visit Cleveland again we definitely stop here."}
{"text":"THANK YOU CREPE SHOP! YUMMY YUMMY YUM YUM!
Oh--- and HELLO to LEMON MACAROON!

Be sure to get their fresh mozzarella (Panini or Crepe). I'd say to get the crepe only because you don't get to find crepe so often in Cleveland Heights. 

Oh, i've found the best dessert here. They have macaroons but they have this lemon kind flavor macaroons (it's yellow) and OMIGOSH... i've been to luna 3 times now and I can never turn it down!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review.  Luna has updated their black forest ham crepe.  The mustard is now on the crepe.  It is one of my favorite things on the menu! Luna also recently added a pulled pork crepe which is also very good.  Their salted carmel macarons are amazing!  They have expanded the seating a bit and have a great outside patio.  Luna is a must try!"}
{"text":"Quite a few crepe options have emerged I'm finding.  I'm a late adopter of this scene but I've been checking out a few. Crepes De Luxe at WSM, Le Petit Triangle in OH City, Kelly's Cafe in Brunswick (Owned by CH native), all great, but something seems so natural about Luna where it sits at the Cedar/Fairmount intersection in Cleveland Heights. There's definitely a market there, and if they could open up the storefront they would have recreated a Parisian cafe pretty authentically.

The menu goes well beyond crepes, although the crepe menu, and the ability to customize, makes it pretty lengthy itself. Add Paninis, pastries, coffees and teas, and it would be quite a while before you exhaust your options, or tire of your favorites.

And oh, this spot offers this ginger/molasses cookie that had me quoting a line from Jay & Ye's new single \"Paris\"... That *ish CRAY!"}
{"text":"Such a cute bakery in the cedar fairmont area.  I enjoyed the mushroom quiche, chai latte, and s'mores cupcake.  This is a lovely local cafe perfect to spend an afternoon reading or catching up with friends.  I really look forward to my next visit, already thinking about the next chai and pastry i'll try."}
{"text":"We are new to Cleveland and were thrilled to stumble upon this neighborhood gem. Well priced, great atmosphere and friendly service on a very busy Sunday morning. I had the breakfast panini and my husband had a black forest ham crepe - delicious. We can't wait to return for more!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for pointing out this Stellar bakery and cafe.

If I lived near here.....I would be here all the time!

Very chill place with old time exposed brick. Plenty of parking.

The menu at Luna is pretty stellar. From crepes, sandwiches, cookies, scones, and all kind of bakery goodies....all are pretty fantastic....I tried a bite of many.

Their coffee is also really really good.

Lucky you Cleveland folks!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is missing any stars. Outside of being slower at busy times (for good reason, there are only two crepe makers, it's a small mom-and-pop establishment, they're not pushy...the list goes on) there is nothing wrong with this place at all.

Actually they really are wonderful. The food (both healthy and sweet) is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. We even ordered a cake through them, which got tons of rave reviews and new fans constantly asking us \"where did you get this great cake?\" It's just a winner in my book no matter what language you read. 

The coffee isn't watered down and crappy and it's hot as all get out! I drink decaf and it tastes like the regular to my husband. Plus I don't ever feel like I got the bottom of the pot or a stale cup. 

The staff is friendly and accommodating and now after their expansion the seating area is much larger. I love it here and will always chose Luna over Starbucks across the way!"}
{"text":"I passed this cafe every day down to the Cleveland Clinic and finally made it a point to stop in. It's adorable. Limited seating which makes it very intimate and gives a small town vibe. There are definitely regulars. I parked myself at the bar seating right in front of the window and did some light people watching in between punching away on my MacBook and sipping on the best Dirty Chai (vanilla chai latte with a shot of espresso) I've ever tasted. Then the Nutella crepe came. Oh. My. Gosh. I've very selective about my crepes, once you've had one from France there's no comparison, and I have to say it was delicious. I will definitely be returning to for another dirty chai and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great cappuccinos. The savory crepes are amazing and filling. Cream of broccoli soup puts Panera to shame. Thoroughly enjoy the food and the setting every time I visit."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for breakfast/brunch/lunch on the weekend.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  The crepes are delicious and made with quality ingredients.  The coffee is great.  The atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"I love Luna.... everything about it. The food, the location, the people..... you name it. My family and I go there often and feel like it is \"our spot\".... it is great for families - kid friendly for sure. It is also a great date location."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad a couple of years ago (currently live out of state, will be moving back to the promised land in 6 weeks) and I still think about this place. SO cute and delicious. I don't remember exactly what I had, some sort of sandwich and a quinoa salad, but I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Luna. I really liked the atmosphere and the staff was super friendly. 
The prices were a bit steep and I didn't like the fact that I couldn't plug in anything. I couldn't charge my phone or my laptop. I originally wanted to come in and work in my book. But, there was nothing to charge my computer. 
We ordered our meals and coffees and they were brought out very quickly.
The Mocha was delicious and seriously just what I needed.
I ordered the turkey panini and the salad that was on special. 
Both were fantastic. I'm not normally a squash eater, but the squash, walnuts, cashews and everything else mixed with the salad was a great combo. I really couldn't tell it was squash.
The turkey panini was cooked perfectly, came out hot, with melty cheese and just tasted fresh and delicious. The chips were awesome, too!
It was a fantastic experience. I do wish I could have worked on my book and stayed a bit longer to enjoy a Danish and another cup of coffee. But, it is what it is."}
{"text":"Excellent for a casual brunch, lunch, quick pastry and coffee. The custom made cakes are BEAUTIFUL and taste divine (and I'm not a cake person!)"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Sunday Morning for a quick breakfast... and I was surprised at how fast and delicious my meal was.  

I got the Eggs in a Nest with Ham.  It was like a breakfast grilled cheese!  Mmm.  It came with a side of their homemade pico de gallo - which added a great fresh element to the sandwich.  SO GOOD.

I also got a chai tea.  Again, I was surprised at how delicious it was.  It wasn't too sweet, but had a nice balance of the spices and tea.  

I finished off my meal with my favorite thing ever. Macaroons. I want to say these were the best macaroons I have ever had. They were perfectly light and fluffy. The shell was crunchy on the outside... But the center was so moist. I got one of each of the flavors. So I have cranberry, pumpkin, snickers, and salted caramel waiting for me. 

The atmosphere is busy, but not overwhelming.  There was a constant line, but they really took care of the customers quickly.  I sat at a small table and just enjoyed people watching."}
{"text":"Ventured into Luna yesterday morning because of the reviews listed. I was met with a scowl, and the most unfriendly staff I've witnessed recently. I was 20 mins outside of the breakfast and made the mistake of trying to order a breakfast crepe. The cashier responded in the most monotone voice and annoyed face. Sheesh, I'm sorry! I actually really enjoyed the crepes, but I'll never come again."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and it doesn't disappoint.  

When you walk in, there is a wonderful display of yummy looking (and tasty!) pastries and desserts.  I've tried the nest egg for breakfast which was a great deal.  The genoa salami panini (a must for any of you meat lovers) and the sauteed mushroom crepe were also yummy.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but if you're looking for something sweet and rich try the iced chocolate, basically a hot chocolate with ice.

It can get crowded on the weekends and sometimes the service is a bit slower on weekdays when they seem to only have 2 workers. But this place has a great atmosphere and friendly staff, plus free wifi!"}
{"text":"Came to Luna for breakfast on a beautiful, sunny spring morning. I ordered the herbed scrambled eggs and avocado toast, largely based on the delicious pics posted on Yelp.

I grabbed a seat outside as Luna has a fairly large patio. Several others were seated outside as well, taking in the sunshine and sipping on coffee. My food arrived quickly and the portion size was larger than expected. 

The avocado toast was awesome. I have never had avocado toast before so can't compare it to other restaurants, but it was fresh and delicious. I added a tomato on top of the avocado toast - it was a ravishing red color and had a sweetness you don't find in grocery store tomatoes. The herbed scrambled eggs were no slouch as well although I wanted them a little fluffier.

Overall, what stands out at Luna is the high quality ingredients from the tomato to the avocados to the bread (baked in-house) as well as the relaxed patio atmosphere. Will definitively be back!"}
{"text":"Womderful.pasties and other sweets to enjoy. Great coffee and lattes along with other great breakfast items."}
{"text":"There are many reviews on here about how awesome Luna is. I totally agree. I also want to add that if you are looking for a wedding cake, this is the best tasting cake in Cleveland. They are expensive but worth every delicious bite. If you want to cut costs, opt for the cupcakes. My guests are still talking about them a year later."}
{"text":"Swoon. Nothing says perfect brunch like free wifi, piping hot, amazing coffee, a mile high scrambled egg & herb panini and Etta James blaring in my ears. Now this is how I like to start my day.

While staying at the Tudor Arms down the street, I needed a hearty morning breakfast. After busting out the Yelp app and finding that this place was only a mile away I loaded up and hustled over.

Luckily I made it just in time for breakfast because that egg panini (with swiss!! mmm) was calling my name. And only for $4.50?? ... Even better!

Although the pastry case and croissant selection made me drool, I stuck with my panini and a coffee. 

Mmmmmm - the coffee! 

I couldn't eat my panini fast enough. So fast that I burnt the roof of my mouth. Gooey cheese, flavorful eggs - get the muti grain bread for the perfect combo.

Even the small French cafe ambiance was awesome. The wired artwork in the side room is impressive. Do they sell it? Or how about telling me the artist who made it? I want one! (And the list of herbs that are in the eggs!)"}
{"text":"I am so excited that I do not have to drive to the West SIde Market for delicious crepes anymore!!! Absolutely lovely cafe with light and fresh crepes and several vegetarian options to choose from.  I also had the roasted portabello crepe, it was perfect and the price was very reasonable.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Luna is the perfect place for a relaxed coffee, lunch, or brunch. The outdoor seating is nice. Most importantly, they make their macaroons in house daily! They're delicious. Food portions are large, so I usually split a salad and sandwhich here. 

Pros: consistently good food and desserts, charming interior, friendly staff
Cons: crowded and loud on weekends"}
{"text":"Place is very good at what they do. Is it a five star place, maybe? I've been through here for lunch a couple of times now and I look forward to going back. I need to try more pastries, although the samples I have tried were delightful. Savory stuff is great. I've had crepes and a very good sandwich. I don't think you can go wrong here. Hopefully the adjacent construction is nearly finished. Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"I moved to Cleveland last spring and was SO happy to have found this place! It's a delicious gem of a bakery with yummy food, desserts, and lattes. My favorite is the turkey and cheese panini. I'm a creature of habit but finally changed it up a bit and ordered the three cheese panini. It was good, but I will say that the turkey is tastier and I'm sticking to it from now on. I've sampled the nutella crepe from my husband once, and that was also good. Their cookies are all good, but the oatmeal is my favorite. I can't wait for the weather to get warmer so we can eat outside again."}
{"text":"This place has a cute, casual vibe-- great for any time of the day. Whether a coffee break, or in between shopping, a mother/daughter or first date this is a great local cafe!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Mad Greek on a calm summer evening and stopped at Luna for dessert and coffee. The poached pear and moscarpone crepe was incredible and the cafe au lait was delicious! 

Seriously. Its a damn shame I don't live and/or work closer to this place, because I've craved it ever since this experience. 

Good work! Good food! Good coffee!"}
{"text":"Ordered a birthday cake for my daughters 1st birthday.  We requested a unique flavor (mexican hot chocolate & dulce de leche).  It was awesome! We got so many compliments on the cake at the party.  This is the place to get special occasion cakes in the heights!"}
{"text":"Portions are small but food is tasty. Their sandwiches aren't anything special but that's probably because they focus more on their desserts which are preeeeeetty dang good."}
{"text":"OMG, another Gem in the hood!!! Loving the Cedar Hill neighborhood!! I have been here several times, and now that they weather is rocking, sitting outside and mowing one of their panini's is heaven. Actually I try to take my time, but it is very hard since they are so tasty. Now if you can't do lunch, their avocado toast on whole grain with tomato's and a egg for breakfast is crazy good and pretty healthy!! My son also likes the breakfast burrito, although it doesn't really look like your traditional style it is very tasty nonetheless. Now on those rainy days it has a good size indoor seating area with cozy corners to chat or get work done. All the employees that I have interacted with there have been friendly and helpful. The salads look very good and according to my friend who mowed one himself, they are tasty as well."}
{"text":"After visiting Luna several times, I'm just not sure they have a system down. Somehow a simple order can take forever while everyone else is served around you. Maybe it works in less busy times but I've visited on weekdays and weekends, it always happens. The food isn't that great, plenty of other places that are better. I'll go there if I want a crepe but anything else is a no go in my book."}
{"text":"Cook and register lady appeared rude and unhelpful when asking about gluten free options replying with a short \"no\". When asking about an omelet, the register lady responded with a one word \"scrambled\". It's a shame the staff appear so unhappy. The decor was nice with a patio area to sit. The food? Meh. There are many better choices when it's boring scrambled eggs and an average crepe. On a positive note the americano was decent, but no non dairy options to add to coffee. Thanks Luna. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great spot for a breakfast pastry, or a nice lunch.  Patio is great and plenty of room inside.  While my heart will always lead me to On The Rise, sometimes the cafe feel of Luna is a good change.

Sandwiches are tasty, the ham and cheese croissant is pretty amazing.  Coffee is good, espresso drinks are dependent on who is working - sometimes in the morning the people working seem to be less than happy working... I get it, 7am is early - but make the best of it, put a smile on be happy.

Overall - a great please in Cleveland Heights in the wonderful Fairmount district."}
{"text":"Fabulous place! We wanted crepes and after a poor experience with buckwheat crepes (somewhere else), we were desperate to have something delicious. I did a Yelp search for crepes in the area we were at and Luna popped up. Thank heavens! We headed over and I immediately smelled something amazing being cooked up. We popped in and I saw a long line of people. I was so hungry, but it gave me time to check out the menu, which was straightforward. There were so many things I wanted to try! I saw savory crepes and jumped on a bbq pork crepe along with an iced vanilla latte and a salted caramel macaroon. The line did move fast so no qualms about that!

As you're waiting in line you can see people rushing around behind the counter and making crepes. They were all so friendly. We decided to do a to-go order because the small seating area up front was full. I saw another seating area down a few steps in the back, but I didn't go check it out. We just waited by a counter and our orders came up quick. My iced vanilla latte was on the sweeter side, but I still really enjoyed the caffeine kick it afforded me. My macaroon had a puffy shell that fell all over me and the floor when I bit into it. While I'm not really used to that, it didn't stop me from eating it up in 0.5 seconds.

The bbq pork crepe was amazing. The crepe itself was fluffy and there was a generous amount of meat loaded in there. It all came with a side of pico de gallo. My faith in crepes has been restored. My friend ordered a croissant she kindly shared with me. Oh my gosh the best croissant I've ever had! I can't even describe it! I was just overjoyed with every bite. Let me just tell you - BEST CROISSANT EVERRRRR. Ever! I want to come back and order 10 more things in one sitting. There are just so many great things on the menu I want to try. I'm coming for you Luna. Soon."}
{"text":"MACARONS!!!!!

My friend bought a whole box of them and we all tried one or two of them - since then we've kept coming back to this place.  This little bakery/cafe is simple but delicious.  Their macarons are absolutely amazing as well as the paninis and crepes.  They rotate the flavors of the macarons periodically so you'll be able to try something new each time.  Also try the mushroom crepes - you won't regret it!

P.S. They sell the french pastry (macarons), not the coconut almond cookies (macaroons)."}
{"text":"I had two hours to kill between tests at the Cleveland clinic and when that happens, I always hop on Yelp to find hidden gems and this was at the top of my finds!! This place is definitely one that I will go back to often. I got the spinach, mushroom and feta crêpe and my mom got the Nest's Egg sandwich. The crêpe is made right in front of you at the counter, which I love. The outside of the crêpe when served does not look like much at all (actually looked bland and sad LOL) but don't let that deceive you. The inside was perfection. It was fresh spinach, sautéed mushrooms and firm feta with this amazing spice blend. I think it was rosemary and thyme and it was absolutely spot on for this dish. The Nest's Egg was served on artisanal bread with ham, egg and cheese. The cut out center was served on the side like a cute mini round grilled cheese. Both dishes were served with fresh, crisp pico de gallo and it was a welcome addition to breakfast food, surprisingly! We both had the light roast coffee which was a hit. I couldn't resist myself but to take home some pastries. The crêpe pie was light, fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness. I also got the almond croissant which also wasn't too sweet, a lemon bar that had a crust of heavenly buttery amazingness and the lemon curd  was perfectly dense and very flavorful. To finish it up I had to grab two macaroons that proved that this was more than just a Cleveland side street café and is truly a geographically misplaced Parisian patisserie! Fairmount HIT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating! Cozy hometown cafe. Sensibly priced for a tasty breakfast"}
{"text":"Luna has delicious baked goods, yummy soups, and a lovely atmosphere! It can get a little crowded, but it's still a great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Luna is a cute little bakery/coffee shop with a gorgeous case of pastries and sweets, backed by an impressive menu of crepes and sandwiches. Savory or sweet, you're totally covered! Crepes are made to order and delightfully stuffed and folded with plenty of yummy combinations. And that pastry case...made it so hard to pick just one! Coffee was great as well! If I ever find myself back in Cleveland, I will pay another visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Luna - consistently delicious food in a charming cafe atmosphere. The desserts are excellent as well. Luna is one of my go-to takeout spots along with The Stone Oven. Like the Stone Oven, you can taste the homemade difference.

I also like that you can get crepes here - it's a nice change-up to the traditional sandwich/panini. Definitely check this place out if you are in Cleveland Heights!"}
{"text":"Luna Bakery Cafe is exactly that: both a bakery and a cafe. Right away in the main entrance is the bakery part; the cafe portion is to the right and down the steps.

Bakery and cafe items are good. I ordered a cookie last time I went: it was delicious. My co-workers have brought various pastry items to work: they were also delicious. I cannot comment on the sandwiches. 

The cafe itself was cozy. Look for self-seating. A quick note: if you're looking for a place to study, there's only one table near the one outlet in the cafe. Additionally, the cafe can get moderately loud, so be sure to bring a pair of headphones."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Great Atmosphere!

This place is WONDERFUL what a gem for cleveland!  Amazing pastery and food!  Chocolate chip cookies are a must!  Breakfast items are wonderful!  Service is top notch!  

I've had their lunch items, desserts and had them bake a cake for a birthday party.  Always great!

Another must try are their cupcakes.  Chocolate Salted Carmel and Red Velvet are some of my favs!  You have to go back several times to get a bit of everything!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  Lots of good food (and cookies) in a cozy cafe -- open early! 

FULL STORY:  Can't really count the number of times I've been here this year.  

Started as an early breakfast recommendation from a friend, and ended up being home base for sugar cookie orders, afternoon iced tea and emails, quick salads, special morning croissants and scones for tired groups at work......

All of the above have been good!  I don't think I've had anything here that wasn't tasty. One of the gems at Luna = the very adorable rotating designs of iced sugar cookies.  Unlike a lot of random sugar cookies you see left to last in the bottom of the box, these are pretty serious desserts -- thick and buttery, somewhere between a little soft and a little crunchy -- and really delicious!  

They usually have some kind of Ohio- or Cavs-themed designs along with the usual seasonal /  holiday-themed / random ones.  One day they had a bunch of camel-shaped cookies... (Because by Wednesday you're over the \"hump\" of the week) - hahaha.  

I really like the avocado and tomato salad... and the iced green tea.  Prices are a little bit on the high side for CLE. 

Service is a little hit-or-miss.  For the most part, it's good.  There have been a few random times it has bordered on rude or grouchy... and I've overheard some unfortunate gossiping and complaining about customers by employees in front of other customers -- eeeek.  That's more of the exception I think (hope!).

Parking used to be awesome, because they have a lot right around the corner.  Lately, the lot is PACKED since Barrio opened next door.  There are  a few metered spots you can snag if you come early or late.

Note: They can do big coffee boxes to go with cups, sugar, creamer for a group! Call and order ahead!"}
{"text":"Food is wholesome and very good. Little tight on space, but worth squeezing into. No GF bread options (although it is categorized as a GF restaurant). There are GF deserts which was a plus!"}
{"text":"Busy on Saturday morning. Muffins and omelettes were delicious and high quality coffee to go with it as well as a friendly clientele. Got great info about Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Luna as I was driving through the Cedar Fairmount area this weekend.  I stopped by to see what it was all about.  It's the perfect type of bistro for Cleveland Heights and the Cedar Fairmount area.  It's cozy and modern and appears to attract your young yuppie Cleveland Heights type folks.  (That's a good thing.)

The menu has breakfast, baked goods, paninis, and crepes among other items.  I had the smoked turkey sandwich with quinoa, which was very good.  The crepes looked delicious and range from savory to sweet selections (much like at the West Side Market).  I'm glad that now I don't have to go to the WSM to get a crepe.  Although waiting in line and getting my sandwich took a little longer than I'd like, I'm sure there will be improvements as the joint has been open less than a week now.  The place was well staffed.

The area could really benefit from more establishments like this.  I'll be looking forward to my next visit to Luna for one of their crepes."}
{"text":"Luna is a wonderful gem in the cedar hill area! I recommend this quaint cafe to anyone who is looking for a quick delicious lunch. The crepes and the panini's are equally fantastic! I recommend the Black Forest ham and egg crepe. If you are looking for something sweet you can't go wrong with a French macaron or a slice of crepe cake!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!!! Pastries are real European pastries.... service is fantastic, nothing than a warm welcome and fantastic food to get your day started"}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland when I stumbled on this gem... and it is soooooooo delicious!!!  We ordered Herb Scrambled Eggs w Mushrooms, Spinach, and Multigrain Toast.  This came with housemade blueberry preserves!!  We also got a Honey Lavendar Latté... which was amazing! 

I wish I xpukd transport this place back home .... I'd be a regular for certain."}
{"text":"I've never been in but have passed this place plenty of times. This weekend I finally stopped in and grabbed a few things to go. I got a piece of Luna cake, a chocolate chip cookie and caramel nut bar. All were really good. I highly recommend the Luna cake, which is a chocolate cake with a raspberry filling throughout. Needless to say I will be stopping in more often to try other items."}
{"text":"One word: brioche. 

This breakfast goodie is as flavorful and complex as good Italian pizza while still being light enough to pass as an acceptable breakfast choice. The mushrooms were topped with an herb mix and slathered in a mixed shredded cheese topping. My biggest pet peeve when it comes to mushrooms is their tendency to become rubbery and bland (or conversely to become slimy and mushy)...trust me these mushrooms do neither. Once you've plowed through to the center, you are rewarded with a sea of egg whites, in which is nestled a perfectly boiled egg yolk (not too dry and not too runny). DELICIOSO! 

Sorry for the blurry picture...my hands were shaking from sheer desire to dig in!"}
{"text":"Luna is good and the food is pretty consistent.   The paninis are god and the crepes are usually good depending on the person making them.  The pastries are good if you get them when they are fresh.  I'd recommend going somewhere else if you really want good pastries.  

The service here is decent but it usually lacks organization.  They don't really understand the idea of moving quickly when there is a line.   Last week when I was there at lunchtime the employees said it would be at least 15 minutes to get a simple sandwich.  That seems like a long wait for a small sandwich when you could go up the street to Panera and get something much faster."}
{"text":"I'm really glad to see this little bakery-cafe in the spot that was formerly occupied by a couple of ice cream shops, then sat empty for a while. It's a nice little location and a cute little shop.

Luna offers fresh-made crepes, paninis and baked goods, along with coffees and such. I stopped in one evening post-workout and ordered a smoked turkey panini to go. While I was waiting -- and there was a bit of a wait; even at 7:30 on a weeknight there were quite a few people trying this place out -- I ordered a couple of chocolate chip cookies to go.

The service was very friendly and while I mentioned a bit of a wait, it was reasonable, as they worked quickly and were making numerous orders for crepes from scratch.

The sandwich was mighty tasty -- spread with a smoky chipotle mayo, and accompanied by a good quinoa salad on the side.

I enjoyed the cookies later with my boyfriend and they were also tasty. Kinda thick for a bakery chocolate chip cookie, but you could tell they were made from fresh ingredients instead of plopped out of a bucket o' dough, which is cool.

The crepes looked pretty good -- I will definitely try those out in the future; the cafe also has a light breakfast menu that looks appealing. Other pastries in the case looked worth trying as well. Notable: itsy pots de cremes. I WILL BE BACK FOR THOSE.

The cafe offers seating inside and outdoors, and there is ample parking in the (free!) lot behind the building off Fairmount."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick brunch on a Sunday and really enjoyed Luna. I had a mushroom crepe that was delicious but my friend had the Nest Egg and I had total order envy. It's basically a grilled cheese with a hole cut out with an over easy egg in the middle-so good! They also had a ton of great looking pastries, macaroons, and other sweets that looked great as well. We arrived a little after 10a and the line was out the door, but it did move somewhat quickly so we weren't waiting very long. They have outdoor seating as well which is perfect on a nice day. If you're in the area you should definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to procure a cake from here...it was beautifully made as well as moist and delicious.  I was about to give up on Luna for cakes, but they have redeemed themselves!  Just order far, far in advance!"}
{"text":"So I guess I got what I wished for because since my last review of Luna I did in fact move to Cleveland and am enjoying and loving Luna! The desserts and drinks have become a regular dietary necessity now and despite Starbucks being across the street I just can't go without Luna's matcha latte. 

I'm still in love with the crepes but the cakes and cookies just round out the meal. And the decor is just so quaint you can't help but love it."}
{"text":"Great little place to get coffee and desserts. Really cozy and has several tables outside, which is great during the summer. Service was great and the coffee that I had was delicious. Going to try the panini next time I go here."}
{"text":"Luna is amazing. I love going there. The price is kinda high, but the quality of food you get is spectacular. I definitely recommend getting a slice of Luna Cake. It's layers of chocolate cake, chocolate mousse and chocolate icing, with little raspberry jam bombs. I got an iced mocha, which tasted amazing, to go with my Luna Cake. My girlfriend got a delicious iced chai and a Mushroom Crepe with Spinach and Feta. Their lines can be kinda long, but they tend to move quickly, so if you walk in to a long line, don't fret!"}
{"text":"They offer NO ELECTRICAL OUTLETS so plan your laptop outing accordingly. They make great crepes. The coffee is good. The yentas are plentiful. hence, an OK rating."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times for bfast as well as lunch. Love the fresh ingredients and the healthy options. My favorite bfast item by far is the nest egg. 
For lunch the soups of the day and crepes are great. 
Coffee is always fresh brewed and delicious. 

The desserts are just okay (don't get me wrong-I'm a sucker for just about any chocolate chip cookie), but there are much better bakeries in Cleveland that are hard to top (eg. prestis, on the rise). 
Overall I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Order a delicious crepe or sandwich at the counter and then sit out side and wait for it. Great selection of delicious looking desserts and vegetarian options. Sandwiches come with option of quinoa salad and chips. Finally, healthy, quick and inexpensive food in Cleveland that is close to my house! Panini's are $6-7, Crepes are $4-6 with cookies and desserts around $1-3.

I can't wait to return. Service was quick and prompt and special requests honored."}
{"text":"Really loved this place for brunch. 

They have a gorgeous case full of homemade pastries and desserts as soon as you walk in the door. And they're making fresh crepes at the counter just above it. I wanted to eat every macaroon.

We went with the crepe girl's recommendation (the turkey crepe with sun-dried tomato and pesto, and the banana-Nutella crepe with berries added) and we weren't disappointed. We also added a side salad (super fresh lettuce, tomatoes, feta, and a house made vinaigrette), which came with house made multigrain bread, and we split everything. It was so, so, good.

Go there. It will make you happy."}
{"text":"Since this place is highly rated, my husband and I ate there for breakfast. The woman who took our order was quite surly so we were unimpressed right away by the service. We both ordered Nutella crepes and coffee. My husband ordered a hot coffee and I ordered an iced coffee. The coffees did not taste good at all and the iced coffee did not have enough ice in it so it was not very cold. The coffee was undrinkable to us. The crepes were truly disappointing. They were not cooked as crepes are supposed to be and instead of having a golden, blistered appearance they were white and too soft, almost soggy and the crepe itself did not taste good when not covered in a lot of Nutella. Anyone that thinks these are good crepes has never had a real crepe. We will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"The customer service here is fantastic and you get your food relatively quick, that's hard to find in any food industry or at least the ones I've been too so I was very impressed. Friendly people (I even met my current boyfriend here a month ago), great location and food. 

I highly recommend the lavender honey latte even if you don't like coffee like I do I'm hooked on this stuff. You can't go wrong with anything; it's pretty pricey but I always come back here for brunch or just to study alone. Amazing, will be back tomorrow lol!"}
{"text":"Two words: PUMPKIN. MACARON.

One word: Unbelievable.

A lot more words: Luna's is one of the best bakeries and lunch spots in Cleveland. Not to mention, it's the only place I know of that makes crepes! And they taste just like the ones in Paris too. The ingredients and food are all so fresh, leading to great flavors and happy tummies. 

I've tried many, many things from Luna's. The macarons are definitely up there, although they are pretty pricey :-( But the flavors are good. I just had a pumpkin one and if you couldn't tell, they are a must! I also recently had a slice of the chocolate crepe cake. I decided to have a bite of it before dinner and guess what? Ended up devouring the whole thing. I don't know what they put in it but it is unlike anything I've ever had and it was absolutely LIFE CHANGING. I've had the sweet and savory crepes, both really great options for lunch, or any time really. I've had the muffins, the cupcakes, the cinnamon rolls, the cookies. Name and it I've probably tried it. Everything is SO FRESH and TASTY and NOM.

They are also great with events. I'm currently working with them to design a cake for a huge party I am throwing and they have been so great to work with thus far! They also catered their macarons to my friend's wedding and they were a huge hit! 

Looooooove love love"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Cleveland Heights. Very quaint and has that good neighborhood feel. This is a frequent brunch spot for my gf and me. All the paninis and crepes are great. The only advice we would give is the wait can get pretty long at times at brunch, this is not a quick spot for that."}
{"text":"Luna is spectacular. The staff are always happy and helpful and the baked goods are delicious!! Been here multiple times - it's my favorite bakery in Cleveland.

I love their chocolate croissants and ham and cheese croissants.

Prices are reasonable, the shop location and the staff are great, and the pastries are yummmm. Besides pastries, have also gotten the nest egg, mozz panini, turkey crepe, and coffee.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The idea, location and little rolling-pin logo are darling.  I have a feeling this is a 'first foray' into running a store. it's dirty job but SOMEone has to take the owner aside and mention a few good business practices:
1) Employees do not eat behind the counter.  One was stuffing her face with green macarons and the girl at the register slurping the last of her drink as she rung me up. no-no-no and no.
2) Dirty dishes should be swept away and not piled on shelves under the customer coffee prep area.  The kitchen is right around the corner; take them there.
3) For as many employees, there should be at least one working broom; the floor on the customer side of the cases was just filthy...yuk. No kidding...
4) Speaking of employees, there are too many and not well managed.  I don't know if it was scheduling of just lack of experience but I hope and wish the owner best of luck pulling this potentially cute little spot back into shape before she wonders what hit her."}
{"text":"Love this cute little place! Awesome and friendly staff with unbelievable food options!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have an alternative to Starbucks in Cleveland Heights! All of my experiences at Luna have been really positive. The baked goods are to die for, especially the croissants. Not a lot of coffee variety, but good quality. Service is friendly, helpful, and quick. I don't mind the small seating area-to me it feels cozy. I have also never had trouble finding a seat."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and sweets! Went there to do work and I was very productive (ambiance was on point!). Only sad thing is my latte had no coffee art but it was still yummy and not sweet (the way I like it)."}
{"text":"Great crepes, panini  and soups.  Top off food with oodles of delectable pastries my personal favorite.... sea salt caramel macaroons!  John and staff are helpful and friendly at Luna Bakery.

Convenient to University Circle located at top of Cedar Hill in Cleveland Heights.  I'll stop in with my office staff for a get out of the office lunch on the patio or a quick bite before a movie with my wife!"}
{"text":"Great bakery/brunch place! I got the best egg and my friend got the apple pancakes. Good service. Would like more breakfast/brunch menu options."}
{"text":"Luna is a bit of an upscale little bakery / breakfast cafe in the Cedar Fairmount area in Cleveland. I think the setting is a great place for a brunch date or a casual meetup. The bakery when you walk in has a nice selection of pastries and there is a menu above the counter to choose from for food items.

I've had both the sweet and the savory crepes here and I was not disappointed! The savory crepes always come up piping hot and have a healthy serving of meat and egg inside. The sweet crepe was OK, but not the best that I've had. I'd say you can definitely get a better crepe for a better price at West Side Market. If you're going for a nice setting, this might be a better option. 

Parking is readily available in a lot behind the restaurant and dress code is pretty casual, but I wouldn't wear athletic clothes."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Sticky Bun Bread Pudding
Almond Croissant
Cinnamon Roll
Salty Caramel Macaron, Pumpkin Spice Macaron
Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie, Ginger Chewie

Progressing down Fairmount Boulevard from On The Rise to Luna Bakery & Cafe, another Cleveland Heights Restaurant expanding on the quick, casual concept by adding Crepes, Burritos and Egg dishes to a menu of Sandwiches and Baked Goods, suffice it to say that the Eastern Suburbs are not for lack in terms of independently owned Artisan dining options.

Larger in floor-plan than the competition, the choices also more plentiful though slightly inconvenient in their low presentation along a waist-height counter where patrons are prone to stand while placing an order, it was as I waited in line that I slowly perused some two-dozen choices, the eventual selection of seven a combination of modest highs and near-misses.

Slightly less expensive than On The Rise with service just as busy and slightly more pleasant, it was with items unbagged that seats were found in a recessed dining area of white brick and wood, first bites of the Sticky Bun Bread Pudding making one wish in-house warming was an option, the chilled slab well flavored but the texture unfortunately a bit gelatinous below the lightly browned exterior ring.

Finding a Cinnamon Roll much more pleasant, the wispy curl well imbued with butter and spicy aromatics beneath a sugary shellac in place of Frosting, the Almond Croissant unfortunately took a step backward by coming across doughy and minimally filled, a far cry from the Parisian quality served at Bloom on The Square or On The Rise Artisan Bakery.

Doing better with their Macarons, the shells dainty and crackling with a good portion and texture to the fillings, Luna Bakery & Café also excels in terms of their more American Cookie choices, the Oatmeal Chocolate Chip featuring a thick, soft center while the Molasses-soaked Ginger Chewie certainly lived up to its name with bold aromatics and a sticky, melting consistency."}
{"text":"I was a little slow to join the macaroon bandwagon, but I love macaroons! Ever since I had my first bite of a Bouchon macaroon, I fell in love. 

Luna satisfies my macaroon cravings in Cleveland. They are pretty good. Not as great as Bouchon but pretty darn good. For $1.50, you get a delectable macaroon. The flavors change often, but my favorites are lemon and strawberry. They don't keep well, so be sure to enjoy them while they are still fresh (within a day).

Bonus: If you order 12 or more of any baked good, they give a 10% discount."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place since I moved to Cleveland. It's a cute little bakery with a surprising amount of seating room and a lot of metered parking out on the street for easy access.

I ordered a mocha and the dark chocolate & mixed berries crepe. The mocha was good, nice and chocolate-y but sort of lukewarm. They make everything to order, so I was a little surprised. For the crepes, they give you an option for buckwheat or traditional batter--I opted for traditional. I absolutely love crepes but I thought Luna's was just average. The dark chocolate in the crepe solidified quickly, which made for a weird consistency with the mixed berries, which were admittedly good and fresh--none of that compote/frozen fruit nonsense. The crepe itself with kind of hard and not light or fluffy like I was hoping.

They offer pastries, cookies and cakes in their case and an assortment of paninis and other crepes, both savory and sweet. It's a little pricey, and even though I didn't bring my computer, I did notice a lack of outlets. I think that's purposeful on their part--it was busy when I went at 1130am and it'd be impossible to get a table to eat at if everyone was hanging out on their computers.

In a nutshell, average and not anything really special that I'd go out of my way for again."}
{"text":"One word:  macarons!  zOMGosh, these guys make the bomb diggittest macarons that I've ever tasted.  I come here just for those even though they have some good cupcakes and other stuff too.  The macarons is where it's at!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times usually after stopping by subways next doors and picking up macarons. Macarons are definitely worth picking up especially for 1.50$ each. Really like the salter caramel ones. There were others that I liked but can't remember the flavors at the moment. Now I had bookmarked Luna as I wanted to try the crepes and crepe cake that the other reviews touted. Unfortunately, the crepes were not as flavorful as I imagined and after eating them, had a weird after taste. Maybe it's because In one visit, I ordered a savory crepe, a sweet crepe, and a crepe cake slice. Too much crepes! Will just stick to the macarons."}
{"text":"Okay I'm only going to speak for their macarons cuz that's only thing I got from Luna Cafe.

Being in Cleveland and deprived of macarons I was desperately searching for a place for decent macaroons. Each macaroons cost $1.75 and they have a few flavors to choose from. I mean this is Cleveland, so I'm pretty happy with the quality. One thing that they could improve on is to make the flavor stronger - sometimes I was not sure if I was just eating sugar or some flavored sugar of my choice."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for a more adventurous lunch than a sub place.  I've been a few times now and have enjoyed all my choices with minor reservations.  

The savory crepes are tasty, if not sometimes a bit messy.  The paninis are also tasty with wonderful bread.  The quinoa salad \"side\" they offer is good but about the same size as a free samples from Costco.

The bakery side is excellent, the cupcakes and macrons I've had were perfect, and the coffee bar offered with it is definitely up to snuff.

The atmosphere is trendy, each time I've been for lunch the place was packed and felt a bit claustrophobic, outside seating is available and preferable in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around noon and it was packed. Small place, had some seats in the back. Luckily found barstool seats.

I ordered hot chocolate, nutella and banana crepe, pumpkin macaron and another macaron (forgot what kind, something with the name salt). Hot cocoa actually wasnt that good and not warm enough. Crepe was ok, def wouldnt go back to eat crepes here. No macarons are as good as Laudree in New York. The macaron however, were suprisingly delicious, but not as soft as Laudree. Pumpkin flavor was the best. I would go back if I lived in Cleveland for their macarons and try their other pastries. For crepes, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time.. I already love it no complaints about the food i had ordered and the sweets. only I have to say is I wish they had one closer to me I am from the west side not east side."}
{"text":"Luna is the best place to find fresh baked goods in close distance to the university. Much of the campus chooses to go here for their sweet fix. My favorite is the breakfast menu and after multiple visits there hasn't been anything I didn't like.
Their crepes are cooked perfectly with a nice combination of ingredients that don't overwhelm each other and breakfast sandwiches give a good savory option if sweet in the morning isn't your thing. The croissants are perfection, especially the chocolate. The granola and yogurt is a little plain, but a good choice if you're looking for something familiar. My only complaint is sometimes if you come later in the morning the condiment stations (with honey, sugar, dishes, etc.) is a little messy and sometimes some of the options are empty/sticky. But with a busy morning where everyone wants some Luna's that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Nice location still in the heart of the Cedar/Fairmount District but off the main road as its situated last in a row of shops as you begin your way up Fairmount. 

Inside is relatively small, but there is one big table for groups. The patio is quite sizeable however for such a small cafe. And again it's off on Fairmount so better than sitting right on the main road. 

Food is light and fresh. They have a big crepe menu - one of the few (only place I can think of at the moment) to get crepes around here. They can make them dessert style or lunch style and give you a choice of wheat or regular batter. I chose wheat and ordered the smoked turkey which was served with spinach, cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. It also came with a non-spicy salsa for dipping which chunks of chopped veg. The black bean soup (of the day) was also good. No cups vs bowls, just one size but a good portion to go along with a sandwich. The soup came with some homemade bakery bread. 

Oh, and the desserts. They looked amazing, but this time I resisted."}
{"text":"Beautiful bakery selection with food options as well! They have a patio outside and a good amount of seating inside as well. The staff is very friendly and are good with suggestions, and being patient! There is parking in the back which is helpful."}
{"text":"Drove an hour to eat here, Very good desserts and delicious Crepes. Great place to get your macaron fix. The staff is very friendly and the cafe felt comfortable. Would defiantly come again !"}
{"text":"This review is only about their Bakery and my experience working with Brynn. She designed and made my friend's tennis theme birthday cake March 2015 and I couldn't be happier. The cake looked adorable and tasted marvelous! All the 10 guests loved it! Attaching pictures of the tennis themed birthday cake to show how innovative and artistic Brynn is and why I wouldn't go anywhere else for any birthday or special occasion cakes!"}
{"text":"The food, the coffee, the pastries.. all just about amazing.  They make crepes and panninis, so you can come here and camp out all day long to try and be \"productive.\"  There's plenty of great coffee and the chai latte is also great.  But best of all, the pastries.  The macaroons are yum!

Only trouble.. it's rather crowded this Sat afternoon, and if I were here with friends trying to \"work together\", it would be difficult to find a table.  But being here alone means that I get the little corner table without any difficulty.  I wish there were some lounging chairs instead of all tables/chairs.  But the lack of \"comfy\" seating areas and the crowd are the only reason for the 1 star off.  It's a little too noisy if you forget to bring headphones and try to work.  But I guess the crowd means that the locals agree... great place to start your weekend!

Tip: Definitely less crowded, and still making all the same food after 2PM.  And if you're coming here to work, charge your electronics before getting here.  They covered all the outlets in the customer dining area, so you can't plug in here.

Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist.  I guess I'll come along if someone wants to go. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
{"text":"My Crepe was awesome! Dessert even better, I had a coconut cheesecake/danish. Whatever it was it was Amazing nonetheless!

This place is comfortable, good employees, good food, but always so slammed. Its very tiny and 8-9 months out of the year, living in Cleveland, patio seating is not recommended."}
{"text":"Finally, made it to Luna's, and it was worth it.  Trendy order-at-the-counter and help-yourself cafe with nice decor, better foods, delicious pastries, and plenty of tables.  Lots of take-outs.  Was with a group of six, and found a table right away at 12:45.  Everything we ordered looked and tasted wonderfully.  Two of us got the portobello and goat cheese crepe. One friend got the Black Forest ham sandwich, another a salad with tuna fish.  All tasty.  We shared the Luna cake, a bite each, and worth it.  The coffee menu had lots of selections.  I will return."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at Luna! The herb scrambled eggs with provolone, mushrooms, and spinach were fantastic. They were timely and the the place is just cute :) Great bread, too!"}
{"text":"So, this was my first visit to this cute and quaint bakery. The staff was pretty attentive and helpful, and they had a nice selection for Monday afternoon. 

I purchased three cupcakes -apricot pistachio, red velvet, and chocolate chocolate (yes, double chocolate). The apricot pistachio was disappointing. It didn't taste like apricot or pistachio. I really can't even describe what it tasted like. The frosting tasted cream cheese based, and was a bit overpowering. It wasn't bad but it wasn't as described. The red velvet was interesting. The cake itself wasn't sweet and the frosting was very sweet, so together it worked. However, it wasn't among the better tasting red velvet cupcakes I've had. The chocolate cupcake.....was a chocolate cupcake. Nothing great or terrible about it.

I can't sing praise over the cupcakes but the staff was friendly, the place was clean, and the prices were very reasonable. I think I will give them another shot and try dome of the other things they offer."}
{"text":"Herbs, mushrooms, cheese, eggs less than $7...yes! Plus it's delicious. Will be back"}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for an order of fruit before going up to ask where it was... Check my photo for what came out. Just super disappointed because I thought I'd really like this place and will be in the area a lot more this year."}
{"text":"I mean, they already have tons of reviews, I first came across them when I worked in a restaurant and someone brought in a flour girl cake and then I saw she was with Luna later. I loved the cake so much and now I love all the stuff and love the macarons. 5 stars. Guy gave me the wrong change once and was snobby but thats ok. That food tho."}
{"text":"As competion gets higher to get people to buy coffee and a bite, more places try to create a niche.  There are coffee shop/ bakery places you go to to do work. Others where come to just talk and socialize. Luna's is small and modern and is for meeting up with an old friend or collegue to talk.   May i say also that it's efficient in getting people to stay but when it fills up its ok to get stuff to go.  Very good coffee, very good egg panni sandwich, could use a bigger space to do work and meetings and this place could out do the larger chains.  But maybe this the effect they try to achieve. Every thing is made fresh and you may have to wait a minute to get your panini.  I'll come here again."}
{"text":"Great lunch and breakfast experiences here!  Egg sandwich-wonderful, mushroom crepe-fantastic, egg in a nest- cheesy and very tasty!  Our friends bought numerous pastries that I sampled, the scones, cookies and muffins were all terrific.  Great coffee too!  Just what the area needed. Really fun to watch the bakers putting their talent to work in the big front window. We must get back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Cute little bakery and food place to relax and enjoy a nice cup of coffee and pastry. The paninis are wonderful too, as well as the crapes. Love coming here on the weekends and sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Great table service, love the look of seeing the kitchen from the sidewalk, I usually appreciate a good croissant and they hit the nail and the whole experience was great."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try all the crepes and I have to say Luna's are pretty darn good. I didn't really have much expectation for what is essentially nothing more than a coffee shop, but Luna actually has some great offerings. They do both savory and sweet crepes; I personally like mine plain Jane, but I liked that they had so many options. I was also astounded at how spacious their seating area was. The downside is that there aren't really any outlets, so it may not be the best place to get work done, but definitely great for meeting people or enjoying a book on their equally spacious patio. They also have a free parking lot on the side of the building. 
I will say that I wasn't impressed with their drip coffee. It tasted bitter to me, but it did mellow out as it cooled. Next time I might try an espresso based beverage instead. 
Overall I think Luna has a lot to offer and I would definitely return again next time I'm on the East side."}
