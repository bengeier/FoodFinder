{"text":"Food was terrible. 3 of us ordered eggs Benedict, one ordered a skillet and all was over cooked. Should have been clued in by the fact the whole place smelled like burned toast. We sent plates back, and they got one egg out of 4 poached correctly. Nothing was fresh, all processed or frozen. It was 10am on a Monday, so the place wasn't busy, but service was very slow. Service wasn't the worst, but also not even as good as mediocre. So if you like your breakfast to taste like it came from a can, then this is your place. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so cute Inside and so fun to see all the planes while you eat! This place is always so busy so expect to wait but they have a comfy waiting area with free coffee and cookies and you can watch the planes while you wait. The menu is large and priced good. The food is amazing! The staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"The Jet Room is one of our favorite breakfast spots.  It's located in the Madison Municipal Airport off I-51, which is an unassuming spot for a super cute diner.  

What we love:
- It's always clean & the food is fresh
- It's a classic diner with a wall of windows where you can watch small planes fly up, and pilots come in to grab a bite
- The O'Malley's and their staff are friendly and make you feel like family
- The food is classic diner fare with lots of fresh, lighter options
- Even if you have to wait for a table, you can lounge in the airport waiting, watching small planes come in, or you can check out historical photos and flight school rooms (neat!)

What we don't love:
- Really, nothing.  We adore this place."}
{"text":"I want to start off this review by saying that I REALLY like this place.  A lot.  It's in a cool spot (the little airport) and it is so fun to sit there and watch planes take off as you eat your food.  The staff has always been friendly and polite to me and my husband and the food is ready fast, even when the place is crowded (which is often is on the weekends).  
So why am I not giving it a higher rating?  Honestly, the food, although VERY well prepared, seems to be mostly Sysco products.  The items I am referring to specifically are things like their hash browns, french fries, bread and biscuits (I'm not sure about this, I just got the impression), bacon, sausage, etc.  It's hard for me to give a higher rating to a place that just throws stuff directly from the bag in the freezer to the grill.  Not to say that NOTHING is prepared in house, they make the eggs to order, potato pancakes and a few of the sauces.  Anyway, I do really like to eat here.  It has a great down to earth diner atmosphere.   And the food is well done (for what it is). I know we will be coming back here from time to time because it really is a lot of fun, I'm just ready to accept the quality of food for what it is."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, I had breakfast food both times. First time I had corned beef hash, which I was not a fan of. This time I had pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. The pancakes were pretty good, but the eggs were overcooked. I was a little put off by the service - the server was abrupt and seemed to want to get us out of there ASAP. The bill came with the food. It is fun to watch the planes while you're waiting for your food though."}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast here on a Tuesday afternoon. The hostess cheerfully seated us, and our server was friendly and attentive. It wasn't crowded at all, and the atmosphere was nice--open but comfortable, with lots of windows and light.

We had coffee, the Sausage Skillet, and the Southern Benedict. Coffee was run-of-the-mill, but hot & plentiful. The Sausage Skillet tried hard to be a Fair Oaks Skillet (a la Willalby's) but was half the size, $1.50 more, and the hashbrowns (like everything else) were slightly undercooked and were obviously frozen/out of a bag. The gravy on the Southern Benedict was a sickly shade of brown, and thick, but gelatinous rather than creamy. All was edible, but nothing out of the common way.

Overall not the worst experience ever, especially if you don't mind eating straight out of the Sysco truck. Probably convenient for folks using/frequenting the airfield, but not really worth driving out just to eat and watch a puddle jumper get a tune-up outside."}
{"text":"One of the better spots to grab a brunch in Madison. Views of the airport are kind of fun, and their menu (while a bit limited) has basically anything you'd want for breakfast. Nice historic background and decorated accordingly. I've had the pancakes and the French toast, both are totally worth it. Good OJ and coffee, and the sides are good too! Nothing overly fancy or exotic, just a solid breakfast joint. Can get pretty busy, so call for a reservation if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last month for a late breakfast early lunch.  Both the the food was really good and the service was excellent.  The kids really love to watch the planes come and go too."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there on a Sunday morning. The wait wasn't bad and the hostess was really organized. Once we sat down our server was friendly and quick with our drinks landfills. I got the breakfast burritos Andy friend the veggie Benedict. Both were good. The only thing we were a little disappointed about was that the hashbrowns were a little bland. They were cooked perfectly but just needed a little more flavor."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went on a weekday, it was quite crowded but Pat O'Malley was hard at work accommodating us as best he could. We sat at the bar and had a fantastic breakfast. Pat took the time to ask our names and he was always looking out for everyone on his staff. You should definitely place this restaurant on your list as a must do! Not to mention the ambiance/view is fabulous."}
{"text":"The breakfast I ordered was very good. The waitress was attentive but not hovering. I enjoyed the view of the planes. I recommend the Jet Room."}
{"text":"Great morning breakfast spot. Take the kids, they love watching the planes."}
{"text":"This place is great.  A lot of people don't know it exists, or think it's just for pilots.  The Jet Room is a diner with a great view the Wisconsin Aviation Airport runway.  

The food was decent, but I don't think anyone comes here for the food.  It's all about the view.  I had the sausage scrambler which was pretty standard.  Nothing to brag about, but it did the trick.  My gf had the salmon benedict.  It looked great and she was pretty happy with it.   

It's a busy place on the weekend but you'll be entertained while waiting for your table.   Plenty to look at."}
{"text":"When I visit my family in Madison, I always like eating here.  The food is terrific and the view of the small airplanes coming and going are fun to watch.  I usually get one of their tasty burgers.
Can't wait to return here again."}
{"text":"We ordered two salads this morning and the waitress snarled at us, took our menus and through them on the front desk behind her.  Apparently the waitresses have to make the salads. At one point she told the table next to us when they were not ready, that she would be back then as I have to go make salads.  Based on this experience I will never make another cross country flight to KMSN nor would I recommend anyone go out of their way to only to be treated so poorly."}
{"text":"You have to go in the aviation building to get to the restaurant (there aren't any signs on the outside but it's easy to get to when you go in the building). The food is good and the service is great. A lot of the tables overlook the tarmac so it would be a good place to take young kids to watch the planes. Bonus points from me for: having mixed fruit jelly, serving great coffee and serving butter that was spreadable and not completely chilled solid."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast around 9:45 AM on a Tuesday.  We were seated immediately.  Our server lacked energy and sat at the bar, eating, in between helping customers.  A different server brought us our food (after it sat, in view, under the heating lamp for several minutes while our baby was screaming for food).  The food tasted totally mediocre.  Not awesome, not terrible.  My husband had an omelette and I had a skillet.  We didn't get to see one plane, however it was a cold, wintery day with plenty of snow on the ground.  We may return in the summer just in hopes of seeing a plane go by to show our 1 year old.  The man at the cash register (seemed like the owner to me) was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  At private plane side of Madison airport. Watch Air NG jets while you enjoy really good home cookin'!  Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We were in Madison for a wedding and chose Pat O'Learys based off proximity and Yelp reviews. We were so glad we did! We liked it so much we came back the next morning. A unique dining experience being able to see all the small planes and hear the pilot talk among the patrons. And the first day we met both Pat and Pam as we were checking out, they were both so nice and shared stories with us about the small airport. The food is classic diner fare, and doesn't disappoint. Definitively recommend this place for both the food and the experience."}
{"text":"The potato pancakes were so good, I can't believe how much I ate. The portions are generous (could be concerned overly generous as they're huge) and served quickly with a smile. I went when I was exhausted and unable to make a decision on what side I should have and the server was so lovely that when I said \"surprise me\", she didn't balk and picked one for me. That impressed me so much! 

My friend's coffee cup never got empty and her food was cooked perfectly too. 

I would go here any time I'm visiting Madison!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 9:00am on July 4rth.  Hadn't had a chance to visit in many years.  Happy to find that breakfast is still taken seriously.  Wonderful food.  Had the \"Pilot\".  My wife had the special (Perch, eggs, potato pancake, toast).  Father in-law had the \"Den\".  All were healthy portioned, hot when delivered, delivered with a smile, and very tasty.  Unique setting is icing on a great tasting cake.  Thanks Pat."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Sunday brunch.  The food is really good, the staff is really friendly, and it is great fun watching the planes come and go.  Try the Salmon Omlette.  It's great!  The bathrooms are clean and spotless as well.  They even have a $100.00 burger that includes an airplane ride around Madison.  How cool is that?"}
{"text":"Classic American diner with great service and always good food. And, watching the planes go by (or the plows shovel the tarmac) is always fun!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my last visit. I had been here before and had good experience but my work/ life put them out of my way for a few years. This time I ordered the daily special walleye with pancakes and eggs over easy.
The yellow Sysco liquid grill grease diners use is nasty stuff with a rancid, artificial flavor that I find off-putting. A little bit I can tolerate. This trip, either they got a bad batch, or it was old, or they just used too much. Everything reeked of it - the fish, the eggs, the pancakes all tasted and smelled the same. Based on that trip, my rating would be 2.
I will try them again, because I don't remember that from before, and they are 'on my way',  but it's been hard to get the car to make that turn after a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. I enjoyed the view of the planes and the Benedict was pretty decent. A little bit of a wait, but nothing major."}
{"text":"Wow!  Where else can you get a breakfast with a view like small engine planes coming in and taking off? 

The menu is nothing short of a delicious surprised. 

I'm not sure if this was proper but I helped myself to coffee and cookies in the lounge waiting area as we waited for a window seat. 

The service was okay,  could have been more attentive but still friendly enough. 

I ordered the crab cake Benedict's and eee disappointed that it was imitation crab. I guess what did I expect for $9? Too good to be true. However,  the eggs were fluffy,  cooked to perfection. It came with the option of hashbrowns or fruit. 

The sausage scrabble was very well received by both parties that ordered it. Generous beef of hashbrowns were topped with diced mixes of sausage,  green peppers,  onions,  and fluffy eggs. Served with a side of toast. 

The special omelette of the day was a chili, also very well received with choice of hash browns or fruit. 

The total bill with tip was about $50. Great deal for such an memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"Hard to find a good $100 burger (airport restaurant). Had an awesome BLT with great service and an ice tea for $10.90 plus tip. Place really hops at lunch time, for good reason."}
{"text":"No wait this weekday morning. Amazing views. Salmon omelette was delicious. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Unique place that is, as Steve said, a little off the beaten path.  Pat O'Malley's Jet Room is a pretty no-frills breakfast place (they offer lunch as well) serving up some good diner grub.  Bonus feature: You can watch planes take off and land while you're chowin' down.

Out of all the diners in Madison that I've been to, the Jet Room service is the best; seriously top-notch.  Pat or his wife have been hosting every time I've gone (and have even remembered my name when I went a couple weekends in a row), the staff are friendly and always on top of things.  I get a pretty good mom 'n pop type vibe from here.

I've never had a problem with the food here.  It's solid diner food; nothing unexpected or that exciting, but always delicious.  I like it enough that it's one of the few places where I'll try to switch my order every time I head over there.  

Waits are long on weekends, so call ahead or expect to spend some time looking around the building."}
{"text":"I ordered the crab cakes egg benedict.  Absolutely delicious, only complaint is wished the outside crust of crab cake was a bit crispy.  Great view. Friendly staff. Service was quick, for being the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent food with an amazing view of the active ramp at Wisconsin Aviation!  Amazing service.  You feel like family there.  Love watching the Wis Air National Guard F16's coming and going. The $100 Hamburger is great."}
{"text":"kind of hard to get a coffee refill here. losing a star for that.

i ate a delicious breakfast skillet with bacon on it. and bacon is one of the only thing i have been able ot think about lately. the food is regular breakfast food sort of unremakable. in fact, no better than the deforest family restaurant


BUT: you can eat breakfast and watch planes take off!!1 so fun!!!! so that makes it pretty awesome."}
{"text":"What a fun breakfast spot! Lovely view and solid food w generous portions. Pat and Pam are super friendly. Read about them in a Mary Bergin book and was delighted to finally go."}
{"text":"One of our weekend favorites. The food is always consistently good.  A good array of items on the menu ranging from traditional favorites like like skillets, to the Wild Alaskan Salmon Benedict. 

We like sitting at the counter. There's often less of a wait for your seat, and by sitting there, you can see all of your food being prepared. 

I'm a little partial to the breakfast burrito and my wife really likes the veggie skillet. 

I just wish this place was a little bigger. The wait can be a little long, but one of the really neat things about this place is the view as you wait and as you eat. Lots of small private planes, often corporate jets, and occasionally a jet fighter like there was today."}
{"text":"The Jet Room is our go to place for breakfast with visiting friends.  The food of a down home diner, but with a huge wall of windows that look out onto the tarmac for WI Aviation...little commuter planes come and go while you eat some of the best breakfast around.  The pancakes are AMAZING!

Only issue is that TV is always tuned to Fox News, but on mute, so are easy to ignore.  A packed place on weekends - so call ahead for seating or get there early!"}
{"text":"We love the breakfasts at the Jet Room and our favorite waitress is Shannon. We can kid around with her and be a little sassy. Great service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend for breakfast. We were first timers, so it was a bit confusing getting to the restaurant. We sat at the counter and got to watch the cooks at work, while staring at the huge plates of food in the warming area, salivating. 

I ordered the chili cheese omelette with hash and a biscuit. OM NOM NOM!!! I would've loved a little bit more chili, but I'm certainly not complaining about anything else. The portions were very generous for the prices, and everything was absolutely delicious. Although we were facing away from the runway, the view was still pretty amazing. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive, without being overly attentive and annoying.

We will definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, come here for the experience! It's so cool to eat and sit alongside the small airport. We were staying just outside of downtown Madison since a lot of hotels were booked for CrossFit games but it worked out because Yelp led me to the Jet Room. It wasn't hard to get here but it took some time to find the entrance. Just enter the \"Wisconsin Aviation\" building and it'll be on your left.

Long story short, it's like a diner that got placed right next to the plane parking. They have bar stool seating by the kitchen and tables by the windows for families/groups. Certainly roomy enough! They have everything you can think of for brunch; we ended up getting a veggie skillet and potato pancakes. Their portions are big; we had leftovers between the two of us! All in all, a great deal and a cool experience. The day we went, it was quite cloudy and ready to rain so wasn't great for a small aircraft but hopefully your experience will involve a small craft taking off or landing :D"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place and you get a nice view of all the small airplanes. I have only ordered their breakfast, but their lunch items all look really good. The crab cake benedict is really good. All their skillets are great too."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast after dropping family at the airport fora flight. All I can say is YUM. Awesome service perfect food and good price. What more can you ask for? Probably the second best eggs Benedict (had the classic) of my life. One of the best egg poaching jobs I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Went to O'Malley's for breakfast this past Sunday. Very unique setting for a restaurant to be on the airport grounds. Decor was very cool, aircraft themed as expected and very well done. Service was excellent, our server brought coffee and juice out shortly after we were seated. I'm a coffee guy so that was nice and the coffee was very smooth. I ordered a Mexican omelet with hash browns and rye toast. The omelet was cooked perfectly as were the hash browns, browned but not crunchy. The marble rye toast (I love rye toast) was thick and delicious. Everyone in our group was very pleased. An awesome way to spend a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"A madison brunch & lunch hidden gem!

I've been visiting Pat O'Malley's Jet Room for many years now with friends and family and it's hands down one of the most unique brunch locations in Wisconsin. It's no non-sense approach to breakfast and lunch classics makes it easy for everyone - even vegetarians! There are a variety of menu items and specials that will suit any particular tastes. Service is family friendly with lots of attention to speed and detail. And the drip coffee is on par with dunkin donuts and alike! 

What really makes this place so stellar is the VIEW! Watch small planes and jets take off and land as you enjoy the friendly service and greasy-that's-the-way-i-like-it food. And where else can you enjoy the home of a $100 burger? It's a yummy burger that also includes a flight around Madison!!

If you're visiting madison or looking for a unique place to take friends/family, this is no doubt a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Cool for watching planes especially with kids!  Solid breakfast and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a cool diner!  I thought it would be a dive but the dining room has a very pleasant ambience with a wall of large picture windows making the room bright and cheery.  The old photos showing the airport through time add to the charm.  The food choices were a nice change of pace for someone coming from California.  Since I have an ongoing love affair with  hashbrowns, I ordered a side of it to go with my breakfast of perch with potato pancakes.  It was so yummy I ate it all!  Well, it was so good, my boyfriend pilfered some of each potato dish.  I highly recommend this little place because it offers a unique experience while serving quality food.  The only thing missing was seeing a jet takeoff, but I did have the opportunity to watch some small planes taxiing.  By the way, you have the option to call ahead to get a reservation.  I did so to guarantee I could try this place before hitting the road."}
{"text":"Was thrilled to see vegetarian options. Very nice restaurant, clean, fun decor. Son absolutely loved watching the planes land & take off. Best moment was seeing plane land & pilot came into diner- was very cool for him. Had California Benedict which was good not great- not best Hollandaise but wasn't expecting gourmet granted. Liked fruit cup that was offered, good variety. Average diner food but good menu options and above average atmosphere. Host was delightful but service was slow & spotty."}
{"text":"First time going with our two toddlers, who surprised me by not really caring that we could watch planes take off. I really liked my experience today. Walking in we were greeted right away, 20 minute wait on Saturday morning (not bad), waitress came within 1 minutes to get drinks. Menu is not huge but has all the basics with some surprises. We sat taking everything in, old farts up at the bar (full) and lots of older folks and families. Husband got the den and I the veggie Benedict (some reason I figured the spinach would be cooked but I still really in joyed it. Boys split 2X2X2 and loved the pancakes. Waitress checked on us couple times and our coffee was always full. The bill seemed right with what we got. This is not some cheep greasy spoon, your paying for view, good food, and hopefully a relaxing time with family."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out for a while - man, am I glad we finally did!  We took our daughter here Monday morning for some breakfast.  During the week they have a 'lite' menu that had lots of great options on it, but we came super hungry and ordered off the regular menu. I had the salmon eggs Benedict and my husband had one of their specials, the tenderloin Benedict.  My salmon Benedict was AMAZING.  Just, straight up mouth-pleasing, and I know my Benedicts (my dad has been making them weekly since I was a kid!).  The hollandaise was clearly made from scratch. We both got our hashbrowns with all the fixings - peppers, onions, and cheese.  Those did not disappoint, either.  You could taste the butter in them, and they had a very nice crunch on the outside.  My husbands Benedict was also amazing - he ordered the tenderloin medium rare and they delivered.  It was perfect and seriously melted like butter in your mouth!  We got a side of pancakes for our little one and she loved them (and so did we, she made it about 1/20 of the way through the large cakes, LOL). Our daughter loved watching the small engine planes move around on the runway outside, she was fascinated.  Fun Fact: They are the home of the $100 Burger!  a.k.a. get a plane ride over the city of Madison, come back and enjoy a burger.  We saw a few people coming back from their flights and coming inside to dine.  I will definitely going here again!!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy and the service was great. My pancake was okay but everything else was wonderful. Fun eating at a fbo"}
{"text":"The Jet Room is one of my fave breakfast spots in Madison. Classic diner-vibe with the uniqueness of being able to watch planes land/take off makes it a really fun place to bring guests! The menu has all of the breakfast classics- the eggs benny never disappoints! 

If you haven't been, I recommend coming here AT LEAST once!"}
{"text":"We waited for 40 minutes on Labor Day, but it was worth the wait! Wild Alaska salmon Benedict was awesome, esp with added fresh spinach, and you really can't beat the view of watching jets right outside of the window!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Madison. My grandma used to take me here when I was a kid, and it still brings up great feelings as an adult- very nostalgic. My husband is really into planes, and I took him here as a surprise. Needless to say he loved it! He sat and watched the planes fly in like a kid. The food is delicious as well! Great place."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food! Very reasonable also. I would highly recommend to give this place a try. I had the veggie eggs Benedict on an English muffin. Fantastic! They offer dishes like salmon omlettes, salmon eggs Benedict, etc. Very good quality for an airport diner."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff and you get to watch plans land and take off.  The food is great.  We've been here several times with our younger kids (just my husband and I and with extended family).  The wait has never been that long.  They work to get you seated as soon as possible if there is a wait.

Awesome diner food with daily specials.  Delicious, mouth watering diner food at diner prices.

They are open for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Great family friendly spot.  Also great for a quick bite on your own.  

Highly suggest checking this place out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Wow! Such friendly service and that crab cake eggs Benedict is AMAZING! Once you try this place once, you'll be back again and again ... I know I have!"}
{"text":"Not as good overall as I had expected.Pretty average basic breakfast. OK service...Enjoyed \"aviation location\"."}
{"text":"It's not the amazing gem as I was hoping, but don't let me knock it that this place is cool.

Basically, it's a diner in a commuter airport on the outskirts of Madison. If that sounds like your thing, check it out.

Food was three stars, but it was solid diner food. Prices are weird amounts like $8.54 to account for tax. Hilarious.

Gets busy on Sunday mornings!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love coming to this place for breakfast. We haven't found any better place for diner-style food in town. Be prepared to wait if you have a big group, as it's pretty busy (for good reason). Overall, solid choice for a wholesome morning."}
{"text":"Fantastic eggs benny, and being able to watch planes take off and land while you eat is a special treat!"}
{"text":"Good diner food, and great scenery of the private airport. Prices are good and good portions of food. The breakfast burrito I've enjoyed a bunch."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of eating Midwest brunches and I can tell quality vs. quantity.

My boyfriend took me here on a surprise date because he is a big fan of watching planes take off, so I thought it was novel to have brunch there.

The quality of the food blew me away as well as the friendly service. 

We ordered crab cakes benedict with hollandaise sauce and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and fruit cup OR hashbrowns).  The other reviewers down below are correct that their pancakes are TDF light airy and buttery delicious. 

The crab cakes benedicts were perfect - not too rich, and not too heavy and very nicely presented.  The waitress was a middle aged woman who was very attentive to us.

The price is also very reasonable for brunches in Madison. I would highly recommend this place, and I believe it is one of Madison's best kept secret diners.  It wasn't as cheap as the Come Back Inn located near the Essen Haus nor Plaka's Mediterranean meat intensive style brunches, however, the quality was far superior (and don't get me wrong, I adore the Come Back Inn!)

You'll also be interested in the proudly presented amateur photos of Air Force One from when President Obama visited Madison in Nov 2009, the staff were happy to give the run down of his landing at the private airstrip."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for breakfast for 2,  It is pretty classic diner.  The kitchen and waitstaff are both very efficient.  We sat at the counter and my wife said it was the best eggs benedict she'd ever had.  The wait for us was 30 minutes - apparently they take reservations too.  The scenery is general aviation.  Airplanes, airport and such.  Overall I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and super fun views of the airport watching planes land and take off. A must for the AV geeks out there."}
{"text":"Mismanaged.  Great food but they consistently run out of cinnamon rolls on Sunday. This has happened the last 3 or 4 times I've come over the past year.  Today we were 2nd table to order and the waitress casual came back and said they were out of cinnamon rolls.  Her demeanor indicates this is routine."}
{"text":"A really fun and fabulous place for breakfast. I had perch and eggs with a potato pancake this morning. Everything was well prepared and really yummy. We saw some military jets take off. Our waitress was happy and efficient. I love going there."}
{"text":"Again - thanks to tips from Yelp, my husband and I headed over to Pat O'Malley's Jet Room this past weekend for Sunday brunch. 

The restaurant is small, but popular. Expect a wait. We arrived around 10:00am and waited for about 35 minutes. Even as we left around 11, there were many people hanging out in the lobby of the Aviation building, and the crowd showed no signs of slowing! 

The food here was simple & delicious. I had a breakfast burrito which tasted fresh and was not gigantic or overwhelming as at many places. The only strange thing is that the sausage in the burrito appeared to originally have been a square patty cut into strips/chunks. Strangely enough, when I asked the waitress which dish to choose from between two, she said that she would pick something without sausage because she didn't like the kind they served there. I ordered the burrito anyhow, and I'm not disappointed that I did, even with the weird-shaped sausage.

My husband had the crab cakes benedict due to the fact that I was reading Yelp reviews to him at the table from my phone. He was not disappointed. I'm not a huge seafood fan, but even I found the meal tasty. 

We both had a side of hash browns. Mine covered in cheese, his with cheese, peppers and onions (another Yelp tip!). Both were good, but not any better than I've had at a number of breakfast places. 

While the views of the airport are good, don't expect to be seeing any large planes take off near you. It could have just been the runways they were using on the particular day we were there - but all of the commercial planes were taking off a considerable distance from the restaurant. However, right outside of the restaurant window - many private planes & jets were landing and it's fun to see if nothing else (although try not to get jealous when you see 6 well-dressed people stepping off of a gorgeous private jet). 

All in all - a fun place. Would probably not come here regularly, but certainly a great place to bring your out-of-town visitors to show them something different."}
{"text":"Unique place to catch breakfast, but if you're going on a weekend I recommend you go very early or late. The weight can be incredibly long, especially if you're looking for a table with a view of the airplanes taking off.  Basic breakfast menu, nothing complicated Or unique about the menu. Omelettes, hashbrowns, etc. it's a cute place to visit once or twice, let your kids or out-of-towners watch the planes take off, but not a place I would go more than once every couple years for two reasons: lack of creativity in menu and the lack of bar. Brunch without a mimosa is just a sad sad little breakfast."}
{"text":"Cool vibe.
Food was actually pretty good.
Prices average.
Waitress and host were very kind."}
{"text":"I have only visited for breakfast, so the five stars are just for those visits.

Fresh...sometimes it is an overused word. Freshly cooked...never frozen...fresh off the farm...etc.  When I use fresh, I am referring to \"just cooked\".  I am thinking \"not reheated\" in a microwave or under a heating lamp or cooked several hours ago.

The Jetroom breakfast is fresh.  Partially because of their volume, you can see each element of your meal, whether it be the bacon, the eggs, the pancakes, the hash browns, cooked right there in front of you. And you can taste that difference.

Now I have had the eggs cooked several ways and all worked well. A friend who prides herself on trying every Eggs Benedict in the area claims their sauce and eggs are among the best.  The bacon is cooked as I requested each time.  The pancake was yummy (official gourmet term).  The coffee was hot and plentiful.  So basically the food is great.  I need to expand my menu next time I am there.

The service is pretty darn good too!  Coffee refreshes.  

The one downside...it is very busy for weekend breakfast, so be prepared to wait.  But the waiting area is nice and has coffee."}
{"text":"Short review. One of the top five breakfast joints in Madison, and I've been to ALL of them. Excellent food and coffee, and the view isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Great diner with the added benefit of being able to see planes land and take off!

Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning. It's a bit of drive from the West Side, but worth it. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous. Service was great. Typical diner food, but all the prices are plane model numbers, which ads to the experience a bit I think.

Best part are the giant windows that let you see the private terminal tarmac of the Dane County Regional Airport. We saw three or four planes land, taxi and take off during our hour meal."}
{"text":"OK - Let's be reasonable! 
5 stars is an incredible score, but here is why I gave it.
This diner is a hidden gem. 
I mean hidden, the only reason I went was because someone told me about it. It is located in the Wisconsin Aviation building off of Stoughton Road at the end of Amelia Earhart Dr.
There are no signs outside for this restaurant.
Once inside, it is clean, tastefully decorated, awesome view of the airport, attentive service and finally awesome food. - that's 5 reasons for 5 stars.
I had crab cakes Benedict. Oh yea! That is as good as it sounds baby.
Then I upgraded my hash browns with cheese, onions, and peppers. Well worth the up charge.
It will be hard for me to pick something different from their menu when I go back, AND I WILL BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"Did you know that J. Pat O'Malley provided voice acting for many classic Disney films in the 1950s & 60s, including Alice in Wonderland, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and The Jungle Book? He was also lauded for his character acting both on the Broadway stage and American TV/film after moving from his native England.

As far as I know, the gentleman referenced above has absolutely no connection to one of the best named restaurants out there: Pat O'Malley's Jet Room. 

Any breakfast/brunch venue with a high quality skillet gets my beans a'boiling, and POMJR definitely boils my beans. Add in the potential entertainment value of witnessing airway disaster at any time and you have a recipe for a high quality morning that would make J. Pat O'Malley proud. 

Minus one star for no booze or high quality bloody (that I can recall)"}
{"text":"$100 for a burger is a GREAT deal!

The Jet Room has good food and even better service, but the star of the show is the excellent view of the runways of MSN/KMSN - Dane County Regional Airport.  

We signed ourselves for the $100 burger, which includes a 30 minute sight-seeing flight for two around Madison.  The flight is provided by Wisconsin Aviation.  

Our sandwiches were decent (not the best, but satisfying and filling) and the prices were reasonable.  The staff was very friendly.  However, the view of the runway is well worth every penny of the meal's price.  We were able to watch the 115th's F-16s take off and land and see many other neat aircraft.

Call ahead for reservations, as this place is BUSY.  We'll be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"We just happened upon this place when looking, on yelp, of course, for a lunch spot when driving through Madison!  It is right ON the runway with a wall of windows so you can watch the planes come and go; my kids absolutely LOVED this!  We even got to see a group of Air-force jets take off from the runway right in front of us.  If that is not enough, the food was really good too!  Only down side is that it is a small restaurant that looks like it is consistently in high demand, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I feel that Yelpers may have let me down on this one. There is the novelty of seeing Cessnas outside big windows, sure, but the breakfasts are standard, nothing remarkable. Hubby and I enjoyed our breakfasts just fine, and his grilled perch (summer special) was only a tad over cooked (I thought it would be super dry by the looks of it). I ordered the Flight Attendant, an omelet with spinach and sautéed mushrooms. I liked that the filling was rolled inside the eggs (and not just mixed with eggs scramble-style, which is what one usually gets in Illinois), I wish they had also sautéed the spinach-- the spinach wasn't incorporated at all, and it was weird to have whole raw, warm leaves and stems tucked inside a mushroom omelet. 

Service was good and friendly enough, but I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"We've come here a couple of times with our kids. The food is mostly uninspiring and mildly overpriced, but the kiddos just love watching the airplanes go by in front of them while they eat. They each get a little cardboard toy airplane to take home with them. The servers have always been warm, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The Jet Room is a must when in Madison. Watching planes take off and land while eating the best diner breakfast or lunch in Madison is a huge hit with adults and kids. If you go in the early morning you can also watch the Truax Fire Department Trucks circle the air field on their morning rounds. I'd highly recommend the Scramble for breakfast and the Wing Walker for lunch. I wish they were open past 2:00pm, but understand they are tailoring to a specific food type.

GO TO THE JET ROOM! That is all."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites.  I've never had a bad meal here, their breakfast food is the best and watching the small airport traffic and airplanes from their airstrip - side tables is a fun experience.  The prices are on part with the diner vibe and setup they have setup.  If you haven't traveled outside Madison for a visit, it's worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have went here twice, and the food was amazing! Our waitress was very friendly and very good  at her job. I would highly recommend to go get breakfast here because there service is great and the food is delicious!! Also everything is reasonably priced! I've had there steak and eggs, and one of there daily specials \"grilled salmon breakfast bowl\" wow, highly recommend both! The grilled salmon bowl has hashbrowns, salmon, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms and feta cheese with 2 eggs and toast for only 12.00 without tax. Like I said everything is amazing about that place! There is always a wait if you want a table but if you sit on the bar there's normally not a wait. The only thing is they don't serve alcohol. But 5 stars for pat o malleys!!"}
{"text":"Great late breakfast this Sunday morning.  Eggs and hash with a side of pancakes and I'm still full at 1:00 pm.  We had about a 30 minute wait with a 15-month-old, but seeing the planes taxiing in and out (plus cookies) made the time fly by.  Service was timely despite the full house.  Friendly staff.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"best eggs benidict in the area from the traditional to salmon ,crabcakes even vegitarian version  tenderloin special all excellent do a great job on
 all breakfast from omletes to skilets to eggs corned beef hash pancakes only had lunch here once very good burger and club sandwich kids love watching the planes come and go always have had excellent service excellent food at reasonable prices can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid with my grandparents. Even worked here for a little. The food is some of the best breakfast in madison and the quality of the product is top notch. The staff and ambiance is warm and inviting. Smiles everywhere. The owners are always hanging around to promote the team atmosphere and show they care. Hard find. If your ever looking for a great breakfast destination spot. It's here."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this place. The food, atmosphere, view, and wait staff are all awesome. Easily the best eggs Benedict I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is just another diner with good breakfast food. The real value is the view. This diner sits right along the runway of a small airport.

I ordered the Chili Cheese omelet w/ hash browns. I recommend paying the upcharge to get cheese and peppers tossed into your hash browns. 

I loved the view and would go back the next time I'm in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here on a sunny spring Saturday with our two year old. It was great! The food was tasty, the servers were kind, and the planes kept our daughter well entertained. 
Wonderful place for kids. Be prepared for a bit of a wait but know the lobby is comfortable and the kids won't get bored."}
{"text":"The jet room is our favorite place to go for breakfast when we are in Madison. It is small and very popular so there is often a short wait on the weekend. Basic breakfast fare done very well"}
{"text":"B.E.S.T. brunch in Madison. 
Brunch at airport  - \"huh\" right? Right.

The restaurant is located with in the Wisconsin Aviation building, which is across the field from where the commercial flights are housed.  You can eat the fantastic food while plane watch for your pleasure. If you haven't been here already, you're missing out - A. Lot. 

The airy pancakes that I ordered were fluffy, and really the best I've had in Madison. It sounds like a \"guilty pleasure,\" but the pancakes are truly airy that it doesn't feel heavy on the stomach after clearing the plate. The three eggs omelet was equally spectacular. Plus the solid cordial service seals the 5-stars deal.

The scene is a clean diner, but as my friend put it, \"it's an actual diner with good food, and not like the other wanna-bes.\" Absolutely correct. And there's no need to do too much flare on the decor when they got the fantastic view of the private planes against the blue sky. I will be back for more for sure! Maybe a sunset dinner for the next time?"}
{"text":"We were traveling up north from Madison on a recent weekday and wanted to grab breakfast first so we found this place on Yelp and were so glad we did!

We were greeted with a smile by the owner Pat O'Malley himself who engaged our son (2) with a smile and a 'well hello there!' and handed him a little toy airplane - a good start! We were led to a 4 top right in front of the full length windows which face the tarmac. A huge hit with the little guy! Private planes taking off and landing the whole time while we waited for food and ate make for a relatively stress-free meal with a toddler! He was entranced with all the coming and going and we really enjoyed it as well. 

The food: 
Sean tried the apple fritter french toast which was clearly made from scratch and delicious. I even liked it and I don't normally go for sweeter breakfast items - this was just right - not too rich. Coffee was above-average quality for a diner. I opted for the special perch breakfast plate combo (from scratch potato pancake, two eggs, pan fried perch filet, toast). This proved an excellent breakfast which I highly recommend! The potato pancake was delicious and not too greasy, perch was delicate and also very good. I also ordered a side of bacon which was good quality if a bit expensive.  

Kids menu: 
Several breakfast options on the 'Lil Copilot Flight Plan' kids menu. Reid loves pancakes but there was only a Mickey Mouse pancake option which came with nothing else. We opted to go with the 1x1x1 (pancake, bacon/sausage, egg) off the regular menu which ended up being quite a bit cheaper than getting two of the kids options (one pancake and one kid combo plate). Overall though the kids menu is very adequate and all options below $5. 

Scenery: 5 stars (7 stars from toddler perspective :)
Food: 4-5 stars. 
Service 4 stars - quick and efficient, coffee cups never empty
Price: 3 stars - $40 is a bit of a stretch for breakfast for two adults and a toddler, but for a special treat it is ok. Over 4 dollars for a side of bacon is a bit much as well. 

Overall, very satisfied and we'll be back if we have the opportunity. Check it out for a special day with the kids or otherwise!"}
{"text":"If you like airplanes and food...this is your place.  I stopped in for breakfast on a cold and icy December day. There wasn't much airplane activity, but several planes were moving around.  The wall of windows provide ample viewing of any ground activity at Wisconsin Aviation.  

Now the food.  I ordered the 2+2+2 which was 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 pieces of sausage.  The pancakes were huge and consumed the plate.  The eggs and sausage came on another plate.  The food was very good.

My ticket was $12.24 before tip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. 
It's quick (once you're seated).
It's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).
It's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).
It's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).
Is it super local? Super sustainable?
No.
It's a diner. 
But a delicious one.
And there are planes!"}
{"text":"Newer diner (was expecting older), great service with a neat view.  Food was very delicious but it's hard to swallow the price tags.  $9.50 for a BLT sandwich?  I guess you're paying for the view, which is kind of cool but I'd rather not pay double.  

Was passing through - I live in Chicago where I understand establishments charge $$$ when dining out, but didn't think I'd see it in Wisconsin.  I recommend you Eat there once when you're don't mind paying more then you should.  We loved all the old pics on the wall and the original \"Restaurant\" neon sign hanging from the original diner that was once there.

Oh and Shannon gave us excellent service!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a surprise. We flew into Madison and were starving. We always rely on Yelp when we travel, it was close and this place did not disappoint. It is inside a flight services building but the place is really clean and a nice view of the runway.I had the BLTCE and my wife had the flying fish sandwich and both were really good. We will be back, check it out."}
{"text":"After an early round of golf, we had some time to kill.  We had heard about the Jet Room, and we were close, so it was time to see what all the buzz was about.

If you like airplanes, this is a place to check out.  It's at the Madison airport (business side, not the main terminal).  The restaurant overlooks the business jet tarmac.  While eating, you can watch folks exit their small planes and jets and wonder what kind of exciting day they have in front of them.

The restaurant is very clean and well kept.  It's got an old fashioned feel with not only tables, but a bar counter that overlooks the grill.  The service was very friendly and their attention to detail was great.  The food was very good.  They'll serve you breakfast or dinner anytime.  I was in the mood for eggs, so I got the eggs & hashbrowns platter with some wheat toast.  The eggs were over-easy - perfectly done.  If you don't like really runny yokes, make sure you order over-medium!  The hashbrowns had a nice crunchy outside with a hot, soft inside.  Very tasty - all of it.  My friends got a tuna melt and a bacon cheeseburger.  You can choose from sides like broccoli, fresh fruit (cut that morning, we were told), fries, and deep-fried potato chips.  It all sounded great.  The bacon cheeseburger was ordered medium rare, but it wasn't really even pink inside, but he did say it was pretty excellent, so all was forgiven.

Prices were decent.  Breakfast dishes ranged from $6.48 to over $11.  Most burgers were $8 to $10. 

I don't get out to the airport often, but knowing this little gem is out there, I'll keep it on my short list!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places for breakfast. Try to go on a weekday or prepare to wait--but the wait is worth it. Good food and terrific, old fashioned service. Your coffee is never empty."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and I like planes. A little off the beaten track but it's worth the trek."}
{"text":"-Great Crab Cakes Benedict
-Consistently friendly & accommodating staff
-Clean, bright atmosphere in this aviation-themed diner
-Great view of the smaller aircraft flying in and out of the airport
-Fun for the kiddos! 
-They take reservations-yessss  I hate waiting around but if you do, their waiting room is very comfortable and spacious with the same busteling airport view.
-Straight-forward menu, but they put a unique twist on their entrees so it's not boring"}
{"text":"\"B-B-B-Bennie!\" Sorry, couldn't resist. 
But really this place is great and deserves the shoutin'.
Where else can you enjoy a yummy breakfast while watching planes land and take off?? Nowhere. Nowhere if not for Pat O Malley's. Nope.

Anyways, as we were sipping on our coffees and enjoying the glorious views, we ordered:

*Tenderloin steak and eggs with hashbrowns 
*Co-pilot - three egg omelet w. diced ham, american cheese & cheesy hashbrowns 
*Flight Attendant - three egg omelet w. fresh spinach, sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese
*The Yoke and Rudder - 2 sunny up eggs and bacon

All the meals hit the spot. Delish. 

But Pat's also has tasty English muffins and BISCUITS!!!! (my current obsession)

\"B-B-B-Biscuits!\" Yesssss"}
{"text":"First off the view is outstanding.  O'Malley's is right off the runway at the Madison Airport.  The waitstaff is very good,  and the food as well.  There can be a wait so do not expect to get in an  out very fast.  I recommend trying the Jet Room."}
{"text":"I agree the crab cake Benedict are delicious. Who gets big crab cakes for $9.99 with hashbrowns?!! For what you get, including the cool view, the price was worth it. Our server was also great.  She brought out pancakes with a candle on top because we were celebrating a little one's birthday."}
{"text":"Great selection of salads and sandwiches. Cool atmosphere right in the airport. Service was fast and courteous. We'd definitely go back if we're  in the area."}
{"text":"Classic diner in an unexpected setting. A nice place to have in your back pocket for breakfast as it's unbeknownst to most locals. Great eggs Benedict and sausage skillet. Portions are eatable, not outrageously huge but enough to pig out on."}
{"text":"very good food.  excellent service!  eggs benedict is the specialty here and it's excellent.  decent coffee and a great view of the tarmac, right outside the window."}
