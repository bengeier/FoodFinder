{"text":"Not even joking, Asian Rice Bowl is one of the best Chinese food places in Pittsburgh.  Ok, so you can get better crab Rangoons, soups and egg rolls other places for absolutely sure.  But if you're like me and are down for some good ole Americanized Kitty & Rice, you're in for a treat.   Literally the only reason I visit Century III mall, besides for shoes. (C3 has lots of shoe stores, Champs, Finish Line, and I usually get my kicks at Footaction. I think there's still a Footlocker too if you're looking for non-slips.)  I always get the 2-item deal, bourbon chicken is a must on any given day, then I choose between Teriyaki & General Tsao's.  Their fried rice ain't bad, but I love their lo mein.   Check it out if you haven't. It may just be Mall Food, but it's one of the very few Asian places that doesn't make me crap my brains out afterward, so just going by that it's worth a try for anyone."}
{"text":"After a further survey of Chinese restaurants in the South Hills area, I now have no trouble declaring that Asian Rice Bowl is among the best there is.  I'm also delighted to report that they have a SUPER SECRET MENU ITEM for the regulars: a Singapore Noodle that has to be the very best I've ever had.  The noodles manage to be tender AND crisp at the same time, with devastatingly good (and somehow subtle) curry flavor.  I also had an extended conversation with the chef about the way they make their chicken-on-a-stick.  It turns out that he's incredibly passionate about making food \"the right way\" (his words, not mine) -- very particular about the ingredients he uses, and about the way seasonings are laid down.  And this passion shows in all the food; this, then, is the reason why it would be insulting to call his food \"food court Chinese\".  Seriously, this guy rocks wok hei in a way that I've only rarely seen.  When I stop to reflect, it all makes sense.  He cooks the food, right in front of you.  You eat it hot off the wok.  Chinese food is supposed to be eaten that way; that's why some of the best-tasting food in China can be found made by street vendors.  Most Chinese restaurants are sit-down affairs, and there's this necessarily relatively long delay between the time the food is cooked and the time it reaches your table.  Not here.  And that's what keeps bringing me back for more and more and more.  I revise my earlier judgment: come here if you love eating Chinese food ... whether you happen to be at Century III Mall already or not.  Your taste buds will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Asian food eater, but I was completely blown away the first time I ate here, and every other time after that! Sometimes I stop there for a quick snack if I'm in the mall, which is usually just the chicken on a stick with some white rice, and even that is absolutely amazing! This is definitely some of the best Asian food in the area. I recommend stopping in the mall simply to get their food."}
