{"text":"This was awesome! The noodle soup is so delicious and it definitely was the best I was ever had! Recommend without any hesitation!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is also a bar!! They make the BEST spiked iced cappuccino! You can request what and how you want your drink made too! Friendly bar tender. Place is clean and apparently their dumplings are to die for.   I think this place is a hidden gem. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Grimy looking from the outside but very clean and cozy on the inside.  Confusing to find as the sign is still from the old tavern however its right on the corner of Jean Talon and Stuart.  Ordered the 15 piece pork, shrimp n chive and 15 piece goat curry.  Never had goat in a dumpling before and was not disappointed, very delicious and very fresh.  All made on site no frozen dumplings here.  Very affordable prices with the exception of the drinks, a beer and a scotch almost cost half of what the food did.  Other than that I tip my hat to this hidden gem and highly recommend it for those of you who love dumplings, I will for sure be going back again."}
{"text":"I'm scared of this place blowing up because it is still below the radar of awesome dumplings in this city but hell, here goes nothing...  My boyfriend and I came here last Friday night. We were a whopping 8 people in the restaurant eating (according to the server, he said this was a rush), not counting those that were playing on the lottery terminals. Yes. They have lottery machines. What a bonus to those who enjoy these things.   Unfortunately, the vegetarian options weren't huge but I had the cabbage and mushroom dumplings and they were delicious. My boyfriend had the pork and chive dumplings and he kept telling me how much it sucked I didn't eat meat to taste these little dumplings so I assume they were good. We split a seaweed salad also that was really tasty.   The best part was the booth we were sitting in, a big U shape that belonged with Grey Goose bottle service. Unfortunately, we don't like Grey Goose (and I doubt they do bottle service, although they are licensed and from what I could tell had all the basics) but the vibe was fun nonetheless.   This place competes with Qing Hua Dumpling on ave Lincoln. I recommend it to anyone that loves dumplings or cheesy deserted bars with lottery terminals."}
{"text":"Very fresh dumplings. I had steamed dumplings (half porc & shrimp, and the other half nappa cabbage & mushrooms). I preferred the porc & shrimp.  There were 15 in total.  Then I ordered fried dumplings (half chicken & coriander, half pork & mushrooms). They were also very good. But I preferred the steamed ones. See attached pictures.   This place is a bar. I was alone here on a Halloween night, waiting for some friends to get ready to go for a party. On the back, there were a couple of video lottery machines, with some old ladies playing quietly non stop. It was a weird place. I felt like in a movie. Loved it."}
{"text":"Pas très bon! Dumpling goûtent le congelé! Gens étrange qui jouent aux machines vidéo... Deux seuls clients... Nous..."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 20.  I don't think they believed me when I called to reserve.  The dumplings were amazing.  Fresh and very good!  I also had the Seaweed salad, enjoyed the texture in my mouth.  Found it very good.  I some members that tried the other salad with noodles and veggies and they claimed it was excellent.  We were the only people in the place on a Saturday night.    We had five tables and only the last table to be served were not completely satisfied with their dumplings since the owner didn't prepare enough in advance and took some out of the freezer.  The last table were not as satisfied or lucky as the other four tables but still very good.   This is a great place for Dumpling Lovers!"}
{"text":"Wow dumplings in Park-ex!!! thats great. They were not that bad either. I loved the lamb. Just like china. But the curry chicken was a little strange for me. I gave it a try but felt it did not taste chinese enough. Still 4 stars as everything else was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. As good as Qing hua down on saint Laurent or on Lincoln. Had the veggie dumplings, made fresh, juicy, quick! Place has slot machines, just in case you're in the mood!"}
