{"text":"Came here the other day to grab a quick lunch with a friend. We both got the margherita pizza, their standard with basil, tomato sauce and mozzarella. I definitely like the vibe of this place, staff were friendly and efficient. Everything is freshly made and you watch them as they p bake your pizza in an oven.

My pizza was a bit burnt, but otherwise very tasty! I liked the texture of the dough and the thinness of the main part of the pizza, while the crust was fluffy and airy! 
Definitely plan to come back when I have a pizza craving. Roughly $12 for a personal sized pizza and a drink."}
{"text":"Bit pricey when adding a couple of soft drinks BUT it's real quick and fresh. Shockingly fast."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to go for lunch because they can't handle even the smallest of lunch rushes. I ordered a pizza and had it so it was going to be ready for 12, I asked the woman at the front when it was going to be ready and she grunted and pointed. At 1207 I asked again and was greeted with a nice bit of attitude. At this point the pizza wasn't even made yet and I have 7 minutes more for lunch. I cancelled my order at this point. Ps. Thanks for making me go hungry"}
{"text":"(Should be 3.5/5 stars)
I had the custom pizza from Pi Co today for $13. There are so many toppings to choose from (including 2-4 sauces and 5-7 cheeses) and all of them seem very fresh! The staff were very friendly and explained to me how the system works (it was my first time). 

I was also happy to see they used a real wood-burning pizza oven! The pizza came out relatively fast. It was a good size; 2 could share if they weren't so hungry. 

On my pizza I got tomato sauce (Italian), ricotta, olives, red pepper, basil, and spinach. In hindsight, the ricotta was a mistake. The pizza was a little burnt, but I didn't mind. Overall the flavors mixed nicely together but it wasn't incredible. 

I think it's a great little lunch spot, and the price is great for the quality, but it's nothing to rave over. Maybe I should've gotten their famous margarita instead, but go try it for yourself to find out!"}
{"text":"The food (4/5): I've had Pi Co on 2 occasions: take-out and eat in. Their regular Margherita pizza is pretty bomb considering its just sauce and cheese. They strike a good balance for a place that's fast food, so go ahead and try it out as your first pizza here, you'll come back like i did :) The next pizza I had, i piled it with vegetables, meats and 2 different types of cheeses! I know they recommend a limit to the ingredients but hey my pizza was still great! First bite in and you can already taste how fresh and top notch the toppings were. My only qualm about their pizza is that the crust is so thin the pizza slices fall limp if you try to hold it in your hands. Use a fork and knife here to eat your pizza!

The price (4/5): $13 + tax to craft your own individual pizza with unlimited toppings. Not a bad price in my opinion for the quality you get. 

The service (3.5/5): No dedicated servers here, its pretty much a fast food place. However, this place can get pretty packed and even though each pizza is fast fired, the wait can get long especially during the lunch hour. But in the evenings its less busy so you'll receive your pizza promptly :)

Ambience (3.5/5): The place itself seats around 12 people and the tables could be cleaned off more regularly but overall a decent place to sit and eat in if you find room."}
{"text":"My two friends and I came for pizza, they ordered theirs and I ordered mine last. As I was about to pay for my pizza, the employee dropped the pizza on the floor. Mistakes happen and I understand that, but the customer service was non existent. I was sent to the back of the line to place my order all over again, I was asked, \"are you in a rush?\" ... Well obliviously, my friends are sitting at the table eating their pizza. I waited for the two girls in line ahead of me to pay, as I approached the cash, the cashier told me the drink is on me. Wow thanks so much for throwing in a can of $2 ginger ale for my trouble- I should've been helped before anyone else and the pizza should've been comped. Will not return here."}
{"text":"My colleague was raving about the food here so we decided to trek in the rain to go try.  I'm glad I went.  Even though there was a line-up, service is very quick.  Great taste, fresh and price.  It's mostly a takeout place but there are a few tables on the side for people choosing to eat there.  

Food:
Had the thin-crust, fresh, delicious pizza with unlimited toppings.  I love the craft your own option.  Lots of fresh toppings to choose from.  Besides the craft your own pizza, they also had a craft your own salad option that my friend chose which she liked a lot.  Overall, I'll definitely be back to try the salad too and more pizzas.  :)"}
{"text":"So disappointed! This place was recommended by co-workers and friends because they saw the restaurant offered GF dough. 

If you are celiac or have a gluten intolerance I highly recommend NOT going. 
I ordered my Gluten Free dough and it was pulled out from under the counter in a plastic wrap and I had to ask the guy to wash his hands before he touched it. He was about to put it in the same flour that was on the counter with the regular dough! I could see he was bothered at this point, but he lightly moved the regular flour. Then proceeded to place the GF crust on the same board as the regular pizza crust. They put the toppings on and threw it in the oven. Once in there, the same 'shovel' was used for the pizza's beside me and mine. They pulled it out and cut the pizzas with the same pizza cutters. 

All cross contamination, basically defeating the point of the GF dough. I wasn't going to eat it but I had already paid and was starving at this point) It was my mistake for deciding to eat it because i was instantly sick and been sick now for days because of it; definitely never going back."}
{"text":"Overpriced cardboard pizza and the owners are a joke. The only good thing about this place is the location. You're better off at Pizza Pizza down the street (and even thats a stretch!) Avoid!"}
{"text":"The toppings are great, and it's a great selection-- but I found the crust doughy and soggy."}
{"text":"Very unpleasant experience. My boyfriend (who's asian - you'll see why this is significant in a bit) went during his lunch break and there were two white ladies viewing the menu so he went ahead to order. The first employee took his order no problem. The other worker who was a white male, started making the pizza at first, but then pushed it away and refused to make it. He insists that the two white ladies were in line \"first\" and when my boyfriend tried to differ, both workers just ignored him. They wouldn't make his pizza and would not listen to his complaint but went ahead to serve the two ladies who STILL wasn't ready to order. Did they think that if the two ladies were in line that they wouldn't have spoken up if they were being cut in line? I believe this is a case of discrimination and it's very disturbing."}
{"text":"Pi co is a great customizable pizza place. You can get a margherita pizza for $9 or pay a little more to get unlimited toppings. Personally I like getting the margherita pizza a lot so I usually get this.

The crust is on the thicker side and its fresh and chewy. However, I prefer thin crust and can't stop comparing this place to my favourite pizza place in Toronto- BLAZE PIZZA! It's the same concept but slightly cheaper and better in my opinion.

However since blaze is down at Dundas and I work near Bloor, Pi Co is a good enough substitute"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner with a friend and was pretty impressed! I don't usually go to pizza places often and not many places impress me much but this one was different. Simple, easy, fast and tasted good if you want a quick summary of my experience.

Honestly the only reason why we walked in was because my friend thought it was woodoven baked pizzas buuuuut that was not the case. Just a regular oven built big and looked similar to a woodoven one. Regardless, we still tried their pizzas out. It's a small shop so don't intend to go with a group bigger than 5 people otherwise you will probably invade half their tables and/or store, no joke!

We got the Marguerrita pizza and a \"Craft Your Own\" pizza and their pizza sizes were good for one person per pizza. Pretty filling depending on the toppings you had. Taste was great, soft and a bit charred at the crust but toppings and everything came together well. I actually went a bit crazy with the toppings and didn't think of it like a pizza at the time I was deciding what to put on it so I definitely dealt with the consequences later on. Nonetheless everything still tasted good!

If I ever crave and want some quick pizza, this is a place I'd return to if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Great tasting food, good prices.  Had the make your own and was well worth it.  Had the spicy sauce, mozzarella, onion, pineapple, olives, bacon, and pepperoni.  Love the unlimited toppings.  Great pizza reminded me of eating in Rome.  The front is small and not a lot of seating, but what do you want for a place that is categorized as fast food.  Definitely going again."}
{"text":"This is a fast food style pizza joint but damn is it good! $13 for a decently sized personal pizza with a sauce, a cheese, and unlimited additional toppings? Get outta here. The toppings choices are vast and great and the dough is so good, thin and crispy in some parts thick and chewy in others, perfection. I actually can't wait to go back here and try a dessert pizza!"}
{"text":"I love their unique idea of diy pizza and it was very cool , it was very clean and everything was great , it's a little small but very nice place"}
{"text":"Good price for delicious pizza, get to add as many toppings as you want, ready in under 10 minutes. Not too much space inside to sit and eat."}
{"text":"This was a planned visit as we were visiting an exhibit nearby. First word of caution this a more grab and go kind of spot as seating is limited. 
The concept is kind of straight if you ask me there are two option you get the margherita or you make your own. 
Options for dough, options for sauce, options for cheese, options for tomatoes, options for meats etc etc. It can get overwhelming real quick. I tried to keep it somewhat sane as had 2 types of cheese, one type of meat, sun dried tomatoes and peppers. 
The pizza was ready real fast as we went off peak hours. For starters the pizza is soggy so either over sauced or something is off with the dough or baking temp. The only have plastic cutlery which doesn't lend itself to soggy pizza. I recommend one ask for the pizza to be sliced to more than 4 pieces even if eating by hand. 
Now for the service oh boy do they need to be trained here. For starters don't walk away while you are in the middle of taking my order for no apparent reason. Other issues mentioned elsewhere are still present. I understand this is fast food and I don't expect white linen service but this is downright unacceptable. 
I would say 2 stars."}
{"text":"To start off, the pizza is delicious. My friend and I ordered two of the custom pizzas. I would return for the pizza again...
however, the gentleman behind the counter was very unpleasant. He made us feel like we were wasting his time. If he didn't already start preparing the pizzas we would have just left. 
Had it not been for the terrible service I would have gave Pi Co a 5 star for sure. 
Terrible staff can ruin an experience."}
{"text":"After mexican food Pizza is #2 on my list of favs so Im very hard on pizza places.  With this new pizza shop being right around the corner from my favourite H&M on bloor I just had to try it. This is the best fast service pizza Ive had in a long time !!! The unlimited toppings, the thin crust is thin and perfectly chewy ;  just writing about it makes me want to go there now."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast. Don't know why it only has 3.5 stars. If you like the thin chewy crust you'll like this. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Blaze pizza so was really excited to try the upscale version at Pi Co. Unfortunately I left dinner very disappointed, and also still hungry. By comparison, Pi Co falls short on all 3 accounts: taste, service, and price.

Taste: 3.5/5
I wasn't able to eat a lot of my pizza since was so burnt on the bottom! The tomato sauce here is also really sour, and overpowered the taste of everything else. One thing that I did like was their dough, though I couldn't enjoy much because it most of it tasted like charcoal.

Service: 1/5
None of the employees greeted me when I walked in and I had to wait for them to make another pizza just to order. During my meal, I noticed another customer ask for a refund because her pizza had been left out for a while before she could pay for it, and was now cold. The place felt very sleepy with a lack of proper management. 

Price: 4/5
The price isn't bad for Yorkville, but it's still pretty steep for a personal pizza. Definitely satisfying if you want to treat yo'self."}
{"text":"Discovered this place walking around the neighbourhood and it has become one of my go-to pizza places ever since. They offer fresh, custom-made pizzas in a casual setting. I mostly order take-out as the restaurant itself is quite small. 

For $13, you can order a custom pizza with unlimited toppings that is cooked in 5 minutes or less. One of the things I love about this place is the variety and quality of toppings. And, if you're a cheese lover like me, they have 9 different kinds of cheese to choose from!!"}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings? Oh hell yes!!
My salad was so amazing (obviously since I curated it)! Pi Co has so many amazing topping choices for your pizza/salad. I've had the wonderful pleasure of having tried both. 
Try going after the lunch rush (after 1pm). I did feel a bit rushed to make my decision on toppings, which isn't fun because there is so many flavour combinations to consider!! 
But seriously though, getting your custom made pizza in under 5mins? Nothing can really beat that! Great job Pi Co!!"}
{"text":"Used the Grabb mobile app to order this pizza in advance. When I arrived 10 minutes later, my pizza was waiting for me on the counter. I walk by this place daily during my commute home (it's right beside the Bay subway entrance) and it doesn't seem too busy in the evening hours, although I imagine it gets busy at lunch. 

The margherita pizza was quite good - thin with a medium crust that was the right mix of chewy and crispy. 

The mozzarella cheese tasted very fresh and of high quality, as did the basil, sauce and dough. 

The pizza is a good size for lunch and even for a light dinner. At $9 the margherita is also reasonably priced.  I would go back."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic!  The staff and manager are wonderful!  We just moved here from NYC and it is great to have a local pizza place that makes awesome bespoke pies quickly.  Excellent gluten free crust too!"}
{"text":"Such a nice idea to make your own pizza with the fresh ingredients which you like or inspire you the most. Any pizza topic of your wish, found on your plate. And fast service as well for a quick lunch. Before running back to work."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst and rude service ever. We made an order over doordash and we waited for over 60 mins with 2 delays and the food was cold and over 30 percent of the orders were missing.

So we went back to the restaurant and the staff was so incompetent and rude. The staff told us that we have to wait for a long time for our order or if you don't want to wait then you won't get your food (which we paid for). Never going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! It's a very good sized personal pizza, and it always tastes fresh and delicious. I use the Ritual app so I don't have to wait in the lunch line ups. I ordered the pizza dough once and regretted it, it was basically just barely flavoured pizza crust. Don't get me wrong I love pizza crust, but it wasn't anything special, so you might as well fill up on actual pizza. I might give them the benefit of the doubt that they had recently opened when I ordered them, but probably won't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"We went to the original location of Pi Co. which was at Bay and Bloor (right in the heart of Toronto).

The process at Pi Co. worked exactly like at Blaze Pizza: you pick the dough you wanted, then the pizza sauce, cheese, and unlimited toppings for a set price.  There were a good number of people dining in here when we arrived.  They have two tables and some stools for dine-in, but it seemed like a lot of people opted for take-away orders.

We shared a Craft Yours Pizza.  We chose a regular dough, with some Crushed San Marzano Tomatoes sauce, followed by four types of cheese -- blue cheese, goat cheese, fior di latte, and parmesan -- followed by a good helping of vegetables like basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and then bacon and ground sausage.  Then our pizza was thrown into the 1,000-degree oven for 90 seconds for a classic Neapolitan pizza style. 

It was a very, very quick cooking process.  After paying for the pizza at the cashier and waiting just a few seconds, I saw the staff bring out our pizza from the oven, plop it into a pizza box (we asked for it to-go), and cut it up for us.  Ninety seconds was incredibly fast and thus there was practically zero wait time from start to finish.

Even as I was watching the staff assemble our pizza together by throwing on the toppings that we selected, I felt that he wasn't as generous as the staff were at Blaze Pizza.  I also felt that the male staff threw all of the toppings into the centre part of the pizza and didn't scatter them out evenly.  This made for a potentially lop-sided pizza where not every bite had the substantial toppings to taste.  (Although I could have asked the male staff to add more ingredients in if I felt like there wasn't enough, the staff at Blaze Pizza in comparison put down a lot of generous toppings without asking.  The customized pizza at Blaze Pizza also costs less at $10.)

I also noted that our pizza was quite burnt in two places on the top and also on the bottom.  I know that it must be hard to judge the pizza's cooking time especially since they have other orders in the 1,000-degree oven too but these were the things I noticed.

In terms of taste, I really liked the chewy thin crust of the pizza.  What I didn't like were the underwhelming number of ingredients and burnt parts."}
{"text":"I discovered this place scrolling through Instagram one night and was immediately excited by the thought of a pizzeria that offers UNLIMITED toppings?? Count me in!! Located literally right outside Bay Station, this contemporary, minimalist looking pizzeria offers a small, but special menu for the hungry, intrigued, pizza lover like myself. 

I decided to go with the Create Your Own Pizza option that comes with unlimited toppings (of course) and selected a smorgasbord of ingredients that I enjoy together. I also tried a few new ingredients that I never tried on a pizza such as goat cheese and roasted garlic. I believe by the end of everything I had put around 12 toppings and to be honest, I wanted to put even more on but was intimidated by the low-key scowl of the employee serving me The judgement is real. But hey, I was just sticking to the restaurant's unique selling point of UNLIMITED toppings. 

The pizza is baked in a fast-bake oven, and boy was it fast. I swear I only had to wait 3 mins for it to come out fresh, piping hot, and with a light char on the crust. They cut it into 4 generous slices for your convenience. 

The pizza itself was amazing, the dough was fresh and fluffy, and the toppings allowed me to experience a burst of different flavours in every bite. It was really something that I indulged in with constant enthusiasm. It's a good size and will definitely fill up a person.

Overall, a lovely and memorable experience and I will be sure to come back to try out some more toppings. I also want to dip my foot into their dessert \"Pi\" realm. The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars is because the service is not as welcoming as I expected. In the end though, it's a great, little place to try out beside Bay Station."}
{"text":"This restaurant is total butts. Most disappointing za ever. My mouth only tastes like burnt following this disaster"}
{"text":"I'm always down to finding new pizza places around Toronto, so when I found out Pi Co had opened in Yorkville, I had to go try it myself. The place was super busy when I arrived at around noon on a Friday. There is very little seating inside as the place itself is relatively small. 

They offer the classic Margherita for $9 and also the option to customize your own with unlimited toppings for $13. Although the place was super busy, the line moved quickly and the staff were all very friendly. I opted for the classic margherita. Their pizzas cook in little to no-time in their fire oven. 

The pizza flavours lacked any real taste to be honest, there wasn't much of a wow factor. I guess I was hoping for a more gourmet pizza since it is located in Yorkville and $9 is pretty steep for a pizza of its size. The bottom of my pizza was completely covered in charred bits, which was not very pleasant as it overpowered the classic margherita flavour. Would I come back? Probably not. There are better places around Toronto for pizza at the same price Pi Co is offering."}
{"text":"Soooo good! The crust is perfect and the toppings are very generous! It's a small little place but the food is great! I loved how crispy yet soft the crust was, with the slight smoky flavor, def one of my fav pizza places."}
{"text":"$4 for a gluten-free crust is a bit excessive. This is the future! Charge $2 extra if you must, but come on! On a side note, the crust was absolutely over-cooked, burnt even. Great location and nice selection of toppings but I will not recommend nor return. Oh, and they forgot to sprinkle the pizza with arugula as promised when it came out of the oven."}
{"text":"Good food (4 stars) but terrible organization. Ordered off rituals and went there 20 min later when I was told my order was ready. When I got there they hadn't even looked at my order. The cashier told me that the customers there get served first. Sorry but I paid for my order 20 minutes ago and I'm here now. They served a few other customers despite me being there before printing my order to make. Another half hour later, finally got my order but they missed a topping. I've ordered off rituals at every place in the area and I've never heard such bs."}
{"text":"The price is right, the taste is on point and the topping selection is decent. It's a fairly good alternative for a quick pizza lunch if you don't have time to sit at Nervosa. They seem a little disorganized with taking orders but that could be because they are the new kids in town."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a vegan pizza and I wanted to eat clean.  So even though I could go to Pizza Nova, I felt like trying something different.  I've passed this place on multiple times, but it was always packed, however I went early today. I ordered the regular crust with spinach, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and onions. 

I did like the taste of the pizza and all the toppings were fresh as well, which is quite the benefit.  The pizza took less than 5 minutes, so speedy service indeed. 

However, why I am only giving it 3 stars?  Well they had no vegan cheese or vegan protein to choose from. If they did, I'd probably give it 4 stars.

Verdict: I think if you want a vegan pizza, it's okay, but if you want a pizza with meat, they are probably a good choice."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last weekend for a post-pub bite to eat. 

Ordered the $13 personal pizza with unlimited toppings. They have some solid toppings choices, along with various types of dough, sauce, and cheese. 

Pizza took about five minutes to cook and was actually quite nice. Thin crust style. A bit pricey than maybe I'd like but I enjoyed it. I believe the plain pizza was much more reasonably priced, to be fair. 

Would stop in here again"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my friend. We decided to share a pizza and desert pizza. For savoury pizzas, we had a choice to customize our pizza for $13 or get a Margherita pizza for $9. It was our first time there and the choices were overwhelming so it took us quite a while to decide on toppings. Once finished the pizza goes into the oven for 90 seconds. 

The oven cooked everything perfectly (800 degrees lol). The crust was a little bit more burnt than I would've liked. The employees were very friendly and even made a suggestion of adding fresh arugula to the pizza after it's been baked and it was a good suggestion. The arugula added extra depth to the pizza. 

The pizza was in between a personal size and small pizza. For me, I was full after eating half plus half the dessert pizza. My friend on the other hand was still a bit hungry. 

Overall it was a good experience and Pi Co reminds me of the Pieology chain in Las Vegas just less greasy. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice place on Bay&Bloor! The pizzas were pretty good and delivered an authentic wood-fired experience. I ordered a custom pizza with olives, basil, pepperoni, bacon, and sopressa (unlimited toppings for $13 !!!).  It was nice to see all the possible FRESH toppings right in front of me.

Giving it 4/5 stars because there was not much seating, the environment was not as comfortable as a restaurant, and there are better pizzas out there! It`s good for the price though. I would definitely come back !!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint where you can get a custom pizza with so many different toppings. Love the idea of unlimited toppings, as you can really load up on all your favorites!

The pizza is very thin, so one pizza is not enough to fill me up for dinner. But it makes a nice snack.

They only cook the pizza for a couple of mins at most, so if your pizza is loaded on toppings, the crust isn't very crisp. Ours was quite soggy and felt apart while holding the slice. 

They only also have one size for the main pizza (although they have a smaller size for the dessert pizza). So rather than ordering a large/x-large pizza for a big group, you have to order several of these one-size personal pizzas, which can get quite expensive.

Overall, nice to try, but unless I'm in the area looking for a snack, wouldn't bother driving all the way here for this."}
{"text":"For a small joint in a busy area - bring it on! 

If you are an artisanal pizza fan, you may either greatly enjoy this place, or thumb your nose at it. 

Given the price and the speed of service, I'd go with the first - this is a great place, for a quick, healthy bite, with a wide variety of ingredients, super friendly service, and great taste to match.

Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have the best pizza, but it definitely has the best fast wood fired oven in the city. Either in person or through Uber Eats, you will get this pie fast and it won't disappoint. With unlimited toppings for $13, you will be sure to get a loaded thin crust pizza for what seems like a bargain. Pie Co has definitely become a regular spot and cannot wait until the Yonge & Eglington location opens up across the street from my work."}
{"text":"Moves relatively quickly, personally if I saw more than 1/2 a dozen people inside I'd avoid, otherwise the oven is hot and quick!
The location is fantastic, right before the Bay subway entrance.  I like the idea (make your own pizza essentially and somewhat quickly).
They need to better organize the entrance, there is a sign that is backwards (the staff get to see it), that reads ORDER HERE, most will assume to go to the cash.
Would return."}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, the food is so-so. On the surface it seems decent that your pizza is assembled on the spot and cooked, but it doesn't come out as well as I hoped. The pizza has some charred spots on top and lots of carbon on the bottom, which is bitter and probably not edible. Almost all other pizza I ate - even from bottom-of-the-barrel fast food places - are cooked evenly and not burnt. On top of that, the price is relatively expensive for not so much food or toppings."}
{"text":"Pizza would have been great if the crust wasn't so burnt on the bottom. I'm all for flavour, but 80% of my crust under the pizza was black (see photo of my rejected crusts). The outer edges of the pizza definitely tasted bitter. The \"top\" of the pizza was really delicious, if only the bottom was as well. Not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great concept, delicious pizza (coming from a pizza \"connaisseur\" haha). Nice spots to seat alone or with friends, and free wifi, with some electric plugs. Very great, you'll see me again!"}
{"text":"It is very misleading for them to call their pizza crust \"gluten free\".  My husband (who has celiac), ordered a pizza from them, relaying instructions about a separate cooking surface, changing gloves, etc.  No restaurant can guarantee no cross-contamination, but most that advertise GF options are willing to make a good faith effort to vastly reduce chances of cross-contamination.  They removed his GF pizza with the communal paddle and placed it on a flour covered surface.  He explained the issue, and how he couldn't eat that pizza, and they said they couldn't guarantee no cross-contamination.  My husband said he understood, but with some simple practices, they could make a good faith effort to avoid it, and they refused to try, re-make the pizza or anything.  He eventually spoke to the manager, who reiterated the same message.  My husband had the leave the pizza behind (which he'd already paid for).  Disappointing and definitely NOT celiac-friendly."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending a wine tasting at the ROM with Super Elite Yelper, Jennifer K. There aren't too many places she hasn't dined at but she suggested we try Pi Co after the tasting. Who am I to argue with the author of over 5,700 reviews?

Pi Co makes one size of pizza at one price, $13.00. You do, however, get unlimited toppings from a multitude of choices. We had one with a spicy tomato sauce, Gouda, mozzarella, sausage, bacon, grilled chicken, onions, roasted garlic... I feel like I'm forgetting something. We ordered a second pizza with a spicy sausage, cherry tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and arugula.

Both pizzas were very good. After all, we ordered the things we like. The crust was thin and crispy, although I prefer mine even a tad crispier.

Unlimited toppings is a nice concept but it's easy to get carried away and put too much on it. I like the idea of being able to try different flavour combinations. I just wish they had a white sauce.

Where are we going next, Jennifer K.?"}
{"text":"For a gluten free pizzeria this place is awesome!! It's rare to find gluten free crust that isn't grainy or too melt-in-your-mouth. Pi Co really hits the nail on the head with their pizza dough. My partner's mother has Celiacs and we took her here one day and she absolutely loved it. $13 for unlimited toppings is also a great price considering the area. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Rude lady. Trying to order was impossible as she walked around carrying order sheets and turned her back to us. I had to leave because of her ignorance"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.  I smelled a nice aroma while walking by this spot and decided to try it. I wasn't disappointed,  this is a quite good pizza.  $13 buys you your very own special pizza with unlimited toppings,  all cooked in 90 seconds.  At the end you have a pretty good naplotana style pizza, so soft dough in the middle.  Really very nice and I will come back here."}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch today after a work gig. Got their $9 Margherita pizza (with extra basil) and their beet Caprese salad. Both were yummy! Even though they were towards the smaller portion size, I felt they were enough to keep me full and I had a bit of leftover for later. The staff was super friendly and the ambience was beautiful! Would definitely recommend for an economical and freshly made cheat meal - tons of cheese and dough!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd like it, I thought it would be just another pizza joint like all the others popping up around town. I was wrong.

Pi Co, does pizza and it does it well. The crust is near perfect, the flavours are intense and the toppings are limitless. The cheese selection alone is worth the $13, but when you add in all those other options available, you get real value. 

What's more is that the service is fast, efficient and cooking time is somehow faster than a fill up at a gas station. 

There's really no reason not to go here. Hungry? Get a pizza for yourself! Not hungry? Split one with a friend! Just get down here and grab yourself a pi."}
{"text":"So finally saw this place opened and decided to give it a try. I ordered through the ritual app but by the time I got there they were just starting my order. Which was fine since I actually picked other extra ingredients to add to my custom pizza. The concept is pretty good as you can get unlimited toppings though the price reflects that too at $13 a custom pizza. The baking was actually faster than I thought and within minute my pizza is ready! The environment is open and clean but I decided to eat outside since the weather is great. As for the pizza I think the dough and toppings and their house tomato sauce is pretty good balance and taste good. I would come again but since it is pretty filling this is what I would do.... Tips: get a colleague and custom it half / half and share the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Nothing amazing but not terrible. The whole ordering process is a bit weird.  Behind the counter was complete chaos and they were all bumping into each other and kept trying to figure out whose pizza belonged to who. The toppings weren't put on evenly for any of the pizzas I saw getting made. There's a speaker blasting top 40 music directly above where you place your order which is stupid and delays everything since you need to be in constant communication with the staff through the whole process and everyone needs to repeat themselves. It was kinda cool that the pizza cooks in a few minutes but that was about the only cool thing about this place.  I ordered two pizzas to go and the paper bag they gave me was basically useless as it doesn't allow you to carry the pizza horizontally.  I look back and the whole thing was pretty funny. I kept thinking about the seinfeld episode with kramer's idea to make your own pizza. This place needs an operational tune up else it doesn't stand a chance as the pizza just isn't worth the price ($13) and hassle.  Wasn't my thing but I'm guessing the hipsters probably love it."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place. Service was great. The staff were super nice. From the time it took to pay for my order, create my pizza, and have it cooked took no time at all! I was actually surprised at how fast they cooked the pizza. The place was clean and it seats about 40 people. I'm glad this place is closer to me because going downtown for Blaze Pizza can be a hassle. The pizza is pretty small and thin. I would suggest having your own since there is only 4 slices. And unlimited toppings for that price is amazing."}
{"text":"I tried their Margherita pizza on their free pizza day and it was actually very good. Considering they were churning out pizzas at a torrid pace, the quality and taste of the pizza was excellent. The flavour was on point. It seems like they make thin crust pizzas that are baked on a stone oven to perfection. I can only imagine how good their pizza would be on a regular day. 

My first impression: Good stuff.

Taking a look at the rest of the menu, it looked like they offer Pizza at a set price of $13 with any toppings you want (not sure if there is a limit). They also seemed to be offering \"dessert\" pizzas at a $6 clip. I'd definitely be inclined to come back to try these out."}
{"text":"I shared a create-your-own pizza with my sister at this Pi Co location last night. The service was lightning-fast which, together with the smaller location, mean it's best set up for take-out. We decided to eat in as we weren't anywhere near home and had to reserve our seats with our bags while we ordered (yes, we were THOSE people) and were rushed out by other customers circling the table as soon as we'd taken the last bite.

Despite the tight squeeze and rushed meal, the experience was great. The pizza's thin crust helps stave off the guilt so you can totally eat a whole pizza without feeling bad. There's a good selection of toppings.

I think the process would be smoother if the pizzas went to a 'finishing' station before paying, where you can choose to put your arugula or balsamic vinegar etc. on after cooking."}
{"text":"The weekly ritual...gotta give this place credit they make a mean pizza! This place is great because you can build your own pizza for 13 bucks and it's def a bargain for how much food you're getting. You can choose the wide range of toppings -different cheeses and meats! The beauty of this place is that the pizza is made in under 90 seconds. Also, make sure you try the garlic bread it was super good!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Surprisingly quick service and the unlimited topping option is the one I always go for because of their great selection of toppings. 13 bucks and i get a delicious pizza with unlimited toppings. Very good."}
{"text":"Very good thin crust pizza. Had the marguarita one for $10. Would come back. Trendy atmosphere, fast service, and good location."}
{"text":"No complaints here - this is good as it gets in the city! If you love thin crust pizza, then look no further!

Anywhere you order a pizza, you get to create your own. But what made Pi Co different was that you get to see them craft it right in front of you. The fresh ingredients were definitely a plus, not to mention the variety of things they had. The staff were super patient and friendly, price point was right, wait for the food was not long at all - definitely coming back to this place the next time I'm craving a good Neapolitan pizza. 

I strongly recommend the Margarita (adding other ingredients is like the cherry on top) and the Nutella Banana Pi - simple, but sooo delicious. Oh, can't forget their dipping sauce and chilli oil."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place brings \"fast food\" to a whole other level. Pizzas are made fresh with so many things to customize (dough, sauce, cheese, toppings) and then they pop it in the oven and it's ready in 3 mins. flat. I took my friend here recently and she was so shocked at how fast it was done, she had to open the box and double check that it was indeed cooked. They have a variety of veggie and meat toppings, and not just the \"standard\" ones. I'm partial to the roasted garlic. Why don't more pizza places have that as an option? SO good. 

They also do salad, but why would you come here for that? 

There is a nutella filled pizza for dessert, but I tried it and it was not as yummy as it looked and kind of dry. I'd skip it next time. 

I still give this spot 5 stars for the pizzas alone, as well as for efficient ordering/paying, consistently nice staff, and a bright, clean seating area if you can't wait to go home and eat it."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! I still can't get over the fact a margherita pizza of this quality is only $10. (If you want more toppings, you can get unlimited for a total cost of $14.) It's thin crust pizza with nice chewy crust. (My only minor complaint is I wish the middle of the pizza was slightly thicker but that's a personal preference.) I've been twice and both times the service has been really fast. Go here as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"Nice modern spot. Open clean environment. Straight forward menu with a hand full of items, priced well. 

Tried the Margherita pizza, gets the job done. No skimpy toppings, fresh cheese, good crust. Has the stone baked Italian pizza taste. Overall order time was quick, would say around 5 minutes. The pizza came out of the oven with the cheese bubbling and crust puffed up. Added chili flakes, good stuff.  

Would go again and recommend if your into this style of pizza."}
{"text":"I would rate this place as 4 stars, though my wife disagreed and gave it 3.
I loved this way of making the pizza, you can choose your toppings, and it is almost perfect.
The staff are nice, helpful and they can recommend options and communicate well with customers
The crust is lovely, and the taste of the char on the sides is delicious.
The size is small, i thought you can get medium pizza at least for 15 cad.
The toppings are fresh and tasty, but i have couple of comments: roasted garlic needs more roasting and must be cut into smaller pieces, there is no caramelized onions or white sauce.
I recommend people to come and try this thin crust pizza place, you might like the concept, definitely better than other pizza places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"In terms of quick but quality wood oven pizza, this is the best. I'd also highly recommend their build your own salad! I order from here through Uber Eats/ take out the most because there isn't much seating."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I actually like the thicker, chewier crust here (compared to Blaze), but they are both welcome options for downtown pizza. The pizza here is FAR better than Terroni, and roughly half the price. I hope they open a location in my neighbourhood soon!"}
{"text":"Choose base, sauce, cheese and toppings- anything and everything! Fresh a d flavourful! 
This make your own pizza/salad place is located next to bay station and is a good for a pick up or  a quick meal. They have seating space for around 10-12 people. 

The handmade pizza base are thin and you can choose from regular to gluten free. You get to choose from san Marzano, spicy tomato sauce and pesto. You can choose to mix them too! Wild eh?

And any number of toppings and combinations! Go crazy and experiment! No one is judging! 

The salads were pretty standard but again you can choose the ingredients and dressings. 

Loved the pizzas!"}
{"text":"One of the best real pizza place in Toronto. Craft pizza by yourself is the best option that they offer. Pizza is really fresh."}
{"text":"I was hungry and needed to stop by somewhere during lunch to eat. I was running low on time and pizza was the last thought on my mind.

We've all been there, waiting and waiting for pizza and eventually it comes. This place shortens the waiting time and its WAY fresher by the time you inhale it (inhalation is almost guaranteed). The wait was shorter than expected so that was a big plus. One of the great benefits of this place is the unlimited toppings for the \"create your own pizza\" for $13. Otherwise it's $9 for the Margherita pizza which I can only assume is delicious as well. There are options a plenty here so you will most likely find something for you and I'm 95% sure I saw that there were gluten free options available too.

When I got my pizza made, I found that they skimped a bit on the toppings, HOWEVER when I ate it, I felt it was JUST the right amount so no complaints there. The staff were quick and friendly.

To be completely honest, this place felt like it was from New York. It's by far one of the best pizza's I've had in Toronto.

This might be a weekly staple at work for me."}
{"text":"Their pizza just tastes like average pizza but worse because my crust was burnt. It just tasted carcinogenic to be perfectly honest.

I also felt that they kind of skimped on the tomato sauce, but that could be because I like my sauce on the heavier side.

There are a lot of reviewers raving more about their custom pizzas rather than the margherita pizza, so perhaps that's what I should've gotten instead.

Nevertheless, I don't think I would come back for their margherita, but I would be willing to give their custom pizza a try."}
{"text":"Fire oven baked pizza, unlimited fresh toppings, and ready in under 5 minutes. What isn't there to like about this place. I keep coming back to this place and every time the pizza is tasty. One little tip, ask them to cook the pizza for longer if you like crispier type of crust/dough."}
{"text":"Had the create your own pizza on the gluten free crust.  Pizza crust was good for a gluten free crust and the choose as many toppings as you like was great.  i was disappointed thought as my pizza was quiet burnt.  I mentioned it as i paid and they indicated that it will just flake off as it was the flour.  I can tell you that it wasn't the case.  I ended up having black hands from trying to eat the pizza.  Overall it was a good pizza but given the cost $20 for gluten free and the amount it was burnt it's unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is not the location I want to do a review. I am reviewing the Adelaide and Simcoe location that just opened less than a month ago.  It's not on yelp yet.  I'll edit this post once it's on yelp.

Their pizzas are excellent.  You get to create your own pizza with unlimited toppings for $14.  Their pizzas are equivalent to some of the top pizza restaurants in the city but you get it alot quicker and cheaper.  Therefore, if you have a favorite pizza flavour just tell the staff you want those toppings and most likely they will have it.  The staff at the Adelaide and Simcoe location are very friendly.  I hope this does not change.  I live super close and definitely will be back several times this year."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night around 6:30 and it wasn't too crowded, but they did have a lot of online/mobile orders to get through before mine. 

FOOD: I tried the custom pizza (unlimited toppings for $14), but this pizza is really a double ended sword. To get your money's worth, you would want to load up on toppings but this decreases the quality of the pizza. Too many toppings makes the crust lose its weight and become soggy. Less toppings (especially less of the watery toppings) make the pizza taste better, but not worth the price. One thing I did like is the wide range of cheeses - from mozzarella, cheddar, feta to smoked provolone and fior di latte. 

ATMOSPHERE: The interior was more of a fast food looking restaurant where you can choose your own table once you order your food. HOWEVER, the winner of the atmosphere is their pie oven. This oven is a cute stoned dome shape and makes the business look a lot more authentic compared to its competitors. 

Overall, I think I would come here again just to give this place one more shot and to find that sweet spot of the double ended sword."}
{"text":"Awesome place you can get unlimited topping individual sized Italian pizza - thin pizza with slightly puffed up crust. I really liked the dough (not sloppy and not chewy - has great bite to it) and that they had good variety of toppings. Was happy they had real mozzarella, basil, sopressata, jalapeno, etc. The pizza goes into the wood fired oven, cooks for a bit, and comes out amazing.  This place, wood-fired oven and texture of the dough reminded me of Roberta's in Urban Space location in NYC. And I love Roberta's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept of Pi Co - choose from a variety of fresh toppings and have your custom pizza made fresh right in front of you, watching it cook in the oven in under 90 seconds and have a pipping hot pizza ready to eat in no time.

I was fortunately enough to be invited for a tasting event here. There were quite a few people getting their pizzas as well, but I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the process. The pizzas taste good too! Sure, you choose the toppings you like, but the crust for me is a very important part as well - it is nicely thin, and had the right kind of chewiness that I like. Their house-made tomato sauce is great too and they have two kinds to choose from.

I totally missed out on the fact they have truffle oil as an option as an add-on ($3 extra), otherwise I would have totally done it. Prices are definitely not bad considering it is a custom pizza place at Bay/Bloor - $9 for a margherita pizza or $13 for one with unlimited(!) toppings.

The only thing that is preventing me from giving this place a 5 star is that it is a bit on the small size (more geared towards take-out, but there are seats), and they don't have beer available (cold beer + fresh hot pizza = the bomb). The good news is that they are opening up another soon at Yonge/Eglinton, so here's hoping!

Hot tip: They are celebrating Pi day (March 14) by letting people craft any pizzas for only $3.14 from 12-3:14pm!"}
{"text":"Had the margherita pizza for lunch today and it was good. Went there as it was convenient to where I work. The crust was thin and chewy, good sauce and cheese. I wouldn't say it was the best I had but it was good. They have an option of doing unlimited toppings but at every pizza place I always try to get the margherita pizza the first time I go. If they can pull off a good margherita, then they can pull off other pizzas. It was around $12 for the pizza and a drink. The place is a bit small, so best to go before or after lunch hour if you want to eat in. I am sure they do a ton of takeout business. So verdict - very good and if I crave pizza for lunch while I am at work, I will go back."}
{"text":"Good and affordable pizza that can be customized to my list of food allergies I only wish there were more locations and closer to me."}
{"text":"Pi Co is my favourite place for margherita pizzas near downtown. It's fast, fresh, and great value. You can customize your toppings and also make the crust gluten free. 

The crust is cooked to perfection - great charred flavours. They could put a bit more mozzarella, but in all, great taste and great price. 

Perfect spot for a quick lunch or snack."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the quality of their dough, tomato sauce, or cheese. I ordered a $10 Margherita which was baked pretty fast, but it tasted average at best. Blaze Pizza at Yonge & Dundas tastes better IMHO and the concept is the same.

Once was enough for me. I'm not going back to Pi Co. I hope they improve the quality of their ingredients to retain discerning customers who actually give a damn about what they put in their bodies."}
{"text":"Pizza was a tiny bit burnt but still pretty good, place has a sleek modern look. Around $10 for a small pizza or something?"}
{"text":"I've been told by a couple people to come to this spot for some pretty solid pizza. These couple people though... they swear by pizza. I figured I needed to see what was rising here.

First glance as I walk into the Pi Co restaurant is that sweet oven they chuck those bad boys in. They're not the same ones you see at a big chain pizza joint though. Much more authentic looking. I was already salivating at that point.

I wanted to take a crack at the make your own pizza thing, so I went face first into the Californian Tomato Sauce with a drizzle of BBQ Sauce, basil, spinach, onions, roasted red peppers, spicy soppresata, bacon and ground sausage.

Let me tell you... I won't be offended if you pick the same ingredients. I liked it a lot, and I'm sharing it with you too.

The pizza was really delicious - dough was thin and just the right amount of crisp, and the ingredients really tasted fresh and savoury. Maybe it's because I chose my own ingredients... who knows?

I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you know me personally, you would know I'm the biggest TCWOP (thin crust wood oven pizza) fan. I'd literary go anywhere to taste one out!  This time I didn't need to go far, just down the block at Pi Co.  Actually I believe it's been opened for a month or two and always with a bunch of folks lining up inside.  On the weekends, it seems to have less office crowd ... So I decided to try it out.

It's pretty refreshing, they have a huge oven sitting out front, clean and well organized. The menu is short but right to the point. We decided to get the \"make your own\" which comes with unlimited toppings :) there are a lot of ingredients to chose from. You can start picking your dough (gluten free extra $3), cheeses, veggies and meat. I, of course likes it with extra cheese on top as well.

The entire process + cooking took less than 10 mins. The pizza is very thin and a bit thicker on the rim. It's smoky and very tasty. It's crispy too! Exactly how I like it. The one drawback is it tends to get burned at a few spots at the bottom and at the top of the rim. Minus those misfires, I'd say it's pretty good in my books. If the center of the crust is a tad thicker / simply crisper than it would be perffffect :)

Highlight of the visit: Unlimited toppings for Make Your Own options ... Only $13 bucks

{"text":"Pi Co is Yorkville's contribution to the ever-growing fast food pizza craze that has been spreading throughout the city. A classic Neopolitan style margherita will set you back just $9 and is rather satisfying. For $13, any or all of the wonderful selection of toppings and sauces can be combined to build yourself a custom pie. You can also choose a dessert pie or craft your own on the cheap.

Must-try items:
Margherita
Nutella Banana Pi 

The space is nicely distributed, designed, and decorated. It has an inviting atmosphere that includes a clear view of the special oven that fires up these babies in just 90 seconds. Views of Bay and Bloor and the Yorkville area take your mind off of whatever you were thinking (besides pizza of course). If you come here during peak periods, expect a lineup to form with a few minutes of wait time. Outside of that, it's enjoyable to sit here and dine in on some authentic 'za.

Crust that is perfect is hard to find, but theirs definitely comes close. Your meal will have good texture to it depending on what you select. Grab a beverage cause you'll need one to wash the grub down. A caprese salad come on the side for $6 or you can customize your own for $7/$12. They do good pi, try 'em out for yourself."}
{"text":"Working at Yonge and Bloor just got a whole lot better now that this place is around as a lunch option! There's almost always a lineup during peak lunch hours, but it was worth the wait.

You can either order a $9 margherita pizza, or a custom pizza for $13 with unlimited toppings. This one is a no-brainer for me - unlimited toppings is the way to go.

The amount of toppings you can choose from is impressive. Different sauces, cheeses, veggies and meats. The variety means you can load up your personal pizza however you want it.

I haven't tried it yet, but Pi co also offers dessert pizza options - I'll be back one day to see what the smore pizza is all about!"}
{"text":"Pi Co. is the latest pizza joint in Toronto to offer classic Neapolitan pizza made RIGHT! The new Yorkville pizza spot serves up thin-crust pizza, twice baked Neapolitan pizza pockets and dessert pies such as the epic Nutella Marshmallow Graham Crumb Pi. All of the ingredients are fresh, the dough is handmade using flour from Italy AND the pizza takes only 90 seconds to cook in their 1000-degree oven.  Customers have the opportunity to craft their own pizza by picking the dough, cheese, sauce and a variety of unlimited toppings.

I had the chance to join world-renowned Master Pizzaolo, Giulio Adriani, at Pi Co. to learn all about the newly launched gluten-free pizza dough as well as craft my own pizza. The exclusive gluten-free dough took years to perfect and Giulio really put a lot of research and passion into creating quality gluten-free dough that doesn't taste like cardboard.  We watched Giulio work with the dough which wasn't as stretchy as regular dough but still very manageable to work with.  He added the toppings and cooked it as he would a regular pizza and it came out looking identical.  After the first bite I thought that the dough tasted very similar to the regular pizza he had made.  The only difference was that the gluten-free dough was a bit chewier and light, but the texture and taste was spectacular. I'm not even sensitive to gluten but would buy the gluten-free pizza again, it's THAT good! 

After learning about the gluten-free dough, I crafted my own pizza which turned out quite nicely.  Apparently my dough stretching technique was on point and of course I loaded up with the toppings.  After 90 seconds my pizza was cooked and ready to be devoured! Giulio was really enthusiastic about sharing his love of pizza making with us, and it was a pleasure to learn from such a talented chef.

Pi Co. is definitely worth checking out as their pizza is always fast and free. The unlimited topping option is also very appealing with gourmet toppings such as truffle oil, roasted garlic, shaved asparagus, spicy soppressata and more. If you're not in the mood for pizza, there is a build-your-own salad bar or if you've got a sweet tooth there are a few dessert pockets to choose from."}
{"text":"Great Location at Bay just North of Bloor.

I love the concept of pick your own or you can go for their custom suggestions. Nothing beats a freshly baked pizza right out for the oven.

Minimum seating so don't come with a big group. A group of 4 probably the max.

At $13 it might sound like a bit for a pizza, but this is the prime downtown location so I do expect to pay a premium.

The hardest though is to make all these decisions! Base, Sauce, Cheese and So many toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"Swung by to get take-out for lunch. Good custom-made pizzas ready in two minutes. No complaints there.

But I do have an issue. I noticed they don't have a recycle box to throw used drink containers into. C'mon people - it's 2016. Even if you don't care about the environment, please allow those of us that do the means to do our part. A recycle box please."}
{"text":"I'm no math nerd, but $3.14 pizza on Pi Day? Yes please. 

Despite the 1.5 hour wait in the freezing cold (a LOT of people like cheap pizza), I enjoyed my first experience at Pi Co. Once I got inside the actual restaurant, the line moved relatively quickly and I had my pizza box in hand in less than ten minutes. They have a good variety of toppings, and even though they recommend only 4-5, you do you boo! Go ham!

For the sake of comparison, I will say that I like Blaze Pizza more - I prefer their thin crust and the fact that they have \"finishes\" like pesto drizzle and arugula. But since I work in the Yorkville area now, I'm perfectly happy coming to Pi Co instead for my custom 'za fix."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night,  great venue place looks clean and oraganized,  staff are welcoming, the consept of this place is basically create your own pizza for $13, ( unlimited toppings) I really like this idea. now the only reason why I'm giving this place a 3 stars is because the size of the pizza was very small, I really liked the pizza in my opinion was really good well cooked toppings where on point,  it's just that fact that if your hungry 1 pizza will not be enough. Theres something missing in this place to make it the best!!  They do have to work on a couple of things...  But eh if you have the munchies try it out it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this place ! Unlimited toppings for $13. And it's a pretty large pizza - I was definitely full by the end of it all. 

You can also get a side salad with unlimited toppings for $6. Can I get a yes !!!! 

The reason I didn't give Pi Co five stars is because the service wasn't the best. The staff did not seem too happy to be there that night but hey we all have bad days right ? 

Give this place a try :)"}
