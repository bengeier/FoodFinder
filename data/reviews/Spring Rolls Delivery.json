{"text":"It's been like all the Spring Rolls restaurants are - busy. The food is good but there are way too many items on the menu. They should reduce that, so the decision what to eat would be easier. And I think the authenticity of the food would improve.  Those restaurants are always packed and the waiters are doing their best to keep up with the orders.   The green curry was average. Last time I tried the bento box with salmon, that one was not quite authentic, but still good.  Great for Lunch..."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a birthday dinner. We decided with AYCE.. We had dimsum (shrimp dumpling and pork) It tasted bland and the dumpling was like rubber. Also ordered some seaweed salad, korean barbecue short ribs and a veg tempura. The korean barbecue short ribs was way too fatty and didnt look like it was barbecued at all.. More like boiled and than put on a pan or something. The sauce on it tasted like cheap fake soysauce with sugar.. The veg tempura was really greasy and the batter on it was soggy. The only decent thing for appetizer was seaweed salad. Lets move on.. Our waiter was a total douche. I even caught him drinking alcohol at the back. I swear hes the worst waiter ever. When we orded sushi he didn't even give us soy sauce.. like what world do you live in where sushi does not get served with soy sauce? Then, when we made another order of sushi, he didn't even give the plate of wasabi and ginger. (Btw I had to ask another waitress for soy sauce) It was a horrible dining experience. Rude lazy tipsy waiter and food was bland. I was nice enough to give a tip of $2.00. He didn't even say thank you. I honestly wished I just tipped a penny.. that sure would ruin his buzz."}
{"text":"*Dine In Review Only*  After a heavy-food-burger-beer filled Victoria Day weekend, I wanted something light. Pho immediately popped into my head and that craving just got more intense. My bf and I were around King and John area to wait for a friend and we asked if he felt like Pho. He did as well so we walked around, and unfortunately, wound up at Spring Rolls(?!?!?) Now I may have been very confused but I SWEAR Spring Rolls had Pho at one time (if they did, they do not have it anymore).  Anywhoo, that was a bust. We didn't want to walk anymore so decided to come here for a late-ish dinner. The restaurant was quite empty. Currently, they have a great deal: 3 Apps plus a Sapporo beer for only 10 bucks. Both my bf and friend decided to get that deal and our (smart) waitress asked us if we wanted to upsize the beer into a pitcher. We would basically be getting the most bang for our buck. Love it when great suggestions are offered.  For the table we shared: mango salad, Dynamite Roll, Tom Yum Soup, Calamari (this you can pass as it was cold and soggy), Lettuce Wraps, and a plate of Sushi/Sashimi (nothing bad with the fish here...fresh for what you get at a chain-y restaurant).   Overall, I know you can do a lot better, especially in this downtown core area. As you walk by Queen Street there are so many different type of cuisine and non-chain restaurants competing for your dollars. That being said, if you are familiar with a Spring Rolls, you're getting food you know, consistency, decent if not good service, and all for a decent price. So for those reasons, I am giving this location an A-OK."}
{"text":"Why is it that when you get dine-in Pad Thai, it has bean sprouts, but when you get it delivered there are none? Ever. Not once has my delivery Pad Thai come with bean sprouts. I even asked for them once, and they still did not put them on. I likes my bean sprouts! Where are they?"}
{"text":"The food can be pretty fantastic, the interiors are well crafted, the washrooms are clean.   The menus have lots of choice.  So, why two stars?  Because this Spring Rolls location at Queen West must be the worst managed location ever.   I ordered for a big group of people and called it in on the phone so I knew I would get this location close to us.   A Chinese woman with a manager tag goes to get my order, then berates me for not using their internet ordering system.  I just ordered 18 meals!  It was so disrespectful, the waitress apologized for her manager's attitude.  This is how you take an awesome restaurant at an amazing location and still have seats half full."}
{"text":"I hate fusion. Not that the food is bad.  it is just severely overrated and whitewashed. I MUST say though that they make it PRETTY unintimidating to eat asian food.  I can understand how white people like going here- it can be weird for you when you walk into a chinese restaurant, can't read the menu and get handed a fork right away. But really... you can get better food elsewhere. Be more adventurous and try to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to write a review for the delivery from spring rolls but i didn't know how I would provide a location. This location totally popped up though when I checked for \"spring rolls delivery\" and even though the first reviewer didn't seem to have gotten delivery, and this must be a eat-in location, im just going to go with it.  Spring Rolls delivery service is pretty awesome. You either call them or order online and essentially everything they have on the menu can be delivered. Their delivery zone is pretty giant for the downtown core and the minimum for free delivery is $15. $2 delivery fee for anything below.   The food, on the other hand, is less commendable. I ordered the famous house padthai (shrimp and chicken) for $11.99, green curry chicken on rice 10.99, and mango salad with satay chicken skewers for 10.99.   The portions are small. The flavours are boring. The only thing I really liked was the satay skewer, not even the mango salad.  The total for the above was $40 before tip. Not cheap.  The fact that they deliver to my place is a bonus, so I might have to continue ordering from there until I find a better alternative...  They do take CC, even Amex, for delivery."}
