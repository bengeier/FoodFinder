{"text":"We stayed at the quality inn near the universities and wanted some pizza. Found this place on yelp.  Great NY style pizza. Family owned so they want customers to be pleased. You can get a simple garden salad for $3 and a chef salad for $3.50."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch (by myself) during a recent weekday.  The service was prompt after placing my order at the counter.  They have a few very reasonably priced lunch specials...I oped for the personal pepperoni pizza and a can of pop, but I also ordered a side salad.  The side salad came out first.  It was huge with decent ranch dressing. covering the lettuce and veggies.  Then the pizza came out.  Unfortunately for me, it had a fairly sweet tomato-based sauce and that is just not my style (I prefer a more tangy, vinegary-based sauce).  The crust was cooked just right, but the sauce just did not do it for me.  This spot is incredibly convenient if you are across the street at UPMC Presbyterian / Montefiore so if you want a low-cost meal option close by...just remember to bring your wallet as they only take cash, no credit cards."}
{"text":"Great food at relatively cheap prices. Their steak hoagie is great! I can't tell you about anything else because that is all I get!"}
{"text":"Lived on chesterfield for 3 years in college. By far, best pizza in oakland. Hours are a little weird because they cater to the lunch crows but damn was it good pizza. The cheese was amazing. Im going to miss them!"}
{"text":"Still amazing pizza, but wanted to provide more details.This place is cash only, and gets pretty busy at lunch. Hospital and university employees love it. It's a little dated looking inside. There's wood paneling on the walls, and old pictures of Pittsburgh. The appearance isn't why you go there though. It's the pizza.  My coworkers and I usually call our order in and they prep it and then when we arrive, they throw it into the oven when we are paying. The crust is crispy on the bottom, and slightly chewy. It comes out nice and hot and we all usually cut the first piece with a fork and knife because we're that anxious to start eating it.   I usually get broccoli on my pizza, but all of their toppings are good. They put a good amount of everything on there so it's not skimpy. Delicious and the price can't be beat. Unfortunately they don't have later hours, so it's mostly a lunch place for me, but it's worth checking out if you can. It's not a fancy gourmet like a lot of the newer places in the city but it's a nice simple pizza that you can sit and chat with friends while you eat."}
{"text":"My school is right down the street and we all go there for lunch. It's a great atmosphere and even greater prices. The food is phenomenal, one you have it once you will keep wanting to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good for the price! I went back two days in a row because I was excited to try to next meal.  On the first day, I ordered the one topping special with a can of soda for $6.40. The crust was puffy and chewy, the cheese with stringy, and the pepperoni was tasty. It came out piping hot and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Will definitely ordered again.  The next day I ordered 2 slices of Sicilian style pizza, one cheese, one pepperoni and a can of soda. The crust was dry for my taste. That being said, it think it cost me $4 to eat there? So worth the try.   I'll be back but I'll stick to the traditional pie. My co worker likes their chicken parm!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Oakland. That is saying a lot because there are several good places in the area. Since the location is a bit away from the center of Oakland, this place can get very busy for dining in. I have found the best time to go is about 1pm on weekdays. The hospital people usually fill the place at 11am and the office types jam the place at noon. If your going to eat there, make it a late lunch.  My only complaint is the location and like another reviewer has stated, they don't often deliver."}
{"text":"I've only tired the pizza, and it is by far the best I've had in the city! I've eaten there for over 10 years now (not every day of course ;) ).   They only take cash. They seem to always have a lunch special, i.e. personal pizza and a drink for under $7 -great for those on a budget. The location is ideal for walkers, as there is no parking."}
{"text":"If you are going to order pizza in Oakland- order from these guys- they don't usually deliver, but you can beg."}
{"text":"Small place off the beaten bath. Was recommended to me so thought I'd give it a try. Lots of options as far as sizes of the pizza go, too, which is always a plus. The pizza was fantastic. The sauce was perfect. The crust was crunchy but thick enough to hold it all together. Plenty of cheese. It was just like you'd find in NYC. The price was great, too. I'd highly recommend this place'"}
{"text":"They have sort of weird business hours, but the pizza is great. Crust is on the thin side, and they put on a generous amount of cheese."}
