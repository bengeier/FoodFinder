{"text":"Awesome scotch selection (over 140 varieties) and very friendly/knowledgable service. Cozy, warm feeling inside (referring to the ambience, not you after a few drinks - though that might also be the case). Very reasonable prices for the quality and selection. 

Great place to check out, even if you're not a scotch fan - maybe you will be afterwards."}

Nestled in the Latin quarters, you can find a huge selection on single malt scotch whiskies and beers. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, a great place to go for a drink or two. They serve 1/2 dram on most of their whiskies so you can afford to sample several without getting too intoxicated. The only thing missing is the pub style food! You can drink all night without eating some greasy food. I do have to mention that they do have 3 pre made appetizers to munch on.
I'll be back."}

{"text":"I'm not much of a scotch drinker, but after reading some other yelp reviews, I HAD to bring my boyfriend and his brother here.  They each got a tasting trio of 10, 12 and 17 year old scotch for $18.50 (the selection is updated regularly), and they loved it! There was also an irish theme beer tasting (four small glasses). The selection of wine is pretty good as well, so I was happy (about $8.50 for a pinot grigio) 
The front or the bar is more dimly lit, with darker wood and little tables and the back is classy and sleek (but was completely empty when we were there). Also, watch your step on the way to the ladies room .. There's a single step that really appears out of nowhere ;)"}
{"text":"It had been a weekend of decent beer, excellent music (Kinetik festival) and intensity on many fronts.  My traveling companion and I, both veteran liver abusers, scanned our immediate environ and noticed this place above the most understated McDonalds I'd ever seen.  We're 1.5 litres into a serious afternoon of drinking at this point, so there's my caveat with this review.

Onward:

Being the best damn decision makers on the planet at the time we wandered in and immediately realized we were someplace very special.  Always polite, however, and we were rewarded handsomely.  

However, the memories are a bit hazy -- 

Served neat in whisky tasting glasses with spring water on the side:

in order:

Lagavulin 16 year old
Glenfiddich 21-Year-Old
Glenmorangie Signet.
Armangnac from 1981

Shots of something 12 years old with bartender as we killed a bottle

Something my companion handed me that was smoky peaty, green label, Ardberg maybe?

During the entire time the bartender was warmly professional, the drinks poured precisely, and the manager came over and was very knowledgeable and accommodating.  There's a wall of Scotch behind a sliding glass door that should warn the more frugal, but was not enough to deter me, alas.  One warning -- if you seem  like you know what you're doing they won't warn you the whisky you ordered is $50 CAN per dram (Signet).

And it was completely worth it.  No, really.  Caramel, vanillins, complex smoke, light peat and a finish that is precisely like having your lower lip bitten then sucked by Josephine Baker in her prime during the wee hours of an Easter weekend in Paris while wearing little more than a feather boa.  You, not her.

If you enjoy most whisky more than most people and are up for an excellent education you could do far worse than to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon here.  

Personally, I think this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen time, and it was always fun. The staff is pleasant, the beer is good, but i can only guess the the scotch is good as i dont drink scotch. What brings me there is the free dancing classes they host there. They are very fun if you're into dancing (rock and roll and blues i think). I know they host these events on sunday and monday nights at least.
I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited this long to check out ile noire. Can I move in? I felt that comfortable, like I was hanging out in my living room, if my living room had a glass wall filled with beautiful bottles. 

When my partner in crime first mentioned that a birthday celebration being planned here for a friend, my immediate reaction was that he'd have a great time, scotch lover that he is, and I was sure they'd have something else for me. Well I had nothing to worry about, because they had lots of other options, including a nice selection of beers on tap, and decent wines both by the glass and by the bottle. I was particularly delighted by their gin list, and the option to have it on the rocks, as a gin and tonic or as a Martini. I ordered mine as a him and tonic, and I was surprised to receive a glass containing the gin and some ice, and a separate small bottle of tonic. The bottle was so cute, everyone ohhed and ahhed over it. It was also very tasty. 

I was also impressed by the fact that the music was a decent level for most of the evening, making it easy to chat, unlike many other bars. Of course the closer to midnight we got the louder the music became, but that's to be expected. The music selection was great, a mix of 80s, 90s and 00s alterna rock, a little moody at times and more upbeat at others. 

The only reason why I gave this review four stars is service. One waiter serving us was excellent. The other, not so much. It wasn't very busy when we first arrived and yet he had a major case of the grumpies. It seemed like he was avoiding us, and would occasionally come over, take one order and run away before anyone else could order. Our table often had lots of empty glasses on it. When I read through other reviews, it seems we weren't the only ones who walked out of there much more sober than we could have been if the service had been more frequent. I normally brush off bad service as someone having a bad day, but this really stood out."}
{"text":"Décor agréable en 2 déclinaisons : le devant un peu plus pub (en bois), la salle du derrière plus louge (divans), les 2 sont agréables ! Pour la boisson, une grande sélection de scotch de tous les prix et pour tous les goûts. Carte de cocktails régulière, bon choix de bières également. Shout out pour le meilleur gin tonic en ville :   servi en 2 parties et vient avec une petite bouteille de Fentimans ! C'est super chou et ça fait vraiment différent. Aussi, le goût semble meilleur, la qualité du tonic éclate en bouche !

Bon, parlons maintenant du service très basique (pour être polie). Difficile de devenir en boisson dans cet établissement. On te sert un premier verre, puis on t'oublie. Le temps que tu boive et que tu attende suffit amplement a rentrer dans les normes de consommation d'educ-alcool. promis."}
{"text":"Close by to my work, we often stop here for happy hour, since there's more than a few scotch aficionados at the office and L'ile noire has an excellent selection. From time to time, they'll have live music as well, so ends up been a pretty fun place to hang out.

While I'm not the biggest Scotch drinker, they do have a decent selection of beers to choose from.

Plus, it's super close to the Metro for you to get safely home =)"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get together with friends and/or coworkers! Great scotch selection and very friendly staff! Best appreciated if you're 21 + and especially a scotch connaisseur!!! A+++"}
{"text":"For the whiskey lover in me - I was excited to try this place out as recommended by one of the local waitresses as the \"happening whiskey place on St- Denis\". Decor was typical pub style greeted by a giant Brit flag at the entrance- dim lights. 
They have a museum of Scotch, bourbon from local to all around the world ranging from 5$ to 30$ for half glass serving.

The stars fall off my rating because of service - our waitress was really inattentive, she had no recommendations that should be signature of the staff at a whiskey bar! The bathroom was dirty on a Friday night - and ppl come here for beer more than whiskey. 

Glad to have tried it out but  I will stick to my regular whiskey hangouts than this place!"}

{"text":"Beam me up Scotchy ! or is Scotty 

Peu importe, le capitaine est fier de vous mousaillons ! Pourquoi tu dis... bien tu as réussi à trouver son ravitaillement de Scotch de qualité et ce en plein centre ville!

Le nouveau chateau de Moulinsar est plus discret sur un deuxième étage sur St-Denis par rapport au dernier mais il est beaucoup plus moderne. En été, on peut s'y déambuler à l'extérieur sur une petite terrasse le long de l'établissement.

La liste de produits est long comme mon bras gauche & droit collé en ligne avec une extension sur ma jambe droite.... dans le fond il est bien long et bien agréable à parcourir.

Amateur de TinTin ou simplement amateur de la petite $%@ de marche qui peut t'envoyer à quatre pattes dans la salle de bain, vous serez servi dans un ambiance vraiment groovy et ce à un prix relativement raisonnable. Il est certain que vous allez en faire un dram!

{"text":"This wonderful cocktail bar makes me hate France more, and love Quebec more...

We finished of our night 3 out of our 4 nights in Montreal.  The dark forest green and warm wood colors created a warm atmosphere with a slightly more upscale crowd, and the best bartenders in Montreal.  Each night the same handsome bartender, whom shall remain unnamed, welcomed us with his lovely Quebecois accent and poured us some great cocktails and whiskeys.  On the first night, he gave us some free shots, and the following nights he gave us more freebies.   Despite us being obvious tourists, he genuinely seemed interested and socialized with us each night. He never tried to oversell us, and made some great recommendations on Canadian whiskeys that were delicious yet affordable(less than $10 serving).  The other good looking bartenders were friendly too. 

Friendly French speaking bartender giving free drinks, socializing, and not overselling us?  This would NEVER happen in France.  We left nice tips, and an extra big one on our final night.  J'aime Quebec!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice always a nice little ambiance they have going on. They should how ever move that big light over the booth leading to the other room it's the only spot with a huge light and it's annoying.

They have a great selection of scotch and drinks come pretty quickly.

Place has great potential only thing that was a con last time I was there was that there was a piece of food on the floor nobody wanted to pick up all the waiters and waitresses kept stepping on it you could hear the crunch everytime lol it takes two seconds to sweep up, it was 1 am really not that busy."}

seul tout petit hic: musique un peu forte si on veut discuter :)"}

Great location.  Cozy seating areas.  Great Scotch selection.  Awesome prices.  Friendly service.  Trendy interior decoration.

This is a lounge I can definitely call home."}
{"text":"My wife and just walked in for a drink and app. I was blown away by how many spirits they had. We stayed for several drams. The waitstaff was very knowledgeable and helped me pick a few new scotch drams to go along with my preferences. I enjoyed each one. We were able to hang out and enjoy the night while sitting on the balcony without being rushed out the door. Recommended for anyone passing through Montreal and looking for a drink or two."}
{"text":"This place has great drinks and a cool atmosphere. They have the biggest gin lost I have seen in Montreal. It's trendy and fun!"}
{"text":"Pub L'ile Noire is a relaxed nightspot which has beaucoup seating. The pub has a fully-stocked bar. At the time, they were cash-only which curbed the number of drinks I had slightly, but their prices aren't out of this world. Not only were the bartenders friendly, our server drank shots with us.

I've been here twice: the first time it wasn't uber-crowded, the second time moreso (was there during Halloween). Both times were fun since I was with a good group. During Halloween, the DJ didn't seem to be receptive to song requests - or maybe he couldn't hear/understand me? On the plus side, we generally heard good music, so patrons packed onto their tiny dance floor.

Worth a visit for friendly service and reasonably priced drinks in a casual environment."}
{"text":"Was having a good time (not great beer selection but the ambiance was nice) until closing out my one half pint of cider. After I paid the bartender came over to me and my friends and asked me directly where I was from and how the service was. I said it was fine, to which she replied \"oh well normally when you experience good service you tip. (To my friends) he didn't leave a tip.\" Normally I would tip $1 per drink, if not $2 if it's a place I frequent. Tonight, I just didn't feel like it was necessarily warranted. That should NEVER warrant the kind of behavior she displayed. She wasn't even the bartender that served me! Could be a cool place, but take your money elsewhere where the staff is a little more professional."}
{"text":"The place is cool but I've never been to a place where the bar tender says she needs to be tipped especially when she was a horrible bar tender. I would avoid this place, try some better fun place down the street...."}
{"text":"J'ai passé une super soirée à l'Île Noire avec des amis. Du bourbon, du whisky, du gin, en veux-tu, en v'là! Ils ont aussi quelques bières pour celles et ceux qui aiment moins le fort. 

Par contre, elles sont vraiment chères. 8,50$ pour une pinte de Boréale, bof. Côté forts, ça allait, mais je ne suis pas familière avec les prix du whisky et compagnie, n'étant pas trop habituée de commander ça dans les bars. À vous de voir, chers amateurs et amatrices de boissons qui réchauffent le gargoton, si le prix est raisonnable.

Ce qui m'a charmée, c'est l'ambiance. L'endroit est sombre mais éclairé par les lumières du Quartier Latin et j'ai été impressionnée qu'il y ait autant de monde. La musique était juste assez forte et agréable. J'y retournerai pour plus de bourbon :)"}

Bien sûr, on retrouve toute sortes de bières locales et étrangères, du vin et même du cidre pression mais ici le scotch est à l'honneur. Il faut voir l'alignement des bouteilles de scotch dans le cellier vitré. La collection d'alcools de haute qualité est impressionnante. 

La salle du fond est idéale pour les rencontres de groupe. Le Meetup des développeurs informatiques de Montréal y a établi ses quartiers pour sa rencontre mensuelle."}
{"text":"Il y avait un temps, jadis, oú je tripais L'Île noire. Lorsque le bar était sur Ontario, c'est comme prendre un verre dans le salon de mon grand-père. On se sentait toujours la bienvenue et le staff était vraiment chaleureux. 

Depuis qu'ils sont déménagés sur la rue St-Denis, ce n'est plus pareil. Quoiqu'ils aient encore une excellente liste de whisky, ainsi qu'une bonne sélection de bières et de vins, il leur manque le côté pub écossais/rustique. C'est maintenant grand, très éclairé, chic, et impersonnel. Ils leur manque souvent du staff aussi. À chaque fois, j'ai l'impression d'attendre au moins 10 mins au bar pour commander et ils oublient souvent les commandes lorsqu'elles sont prises aux tables... J'ai vu mieux. 

Le seul aspect du nouveau lieu que j'aime est qu'il est possible de réserver la salle arrière pour des événements. 

Si non, on y va vraiment juste pour le whisky!"}
{"text":"It always seems difficult to find a bar with more than a handful of whiskeys. I was overjoyed to hear my friend say that they had 140 different kinds here, especially heavy on my favorite: scotch. At first I was disappointed that it took us awhile to get anyone to take our order, but once someone came over, he was very accommodating.

He seemed confused, but complied when we explained and asked for pickle backs (shots of whiskey followed by shots of pickle juice). I also didn't realize that the $18 whiskey tasting flight was only for whatever distillery they had chosen to highlight on the board. The bartender let me do a flight of the brand I chose, Glengoynes (10, 12, 14) for only $20. 

I really wish we had gone one more time before leaving Montreal, and I will certainly come back if i'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a random Saturday night and I am glad that we did. The local swing dancing club was having a meeting and it was fantastic to watch! This bar has a great bourbon and scotch selection and the bartender who was also DJing a little bit was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here due to their expansive scotch list.  But I was a little disappointed when the bartender put the device on the bottle to pour my scotch.  Maybe this is a Canadian thing, but this almost never happens in the US.  I ended up with a very small pour of the scotch I tried.  Decent vibe, but a little slow and quiet compared to what's going on around it.  I could see a time and a place for this bar, but it just wasn't what I was looking for when I went."}
{"text":"Outstanding Gin selection and great bartending! Very lively atmosphere right up until closing time."}
{"text":"This is an amazing bar for those that adore scotch, this lounge had at least four pages of scotch if I remember correctly. I think I may have posted photos of the scotch list on yelp under this business, so go take a look if you're curious. 

  My hubs is a scotch lover, giving the true Scotsmen a run for their money. He could drink scotch all night and remain himself throughout. We had been wandering around the neighborhood looking at all the sights after seeing Dr. Steve Bruhle. Not sure of the spelling, it has been a few months since we attended that show. So after the show we contemplated what to do with the rest of our night, Opening the yelp app caused for an overwhelming list of places we could go. So I put away my phone and let chance run wild and decided to let life take us wherever it may. 

   I noticed a small group of people down an alley and decided that was the alley we would traverse in hopes of finding a rad out of the way spot with mostly locals and few tourists. I'm glad I listened because we stumbled upon l'ile Noire. We walked in, went up a few stairs and entered a large open room filled with tables. At the rear of the room was a large glass wall that allows you to see right into the wine room, which looked awesome illuminated. The green and brown tones of the glass bottles filled with wines cascaded soft shadows on the floor. It is truly a beautiful design. 

   We opted to sit at the bar area, which is L shaped with an elevated seating area at the base of the L. Once we sat a friendly waitress came over, offered us menus and gave us a moment to pour over our options. My Husband ordered a scotch neat. I don't know which one he went for, I do know that it was aged for as long as both of us have been alive and it smelled like a just smoked interior of a wine and/or whiskey barrel. I'm not a scotch fan, so to me it smelled like a campfire. I had a beer that is impossible to find stateside, as I was trying to try everything that you can't get stateside while on holiday in MTL. 

   We ended up talking to the waitress and another patron at the bar about all the places we needed to see, and those we should avoid like the plague. We received some useful information, which helped us determine a plan for the following day. After our conversation ended, the three of us bar patrons went on to another establishment that our newly befriended guide insisted was a must see.  

   I love this lounge, I call it that because the vibe was mellow, relaxed and felt more like hanging out at your friends ultra chic apartment and less like a bar in the middle of a pretty hopping party area. 

   This is a must stop on my next trip, and if I ever find myself up there on business or another holiday I will be sure to stop in for a glass of wine, since the list was massive and contained quite a few awesome listings."}
{"text":"Ile Noire is a classy professional spot with charming staff and an exceptional scotch menu located on a convenient, vibrant stretch of St Denis. The front room feels very business, but the back opens up into a more comfortable candle-lit brasserie vibe where, in addition to the extensive bar with rare and affordable options for scotch drinkers, they offer simple snacks eg; a small mason jar of herbed goat cheese served with crackers. I've found the staff attentive and jovial and 0 stress. The music the last time I was there was all 80s and 90s throwbacks, an odd but good-humored choice given the chic atmosphere."}
{"text":"L'Île Noire vous offre une vingtaine de bières en fût du Québec, de l'Irlande et de l'Angleterre. Par contre, la spécialité de la maison c'est le Scotch Whisky. Plus d'une centaine au menu, impressionnant. Proposé en dram et demi-dram. 

Un dram est une unité de mesure utilisée pour de petites quantités de liquides. Dans le cas du Scotch Whisky, un dram = 30 ml = 1,014 fl oz. Hé! C'est 0,43 ml de plus de ce précieux nectar. 

Pour déguster, penser au trio. Une sélection de trois Scotchs avec leur description gustative. Très intéressant, pour faire de nouvelles découvertes. Un petit conseil, débuté par le Scotch le plus vieux, car les saveurs sont plus subtiles que les plus jeunes. À déguster sans glace et avec un bon verre d'eau, bien évidemment.

L'emplacement lui-même, ayant emménagé dans de nouveaux locaux il y a plus de deux ans, tout est neuf. l'Île Noire, a perdu un peu de son cachet que lui conférait l'ancien emplacement. Par contre, une fois le choc initial passé, l'on remarque rapidement que l'endroit est moins intimidant et très élégant: plancher en bois, deux bars, tables en bois, chaises, bancs et banquettes. Tout pour satisfaire votre fessier. Dans la partie arrière, il y a une petite scène où l'on présente des groupes, entre autres lors du Festival de jazz. 

L'été, vous pouvez déguster vos breuvages divins dans la petite ruelle de pavé uni, elle donne sur la grande bibliothèque. 

C'est mon bar de prédilection pour le scotch pour ses prix raisonnables, mais avant tout sa vaste sélection."}

Off the beaten path...hit up this block when the Latin Quarter gets nutzo."}

Deep mahogany colors on the velvety seats and booths and walls.  I only went into the back for a minute but it looked more lively and open. 

I had my very first boilermaker.  Sure we didn't drink it properly but it was still great.  If you 
like Scotch I highly recommend this place.

We sat up by the front windows and it was perfect!  I really enjoy people watching so what better place to do it than on the second floor looking down at the bustling Saint-Denis.  

Price wise, again, it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"A casual place in one of the busiest stretches of Rue St Denis. They have a small patio overlooking the street and comfortable booths inside. The scotch list is incredible and what's even better is that the prices are reasonable.
There are several beers on tap. 
The food menu is small, but if you're into having a few drinks and love scotch, I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fantastic scotch, but the food wasn't good and quite pricey"}
{"text":"140 types of Whiskey from all over the world. So basically the pornographic version of heaven...

A Whiskey lover can't lose in this place."}
{"text":"Probably the best scotch location in Montreal, in my experience. Great selection, passable prices, good service, and large enough that you don't need to be particularly concerned with getting a spot. For a scotch night downtown, this would easily be my default option."}
{"text":"Went here with a crew of Yelpers and had a great experience. As a big scotch drinker, I'm surprised it took me so long to discover this gem of a place - the fact that it's directly above a McDonalds probably didn't help.

Amongst other things, I had their scotch taster (3 different scotches 10-15 years old from the same distillery) which was great value at $18 - it even comes with a set of tasting notes. As mentioned in other reviews this place is good value when it comes to scotch, and the menu is extensive.

The place is nicely done up; the front section is cosy with a pub feel, while the back area is a bit more modern - the whole place looks very new."}

Scotch, Single Malt, Whisky. 
Cheap Seagram to 50 yr old scotch. passing on the average and the excellent They got ONE impressive list of Whisky/Scotch/Whiskey/ 
Lot of Pub also has one of those but hey, they have the best and the cheapest!
a quick example: 1.25 once of Lagavulin 16 yr old is 9$ there and 20$ in another pub I won't quote. 
They always have a scotch degustation or specials that are pretty neat and not expensive.

Wait you don't drink scotch? You're more into classic drinks or Cider or beer? They also have a home-brewed beer which is actually pretty good.

The place is confy (couches in the corners). The service is friendly and good. They will make a tab for you if you don't want to get for Credit card or interact card all the time. The music is pretty decent even thought it's a jukebox.

NB: If you had too much drink, careful with the step! I almost squashed a group of young Beautiful Women"}
{"text":"L'Ile Noire boasts cozy pub ambience and an extensive selection of Scotch whiskies.  The drinks list also covers some of the representative whiskeys, bourbons etc from other parts of the globe.  We sampled some really good Irish whiskey while there.  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and prepared to provide helpful suggestions.  

The pub is relatively large.  There are normally at least one or two spare tables, even on busy evenings.  The area at the back is substantially quieter and recommended for those seeking a quiet drink and conversation."}
{"text":"If you're a scotch drinker then you must come here.  They have an extensive list of scotch from various regions that will satisfy you.  For those like myself who have never been a fan of it there is still a decent variety of other drinks to choose from.  They have a good selection of gins and there was a fair number of beers on tap.  There wasn't much in terms of food so make plans to eat elsewhere f you come.  The prices are incredibly reasonable.  My pint of beer which they had brewed themselves was only $4.50 and it was pretty good.  It's definitely worth checking this establishment out when you get the chance."}

À l'occasion d'un CMYE ... bravo encore Katherine B ! ....... nous nous retrouvons à l'île noire, un charmant pub mais très sombre en entrant, sans accueil à l'entrée. On choisi notre propre place. On se demande où on est, dans un décor un peu rétro-moderne malheureusement avec un bruit de fond assez fort, qui semble typique des pubs mais à oublier pour un tête à tête, suffisamment bruyant pour qu'on doive monter le son de notre conversation ! Ils auraient eu avantage à se baser sur le concept intelligent du Royal Merchant, encore inégalé en terme de lieux et d'environnement.

La panoplie de bière et de spiritueux de l'Île est plus qu'impressionnante ! Quoi prendre ? J'ai faim !! commençons par des rillettes de canard accompagnées d'un Prosecco. Divin !!! Malheureusement, attendez-vous à devoir redire votre commande au serveur, il a des pertes de mémoires, vous pouvez recevoir la bière d'un autre. Mes rillettes de canard arrivent accompagnées de petits cornichons marinés à l'aneth et d'un grand bol de tranchettes de baguettes. C'est parfait ! Dès la première bouchée de rillettes, une sensation crémeuse et riche envahit votre palais, une arôme de gras de canard \"s'orgasmise\" sur vos papilles et c'est le bonheur qui vous guide vers l'extase gastrique. Vous lixiviez le tout avec un bon Prosecco bien sec, c'est parfait. Ceux qui me connaissent bien savent que je mangerais des rillettes jusqu'à l'explosion totale tellement c'est bon.

Malheureusement, notre serveur en perte de mémoire a oublié mon grand verre d'eau bien glacée pour que je puisse me désaltérer avant la transition vers mon bon whisky. Trop tard, pas de Whisky non plus. Si la commande ne se fait pas dans l'ordre, la liste s'arrête. Ce sera donc pour une prochaine fois, si le temps se présente ! Mais disons qu'avec autant de bruit ambiant, il y a moins de chance que j'y retourne en tête à tête. On finit la soirée assez fatigué.

Tuesday october 10th 2013

For a nice CMYE ...... congrats to Katherine B ! .......... we all gather to l'Île noire, a nice secluded pub (on a second floor) but really dark as you enter, without any host at the door. You choose your own place. One can ask him(her)self where one is in such a retro-modern decor with a loud surrounding noise seems typical of pubs, to be forgotten for a cosy warm evening between lovers. YOU WILL HAVE TO RAISE YOUR VOICE ! They should have rethink their concept on Royal Merchant, still to me the best in environnement.

The beer and alcohol list is most impressive. What to choose ? I'm hungry, I'll pick some nice duck rillettes with a chilled Prosecco. Divine !!! Unfortunately, you might receive the glass of someone else if your waiter has memory loss, like I did. The rillettes were Hmmmmmmmm, and accompanied with some tiny pickles and a big bowl of baguette slices. Perfect ! With the first bite, a rich and creamy sensation slowly engulf your mouth with a pefectly distributed duck fat taste \"orgasmyzing\" your taste buds until gastric extazy. Lixiviating the mixt with a nice and dry Prosecco, perfection. Those who know me well, know I would eat rillette until I blow up, it's that good.

Unfortunately, our memory-loss waiter forgot my nice-icy-tall glass of water so I could prepare for my whisky transition finish. Too late. If the order is not filled in order, the list stops right there. It's going to be for a next time, if I'm in the area, but with that much noise it's not the place for a romantic evening. You end the night still tired."}
{"text":"Scotchy, scotch, scotch...

L'Île Noire se veut un pub où il fait bon prendre une bière mais j'y ai surtout remarqué la sélection de scotchs. Ne vous vous trompez pas, ça n'est pas un pub anglais vieillot, mais plutôt un pub moderne où vous en vous sentez pas mal à l'aise si vous êtes bien habillés parce que vous revenez d'aller voir un spectacle, ou bien parce que vous planifiez une grosse soirée. Parfait pour y aller avec un group d'amis (ils prennent des réservation pour les gros groupes) ou même en tête à tête amoureux.

Vous pouvez y choisir le menu de dégustation de whisky qui vous permet d'essayer quelques scotchs différents, tout en ayant une petite fiche d'information qui vous permet de savoir ce que vous buvez. Pour ceux comme moi qui ne boivent pas vraiment de whisky à part pour un bon verre glacé de Sortilège de temps en temps, il y a une très bonne sélection de bières (époustouflante en fait!) qui parviennent d'un peu partout à travers le monde. Quand j'y suis allée, c'est le Black Velvet qui était la boisson gagnante de la soirée (moitié Guinness et cidre), mais en fait, c'est la compagnie qui a fait de cette soirée, un moment inoubliable ;)"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est toujours top notch. Le personnel connait bien ses scotchs et gins. J'ai déjà organisé un lancement dans la salle arrière et ils nous ont laissé beaucoup de liberté. Superbe expérience!"}
{"text":"Très belle place pour les amateurs de whiskys. On a l'embarras du choix.
Les prix sont corrects.
J'y suis allé deux soirs de suite, j'avais besoin de me réchauffer avant d'affronter la météo pourrie =)"}
{"text":"Excellent. Beaucoup de bons choix et de précieux conseils des barmans. J'y suis allée pour une réunion d'affaires et j'y retournerai avec grand plaisir !"}
{"text":"Tres cozy , lumieres tamisées etc. J'aime la petite terrasse sur le coté. Vaste choix des boissons alcoolisés. Chandelles sur les tables, romantique."}
{"text":"I have been a client and fan for over 9 years now.  They have recently moved locations from Ontario to St Denis.  The staff and owners are really great and welcoming and have been there for a long time so they never hesitate to introduce people making you feel right at home.
The beer selection is varied enough for most people to find a pint, but they specialize in Scotch.  They have the biggest selection I have seen in Montreal, and they have regular events, sponsored by companies for tastings.  One of these was attended by my hubby and Poodle, he (Kobe the poodle) ended up with a Jameson t-shirt, and a photo on their website.  Other important events include the St Patrick's day celebrations.  The decor of the new place is more modern than pub-by, and has more of an upscale look, but the warmth for which they are known is still the key attribute."}
{"text":"Un pub écossais en plein Quartier Latin...?! Eh bien, je suis plutôt surprise! 
Mais Oh combien mes papilles gustatives furent ravies de cette petite soirée, où chaque verre fut d'un délice total et ce à un prix très abordable!
Leur liste de boisson est extra, chacun sera satisfait qu'importe ses préférences gustatives. 
Je fus aussi agréablement surprise quant au décors, qui est un genre de traditionnel revisité en moderne. 
La musique et la lumière n'étaient pas trop fortes ni pas assez:  quel plaisir que fut la possibilité de discuter sans hurler tout en étant capable de distinguer les traits du visage de ma date!"}
