{"text":"Outstanding food.  Haughty, inattentive service.

The cheese menu is wonderful, as was the Sweet Pea Ravioli.  I remember thinking the  Basque Style Brandade was lovely at the time, but can't honesty recall this dish today.  I do remember it tasting of the sea with a light and fluffy texture.

The chocolate mousse was not good, perhaps baking does things that destroy the texture expected with mousse.  The Brandade had a lighter texture.  The disappointing texture and flavor of the dessert were insult to injury after waiting an inexcusable amount of time to finish to an otherwise enjoyable meal.

The decor is tasteful, an interesting mix of old and new, geometric and organic.

It was an expensive evening with wine, cheese and a few tapas, but we loved most of the meal despite our waiter's demeanour and lack of attention."}
{"text":"I've been to Divino a few times, mostly for wine in their lounge. 
Located in the historic buildings along Stephen Avenue, Divino is a very upscale place, and I love all the brick facades inside. 
They have an impressive selection of fine wines from around the globe. So if you ever want to impress anyone, take them here and just order any wine off the menu, because they have all been hand-selected and not one will disappoint. 
In the lounge, they have a few appetizers to choose from to go with your wine, and here's where I start raving. Get the green beans. Trust me! They tempura batter and fry fresh green beans and serve them like french fries with a grainy mustard dipping sauce - it is to die for! They have pretty good pommes frites too, but at the end of the day, they're just fries. 
The one time I've eaten here I had the black pepper linguine with chicken and tomatoes in a creamy sauce, and it was terrific. They give you a pretty big portion, too! 
This definitely is not the kind of place to show up in sweatpants, but it's not so stuffy that you would feel uncomfortable. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, the food's great, and the wine is even better."}
{"text":"This restaurant has always been a favorite to take clients for lunch but it is fast becoming my go to restaurant anytime I am downtown. They have been one of the few places that has found the balance between casual and fine dining. The servers are friendly but not syrupy and they know their wine selection. Everything I have tried on the menu or on special has been fantastic and I never miss an opportunity to order the Tempura Haricot Verts. I give this restaurant a two shorty thumbs up on all fronts - service, food, wine and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here as a group of 6 and had a lovely dinner as the food was absolutley amazing.
However the server we had - didnt catch a name and wasnt told - Male maybe mid 30s was awful.
It was as if he was high on something to be honest and did annoy us in the end.
It took away from the experience of the meal. It wasn't on one or two occasions either but throughout the entire meal. Some examples are - One of the other ladies with me waited for 10 mins for him to come over to us for napkin when our main courses were set down!! He caught all of us trying to excuse him but simply ignored us; he left all the appitizer plates and cutlery in front of us for a prolonged period of time( I know it was a saturday night and busy but in the end we had to stack them in the middle of the table for him to remove them!Everyone had finished eating for a long length of time); paying the bill he did not make it clear what payment methods were/where to pay and made it very awkward(this situation was one of us wanted to pay by debit and he made a bit of a scene saying we all would have to come to the front of the restaurant to pay altogether. This was fine as we were ready to leave but he was not happy explaining this to us!Very strange) .
I would love to come to Divino again for the food only but based on my experience this weekend I would find it hard to make it justifiable as it is not a cheap dining experience.
I feel when you are paying that much for a dining experience that both the food and service should be at the same level and unfortunatley at Divino it was not.
Menu options I would advise - tempura green beans, olives,any of the cheeses, lobster starter with scallop, foie gras starter."}
{"text":"Divino earns a solid three in my book. I couldn't have any wine, so I can't speak to their wine list but it seemed pretty extensive. Their cheese selection is very good and features a number of local and Canadian choices. A+. 

They were also very good about serving a large group (ten of us) and splitting our bill without making a fuss about it. There was also no mandatory gratuity applied (unusual for a restaurant with a group that size). 

The downsides: the BC Salmon with risotto was okay but nothing to write home about. The salmon was a little bit dry and the risotto a little bit bland. Not a $31 meal, really. The other thing is the confusing entryway/bathrooms. Rather than label their washrooms in any way clearly, they put them behind two blank doors: one door has a naked man for a handle, one has a naked woman. Incidentally, a naked man bent into the shape of a handle sort of looks as if he's already relieving himself - a precursor for what lies behind door number two!

The open kitchen is fun and provides a nice ambiance but it's very loud in there. Not good for intimate dinner conversation for sure.

Go for the great cheese selection and have some of the rabbit meatballs - I tasted a bit of one and they were delicious and moist!"}
{"text":"Great first experience.  We had the privilege of being served by Brett.  He was very suave and knowledgeable.  He ensured that neither our water nor wine glass was ever empty.  He was kind enough to let us stick around even after we had settled the bill.  In fact, he stopped by to make sure we were still doing okay once he was off-shift.

I didn't order any food, but the wine was superb.  I look forward to going back for a nice wine & meal pairing.

Less one star because the bathrooms were a little unsavory in the cleanliness department. 

Thanks for keeping our glasses full, Brett!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a snack last week. First I had their cocktail, I can't remember the name but it was the Tokyo one and omg it was delicious. I could drink a gallon of it! We shared the foie Gras ravioli which was super rich but very tastey. Our mains were also superb. I would definitely go back to eat but mostly drink that cocktail!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with colleagues and I ordered the mussels & frites.  I think it was an appetizer but I couldn't have eaten anything else!  The mussels were cooked perfectly and the broth was very tasty.  The lemony mayo with the frites were a highlight and I asked the waiter if they might have a vat of it to go!"}
{"text":"Overall experience was really good.   Food was great, service was also good.   

They didn't have the Gin I wanted for the martini (I don't recommend the Phrog gin!  Ugh) and the kitchen was backed up so the dinner took a looonnnggg time.  

Still, the wine was tasty, the company good, so the wait wasn't noticed.   Will go back."}
{"text":"Yet another great restaurant that focuses on local foods. Professional and knowledgable staff, who are more than happy to give you suggestions if you, like me are overwhelmed by the wine list. 
The lobster cannelloni is killer!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Great food!  I've liked almost everything I've ordred there.. I wasn't crazy about their lamb confit melt sandwich as the bread was quite soggy so I had to eat it with a fork and knife.

My favourite dish is their black pepper linguine with chicken, tomatoes, and spinach in a light cream sauce. Apparently, the make their pasta fresh.. and this dish is consistent time after time (I've had it on several occasions).  I also love their tempura haricot vert. They are very addictive.

This is a great place for business lunches or drinks in the early evening. As well, they wine selection is huge. They offer an excellent selection of cheese as well to pair with the wine.

The decor is very nice.. very stylish and contemporary. This is one of my favourite restaurants in the downtown core. It's a place I would take someone for lunch because I know I can count on them to deliver quality service."}
{"text":"Went to Divonos at the end of a team building event. There were 40 people on our group. We had a private room in the basement. The staff were attentive, swevice was spot on, the food was fantastic! 

I have been here several times before in the main dining room with smaller parties and am never disappointed.  This is the place you want to take people to impress in a casual upscale way."}
{"text":"Came here with co-workers for dinner.  They have an excellent wine and cheese selection (as expected) but a good variety of mains as well.  I skipped the appies going straight for a well cooked lamb as my entree and finished it with a simple dessert.  The dessert was not particularly memorable, I can't remember what I ordered, but the lamb was very well cooked and I'd have it again.  Next time I'd try to rabbit as well and order more cheeses."}
{"text":"If I had unlimited resources, and the ability to digest freakish amounts of wine, cheese and creme broulee, I would say Divino employees would know my name...and yet some already do. I LOVE this place. 
Although seemingly posh posh, the wait staff was very patient as my friends and I chose our cheese platter (having to ask the waiter many many questions) and suggested some great wine pairings for them. Although fantastic any time of year, I would recommend going in the winter, as there is something truly magical about the brick interior strewn about with white lights when it is snowing outside. Love."}
{"text":"Gourmet dishes with a twist. Delicious food, meh to the service. So much to choose from...and it's not so simple. They're crafted with all these different flavours: Pulled rib burgers, salads, roasted chicken, steak, pasta you name it.   Such a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends. 

I'd definitely come back for the wine and cheese plates though. Next time."}
{"text":"Divino - Distractingly Divine

If you are not a wine drinker, lactose intolerant, and enjoy boxed macaroni and cheese, don't bother visiting Divino's!

I've been to Divino Wine and Cheese Bistro a few times, usually during summer, sitting outside for lunch or for a glass of wine when I'm downtown for meetings.  I've never bothered to review the bistro before, but after consistent and distinctive service I feel that it deserves attention and my accolades.
 . 
The bistro is situated in an historic downtown building on 8th Avenue and is beautifully restored. The interior design and furniture is contemporary and complements the old building elements, creating a stylish and vibrant bistro atmosphere. 

The wine menu, bistro food, cheese choices and service are exceptional. In fact I think that Divino has one of the finest wine and cheese menus' in Calgary. If only they had a caviar menu as well, life here would have a more decadent and meaningful purpose.  

However, Wine and Cheese is what they are about! Even though, the Bacon Roasted Chicken Breast Sandwich I had for lunch the other day was superbly prepared and presented. The waiter (I hate the word Server, it's demeaning) was mature, attentive, unobtrusive and knowledgeable. Something sadly lacking at many restaurants in Calgary today. The emphasis being on legs, and short skirts, and not service. 

Divino is part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Resorts Group. I strongly recommend this bistro and wine bar to international businessmen visiting Calgary. It's a world class and distractingly divine and sophisticated hangout in Calgary."}
{"text":"Divino does  a very nice duck or pheasant when available. I was taken aback to find such well done bird outside of France and glad I found. 

Everything I have tried has been very well prepped and displayed so I'm genuinely a fan. And since cheese and vino are my soft spots there isn't a better place in Calgary I've found."}
{"text":"I learned about the interesting history of Divino during a Calgary Ghost Tour, so when a gf suggested having a group dinner there I figured \"Why not?\"

The four of us arrived during peak dining time on a weeknight, and it was pretty packed so I took that as a good sign. We were seated near the open concept kitchen and got to see (and smell!) all the delicious creations whiz past us as we pondered on the menu.

In the mood for wine (what a perfect place to be!), our waiter brought over their house sommelier who was not only knowledgeable but super helpful and friendly! He helped us settle on the Kruger Rumpf Riesling (FYI - a must try!)

We got the Tempura Haricot vert to share (seriously, could have just ordered a few of these for my meal), my entrée was the rougie duck breast (served with gingered spaghetti squash, potato confit and raspberry jus) while the other girls got the lamb sirloin, seafood spaghettini and lobster ravioli.

At first glance, you think the portions are small but once you start devouring your food, the richness takes over and you realize the portions are just right. My duck was succulent and the ginger and raspberry were perfect accents. All of you know my reservations about lamb, but I snuck a bite and was glad I did! The mint and red current jus did wonders on the lamb! 

Too full for dessert, I did ask to look at the cheese menu (what a huge variety!) so I know what to look forward to the next time I'm here - and trust me, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great variety of wine. Servers understand wine and pairing with foods. Excellent service and food comes with a price tag but this place was worth it. If we are ever in Calgary again we will come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner but most recently was here for lunch.

The food was delicious-decent portions, fresh and very flavourful. I had the BC salmon with risotto and everything was perfectly done. My lunch mates had the chicken sandwich, the gnocchi, and one guest had soup and the marinated anchovy starter plate. Everyone seemed very happy with their meal and everything was eaten pretty quickly. Two of our group had dessert and both deserts looked super delish-made me a bit jealous I had declined.

The service was okay. Really, with the food prices and the level of restaurant Divino's is, it should be better. If they were more off the beaten track, they wouldn't get away with the service they offer. We waited a long time for anyone to take our drink order and even longer for our food order to be taken. The server we had seemed stressed when asked help one of our guests make a choice and seemed like she was too busy for that. I think she actually was too busy-many of the servers were running hard-perhaps adding a couple of more would make the service better? They weren't bad servers, they just seemed really under pressure.

The other weird thing was the line up on arrival. The hostess also had to answer phone which she couldn't do and greet people at the same time. So a huge cluster of people stood waiting while the restaurant sat pretty empty (it was the start of lunch rush). Maybe not the best set up.
I would come back here but maybe not for lunch as lunch in an hour + here seems impossible and I hate seeing servers so frantic."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine and great service.

We were a group of 6 and we had a relaxed dinner.  The appetizers included rabbit meatballs, which were very good.  We then had a pasta course and it was tasty and well presented.  The main courses demonstrated a diverse menu with each dish satisfying.  The desserts were also first rate.  There was not an issue with any of the dishes.

Our waiter demonstrated a tremendous knowledge of the menu, and the wine list.  He was quite helpful throughout without hovering.  He was a pro.  

The entire experience was first rate."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Calgary on business, we take my customer here...it's one of our favorites.  Whether we find ourselves having apps and drinking wine, or indulging in their entrees, Divino's never disappoints.  We always have to start with the tempura green beans, and frites...oh so good.  I had the BC salmon (some of the best I've ever enjoyed), and the rest of my party had the gnocchi, chicken, and the evening's special-carbonara.  All were amazing.  Wine was fabulous, a recommendation from our waiter when we asked for a northern Italian red.  Only reason I did not give five stars is the waiter forgot about the dessert we ordered.  But...We will always be back!"}
{"text":"Has the chefs appetizer speciality for the night. Highly recommend trying whatever creation Dave makes, he truly knows what he is doing with bringing together flavours and making tender meat. We also had the butterscotch budino for dessert. Was amazing, not a big dessert person but this was delicious!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place, came for lunch and ordered the peppered linguine but was mildly disappointed, lacked flavor to me and just tasted plain. The bread basket was impressive though and my dessert that consisted of a raspberry tart and cappuccino was quite delicious and fresh.
 I love the location so ill be back to try something else!  The service was great too."}
{"text":"A couple of us stopped in to Divino for a couple (okay, okay, a FEW) glasses of wine the other night. I had never been here before and I was extremely impressed.

Not only do they offer an extensive wine and cheese menu, but they also offer a wide variety of entrees, gourmet sandwiches, and desserts.

Best described as a bustling bistro, Divino sets the bar very high. Between the professional staff, classic decor and exceptional menu options, Divino is the perfect place to go when you're in the mood to kick your night up a notch or two."}
{"text":"I think Divino's may be my favourite downtown restaurant.  Always delicious, great cheese selection and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great service! 

We ate too much. It was so well worth it and the high price tag too!

Will go back again and again since we always leave happy and full :)"}
{"text":"It was my first week in Calgary last week. I have temporarily left my Toronto life to work out here for 4 months, and this was my first dining out experience.

 Oxtail gnocchi with butternut squash? YES! It was everything I wished for and more. My friend and I walked in here after feeling unwelcome at the restaurant next door (Blink) because we did not have reservations. Divino took us in! We didn't try the cheese or the wine. I know I know. It's a wine and cheese bistro! But based on the quality of the food and the atmosphere (not our server...she didn't even crack a smile the entire time we were there), I will definitely be back for the wine and the cheese. 

Hooray to my first dinner in Calgary! 'Twas a success."}
{"text":"Lobster cannoli was luke warm and had a fishy taste. Expensive for the quality. Nice decor."}
{"text":"This place rocks server told us they are closing the doors this Saturday. Too bad. Great cheese place and pretty good selection of wine. How can this bistro go out of business? Servers were pretty nice too. Oh well guess I will have to go to blink now."}
{"text":"Wow, everything everyone else says is true.  Exceptional wine and cheese list, fantastic attentive service and comforting decor.  I tried the lobster cannelloni as my entree and it did not disappoint.  The banana butter tart for dessert was very good."}
{"text":"Traveling from California.  Perhaps one of the best meals ever here.  Fresh Red Snapper over zucchini risotto.  Also a fantastic creative martini along with cheese selection.  Extensive wine list with some world class wines. Just really impressed.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for wine and cheese and had a great experience.  We sat at the bar and the bartender took good care of us.  We both enjoyed a nice glass of wine and shared 3 cheeses - a triple cream, a taleggio and a manchego...yummy!  The space is really nice - I loved the exposed brick walls and the simple, but elegant decor."}
{"text":"a main stay good fresh food. this last trip had poorer service but the food was great."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty pasta for lunch.   Can't say it was the best I've had but it was certainly above average.  Good service and nice atmosphere.  We were in and out fairly quickly at lunch time so that is a benefit.
The tempura beans were unique and tasty for an appy.
Food 3.5 but with the service and atmosphere bumps them up to a 4.0."}
{"text":"We went here this past week for birthday cocktails and the bartender was was extremely rude! We didn't have any food, and the cocktails were good, but the bartender made us feel like we were unwanted and an inconvenience. Beside his poor treatment of us, we heard him loudly speaking rudely about a coworker to the manager. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to Divino! It's funny that I don't come often, but then find myself walking by and thinking to myself, \"I like Divino so much, who don't I come here more?!?\"  They have a great wine list, and their servers are very knowledgeable and attentive. They don't have the biggest menu, but everything in it is impeccable and delicious. My personal faves are the tempura green beans and butter poached lobster."}
{"text":"Ordered what I thought would be bouillabase but got a very tired soup with a meagre portion of dry overcooked seafood.Service was alright but did not make up for the food."}
{"text":"Just popped in for wine and cheese on a sunny afternoon. Asked the staff for suggestion. Was really impressed with what I got: three cheeses and two half glasses of wine which paired perfectly. Really nice ambience, friendly and knowledgeable bar staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by Divino on a weeknight for some wine and cheese and we ended up getting dinner here as well. Restaurant is really cute. It's dim and cozy and our waiter was so nice. We had a few glasses of red wine and the cheese board. Love how they have a cheese menu with descriptions of each cheese. Makes decision making a little easier. Instead of your typical white bread, they serve a cinnamon/raisin loaf that was so good. We also ordered the salmon and it was good. I hate when places over cook salmon and this was cooked perfectly. Really enjoyed my time here!"}
{"text":"Divino Wine & Cheese Bistro, part of Canadian Rocky Mountain Resorts (CRMR) family of companies, originally opened in 1984 as a quaint 30 seat restaurant, located in downtown Calgary' Grain Exchange building. Divino has since relocated to the historic Calgary Wine and Spirits building on Stephen Avenue. I have wanted to come here every since I stayed at CRMR's Buffalo Mountain Lodge in Banff way back in 1994. 

I got my chance a few weeks ago as part of yet another Team Dinner within a very long business trip that found me in Calgary and North of Fort McMurray.  Like every thing else fine dining-wise in Calgary, it was spendy, even considering the expense account. At the same time, I loved the energy, the nice seating we had in back, the good service, fun, tasty, and well presented food, and featuring one of the better  wine lists that I had seen in Calgary. 

Regarding the Wine, I was the designated selector for our Group, because they figured that since I live in Northern California, I know just enough to be dangerous when a wine list is put in front of me. However, whether it's because of the taxes, the pretense, or the distance to the vineyards, a decent bottle of wine is too damn expense in these parts. And what's with the relatively slim selection of good Canadian wines on these wine lists?

Anyway, until next time and maybe at the Emerald Lake Lodge with Gayle....."}
{"text":"I usually have a tough time finding something I want to order at Divino.  That's my problem, not yours.  I'm a picky eater.  That being said, I had a great meal at Divino the other night.  We ordered the frites as an appetizer and then I had pasta for dinner; my wife had the rib-eye.  Both were very good.  The service was perfect.  The wine list is a book so there's lots to choose from at the higher end.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Tempura beans!  What a delicious idea. 
I could have ate them all night. 
The staff makes great wine suggestions and is very knowledgeable!   Probably would have never found this place if I wasn't stumbling around Stephen ave with some comrades!   The $35.00 cheese plate blew my mind and the button on my pants.  Great for a lovely sit down or a full blown high class dinner. 

Yum.   Cheese and wine."}
{"text":"We didn't know where to go for dinner and drinks Friday night so our hotel recommended this place - I'm sure glad they did!  It was around 6:30pm and we were able to walk right into an intimate table at the back. The place is dimly lit with many small tables - perfect for a romantic little date night too!

Their wine list goes on forever!  Our server was amazing answering all of our questions on tastes and flavours of both reds and whites. 

They have a cheese menu to build your own cheese board so that was really fun. Again, our server's knowledge of all the cheeses and which ones paired nicely was fantastic. The cheese came with fresh baked bread which had a hint of cinnamon with it. Was so good, though didn't pair with one of our cheeses at all, so I didn't feel like that cheese had a fair shot against the others. You can also purchase the cheese you had tried for home! 

I had the hazelnut crusted halibut for my entree and it came with pea and mushroom risotto. Amazing. The halibut was cooked perfectly and the flavours of the risotto were delish!  

If I were to come down to Calgary again I would for sure come back here for both dinner or just wine and cheese :)"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was probably among the worst I've experienced in a long time. We received our drinks and firsts quickly but the plates were empty and our glasses were dry long before our meals showed up. We waited with nothing to eat or drink for nearly 45 minutes. The food was dropped off by someone other than our waiter and our drinks we weren't even asked about our drinks. I had to flag the waiter down as he walked by and ask for new drinks. He brought them and promptly disappeared without inquiring about the quality of the meal. We thought about ordering dessert but by the time our server returned we thought it safest to just get the bill and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What I hope is a rare miss...

Went here last night for my wife's birthday and had a less than average experience. 

First off, the service from the staff was awesome!  No issues there. 

The starters were amazing. We had muscles and buffalo tartare and both were flavorful and presented very well. 

The mains were just 'ok'. I had a bone in rib steak and she had the duck. The beef was not AAA quality as there was much gristle but very flavorful. It was cooked well, just a bad piece of meat. The duck had a good sauce but lacked our usual expectation for quality of the duck meat. 

While finishing our meal, the restaurant was filled with smoke from the kitchen cutting our stay short. 

Anyway, we have had many great experiences here. Hoping this was just a rare miss as we like to come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! A friend of mine and I went there prior to going to the theatre and we arrived late. They were more than accommodating to make sure we were fed and out in time for the play. The lyonnaise salad was amazing, so delicious! I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection. My friend had the halibut which she loved as well. Perfect in every way! I loved it so much that I am going again this week with 2 friends before another play. I'm ordering the lyonnaise salad all to myself this time, not sharing at all :) thank you so much for all your hard work at keeping up the excellent standards you are known for."}
{"text":"I expect way better food when I'm paying $30 for lunch.

I went there for lunch with a few colleagues and couldn't have been more disappointed. The service was terribly slow and the restaurant was so loud that it was nearly impossible to hear the people sitting across from you. I ordered the BC salmon which came with some risotto and a roasted tomato. Everything was quite bland and I have definitely had better versions of the same food elsewhere.

Beautiful building, food, and a great location but poor service and bland food left me very unimpressed."}
{"text":"The food is good to very good, but so-so for vegetarians. I wouldn't hold that against a place though. It's French bistro style, so there is a great wine and cheese selection, and a good assortment of good beers.

My beef was with the service. It was a little scattered (forgot about items ordered), inattentive (courses taking longer than they really ought to), and then our server groused about her tip. Poor form! 

Make sure they give you separate tabs from the get-go if you need to pay separately, or else there may be attitude, and misunderstandings with insulting implications from the server.

For the flaky service, I consider them to be on probation for my continued business."}
{"text":"What can you say about Divino? My past experience has always been solid. My last visit 02/9th was superb with good food and great service. The server had an opinion which items might fit into what I was looking for in a lunch with my client.
I ordered lamb with fig ciabatta while guest had the BIG ribeye - yum. Mmmm...it was ALL good with the flavours melding into a great lunch to get one through the mid week ho-hum.
I have been here five times now and it is a repeatable experience - greatness is always happening here on the food. I have only had one questionable service experience - some servers believe they are solving hunger in the world (ego & arrogance) - just hit them on the gratuity line and they will learn you are willing to pay for only GREAT service.
Take a client here for lunch to impress or reward - you will not be disappointed!
This place is not upscale as in snobby...go! Do not get turned off by upscale label."}
{"text":"I had a really nice business lunch today. There were 2 of us at lunch.  We started off with an appetizer of the Tempura Haricort Vert; it comes with a honey hot mustard dipping sauce. My colleague ordered the Alberta Beef Tendorloin - she enjoyed it tremendously; served with green beans.  I had the Lobster Cannelloni with chantrelles and ricotta baked in a lobster bisque - so good!!  

We had to have dessert - she had the creme brulee and I had the hazelnut tart.  Really good desserts!!

The waiteress was very knowledgeable and could even describe the dish in detail!  

I haven't been to this restaurant for quite some time and the food is just as good it was the last time I went there.

Here's their website:  http://www.crmr.com/divino/index.php

{"text":"Delicious! I went to Divino and I was very impressed. The food, the decor and the service were all top notch.

I had the Lobster Cannelloni, and omigod it was so good. The pasta was fresh and light and fluffy, the lobster fresh and flavourful and the rest of the filling cheesy and delicious. The bisque it was served in was really delicious. Very yummy. My companions had a salad, chestnut stuffed ravioli and more lobster canneloni respectively, and they all raved too.

The service was great, from arrival to leaving. Our server was prompt and aware, always refilling glasses and asking if we needed anything without being intrusive.

The cuisine is all italian (obviously), with a ton of different pastas and some good looking meat dishes. The lunch prices were a little up there in price, but it was pure deliciousness. I had a decent little cappucino after dinner. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Divino for AGES and finally got around to it last weekend for date night. I was actually quite worried because it was snowing heavily and I know the area can be super tricky for parking. Luckily we got a spot right on 8th, but plan for extra time as we were still about 5 minutes late for our reservation.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were surprised at the size - it looks so small from the outside! The atmosphere was very warm, cozy, and intimate. Perfect date night spot! We were taken to our table at the back, which was unfortunately right under a cool air vent. Our server came around to take our drink order and ultimately, I was disappointed with her - I'm usually pretty upbeat and I like to engage the server in some banter, but she was very abrupt. I don't think she smiled once, and on more than one occasion, she walked away before we were even finished ordering or asking a question.

We started with a selection of cheeses, which were all very nice. However, I don't understand why they only give you like, 2 crackers, for 3 slabs of cheese. I had the Onion Soup for an appetizer - which was more cheese than soup - and Josh had the Buffalo Tartare, which was simply to die for. The Saltspring Island Chevre went SO perfectly with the meat, it was quite possibly the best tartare I've ever tasted! Our mains were absolutely delicious, but I would go back for the tartare alone.

Overall, the experience was really nice and the food was really good, but our service was so unremarkable that it didn't leave a lasting impression on me. It was very pricey, so I'm not sure I'd return for a full dinner - maybe just a glass of wine and some tartare!"}
{"text":"What a relaxing venue!  Even with an open kitchen you don't hear sounds of pots and pans clanking around in a feverish rush.  The wine selection is amazingly large and the cheese selection included well over 20 entries.  The atmosphere, food, and wines were very good.  Service was average, the only thing keeping this place from getting 5 stars.  Now don't misunderstand me!  I don't think the service was bad, but it wasn't as stellar as the menu.  The service was good, but the menu was great!  Such a place should have the service to match the menu."}
{"text":"Cute nothing unique more of a restaurant with wine than a wine bar. Somewhat misleading.

Charcuterie plate had off the shelf pates

Nice location nice ambience not a bad place not a wine bar"}
{"text":"My mom, sister and I went to dinner on a Saturday night at Divinio. We were celebrating a successful weekend of bridal shopping and this turned out to be the perfect place to celebrate. 

Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The food was spectacular. We started with the cheese board followed by mussels and fries (delicious) and then shared a tomato pasta entree that was the perfect portion and might have been the best of all three dishes. We finished by sharing the hazelnut chocolate torte.  All three of us loved our meal and total experience. We def will be back for more."}
{"text":"I've had both lunch and dinner here a few times. Love the gnocchi and have had all of the pastas from the menu- deelish!!!  Portions are not big or small. I shared the black pepper linguini and a hangar steak with a friend one night. Plus an appetizer. It was enough for us. 

Service is great and the staff are knowledgable about the menu ingredients. It's not a loud place so you can have a conversation at a comfortable volume w/o sounding like you went to \"da club\" for the night!!! Overall atmosphere is a dark wood, relaxed, classy adult feel, without being pretentious. I like that a lot 

This is a great place for date night, anniversaries and after work get togethers.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Divino feels classy but not entirely pretentious.  It's one of the great places to dine downtown prior to heading to a show, which is exactly what I did for the first time with some friends last month.  

I had the Chicken Cobb Salad and it was surprisingly flavorful and delicious.  I loved the dressing and it was plenty of food.  For once I didn't feel ripped off by the price of salad.  Our table shared the chef's selection of 5 cheeses and I don't care what anyone says, but this will always be too expensive.  One of the cheeses tasted like broccoli.  I definitely enjoyed the wine.

I don't have an issue with walking, but the distance to the restroom is slightly unfortunate.  And the stall doors are a little weird.  It's so far removed from the restaurant that it feels like a separate entity.

I think Divino is a great place for a dinner date.  The lighting is perfectly dim."}
{"text":"I've been to Divino a few times before (always on someone's expense account) and it's always been decent but never something amazing.  A date took me here last week after we couldn't get in at Murrietta's at 7pm on a Wednesday.  Apparently hump day is a real thing as everywhere was busy and couples seemed to be staying warm by drinking lots of booze and cuddling up.

Anyways, we wandered in, were seated right away, and were soon greeted by the real star of the date - our server Phil.  Seriously, I don't think I brought my \"A\" game of dating that night, but Phil brought his \"A\" game of serving.  If there was an Olympics of serving, Phil would sweep the podium.  

What makes him so good you ask?  He was awesome about reading the table, could tell that we didn't look at the menu for a while, was happy to answer questions, and provided recommendations on wine and food.  Oh, and we found out later, he was at the tail end of working a double - that's right, Phil was this awesome at the end of his workday.  

I know what you're thinking...\"Yeah, clearly you have a mini crush on Phil, but how was the food?\"  

Well, I went with Phil's reco and tried the lamb with parsnip puree, brussel sprouts, and potatoes.  I definitely didn't need to eat the whole plate but it was just so damn tasty and I didn't want to disappoint Phil. My date had the salmon and he seemed pretty happy with it, but it was no lamb.  I asked Phil to recommend some wine and he brought me a couple of options to sample so that I could pick the one I liked best.  My date actually really liked one of the options so he ordered that as well.

Bottom line -  It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time - the food and service were exceptional, and the company was pretty great too. I got a kiss at the end of the night but I was thinking about Phil the whole time....hehe :)"}
{"text":"I really liked this place... They have excellent pasta and if you want to eat healthy they have great options as well... Like the grilled fish it can be halibut or salmon.. Both are delicious... I have been there a few times and never disappointed.. Definitely a great place to go!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly overpriced for some very average food!! 

I read reviews before we went with a group of 10 and went with the highly reviewed muscles as an appetizer, they were great, but I should have quit there!  

I ordered the pepper linguine by recommendation of the waiter.......had two bits and sent it back!  He took 50% off of the entree off of the bill. The other friend that also ordered it only ate the chicken out of it and the waiter didnt even ask her if she was happy with it!!  Service 2/10  We had to refill our own water glasses a few times since the waiter was scarce between courses.

The wine list is huge and very extensive, but $$$$.

It might be an okay place to go and drop $200 on wine and cheese if that is your style, but I would just skip it all together!!"}
{"text":"I fully agree with Heather I. - but instead of Phil it was Jeff. Fantastic service from fun charming people. Food and wine was also delicious, and atmosphere was good. I'll be back."}
