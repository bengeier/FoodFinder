{"text":"I have to say that this food is great.  I honestly did not think that i was going to find a single thing on the menu that i would like since i am not a fan of onions or peppers but these guys (and girl) were awesome with accomodating me to the best of their ability.  They decided my best option was to go with the pulled pork with just a small amount of the beans and rice (so that i wouldn't spend all day picking out the onions).  They made it into a meal with a side, a desert and a drink for just 2 extra bucks (I love a great deal!) and after a short wait i was headed back to my office to try a whole new style of food.  As you can imagine, being my first time, i was excited and apprehensive all at the same time.  But having already spent my lunch $ on the bowl of food in front of me, i was left with little option but to dig in or go hungry.  I chose to dig in.  I can honestly say that i really liked the food- like A LOT!  i went from a skeptic to a believer within 3 bites of the pulled pork mixed in with the rice.  I also had never had a plantain before so when i tried the fried plaintains (without dressing- apparently there was either onions or peppers in it since they omitted it from my tray) i was all too  excited to find that they are delicious!  And the desert Churro was super yummy- the perfect sweetness to top off the meal.    Unfortuantely, although i truly enjoyed this entire meal (which shocked even me!),  i can only give it 4 stars since i just don't know that this could be a regular thing due to my food preferences.  however, what i had today was new and great and they definitely deserve at least 4 stars for getting me to try this new strangely yummy food!"}
{"text":"stopped in yesterday for a bite, i had the chillychanga, it was very filling and flavorful and it wasnt suspiciously quick coming out. tonight, i ordered a large cuban pizza, it arrived later than expected, bit the man delivering was very kind and not to mention, the pizza is soo goooood! the blend of spices and pulled pork are so tasty, i was addicted after my first bite! dont just be safe and order a plain cheese or pepperoni, order one of the specialties and let theae guys show you what they can do!"}
{"text":"Great/friendly service, but the veggie burrito is exceptionally bland with not much other than rice (some corn, beans, and a token amount of spinach).  Was hoping for something more flavorful.  Neither of us enjoyed it.  Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I had their cuban sandwich which was kinda flat and skimped out on the pork, but was nontheless tasty as all get out. their slogan has something to do with using all the spices in the world, and it definitely comes across right at the first bite.  i got a combo which included fritz and a ceenamon tweest i mean churro. the fritz... are not fries. they're closer to potato noodles fried and served with a drizzle of this delicious smokey sort of pepper chipotle sauce which if kicked up a notch or two could give Sriracha a run for its money. probably my favorite thing there.  the churro was delicious as well, a bit thick around, and filled with a custard, and had a ceenamon nutmeg sugar thing goin on that was mighty tasty.  i got all this (good proportions) and a bottle of water for under ten bucks, so out of all the food trucks i've been to, JiBARO handily wins for best value if they keep it up."}
{"text":"Yowza!  The flavors here are awesome.  Found Jibaro at Walnut Wednesday and decided the burrito was the way to go.  I ordered it with half jerk chicken and half pulled pork.  Inside you will find perfectly cooked yellow rice, bean stew, a few veggies and hot sauce.  Super flavorful,  and despite how crazy busy they were, we were greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Lots of variety in the menu and the portions are small so you can try 2 or 3 things easily. Prices are dirt cheap.  This food truck is worth going out of your way if you don't have plans for dinner. Gourmet it is not but if you're in the mood for a quick, cheap bite, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Went to the shop last night- got za to go, crisp, cheesy, and tasty.  I can't wait to return and check out the daily specials- monday bogo burrito, $2 taco tuesday. coolest thing- sit down pac mac & gallaga."}
{"text":"Pronounced \"HEE-borr-oh\" my Puerto Rican husband emphasized, proudly correcting me (as well as informing me that the word actually means \"hillbilly\" in Spanish).  This Food Truck serves delicious Caribbean/Latin cuisine - after nearly freezing to death at the first C-Town Chowdown, we excitedly devoured our (warm and comforting!) Spicy Seafood Bisque, Veggie Burrito Bowl, and side of Plantains in what seemed like seconds.  I can almost smell and taste the fresh cilantro now. . .SERIOUSLY good food.    Frequenting downtown and the near west side the most - see where they'll be next by following them on twitter: @JibaroWorldEats or friend-ing them on facebook."}
{"text":"I feel obligated to say that the 24-hour period following my Jibaro experience was very unpleasant. I tend to have an iron stomach and am able to eat everything under the sun. However, I had a severe case of the 'bubble guts' and found myself making frequent trips to the restroom, which did not make for the best Friday night out on the town.  I'm forced to dock a star because of this experience, but maybe I just got a bad egg. I'll still definitely try this place out again."}
{"text":"I had the caribbean rice and beans with pork. Truly crave worthy. My husband demolished 'The Beast' in about 10 minutes and would have willed his stomach into expanding enough to fit another.   The churros (not truck made) were warm, crunchy with cinnamon sugar on the outside and soft on the inside...mmm. They would go perfectly with a cup of french pressed dominican (or a dark roast) coffee. *nudge nudge* *hint hint*"}
{"text":"i've driven by this truck twice now, always wanting to stop but never having the time. So today, when I pulled by it, i reversed right away into a nearby parking spot and HAD to check it out!!  It was so delicious!  I ordered the Caribbean beans and rice w pork and plantains!  There was a delicious sweet salsa with it too! It was soooo good!  He offered me a combo which would've added churros, frites AND a water or gatorade for only $3 but I really wasn't that hungry..... maybe next time!  The food is great, the price is right! I'll be looking for JiBARO again!"}
{"text":"have you ever eaten something so delicious that it completely altered your day? thats what happened today when we went to jiBARO gourmet food truck. my mouth literally waters when i think about it. we went to Beats and Eats (highly recommend it, explained below). our plan was to try a couple of trucks, starting w/jiBARO. however, after our tastebuds were tantalized, we had to try more!! we started with the tropical jerk chicken combo - a fantastic flavorful yet slightly sweet taste- served with beans and 5-spice rice (omg) and a life-changing churro. we're never had anything like it. it was so fluffly and delicious encrusted with cinnamon sugar and filled with a delicious cream of some sort. and i normally dont really like filling - but this was phenomenal. we went back and got the garam masala shredded beef that was served on the beans and rice. wowza! it had the best flavor profile ever. a little zing, a little sweet, a little citrus, mmmm. it was a foodgasm for sure. the owner is so nice and i think its so cool how they can turn out such delicious gourmet food when they literally do everything on the truck from prep to cooking to serving. the world eats is a pretty accurate part of their name. they take their inspirations from all over. i dont know if anyone else could combine latin american and indian flavors into such a perfect marriage. bravo! i'll probably be back soon... like today...."}
{"text":"just say \"hee'-ba-roh\" spices from around the world chimmichurri rocks  Nice to see a food truck that expands culinary horizons.  All good with JiBARO.  Plantains, pineapple bread, pizza rolls, pinchos...  If you see this one, pull over.  Carry on..."}
{"text":"Latin flavors exploded here.  The portion sizes are good to amazing, the staff incredibly friendly the Caribbean pizza is to die for, and pizza by the slice bigger than your face.  The Cuban sandwich is a great interpretation as well.  The restaurant itself is cozy but brightly decorated and peppered with some classic arcade games.  The wait is good especially considering the pizza is traditionally baked not convection produced.    There are days I literally crave their food and they're an excellent alternative to Barroco (maybe better) which is often packed and getting expensive.  Overall a good value, amazing flavors, incredibly service and good to great portion sizes.  I'd only warn that the crust they use as a wrap and for the Caribbean pizza isn't a traditional crust. Be aware it's different."}
