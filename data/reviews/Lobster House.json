{"text":"The place is quite small for an Asian restaurant but provides quality traditional Chinese dishes for small - medium families at a good price. They recently changed owners and renovated the place but still kept some of the classics from the old menu (e.g the lobster steamed rice for 10.99 with a purchase of $30+)   Good to drop by with the fam when around the area for a classic casual dinner without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Thursday night. We got there at around 6.15pm and were the only table seated. Didn't have high hopes for the place, but it started to fill up a bit later on. Overall, the food is pretty good and sizes are really large. We ordered a fresh steamed eel with dried orange peel and black bean sauce. It was really good. We also ordered ginger sauce Chinese broccoli. Duck tongues with garlic stem and chicken livers with chillies. If you order over $30, you can order a lobster or quail steamed rice, for a special price of $8.88. We decided on the lobster rice.  Really surprised with the quality of the food but we ordered too much and had to pack 3 boxes to go. You get complimentary soup of the day and sweet dessert too. They were both just average. Everybody else's food looked good too. Overall, we had a good meal and service wasn't too bad either, for a Chinese place.  We will definately go back for dinner again because my children loved it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and lunch several times, the portions here are huge and the flavor and texture of food is on the good side. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Came in today for dinner (March 26, 2016); recommended by a YELP friend.  Cantonese fare with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here to try out for the first time with my husband. The dishes are big, however, the food are extremely salty and TONS OF MSG! My husband and I need to drink water every single time we took a bite of the food, no kidding!! I mean, we have also been to many Chinese restaurants and food courts, and i guarantee you cannot find anywhere that has more MSG than this place! will not go again"}
{"text":"Okay...never posted on yelp before but figured I would at least give a shout out for some good food.  Ate here once for a big family meal and just today I went out for a late night dinner with the wife as the place closes at 1 am.  This review is for the late night dinner we had.  This is an excellent family run restaurant.   Eventhough its name indicates specifically \"Lobster House\" its serves all types of your typical Cantonese style cuisine.   We ordered the following:  Crab with Fish Maw Soup: Honestly one of the best soups I've had with tons of fish maw, crab and even crab roe in it. 5/5  Ja Ja Chicken in Hot Pot: Chicken with Chinese sausage, onions mushroom etc. in a hot pot.  This was good but could have had a little more sauce:) 3.5/5  Beef Tenderloin Sizzling Plate Peking Style: Big thick portions of beef tenderloin.  Outstanding value. 5/5  Lobster Fried Rice in Bamboo Steamer: This was the special where if you order $30 or more it only costs $8.88!  A whole lobster (around 2lbs!) steamed in a bed of fried rice steamed with lotus leaf along with an egg white sauce!  This was an amazing value for $8.88! 5++ /5  The portions are all very large and generous.  Total costs for all that food was only $47! !  The service was very attentive and the staff was especially nice considering it is a Chinese restaurant.    Definitely a new go to place for quality and value!"}
{"text":"Sadly I did not have lobster here... Since lobster is not included in their lunch special aside from lobster congee or E-Fu noodle which cost $12.99, a little over my lunch budget.  Lunch Special available from 11 am - 5 pm everyday, with most of the items around $5.99-$6.99 that includes a drink.  When the waitress put my order of Fried Rice Noodle with Beef ($5.99) in front of me, I asked for a takeout container right away, as I know no way I going to finish that without having an upset stomach later...  Portion is huge. Like HUGE!!  The noodle was fried nicely with a smokey taste which I really enjoyed!  Now I have enough leftover for tomorrow lunch...   HK Milk Tea was really meh though. Maybe getting the Soup of the Day would be better?  The deco and layout is exactly the same as the previous restaurant in the same location. My table is a little bit sticky.. Dirty Cheap Chinese??"}
