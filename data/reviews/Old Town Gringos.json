{"text":"We came for the first time over the werkend for lunch. We like trying local places and new -to us- places. I can say we will not be back. The place was not busy, yet service was slow and horrible. With only a few things available on the menu you would think they would be mouthwatering tastbud exciting. But nope, flavorless. My husband got the burrito had to dump the bottled salsa they gave us for the chips  on it. I ordered the cheeseburger (I get this is a fake Mexican place) but don't serve me a dry tasteless overcooked burger.  And kraft ranch for my fries, yuck!. Guys a place this small deserves homemade, fresh, and culinary creativity.  The one star is for the chips they were good and the crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss, I had great service the first time I went, and the next time I felt like I was a bother. But i will say they serve pickle juice, which was something I couldn't find in many other bars."}
{"text":"We went there knowing it had changed owners and were a little worried. But that quickly changed the bartenders and servers were great. Very attentive.   We ordered street tacos and nachos. Both delicious.  We ended up going twice the week we were there. I will say we did miss the old queso dip.  Maybe someday they can put that back on the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to OTG to watch sports and listen to live music. A fun time. I'm on the older side but still feel like I fit in no problem. We always start off with margaritas then add the queso dip with green chili chicken, A MUST!!!  That dip is soooo delicious I'm full before my meal comes. Their salsa is awesome and tasty too. I had the carne asada street tacos which were good, but a tad tough (hence the 4 out of 5 stars), but will try them again, BUT I WILL ALWAYS GET THAT QUESO DIP!!"}
{"text":".went to watch the cardinals/packers game. Food and drinks were decent. The owner was very nice and came to check on us, but our server, Nicole, ruined our time by providing terrible service and a rude attitude. We ordered a few rounds of drinks from her and she would only bring out part of the orders. When we went up to the bar to get the rest of our orders she was standing there counting her tips. She spilled our beers and didn't say anything or even give napkins to clean it up. Every time we ordered she would look at us in disgust and finally said \"you know I'm not the only one you have to order drinks from\"."}
{"text":"Must check out this place.  Very welcoming and classy environment. Their carne asada tacos have a nice authentic taste, not greasy at all. They serve the best home made authentic salsa. Their burgers have a nice home char grilled taste from your back yard. Food is simply, delicious! Great bars to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Fun place to grab tacos and drinks while shopping. The carne asada and carnita tacos were awesome. Had a really good beer list and salsa and chips were really good."}
{"text":"I was not too impressed with this \"new\" establishment. I have been here many times when it was Dos Gringos and have much better customer service. I went there tonight and the bartender was pretty rude, I'm not sure if he was having a bad day or what, but it was definitely not an inviting environment for a guest. After my experience I will probably not go there again, considering there are bars on every corner that have way better customer service and an overall better/fun experience."}
{"text":"Good service. Sat down and server came to our table right away. Friendly. Not a ton of people here @ 10pm on a Saturday night but has a fun atmosphere. Upbeat music and fun games."}
{"text":"The place is definitely cleaner than when it was Dos Gringos but thats where it ends. Service was crazy slow ( not workers fault , not enough workers). Items ordered were made wrong. I always loved the burrito with the spicy sour cream sauce, gone. Menu is very limited.  I will try to go again out of hope, but not counting on it. 

Come on new owners, get it together !"}
{"text":"I always bring my out-of-town guests to Old Town Gringos because it has such a fun vibe! The staff is always friendly and accommodating, even when we bring visitors who have young children. The food is yummy but the drinks and the fun keep us coming back."}
{"text":"We've been to OTG several times and always had a great experience. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. I actually hosted a welcome party here for my out of town wedding and this place was the crowd pleaser! We used the OTG trolley for the evening and my guests had an amazing time on the second floor. Live music, good food, fun games, and great staff!"}
{"text":"Generic and lost its uniqueness. Very disappointing knowing how well it's predecessor. Do not go here"}
{"text":"One of the best margaritas in town!  But be careful they creep up on you!  This place still has a lot of the same charm as Dos Gringos, but I enjoyed checking out the remodel.  This is still a great day drinking spot with fun casual environment.  The food is pretty good and prices are low.  Our fajitas were solid and quesadilla looked pretty darn good too.  Safe to say, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Came in for a few drinks with friends before bar hopping elsewhere. Our bartender was amazing! I think his name Chris. Not only was he incredibly attractive but he made us all feel welcome and at home. We'll prbly get married but definitely check this spot out and ask for Chris, but don't flirt with him... That's my job"}
{"text":"new owners, great atmosphere, awesome food! you gotta try the chicken wrap, the sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a late night bite and of course margaritas! If you haven't been here in a long time come back and check it out. The whole place got a remodel. It reminds me of those TV shows when they redesign bars! lol

They have food and drink specials almost all the time (woohoo!) Their nachos are loaded, HUGE, and delicious.The tacos are great too. Now that I think about it I don't think I've had a bad item from here. They have a variety of drinks to choose from including the full bar. It has a cool vibe to come and relax at. My friends and I like to take a bar seat and people watch.

Ask for the chips and salsa! You won't be able to stop eating them!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Mexican food? What the what? I might go back for a drink, but the comida, never.  The blandness carries over to the customer service. Decent place....good for big groups. I got lemonade which was the most disgusting cup of who knows what I've ever tasted. The water was pretty decent. Just a typical bar scene in Scottsdale, but with no flavor. Sorry Old Town Gringos, that's about all it is."}
{"text":"I miss the old Dos Gringos.  Gone are the days of $3 street tacos and ushered in are $12+ plates.  The food wasn't bad by any means but it doesn't have the same charm as the old Gringos restaurant did.  I was pretty excited for the remodel but not so excited about their remodeled menu and overhauled prices.  My sister, mom, and I shared the buffalo wings and the carne asada tacos.  I will say this; the rice is fantastic, but the tacos are just ok.  The buffalo wings were way too spicy to be enjoyable, and this is coming from someone who LOVES spicy.  It was just too much.  Maybe happy hour would bring more reasonable prices but for now, I have no plans on coming back."}
{"text":"I wish I still had the time to go day drinking because I'm sure this would be a great spot to do that. The outside bar setup, games like Jenga, tire swing seats, and the overall atmosphere seems like it would be a great place to just hang out and relax.

Unfortunately, relaxed seems to be what this place does best and stopping in for lunch when you have to get back to work probably isn't the best move. First, it took a while to get noticed by the bartenders and that appeared to be a common feature among everyone I saw who entered after me. Then, after getting a menu and deciding what I wanted to order I again waited for the bartender to return. Once I placed my order I thought I would be fine. Unfortunately I waited nearly 40 minutes for a plate of tacos which just seems ridiculous. However, I was still optimistic that things would improve. I ate my lunch and placed my silverware and napkin on the plate in the universal sign that I am ready for a check. However, the bartender didn't notice and I finally had to flag her down when she looked over to see if the guys sitting around the side of the bar near me needed another drink. I finally paid and went on my way but it still took well over an hour to get a plate of tacos and an iced tea.

So to sum up, if you've got plenty of time and nowhere to be, this is the spot for you. Otherwise you may want to find a different place to go."}
{"text":"We dined in the outdoor patio which we really enjoyed with the perfect weather. Even played a game of Connect4. Jenga and beer pong also available to play. Tasty new menu. Had the mahi street taco which was especially and surprisingly spicy. Crowd ranged in age."}
{"text":"So far I have enjoyed this place for some adult fun and good drinks. But I'm going to ask the dumb question here, why are 3 children here running around playing ping pong and jenga at a 21+ place where even my father got carded to come into... I come here for the adult atmosphere and the lack of children. May reconsider my options in the future."}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight with Alex as our server. Food and drinks were phenomenal. And the staff was outstanding, and the manager made our experience even better. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone especially if you want to get a couple drinks and tacos with friends."}
{"text":"May 2017: The $3 Corona's are long gone, but replaced with the $3 Tecate cans. Menu was reprinted and looks nice, but basically the same food. Tuesday is $2 tacos, so that is good. 

The new menu's look pretty, but not customer or wallet friendly. The chicken burrito has soared to 11 bucks (with weird ingredients) and three small tacos with rice and beans are about the same price. There seems to be a disconnect between the clientele that shows up (mostly grubby) here and the menu prices. Anyway, stick to the free chips and salsa and $3 Corona's. 
       Also, every female bartender they hire is hot, but don't call me \"Honey\". If the roles were reversed and I yelled out, \"hey, Honey, can you get me a beer\" would she be offended?"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a comedy show and stumbled into this fantastic place.  After checking out several other places with over 2 hour waits we walked right in here and were seated immediately.  Our waiter was AMAZING and the food was by far restaurant style more than bar style although they had great bar food if you wanted that.  There were 5 of us and the wait time for drinks and food was brief. Our group had tacos, nachos, carne asada pita and the Sonoran dog.  The margaritas were strong and the best we've had in the area.  We sat inside but they also have an outdoor bar and dining area with misters that looked great.  Bathrooms were clean and we are already planning our next visit to this great place!!!"}
{"text":"No longer a Mexican restaurant. Now just a smoky outdoor sports bar with tacos on the sparse food menu. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good place to have a drink with friends. Place to smoke, pool tables, darts, etc... Friendly people good music and for the most part no stuck up individuals. Kind of hidden but worth the find."}
{"text":"Old Town Gringos was our second stop for the night. The bar has semi outdoor patio upstairs and downstairs, 3 bars and a small dance floor. They gave us a special on the beers beacause of the yelp check in!  We ordered egg rolls and quesadillas along with drinks here. 
Good food given the fact that it was bar food and the fact that it was about 1am when we ordered it. The waiters from the main bar were great (there were 3 awesome young guys that attended to us). We ate, danced, socialized with one another then got back on our party bus for our last stop of the night. 
It was my first time at Old Town Gringos and I will return."}
{"text":"Weak service. Food average lost its flavor need to regroup. Miss the old Dos day drinking."}
{"text":"WOW!  A complete new look in this location! We were very sad to say goodbye to Dos Gringos and their Taco Tuesdays, but what the new owners have done with this place is amazing. It proves that the place had some pretty \"good bones\". The renovations really kick the place up several notches, not quite \"Scottsdale Chic/Trend Spot\", but a very nice place. The kitchen is huge, and you can see inside. The menu is simple and has some classic bar grub, and a few items that make it a nice date night, including shrimp tacos. The shrimp was great and had a fresh and seasoned flavor. We also tried the Carne Asada tacos. The beef was flavorful and tender. I truly appreciate that they keep the \"heat\" down on the food and sauces so that you can actually taste the food. Our favorite bartender Barry (from the Dos Gringo's days) brought out a green and a red salsa for us to try. Both were flavorful. The red has a subtle smokey flavor that my daughter really enjoyed. The green salsa was fresh and has a citrus tang.  Being short has several challenges when sitting on bar stools, but these are as comfortable as they can get. The patio bar area has outlets under the counter all the way around so you can charge your phone/vape. New TV screens and sound system with good placement. The music was at the perfect level. You heard it, but you could carry on normal conversations. The patio is still dog friendly. As the new owners settle in and put the finishing touches on the place, it will be our \"go to\" for a night out. Also- a big shout out and kudos to the new owners for keeping staff, and offering the staff of Dos the opportunity to work on the remodel instead of just letting them go."}
{"text":"What can I say? The taco salad here is amazing! A dozen or so taps to pick from, a truly chill atmosphere with live music, but the main reason I come here is the service. I can go anywhere in Old town and be served great food and get any drink I want, but it's actually the service that makes me go to a few steps around the corner to old town gringos.
There's a couple really cool people that work here, but the one that stands out is definitely Brandy. It's service with knowledge and a smile as well as a spunky attitude. After dealing with tax law all day it's kind of nice to  laugh with somebody who can take your mind off that crap and explain with enthusiasm what's on the menu.
This place rocks, come in and get a Scottsdale blonde on tap and try the taco salad, but most importantly, ask for Brandy, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"When visiting from WI, we had a great time with Kase. Excellent bartender and the sole reason we'll be back to the OTG on our annual AZ trip next year. Definitely ask for Kase on your next visit. Love OTG!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful vibe in indoor/outdoor environment. Super great service and friendly crowd when we came from out of town for afternoon beer. Plus ladies: they raffle a $2500 Louis Vuitton bag every Thursday at 10"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned the renovation elevated this place from dive to respectable patio bar/restaurant.  This visit covers a Saturday afternoon, it was crowded but everyone who wanted a seat could find one.  Not the usual Scottsdale bar crowd, older and younger alike plus a few families with kids.  Live DJ spun the appropriate music for the crowd and kept it at a background noise level..much appreciated.   Staffing level was good, drinks were good, I had the Mexican pizza with chicken which had good flavor, jalapenos were a bit too spicy for my taste but easily removed, tortilla could have been crisper.  The food I observed at the other tables warrants future visits...place has been off my rotation for many years under the prior ownership but I see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food ... not the greatest atmosphere to eat in but ...... if you appreciate quality food and salsas it's really good"}
{"text":"Love the fun atmosphere here...the staff is amazing.. Especially Alex, our waiter soon to be new bartender. The Nacho Mamas are worth the trip to Old Town...the are seriously the best I ever had. Free chips and salsa, Beer is cold and games are fun...nice people and good music!"}
{"text":"They remodeled the old restaurant and gave it a little bit of a makeover without changing much of the layout.  The menu is very different though and I'm not sure if there's any food deal for happy hour.  They got rid of the Cheese dip that I loved to get here.  Just about everything on the menu is $10 with odd soups (tortilla, chili) and hot dog w/ fries being about $6.    

We opted for the Nachos with chicken, although some of the complimentary chips were very shiny with grease.  The salsas that came with them were pretty solid though.  I would've added some salt to one of them but there were no shakers at the table.

The nachos we ordered were pretty decent.  They had a tasty cheese sauce, oddly some grilled onions on it, along with the usual pico, guac, sour cream, etc.  There were also sliced jalapenos on it that was just toasted green but basically raw.  I'm not really a fan of that idea, it doesn't take much to pickle them~  Anyway, unless the chicken is also shredded I'm pretty sure our nachos had pulled pork on them instead of what we ordered.  It tasted decent, though we ordered chicken because we were sick of the 3 lbs of pulled pork we've been working on at home.

The service was pretty awesome.  You still walk in and just sit down which probably causes a lot of chaos for the staff trying to figure out who's being taken care of and such.  The bathrooms are nicer, but there are huge gaps in the women's stalls.  It's pretty, but there shouldn't be 2 inch gaps along the bits that make the stalls.  Seems like around the seams of the door and stall there was a 1 inch gap on either side of the metal, and in the corners there were the 2 inch gaps where the different sides of the stall meets.  I was in the corner stall near the door and I was surprised to be able to see the lady in the stall next to mine sitting on the toilet.  I shouldn't be able to tell if she's a squatter or a liner...  :P

The place is still a fun little place.  I wish they'd get a bit more variety on the menu.  Some shakers on the table and a drink menu might be nice.  It's still in a great location so I'm sure people will wander in."}
{"text":"Although I only stopped in for a drink and a light snack, I found the establishment inviting, adequately staffed and the appetizer to be of very good quality and quantity. 
The location is in the Old Town area of Scottsdale and off the Main Street. Finding it was not very challenging if you use GPS or the Yelp directions. It is surrounded by numerous bars and restaurants and to most people just blend into the environment. However, the place has a unique atmosphere and architecture that lends itself to various types of patrons. The bar area is comfortable and is a very casual area whereas there are other parts of this venue that allow for outdoor seating and open area tables. 
The staff were friendly, but, not overbearing and let us just enjoy our stay. We had a Guacamole and chip app that was not only tasty, but, generous in its portion. Prices were for the most part on the lower end for this tourist part of town. All in all a good value.  They had country music on Wednesday nights.  Might have to give that a try. Sorry I live far from this location or I would be a more frequent patron."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food and environment. No matter the time you're certain to have a great time. 
It's menu will entice you to try everything once you've enjoyed one entry. Festive mood, music and vibe. 
The bar tenders and servers are welcoming and provide a genuine feeling that you're truly welcomed and they're fun. 
Jim, the owner, is a perfect Host."}
{"text":"Food is great!

But the security guard (African American Male) working on 03/17/2016 st pattys day was a complete jerk. He was hear hustling into our conversations all night. He was trying to hit on one of my friends (female) ALL night and she was clearly NOT interested. The security guard later approached her during his shift and as they were talking her boyfriend approached him and asked him \"why are you hitting on my girl? She's with me.\" And then he got upset and kicked her boyfriend out of the bar very aggressively it caused a scene. You can NOT do that just cause you work there and you're the \"security guard.\" Some f**king bullsh*t!! Never coming back."}
{"text":"After flying in to Scottsdale for the weekend, my friends and I hit up Old Town Gringos to check out the Old Town scene. Yikes. I was pretty disappointed by how dead Old Town Gringos was at 11:30pm on Friday night especially when the pictures I've seen of this place online look very lively and fun. I can totally see the potential of this place though. It has multiple decks (I think the place goes up to 3 stories) that overlook the central bar and dance floors below. 

I ordered the Whiskey River cocktail, but unfortunately it was made terribly and was basically undrinkable. The bartender put in WAY too much syrup and bitters. I had to take baby sips, but the taste became unbearable to a point where I just gave up drinking it entirely. Mind you this drink was filled halfway in a whiskey glass. I probably should've asked for a different drink, but the drink deterred me enough to question the bartender's skills. I didn't think the food was any better than my drink either. My friend ordered a taco platter. I didn't try the tacos, but I had a fork full of beans and rice. Old Town Gringos apparently has a problem with excess in general. The beans were extremely salty."}
{"text":"Hummmmming along with my 'Summer Hummer-Old Town Gringos' style drink:  watermelon tequila, sweet & sour mix, lime per Ian. Cool bartender, Ian, gave great recommends for drinks & food.  Also made great skinny margarita which is less sweet. Rick was great too. 

Blackened shrimp tacos w/rice (it's white rice with corn -FYI cause it's unexpected) & beans: remoulade sauce, avocado slices, queso fresco & cilantro was delicious. 

The whole atmosphere is very chill, laid back with wide range of ages & backgrounds who just want to enjoy the friendly staff, food & music. 

Their recent remodel looks fabulous & fun!  Downstairs looks more casual & rustic with games to play: huge block Jenga-type game, Mega 4 in Line (similar to Connect 4), ping pong table & etc. with multiple bars/seating type areas to choose from.  Upstairs was gorgeous & more cozy 'cabana' upscale with a great view of Old Town Scottsdale with its own bar.  Previously known as Dos Gringos but don't compare because different owner therefore name change. 

Previous time there: all the servers & bartenders are awesome; especially, Ryan & Kaula was awesomely sweet, friendly & beyond caring. They let me borrow a charger for my IPhone (FYI:  they have outlets at the bar seating areas where they have the purse hooks under the countertops) & even made sure I got home safe.

Soooo friendly from staff to their customers.  It is a great experience and will definitely come back & refer.

PS Thursday night is ladies night with late night raffle drawing of designer woman's purse.

Also great for large groups of 150+: service, food & drinks flowed easily with lots of fun without any hiccups (know personally)."}
{"text":"I was seeking a sports bar to watch the football game on Sunday and OTG showed up as an option on Yelp. Well big screen TVs, crowded but not jammed, and very attentive service equals 4 stars any day of the week. There is a nice patio area for you sun seekers but I was more concerned with finding a good viewing spot. 

I did have their Philly cheese steak slider as a nod to the Eagles and they were a fine accompaniment to my pint. I loved that they had the game broadcast blasting through their sound system and played music during the, endless, commercial breaks. Even though I ordered the Philly sliders I was there to root my Pats to victory and even though the bar was 90% anti Patriots I had a great time. Hmmm maybe a return trip on SB Sunday is in order."}
{"text":"Came here for food pretty late, the pork sandwich is SO GOOD and zesty. Chris is such a friendly bartender! Thanks for the suggestions!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink!  Loved that you could actually talk to each other without yelling. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pre-gaming before a concert down the street. 
Sat in the INSIDE bar out of the sun. It looks like they've revamped it a little bit.
Nice inside bar, good beer selection (I'm a sucker for goose island)
Had the chicken fajita's which were awesome and the presentation was great.
Bartenders were great too!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to provide a more granular rating, because there were a couple of things that impacted how I felt about my last two visits there...

The Renovation/Atmosphere: 4 Stars
The previous incarnation of OT Gringos, Dos Gringos, was known for being a dive. The place was kind of a mess, but the food was good. I often wondered how it stayed in business because it was so empty most of the time. The renovation is undeniably better, and certainly has attracted a larger crowd. Instead of feeling divey, it feels clean and nicer, with a better vibe. (Maybe because I can convince people to go here now?) The live music was a great addition!

The service: 2 Stars
Last time we were there (for the Cardinals/Green Bay game), we sat in the indoor area with a group of 10 people. The place was PACKED and management definitely hadn't prepared for that kind of crowd. Maybe this is a symptom of working out the kinks, as they figure out their new demand, but there definitely should've been a few more servers working the indoor area. The bartender who also waited on us had dark curly hair and an AWFUL attitude. People at other tables were commenting on it too - she refused to split our check, never brought out our food (we had to go to the bar and ask for it from another bartender. I could see three shelves full of food that wasn't getting delivered to tables), and generally was nasty to us when we were ordering drinks. I get being busy, and I've been a server myself. It's frustrating. But part of your job is providing good customer service, and we didn't get that at all. Better staffing and training is definitely needed.

The food/drinks: 3 stars
I'm a nacho-lover, and my chicken nachos would have been 4-5 star if they'd been hot. After a long wait, I went up to the bar and asked for them. They were great, but cold because they'd been sitting. Sort of disappointing, but I think the quality would've been decent if they'd made it to the table while hot. Drinks weren't bad, but we had a really hard time getting refills.

All in all, OT Gringos is having some growing pains. We'll certainly be back to give them another try once they've had a chance to get some of this stuff resolved. The potential is there, and I think it could be a pretty good place to start a night or hang out for a game. I'll be interested to see how it's doing in a few more weeks."}
{"text":"Went to Old Town during a bar crawl event that my boyfriend and I were not apart of. Gringos was serving everyone, regardless of if they had an event wrist band or not. I got in just fine but the event bouncer wouldn't let my boyfriend in. He proceeded to ask him questions like where he worked and if he even had money to order anything. My boyfriend is black, I'm white, as soon as I saw this happening I intervened and he was finally let in. We then tried to order drinks at the bar. We could not get service and kept getting overlooked by the bartenders. It was 2pm on a Saturday, it wasn't busy, no reason why my boyfriend's drink order should be neglected. I'm absolutely disgusted with this place and we will NEVER go back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Can't beat the laid back atmosphere and the fresh food. We stopped by while on vaca for a quick drink before we went to Whiskey Row and didn't even end up leaving! Ended up playing beer pong, listening to live music and drinking all night. I was scared to see the bill but it was only like $170 for 3 of us. Such a pleasant surprise we left a $60 tip. Our waitress was awesome. A real feel good joint if you want a break from the other clubs, to pregame before them or stop by after since they serve delicious food until 2 am. One word. TACOOOOOS!"}
{"text":"I know this is technically an \"outdoor\" bar, but wow no designated areas for smokers?? So I'm subject to second hand smoke while I eat & try to watch tv? I didn't see any Cancer Free tables? Unfortunate because this is a cool spot BUT I won't be back :/"}
{"text":"People smoking in my place is never great, but Brittany our bartender made our visit worth while. Good place to hangout outside if u don't mind the smoke. Prices are ok."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour on taco Tuesday with a group of friends.  All I really have to say is that this place blows.  The service, along with the food is subpar.  The waiter never wrote down our orders so of course when the food arrived it wasn't correct. The house margaritas were served in a glass equivalent to the size of a Dixie cup and was pure margarita mix, no tequila. The shrimp taco was awful, I guess you get what you pay for. I'm glad it was happy hour pricing otherwise I would have been more upset for paying full price. I'm sad to say that my high school picked this place for our 10 year reunion in October. I definitely will not be purchasing anything during that time I will be attending."}
{"text":"The bartender Kevin is absolutely the best bartender I have ever experienced! Definitely ask for him!!! They have corn hole and a lot of other fun games to play plus room to dance! Bathrooms were also completely stocked and super clean!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, the shrimp tacos are amazing and they have my favorite beer, Papago Orange Blossom on tap. The fresh chips and salsa are a nice addition."}
{"text":"Extremely unfriendly male bartender , wearing sunglasses behind the bar, flat hat, and earrings. Had the inability of a simple 'thank you' or the remote ability to believe we were customers. Huge chip on his shoulders. Never again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Ordered water that taste gross. Adding lime or lemon made it taste even more gross. 
Also ordered shrimp cocktail and quesadillas. 

Shrimp cocktail had a very few tiny pieces of what appeared to be frozen and thawed grocery store shrimp with no taste. The shrimp looked mashed. The cocktail sauce was too sweet with no other flavors. 

Chips were cold, no salt, no taste and really nothing to talk about except for the fact that they weren't awful. 

The quesadilla was the worst quesadilla I've ever tasted. It tasted like someone soaked the tortilla in butter then heated it up. The entire thing was horrible and you could taste the oil from the pan or the cheese or whatever. But all you taste was oil or butter. 

The price for these 2 lunch plates came to just over $24. That's too expensive for the quality. 

We will not be back to eat. 

I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 simply because it was clean, very nice atmosphere, and I'd come back to have drinks outside but NEVER to eat."}
{"text":"Cool spot for feeding the inner animal and drinking up some libations to some live music!

Cool bar to hang out and pass some hours!

The PR girl was super cool!

All the staff was great!

Thanks for throwing a party for us to hang at!

Stop in for a drink!"}
{"text":"This place had a lot of potential. I used keep it on my go to list to bring people for good atmosphere and a fun time. But now, it seems like every time I'm here they are \"under new management\" or \"changing their menu\". Lots of excuses for mediocre service and not so great food. I was here most recently with a group of friends trying to have a few drinks as grab a quick bite. It took over an hour for our food to arrive. The order was wrong. They gave us a plate of tacos that \"nobody else had ordered so we're welcome to them\". Totally killed our vibe for the whole night.  I like it better back in the old days when they were a dive bar, not trying to pretending to be an Old Town hot spot. Maybe better to just go for the booze. Definitely not missing anything, there are plenty of other places to go."}
{"text":"Yummmm!!! The totchos were delicious and the staff was so friendly. I liked how easy going the atmosphere is. I will  definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can be a fun place but watch your tabs.  It was Cinco de Mayo and they tried not to honor happy hour pricing despite no one saying otherwise and them having the specials listed all over the bar.  That's a bit shady, but what's really bad was the chunky female bartender with the wavy brown hair's 'fuck you' attitude when it was brought to her attention.  Not, \"how can I make this right?\", but \"we've been looking forward to this holiday since last year and we're not doing happy hour\", and then turning and walking away.  Eventually someone got it fixed but the fluffy bartender chick could have fixed it without the rudeness and they would have still gotten a nice tip.  Shitty tip for a shitty, unnecessary attitude.  Just look over your tab carefully if you go here."}
{"text":"Cool place to go to if you want good Mexican food. The burrito (ground beef, cheese, refried beans, rice) was pretty good but the cheese sauce that topped it was delicious. The three taco platter (shrimp, carnitas, carne asada) was tasty as well, but the carne asada was the best. Had a nice outdoor patio with lots of tvs, misters, and games to play outside. Perfect place to go to watch Sunday football or enjoy happy hour."}
{"text":"The place was clean and so were the bathrooms.  Our server \"Nicole\" was very attentive and friendly.  
Our tacos were cold and so was rice and beans.  We expected better food for the price."}
{"text":"I would like to point out that management did reach out to me to apologize, which is very professional.  I'd also like to mention again that this was just one negative experience.  Every other time I've gone to OTG I've had a great time.  They always have good service and good food."}
{"text":"Fun place to chill! This place has huge size games to play such as checkers and jenga. Way cool when hanging here on a Saturday afternoon. There is plenty of space to hang out and not feel squashed. There are plenty of bar locations within the bar to choose from so you are not having to wait forever just to get a drink. I have eaten here as well and the food was okay. I would recommend that you come here more to mingle and have fun. There are plenty of tv's to catch the games plus you have the option of sitting inside or outside. This place has certainly upgraded from how it was years ago."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to OTG. I am new to Arizona in the last 8 months ...I went when the bar was dos gringos. I am guessing that place has history.  But it was rundown. I wasn't a big fan.   Now with new ownership and design I enjoy coming much more.  The bar staff and owners are all very friendly. case in point.   LADIEEESSS....Thursday nights they raffle a free handbag...YES.. FREE!!..name brand....leather...you get the point. Its a GENIUS idea to get patrons to come IN...anywayyy I WON!!!! and I have the worst luck. It was really cool..two of the owners came up and congratulated me as well as the staff.  I can't hate a place that upped my handbag game. I enjoy the food as well, I love the rice that comes with the tacos and the green salsa mmmmm. Simple fare to fill your tummy while enjoying libations.  I am patiently waiting for desert to be on the menu.  soooo  I look forward to hanging out at OTG more often.  Definitely my neighborhood joint!! And  now that I won the raffle....I can tell more ladies about the thursday night drawing and not be in fear of lessening my chances. 
. j/k kinda sorta."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because of a recommendation and absolutely love this place. We ordered the taco platter and got the chicken, steak and barbacoa and they were all amazing. The margaritas were pretty decent and they had a good beer list. My favorite part though was the outside eating along with the great staff.  Highly recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Decent bar food. Not great, not terrible. Serv ice was fast and a fun atmosphere. Would go again for drinks bit might opt for somewhere else to eat. But not bad."}
{"text":"We had never heard of this place until we went to a spring training game and they offered a free margarita with your ticket stub. My husband and I decided to stop in since it was a very hot day and were in need of a nice refreshing margarita.

You wouldn't think it from the outside but it's quite roomy in there with an indoor/outdoor type atmosphere.  They have several bars and also have many lawn games to be played which was entertaining. 

We both got a margarita which was ok, it was your typical house margarita.  Then we decided to split the nacho appetizer which was huge and quite tasty. I always enjoy when queso is used instead of shredded cheese so that was a bonus. They also had a decent selection of craft beers on tap which was a pleasant surprise.

The service was a bit slow for the amount of patrons in there since it wasn't that busy but all of the staff seemed pretty friendly so it wasn't a turn off.  All in all it was a great little gem that is kind of tucked away and we would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Great service, fun games for customers to play, great music!! Not to mention food and drinks are on point!! Love his place and it's a must see for anyone visiting old town scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fun bar in old town, lively bar tenders put on a show.   Games on the 1st floor include beer pong, jumbo jenga, corn hole.  Lots of local service workers come here after their wait shifts."}
{"text":"Came on a very slow night, it gave me a college frat party atmosphere type, (duh being so close to them) place seems like it could be lots of fun came in for a few drinks the bartender was nice and friendly, I would return."}
{"text":"Best 80s music. Nice. Cool. Fun yard games. Cold beer. I alway come here when in town. You should too"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for some drinks/late night eats after successfully escaping a room at Escape the Room AZ down the street. I never actually went to the old Dos Gringos, but I can say that they did a good job with the remodel. The food was alright and the craft beer selection was pretty sorely lacking in my opinion however the Orange Blossom I ordered was the bomb so I'll give them that. They also had live music which I'm sure would be a nice touch had we arrived earlier (they were already getting ready to go as it was pretty late). 

I'm holding out and giving this place 4 stars on the potential from what I saw, but I need to come back earlier in the night on a Friday/Saturday for a full assessment."}
{"text":"Chris rocks that's for making a rough week that much better. Food till 2 can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Gringos is always a great place to grab some quick and good food. Since I was in for lunch, I didn't grab any alcohol...."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance, after all everyone deserves a second chance, plus the nacho papa's are good.  This time the experience was much better.  Our waitress was Alyssa and she was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"So sad cause I so wanted to have fun Saturday. We all decided to try the new spot in Old Town before meeting our friends for dinner at Eddie's House. Well NOT a good idea. Sad but we will not be back EVER. Too many great spots in Scottsdale and terrible terrible terrible service"}
{"text":"Fun place, good drinks. Food is ok, good for bar food, but definitely a place to visit to have a good time. Bartenders are awesome and very attentive. Fun place to visit on a date night or just out with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place Kris and Lowe are awesome! Since moving for NYC it's hard to find a cool chill vibe these 2 guys are my favorite in old town!!! Love them"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  All the way from the multi level ratios to the food and drinks. The staff is cool as well as the owner. My wife and I Come here for happy hour during the week which offers great specials."}
{"text":"Wandering around town on a Saturday we happened into OTG. The had a nice variety of beers on tap so I was very happy. Our server was ok, but not the most professional. When I asked about a certain beer, I might have expected her to say something like, \"It's very popular (or not...), would you like to try a taste?\" and not, \"I don't know, I've never had it.\"

I ordered the taco salad and my husband had the bbq pork sandwich. My salad was great, would have been even better if they'd actually put the dressing on it, as advertised. I eventually asked for some and it was really good. My husband enjoyed his sandwich as well. 

Our expectations were fairly low as this place clearly caters to a younger crowd and we are old, but other than the (always) too loud music, we had a good time."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was in town visiting my childhood best friend and her husband. The waitress we had was cool. Very bubbly and fun. The food was delicious and so were the drinks. Will come here again in the future! A+"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Went here with friends for veterans day lunch. This place is a little noisy but definatly will be back here. This place is a great place for a group meet up."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times for Monday's trivia night hosted by the always excellent Trivia Time, and have enjoyed expedient service (s/o to the never-ending chips & salsa (both the green and red are delicious though pretty mild)) and a vibrant patio atmosphere. Both beer & ping pong tables, large Jenga and Connect 4 games, and corn hole/bags are spaced around. Though I've never been to its past life as Dos Gringos, Old Town Gringos is well kept and worth making a regular spot.

Order the tater tot nachos. I don't think I need to say anymore."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , food and fun!!! Check it out.... Play some games and have some fab food.....plenty of tvs for sports!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and this place does not disappoint. Great food, good drinks, and awesome music!!! I would kill to have one of these in Utah!"}
{"text":"This place used to be Dos Gringos and it was awesome. They closed down for a remodel, opened back up as Old Town Gringos, and became awful. The price of food and drinks has nearly doubled, while the quality has decreased considerably. The interior used to be unique and cool, now it's cliche and boring, just like every other Old Town Scottsdale formula bar and restaurant. The service and staff are among the worst in Old Town. Don't visit this place. Dos Gringos is dead, and this retched zombie that replaced it is a nightmare.

EDIT: In case it isn't obviously clear to anyone, most of the 5 star reviews for this place are obvious fakes. Scroll past them to find the real reviews."}
{"text":"First time here, great food and extremely friendly staff.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really upset. My one night off and all I wanted was some tacos and it just turned out crappy! I got there and it took almost 8min for anyone to acknowledge me, than I ordered and told them to write it down-(they didn't) and of course 2 out of the 4 tacos were wrong. Also they must have changed the menu because it's completely diff from the last time I was there and I was looking forward to what I had previously! I than asked for sides (cheese and sour cream)and of course never ever received them. I even finished my drink and no one asked me if I wanted another. Than when I wanted to close out, it took me almost 15 min to get someone's attention to do so, and when I got the bill- it was of COURSE wrong. Not one server had a smile besides when they joked with the blonde behind the bar. Everyone looked miserable there- no wonder there were only 10 people in the restaurant on taco Tuesday! This was my ONLY night out this week and I was so looking forward to it! We've been in once before and the manager was SUPER sweet but today, no sign of a manager and no sign of happy, knowledgeable staff! Never going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, especially Carly. She's always in a cheery mood and makes a mean Deep Eddy Ruby Red Grapefruit Moscow Mule. The bar itself is expansive and they have just updated their menu to include a more Americanized fare. They've also had live music pretty much every time I've been here. Oh, and giant Jenga!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible from start to finish. We walk in and it's dead. On a Thursday evening. We were so excited to come check this place out too. We sit down at the main bar which was the only bar serving anything. We literally sat for 15/20 minutes and waiting for somebody to acknowledge our existence. Then dude comes over and we order a drink. Dude is missing most of the time. Garbage. My friend and I were so excited to come and check it out, play jenga and maybe eat some food. So we ask for a menu. Took him forever to grab us some. There was nothing appealing on the menu at all. By this time we were finished with our first drink. We're literally trying to order another drink. The guy was on the other side of the bar ignoring us. Like what are you racist? My friend is white and I'm Latina. I wouldn't be surprised. It was then my friend and I decided that we need to bounce from this lame ass place and we didn't want to spend another dime  here. Literally we couldn't find the dude again to close out and this other female bartender was talking to this one dude flirting and NOT tending to the bar. We sat there waiting another 15 minutes. My friend and I had it and went to interrupt the chicks flirty conversation. We asked her if she could stop flirting for a second to close us out. Right as that happened the dude appeared back! What?! Someone decided to work? Boy was I wrong. He was closing us out and gave us our bill before charging us thank god! Dude tried to overcharge us! He added three shots to our bill! Like wth are you high?!?!? Probably! We were NOT happy. It's like what in your right mind decided to charge us for drinks we did NOT drink?! He like pussied out like the bitch that he is and ran off and made the chick fix it for us. No apologies, nothing for HIS mistake! Garbage. The chick was nice and fixed it for us. We thanked her because she fixed the mess that the bitch boy made. I will NOT recommend going here and when I visit I will avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Old Town Gringos in Scottsdale has the best fajitas in town and ice cold beers. Today they offered buy one entree get one free, what a deal. Service is great and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Otg is a fantastic place for football fans and everyone alike. Had a bartender named Lowe, was on point, quick and easy to order and talk to. For sure coming back!"}
{"text":"The slowest service ever.
Bartenders are slow.  
Food service is abusrdly the worst.
The whole place is on snail time. If you are gonna die in the next couple days, avoid this place.  You will see God before you see your food.   This place is horribly bad at customer service. 
Waitress is cute with her tattoos but it doesnt help with the slow ass drink and food service."}
{"text":"I love the remodel, and I used to be a HUGE Dos Gringos fan. I haven't been here on a weekend night but I came here with a couple of friends yesterday for drinks and appetizers. Drinks were good and our bartender was friendly. I ordered a second drink and at one point the other male bartender brought me a cup with lemons because he \"heard I liked lemons\"  Chips and guacamole were delicious. The new decor is really nice and the bathrooms were SUPER nice. Especially compared to what they used to look like. I will totally come back here."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon and Went on taco Tuesday and the tacos were well worth the 2$. Delicious. Tecate was on special but they had already run out and we were there fairly early in the evening. They had a band playing which was good dining entertainment.  Cool place to hang out in an outdoor type of bar. Beware though, there are no designated smoking areas."}
{"text":"Margaritas are weak and runny, girls are a little bit funny. But that's how I like it."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friend's to have cocktails and a bite to eat . The staff is excellent"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Went there for brunch on a Sunday morning.  The waiter brought our beer in a dirty glass.....I mean you can see the lipstick remains from what I am assuming was the night before--GROSS
Had the biscuits and gravy sliders with bacon but the gravy was cold, came with fries and those were good.  My husband ordered the burrito and he was satisfied."}
{"text":"Robert has been amazing!!!! He served me all night and my group of 15. He didn't get anything wrong and on top of having a full bar, he checked in on us every 15 minutes. Great place with amazing food!!! Thank you Robert for such a great experience."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, they have recently spruced up the place a little bit. It's mainly a bar but I do believe some bar food is available there. The drinks are good, bartender flips the glasses and bottles for your entertainment. Nice touch... They have a TV's for sports viewing and one very, very large TV for watching the main sport game of the day. Jinga and corn hole games are also provided for your enjoyment. The music can be quite loud, but doesn't really bother me unless you are talking to someone."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since it was Dos. It was pretty slow last night and I didn't really explore the whole place but the place seemed very clean and the menu was great. We had the totchos with Carnitas which were fan...freakin...tastic. Everybody else had a chicago dog and loved them. We had a great time and things were reasonably priced. Robert was our bartender/server  and he is, hands down, a total asset to this place! Great, great service. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Rode bikes here and was looking forward to a nice patio bar (which it is!) BUT our server wasn't well groomed whatsoever, which made me leary of ordering food. (dirt under all the fingernails is a complete turn-off) What is management thinking when hiring someone for a serving job? Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Boo! Poor service. Limited beer. Bad food. I sat at the bar as the invisible man. Bunch dumb kids catering to thier buddies... only"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING FOOD!!! OMG! The renovations look amazing! This used to be Dos Gringos. We indulged in the guacamole and chips as a quick appetizer. The guacamole was on point! Then I ordered the Fajita Salad. Really good with ample amount for serving size. The spinach salad was fresh and delicious also. Dessert: apple pie à la mode! So good! You MUST see the upgraded restaurant. Great DJ! Lots of fun. :-) YAS!!!!!!"}
