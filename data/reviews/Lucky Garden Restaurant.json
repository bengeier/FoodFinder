{"text":"I've tried many dishes here. The chicken fried rice is great and the price is right, but everything else is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Well if your type of restaurant includes a \"office\" type area (if that's what you want to call it) in the dining area. Then look no more this is your place. Lets not forget the terrible food.. you're better off throwing your money into the trash can. Either way that is where it is heading."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from here once but I can easily say that I wasn't that impressed. The food was quite soggy and bland and was difficult and confusing to order over the phone."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting food! Customer service was atrocious and the staff pretty much said go fuck my self when they messed up my entire order. I would never recommend this place the food was honestly so gross"}
{"text":"Great little Chinese food place for when you get a craving. Had the Cantonese chow mein and it was huge and overly filling. There's no way one person can eat it all!! The lady there is nice."}
{"text":"I have eaten really bad food but this place is the absolute WORST food I have eaten in my life. I love Chinese food, and now I am second guessing ever eating it again.the honey garlic spare ribs are disgusting I wouldn't even feed them to my worst enemy. The Szechuan chow mein is gross, and the spring rolls r grease shrines. Don't take the chance with this place, you will throw everything out like I did."}
{"text":"I honestly thought I could be one of the scarce two-star reviews, but I was wrong. Came here an hour before closing (11pm) and the door was locked. The owner reluctantly came over and asked us what we wanted. After explictly stating we wanted BBQ pork + white rice, we were charged for BBQ pork and PORK fried rice ($4 more). Despite rejecting the claim, the owner continued to insist we wanted pork fried rice, so we got it.   The BBQ pork was drier than the desert. Never in my life have I had a full Chinese dish I couldn't eat, but this was repulsive. Similarly, the pork in the pork fried rice was awful.   Their hot sauce was good. If you have ANY choice (even if you're drunk) please do not eat here."}
{"text":"Went here once for lunch, terrible food I've ever tasted!! I had to wait 10 minutes for a lunch combo and the place was totally empty..the dining area smelled like moth balls.. I'm never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Great wonton soup Crazy cheap with huge chucks of chicken too And they were very fast  Don't know why there's bad reviews, haven't tried anything else there yet Will update soon"}
