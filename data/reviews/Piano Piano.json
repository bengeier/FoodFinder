{"text":"Terrible service and food was underwhelming.   Being a new mom and wanting to rejoin the living world and the life I lived prior to my son, I was super excited to hear about Piano Piano and their new family-friendly concept. I made reservations online and was even more excited to see there was a promotion for a free kids meal until June 30th. We went with another couple who also has a baby girl and both families left pretty frustrated.   The night began with us being told that we would not be able to go to the kid's room because it was fully booked. This was annoying because no where on their website does it mention to call if you want to book for the kid's room. Apparently the online system automatically books you for upstairs. Fine...I can get pass that, BUT more than 2 waiters told us that it was okay to be seated downstairs and/or they would try to move us downstairs. Maybe we just happened to get a bad waiter, but our waiter said we couldn't sit downstairs. And so we stayed upstairs.  The next issue came when I asked if the special promotion would still apply. Apparently it doesn't apply because we're upstairs. That makes absolutely no sense to me because we were within the time frame in the same restaurant. I asked my waiter a few times and he said it wouldn't apply. Fine...we'll live with it and just pay the $12 for his meal. No biggie.  Then the food came...our son's meal was overcooked, over-salted and under portioned. We ordered the meatballs (which were dry and even made him cry at one point when he bit into it because it was so hard), the broccoli bites (which only had 1 real piece of broccoli and lots of little scraps), and the chicken bites. I loved the concept of a healthy meal on a super cute ezpz mat for my son, but Piano Piano didn't even come close to delivering. Our food was pretty terrible too. We ordered an appetizer portion of one of the pastas which was really salty and REALLY tiny and we ordered a pizza. The Fun Guy pizza tasted pretty good except the arugula felt really gritty. I'm pretty sure arugula isn't normally gritty so my husband mentioned it to the waiter who just made excuses for the kitchen. He told us he's pretty sure they washed it and would let them know. We never heard back from him about the issue. Our friends ordered the Bitter pizza. Despite its' name, it was pretty good. Finished off our meal with 2 desserts the chia pudding from the kid's menu and the nutella tiramisu. Both were underwhelming. The chia pudding felt super healthy so that's a bonus. The nutella tiramisu was missing nutella and was super small.  After our meal, my friend and I decided to take our babies downstairs to check out the room. There was a HUGE empty table downstairs that was free....  Maybe we just had a terrible server. Not once did he say hi or smile at our children which I guess is not expected, but it would be normal to acknowledge all of your customers. And on more than one occasion he took plates away when there was still food on them. He did put our friend's stroller away for them which was the one nice thing he did....  Needless to say, the family-friendly concept that the chef was going for didn't work for our 2 families. Again, maybe we had a terrible server who may have ruined it, but our families definitely won't be returning to find out if it was just a one-off. I had such high hopes too, but I think we have received better service and our children have been treated better at other middle to high-end restaurants that weren't even made to be family-friendly."}
{"text":"Best meal of the year! Piano piano was fantastic from start to finish. Overall, staff was very friendly and knowledgable, restaurant was well lit and not too loud. The food is rich and full of flavour. Burrata was exceptional, the smokey bear pizza was delicious- the dough is like biting into a cloud. The carbonara was the most flavourful I've ever had. Will definitely be back here and recommend to anyone looking for a great Italian dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Piano Piano. The decor is fun and fresh; definitely more casual than it's former tenant. I think the concept is fantastic including the lower level family/kid friendly space (although we did not dine here).  The server was knowledgeable and upbeat; and proved helpful throughout the evening. We has garlic bread, and also one of their chopped salads to start which was creative, tasty and combined a lot of different flavours that I didn't expect. Both my guest and I had pasta dishes (unfortunately I can't recall exactly what they were), but both were delicious and decent serving sizes. We stayed a few hours enjoying some delicious wine (which are decently priced with options at different price points), food and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I would never return to this restaurant after the horrible experience last night. Dined here with a group of 10. The service we experienced was absolutely appalling - our waiter was rude and made us all feel unwelcome in the restaurant, not to mention the fact that he was awful as a server (packed up our leftovers after putting dirty cutlery on top of them). I spoke to the manager after the meal to let him know about the service we had experienced and he was extremely rude and condescending and made no effort to apologize or rectify the situation.   On top of this, our food was mediocre AT BEST. We tried several of the dishes because of the large size of the party and were unimpressed by all of them. Would not recommend this place to anyone.  Go to rasa down the street instead and ask for Laura - both the food and drinks are 100x better!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love to go out in Toronto's chic restaurants where what you see and hear sets the stage for what you eat. But when what you eat falls so short of the ambience, as it does at PP, then your night is a bust. I walked into PP not expecting anything (a friend had suggested the venue and made the reservation). I walked out disappointed to have left any of my hard-earned money in the place.   The good: yes it's a really nicely decorated restaurant. Both the upstairs PP and the downstairs piccolo piano. Each with its own twist on the black white and hot pink theme, wild wallpaper covering the walls     The bad: the food was so so blah. We had chopped salads that were schizophrenic (kale and polenta and fried chickpeas and feta and pickled onions and fried Brussel sprouts and salami). The pizza came next (fun guy and spicy sausage) and was doughy and bland. Then the dessert- how can soft serve ice cream be better at McDonald's? The only standout was the ricotta toast.   The ugly: the wait staff was uninterested , disconnected, and just plain cold. I cannot fathom why someone like that is employed in a family-friendly, nay Family-centric!, restaurant such as piccolo piano.   I'm excited to see what restaurant replaces PP. because as it stands, I can't imaging that PP will be around for long."}
{"text":"Eclectic room. We were sat overlooking the kitchen. Initially felt a little strange but the kitchen soon made us feel very welcome, and the opportunity to engage with the head chef and supporting staff soon proved to be a unique and enlightening experience.   We ordered the porterhouse steak - a special for the night. Rare, perfectly cooked. Great care was taken with the steak, with two kitchen staff devoting their undivided attention to it. Carpaccio to start. Served on a bed of cream sauce and topped with arugula and a citrus dressing.   The pizza looked delicious. I will certainly be going back to enjoy those hand spun pies which were lovingly crafted before my eyes, which were then lit up by the sight of the wood oven. Menu was enticing and left much to be envied. The staff was casual but professional and very much made sure we were part of the dining experience."}
{"text":"went for dinner. outstanding food, reasonabley priced. service was quick. the only regret was thst the $45 sampler is only for group of 6 or more. we are only 4 so couldnt have that."}
{"text":"Our table ordered three pasta dishes - including the egg yolk ravioli. While the ravioli was delicious, the toast arrived burnt (black and charred).I raised this with the server, who was quite dismissive of my feedback, stating that the bread is \"grilled\". I brought this up with the manager, and received the same response.Even if food is grilled it should not arrive to a customer's table black and charred.  This experience is reflective of my past experiences with Piano Piano - that while they cook their pasta quite well, everything else on the menu seems to fall short. At these prices, you are better off at other Italian restaurants in Toronto that can serve a good all around menu without a slice of the attitude."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our first wedding anniversary. We had been looking forward to it for weeks after reading very positive reviews, but unfortunately we were a bit disappointed. We were expecting a relaxed romantic meal, but instead it was rushed. The server forgot our appetizer, which mean that all of our food came right away. They gave us free dessert, as a result, which was nice, but we still felt we spent a lot of money for a meal that felt rushed and not special. The pizza was really good, so I might go back, but probably not for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived, we were told by the host that we had no reservation. I replied that I had a confirmation. He said we had no reservation. I showed him the confirming email from Open Table. He rudely told us again that we had no reservation. He also told us he had no tables available. Needless to say, I was fuming. We had dined many times at the previous restaurant in that location \"Splendido\" and wanted to try this new one. We were then approached by another employee. He said he would look into why they had no record of our reservation. He came back and said they gave our table to another patron with the same name as mine. I thought that was a very feeble excuse. I was still fuming, and told him so. He said he could seat us somewhere, and then said and I quote \"you will not enjoy your dinner here!\" and something to the effect that we should leave. I have since leaned that his name is Jeff Dinan, but I have no idea of his position. I cannot believe that a restaurant opened for a very short time has employees that greet first time patrons with this disgustingly rude attitude.  Whoever was at the host desk should have immediately apologized for the mix up, and suggested we have a complimentary drink at the bar while they located a table for us. Obviously, they have a lot to learn about the hospitality business. Take a big pass on this one."}
{"text":"FOOD: had the caccio e pepe which was very good. Pizza was average.   PRICE: believe it was $24 for a plate of entree sized pasta which is expensive in my book. Even Eataly doesn't charge this much and we're not talking about the Batali's, Camellini's or Michael White's of the world.   FAKE: however, the restaurant pretends to have Aesop hand soaps in the bathroom. But in reality, they bought 1 bottle and then refilled it with cheap pink commercial soap. What a joke. Think people wouldn't know any better?  Can't support restaurants that act high end but are CHEAP and FAKE.   Will stick with eating at high end Italian restaurants in NYC and making pasta while in Toronto."}
{"text":"Although I cannot comment about their food yet, I am writing a review to commend Piano Piano's great customer service! We came on a random Tuesday night and was particularly surprised by how busy it was. We were welcomed by the manager/owner (?) and was asked if it was okay for us to sit at the bar since the restaurant was pretty full. This worked to our advantage since we were able to watch the bar tender craft his drinks while enjoying the view of the rest of the restaurant. Although we didn't stay long since we only came for dessert, we still enjoyed our time. Shoutout to the bar tender who was friendly and very accommodating with our questions regarding the drinks he made. We were also surprised to learn that he sells his own line of Bitters!   I ordered tiramisu to share while my bf had an espresso. To be honest, the tiramisu was nothing special from the ones I've had before. However, it came in a cute fancy little tea cup (think of the ones you have for afternoon English tea parties!), which I thought was interesting.    Great ambience, friendly staff and accommodating service! Looking forward to my next visit to actually try their dishes and cocktail options!"}
{"text":"Dined here with a group of friends after hearing lots of positive things! Usually I'm not one to get excited by the hype, but we found ourselves with the opportunity to visit Piano Piano, and we were quite impressed!  This is not an inexpensive restaurant by any means; each couple spent about $100 without alcohol, making this one of those spots that you only come for special occasions where pricey Italian food is called for.  Chopped salad was great (9/10) -- highly recommend Meatballs were big and tasty (8/10) Ravioli was delicious (9/10) Pizzas were knock-outs (10/10)"}
{"text":"As a new mom, I'm so grateful for this restaurant.  A beautiful space, great service, quality/tasty food... AND change tables in the washrooms?! Thank you!!!  The pasta was legit (had the carbonara served with rigatoni, just like they do in Italy). Cesar salad is a must. But my most memorable bite of the evening was the chocolate tart with salted caramel sauce.  OH MY GOD.    This will definitely make it into our rotation of fave restaurants!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Piano Piano.  The service was excellent.  Very attentive to your table and made recommendations.  The burrata appetizer was delicious.  We also shared the Caesar salad.  Was an interesting take with anchovies and bacon.  Great dressing as well.  I am just a fan of Romaine lettuce in my Caesar so was not too interested in the Radicchio.  Main courses were also quite good.  We had the bone in veal parmesan and a wonderful pasta dish with oyster mushrooms and truffle oil.  Great decor with open concept kitchen in back.  Meals did not come out too quickly.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went to Piano Piano on a date night with my boyfriend and we had an incredible time! From first walking in and being greeted by the hostess' and service throughout the evening and until we left was great. The food, atmosphere, service, cocktails and wine were amazing! The server was very attentive and gave some great recommendations on some favourite dishes as well as portion sizes. The restaurant is great for date nights, nights out with friends and large groups. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go here after reading Toronto Life's top 20. If you know Italian food this is not the place for u. If your tastes are East Side Mario then it's like a Fancy East Side Mario. They ran out of pizza dough on a Monday, maybe that would have been the saving grace. The portions were a good size, and the coffees were good. All else wasn't. It was meh at best. The waiters seemed bored, then again that might be their vibe. There are plenty of great Italian and modern Italian places to Eat in this city this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Piano piano a hidden flowery entrance opening up to an unexpected large dining area. The interior is decorated with flower paintings and pretty decor. This restaurant is perfect for date night or a night with the girls. The food is delicious and the service is quick. I ordered the egg yolk ravioli with a side of garlic bread. The garlic bread was a generous portion (in not complaining). My boyfriend order spaghetti and meatballs, he enjoyed it but it was pretty plain Jane, lack of flavors."}
{"text":"There are a lot of restaurants in Toronto that get more hype than they deserve - Piano Piano deserves its stellar reputation. From the moment you arrive at the restaurant to the time you leave, you feel like you've had an experience. The gorgeous floral facade is mirrored by beautiful decor inside the restaurant. The service is professional, knowledgeable and nice. The only thing better than the decor and service is the food.   We had the mortadella, burrata, bolognese, veal parmesan and rapini. The burrata is the best I've ever had. It sits on a bed of pesto with juicy tomatoes and crisp bread. It's just lightly smoked with no artificial flavour. It's mouthwatering.   I can't wait for my next meal there."}
{"text":"Stopped by Piano Piano in the old Splendido location for a date on Saturday night.  Service was prompt and accommodating. We wanted to split a few things which was handled properly and the plates disappeared in what felt like seconds after we cleaned them off. We managed to get through four courses in just over an hour and were early for our show.  Food was all very good, we tried the escargot, carbonara, trout and tiramisu. Escargot and mushrooms were soft & rich and came with some crunchy crumble & lemon to balance things out. The trout plating looked interesting, as it came with some deconstructed mashed potatoes. But everything on the plate worked together to make our nights most memorable dish.  Overall the meal satisfied and piqued my interest enough for a second visit, which feels like four stars."}
{"text":"***4.5 stars***  My husband and I made a reservation to Piano Piano to celebrate our anniversary. When we got to our table, we were surprised with Prosecco for our anniversary - they actually read my note on when we made our Open Table reservation.  It was a nice touch to start off our dinner.  The food was great - we ordered Burrata & Garlic Bread as our appetizers and they were delicious.  The Burrata had a nice bland acidity to balance the creaminess.  The garlic bread was amazing - it was like a mini garlicky goodness pizza.  For our mains, my husband got the bolognese ravioli and I got the Fun Guy pizza.  We did not realize that the garlic bread was like a pizza or I would have ordered something else.  Regardless, our mains were super yummy.  We had room to share a dessert - the Chocolate Caramel Budino was a lovely finish to our meal.  Service was excellent.  I would highly recommend Piano Piano for a night out for great food!"}
{"text":"Disappointing Food. Sub-par Service. Will not return.  Made a reservation with high expectations after hearing good things about this spot. The food was delivered to our table cold and tasted like it had been prepared by East Side Mario's. Our Waitress was unable to coordinate our main courses to arrive after our appetizers and before we knew it our table was covered in plates, some balancing off the edge of the table.  When we mentioned this to her she became extremely defensive and accused us of lying... not sure what that was about.  Overall disappointing meal start to finish. With so many quality Italian restaurants in this city, do not waste a meal on this spot."}
{"text":"I come here probably every week, and it is in the \"top 5\" restaurants of mine. I always sit at the bar and see Tony, who is incredibly nice and knows mine and my boyfriends drink by heart (in other words the service is amazing). The canestri Alla vodka pasta is my all time favourite here. As a salon manager with a large clientele base, I always recommend them to come here!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for mine and my sisters birthday. Decor is beautiful, service is not very good. Food is pretty good, but nothing special. We made reservations, yet they sat us at a communal table, so we asked to be moved, and even though they had other empty tables put us in the very back beside the noisy kitchen. We had already moved once, so weren't going to ask again.   Our server was not very friendly, or helpful. We had to ask to order entrees, didn't check on us once, and took forever to bring us a dessert menu. For the prices, I would expect attentive service, and top notch food. Food was pretty good but small things like chipped plates, no toilet paper in the bathroom, lack of water refills, all negated that. Many better Italian restaurants in the city at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Must Try: Egg Yolk Ravioli, Meatballs  Rating: (9/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Came here for the Egg Yolk Ravioli, but coming back to try more! Serving up some mean Italian food, this spot is has an amazing ambiance with an authentic menu.  The decor was amazing, and the prices of food were reasonable. Interested to try the pizza next time, but the pasta and meat dishes we had were amazing. The Sharing Octopus also looked amazing (at least looking at the table beside us).  The restaurant was fully packed, so reservations are a must. It was a bit loud when I went, but I think it was really because of the table beside us, and not the norm for the overall loudness.  Friendly service and overall very clean."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable transformation to this space.  Having dined at Splendido before, I was anxious to try their newest endeavor and my expectations were exceeded once again.  Great menu (Bolognese, Sardines and Escargot were what I had) nice cocktails and a warm, colorful and vibrant environment.  Very family friendly too!  This will be a regular stop for us when we visit the city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been told my various people in different social circles how amazing Piano Piano is. After about a year of wanting to go, we finally went, and we now know why we kept hearing about it. It is incredible!!! We had the Smoked Burrata appetizer, the Spicy Sicilian pizza, the Canestri alla Vodka pasta, the Brussels Fritti side, and the Nutella Tiramisu dessert. With the exception of the Smoked Burrata, all of the meals were some of the best Italian food we've had, and would definitely get again. The Smoked Burrata wasn't anything special in our opinion. I was amazed by the quality of the food and the service, yet the prices are totally reasonable. The ambiance was nice, our waitress was very helpful and attentive. We will absolutely be coming back here, and I am already looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I didn't really get the hype of piano piano till I recently went to celebrate with some friends, and OH MY is it incredible. But so is the price tag ($$$$) so I would recommend this spot for special celebrations and intimate dinners rather than your average Italian restaurant outing (ahem - Terroni's).   We ended up opting for the family style sharing menu for four of us. Was about $55 dollars a person and they were really flexible with us changing a few things on the set menu. We swapped one of the pastas to try the bolognese and this was a hit amongst the group. The mushroom pasta was amazing (but I still think Cafe Nervosa's is better). The Cesar salad was nothing special, though the server was raving about it. Everything else hit the spot and was VERY fresh and well prepared, especially their chicken dish on a bed of savoury polenta. YUMMM.   One thing that sets this restaurant apart from others is their swanky decor and smashing good service. The waiter basically became our best friend and was kind enough to bring us a round of negroni drinks and chocolates as he knew we came to celebrate our friends' engagement.   One last tip. Make resos a week or two in advance to get a decent seat at a reasonable time.   Overall, 5 stars and would go here again. Thanks for an incredible night!"}
{"text":"Brought my family here for my moms birthday on Thursday night. This was our second time visiting the restaurant and it didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed the quality of the food. The calamari was to die for. One of the best I've had. I also ordered the mushroom cavatelli and the homemade ice cream for dessert. Unfortunately our waitress informed us that the restaurant was having problems with their yeast and that they would not be able to serve pizza. Hopefully on my next visit I will get to try one."}
{"text":"tonight we decided to try the rebirth of splendido, the apps were one hour in waiting. As i looked around the room no one seem to be eating.  When we finally were served our pasta it was not el endente but raw. My veal parm was a veal chop that was well overly cooked and tasted like leather. The worst part of this so called meal was the sauce. It was crushed tomatoes with a litttle garlic. It was raw and could not be eaten. We will never go back. Pizza Nova has a better tomato sauce. Oh Yea we received our apps after our main course. I guess thats how they do it in Italy."}
{"text":"Tasty food, lousy service. I had one of the pizzas (\"The Bitter\") and one of the pastas (\"Canestria alla Vodka\"). Both were very good.  I didn't have a reservation, and I appreciated that they squeezed me in (at the counter overlooking the open kitchen), but then they essentially forgot I was there. I waited almost 30 minutes to place my order. I thought about leaving, but had limited time, and had already committed to the spot. I turned all the way around in my chair and caught the server's eye a few times before she finally came over, with no acknowledgment or apology for the incredibly long wait.   Food-wise, It reminded me somewhat of Frankies in Brooklyn (which is a compliment), except the service there is warm and attentive (probably one of the few times New York will beat Canada in this category!)."}
{"text":"Hi all - let me preface this with i'm a pretty reasonable customer. I'm okay with waiting, but this was ridiculous. Worst service that you'll get your life.  My girlfriend and I came in for our anniversary dinner and piece of advice please NEVER EVER GO HERE IN YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!   We ordered our food at 9:20 and by 10:40 we did not receive anything past one of our appetisers. After we complained to the waiter and then the manager we got a cocky answer along the lines of \"don't worry about it please leave\".  One of my most disappointing meals in Toronto, I would rather eat at Ali Baba's where at least the service is mildly consumer friendly."}
{"text":"I love Piano Piano! I've been there twice and their food is delicious and fresh every time. I love the lamb chop and pasta. My girlfriend gets the veal and it is to die for. The carbonara is delicious. Their desserts are divine. The atmoshpere is interesting. It has this modern romantic and casual vibe. Staff is great and very attentive. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was perfect for a night out in the city, the prices were slightly expensive however the quality of the food and the beautiful atmosphere made up for it and made it totally worth it! Great customer service, I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"The single most delicious dish I have consumed in a long time came during our first course at PP the other night: ravioli Bolognese. Home-made pasta stuffed with ricotta and surrounded by a Bolognese of singular distinction: meaty, textured, deep flavour, some parmesan or gruyere on its margins. WOW!  Service and the other dishes were fine, wines reasonably priced, unpretentious atmosphere and the place full but not uncomfortable for our 9 pm reservation. But as I told the cooks in the open kitchen, near which we were seated, on our departure, next time I come it will be to have that ravioli for a first and second course!   Other proprietors - restaurant, grocery stores, any service industries - might well envy our waitress' spontaneous remarks about management, which I paraphrase: they treat us so well, we get to take the fresh pasta home when the sell date is about to expire, really nice people. To me, that is an indicator of a fine place heading north, not south, during these difficult times when the restaurant industry in particular is being battered by absurd minimum wage increases."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I hosted a group dinner here with 14 people, and the staff was both incredibly accommodating before, and the food they brought out was amazing.  The set menu did not have any pizzas (which is a specialty), and I asked if they could add it - no problem!  Everyone was stuffed, and the food was just all around delicious. We were treated great, the food was great, and the service was great.  No-brainer."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident on a business trip to Toronto. The atmosphere, decor, staff and food was top notch and I feel confident in saying this by far the best meal I have EVER had. Piano Piano will be my go to place when in the city and I highly recommend making it yours."}
{"text":"It had been too long since I'd seen a couple of my favourite gals over the holidays, so off to Piano Piano for some dinner and drinks. Less than 10min walk from Spadina Station, it was easy to find. A small venue, but classically decorated with high ceilings and big floral prints on the walls and their staff. Even though, it's not a large space, it FEELS like a large space. They were smart not to cram as many tables as possible in.     The menu looks like a newspaper! We looked all sophisticated, browsing the paper. ;) Our server was incredible. Enthusiastic and knowledgeable, the perfect combo! He answered all of our questions as well as helped is pair wines with our meals. I'm barely a novice when it comes to wine and I'd never heard of any of these, so I definitely needed the help.    The food decision was harder, but we got there. I ordered the Meatballs($22) and my ladies both chose the Pumpkin Agnolotti($24). You read it, I literally just ordered meatballs, nothing else. They were freaking awesome. It came as 4 giant balls o' meat, coming to a  1/2 pound. Smothered in a savoury, spicy tomato sauce and served with toast and topped with fresh basil leaves and parm; challenge accepted.     We all thanked our lucky stars for stretchy pants that day. So full. The wine pairing with the food was perfect. They were able to finish their pasta, but I was not able to complete my mission. The portions were generous, so generous that we did not have room for dessert!    A great venue with great service and great food. Win/Win/Win"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great dining atmosphere with really impressive decor--chic, vibrant, intimate. The service was quite good and we got our food reasonably fast. Tried the veal parmesan, brussel sprouts and spaghettone verde..all delicious choices. However, because the flavours were quite rich and complex, I'd recommend sharing dishes amongst the table, since the dishes can start to feel quite heavy and the flavours overpowering.   The tomato sauce for the veal was a little on the sour side, but the meat itself (which was a massive piece!) was very tender and balanced well with the cheese. The brussel sprouts tasted really good the first few spoonfuls, but by the end started to taste salty. The fresh pasta (which had roasted tomato, rapini, olive oil etc) tasted the best, with an atypical \"green\" sauce that tasted quite good. Nutella tiramisu, although smaller portion than expected, was made really delicately and I appreciated that.  Will be back to try other dishes, including the pizza!"}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant did not live up to its expectation.   Food: The food was... well, they tried. Trying to plate edgy and trendy can work well when it's done correctly. Unfortunately, Piano Piano missed the bus on this one.   Service:  Our server wasn't able to coordinate our mains to arrive after our appetizers so our table was covered with plates and bowls. By the time we got to our main courses everyone's plate was cold.   In the restaurant industry, it goes without saying that the customer is always right. Unfortunately, the woman who was serving us was extremely defensive when we expressed our disappointing experience and responded by saying \" that's not how it happened\" and walked away in the middle of the conversation. She also avoided our table for the remainder of the meal and had 3 of her other co-workers service us.   When we notified the manager of our experience he stayed silent the entire time and didn't seem to care that we were leaving disappointed.   In conclusion, mediocre food, terrible service. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday at 1:00 p.m.; we had a reservation so my friends and I were seated right away. I wouldn't say it was too busy, but I would make a reservation just in case.   SERVICE: Although our waiter was very kind, it took quite a long time for our main dishes to come (I would say at least 30 minutes, if not more). The two individuals at the next table who got seated while we were eating our appetizers actually got their meals (both appetizer and entrees) and finished them before we got our main dishes.   LUNCH SPECIAL - choice of an appetizer, any pizza/pasta and a dlb espresso ($24)  APPETIZER: Insalata per Nikki *Recommend*  This dish was delicious! It was light and fresh yet satisfying. The farro made the dish more filling, and the fried chickpeas gave the dish a lovely crunch, offsetting the softer vegetables in the salad, such as the avocados, tomatoes and chickpea puree.   MAIN: Mushroom Cavatelli *Recommend*  I am happy to say that the long wait was worth it! This dish had a wonderfully strong earthy flavour (based on truffle scented oyster mushrooms) and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Despite this dish being on the saltier side, I would definitely order it again.   DRINK: Since I didn't drink coffee, our waiter was kind enough to substitute it for a tea."}
{"text":"I'm unclear about why this restaurant gets so many mixed reviews. My friends and I got the family style menu and I think it's possibly one of the best I've tried in Toronto. We were thrilled with the amount of variety we got - I believe 3 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 pastas, 1 pizza, 1 meat main, 1 side, 2 desserts. Portion sizes were excellent, we were stuffed and actually couldn't finish dessert. Everything was delicious and our waiter provided friendly and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Pizza burnt, pasta flavourless  To bad was looking forward to the Splendido of the past."}
{"text":"Piano piano was amazing! Best gluten free pasta I've ever had! Best pasta maybe ever! I had the calamari to start, the mushroom pasta and chocolate/ caramel dessert.   Everything was fantastic and great service. I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Definitely a foodies find. Great food very cool vibe great service.  Attentive staff. Went on a Sunday.  Totally met our expectations."}
{"text":"Food was deliciously heavy and rich (see pictures).  No complaints. Wear loose fitting pants!   Service was great. Very attentive and accommodating.   Reservations are a must.   Parking is a difficult to find since its in Downtown, unless it's your lucky day."}
{"text":"Incredible food, fabulous vibe and amazing service! We were a party of 15 and the staff were super accommodating and attentive. Our glasses were always filled up, they were always smiling and super kind! The food was perfection! We now know what all the hype is about.   Since we were a large party, we ordered from the family style menu ($49 per person). There was more than enough food and by the end of the three courses, we were stuffed to the brim. Out of all the fabulous food, the calamari fritti, kale salad and the canestri alla vodka are must-haves. Our entire group of friends was astounded by the flavours and quality of the food. The ginger carrot cake at the end was truly iconic. Fluffy, balanced, moist and the perfect way to end a memorable meal. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do NOT order the spagettone meatballs! I can't believe an Italian restaurant can't make a meatball. Crazy dry, dense and rock hard. Burnt on the outside...for $26 (3 meatballs) it was ridiculous. The only thing to write home about was the egg yolk ravioli. That was good. Service was meh. Not really impressed."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience at Piano Piano. The place was super cute and nicely designed with a rustic look to it. Though the service was just average (probably because the server had too many tables), the food was good. I had the carbonara which was delicious. They used a bacatini pasta (which is thicker), it is made fresh daily, the sauce was rich and creamy. My only complaint would be that the carbonara wasn't hot enough and so the dish cooled too quickly which caused the sauce to thicken up. Would definitely come back to try the pizza and dessert."}
{"text":"Heard only good things about this place so we decided to try it out for our girls night out. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday but luckily I was able to snag a reservation for 6:00 the day before! I tried the piano piano spritz and it was a very tasty drink. We ate the calamari, rapini, appetizer size of the mushroom pasta, and the veal Parmesan. We also had red wine with our dinner. Everything was rich, flavourful, well seasoned. And served in family style way. We enjoyed the meal and the service and loved the atmosphere. I always order dessert after every meal and was excited to see that they had a tiramisu... it was a Nutella tiramisu but I still gave it a try. Unfortunately that was the only thing that fell short, couldn't taste any nutella, and it had a thin layer of cake instead of lady fingers. I like my tiramisu the traditional way so if your like me then definitely skip that dessert option because you won't like it. Otherwise 5 stars for food, service, ambience!"}
{"text":"What a great night at Piano Piano.  We went there following the glowing reviews from Toronto Life and were not disappointed.  The Ceasar salad is a dream - the charring of the lettuce adds a nice smoked flavour, the sauce is perfect....just loved it. The smoked burrata was good but a little bland for my taste - would have loved to feel the smokiness more.  For mains we had the ravioli bolognese and pizza \"The Fun Guy\". Both were delicious. I have to agree their pizza is absolutely amazing, and the ravioli were pretty good too - with a rich sauce with a bit of a kick that blended really well with the rich ricotta ravioli.  For desert we ended with the Tiramisu - unfortunately they were out of the Lemon Cake. The Tiramisu was fantastic...I was originally put of by the \"Nutella\" in the name of the desert -- forget that - it's the most delicious hazelnut mousse taste, and it works!   Service was very attentive and timely, but not overbearing. The atmosphere is noisy but delightful.  Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Love how this place has transformed. Very lively and a great place to hangout with friends or go on a date. The food was amazing and the portion are very generous. Came here for my belated birthday dinner and the staff are super friendly. I loved the drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Piano Piano is a whimsical Italian restaurant that specializes in thin crust pizza among other items. The atmosphere is playful but sophisticated. I like the open kitchen concept at the back of the restaurant.   We went as a large group. To make it easy, we chose the family style menu - where the chef created a tasting menu for us so that we can get the full experience of Piano Piano. We sampled a few of the salads, pizzas, pastas, mains, sides and dessert.  The food was pretty good. I must admit that I liked certain dishes better than others. For example, I was not a fan of the Pretty Woman pizza but that's because I do not like black olives and anchovy. I did enjoy the Smokey Bear pizza that came with smoked mozzarella.   The price was reasonable for the family style menu. We were able to get a good sampling of the menu. If you are going as a large group, I would definitely recommend the family style menu - you get a better experience."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is chic, sophisticated and beautiful - looks very different from the outside. And the ambience is lively. I went here on a Wednesday night with two friends and we needed a reservation.   We ordered two appetizers, a pizza and a pasta to share, and that was enough food for the three of us. The chopped salad and smoked burrata were delicious. The fun guy pizza was ok, and does not deserve the rave recommendations by our waitress. The pizza dough was soft and glutenous, and I prefer my pizza dough to be more crispy. We got the special pasta with pesto and it was good, because you can't go wrong with pasta.  We also each had a couple of drinks. My friends really liked the rosemary negroni, but be aware, the taste is on the strong side so it's more for those who appreciate a strong taste of alcohol. We also tried the piano piano spritz, which was delicate and light  - beautiful, but I didn't feel like I was drinking a cocktail.  Overall, we had a lot of fun. The service was amazing. It's a nice place to go for a special occasion, but I'm not sure I would go there again. The prices were very expensive for the portions, and the flavours just weren't there to match. I think I prefer Terroni and Gusto 101 to Piano Piano."}
{"text":"Checked out Piano Piano last night and was really impressed. I went to Splendido when it was there and I thought the decor is much warmer and fresh this time around.   I had the Caesar salad to start and it was really tasty. There was a nice piece of pork belly in it as well. A different take on the salad but it came together really nicely.   I had heard/read mixed things about the pizza (how salty they can be) so I gravitated towards the ravioli bolognese and I could have licked that plate clean (seriously, I ate the entire thing) AND proceeded to order the strawberry cake for dessert.   I really enjoyed this spot. Service was good. Food was fantastic. There were big shoes to fill once they replaced Splendido but they did a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"I was excited about coming here, with my daughter and another couple and their kids. As advertised on their website, we would get to enjoy their wonderful fine dining while letting our kids run around in their dedicated kids corner.   I think I might have expected too much. The food was okay, not exceptional, and I found it quite overpriced. We got the braised short rib (small for $20+), carbonara pasta (dry, and not flavourful), smoked burrata (tasteless, and over priced at $19). Pizza was good, but the crust was soggy. Also all their pizzas had chilli on them, which not everyone, especially kids, can eat. Dessert was good. Lemon goat cheesecake, and the nutella tiramisu I did love.   The kids meal was over priced too. $12 for choice of 3 things, but very small portions, dry chicken breast, 4 tiny meatballs, some cheese. And no drink or fruit included (at least include milk?).   Don't get me wrong, the space was great and really appreciated how my daughter could run around. But there wasn't much to do except 1-2 old toys, some books and dress up bin that no one touched, and a chalk board. There was a tv in there with netflix, and once turned on all the kids became zombies  - which depends on how you look at it, good or bad thing. not every parent wants to give their kids screen time.   I was annoyed when the kids area seemed to be occupied by lots of other families where the adults liked to stand around the entrance like a wall with their wine glasses, instead of getting down to the level to play with their kids. It was annoying when my little 18 month old wanted to go play and they were completely oblivious.   We were still hungry and went for pizza afterwards. Hate when you pay $50/pp and still need to do this. I do have to say, the food came out exceptionally fast, which is great when you have a hungry toddler."}
{"text":"I should start this review by saying I have a dairy allergy and they were able to accommodate it by suggesting various modifications to their pasta, pizza, and main course dishes. I give my pasta dish 5 stars! The reason for the less-than-stellar review is that the portion was tiny! They offer both an appetizer and main course portion for all pasta dishes. My main course-sized veggie pasta was so tiny that I left hungry and it was $24, which seemed expensive for the tiny portion. I should also note that I have a below-average appetite!   My other complaint is that I made the reservation two weeks prior and we got a shared table. I came with one guest and we were seated at a long table with a birthday party so it was quite noisy. I asked if we could be seated elsewhere and were told our only option was the bar so we elected for the shared table. I was frustrated when I noticed several open tables closer to the entrance that were not offered to us. I asked if these were reserved for walk-in customers and we were told that they are \"last resort\" tables. I would have preferred this over a loud shared table!  We were in and out within 40 minutes which felt fast for a Friday date night. It felt a bit rushed. Our orders were taken right when we sat down and we had to ask for bread to be brought to the table. Maybe these are the kinks that come with a new restaurant but I am underwhelmed ..."}
{"text":"The service was great. We had the cauliflower and the buretta as apps.  We had the mushroom pasta (appetizer size) and the veal. Plenty of food.  We didnt finish the veal. But theres always room for desert and had the nutella tiramisu which was delicious"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see this place has less that 4 stars. I think it's great! The dining room is spacious and beautifully decorated. The service is relaxed but decent. And the food is excellent (I highly recommend the Burrata and the spicy pasta). The first time I went was with a big group and we did family style which was superb - the food just kept coming! The second time it was date night and we were lucky enough to get a seat at the chef's counter which was a really cool experience (watching the pizzas come out was mouth watering, I'm getting a pizza next time for sure). Piano Piano delivered perfectly on both of these, very different, occasions. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Went on a Thursday evening and got seated right away, group of 6. Our server was friendly, helpful, and checked in a few times to make sure everything was going well.   FOOD: We ordered a variety of plates to share, both appetizers and mains. Overall, the portions were generous and filling for six.  Smoked Burrata - This dish was highly recommended by the server as she mentioned it was the most popular appetizer. We had it with the bread, overall the burrata was smooth  and good with the bread  The Smokey Bear pizza  - This was the pizza with the speck/ham. The flavours were OK, slightly soggy  Egg Yolk Raviolo  - This came with 2 pieces and we shared it amongst the 6 of us which was fine. Overall the egg yolk was cooked well and tasted light   Ravioli con Bolognese   - This tasted good but I personally thought that the Bolognese sauce was on the salty side   Bone-In Veal Parmesan - This was my favourite dish of the night, the veal was flavorful and tender and tasted very good with the tomato parmesan sauce   Mushroom Agnolotti  - I was excited for this dish as I'm a big fan of mushroom pasta but this one was just OK  -you could taste the truffle but I felt that the pasta was a little dry and could have used a little more sauce   Nutella Tiramisu - Had 2 of these to share between the 6 of us, it was creamy and tasty!    Cocktails -  Had a \"Nonna's Garden\" for a drink, it was good, a slight twist on the Moscow Mule. If you like the Moscow Mule you would like this too, and the cucumber added a refreshing element to it!  AMBIENCE: Love the cute and artsy décor of Piano Piano! The outside of the restaurant is painted pink and gave it an Italian vibe. The decoration inside had a lot of character - frames, flowers, funky paintings and a piano downstairs. The restaurant was spacious and would be a good for a dinner with a group of friends.  Overall, my experience was a good one but I thought the food was OK nothing really stood out to me. If I had the option I would rate this a 3.5 instead!"}
{"text":"I can see why people love piano piano since the ambiance was good and the Food was pretty good and it's worth the try. However, based off the pricing I thought it would be better. My friend and I both ordered a pasta for main and a starter. We ended up waiting almost two hours for our main, and the waiter only came to refill our water glasses once. The waiter said they were 'just backed up' but we saw plenty of other people come in way after us with their food. Also we were promised that we'd be moved from our high top table after 30min - to a low table but it never happened, and when we asked a second time after waiting for one hour as we watched other walk ins be seated, they said it wasn't possible. I really wanted to like the restaurant but the service was just so bad that my friend and I couldn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant in the city. I've enjoyed the genius of Chef Victor Barry several times now, twice as Splendido and twice as the Harbord St location's current reincarnation Piano Piano. And now with the start of a three-course $30 prix fixe in its downstairs, kid-friendly, Piccolo Piano space, it also become the best food deal in the city. Forget the stingy portion sizes of other downtown restaurants, you will leave stuffed and in a state of culinary bliss. Forget cooking, I'm coming here every weekend   Still don't believe me? Check out the fresh review from the Globe: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/experience-joyful-unpretentious-fine-dining-at-torontos-piano-piano/article30826050/"}
{"text":"gorgeous space and atmosphere. perfect for a date night or celebration. service was attentive and friendly.   we had the smoked burrata, roasted cauliflower, ravioli con bolognese, bone-in veal parmesan and two bottles of wine.   recommend the ravioli to any pasta bolognese lovers, it was amazing. heavy and rich in flavour. the veal has spicy soppressata, such a game changer. the best veal i've ever had. great wine selection.   reservations are a must, this restaurant is booked weeks/months in advance. or try your luck with the DINR app."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Within 24 hours both owners contacted me separately to apologize for our unpleasant experience. They generously offered a refund, and I would be willing to try again after such a nice effort from the both of them. Thank you!     I have been looking forward to trying Piano Piano, and was delighted when my friends chose it as a restaurant to celebrate at.  We made a reservation for 6 people about 4 weeks prior to the Saturday night. The reservation was for 8pm. Two days before the reservation, I called the restaurant to let them know we were celebrating a pregnancy and birthday, and asked if they could do a nice dessert surprise. They said absolutely.  Our party of 6 arrived promptly at 8pm and was told our table was not yet ready. At about 8:15 we were growing impatient and spoke to the host who was also the general manager. His tone was rude and off putting and he said they were working on seating us, but \"they're very busy and a lot of people showed up tonight.\" We explained that it was nice a lot of people showed up, but we had made a reservation for 8pm a month ago.  At 8:30 and still no table, we were growing more frustrated and felt especially bad for our pregnant friend who was expecting to eat around 8. We approached the manager again and his response was \"well do you want to stand over their table and start throwing stuff at them?\" Joking or not, I wasn't very amused and told him we were surprised how unapologetic he was. He then promised to take care of some drinks and dessert once seated.  We ended up getting our table at about 8:40. The service the entire meal was horrendous. We each ordered 1-2 cocktails, appetizers and main dishes which took an unreasonable amount of time to arrive. On 3 different occasions we had servers bring food to our table that wasn't ours. It all seemed a bit disorganized.  At about 9:30 (still no food) we asked our waitress if she wouldn't mind taking a quick photo of our table while we were waiting for our food to arrive. She told us she's too busy but will try to do it later. A half hour later I asked the person refilling our water and he did it, happily. It took 20 seconds. I find it almost humorous how it's okay to make us wait 40 minutes for a table, yet our waitress cannot spare a few seconds to take a picture of us.  The food was good (thank god other wise I would have been even angrier) when it finally came. As we were finishing up our mains, I decided to get up and remind the staff about the candles in the dessert in case they'd forgotten - since the service was so awful I wouldn't be surprised. They assured me everything would be taken care of.  Meanwhile, the waitress arrived after our meal with a tray of 6 brown looking shot drinks. When we asked what they were she said they are the complementary drinks from the manager. 3 were virgin. We explained that we already drank all that we wanted as some of us were driving home, and also did not want the 3 virgin shots of sugar and juice.  Keep in mind - no one has yet once apologized or acknowledged we waited 40 minutes overtime for our table and still did not have our food by 9:30.  Sure enough our desserts came, and there were no sight of candles or sparklers  or anything to acknowledge we were celebrating two very special occasions. At this point my friend and I were livid and went up to the manager asking what happened to the candles that we had reminded them of 15minutes prior. His response was \"oh ya hm what happened?\" And he took off.  A few minutes later they brought over a strawberry shortcake with some sparklers. No apology, no explanation, no nothing.  The service was appalling. The lack of apology for everything we experienced was disgusting. It's hard to understand how a restaurant manager at an upscale restaurant thinks it's acceptable to behave like this!  I would NEVER return nor would I ever recommend this restaurant to anyone. Our 8pm reservation turned into a 3 hr meal, most of which was spent waiting for our food. If we had plans after dinner they would have been ruined.  A little apology goes a long way. They had every chance to make this right but sadly seemed not to care, otherwise they could have tried to make our experience a much more pleasant one. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I never had the pleasure of experiencing Splendido before it closed, however given the opportunity to experience Chef Victor's newest and recently opened Piano Piano restaurant with some colleagues, I jumped at the chance.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, from the flower murals adorning the facade of the building, the oversized mirrors and unique artwork in the dining room, to the black banquettes lining the walls and creating cozy eating spaces.  It feels fresh and feminine and unpretentious.  The menu (designed to look like newsprint) consists mainly of pastas and pizzas with a few options for entrees. Menu items range from $16-19 for appetizers, $22 for any of their colourfully named pizzas, $16-$24 for pasta (small vs large sizes), and main entrees from $22 for \"the cheeseburger\" to $58 for a twice cooked chicken meant to be shared by two (or five as per our wait staff). Desserts range from $9-18. A couple of side dishes were available for $9.  After carefully considering the menu, my colleagues and I opted for the $45 family style tasting menu, which enabled us to try several of the menu offerings for a very reasonable price. The selection of dishes brought to our table was like a symphony, with each course building on the next.  Our meal started with a couple of starters including smoked salmon, creme fraiche, & capers on toast, and the ricotta on toast, which as simple as it sounds, was wonderfully creamy with a hint of sweetness brought on by the maple syrup and textural contrast of the seeds.   The appetizer course included a delicious take on Caesar salad (with thick cuts of pork belly), a chopped salad (with crispy polenta cubes, roasted brussel sprouts, olives, and crumbled feta), as well as a beef carpaccio dish with spinach and sliced mushrooms. Would definitely recommend the Caesar salad and chopped salad as the flavours were spot on.    The pasta course included the spaghetti vongole e cozze, which was pasta with clams and crispy pancetta. You could definitely taste the fresh brininess of the clams. We were also served a dish of little ricotta filled pillows in brown butter sauce. I could honestly eat those little ricotta gems all day (but would likely need to be rolled out of the restaurant).  The pizza course included the Bitter pizza with kale, dandelion greens, and 3 cheeses which  (despite its name) was quite tasty and the bitterness balanced by the cheeses. I loved the Sweet Hornet, a sweet and spicy pizza with sopressata, black olives, mozzarella, fior de latte, and chilli counterbalanced with a drizzle of honey that made you crave for more. The pizza crusts were thin and have that satisfying light but chewy texture common to Neopolitan style pizza. Chef Victor himself brought the pizzas (and some of our other dishes) out to our table which was fantastic as it gave us the opportunity to be able to give him our positive feedback about the food.  For the main entrees, we shared the veal parmigiana which was served with a generous amount of lightly broiled cheese on top of the veal chop. We also shared the roasted lamb dish which was served with dandelion greens, roasted potatoes, and a roasted leg of octopus. The octopus was slightly chewy but flavourful, and the  lamb was tender.  For our dessert, we shared a very generous slice of the ginger carrot cake which was accompanied by pumpkin pie ice cream and toasted sweet-salty pecans. The cake was so moist and decadent, and the ice cream had such a rich and delicious pumpkin flavour. I ate around the cream cheese icing that frosted the cake as I felt it was tasty enough without that extra sweetness.  I can't say enough great things about the service. Wine glasses were replaced for each type of red wine we tasted/enjoyed. They permitted my friend to bring wine from her own wine cellar. Our server made spot on recommendations about several dishes, including the Caesar salad, the ricotta on toast, and the Bitter pizza. The chef did a great job of accommodating for dietary/textural restrictions that members of our party had.  The lower level of the restaurant is called Piccolo Piano, with a more family friendly menu consisting of small plates/comfort foods and pizzas. Careful thought has obviously been placed in the children's menu as it is full of healthy and delicious sounding menu options.  Given the fabulous dining experience at Piano Piano, I can't wait to come back to try Piccolo Piano with my hubby. Definitely recommend trying both dining experiences at this lovely restaurant.

{"text":"On Tuesday, September 6, my partner arranged for my 70th birthday at piano piano. The total number of guests was eighteen. We had made the reservation about two weeks earlier. We were told because of the number of guests, there would be a limited menu which was understandable. Our reservation was for seven, and we arrived at 6:30. I had never been to Piano Piano but I was very impressed. I loved the decor which was happy and entertaining. Because of the size of our party we were allocated to the basement restaurant called Piccolo Piano. There we took up over half the restaurant.  Upon arrival we were welcomed by the concierge who was friendly and professional. She escorted  us down to Piccolo Piano to show us the seating arrangement. All guests were either escorted or told the directions. While waiting for our guests our waitress, Natalie, who was simply great, sat down with us to determine what we would like the menu to be. There were 6 courses I believe. She explained each suggestion while trying to accommodate me being a vegetarian.  She managed to satisfy both a vegetarian and the meat eaters. She asked if any of the other guests had dietary restrictions such as gluten. She would have tried to satisfy them as well which is difficult as the meal was served at one long table and served in family style, like a Mennonite or Amish restaurant.  That style made the evening more social and helped the guests enjoy themselves even more.   I won't go into what was served ( it's been a few days now and I cannot remember the name of the items). We did have salad, pizza, starters, pasta, meat, and dessert. We ordered  bottles of wine, individual glasses, and individual drinks.  I have talked with some of the guests after the party and every single one had a great time and all of them loved the food. They went on and on about it. I loved all of the food as well, even though I am vegetarian.  They did a great job accommodating me.    The owner came down 3 times to see if we were happy with the meal and service ( we were).  One comment though was that some of the dishes, while delicious , were too salty. Some people like salt, others have weaned themselves off of it. That is hard to please everyone on an item such as a pizza.   Also, while we were there, there was only one table with a family which also had children.  Piccolo Piano is meant for families ( the room has a little side room for children to play). That family left around 8pm. I asked if Tuesday was normally quiet Piccolo Piano and was told that it may be very busy or be like our night we had. I'm mentioning this because it's very possible to have a group of adults at a large party and also have a number of children next to you.  For  us, the stars were shining favorably.   Thanks Natalie for your excellent service and thanks Piano Piano for your environment and delicious food. One of our party decided to have his birthday there as well."}
{"text":"Sorry this place is overrated. Maybe my expectations were too high. At least the dinner is a reasonable price. I left thinking the cocktails were good. Pizza, over cooked and all crust. (Picture included) Ravioli and cavatelli just. Same day reservation is impossible. My advice is to sit at the bar and order the appetizer size on the menu."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate a friend's birthday. Trying to decided which was more disappointing, the service or the food.  Actually, it was a tie."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with Piano Piano. My friends and I tried all the special suggestions from our server and we were very impressed by the flavours and complexity of each dish. I am in love with the floral wall paper outside the restaurant and the decor inside. It's also a very romantic space so great for a date night (if anyone wants to take me)! We tried a pizza, the egg yolk ravioli, the crispy chicken (wasn't expecting it to be so large!), truffle pasta and a fresh salad! Every item was a food adventure with a distinct flavour and wonderful after taste. My friends washed it down with a nice red wine while I had a refreshing grapefruit prosecco spritzer.  The service was very accommodative and nice. Our table was next to the bar and I think I was a little annoying in asking for napkins, more cutlery etc cause they kept falling and they were nothing but nice! Definitely need to make reservations if you'd like to come here!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Italian food. The food and service are always great.  I wish I could eat more because everything is so delicious! The decor is also really cool.  The only downside is it's so hard to make Friday or Saturday reservations as they seem to book weeks in advance.  I've been a handful of times and will continue to recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"this was our first time, nice decor from outside and inside, before you go better make a reservation. we were four people, the mushroom salad very cheesy and tasty, especially the mushroom part, they told us the calamari sold out, so sad!  and the main course we order the pizza \"the fun guy\" and tomato sauce base pasta, octopus for two. we love the pizza the most, the portion of octopus bigger than for two people.  my friends ordered cocktails, they said the drinks were just ok, but food was delicious and service quite nice."}
{"text":"Service, food and ambiance were excellent. Definitely would go back. The sea bass was served different than expected yet I loved it. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"came here based on a recommended and i keep coming back, so apparently i can't get enough! not that i'm comparing at all (because they're completely different) but one of my falvjde pastas is from Carbone in NY, the famous spicy rigatoni pasta. so when i heard they had something similar, their canestri alla vodka, i had to try for myself! again, not comparing, but it is pretty great.  we also had their burrata, which is served with a bruschetta which was very flavorful. we had their house made mortadella which was delicious! my girlfriend ordered their anchovies pizza. which in my opinion was way too salty. anchovies themselves are salty enough but they added olives and it was just too overwhelming. i had one slice and couldn't have more.  i've come back once for a birthday party and we ordered the family platter. it was a great tasting platter, with a little of everything! definitely recommend, i believe it was $50 or so and they were so generous with their portions, we were so surprised. you'll definitely need at least a party of 4/5 to finish it without filling yourself too much before dinner!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for Piano Piano - everyone speaks so highly of this place and I have heard from others that the food is amazing. That is why I booked this restaurant at 9pm on Friday when my friend from Vancouver comes for our food crawl (after her work trip!).  The interior is absolutely beautiful - as you walk inside, you feel like you've entered a new world, with beautiful finishes, artwork, and music for a bumpin night! The artwork is abstract and the people are all having a lovely time... it couldn't be more lively. You have a full view of the open kitchen and the excitement increases for a night of a deliciousness.  We get seated and the waiter says hello and gives us a few moments to decide what we want. When we are ready, we ask our questions but before we get to continue, he's already rushed off to do something else. Finally, we ordered the egg yolk ravioli to share and the grilled octopus for two. I was so excited - two things I've been wanting to try / excited to eat. The egg yolk ravioli was pleasantly surprising with spinach enclosed within the egg yolk, while keeping the insides runny and satisfying. It was a great way to start the meal.  Shortly after our appies, the octopus arrived and it was huge! I think it was more for 4 to share to be honest, but I think t we got half an octopus! The staff used scissors to cut our meal into pieces and ease of convenience which I thought was a thoughtful touch. As I took my first bite, I was disappointed to taste the toughness of the tentacle. I thought this was a one-off and the next piece would be much tender, but that was not the case. Almost every piece I ate was hard to cut, and aside from the grilled flavours, I found this to be extremely underwhelming. The greens and the potatoes had more flavour than the octopus itself, and the only add-on to the dish was a few slices of lemon. I hate to compare it to the impressive dishes from Bar Isabel, and Mamakas but sadly, Piano Piano missed the mark on this one for me.  While I know that this is a much larger dish, and probably more challenging to cook, but I would rather have a smaller dish that is done well, than to make something so large and not execute it properly. To top it off, the service was rushed and I felt like I was being pressured to order more wine or leave, which makes the overall experience very unenjoyable.  I really wanted to love this place.... maybe next time."}
{"text":"3.5/5 - overall rating is accurate, worth trying!  Ended up trying Piano Piano for the first time with my girlfriend after hearing rave reviews. I could see why - the restaurant had a beautiful aesthetic, very modern and chique. The waiters/waitresses were all young and hip, music gave it a hip vibe. The menu was also beautiful and creative, designed like a newspaper with photos of the chef.  We ended up ordering the Canestri alla Vodka and the Bone-In Veal Parmesan. Overall, the food left something to be desired. I enjoyed the meal but I wasn't blown away. Given the hefty price tag, not sure if the food was worth it."}
{"text":"one of the best pastas and pizzas I have ever eaten (my fiancé and I shared both). for context, we have been to italy. i can't wait to return to piano piano."}
{"text":"Loved it! The best dishes were the special entree of the night truffles pasta and the ricotta on toast. The pasta was very fresh and the pizza crust was amazing. Also really liked the sea bream crudo and the caesar salad. The one disappointment was the strawberry shortcake dessert - thought it was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Love this place! We had the Mushroom Agnolotti and the Canestri alla Vodka and both dishes were amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This place serves really delicious food!!  One of my friends wanted to come here before we went to go see a show and she had told me about this place beforehand, so I decided, why not?  While the prices are a bit more expensive than I would normally spend, I thought it was a good decision.  It's pretty cozy inside (we weren't sitting elbow-to-elbow with our neighbours) and we opted to order an appetizer to share, appetizer-sized pasta, and dessert ([x] denotes mine): - Smoked Burrata [x/2 - shared] - Bucatini Carbonara (appetizer size) [x] - Egg Yolk Raviolo (appetizer size) - Mint Chocolate Chip Soft Serve Ice Cream - Nutella Tiramisu [x]  Overall, my bill ended up somewhere in the $60s, so be prepared to spend money on good food!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously bad service, loooonnnngggg loooooooonnnnggggggg waits for boring food.   On May 12, 2016, the Globe and Mail published \"The Secret of Service\", on \"reimagining quality service for the 21st-century consumer\". The article features a profile of Jeff Dinan, Front of House Manager at Piano Piano. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/fashion-and-beauty/fashion/the-secrets-of-ol-fashioned-great-service-in-the-modernage/article29995577/  On reading this article, and having a good laugh reflecting on our terrible dinner there, I sent the following email directly to Piano Piano.   \"Hello Jeff and Co, This morning I happened across your comments in the Globe regarding customer service. I dined at Piano Piano for the first time just this past week, and frankly, I was shocked by the overt lack of service or concern for customer satisfaction. On reading your comments in the Globe, I felt obligated to share our experience and how the most basic, core needs were neglected, if not outright ignored. Your comments seemed to hark to a level of modern sophistication in the dining experience, a sense of knowledge, understanding, and grace. You may want to take it back to basics. We couldn't even get anyone to take our order. There was a long wait to even see a server - this was followed by \"let me just get your drinks first\" when we were now already ready to order dinner. Waiting, waiting, waiting. The server didn't seem to have much opinion on the food, we were a foodie table asking many questions, but with little input he recommended the same dish to multiple diners. We had long waits between courses, and no one bothered to bus our dirty plates until the next dish was in hand. Despite extraordinary waits for food, only one of us was ever asked if we'd like a second cocktail. All of the wait staff seemed to just be hanging out behind the bar, oblivious. When the server finally came by, a solid 25 mins after we'd finished our mains, after we'd all had time to discuss how sad it was that our dirty plates were still in front of us, I told him directly that the wait times this evening had been simply ridiculous. He seemed nonplussed, there was little apology as he finally cleared the plates. He then returned a solid 10 mins later, offering coffee, which we obviously rejected, then an offer of dessert on the house. I was shocked - did he not see the irony in offering us something that we would again have to wait for? By this time, my party, which included two people that had just flown in from the UK and another that had a an early am biz trip, they just wanted to get out of there. We had expected far more efficient service and by this time everyone was just exhausted. I told him I would have loved dessert 20 minutes ago. Again, no real apology, no real reaction. As a comp had been offered, we thought that perhaps an app would be removed from the bill, but there was no such adjustment. I'd also expect a good server to bring over a manager to smooth things out, but no action was taken. All this on a quiet weekday night, with the restaurant less than half full.   We dine out often, and this was just beyond. I adore the nuances of sophisticated service mentioned in your interview, but come on, just make sure your people know how to take an order and bus a plate. Sometimes it's not the little things, its the most basic routines of the job. I recognize that Piano Piano isn't going to match the level of service that Splendido offered, but there is sizeable difference between relaxed service and blatant incompetence.   Lastly, prior to visiting, I was very excited about the children's menu, I thought for sure we'd be back with the kids. It's a splendid idea, but with these wait times? Absolutely not.\"  I never received a response to my email. Kind of says something about \"service\" doesn't it?   As for the food, we won't be missing anything by not going back. There was very little worth mentioning about the food, in general it was unremarkable in every way. High point was the Sweet Hornet Pizza, but only because it's a blatant rip-off of Roberta's (Brooklyn) Beesting Pizza. I've had Roberta's, and the Beesting is far superior from the crust up- it's worth noting that all of the pizzas we ordered at Piano Piano were charred and burnt. Low point: Burrata was rubbery, impossible to share, an insult to the entire concept of burrata. Portion size on the ravioli was laughably small. The music is really bad, the lights are too bright, and the whole environment just feels old - the ambiance is that of 1990's restaurant. It's all a giant waste of time - just go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The old Splendido has been transformed into a beautifully chic space, and we just enjoyed a superb first experience there, top to bottom. Here's what we tried:  Burrata - fabulous; the quality and preparation were right on the money  Crispy Chicken Saltimbocca - sinfully tasty  Pretty Woman Pizza - loved it; exceptionally good crust!! It just had this amazingly fluffy chewiness to it. Yum.  Pasta: Canestri alla Vodka - delicious, well cooked, great amount of heat in the sauce  I also highly recommend the Jalisco cocktail that's made with a bit of spice. As for the Piano spritzer cocktail, I'd probably skip it next time. But overall, the whole experience (and service) was all that!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by talking about the food. The best way to experience this restaurant, I think, is by ordering family style and sharing all the entrees so you get to experience the full range of what this restaurant has to offer!   We started off with a chopped salad, which had a delightful array of thoughtfully combined flavours. We then proceeded to share the Fun Guy pizza, which was rich and savoury, with arugula sprinkled on top to lessen the guilt, and it was probably the most generous portion size wise. We shared the egg yolk raviolo (each person got half) which was one of the more creative pasta creations I've ever had, and definitely worth checking out - they literally have a runny egg yolk inside a ravioli. We finished off our main course with the braised short ribs with gnocchi. We ordered three desserts to share: the mint ice cream dipped in chocolate, the Nutella tiramisu, and the lemon cheesecake, all of which were delicious!   Nota bene: Each dish by itself seemed a bit small portion wise (other than the pizza), and we joked about making a stop somewhere else on the way home, but by the end of the night, we were surprisingly full! Looks can be deceiving, apparently! And at the end of the night, it ended up being only $35 per person!  So how did we actually get there? We got a last minute reservation for a table of 4 on a weeknight at 6:30 pm by calling the night before because someone had cancelled. It would otherwise have been a 3 week wait, so it might be worth calling close to closing time just to try your luck!  And about the service: we had a pleasant experience, and only one person at the table (me) got a beverage! Our waiter was great about telling us about his recommendations on the menu, and we had pretty prompt service. Our water glasses were always (at least half) full.   The environment is pleasant, dim, and spacious, making it a relaxed environment to catch up with friends. They also have a bar and window seating near the front of the restaurant, if that's more your thing.   All in all, this restaurant is worth checking out if you order things family style and share the wealth together :) eating just one dish would probably feel a bit unsatisfying, we because we shared everything, we came away satisfied and full! And it doesn't make too huge of a dent in the wallet to boot!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with an open kitchen and efficient service. Not overly friendly but not snobby. We had the grilled octopus for two which is served with potatoes and dandelion greens. Very good. We also had the chopped salad which was the star of dinner. Delicious. Carbonara was okay...nothing mind blowing but good and quite peppery if you like that. Dessert (Nutella tiramisu) was a let down compared to everything else and pretty small so not ideal for sharing.   We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  This review is for the downstairs space, Piccolo Piano, where I dined with my toddler last night.  First off, I can't say enough good things about the service. Our server, Michael, was incredible and I was so impressed with how good he was with the kids in the restaurant (my almost 3 year old and a 2 year old at the neighbouring table). I appreciated that he spoke to them like they were regular (adult) patrons at the restaurant, asking them if they needed anything and how they were enjoying their meals or even whether they would prefer their drink in a sippy cup or regular cup. Even the kitchen staff who brought out items were very sweet.  The kids menu is probably the best I've seen anywhere in the city, with many healthy choices and enough customizable options to satisfy even the pickiest eaters. My daughter opted for the macaroni with a side of baked broccoli. She inhaled the food, so I think she enjoyed it. :)  For myself I started with the oysters with apple and jalapeno. They were delicious and fresh. My only critique was there were shell bits in each of them, so whoever shucked them needs a little practice on that front.  For my main it was hard to choose from the array of pizza and pasta options, but I opted for the lamb neck papardelle which had really great flavour and presentation. Wish it was a tad hotter temperature-wise but otherwise delicious.  Other bonuses for kids were crayons and a colouring page and a little play nook with chalkboard walls, books, and some play items. The place space could be improved slightly with the addition of some small seating, a table and/or a rug as it was a little sparse, but nice effort.  Bonuses for the adults include a nice wine and cocktail list and the main upstairs dining area is beautiful.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a really good place that has received perhaps too much early praise from mainstream Toronto press such as Toronto Life receives a Yelp backlash from customers looking for every possible miscue. That may have happened thus far at Piano Piano. Here is what I found...  1. The place is bustling. At 9:30 on a Thursday night, it was jumping with a young crowd.  2. Service is good- not amazing, yet not horrible either. Food comes out rather quickly.  3. The food is very good and is total comfort food. The brick chicken with polenta for two is its own very hearty meal. Calamari is delicious. Bolognese pasta is great as an appetizer. If I have one complaint, there is too much salt in the brick chicken dish and slightly so in the bolognese. 4. They serve Stella on draught that is both cold and in a Stella glass. (At least one of my stars for this.) As much as I love this craft Ale town, this beer is great with the chicken. 5. The wine by the glass options are insufficient- two reds and two whites. 6. The atmosphere is modern with tables that are close together. If close proximity to the next table and it's conversations are a problem, you might not be comfortable.   All in all, Piano Piano is a good and fun place for dinner. If they keep working on the details, it will still be both popular and truly deservedly so."}
{"text":"best surprise date night ever. i just wanted to stare at the mural outside forever. but inside is even more special. LOVED the unpretentious menu, awesome food and super cute decor. everything from the food to the servers just felt right! such an adorable laid back pretty date place"}
{"text":"Piano Piano is one of those restaurants everybody seems to be talking about, so I just knew I had to try it.  I got a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday night and when we arrived, the place was definitely filling up. I had perused the menu before arriving, so I already knew that I was going to order the Ravioli con Bolognese (Ricotta, Parmigiano, Pork and Beef).  I'll be honest, I wanted to swim in that bolognese sauce. It was so rich and flavorful, and I can genuinely say that it's one of the best meat sauces I've eaten in my entire life. (Seriously!)  The ravioli itself was just so-so. The edges were a little crispy, which was weird, and the filling was completely drowned out by the sauce (which was fine with me, but still). I should also mention that the portion was comically small. The tiny dish came with four raviolis and I was done eating in about two minutes flat. And given that it costs $24 (!!!), I wouldn't say I felt like I had gotten my money's worth.  I will say that I fared much, much better than my dining companion. He ordered the Cheeseburger (Dijonaisse, Lettuce, Strubb's Pickle, Frites) and absolutely hated it. I tried a piece of the meat and I could instantly see why; it didn't have the texture of ground beef and was instead a sausage-like disaster with a horrible aftertaste. It was pretty much an abomination.  I would probably return to Piano Piano if only to revel in the glory that is that sauce, but it does seem exceedingly clear that they've got a *lot* of kinks to work out."}
{"text":"We booked this restaurant with a special request that we are celebrating our anniversary and would like to sit by the arch wall (didn't get it) but that's ok, we were seated on the other wall. The service wasn't that good either, our waiter is impersonable and didn't strike me as someone that genuinely cared for our table. We felt that the tables beside us got better service.   As for the food, the Pasta was just slightly undercooked. For appetizers, we ordered the Cesar salad (slightly burnt) and calamari (Too much batter, Terroni is still the best). We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert and it took awhile to come despite it being pre-made already in the fridge.   The funny thing is, the table beside us was also celebrating their anniversary and the waiter brought out their dessert with sparklers and wished them \"happy anniversary\". I also stated that we were celebrating our anniversary under the reservation, but they didn't acknowledge it. I've celebrated many special occasions at other restaurants and had a wonderful experience every time. I'm very disappointed after leaving dinner at Piano Piano. The restaurant was not welcoming, the prices were on the higher end. I must say, I had a better dining experience at other Italian restaurants like Terroni & Buca. Would not recommend this place, this place is overhyped!"}
{"text":"Splendido was a fantastic restaurant - consistently amazing food and service made it a Toronto classic that would surely be missed. I was excited when I heard about its replacement, Piano Piano, and made a reservation soon after it opened. On my first visit (I have now been twice), I was blown away by the changes that were made to the space - it is completely different, almost unrecognizable. Lively and bright, flowers everywhere, banquets line the walls in the dining room, interesting light fixtures - it certainly seems more feminine and fresh.   Piano Piano is vastly different from Splendido. No table cloths, menus are made to look like newspapers, and wine bottles are priced in groups of $40, $60 or $80. That said, the food and service are still amazing. On both of my visits I saw Chef Victor leave the kitchen to talk with diners, and on my most recent visit he even delivered my pasta (we had ordered the special - speghatonni with BC uni - incredible)!  More about the food. The menu is largely pizza and pasta based, and both are excellent. In my two visits, I have tried the mackerel (great), crudo (nothing to write home about), oysters (on the small side for 3/$9), chopped salad (different but good), pizza (specific one unfortunately no longer on the menu but really great), bucatini all'amatriciana (could have been better), and the uni speghatonni (amazing!).   Chef Victor handled the transformation from Splendido into Piano Piano flawlessly. Piano Piano does casual dining right. Beautiful space, great food and drinks, wonderful service."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed and upset that we just spent $100 at this restaurant. We were mainly attracted by the Piccolo Piano concept and excited to take our baby to a friendly neighbourhood family restaurant. As soon as we stepped through the door we could tell things were a bit off. No one greeted us and a party of three standing to our left was arguing among themselves about why their reservation couldn't be found when the restaurant was completely empty at 5pm on a Sunday. We stood around for a while questioning our own existence/invisibility - could anyone see us? Finally my husband tried to make contact and asked the person behind the bar about where we should go to find our table. That person did not utter a single word but gestured vaguely toward a door. Turns out that door led down to PP. A brief high note of the service happened now when someone helped us store our stroller in the coat room. We were quite hopeful upon seeing the downstairs room and a nice kid friendly vibe. Nice set up in the actual toy room as well (aside from the fact that our friend bashed his head into the unmarked low ceiling). We took it upon ourselves to write \"watch your head\" in chalk on the low beam. Anyway, most of you are likely here to hear about the service and the food. Service: possibly some of the worst we've had in Toronto. No one smiled, everyone seemed tired, we felt completely unwelcomed. Keep in mind the restaurant was completely empty and had just opened, it's not like they were slammed or exhausted from an earlier service. Food: even if our food hadn't been served on a bed of emotional ice, it would have still sucked. I can't even believe how bad it was. So many weird bitter flavors and just too much trying! The chopped salad was over flavoured and confused, the pizzas were burnt and soggy, the pasta was salty, the ice cream was icy not creamy, and the kids' food was bland. I felt like we were on an episode of kitchen nightmares and Gordon Ramsay was going to come out and slap someone at any moment. Keep in mind all of this food is being choked down while the staff just brooded around. Thank god restaurant turnover is so fast on harbord. I can't wait for this place to shut down."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at this restaurant last night. My brother and I took my parents out for their wedding anniversary and we all thoroughly enjoyed our experience.   The restaurant was my dads recommendation from this week's review in the Globe & Mail and it definitely did not disappoint. I initially made the reservation online for 8:30, but they were able to accommodate us at 8 which was our preferred time.   We started off with a bottle of wine, accompanied by Smoked Salmon on Toast, Ricotta on Toast and Caesar Salad. All of them were delicious but the Ricotta on Toast was hands down the table favourite (I'm a sucker for homemade ricotta.)  I decided to order the Spaghetti Vongole, dad ordered the Bone-in Veal Parmesan, Mum with the Spaghetti All' Amatriciana. My brother initially wanted to order a pizza, but by that time the restaurant had sold out of all pizzas. (A reason to go back again I guess!). Instead he ordered the Canestri alla Vodka and was kind of disappointed as it was something he could make at home. Nevertheless, it was still an enjoyable meal overall.   We finished off the night with the Lemon Cheesecake and Soft Serve Sundae, both equally delicious and both I don't regret one bite of. Except this morning when I had to work it off at the gym."}
{"text":"Victor Barry is an extremely talented chef.  His Splendido -- which occupied the site where Piano Piano is now located -- served some of the most interesting and adventurous food in the city.  It was a favourite destination for birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions; and when Chef Victor was on a roll with his multi-course tasting menu, he could wow and amaze even the most jaded of palates.  If Michelin was to start awarding starts in Canada, Splendido was not only in the running, it stood at the top of the lis of conteders.  So, it was with great anticipation that a group of seven of us went to Piano Piano a few nights ago.  We fully understood that Victor had scaled back, and admired his decision to turn out less labour intensive fare so that he could spend more time with his young family.  We also had fairly high expectations, having heard good things from friends who had dined and the relaunched restaurant, and knowing how skilled Victor is in the kitchen.  The first thing to be said is that nothing was bad.  But with the exception of two dishes, nothing shined or was exceptional.  The second thing is that our group did have a good time (a birthday was being celebrated), and we were in very good spirits.  The third thing is that the decor is truly hideous, and quite a shock after the sedate dining room that used to fill the space:  cavernous, garish, loud. A pizza parlour on steroids. Even the lovely downstairs private room, which had been a delight and an oenophilic nirvana -- has been transformed into a cave with the same brash wallpaper top to bottom.  To be clear:  I am *not* pining for Splendido, so back to the food.  The menu is cute, taking the form of a newspaper, and one that recounts Chef Barry's reasons for the radical departure.  Yet the offerings are extremely limited, especially the pasta section, which lists nothing save a egg yolk raviolo  (more on this in a moment) that a half decent home cook couldn't turn out.  The wine list was smart, with bottles in three modestly increasing price ranges,  but also extremely limited. The cocktails, meh.   So, what was \"good\"?   The chopped salad despite the boring name; the bitter pizza (dandelion greens); and the crudo of sea bream.  All more than acceptable. Solidly \"good.\"  There were two flashes, muted ones, of the Barry talent.  The first was a starter simply described as foie on toast.  It came with fresh and charred grapes.  The second was the aforementioned raviolo.  But there were problems The foie wasn't foie.  Instead it clearly was chicken liver. It was \"good,\" but it was chicken liver no doubt about it.  My grandmother would have been able to recognize it as such. The raviolo could have been brilliant -- perfect runny but cooked egg yolk inside atop the spinach ricotta filling.  But the brown butter and pangrattato with which it was dressed was overly salty,  holding the dish back. Some might say ruining the dish, though to be fair that would be a wee bit unfair.  Desserts?  Again limited in the extreme.  And as seven of shared a lemon cheesecake (with graham cracker crust) I felt sad.  Piano Piano is a cliche   (graham cracker crust?!).  In a city that has Terroni, this is distinctly second rate.  And in a city where chef Rob Gentile has repeatedly found new frontiers to explore in the Italian tradition, it's clear that Victor Barry has just given up."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I had pizza and my boyfriend had the ravioli (he was raving about it). My pizza was he smokey bear - thin crust, reminded me of Italy. It was SO good. We also had the calamari to start. I had a glass of wine, he had a cocktail called the firm handshake. We sat at the bar, enjoyed the service by the bartender and really had a great time enjoying our food.  It's looks really beautiful inside too! One thing I like about their menu is how things are price. Ex. Over here all these apps are $9. Or, a good selection of $45 wines, $65 wines and $85. All sorted by price. It was pretty cool.   I suggest giving it a try if you're going out for Italian!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, tall ceilings, great service, always filling up our cups with water, lively Italian restaurant.  Food was decent but I had higher expectations due to the pricing of the dishes.  Between four of us, we shared two pizzas, calamari, burrata and the spicy cavatelli. It wasn't very filling but we were satiated.  Anchovies in the cavatelli were not overpowering and quite flavourful and pickled.  The pasta had a kick to it and was probably the best dish. The burrata was pretty good and very soft in texture.  The pizzas were not that impressive. The bottom was burnt and the crust was puffy and too chewy.  Definitely a lot of crust, more than other ingredients. I was a bit let down as someone had recommended this place, but then noted that the flavours were different the second time around.  Perhaps consistency may also be an issue as well?"}
{"text":"I came here with my partner. We started with the olives/almonds and Brussels friti. I had the mushroom cavateli and my partner had the ravioli bolognese. All of the food was outstanding, the staff very friendly and the atmosphere welcoming and chic. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Overall, the ambiance was romantic with the dimmed lights and the intimate seating! Very much reminds of what you'd see in Italy(or at least what I've seen on TV!) The food service was quick. I ordered the Maccheroni Lisci Carbonara. It was prepared with pancetta, egg yolk, parmigiano and a dash of black pepper. Though I did find the flavor of the black pepper slightly too overpowering. So if you're not a fan of black pepper, you may want to order something else.  I do wish to go back and try their pizzas!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Piano Piano on a Friday night. Restaurant was busy, definitely suggest a reservation. Interior is beautiful - huge tall ceilings and nice accent colours and style.   For dinner we had the ceasar salad, the burrata, calamari fritti, and the fun guy pizza. My favourite dish was probably the burrata - large portion of cheese, grilled bread, basil sauce and a few tomatoes. A great combination of flavours. Ceasar salad was very unique, kind of a deconstructed salad with romaine hearts and pork belly. The pizza was decent (good crust although I didn't love the toppings), and the calamari was good although pretty standard. To finish we had the nutella tiramisu. Tiny portion but was good to share since it was quite rich. Very delicious! Most of the food was quite rich, we definitely over-ordered.   The only thing that wasn't great was for some reason our server wasn't the one who took our credit cards and we ended up forgetting our leftovers (our server had put them away in the back while we finished dessert). Oops! Overall was a nice evening and a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian and a nice night out."}
{"text":"Maybe my new favourite Italian place in toronto. Great ambiance, attentive service and delicious Neapolitan style pizza - I had spicy Sicilian. All my friends had pasta and based on sampling all 3 I could've easily had pasta and still gone home happy."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while now and noticed that they had a fixed menu special! From now until July 31, a three course meal is only 30 bucks. The only downside is that you do not get to sit in the main room but in the piccolo room. I felt I had nothing to lose, the fixed menu was a copy and paste from regular menu except for some of their mains.   For apps, we got escargot and the chopped salad , which we both enjoyed.  We decided to have a pizza and a pasta, just to compare. I was hesitate to get the pizza at first. We got the Spaghetti Vongole and the Bitter Pizza. The pasta was delicious. It was cooked well, the seafood and pasta were fresh. The pizza on the other hand wasn't my favourite. I do not like my pizza soggy. A pizza should hold its shape. This one was soggy and too doughy. We didn't even finish it!  It was an enjoyable meal. The staff was friendly. I just wished we were seated in the main area, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The good: Decor is STUNNING...everything from the outside to the washrooms is beautiful. Food is pretty decent. Tried a few things with a group of people -Smoked Salmon on Toast: good; just as you expect it to taste. -Ricotta on Toast: see above comment -The Fun Guy: absolutely loved this mushroom pizza although didn't care for the arugula on it. Too big and had to pick off. But pizza is delicious Rapini: a bit too spicy for me personally but not bad overall. -Lemon Cheese Cake was fantastic.  -Nutella Tiramisu was delicious. -Wine was good!  The bad: Very poor and disappointing service. This is my reason for deducting two stars. Server never cracked a smile...seemed a bit cold. Everyone at the table was very unhappy with the service. Not sure if it was just the server we got as  the bartender and busboy were lovely. I suppose everyone has a bad day.  I'll return to eat again and enjoy the decor...and to test out if the bad service is a regular occurrence. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The air conditioner was not working and it was hot to eat inside.   We had to send back the charred Brussels Fritti.  They were almost burnt.   Overall my expectations were not met."}
{"text":"My friend and I had such a wonderful experience here, great food, great servers, and overall great atmosphere! I would definitely come here again! I haven't had pasta this gooood and my mind was blown, not even exaggerating, it is true! must tryy! I had the Canestri alla Vodka with Meatballs (which was extra) and it's just GOOD, It was tasty, fresh, the pasta was perfecto and oh lord, the meatball was the cherry on top. There was a bit of confusion ordering the extra meatballs about how many it came in, but we sorted it out with the very helpful friendly and positive servers!!!! ((: The meatballs were enormous and I just became so full, but couldn't stop eating. So I ordered for desert the Sea salt chocolate tart, and fell into a food coma after that. It was soooo worth it ((:"}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for my birthday. About a decade ago, there used to be an Italian restaurant around midtown called Piano Piano. I loved that place. But since then, they have closed and this Piano Piano is likely not the same thing nor the same owners.   It was very nice and mod here but right away you'll feel like you're paying for inflated food prices. The menu was a bit disappointing (was hoping for more variety) and I thought the portions were a bit small.  Our server was annoying. I am clearly pregnant and could not drink (mentioned it also). So we didn't order any alcoholic beverages. Right away the server had this look on his face like oh it's one of these people. He was much friendlier to other adjacent patrons who had ordered drinks. I already knew I wasn't coming back at this point no matter how good the food might be. The food took a while to come. It was like we were forgotten. I think it was over an hour before the entree even came.   We ordered...  Chopped Salad Salami, Olives, Feta, Brussel Sprouts, Oregano, Crisp Polenta, Dandelion  18 This was yummy and interesting. The flavours were good. Not sure if it's worth that price however.  Calamari Fritti Lemon, Chili, Parsley  16 - It was a bit small and it could have been crunchier  Rigatoni Carbonara  Pancetta, Egg Yolk, Parmigiano, Black Pepper  16/24 - My husband ordered this... maybe he will review it  Mushroom Cavatelli  Truffle Scented Oyster Mushroom, Parmigiano 16/24 - ordered the large portion but it wasn't filling at all. However, it was tasty. I could have had a burger after this, and that was what we did afterward. Hit McDonalds.   Food was just about average. If you want service make sure you order drinks. I agree with other reviewers who mentioned it was a bit snooty here."}
{"text":"Fall in love with this place from the first sight: decor, lighting and service- everything was on point! Their Ravioli con Bolognese is a must try and don't miss out their warm olives with almonds appetizer. Restaurant is busy, so waiting time might be a bit longer but it is definitely worth it. We were seating at the bar and to be honest that wasn't the best choice. I would recommend to book a table in advance."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I really can't fault anything about this restaurant.  The service was awesome. The waitress (Victoria?) was friendly and very helpful.   The food was simple, fresh and delicious. The portions were generous.   The decor is fun, eclectic and comfortable. Perhaps a bit too dark for me? But I guess that's the mood they're going for.  The thing I like most about Piano Piano is that it's completely unpretentious. It lives up to its name."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this restaurant, both the interior and exterior have a very cool vibe; beautiful without being overly pretentious. I've been wanting to try Piano Piano for awhile and it did not disappoint. My girlfriends brought me here for a belated birthday dinner and both the service and food were spectacular. I had the calamari and truffle pasta and both were delicious. We ended the meal with a decadent carrot cake meant for 2 but big enough for the 4 of us to share! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would have expected more from what used to be Splendido.  Went for dinner on Monday night.  The restaurant was quite busy for a Monday, which may have been part of the problem.  The waitress, though nice, seem to be \"in the weeds\" with little help and was quite unattentive.  We waited a long time for drinks which were decent.  My GF ordered a medium well steak which came out extremely rare.  Once we finally got out servers attention, she did take it back only to bring it out again, almost just as rare.  We then decided to simply forgo the steak.  In fairness, it was the kitchen that let her down and she did take the steak off the bill.  I had the clams which were mediocre at best and really not a lot of food.  Quite flavorful, yet extremely oily.  The décor is very nice and I would be willing to try again with the hopes that they simply had an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY!!  Went with a friend Sat night (Aug 5-17). The food was amazing and the service was great!  We tried the calamari, Berkshire prosciutto, appetizer portion of the Ravioli con Bolognese   and the Fun Guy pizza.  The food was delicous!!   And now dessert - we ordered the Ginger Carrot Cake (For Two). OH WOW! This could easily feed 4. It was so good!  I can't wait to go back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner, and the outside of the restaurant is so pretty with the pink flowers wall and the inside of the restaurant was also very nice with all the fun wallpaper walls.   I have order the Rigatoni Pasta, it was a white creamy sauce $24 My bf order The Spicy Sicilian pizza which had Fior di Latte, Tomato, Parmigiano, Spicy 'Nduja, Sicilian Oregano  $22  My pasta tasted very good but it was such little portion. My bf pizza was really burnt and when asking they said that's how it's supposed to be... I understand that there should be some char on it but all I taste was black uneatable burnt pizza. The staff here were friendly but kept pushing us to get more alcohol drinks.   Overall I would visit again because I did enjoy my pasta and love the interior of this restaurant for nice Instagram photos."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner recently. The goods: as most people say, the decor is really lovely, and the place felt spacious and though full, it did not feel crowded or noisy. My favourite dish was the Crispy Chicken Saltimbocca. The okays: San Daniele Mortadella and my main The Fun Guy pizza because both were decent but nothing particularly interesting flavour-wise. I would also say that the service was just okay. Even though there seemed to be a lot of people working, we often had to wait a while to get someone to come over and answer a question or take an order. There were no real bads, but the beer selection is small and the cheapest bottle of wine is $45. I believe they really should have at least one or two less expensive options. Although not bad, the weakest dish was the Lardo Finocchio. To be honest, I'd give this place around 3.8/5 if I could be more precise considering the pricepoint and the service. Having said all this, overall it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... above average spot that has good service in a vibrant and fun space.  I like how they made a conscious effort to make a restaurant that isn't devoid of food, service, or atmosphere WHILE being family friendly.    Vibe is great... its a beautiful spot.  Comfortable banquettes line the walls while the nice fun and artistic details on the walls and chandeliers catch your eyes.  The dining area is spacious and open to the kitchen.  The kitchen is a bit loud but not as loud as the overhead music.  I was still able to have a conversation but the music was probably a smidge louder than most kids are willing to tolerate while eating.  The young one at ours naturally raised her voice to talk over the music... Im surprised the restaurants down the street didnt hear her.  As for the table spacing... its moderately tight but no where as bad as other spots.  It still lots of spacing for a stroller or kids chair.  Service here is friendly and polished.  We werent waiting too long for anything and she did check in enough times to make sure everything was good.  Menus look like a newspaper and quite novel.  It does change often so dont always trust the online menu.  We had a fair number of changed dishes from what we first saw online.  Also, they have a kids menu that is very reasonable so bonus there.  Before going into the dishes, I do want to mention that the pricing and value is very fair compared to other restaurants in Toronto.  I know some people commented otherwise.  At first it seemed to be small tiny plates but after digging into the dishes, it wasn't the case.  With very rich meat sauces or plump cheese stuffed pasta, this was very filling.  We were left quite full.  Chopped Salad - This particular salad had a generous variety of salami, olives, goat cheese, fried brussel sprouts, dandelion, picked onions, and crispy polenta bites.  Nicely dressed with a vinaigrette, the smooth rich goat cheese was a nice creamy contrast to the lightly acidic crisp greens.  The size was good to share among the table.  Visually it was really nice to see all the colours but taste wise, I felt it was a bit one note.  Just some sourness or saltiness from some of the ingredients while others were quite mute in flavour (cheese and polenta bites). 3.5/5  Crispy Calamari - Served super hot and crispy, this was a solid dish that had tender calamari chopped up, breaded, and then fried with minimal speck of oil.  This was quite nice.  Definitely portioned to be easily shared for apps.  4/5  Ravioli Bolognese - I like how their pastas are offered in an appetizer or main size.  The ravioli are really quite big and completely stuffed with cheese.  At first glance, you dont think its a lot but when you take your first bite, you taste the bright tomato flavour and then a bit of the meatiness in the bolognese followed by a ton of cheese.  I think we took this home because we couldnt eat too much of this. 4/5  Veal Medallions - Tender veal hidden under arugula.  It looked like a salad at first.  Though I do think they cooked it well, I found this to be very mild in flavour... I didnt really taste much of the mint, lemon, or parmesean.  I felt it was a bit bland. 3/5  Brussels Fritti - Generous side dish of brussels sprouts that were fried quite extensively.  They weren't burnt but just on the edge... and I felt it was heavily salted.  Possibly too much.  I also didnt taste any of the lemon or the funk fro the Parmesan.  Eat this one a bit more quickly as it doesnt sit well over time.  3/5  Roasted Cauliflower - Another side dish that was served up hot but tame in flavour.  Supposedly it has cumin, chilli, garlic, and yogurt... though there was a bit of a smear off to one side, it was certainly not enough to cover the mild tasting cauliflower.  3/5  It's a cool and fun space that is family friendly... you don't see that often but I found the flavours missing compared to other restaurants of the same calibre.  Service was solid and no miss steps.  Maybe next time I get to come back, I should stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. The décor was stylish and the ambience was just right - dimly lit, cozy yet classy, and not too loud.   Starting with cocktails, $13, I had the Menta Rosa and my friend got the Jalisco Caldo. Both refreshing and had a nice kick to it.   Smoked Burrata, $19. Easily my favourite dish of the night. Delicious. The ingredients, taste, and texture all worked really well together.   Egg Yolk Raviolo, $24. Savoury and very unique - would recommend a try.   Veal Medallions, $29. Very ordinary and the veal was kind of tough. This was on the house as it took ages for our food (and everyone else's) to come out. Apparently there was an issue with humidity and the pizza dough.  The Spicy Sicilian, $22. Not bad but I personally found this too salty for my taste.  Judging from others' reviews, the waiting for food incident seems like a one-off. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pasta and pizza, you can't go wrong with anything here, really. The pasta is fresh and homemade with delicious sauces, reasonably priced with options for appetizer size (which I ate as my main course - plenty of food!) or main course size which I've never tried but I assume is fairly large. The garlic bread appetizer is very good.   The drinks are inventive - I tried the Jalisco (I think that was the name) which had an interesting mix of jalapeño with some sweetness - very delicious and would recommend.   Service was attentive no issues there.   Hard to get a reservation on Friday and Saturday nights so book in advance. I'm surprised this doesn't have at least 4 stars on yelp."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with some friends for special occasions, get togethers, and birthdays. The food is very well prepared and delicious. I have ordered various pasta and pizza dishes. I feel with the pasta dishes, some dishes you may feel the portion sizes are too small but with the pizza dishes...maybe it is all that bread, you will feel like it is just too much.   This is your usual Italian fare, but I feel what sets it apart is that everything tastes freshly made and the decor is very sophisticated and instagrammable if that is your thing. This is a good place to meet up with friends, have good food and wine, and be able to have a conversation with your friends without loud music blaring at you in the background.  Good vibes, good ambiance, good food."}
{"text":"Despite some negative reviews, I had high hopes for Piano Piano. Unfortunately our experience was a major let down. Here's why.  Service: poorly timed and inconsistent. First dish was practically dropped and dashed. It should have been the oysters on the half shell but instead we had no idea what it was and actually thought it was a complementary amuse bouche. After asking what it was we discovered it was the poorly named appetizer of gnocchi fritti. It looked like deep fried ravioli with some meat sauce covered in chopped endive. 20 minutes into our meal, the same dish was served to us again by a different server.   Food: let's just say we turned away the mistaken second order of gnocchi fritti. It was dry and over fried, the andouille sausage (what? There's andouille sausage in this???) was far too spicy and the chopped endive was just - wrong. Oysters (which should have been served first) were the most pathetic, withered up little Malpeques I've ever seen. And the accoutrement was nothing special. No horseradish in the entire restaurant apparently. Burrata cheese was pretty good. Pasta limone was plain and looked like it was ordered off the child's menu, but tasted okay.   Ambiance: tables are jammed together along the wall. My head kept hitting the canvas paintings on the wall behind me. Candles on the table would have been a nice touch. Decor somewhat tacky. The groups singing happy birthday certainly didn't elevate the sophistication of the place.   Other: hand dryers in bathroom didn't work.   I can understand that restaurants can have an off night and at times I'm willing to give it another chance. Not this time."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  Makes a great place to take clients for dinner.  Awesome vibe!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Cool location, great atmosphere, and even better food.  I am travelling on business, so I went alone and sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and helpful.  He helped me select the Sicilian Manhattan, which was outstanding.  My pasta dish, Canestri alla Vodka, was to al dente perfection and was unique and flavorful.  I will be back, next time with a group so I can sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly good Italian food and drink. Taste was 5/5, and the decor is pleasant and fitting of the mood.   My only issue was that the service and staff weren't up to par. From the greeters up front checking us in, to the ones who served our table, the attitude was pretty unpleasant. It took a pretty long time for the food to arrive, and it was difficult to get a servers attention if something was needed. They were no check ins on the table either to see how we were.   There's mostly couples and groups at this restaurant. I guess the slow service isn't so bad on a date, lots of time to chat.   Go for the taste, it's worth the trip, even if the staff aren't great."}
{"text":"I had walked by Piano Piano multiple times before trying it. The flowery paint on the outside walls and neat interior decoration didn't really peak my interest, but I decided to give it a shot after a friend's recommendation. I'm glad I did - it's anything but what I expected.   A friend and I shared the chopped salad (great) and calamari (good). We ordered the Pretty Woman pizza because it had anchovies, and we had just laughed about a Futurama episode where they eat pizza with anchovies. We liked the pizza! Gotta eat it with a fork and knife for sure. I found the food to be a bit heavy with the salt... that is my only complaint.  I had a \"firm handshake\" cocktail, which tastes very similar to an old fashioned because its whisky base and orange flavours. It was a solid drink, I'd order it again in a heartbeat. We sat at the bar, and our bartender knew his stuff and gave us amazing service! All in all, we enjoyed the food and our experience. Piano Piano seems like a great date spot to me. Delicious Italian food, very efficient service... just seems like you'd need to book ahead for a table. it was busy! I'm hoping to come back and try another pizza."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Wicked space too.   Chopped salad is amazing (trust). So was everything else we ate.   Have also had them through foodora."}
{"text":"Have I missed the food trend of charring toast and pizza beyond recognition? I don't know if it was just the pizza oven last night. But our toast came out only partly edible as 3/4 of it was burned to an absolute blackened crisp. Like not good burnt toast. Same with the pizza - crust totally inedible. Most joints do much better pizza. Caesar salad was decent but the one strip of pork belly is misleading and not very creative. The egg yolk ravioli was more like baby food and veg bland once the egg was slopped up with, you guessed it, burnt bread!Definitely skip the banana cake - stale and pointless. Good ice-cream though. Fior di latte starter was yum! But we weren't able to enjoy it as much due to as above mentioned burnt toast. Another Toronto joint/menu where the hype overshadows the reality."}
{"text":"Come hungry my friends.  Big home style (if your home is Italy and your grandmother is cooking) portions of fresh and fast food await.  Start with a cocktail.  Then get into the grilled Caesar Salad (it is capitalized out of respect!), then move on to a main.  The spaghetti with meatballs is foolish and the steak is something else.  Great staff, big room, happy people.  Yes please."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Place, decoration and vibe are cool. Although when we arrived there was a couple \"closing a deal\" right before he reception of the restaurant and it was supper awkward to interrupt their moment.  Menu is meant to be cool, but has a lot of meaningless distractors that makes hard to find where the food is. Food is not surprising.  Gnocchi fritti is purely fried dough, it was so disappointing that we ate barely half of the dish, and it was not charged in our bill.  The veal was really badly cooked, raw in the middle to the point that we were not able to cut it, it was not medium rare, it was raw (a very common kitchen beginners mistake when cooking high profile meats).  About the Truffle scented mushroom cavatelli, the pasta was perfectly cooked and well done but ruined by a sauce that tasted like a very common and cheap fungi-porcini-cheese that anyone with a little bit of cooking knowledge is able to do. Side of cauliflower, once again, no surprises, just cauliflower and garlic.  For an obvious reason we didn't order deserts. And what I hate the most, more than paying for poor food: the waitress standing in the shoulder of my boyfriend while he was paying looking for how much he was tipping."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Piano Piano and can't say enough good about my experience.     We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Many of us already knew what we wanted because we had the chance to peruse the menu online.   In a nutshell, everything is delicious!   We were all thrilled with our choices...my husband dined on the charcuterie platter alongside with others at our table (it's large and made for sharing), for his main he had the bone in veal which was out of this world.  I did not have a starter just the red snapper which exceeded my taste buds expectations.   So delish!   I did not give Piano Piano five stars because it took what seemed like an eternity to get our main dishes.    Maybe that's what the meant...eat slowly, space your dishes apart so as to enjoy?    Not sure.  That aside, our server was phenomal and super attentive."}
{"text":"This place is so beautiful and cozy. It is perfect for family or friends meeting and gathering. The pasta is very delicious and tasty, full of the taste of its each sauce and flavour. The veal is as three times big as what I expected! It worths the price so much because it is way more than what I imagined. We ordered chocolate truffles as dessert but unfortunately they ran out the truffles so we replace it with a slice of lemon cheesecake withou any extra charges!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I came here for my birthday with high expectations. While Piano Piano has the look of a five star restaurant, it clearly is not.   The overall vibe of the restaurant is very off beat, quirky, and family friendly, a direct contrast to the very romantic and understated Splendido (same location, same owner). Victor Barry has done a good job of creating a restaurant that will appeal to guests of all ages with a simple pared down menu that features classic Italian dishes but the flavors are simply not there or off-balanced.   We ordered the highly recommended Chopped Salad because of it's interesting combination of ingredients (salami, polenta, and dandelion?) and although it was unique and ambitious, the flavors didn't gel well together and we found the cubed salami far too spicy and overpowering.   For our mains we ordered Ravioli con Bolognese, Egg Yolk Raviolo, Spaghetti Vongole, and The Fun Guy pizza (a fun play on words for mushroom lovers).   The pizza, upon arriving, was completely burnt black at the bottom. When we told the waiter he said they would replace it but also claimed that it should be burnt since they use a wood oven pizza. I've been to plenty of restaurants that use a wood-fired oven to cook pizza but it should never come out with the base completely burnt. The replacement was far better but had a strange texture as if the dough was still slightly raw.   The Ravioli con Bolognese and Spaghetti Vongole were okay. Hearty but nothing extraordinary. The best dish, by far, was the Egg Yolk Raviolo. The brown butter added a bit of sweetness to the dish, but there was just a bit too much salt that ruined an otherwise solid and well-balanced dish.   For dessert we ordered a Soft Serve Sundae that lacked some of the ingredients listed on the menu. The ice cream itself tasted super sweet and artificial.   Otherwise a bit disappointing. I have nothing against doing a menu with simple dishes but I would expect them all to be executed well, especially for paying such an expensive amount."}
{"text":"My husband and I only went there for drinks as it looked pretty from the outside and the decor enticed us to come in. Immediately we were met by snooty hostess who had to go check if there were tables in the dining room regardless of the fact there was one other couple only in the entire restaurant. The waiter went out of his way to present the menu and the specials which was nice but but when we told him we were there just for the drinks, he got visibly upset and made sure not to show up afterwards until we asked for the bill.   Granted, we haven't had the food and the pizzas looked delicious, the overall level of snooty-ness was too high and since we live in the village - I'm sure there are better casual Italian eateries around so we probably won't venture out to Piano Piano purposely."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Nice and cozy feel Nice, authentic Italian food. The service was excellent. Jeff was amazing. Don't forget to say hello to him when you are there ."}
