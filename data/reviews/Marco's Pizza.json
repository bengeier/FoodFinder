{"text":"this is our go to pizza joint for Friday dinner and movie.  haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"We have been to them a few times since there isn't much around here. However, the last two times they've messed up our order. The first time they forgot about us- literally. It was busy but after everyone else picking up including the people behind me  were served I asked where my pizza was, they couldn't figure it out, though I had ordered and they'd taken my money. 45 minutes and some very hungry kids later we had the order. They told us they'd put a credit on our account for next time. The next time we called there was no credit, but they honored it anyway. All would be forgiven except they screwed up the order. We asked for half cheese half pepperoni. It came out all pepperoni but half had two different kinds. They screwed up again, and somehow we ended up with 3 pizzas that night ( they apologized and offered the mistakes). We were happy accept the mistakes, but it would be preferable to simply order and get what you want the first time. The pizza itself is not consistently made, sometimes it's better than other times. Once when we ordered ( pre order mix ups) the sauce was almost sweet and there was way too much, it didn't even taste like their normal sauce. After the order mix ups we won't be going back it's just not worth the extra time and aggravation, we could drive further and still get home sooner with the correct order and better pizza."}
{"text":"2 hours for a pizza? When you quote 1-1 1/2 hours that's one thing, but then take over 2 hours? Continuous problems with super slow delivery, wrong pop, no pop, forgetting sauces. We're definitely finding another place to order from after months of terrible service."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for some time as I pass by it daily to go to work and come home. I finally got to order a large pepperoni pizza yesterday, which they had a $9.99 special. Overall, it is was ok, but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon.

The pros:
-The place looked cleaned.
-The cheese on the pizza was of quality.

The cons:
-It was too greasy. I mean, I know pizza is supposed to be greasy, but not overly soaked in grease that you can't taste the sauce. (See picture)
-The Roma Crust was a little too salty 

All in all, it is good to have a pizza joint close by, but I still have other pizza spots that I enjoy more that have better priced specials during the week.
I gave it 4 stars because the staff is friendly, it did just open, and the pizza wasn't a waste. But bring your patience like me, as of course, they are training staff so it may take them some time to know how to work the cash registers."}
{"text":"This pizza tastes better than my favorite pizza in Cincinnati.  My mouth waters just thinking about it!  The cheese they use tastes fresh as well as the wonderful sauce."}
{"text":"This is not your ordinary pizza place. They make their dough fresh every day put lots of toppings on their pizzas and have a very friendly staff. My delivery also got to me much quicker than I was expecting. If you haven't tried this before you need to try it."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place BT the manager Blake is very rude and shouldn't hold the position that he does..... He spoke to my mother completely rude then told her her pizza was cold because its been in the car for two hours..... What person of position like that speaks to their customers like such.... I'll never go back"}
{"text":"Would have have given a 5 star review but the delivery driver blew the horn in the driveway instead of bringing the pizza to the door. It was well after 12a.m! The pizza itself was very good and hot. I just have a problem with the lazy delivery driver."}
{"text":"ordered pizza from this place before and it was not so bad until today, had two large pizza's deivered to my home and what a dissapointment, both pizzas are over cooked  on top, cant even taste the cheese, I am adding more mozzarella on my own to make it taste better, even the $5 caesar's pizza is not this bad. very dissapointed"}
{"text":"I love this places, great tasting pizza, awesome service, really clean, everyone is always nice, always get hot pizza and the best cheesy bread you could ever get."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service at this location and the pizza is really good. Our first time sampling their menu and I was not disappointed. They were fast getting our order out because the team was prepared and ready to go! Will order there again in the near future. 
Thank you from Goodfellow Movers."}
{"text":"First time ordering.  Pizza was barely warm and we are 5 minutes away barely. Ordered thin crust. A little dry and could use more cheese. Will not order again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Dominos serves an uncooked zah, Hut still adds extra grease and never grts an order right. This place, in 5 orders has been spot on..... and on time."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and salad from this place and the experience was terrible!!!!!! The delivery drive had music so loud in the car and came to my door with a cigarette in their hand. Needless to say, the order was wrong and I was told that my was order was not wrong by person on the phone. Total rip off !!!!"}
{"text":"We hadn't ordered a pizza for carryout in two years and decided to try Marco's since I didn't feel like cooking or throwing a pie in the oven.  So glad we did!  Much better than DiGiorno!  Tasted great and the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Their pizza is very good when hot, but don't consider reheating it.  Not sure how it makes this transformation but next day it's purely styrofoam."}
{"text":"For a delivery style pizza restaurant, this place is top of the line. Every time I order form here I am impressed at the quality of food I am delivered. The pizza is much better than those main street chains and aside from the prices other places don't even compare."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, I have always received great service and I live that you can get a movie from the neighboring video store delivered with your pizza"}
{"text":"This location no longer exists. The listed phone number is for the 24335 Chagrin store."}
{"text":"Ordered tonight. We were highly disappointed. Better off at little Caesars. Pizza is like cardboard and the wings were microwaved."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up my order and it didn't come from the website apparently. After calling the other store to see if my order was there, I was told they didn't have my order. I showed the manager the email but the order was lost. I asked for a discount due to my inconvenience in which I was told I was getting a special........ copy. Make sure not to order here again."}
{"text":"Fast delivery!! Love the white cheesy!! I usually sub banana peppers for the tomatoes.... Get on their mailing list and they'll send you awesome coupons I.e $10 off $20."}
{"text":"I don't understand reviewers like the lady below (FG?) who orders from this place, and then complains about the price? Like, you have a choice in what you eat for dinner, lady. The prices are written directly on the menu. No shocker there. If it's too expensive, get yourself to the grocery store and make yourself a cheap affordable meal. Then have fun reviewing yourself. 

I happen to think Marco's is excellent, and worth the money. Service is fantastic. If you want pizza in Vegas, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fast delivery! Also love their website!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but pricey! Easy ordering online & easy access to location. Food taste fresh & I never feel that fat feeling after eating it. Service is quick. Definitely recommended for that Italian NY style pizza/food. We have tried multiple locations of other pizza places & by far enjoy Marcos the best."}
{"text":"I like the online ordering and is comparable to Papa John's, which is what I normal order. While I did arrive 15 minutes before I asked my carryout order to be ready, my order was not on time and I had to ask for part of my order. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow super cheesy pizza this place is awesome I'm never eating another pizza in my life!"}
{"text":"More expensive than Pizza Hut but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend the Chicken Florentine specialty pizza."}
{"text":"This place is obviously not very busy. The guy at the register seemed bothered by our presence..(we were he only ones in the place). We ordered while holding our infant, and only when we asked for a high chair did he tell us they don't have one! They also don't have a changing station in the bathroom! Needless to say we left hungry, but ended up having the best pizza of our lives across the street at Rosario's."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine for takeout or delivery. The Pepperoni Magnifico is out of this world. Terrific crust and tons of flavor. Reliably quick delivery (we live 1/2 mile away) and consistent quality."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery last week, and it never showed up. I called down there after an hour and a half, and they said I never placed an order. I checked my account, and they charged my card. I told them to find out what happened, and they insisted that I never placed an order. The next day my wife went to their location to show them the transaction, then they all of the sudden found the order. They said the order was cancelled 15 minutes after the order was placed. They blamed it on a new driver, like that had anything to do with it. The manager did nothing to refund my money, or to offer a comp for the mistake. VERY DISORGANIZED!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In love with this pizza!!!! Seriously the best delivery pizza I've ever had. My husband hates tomatoes or anything related to them, and most pizza places have nasty white sauce pizzas, but not Marco's! Try the White Cheesy pizza! You won't regret it! Our families love it so much that they want to order it every time they come to visit. My parents have even ordered on their way out of town to take a box back home to AZ for my younger siblings. Obsessed."}
{"text":"We've had our second delivery order today, so I thought I would write a review now. We've had a lot of trouble with decent pizza delivery - our local Domino's is a total disaster and Pizza Hut has steadily declined in quality. I tried Marco's on a whim, after I saw a delivery car in our neighborhood. Both times, we have ordered a pan pizza with the garlic butter crust with extra cheese, pineapple, and mushrooms. The delivery was slower the first time, but 35 minutes the second. The pizza itself - while not at all healthy - reminded me of old school Pizza Hut, back when their pan crust was buttery and savory. For chain delivery pizza, Marco's is very good."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the better places for a pizza in Brunswick but not anymore.  Pizza is greasy and sloppily made.  Half the time they don't pay attention to what you order and you can thank your lucky stars if it's not undercooked or burned. I don't know if the management has changed or they simply don't care anymore.  After more than ten years as a steady customer, it's time to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have had three mediocre pizzas from Marco's.  The pizza has way too much sauce on it and they over cook the cheese. The wait for a dine in order takes way too long. On two occasions I waited over 30 minutes for a pizza and it wasn't during a busy time. I would recommend Dominos or Papa Johns over Marco's Pizza."}
{"text":"Ever since Marco's took over the location from Caesars I've been eating only Marco's when I want pizza. I'll just keep this review simple, the pizza is delicious. My family and friends loves it. They're not at all stingy on the toppings and the quality of the overall product is very satisfying. We love the wings! We never order without getting wings. Delivery never takes too long either, plus I love that I'm able to use their live progress tracking that lets you know the order is taken, the order is being prepared and finally the order has left the building and is on its way. Love this! We have several pizza joints here in Steele Creek. Marco's is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"The order taker on the phone was polite and patient. The delivery was on time and prompt.  The pizza was not bad but to me did not stand out compared to other pizzas places in our area we can order from.  We ordered four pizzas and cheese bread for a working lunch at the office.  Some pizzas were better than others.  The crust seemed undercooked but what got me was the cheese bread. Literally no cheese, was a box of bread.  I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"The Henderson location on Stephanie is easy to get to and the staff are always friendly. If you want a pizza from a major(ish) chain, than Marco's is the place to go. They don't have the gimmicks of the other chains. Just really great crust and awesome ingredients. Their old-world pepperoni is really flavorful, and if I don't order a specialty pizza, I always add this topping. But their specialty pizzas are my go-to pizzas--especially their Pizza Magnifico and their White Cheezy. Both are so, so robust--and I never get that queasy feeling from eating too much salted grease. Marco's is the poo when it comes to chain pizza. The best crust, the best sauce, and the very best pepperoni of all of 'em. I love pizza, and don't mind spending $$$ for a chef-made pizza with gourmet toppings on an artisan crust. But sometimes I crave a straight-up \"fast food\" chain pizza. And Marco's is the best one of those."}
{"text":"Average sauce and crust.  Sausage was not tasty, pepperoni was pretty good.  This pizza is a little better than dominoes pizza.  Fast delivery."}
{"text":"I know it's a franchise but, easily my favorite franchise in Lakewood,  and still 2nd or 3rd when you include the mom & pop shops.
   The pizza is always fresh and delicious, wings are pretty good too. The salads, garden and greek are my favorites, are better than you make at home! What put me over the top today was as follows....
    I placed an order for pizza and salad, when I arrived to pick them up they told me it would be a few minutes as the salads were not finished. I thought it a little strange that the pizza was ready but we were waiting on salad? But, I said ok and took a seat...next thing I know they tell me they are adjusting my bill and apologizing for the wait. I said its fine and I appreciate it but what happened? I was told that they ran out of croutons and had to make more fresh...they actually make their croutons!! They don't come from a bag or box!! On top of that, they packed said croutons separate from the salad as they were still warm. All with smiles and kindness...
Rock on Marcos!!"}
{"text":"Came in super late and they are open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. I ordered deep dish with pepperoni,mushrooms, and sausage and it was good!.I really love the cinnasquares! Thomas the owner is really nice and friendly. The whole place is super clean. They have eating area and restroom. I will go back and try their chicken wings and subs."}
{"text":"Since my neighbor told us about Marco's Pizza we've tried it, loved it, and haven't eaten any other brand. Well our last order was more than we anticipated. When my daughter split two slices apart to eat one a greasy dead fly fell from between the two slices. I called Marco's spoke with a manager who stated he saw the order in the system and would credit the Marco's account. Well..... As we attempted to order Pizza tonight not only is the Credit not there they are saying it's nothing they can do about it now. 

Never again will I eat Marco's Pizza. 

Terrible customer service if you ask me."}
{"text":"This is a family owned spot. People are friendly and management is passionate about pizza. Always taste the love in whatever I order. Thank you."}
{"text":"Have been getting pizza here since they first opened and loved it.  But the last few times the pizza has been horrible!  They uses to put lots of ingredients on but have started to skimp on them and the flavor/taste just not as good.  We have stop getting their pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza so far is their pepperoni but its so good I keep reordering it! Never had a bad pizza from here! The dough is amazing I love pizza but only good pizza and there is a huge difference! A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! My hubby and I are in love with this pizza and can't go anywhere else in town. Love all pizzas and wings and salads.. Serious quality food here. Omg I need to place an order right now.. I'm craving a salad. Just thinking of that place makes me drool. Lol Chow!))))"}
{"text":"Nice, hot pizza and fast delivery. Ordering online was s breeze and you can even track the status of your order online."}
{"text":"Add extra sauce and get with baby pepperoni. Also new Parmesan crust topper was good as well"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  Don't waste your money. This pizza is nasty. I posted a picture of the greasy, disgusting pizza they delivered. It's gross."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, Staff is really nice. Fast delivery"}
{"text":"Good pizza for the price. Fast delivery and good quality. Marco's has become our new regular pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Today will be the last day that I ever order from Marco's. This was the last straw. The last time I ordered - we're not going to talk about today's incident just yet - I ordered a pizza, breadsticks and a 2L bottle of soda. Everything came but the soda, I called the store and complained, they apologized and said they'll be right out - this was after they told us to come and pick it up. If we had a vehicle and if it wasn't a predominantly white suburb, I wouldn't have had a problem with picking it up, but THEY forgot, it was THEIR responsibility. Suffice it to say, they never showed up so they pretty much got tipped twice. This second incident, I order and I waited way past the 45-minute window for when the order will get here and NO CALL. I had to call them, come to find out, they ran out of cheese. They didn't even bother to call me and tell me! They just had me sitting here waiting. They already had my money, but they somehow forgot to call and tell me they ran out of cheese. I'll never do business with you again!"}
{"text":"Revisited Marco's pizza for a carry out order. The service was friendly and helpful!!Unfortunately, while ordering, some kitchen staff were sitting on the counters near the cutting board and chatting away. The manager or supervisor need to be more strict with the kitchen staff about cleanliness."}
{"text":"The pizza was good and my kid's loved it. The service from the manager was exceptional. She made sure we had everything we needed and checked on is twice."}
{"text":"My high marks are for a takeout order placed on a Friday afternoon around 3pm. In short, excellent quality and ingredients, fast, friendly service. Very tasty -- better than anywhere else I've been in SW Las Vegas for pizza. Thank you, Marco's!"}
{"text":"My family has been thoroughly pleased with Marco's in the past, even suggesting it to others because of the experiences we've had, until today. We order delivery from them quite frequently, the last time being 2 weeks ago for a birthday party, but then 01/26 we called to place a delivery order only to be informed that we're out of their delivery area and after checking with a manager said they \"In the past may not have been as busy or had more drivers available but weren't going to deliver to us\". That's not how you run a business in the hospitality industry. Pizza Hut didn't have a problem taking our money. See ya Marco's"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever.  I ordered my pizza online at 650pm.  It said pickup at 705.  I arrived at 710 and paid and they said it wasn't ready yet.  Since then I have asked several more times to no avail.  I also signed up for yelp and posted this review while still waiting.  It is now 745.  55 minutes for a cheese pizza!  Even if it's the best pizza I've ever had (which I'm sure it won't be), I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I have always received great food,  and service. I had an issue with my order not going through on the website.  I called the store,  and spoke to Isacc. He found my order, and informed me it was on it's way.  He was so helpful, and nice.  Shortly after Cesar arrived with our food.  Delicious as always!! Marco's Pizza on Warm Springs is amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering online Delivery from this particular Marco's in Gastonia for a little over a year now, and almost every time the food has been delivered a little earlier than told.  Love that!  Especially when you're starving!  Lol.  The drivers have always been friendly and polite too, and well-deserving of a tip!  

We've had the pizza (several kinds) and have loved them, with each one coming to us hot and cheesy, with plentiful toppings and a sauce that is absolutely delicious!  No matter what type of crust we've ordered, we haven't come across a bad one yet.  Nothing soggy, nothing burnt.  Plus, their crust actually has FLAVOR, unlike some places where the crust is more like cardboard for all the taste you get.    

You can tell that these pizzas are made with an eye to pleasing the customer.  They don't skimp on the toppings.  After trying a Marco's pizza, you'll probably never order a \"chain\" pizza again!  Also, don't bother ordering extra cheese because the \"regular\" amount is plenty for even a cheese fanatic like me.

Marco's also has chicken wings which are a decent size and very tasty.  I love the Bar-b-que sauced ones, myself. 

Their sandwiches are great too but my husband and I keep coming back to the Meatball and the Turkey Bacon Club!  Their Meatball sub is well worth trying because the meatballs, cheese and sauce taste great!   Plus they really fill the roll.  No \"eight meatballs only\" on this treat! 

And the Turkey Bacon Club...toasted...is almost to die for.  :)    One especially nice touch that I like is if they can't put everything you want on the sandwich, they'll wrap the item(s) in aluminum foil, sending everything along for you to put on.  (Sometimes I do get a bit carried away with what I want on my sandwich.  Lol.) 

If you're into salads, keep one thing in mind:  their LARGE salads are big enough for TWO people to eat.  My husband and I usually always order one large Garden Salad along with our pizza or subs, and we've never been disappointed with the freshness of all the vegetables in this.  Delicious! 

Also, we ALWAYS order their cheesy bread sticks...soft, never burnt, and lots of flavor!   :) 

The ONLY thing we DON'T like from Marco's is the brand of Ranch Dressing that they send along...lousy sour taste and very watery.  Do yourself a favor and use your OWN Ranch Dressing.  You'll be happier for it!"}
{"text":"Had Marco's for dinner last night and I was beyond satisfied!  We were promptly  serviced and the pizza was delicious! It looked better than the picture and it was the best pizza I have ever tasted! Pleasanlty surprised and Jason M. was really great with his customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is b.s. They sent me a $10 gift certificate welcoming me to the area, but when I went to use it, they wouldn't honor it with their so called \"special\" and charged me 3.00 more then I was told. Really?!?! I also ordered it for pickup, they said 20 minutes I had an errand to run first and got there 30 minutes later and still had to wait 5-7 minutes for it to be ready. This is one new customer they won't be getting back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Chicken tenders...not that great.  Will  order pizza from here again in a heartbeat, but that is probably it...and a soda."}
{"text":"Good pizza and it's cheap and I like the chicken nuggets they are really good and the subs are decent"}
{"text":"What?! Haven't tried it yet? You're missing out. 

We are First Timers for Marco Pizza! Will definitely be a second time. 
We ordered the Deluxe with green olives. OMGosh! So delish. I even ate the crust!  I normally just toss the crust or give it to my husband. But it was actually really delicious so I ate it.  Lots of toppings no skimping . 
I'm looking forward to trying their other pizzas. If you like Deluxe gotta try it. 
Service was fast, and the delivery guy was super nice. Since we ordered over $10 we got a free movie to rent."}
{"text":"Brand new place, so appearance is nice. Friendly and helpful staff. Easy to navigate menu with choices from pizza, subs, salads and sides. Today I had a meatball sub. Edible, bit not exciting at all. Meatballs appear to be premade and frozen off site. The bread was decent. The sub could have had a little more sauce, but it wasn't dry. Cheese was very good. I may return at some point and give the pizza a try."}
{"text":"Every time I give this place another chance I realize why I said never again 6 months prior. Bad service and mediocre pizza make for a horrible pairing. It's a shame there aren't any other halfway decent places that deliver in the southwest part of town:"}
{"text":"Just spent 10 minutes fighting gloriously with their website to apply my coupon only to learn after the order was completed it was not applied.   Given we have more pizza joints than gas stations I'll mark this one done and move on."}
{"text":"Not great, I would have preferred a frozen pizza instead. Super greasy, not a crispy crust. RUN to Grimaldi's instead!!"}
{"text":"Below average - way below.  We ordered two pizza's and chicken wings.  A frozen pizza would have been better and the wings were under cooked.

The crust must have been frozen -  and the sausage had a very distinctive  taste and not in a good way.

First and last time we will be be ordering Marco's pizza."}
{"text":"I love the pepperoni  magnifico! 
I always order it when I have company over to watch a movie or sporting event.
I hope this franchise spreads to other cities!"}
{"text":"My brother is a delivery guy there and he brought us pizza and their cheesy bread. It was all awesome! The crust is so good. I hear great things about the customer service as well. They also have a wide delivery range."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a try, but was very disappointed.  We got a pepperoni pizza and it was so greasy that I couldn't even eat it.  The cheesy bread wasn't even cooked through and tasted bad.  If you want quick pizza delivery in this area, toppers is way way better, and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza, timely service, and very reasonable prices. Their website is also super easy to use and makes it easy to add a variety of toppings. Our favorite go to on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good customer service, prompt delivery but a bit pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and the pizza here is good, it's crispy, soft, and very tasty, so overall the pizza i give 5 stars. On the other hand the service is \"eehh\" it was not too inviting to walk into, it felt very gloomy and uncomfortable, I wasn't even greeted until I actually came up to order, the workers looked like walkers, it seemed they didn't wanna be there, most of the time they were just talking in the kitchen. Even the Manager (I assume) was talking to other people the whole time not even greeting a lot of customers, he was basically talking nonsense for a good 10 minutes, for example he was talking about how great his business was and how he (supposedly) is beating multiple pizza chains in freshness, when some of his ingredients in the pizzas are canned, so it's very contradicting if you ask me, and that's not even the worst part, one of the workers was on the phone (very very loudly, P.s. the place isn't that big) so he's talking about business on the phone, in the restaurant, walking back and forth, doing nothing...If your gonna do that, atleast do it outside. So yes I'm giving the service a 1 star due to lack of workmanship, lack of attention to ALL customers, and lack of comfortability of environment, but the Pizza is a good 5 stars, but service is not 5 star quality yet."}
{"text":"Always ready and reasonable, No time spent waiting. And while it's not overwhelmingly impressive the order is always right and I know what to expect. Friendly service goes a long way as well. I always do carry out."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, wings and cheese sticks, really good pizza crust with the parm on it, gonna have try some the other menu items eventually but kinda with how good the pizza is."}
{"text":"I love their chicken wings!! They're the best I've ever had!! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent. I ordered a pepperoni pizza. The customer service was awesome as well. The guy that was fielding the calls, Reggie, was very kind on the phone as well as when I went to pick it up. He even reminded me of their garlic sauce for the crust. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best pizza place in Mentor! Their pizza is so delicious that the smell alone is enough to make you drool! The cheesy bread is soft and cheesy and just goodness. The pizza is good for leftovers and the next day. The service and staff is very friendly. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Delivered the wrong pizza to me.  Didn't have my phone but i was under the influence and didn't care that it was the wrong pizza.  They called my phone two times and finally went out of their way to delivery me my Hawaiian pizza.  That my friend is what America is built on.  God bless."}
{"text":"I've had this experience a few places in Charlotte, so it may be the norm here, but I hate pizza where the cheese is still white, just barely melted.  I'm used to thoroughly baked golden brown cheese, not soft white mush."}
{"text":"I've driven past this Marco's location quite often and have always wondered how it compared to the other chain pizzas. Tonight I decided to give it a try. I checked their website to have a look at the menu, and placed an order: an XL Pepperoni Magnifico (I love Old World pepperoni and not too many places have it) and a large cheese for the kids. The pick-up time was a very reasonable 20 minutes. 

Upon pick-up, the employee at the counter (he was one of the drivers) presented the pizzas so I can be sure I received what I had ordered. The cheese pizza looked great, however, the pepperoni pizza had the olives on it that I ordered, but not the pepperoni. I mentioned this to the person at the counter and he immediately offered to remake my pizza, and even insisted that I take the incorrectly made one as well. He offered this all with a smile, wanting to make it right. He quickly made the new pizza and got it in the oven. One of the other employees even offered to put the pizzas that were ready back under the heat lamps so they'd be kept hot; very professional gesture. The correct pizza was out of the oven quickly, boxed up, and I was on my way home to a very hungry family. 

Apparently, what I ordered did not translate properly from the website to the store. I was informed that I should just call the order in next time to ensure accuracy, which I will do. 

I was worried that the 10 minute drive home would yield the two ready-made pizzas would need to be reheated (I hate reheating pizza). To my surprise those two were just as hot and fresh as the pepperoni that went from the oven, to the box, to my hands! And the taste......this is the best chain type pizza I've had. The crust was delicious, the toppings were fresh, the cheese tasted real and had a great flavor. All in all, it was a great experience. I will definitely return to this Marco's location

Great pizza. Even better staff."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time tonight & was so delicious! And the delivery was quick. Love it :)"}
{"text":"I always order from this location and usually I don't have a problem. A week ago I ordered and one of the questions they ask is if I want delivery or carry out. I said delivery. Over an hour later, I decided to call and ask them what was taking so long. Long story short a manager took my order and put it under carry out. If she was not in a rush to take the order, this problem could have been avoided. She didn't even bother talking to me herself, she had someone else on the phone. I never call and complain, and usually I see when people do, something is taken care of. Nothing. She just told me she could have my order sent out. I said no because I was afraid they might do something to my food. Do not order from this location. They take forever. I am never going to order pizza from this Marcos again."}
{"text":"I only use this location if I get a coupon in the mail, because I find the pizzas to expensive if it wasnt for the buy one get one free deals etc. Anyway, I used to love this pizza place when I have ordered from this location I believe about 2-3 years ago for the first time. Over the years I have noticed I dont love their pizzas as much as I used to, since their quality is going down. 
I will only order from this location if get their offers in the mail. Other wise I wont be going out of my way to order here."}
{"text":"So glad that Marco's pizza just opened near me! I've gotten delivery twice since the new location opened. I ordered online which was extremely easy. After placing my order I was able to view a tracker to see the status of my order. The first time I ordered the delivery came a few minutes early. The most recent time my order was delivered in less Jan 30 minutes! The food is great, especially for the price. The pizza is always fresh and tastes like they use real ingredients. Definitely my new neighborhood pizza spot!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!
We called to order delivery.  The person who answered the phone, a woman with a Southern accent, just answered and snapped, \"Hold!\"  Meanwhile, she continued taking orders from people on other lines WHILE I HEARD EVERY ADDRESS, NAME, and CREDIT CARD NUMBER as she verified!!!  When she came back on the line to take my order and I politely mentioned to her what I had heard, she snapped again, \"I don't THINK so!  I NEVER repeat my clients' information over the phone.  What do you want?\"  She was RUDE and did not care to correct her sloppy practices therefore, I concluded that she does NOT care about her customers.  We did not order after all.

PS:  We have eaten IN the restaurant before and we were treated pleasantly (we were served by two gentlemen), but this place is NOT a safe option for credit card users who call for pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"Rude service and just mediocre pizza.  When I placed my order over the phone, the lady demanded my address even though I told her it was for pick-up.  She then rudely asked for the cross streets.  I gave her the cross streets and continued with her questions in a demanding voice.  When I went in to pick up the pizza there were about 5 employees and I was the only customer.  Another rude person came up and acted like I was inconveniencing her by picking up my order.  For the price they charge and the free attitude you receive, I'd definitely stay away from this place."}
{"text":"High quality pizza and great salads, especially for delivery! Top notch service every single time!"}
{"text":"My bank was charged mulitple times for one transaction. After inquiring about it to the owner Tim, he derogatory explained how \"pending charges\" work as if I had never used my debit card before. He had no consideration or empathy about any inconvenience. In addition he stated, \"I don't care about what your bank statement says. \" 

No one should trust this owners' business with any card transaction. 

For a mediocre pizza place, it would make business sense for the customer service to be better. 

I usually don't post reviews but when money for pizza is being over charged (100+), the bad customer experience had to be shared. I always support small businesses, however Tim made Pizza Hut, Dominoes, and Papa Johns look good."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I can't give zero stars. Had the single worst experience. Delivery driver was short not polite or seemed to not give a care. Dropped off pizza and had wrong/incomplete order then came back for payment without delivering compete order. Paid driver.  

Called the store only to have person tell us we didn't and refused pay for deliver. 

When we called they seemed annoyed regarding order and wanted to argue what was ordered. We preferred to cancel the remaining order based off he fact they didn't want our business."}
{"text":"So they messed up my order by adding white onion, instead of red onion!! They delivered both pizzas free of charge!! What a nice surprise!! Marcos Pizza  is a huge blessing to the Silverado!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than a one I would, how do you advertise delivery but don't have s disclaimer that you don't deliver at night in gated communities, what about people who don't have a car or a little one at home..... I'm not so much as upset about the fact they don't however I am upset my card was auth prior to and now I have to hope I get my money back, if not that's time out of my day to fight for it ..... Never again will I come here this was my first time and now my last time guess I'm stuck with papa johns ...... Very sad and disappointing"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! Very friendly staff. You are welcomed the moment you come in the door :) The lunch specials are great! The slice of pizza I had was awesome and the chicken bites were very flavorful and tender also! I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Terrible service.  The people were nice enough but couldn't seem to get my order to me.  Very unimpressed.   The food, once we got it, was very very good but it's not worth the effort.  Maybe delivery is better..."}
{"text":"We're from Buffalo & pretty picky when it comes to pizza. Marcos pizza was a pleasant surprise.  Crust was just right, sauce was on the sweet side, it was overall very good.  Delivery was right on time & delivery man was pleasant & very patient while we reined in our dogs.  Would definitely order from here again next time on our next trip here"}
{"text":"Marco's is right across the street from me, so I have ordered from multiple times. Its nothing great, but ain't bad either. If you normally like Pizza Hut and Domino's, you will probably like these guys a bit better.  If you're looking for East Coast style small family pizza place, this is not it, Its a bit of that pizza style produced for the masses, but a good job for what it is."}
{"text":"Great pizza, quick service, great hangover food.. and it won't break the bank.."}
{"text":"the Hawaiian pizza was really good. The place was super busy.  Would order again from this place."}
{"text":"Crust is awesome, good flavor in sauce too. Definitely recommend getting all the crust toppers. Pizza reheats great also, IF you have any left over."}
{"text":"We have worked with Marco's Pizza twice now on big catering orders. They were amazing! The pizza is always delicious (along with the cheese bread and cinnamon sticks) and the service was wonderful. I left a table back at our office and Joey the manager at this location brought a table for me and had a staff member help our crew hand out the pizza. All the pizza was on time and hot. We even ended up adding to our order and everything was handled beautifully. Thank you Marco's for your help. We really appreciate you and cannot wait to work with you again!"}
{"text":"Back again for another pizza from Marco's. I always order online and pick up in person. Always ready before the noted time. Pizza was very tasty (love the crust and sauce) and the toppings were plentiful. Marco's has been running a number of specials, which makes the experience even better! The restaurant look and cleanliness is appealing for those that want to eat locally."}
{"text":"We ordered a carry out pizza. The staff was friendly when we went to pick it up and the pizza was delicious. Will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Okay so I would give this place 5 stars because the pizza is great. The delivery is super fast. Except!!!!! Every time I order delivery, they always ALWAYS forget to give me my sauces!!! It's sooooooooooo frustrating and makes me not want to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Terrible took an hour and im around the corner, get the pizza looks like it sat in the damn car for an hr covered in grease and barely any cheese cold as shit. Drunk food, not dinner food"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this location we get great pizza! Today was probably the best of them all....hot and cheesy!!! Yessssss!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. Chicken fingers or whatever they call them not good at all. Will go back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizza...very friendly service. The old world style pepperoni is delicious a must have on your pizza in makes the difference."}
{"text":"I just ordered a pizza and cheesy bread my receipt had the numbers to get a free one   but then they told me I didn't have enough numbers but they only gave me   I think I will try  papa John's next time"}
{"text":"So I have ordered from here before and never had an issue. The past 2 online orders I placed where not right. The first one about 2 weeks ago didn't come at all after waiting an entire hour. I go online and though the payment confirmed they had no record of the order placed. 

This time I ordered a specialty pizza for 10.99 and a square deal (cheesy bread and 2litter), payed 18.00 for my order. I did think it was odd but let it go. I was brought my specialty pizza and a cheesy bread. I call them, no record of my order again. I ask and place an order again for the square deal, and he asks if I want the free cheesy bread with it (though I already have one) um... yes I paid for it, i don't care give me my damn order!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Usually quite good. Sometimes clumps of cornmeal in the pizza but not often. Carryout is what i recommend. 

I ordered delivery once when i was sick. The delivery man was quite shady. Parked very close to my door and kept truck running and was very loud. He forcefully asked to be let inside. And then rudely scoffed when i asked for a pen to sign the receipt. So i went a got a pen while shadytown was snoopin around my kitchen. I seriously think he was trying to jack something. I should have reported him to management but i dont think he works there anymore. (Wonder why?) Because of that experience i would not recommend delivery. 

But foodwise one of the best marcos in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! The pizza was fresh & delicious! We were given a generous amount of toppings. The prices are great. The store is neat and inviting. Employees are very friendly and proficient. They are open late and they deliver! This is the first time in a while that I have been this satisfied with trying out a new place. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ehh it's decent, not the best but not the worst. Get the sheet pizzas. They taste much better than the actual pies."}
{"text":"I just tried this last week in Texas and I have to say they have really good thin crust. I was so excited to see that Marco's was in Las Vegas too. The thin crust Is not soggy or dripping with grease. The flavor of the sauce is really good. 

If you order online and discover you are outside of heir delivery area, call them to see if they actually do deliver to your location. They also have a new website (according to their employee) and it's not very user friendly. It added extra cheese to one of my pizzas. The employees at this location were really friendly and helpful. 

Update: What that employe told me was lies. We are in the same zip code as them and they don't deliver. Also, I called and spoke a \"manager\" who was rude, didn't listen and would not give me their name, so they probably weren't a manager. Horrible customer service. I don't care how good their pizza is, I'm never buying it again because of how they treat their customers.  DON'T SUPPORT A COMPANY WHO HAS RUDE EMPLOYEES AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"I know the saying, any pizza is good pizza...but this place really is awesome! Not only do they make pizza exactly how you want it (extra sauce? light cheese? burnt to a crisp? they got it). All kinds of toppings to choose from and delicious cheesy bread to boot! 

To top it all off (see what I did there?) the service is stellar! The staff is always very pleasant and helpful on the phone, making sure you get the best deal. Also the coupons come fast and furious, whether you're an addict (present company included) or a once in a great while-er, they never forget about you! 

Love me some Marco's!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes!  I've been on a Charlotte pizza quest for some time, just trying to find the best.  Ok, I'm from CT where the New Haven pizza cannot be beat.  Well, on the East coast, maybe NYC and Boston have better, but just barely.  So, yes to Marco's!!!

The ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and the crust is worthy of eating every bite.  I've only tried the pepperoni (two types) and sausage (just the right spiciness) but perhaps I'll branch out after overdosing on my favorite combination.  Sauce is just perfect for me.  The aroma emanating from the delivery box as soon as you get near delights the senses.

Nice touch - the management team sends an email thanking you for your business (new kid on the block) and gives coupons.  Great pizza and great deal.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my house so I had to try it. I've been here a few times and my pizza has always been ready on time, correct and not burnt.  Good price for a good pizza, tastes similar to papa john's so I loved it! Worth a try"}
{"text":"Would give 0 star. Clerk did not return the correct change ($5) and said I was \"gipping\" her after I was still holding out my hand in front of her with the money she just gave. Needles to say, she did not return my money. Pizza was extremely cold after picking it up on time."}
{"text":"It was late night and we needed some pizza to feed our hungry crew that was helping us to unload our moving truck and after pulling up pizza places on my yelp app, we discovered Marco's which was the only place open until midnight.  The gentleman on the phone was very patient when taking my order and took time to tell me all of the specials and what they entailed and let me just tell you, coming from Maryland I would have gotten major attitude and maybe a dial tone, but I digress.  We ended up ordering an XL cheese, a pepperoni pizza and their Roma special pizza which has pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and bacon on it.  I also threw in some buffalo wings with bleu cheese and a soda. Mmmmmm, mmmm,mmmm, mmmm good!  Everyone loved the pizza!  It was hot, fresh, generous toppings, nice crust, good sauce and the wings were heavily sauced and good size. I do wish they were fried though because I like them that way but they put them through the oven a little longer to accommodate me. Prompt delivery, courteous driver and our bellies were full.

Now, what really makes me like this place is that my 7 year old son, who lives for pizza and could literally eat a whole pie by himself if you let him, for the first time ate and loved something other than cheese.  The following day we had a couple of slices of the Roma pizza left over, I was eating them, my son wanted pizza, I told him there was no cheese left, got him to try the Roma and let's just say that for two days straight, it was all he could talk about!  Tired of hearing him \"remind\" me of how good it was, I called and ordered him another one and it made his day.  I told the gentleman on the phone about this and he got a kick out of it, I think!  Any place that can get my very picky, limited diet son to eat some meat on a pizza, which he desperately needs because he's so skinny, is a place I will frequent often.  I plan to try a few more things on the menu and hope they are just as satisfying.  Marco's is what it is, It's not gourmet pizza  but it's a great local neighborhood pizza joint, if you ask me,  I'll be back.

That is all!"}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok, small size. 
They also gave us coupons on the box that have already expired."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to do a pick up and was surrounded by nothing but teenagers, so maybe my lack of a fifth star is ...misplaced? The young guy who was cashier turned around toward another female staff member and said \" What the hell is that? You call those bread sticks!\" while I was leaving. I'm not sure if he was joking or not but I certainly hope he was. 
  Otherwise, the food, as always, was awesome!"}
{"text":"IMHO, Marcos brand pizza is one of the best chains around. This particular location takes good care of their food and makes sure you get the delivery fast and hot. 

You can definitely get a high tab if you're customizing too much but you et what you pay for. 

Try ordering online."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, amazing price, amazing place, a must go. The old style pepperoni is the best. It's delicious on any style of pizza."}
{"text":"This is the most bomb pizza I've ever had in Las Vegas! I used to be a Papa Johns girl, however that era has ended. Marco's is my go to when I want pizza in this town. I personally love the thin crust!"}
{"text":"Marco's Pizza in Sheffield Village is so good, it amazes me every time we order one. They're BSD (big square deal) is our go to \"build your own\" because the surface area is larger than a 14\" Large round, so at $7.99 it's a great bargain. Very nice staff, and as busy as they are, I have rarely had to wait for my carry out."}
{"text":"Love their pizza.  Beats the Pappa John's any day.  Always cooked the way we like it (well done).  Love the garlic flavored crust."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza especially the Chicken Florentino it's just when I go there at night especially around 10pm, they're really in a rush to go home to where the chairs are already up on the tables. The guy doesn't give you a warm greeting and the staff verbally stress each other out. I think undercover boss should've went to this location instead. They can use a new night shift manager."}
{"text":"This may sound like a petty complaint but after numerous mistakes with my orders I have reached my breaking point. I moved into the neighborhood very near this Marco's location about 5 years ago. This is when I discovered Marco's for the first time. I really like the Big Square deal for the price so they became my \"go to\" pizza just for the price and convenience. I was a very regular customer. My complaint is I don't like the cheese sprinkles they put over the pizza so I would always just order it with the garlic flavoring on the crust. The other thing is in the past year or two I started ordering it as an 8-cut instead of 16 so there was more crust edge per slice. Neither of these are special requests, they are one of the options offered.  I can't tell you how many times in the last 2 years that it came with the sprinkles and incorrectly cut. I can safely say at the least, over 20 times it was wrong and this is no exaggeration. The most recent and final time was this week. I ordered it over the phone so I could make sure they understood what I wanted. I also picked it up instead of delivery so I could check it when I got there. There it was, 16 cut instead of 8! I mentioned it to the man at the counter, I said I would still take it but I let him know this was a constant mistake and they need to read the order correctly. (it specifically said 8 cut on the receipt). He was barely apologetic and I could tell he didn't see what the big deal (no pun intended) was about. I was a paying, repeat customer. That's the big deal! Also while this was going on, 3 or 4 other employees were just standing behind the counter talking about personal BS which is probably why no one can get a simple order correct! There are way too many great pizza places in Parma to waste one more dime at this place! I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"First impression:  very nice place.  Inside has good decor.  We were immediately greeted upon walking in, which was a good first impression.  

Being our first time, we ordered a medium pizza, wings, and cheese bread -- we wanted to try it all.  The wait for the food was long -- 45 minutes sitting inside the restaurant is a little unacceptable for a pizza.  The manager or possible pen was not and kept reassuring us our food would be next.  However, several people who ordered long after us were eating before us.  That's frustrating when u are hungry.  I'll update in the food if we ever get any.  

Food:  we got a specialty pizza...it was okay but nothing to write home about.  The chicken wings...small and mushy, wouldn't order again.  The cheese bread...doughy and hardly any cheese beside the center.  Also beware blue cheese dressing is water.  And the ranch says \"refrigerate for quality\" and its warm.  Who dropped that ball???  Both were gross!!  

My opinion -- I won't come back:  we wait over a hour for pizza.  2 other tables asked for their money back and left with no food who were here longer than us.  The owner/ manager excuse was \"we dropped the ball.\"  I get a new business and new adventures....but customer satisfaction  did not exist here.  Overall disappointme"}
{"text":"If I could've given this place zero stars I would have. I placed an order for pick up (6\" meatball sub and a small antipasto salad). When I called in I was told 20 minutes, we showed up in 10 and it was ready. The cashier couldn't even give proper change even though the register was telling her what it was. We took our food home and when I opened my sandwich it was the wrong one! Not only was it the wrong one but it was cold, couldn't imagine if I had waited the 20 minutes I was originally told.  I called back and told them I'd be returning with the wrong sandwich and to have the correct one ready. We get down there and they apologize and hand us our new sandwich. We make it home and guess what?! Wrong sandwich again! I am fuming at this point. I call them back and tell them what happened and I tell them this time they'll be delivering my sandwich and she tells me it'll be 40 minutes?! The manager offers to put a $5 credit on my phone number for my next order. They can keep that $5. The sandwich wasn't anything I'd go back for and the salad was so blah I could've made one better at home. Never again. Save your money and don't waste your time. This place really needs to get it together. They can start by smiling, greeting their customers, getting orders CORRECT, and they might wanna put their phone number on their to-go menus so you don't have to call another store to get it when trying to call an order in. 

This took place on 3/18/18 approx 7pm."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and the pizza is delicious.  Their special three cheese mix gives it a unique taste.  Had a vegetable only pizza  -  and loved it.  Service is friendly and fast.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Authentic italian my ass. I've seen dog food more authentic. Will never order from Marco's again"}
{"text":"Before we discovered Marco's, we thought we had to have the good pizza flown in from Oregon. We had tried multiple pizza places around the state looking for a great tasting pepperoni pizza. When we finally found Marco's we couldn't believe it; their specialty Pepperoni Magnifico is perfect with a great crust.

We love how easy it is to order online, up to and including picking a delivery/pickup time! The rewards program is awesome and easy to use and everyone is very friendly. The single time (out of many) our order had a mix up, it was made right straightaway and without issues. We continue to be incredibly happy with Marco's!"}
{"text":"This is our super doughy pizza we ordered. We called in to let Marco's know that we were upset about the pizza in hopes that they would fix it for the next person. Our second pizza was fine, they did not give us our second marinara sauce with our cheese sticks that didn't have much cheese on it. When we explained these things instead of helping us work through our issues we were told we had requested light cheese. The \"manager\" was short with us and gave no customer service. The fact of the matter is the pizza was under cooked. In regards to this we were told we could have a credit or come get a new pizza. With the service we received we will not be taking the credit or getting another pizza. We will not be back ever."}
{"text":"Very bad experience!!! Placed an online order for delivery at 9:40pm (they are open until 11pm), the estimated delivery time provided was 35 minutes. I received a confirmation email and my credit card was charged for the order. Over an hour later, at 10:40pm there was still no delivery. I called the store, they advised me they had no record of my order and that they couldn't do anything because there was no manager there. So...I was left hungry with my credit card charged and no solution. This was my first attempt to try Marco's pizza, guess it wasn't meant to be. Seems that if they truly didn't get my online order, their systems are not to be trusted, maybe call the order in instead. If they did receive my order and just failed to process it, then they should've admitted to the truth and handled the situation in a more professional manner. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Online ordering is great. Ordered in the morning for 5:15 pm pickup.  Walked in around 5:15 was told they made a mistake. I expected the worst.  Not only was the pizza ready, they gave me the pizza not made according to my order for free.  Great job exceeding my expectations.  Pizza as always was excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best in town by far!  Love this little
Pizza place.  It's been a few pizza places over the years but I'm sure Marco's is here to stay!  Great service and food!  We will be back weekly for sure!  Our new favorite spot for dinner on a budget and a rush! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We have a new favorite pizza place!!! We checked it out tonight and it was delicious! My son inhaled the hot wings and said he loved them.  I got a salad which had fresh ingredients and it was a huge portion.  I recommend sharing it with someone.  The cheesy bread was awesome.  Definitely check out their menu of specialty pizzas.  We were going to just order basic cheese but the staff recommended to try out the \"white cheezy\" which I'm glad we did.  They also have a variety of crusts and toppings.  We sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather. We will be back again very soon! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First got this pizza when they ordered at work. I really like it. On the greasy side for sure but good cheese pizza. Semi new york style. Not flat enough for that but it is good pizza. Pepperoni one is way too greasy though pizza looks orange"}
{"text":"So we go here often, so often they now know our pizza. It kinda stands out since it is gluten free. The owner understands and trains his staff to know how important it is to make sure that there is not cross contamination with their typical pizzas. They have never made us sick but this gluten free pizza is gooooood. With most national pizza chains carrying a gluten free option there really is comparison this is the best gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was ready when I came to pick up.  Still hot and was very tasty.  Kudos to all the staff!  Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Eh! Well when this place first opened I was excited that Mount Holly had a pizza joint that was not Domino's or Papa Johns.  My first pie from here was just okay.  It was a little too greasy for my liking. I gave it 3 stars because I like the crust options they give you and because it is not Papa Johns or Domino's.  It is a little better quality then most chains.  Staff is friendly and Family Video gives you great deals on pies.  They also include rental deals as well.  What would be a great asset to this place since it is co owned and operated by Family Video is if they offered a video delivery option for those with memberships to the video store.  That would give it 4 stars and move it up the chain in my opinion! Who else offers pizza AND video delivery?! Untapped market!  Even better than redbox!"}
{"text":"We had Marco's cater our daughters birthday.  The service was great, because our order was put in ahead of time and had to be delivered a few hours later.  The food was hot and great, which was a bit of a surprise.  I had never had Marcos but we got it on a recommendation and it didn't fail to impress.  Thanks for making the food a hit."}
{"text":"Overall very satisfied with this location. Their regular pizzas are average and similar to the other pizza places (hence 4 stars) but this review is for their deep dish pizza! It's really good and pretty much every time we order pizza we choose this. We have gotten multiple different kinds of pizzas in deep dish and they've been perfect every time. The balance of the ingredients is spot on. Online ordering through their website is easy and simple, and they always show up at least 10 minutes earlier than the estimated delivery time. Thanks Marco's and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER MARCO'S PIZZA!

The pizza is average and the service I would not wish upon ISIS.  Upon first moving to Berea I thought I found a nice pizza place but wow did it go down hill fast.  The second time I ordered Marco's, my entire order appeared to have been dropped as both pizzas were smooshed to one one end of the boxes and folded over.  Another time, I was feeling generous, and gave the delivery driver an $18 cash tip on a $22 order.  He looked at his hand and turned with not a thank you to return to his car that had rap music blaring so loud that he would likely have had hearing loss at the age of 25.  Because of this, I did not order Marco's pizza for quite some time.

Recently Marco's sent me a coupon reading \"Should we send out a search party?\"  The answer is yes because I have had a horrible experience every time I order your pizza.  So lets give this another shot.  This was the most recent and last time I will ever attempt to order marco's pizza.

I was out running errands and my wife called to order pizza with the coupon and she specifically asked if we needed the coupon.  The person that took the order said they did, so she decided not to order.  He told her that she could take a picture of it and send it to my phone.  After arriving to pick up the pizza, the person at the front counter refused to accept the photo.  I continued to explain that the person that took the order instructed her to send a photo of the coupon.  A second person chimed in that the coupon is required while holding one up and slapping it like they were speaking and demeaning a child.  \"You need to pay full price\".  I asked why my wife would tell me that a photo would suffice.  I was told that she was a liar.  With this...  I went somewhere else to get pizza that night.  The great thing about pizza shops, they are everywhere.

It is simple...  I will never order from here ever again.

To the owner...  Please keep all employees at your store.  I do not want them being released to infect other businesses and would prefer the dysfunction remain with you."}
{"text":"They went out of their way to deliver to me right at closing time which was great. Cheesy bread is awesome. Pizza is decent, for Vegas. Better than Little Caeser's or Pizza Hut for sure!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and their delivery staff are really nice and very prompt.  I'm glad they are here."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was great. We ordered Pizza, salad, and cheese bread and it all came out hot and fresh. She even applied two coupons for us! We will Definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst experience I've ever had at Marcos!!! Normally when I order service is just fine. I'm not the type to write a complaint especially a pizza joint but after placing my order at 10:00 pm online it's 12:49 and still no food. I called to inquire about my order, and was told that I was called back. This was shocking to me because my phone never rang. So i asked what number she called? She proceeds to tell me an 980 area code which is impossible because my number begins with 336, so we go back and forth with her insisting that she called me when she never did. After gettin very unprofessional about whether she called me I ask for a number to call and ascertain why would there be such a mix up. I was told that she was the manager and her name was Leah. She proceeded to tell me to pick up my own food, like i would after the way i was humiliated! Never again. Pretty said my first review on yelp is a novel about a mediocre pizza joint ?"}
{"text":"the worst pizza spot in the world cant even make shit right mot clean call the health department on them if u go there  watch for a 4 yr old and they have had cats in the bathroom uncalled for just rude workers as well"}
{"text":"We love Marcos. From OKLAHOMA City to North Las Vegas the great taste and exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Found their card in the hotel room and were looking not to have to go out.  Ordered and this was hands down one of the best pizzas I have had anywhere.  Priced right, reasonable delivery time, arrived hot...what more could you want?  Ordered medium half all meat and half bacon and ground beef, delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is incredible, the team is incredible, truly one of the most consistent pizza places myself and the family has been too. They also consistently go out of their way to give back to the community and people in need."}
{"text":"Ok so this place opened up a while back near me. Been wanting to try but was hesitant. So today I chose to call first before placing an order with them. I spoke to Joe (owner). He assured me that the pizza was definitely better than the main stream pizza you have everywhere else. So, after thinking it over I decided to give it a try. I had the pizza and wings delivered. The delivery was very prompt. So upon opening the box I was mesmerized on the presentation of the pizza. It looked as though it was waiting to be eaten so much so I couldn't wait to grab a slice. The first bite was amazing the first thought that came into my mind was FUCK!! Goddamn delicious (pepperoni and sausage) one the best pizza I've had since moving to Vegas. To use a catch phrase from a burger joint it's quality you can taste. The wings were large not some scrawny sick chicken wings you get from P/H or Dom or that papa place. So worth the money so worth the time so worth the effort I am a customer for life highly recommend to all will be ordering again soon especially since the Stanley cup playoffs are on and what goes with hockey besides Heineken, Marco's Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"03/12/2015- Our store choose Marco's for our My Share dinner. They delivered for all three shifts. The pizza  was absolutely delicious. I'm A Godfathers pizza fan and this is about as close as it gets. It even Surpasses Pizza Hut and that is hard to do and it stomps all over Domino's . I tried the veggie also it was awesome. When  delivered it was on time and they even brought plates, that's what I personally call good service. Thanks to everyone at the Concord Marco's Pizza. THE FOOD DUDE ."}
{"text":"I tried a sub here a few days ago and it was really good so I went back today and tried a pizza.  It was ok, kinda on par with papa johns.  Way better than Pizza Hut and dominos but still very crusty.  For fast food style pizza I would order again but most likely I'll stick with Rosatis, my favorite.  Staff is very friendly, parking can be difficult during the week."}
{"text":"Pizza is horrible, just get dominos if you want crap. They use fake processed 3 cheese blends. But I have to say the pepperoni and mushrooms are great. Last the dough is machine processed also. Doubt its hand tossed and fresh.  It doesnt taste fresh. I am sorry but I have had way better pizza from little ceasar. And even that's not that good. If you want real cheese and real fresh crust go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"First time ever trying this place. We ordered online (super easy) and did take out. They quoted me a time-frame to pick it up and it was ready on time.  The staff is great. The girl at the counter was sure to show me the pizzas I ordered to ensure accuracy. I paid, and was on my way! No issues at all :)  Got home and was very impressed with the pizza itself. The ingredients were obviously fresh. Not greasy at all. (We ordered thin crust if that has anything to do with it). We ordered smalls so we could each have our own and it was more than enough food for the two of us.  All in all great place. We'll be back and WELCOME TO GOODYEAR!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. The large looks more like the size of a medium to me. Just was smaller than I anticipated. Wings need help. Very small wings without a whole lot of meat on them. Lower quality maybe? Customer service was great, very nice people. My kids liked the pizza, so I may order again since its 2 minutes from my house.

Update: gave an extra star, from 3 to 4. Had it tonight and I got the extra large pizza and a Caesar salad. Caesar was great and has lots of shredded parm (which I love) and the extra large pizza is the size I like. It even tasted better and looked more \"New York\" and less Pizza Hut. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay. Not the best, not the worst I've had. Salads are awesome. Not sure if I'm going to order from them again for one reason...they weren't wearing gloves when preparing the pizza, rolling/flipping the dough. I watched them switch from taking money right to preparing the pizza with no gloves and not washing hands. Also observed an employee walk in to start his shift and started right in on making the pizzas without washing his hands or putting gloves on...just walked in the door and started the pizzas. I'm not a TOTAL germaphobe, but that is just gross. At least wear gloves when preparing peoples food. Thats unsanitary. Don't think I will be ordering from nor recommend Marcos for this reason. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Five star reviews for this very average pizza? Not in this world, workers need food handling training for sure and no gloves? Nasty!  Now the pizza, boring and not much to like, I expected alot since they say authentic Italian on the box, yea right will never be back Ever!!"}
{"text":"OMGosh ~ this is the BEST pizza I have EVER had.  I am lucky enough to have it delivered.  BUT it is SOOOO worth the drive. The pepperoni pizza and cheese garlic bread.  Delivery is so quick!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE MARCOS PIZZA"}
{"text":"LOVED this pizza.  The cheesey bread is enough to make a meal by itself but then you add pizza that is so good.  I liked it enough I even ate the crust and that is saying alot."}
{"text":"Great deals, well priced and the pizza was delicious!!! This pizzeria is definitely our new favorite one of the mount holly area!"}
{"text":"This was out first experience here. We just moved to vegas and this little local joint was awesome to enjoy as we unloaded the uhaul! 

The cheesy sticks were soft, fresh, and a little salty which I loved. The dipping sauces were great too. 
We ordered a small Italian sausage and onion with the Roma seasoning. Great flavor and perfect size left us ready to make this our new pizza spot. 

Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"First impressions are good very clean well organized dining room very friendly staff welcomes you as soon as you walk in the door willing to explain about their menu I ordered a mushroom and onion  can mushrooms and white mushrooms pizza nothing spectacular taste just like Papa John's even smell like them too very corporate place Papa John's Domino's any large chain place will be the same thing prices are average may go back to try something else but nothing to go out of your way for"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty decent.  however, I ordered a Sausage Magnifico, paid for DOUBLE sausage on top of that, and paid to have two kinds of pepperoni on half of it as well... plus extra cheese.  Guess what? - No more toppings than normal, definitely not extra cheese, definitely not double sausage.  Very disappointing.  

Then to add further insult... ordered a chef salad as well, with 3 packets of bleu cheese dressing.  All of this was ordered online so there was no ambiguity... I used Marco's interface, entered what I wanted, etc.  Should be easy right?  Well I got 2 packets of dressing, and neither of those two were the bleu cheese I ordered.  Ordered 3 packets Bleu cheese, but what I received was 1 packet buttermilk ranch, and 1 packet of Caesar.  Never othered ranch or Caesar.  

It almost has to take deliberate effort to screw up an only order so much when everything is clearly spelled out.  The pizza tasted decent, but Marco's could you please try to get the orders correct?"}
{"text":"The cheesy bread is the BEST EVER!!! Pizza is good, nothing too amazing. Except it's a great pizza for fresh out the oven left overs! I pick Marco's over PizzaHut or Domino's any day. Wings are pretty good also. We order here at least twice a month and have never had a bad experience with service, delivery, or quality. If you havn't tried the cheesy bread... today is the day!"}
{"text":"A nice place for pizza and excellent service & delicious food. Plenty of parking around. Open until late. The staff is very friendly and professional. I have ordered pizza and cheese bread . Really delicious food."}
{"text":"First time customer.
My aunt refereed us to go here since there pizza is good, but the problem was that we ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was brought to us as a vegetable pizza.

When we asked them if they could bring us a new one they said they weren't able to even after leaving a $10.00 tip.
It took them 2 hours to fix the problem after my aunt having to call.

The fact that my aunt just ordered from them the night before they also messed up on her order. She ordered diet pepsi, but gave her pepsi.

If this is happening everyday i wonder how many orders there messing up in one day.

First time customer. NEVER AGAIN!!!

DONT ORDER FROM HERE. THEY CANT EVEN TAKE ORDERS CORRECTLY."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time this week. The staff was very friendly and courteous. They have a nice little patio area where you can sit outside and eat your pizza. The pizza crust is amazing! It is light, crispy, and well seasoned. You get your choice of crust flavors, and we really enjoyed the garlic option. The toppings are generous. The sausage has a genuine spicy Italian flavor and tastes fresh. The sauce is delicious. As a third generation Italian with a family from NYC, I highly recommend Marco's! Plus, it was a great value. We got a large one topping pizza for $8.99 on special."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB DOT COM. Their food is delicious. I took off a star because dayuuuum they can be pretty pricey. But honestly their food is so good I'd rather spend an extra $20 than order from Dominos. Their cheese bread is to die for, delivery is fast, ingredients are fresh, and the pizza is super cheesy. We definitely found our go to pizza spot in our new neighborhood.. Just have to make sure to order on payday, ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered carry out was ready within the 15 mins they quoted. Pizza was delicious and very hot just how I like it. The wings were really small they had too much skin and fat than meat. Not doing the wings again.  Liked the pizza shop some day we might dine in. Cashier was very nice and friendly. But too \"trigger happy\" did not load my loyal rewards so that sucked. How can we earn if we can load them when purchasing?!?"}
{"text":"I am only giving one star and that is for the cheesy bread. It was amazing! Everything else was a complete disappointment. 

It was our first time there and we were greeted quickly. While we studied the menu, everyone walked away (into the back) and didn't come out again for 5+ minutes and that was only to answer the phone. The young man was on the phone a minimum of 10 mins and never acknowledged anyone in line. No one else came out to take our order. Two people in line behind us walked out before ordering. An older woman (I would assume a manager) eventually came to the front and was quite annoyed that she had to take an order.

The food was brought out and my first reaction was in regards to the canned mushrooms on the pizza. Not at all appealing. Again, these cheese bread was bomb.

You can see right into the kitchen and, as we were eating, my sister said \"they are doing all of their food prep and no one has gloves on\". This obviously unsettled my stomach. She then noticed one kid walk over and play with the cash register & phone before going back to prep food with no gloves. We then walked out. I never even got to try the pizza with canned mushrooms and I have no intention to do so now."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here and was not happy. The cheese sticks were hard and not appetizing at all. The pizza tasted like something that came straight from a freezer. Not impressed and won't be ordering from here again. I'll call Pizza Hut next time."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review as Marco's Pizza is about really getting the right pizza .  Unfortunately some of the pizza is bland or just doesn't have the best flavor - my last review as 3 stars and I would still give that for the pizza that we had the first time.

Now that we have found the pizza that we love, I can give it 4 stars since we really love the pizza that we get.  We will not branch back out to their other pizzas, just sticking with the one that we love!

We always get the special - $17.99 large specialty pizza and cheese sticks.  As I stated before, the cheese sticks come with ranch and tomato sauce.  We ask for both to be replaced with garlic dipping sauce.  Much better choice!

As far as the pizza goes - we get the grilled chicken Florentine pizza - which has chicken, garlic sauce, cheese, spinach, red onions and tomatoes (but we replace the tomatoes with banana peppers - something about banana peppers on a pizza).  This pizza is awesome!  We also get the crust with roma seasoning - we have tried the other crust seasoning, but the roma is by far the best!  We asked for extra roma seasoning this past time, but it was just the standard amount.

Note to manager:  I see you have done this before in other reviews, but don't promise an order on the house if there are mistakes that happen or something goes wrong and you can't follow through with it.  I am not one that seeks for free food or something in return for a mistake or bad pizza, but something unfortunate happened to us one time and we were promised a free meal - we will put it on your account.  It never happened.  An acknowledgment of your mistake is fine by me, but when you promise something else, make the promise happen."}
{"text":"Tried this new pizza restaurant out a few nights ago. It was actually pretty good, the inside is very small, 1 or 2 small tables so it's more like a take out pizza joint. We ordered the pepperoni magnifico pizza and we thought it was pretty good, fresh and hot. I also liked that we could get light sauce on the pizza because I don't like a mouthful of tomato sauce on my pizza, I like to actually taste the toppings and the crust was really good."}
{"text":"$20 for a fucking pizza? Well, you pay it because their pizza is damn good. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from Marcos. The pizza and breadsticks I got were good. Unfortunately I came in to get my pizza and breadsticks after the 30min they said it would take. I go in and the lady charges me for my order first and then find out they gave my food to someone else and said they already came in...soo I had to wait another 15min for them to remake everything. Then one hour later the SAME women who rang me out calls my cellphone and says I never came and picked up my order. I have never order from somewhere so disorganized. Give my order to someone else, I still pay full price for the order, then call me an hour later saying I never came and got my order angrily? At least she said sorry at the end."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time but I was let down in disappointment this last time.... Waited for over an hour because the guy who took the order didn't put the APT # in properly. Got the pizza and it was not the way I asked for it to be made. I was already frustrated enough that I didn't even bother calling. I've ordered from here multiple times within these last couple months. Both times were invalid orders. Such a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town period! Delivery is super fast only place I will get pizza from now on!"}
{"text":"I will be going back! My first time there and loved it. Got a medium 1 topping pizza sausage, and it was superb. The guy behind the counter wasn't rude, but I definitely wouldn't say he was friendly and I'm sure his nickname is not smiley. But food was great!
They also do it the old school way of putting an extra thin piece of cardboard in the pizza box under the pizza to keep the bottom of the box from being greasy in the car. wow! if the guy was nice, it would be a five star."}
{"text":"Marco's has the best pizza by far around. We have pizza delivered at least once a month. Once a year they give way their chicken florentine pizza for a can of spinach, which will go to a local food bank."}
{"text":"Taken me over a year to get here.  Let's face it, their logo is kind of off putting for a pizza place.  But, managed to make it in.

We walked in to order.  Would suggest calling ahead because they really are not setup to have you wait.  Chairs are lined up against a wall and nothing to drink.

We had a double pepperoni, old world and normal.  Had it on the regular crust.  Aside from a dash of salt, one of the better pizzas I have had since arriving in CLE.  That says more about the CLE pizza scene then anything else.

So you have several speciality pizzas to choose from or create your own.  They have three different crusts to pick from as well.  I believe there were 4 sizes.  They are decent sizes so don't go too big.

The prices are really good as well.  This will probably be my go to place."}
{"text":"I received a flyer with coupons for Marco's so I decided to try it tonight. The flyer advertised a large pizza with 1 topping for $8.99 and had a coupon code to enter online. Unfortunately the coupon code didn't work online so I phoned in my order. The person who answered the phone was polite, easy to understand and efficient in taking my order. I asked if the 1 large pizza with 1 topping $8.99 deal was available still and she said yes. So I ordered a pepperoni pizza. I was informed that it would be ready in 15 min. My order was ready on time and the staff was friendly. 

Once I got home, I dove in and tried the pizza and it tasted pretty darn good. I particularly liked that the pizza slices were thoroughly. This is important because otherwise you risk ripping off some of the topping from the other pieces of pizza. 

Overall I really liked this place. I'll be coming back for sure. 

I gave it only 4 stars because the coupon code didn't work online. Other than that, this place is good in my book."}
{"text":"This is some pretty dern good pie, actually. Initially, I could've sworn I saw this pizza being sold in gas stations back home. If it was, I missed out on some dern good roller pizza. But I think I just got mixed up. This pie is delicious!

So I'm a pretty simple gal - I just eat either a cheese pizza or cheese & pep. This time we got cheese and pep. The dough was cooked perfect, for me. Not too thick and not too thin... perfectly doughy enough to munch on the crust. Yes, I eat the dag'gon crust. The pepperoni wasn't spicy or anything...but you can tell they use a decent brand. I love pepperoni with thr slightest of crunch...and this had that. They don't skimp on the cheese, either. 

Service was cool. Seems like a nice group of people working together to provide good service. I really think that I've found my new pizza joint near my house. I just wish their pizza sizes were a little bigger. (._. )"}
{"text":"I ordered the white cheesy pizza and 10 wings.  When I arrived the girl in the back was asked about the pizza and she said she didn't make it.  The other girl then came up and told me they must have given it to another customer by mistake and that it would be another 10 minutes.  I left and came back.  It was ready in the time she stated.  The pizza was good but not great.  I would not order the wings again.  They remind me of pizza hut and domino's wings.  Not good at all and very small.  Also they had been sitting a while.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow- what a nice looking restaurant!  The pizza, subs, and Wings can't be beat.   I ordered the Pepperoni Magnifico and the White Cheezy Pizzas. 

The staff were all very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"First off I would like to point out that the owners wife monitors their online Facebook page and has a tendency to delete unfavorable reviews. Thankfully she cannot do that here. 
As far as a chain pizza place these guys are pretty good. I have no complaints about the food. 
Now service wise they lack on it and I've had a few issues here and there with them but nothing I can't over look."}
{"text":"I had NO idea there were over 800 locations nationwide in 34 states (and even international). BUT it's because their cheesy bread is amazingly addictive - SO YUM! we ate on the patio and I have to say it was so perfect for how inexpensive they are. Better than Barros. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am from Toledo, the home of Marco's Pizza. For the 13 years I lived in Toledo, Marco's was a constant. Great food at a great price.

So, you can figure out how excited I was to see that Marco's has come to the valley. But would it remind me of Toledo? Would the flavor, texture and consistency be exactly how I remembered it?

My friend.....it definitely is! 

If you want a fantastic tasting pizza, you need not look any further. And with a full dining room at the Bell location, you can enjoy in comfort. From this former Toledoan, you won't find anything better!"}
{"text":"This was my go to pizza place when I lived 215/Stephanie! I am so glad I am close to a Marco's again!! We ordered the deep dish pizza with a coupon we received in the mail (I believe $12 for up to 2 toppings) and a 2 liter and had it delivered... all totaling $20. Delivery time was prompt. The pizza was just as I remembered... amazing!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Las Vegas. Since moving here we have tried many other places. This is the best. They use fresh vegetables and you can really taste the difference. The sauce is Truely unique."}
{"text":"The 5 star rating alone is for the service! I ordered pizza for my company and we had 3 different shifts one being at 1:00am and Marco's pizza still made it happen! My team members were delighted today and all thanks to you guys! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came in for a carryout, but decided to stay and dine-in. Overall, I would say that this is one of the better national chain pizza stores, at least for the dine-in/carryout experience. 
I had a White Cheesy  (White pizza with onions, tomatoes, bacon) and I was impressed.  Not overly greasy, but it was a good balance of grease with a pretty satisfying crispness and softness to the crust. The crust wasn't overly flavored dusted/drizzled the other guys which I like. The cheese and toppings do the talking. 
Price wise they are average compared to the other chains, but there's some quality behind their food. 
Waiting to get delivery to hopefully make it a five star review, knowing that it's an important thing- fast, accurate, and still as good as a fresh pie at the store.
And they serve more than pizza too."}
{"text":"Wow. Best pizza I've had in a long long time! The crust was crispy and delicious. The sauce was really tasty. I got Hawaiian (just ham, pineapple and cheese)...the amount of toppings on there was awesome!! We got take out and it was still hot by the time we got home. I'm super impressed!! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good, cheese breadsticks are a fave in my household. Prices are very affordable and service is always fast."}
{"text":"I live just down the street from here and this is by far the best marcos/ chain pizza place in town. The pizza always arrives fresh hot and ahead of the time that is posted when ordering online. All the toppings on the pizza are always fresh and cooked to perfection. I personally am not a fan of chain resturants but this marcos has there stuff together and on point. Best chain pizza i have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Marcos! Sometimes they may get the order wrong like if I request well done or extra well done but 99% of the tine they get it right and cook it to my liking. They don't skimp on anything and always make the pizzas really well. Great customer service. The only issue I have is their app. I always soooo many problems with it double ordering, freezing up, or not putting the order through."}
{"text":"I am so upset right now over my pizza order. I ordered through yelp and was given an option of crusts. First, when I arrived at the store after a very long drive from California, the boys behind the counter did not know which pizza was mine. We figured that out and I left quickly to get home. Opened the box...ugh. Thick crust. I called the store to see if maybe they could simply make another one with thin crust for me and got horrible customer service from the actual owner! He said I wasn't his customer, but actually Grubhub's customer and he couldn't make it right. Seriously? After arguing with him, He finally agreed to make me one...but I'm never stepping foot inside that store ever again."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Marcos in other cities but was told we were out of their delivery area and was confirmed by a manager.  At 2.9 miles away, I could run there before the pizza was ready but they can't drive it here."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza but I do modify it from the menu. The thin crust is awesome and you have to get the crust toppers for the best flavor. My favorite combo is the white cheesy but I substitute mushrooms for the bacon. They don't skimp on the toppings at all and the dough is always fresh. The only reason for the loss of one star is their high turnover in staff, it sometimes can affect the consistency of quality. I think Wesley & Egor are the best!"}
{"text":"Who the hell uses canned mushrooms on a pizza? Our first time here and will be our last. Ordered a pepperoni and mushroom for carryout and when we get home and open it up and see it covered with canned mushrooms.

All the juice from the soggy, rubbery, canned mushrooms made the pizza soggy. It was not good.

It could have been decent had they used fresh mushrooms like every other pizza place I've ever eaten at uses. Way too expensive to be using canned toppings."}
{"text":"Good customer service, fast and fresh. Great if you want Little Caesars pizza for 3x the price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"A good solid 4 stars, the Pepperoni Magnifico was pretty good with the thin crust, they used quality pepperoni and the thin crust was great,  crispy and chewy at the same time, the second was a build you own thin crust and it was fairly decent and on par with other good pizza places.  I did a takeout order sine I live only a mile away, the place was bright and clean with friendly people working there.  I look forward to ordering from them in the future."}
{"text":"Great pizza, get the garden pizza, only issue is I feel not safe at all when they lock the door. You have to ring the bell if you want in. What's up with that???"}
{"text":"Really miss the Manager Doug , his customer service was the best !!! Sadly they no longer have good coupons !!! Well have to start looking for another pizza place !"}
{"text":"Now I know why I haven't had Marcos pizza more than twice in the 4 years we have lived here. It's dry and tastes like cardboard. There is no way we could reheat it. I wasted 23 bucks on 2 medium pies.  I got medium-sized so there would be left over to reheat after work. Needless to say we went to McDonald's"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas and super friendly staff.  Love you Marcos pizza you are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the pizza was great, fresh ingredients and they didn't skimp on them either. 
The delivery was quicker than expected. 
The price was great considering we used a coupon (buy one pizza get one free).

We'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Marcos hasn't failed me yet.  

We have ordered from them several times.  My husband isn't a gourmet pizza fan.  He doesn't need any fancy toppings. Hence chain pizza places will appease his appetite.  

We always get it delivered.  They have all been polite and friendly.  Every time our pizza is to our door before the stated time.   

The pizza itself has a great crust.  They haven't skimped on their toppings at all.  I've noticed with other chains the outer crust gets wider with less toppings.  Marcos is very generous which makes for a great pizza.  Their bread is a little on the greasy side but not too bad.  I think greasy and breadsticks usually go hand in hand.  

Even though it's a chain, it's good ol' pizza."}
{"text":"Ok pizza if you're in a hurry, starving, have a coupon and don't care what you eat. Don't get the mushrooms (all stems) and remember to chew carefully! There was a piece of rock and a bit of stick on the one we got (sliver of toothpick I hope?)"}
{"text":"Great pizza !! The place was very clean, we got the pizzas quick and they were absolutely delicious, we also got the wings full of flavor! I'm happy we came new favorite pizza place !!! Would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Generally decent pizza. Order ready quickly and it was very hot. Only couple complaints: crust a bit doughy (thicker than I prefer) and the website offered a loyalty code upon registration that didn't work. A bit pricey-right up there with Grimaldi's for one of their signature pizzas."}
{"text":"I called to order a Pizza and the guy on the phone didn't know what he was doing. I mentioned a coupon for a FREE CinnaSquares with purchase of an XL pizza. He says he doesn't know how to do that and had to ask a manager. He gets back on the phone and says \"my manager says we can't since we don't know the code.\" Why would I call to place an order for delivery using a flyer I got in the mail from them (with a coupon) and make some stuff up? Didn't even offer to figure something out..."}
{"text":"We got a Medium Pepperoni and a large thin crust, ham, bacon, and pineapple. I didn't have the pepperoni,  but the thin crust is very good. I am
Also grateful to have another delivery company besides the usual chains. I will definitely be ordering from Marcos again."}
{"text":"The past 11 years that I've lived in Sun Prairie, I have had pizza from every joint that has opened, is currently open or closed, and I will say, Marcos is one of the best I've had. I ordered off the door hanger, I believe they put them on the doors in my neighborhood just a couple days ago.  My mother wanted pizza too and since she just lives across the street I ordered the 2 2 topping medium pizzas.  I had pineapple and pepperoni;  and my mother wanted fresh mushrooms and black olives. unfortunately Marcos has canned mushrooms. So she ended up having onions and black olives.  We both had the thin crust. The flavor of the pizza was very very good, the sauce had a bit of a sweetness to it, which ik found very appealing.   So next time you order pizza or are in Sun Prairie I highly recommend trying out Marco's Pizza, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"We order Marcos at least once a week, we love their pizzas. The are super close and when we have ordered delivery that have shown up to the door very quickly."}
{"text":"Total lack of customer service. I called because a discount code that arrived in the mail did not work online. The person I reached said \"there is no offer on the Pepperoni Magnifico\", \"where did you see that?\"
I replied that a flyer was mailed to my address about the promo. His response was, \"I can give you the discount even though we don't have that promo.\"
Now he thinks I'm lying. With so many pizza places within a mile, no need to patronize Marco's!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the chicken florentine pizza on thin crust. Huge hit with the family. We eat at the place across the street as well, but this  pizza is better."}
{"text":"Tried to order a pizza online and the website is so not user friendly.  You have to enter all your information before you can even look at the menu.  It was just easier to look for another pizza place......"}
{"text":"In January 2018 I revised my review of Marco's Pizza.  This particular pizza place started giving shoddy customer service since my last review on July 2017:  forgetting to add ordered items to our pizzas/subs,  not toasting a sub when asked to, omitting things like marinara sauce, salad dressings, etc.  

In January we had ordered two subs...a 12-inch Turkey Bacon Club for my husband and a 12-inch Meatball sub for me.  After putting in our online order, a few minutes later we received a phone call from a Marco's employee who informed us that they were \"all out of meatballs\" and asked if we wanted to order something else.  So we ordered a second 12 inch Turkey Bacon Club for me as well as extra green peppers that we always pay extra for.  The employee thanked us for being understanding, told us when to expect our order, and we all hung up.

The order arrived early...not a problem.  Lol.

Neither sub had the ordered green peppers on it, though...a problem.

I decided to call Marco's Pizza and let them know about the omission.  The employee who answered the phone stated I'd have to speak \"with the manager\".  So I said \"alright\" and was placed on Hold for approx. three minutes...not a problem when you know you're calling during peak supper hours.  

A male voice came on the line...said his name was \"Wesley\" when I asked...and adamantly informed me that I had \"never ordered any green peppers\" for my sub.  I told him that I had and that I simply wanted to know if I had been charged for this 'extra' item not received.  Wesley then raised his voice and agitatedly informed me that I had \"never\" ordered this item.  When I asked how he knew what I had or had not ordered, he said my order slip was in front of him and that no green peppers were listed on it.

When I asked him to please lower his voice since I hadn't raised mine, Wesley accused me of speaking to him \"like a child\"!  When I asked if it was possible that whoever took my order simply forgot to write down the extra green peppers, Wesley then stated that the only thing he could do was to send out another sub while taking back one of the two subs we had sitting in our kitchen.  

Since Wesley sounded like he was getting ready to have a melt-down, I told him it would not be worth the gas and time to exchange one sub for another but that he needed to know that we were good customers who have been experiencing things left off of our orders for the past year.  And then Wesley...dear Shift Manager Wesley...hung up on me!

(FYI for anyone thinking I live in one state while being paid to give reviews elsewhere: 
My July 2017 review of Marco's Pizza was made while we were temporarily staying in Gastonia, NC.  (A family member needed our help regarding a problem.)  Our residence was still Florida.    

Since that time my hubby was offered a great job here so we are now permanently living in Gastonia, NC.  Thus the change now in my listed 'Location'.)

Update on this particular Marco's Pizza:  We recently met a person who has been employed by this Marco's.  She told us that Wesley is no longer employed there...that he was \"let go about a month ago\". 

Because the food is good, it might be worth your time to give this Marco's Pizza another chance.  I don't know how long Wesley worked for them nor if he's the one responsible for the poor Customer Service others have reported for the past year or more.   I think, though, that the new Shift Manager needs to be given a chance to show he/she is capable of managing a crew and providing good Customer Service.

P.S.
IMHO, the buck ultimately stops with the General Manager/Owner of this pizza place.  To have allowed such poor customer service to continue for a year and longer gives me the impression that this person might have had the money to open up this Marco's Pizza but either doesn't know what he/she is doing or doesn't care...or both."}
{"text":"Pizza may be good, but delivery times are TERRIBLE!!  Was told pizza would come in 35 to 40 minutes...1 hour and 20 minutes later STILL no pizza.  Makes absolutely no sense for a Tuesday evening!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. Way better than any other pizza delivery place I've tried in the area. Pizza is always hot and fresh!! Ask for delivery driver Kevin.  He is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Marco's does not honor their coupons sent to customers. Flyer sent with coupons expiring 
2/5/18. Yet they don't honor full page ad on the front. ?????  Brand new store. Should be shut down. Don't go !!!"}
{"text":"THIS STORE IS HORRIBLE! IF I did not have to give it ONE STAR it would not have gotten any! Called at 4:30pm to order food...It never showed up....We called back for the manager to say she refunded us our  money and the food was out the door...WELL it was NOT!  Over 3 hours later and we are visiting another establishment because of the ridiculous excuses and BS! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE THEY ARE INCOMPETENT! Never again will I order from here"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this particular location.  Delivery orders always arrive quickly, and the food itself is pretty good quality, especially the mushrooms.  We typically order the pizza and salad, and have always received a tasty dinner.  The store manager even sends us coupons regularly, which is always nice for young professionals who don't have a ton of spare cash to order out frequently.  For a middle-of-the-road pizza, I'd definitely choose Marco's over most other chain stores."}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time. 
Got a $5 off coupon through Yelp but the employee said its not good at their location?? 
Disappointed already! 
Hopefully the pizza is good and if so I'll give them an extra star."}
{"text":"Pizza - Better than Jets
Service - WAYYYY better than Jets
Price - Yup you guessed it... Better than Jets.

Its a chain, and has chain restaurant flavor but for quick pizza this place is great."}
{"text":"Pizza is a bit on the greasy side, but if you can get passed that, it is soooo good. I'm usually a Domino's girl, but Marco's always sends us nice letters and great deals, so I decided to try it, and now I think I'm a Marco's girl. The ingredients are plentiful and FRESH, noticeably so. 

I decided on five stars because the service is exceptional as well, for just a pizza store where service is less of an issue. I walked in to get my pizza, and the service was very polite and courteous. 

If you haven't tried Marco's yet, you must!! And get the Parmesan crust. YUM!"}
{"text":"We order here all the time and is always perfect! Thin crust well done very good. Cinnamon-squares must order!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, will definitely be back! Luis was awesome and went above and beyond taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Marco's Pizza since I lived near one in Texas. The management at this particular location has been great about reaching out and cultivating relationships with local schools- fundraisers, discounts for school orders, etc. and they've been easy to work with.

Their pizza isn't as greasy as other spots, which I really appreciate. Of course, you can cancel that out by asking for their garlic butter crust dip, which I will probably have to use hypnotism in order to avoid in the future. They also offer more than just 'za, with sandwiches, wings, and surprisingly fresh salads. We'll be using Marco's for a department lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Marcos Pizza numerous times. It's always been pretty good. But I placed the order for pick up and I got there a little early so I stood there and watched the staff back in the kitchen area and since I work at a hospital and I've been trained throughout the years over cleanliness and handwashing techniques in the passing of germs the one thing I have noticed that their staff does not have a clue on cleanliness. I watched one of the older ladies there scratching and rubbing all on her face and then she proceeded to wipe up the cheese that it's built from the container in the making of pizzas and toss it right back in the container. And she took her hand and was wiping all the crumbs and everything off of the workstation where they make the pizzas. I found that to be extremely disgusting. If they can act like that when a customer standing there and watching there either oblivious to being clean or just don't give a shit. Either way  Marcos Pizza has lost my business. Just saying"}
{"text":"Never coming here again. I ordered online and not only was it made wrong, but the manager, Mariel was extremely rude and placed the blame on me! Who does that? \"This what you order! I no make wrong! You pay now!\" I'm telling everyone I know how horrible she is, and shame on them for hiring her in the first place!"}
{"text":"Omg this garlic butter crust is YUM!! Chicken Fresco pizza was also sooo fresh and tasty!! The pepperoni was perfectly crispy and sooo good!

We were in town visiting friends and they wanted to check out this new pizza place in their neighborhood. Not sure what's up with the negative reviews- not our experience at all!

We had 6 people in our party- we ordered online and it was ready by the time we got there. The online platform was really easy to use and even gave an estimated wait time for the order. We tried the chicken fresco pizza, a garden salad and grabbed cheese and pepperoni pizzas for the kids.

Pros
- garlic butter crust: our picky eater devoured it and he NEVER eats the crust. We were shocked!
- the chicken fresco was TASTY! My only regret was not trying it with ranch as it would have been a perfect compliment to the bacon and chicken. 
- Super clean!
- the pizza was fresh, and they don't cheap out on the toppings. The quality was def much better than the other guys
- Plenty of seating available. They were slammed but most of their business seems to be carry out/ delivery
- We had two toddlers and appreciate that they had high chairs 

Cons:
- Although they had bottled cold soda for sale, I wish they had a soda fountain with ice. Not the end of the world! 

We shall be back soon to try out the magnifico!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza and wings in town always hot and fresh, Delivery drivers are fast and courteous.
The coupons are always a welcome site. We won't order from any other Pizza place in town."}
{"text":"I've ordered 3 times from Marcos pizza and I've never had a problem with anything. We all liked it, it's better than other pizza stores near me. I called in an order and the lady offered me a coupon that would get us cheesy bread and soda for less than what my order was. I've had a good experience so far."}
{"text":"It took to a little  long to get the pizza and it was great. But the right amount of toppings,sause and cheese."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. 2 pizzas and an order of wings.  Pizzas arrived PIPING hot but I'm not really happy with the flavor.  Had to add granulated garlic, salt and parm to make it even taste like something.  Wings were ordered to be well done but arrived hot but skin still on the wiggly side.  Had to pop them in the oven for about 20 mins to crisp them up.  Still just so-so with flavor.  Order arrived without the extra ranch I had requested so that's a bummer.  I'm not one to make the time to bitch about missing ranch cups so it's whatever.  On the plus side the delivery driver (Chris) was friendly and courteous.  The only thing saving this from being a 1 star review was the fact that everything was hot and the driver was polite.  Don't know if I'll order again.  I have teen boys that love pizza and the prices here are good so we'll see."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and food was delicious! We will definitely order from them again. Ordered online and googled coupon codes and there were a ton which is is a plus! !!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was mediocre. If they would add some herbs like oh I don't know oregano basil maybe some crushed fennel seed it would have a much bolder flavor and make it a five star pizza for me. Other than that if you go to pick it up apparently they don't have air conditioning so be prepared to sweat."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza chain in america! Seriously ....the ingredients are fresh, and sauce has an extra zing to it. The delivery is fast and my order is always accurate.  This place is a tad more expensive than other places, so be sure to ask if they are running any specials.  Look out for coupons for extra savings.  The staff are friendly and patient! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here. I found the customer service to be exceptional. My pizza was delivered quickly. I have signs on the door because I work from home and the delivery driver too heed to those signs! He was polite, friendly, and professional. KUDOS to your driver! When I got the pizza and opened it up, the size of the sausages on the pizza made your mouth water! I took my first bite and l almost died and went to heaven! It was so fresh tasting, and delicious! I had to call and give them their kudos! I will be ordering my pizza here from now on, I have also referred my children and will advise others to do so as well."}
{"text":"Wow! A  order to be delivered was wrong. Really! So after delivery I was not offered a replacement. Just a 20% discount on my next order. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything but the steak and cheese Subs. Delivered. Their biggest sub w double meat, double cheese is $11. Delivered. Two meals or feeds two people. Good stuff!  The only thing I would change is grilled onions and mushrooms."}
{"text":"NO! Do Not Bother!

Ordered 2 pizzas, they were delivered quickly and the driver was friendly. 
One veggie and one meat, plus a reasonable tip, was over $35.

The pizza was TERRIBLE.
There is nothing good to say about it. It is just a bad product and they should be embarrassed not only to serve it, but to charge what they do. 

There are several high quality places in the area, including Cugino's & Bambinis, where you will get a better product and the same or lower cost.

Furthermore, you could get 4 DiGiornos and a 6 pack of beer for $35, and you will be much happier.

I honestly wish that they would stop sending me coupons and \"We haven't seen you\" letters in the mail. It is irritating and I am going to answer the next one and it will not be nice. 

In closing, there is no reason to get pizza from this place. 
If you did, and you are reading this, then, \"I told you so\"s are in order."}
{"text":"We order a pizza half pepperoni have veggie, delicious pipping hot and delivered quicker than the time they estimated. That is the way that it should be. Nice job."}
{"text":"Well after my car got hit from Clarence Chester the driver I can very well put 0 stars if I could!!! Not to mention their disgusting cardboard pizza save your money and car. Seriously"}
{"text":"They were on time but the food delivered is crap. Wings are fried but mushy..:you know what I'm talking about. And the chicken Caesar salad was a large portion which was nice but the chicken is that rib meat shit. Not fresh."}
{"text":"Marco's is great food for what it is.  This is not - and you will wind up disappointed - if you are expecting a NY Style pizza.  But as far as pizza goes, I like it.  I do not eat Papa John's or Domino's, but Marco's is good.  

I've only ordered online and I love their website.  Every single item is customizable.  I can add anything I want to any salad or pizza and the possible combinations are endless.  I've only tried their pizza, wings, and salads.  The salads are super fresh and enough for two people.

The delivery time is super fast.  We ordered just after 7:00 PM on a Friday night and were quoted a time of 7:55 and our food arrived at 7:30.  

Also...both drivers were super nice about our dogs, and you have to appreciate that.  

The only thing I can request is to add French fries to the menu :)"}
{"text":"I been ordering Marcos for a while because it's soo good. I tried alot of the foods they offer, and loved it. However, this time around I ordered the usual pie, and it is completely unetable. It is drenched in grease and cheese. Looking at it is nauseating. I don't understand  what went wrong, this is nothing more than a pile of oil."}
{"text":"I received a coupon for a free 1 topping pizza in the mail so I saved for.a day when I was feeling particularly carb hungry. This business is fairly new in our area and I'd not been in. It's not very noticeable from the main road but has nice look from interior of the shopping area where it's located. It's a small restaurant with booths and lovely aroma if baking bread permeates within. It was not a busy time so I didn't have to wait long(10 min) to get my pizza. I wasn't asked what type of crust I wanted and was given the original. The toppings were plentiful and cheese was bubbly and thick. The o my problem was that the crust was thick too and overwhelmed the rest. I did pick up a menu for takeout and saw some delicious subs at very reasonable prices. I think I will try one of those if I return to Marcos."}
{"text":"I am usually pretty forgiving on pizza places. Each area of the country has different tastes. But this stuff is aweful. In the hopes of getting something close to a New York style pizza I ordered their thin crust. The entire pizza is about 2mm tall, and the crust reminds me more of a thick cracker than pizza crust. 

The thing that irks me the most is that they talk about how fresh their ingredients are and that they make all their dough in the store, yet my pie has pizza press marks on it, like you see at the movie theater or roller rink pizzas. Not always, but usually the sign of a prepackaged dough."}
{"text":"Doing a review like recommended from the store manager. First I will say Marcos pizza is awesome!!! The pizza is always great! My issue is with the store manager who has no customer service experience apparently, extremely rude but then wonders why I said a bad word to him like a little kid, well maybe because your taking to me like I'm some scum for no reason, sorry if a cuss word gives you boo boos. Tells me he doesn't want to make my pizza anyways and hangs up without letting me know who the store manager is. I call back and find out he is a store manager and I explain to him why I had an issue, never apologizes or anything and tells me FINALLY who I can get in contact with which happens to be the same nice lady that called and gave me a 15 dollar credit and told me to make sure I call it. Like I said before pizza I great, I have other adults in my home that order here too and have never dealt with this guy or really anyone else being as rude as this guy. Pam the owner who I believe I spoke with was awesome, but sorry maybe others from my house hold will order but lost my service, not going to deal with a dudes attitude. Sure my one person won't lose them to much money but just leaving a review like the store manager said."}
{"text":"I like Metros but visited this place a week or so ago, loved it, really great might just be my fav pizza place now"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in a while. Visiting Vegas and decided to order pizza. Pulled the place up on yelp and ordered. Pizza arrives earlier than the estimated time I was given and the driver was friendly and professional. Wish I had more cash on me for a tip tho. Pizza was great, fresh and very clean meaning not oily and droopy. I ordered the garden pizza and added pepperoni! Will definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"These people are below average intelligence 
Try to rip you off 
Argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!
Had enough of them I do not have the time to teach basic common sense !
The special reads add any pizza for 9.95
(Equal or lesser value )
I order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.
Simple right well they say they can't honor the \"2nd\" pizza because it's a \"specialty\"
What does it matter what order I say my pizza's in?
Is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? Common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?
Well if I have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it I will just find me a new shop!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and it was delicious! Got a small pizza and it is a good size to have leftovers! Not too greasy at all! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"On Saturday 4/7/18 their hours say open until midnight. We came at 11:20pm and they were closed and clearly gone a while because it was super cleaned and that takes a while. Super lame :( they are a new location and already messing with the hours but when we went again they slightly burned our pizza so they gave it to us free which was super nice!"}
{"text":"All good pizza, no complaints and arrives on time.
They also do catering or group orders which we got at work a few times but these were not very impressive."}
{"text":"The pizza  is actually good! Well great to be honest! The bread is softer than papa johns and the dough is slightly thicker,but I mean it's pretty tasty and they don't skimp on the cheese. I'll be back for sure! Wish I would have taken photos to post along with my review but what can I say....They have damn good pizza lol!!!!! I'll be back Marcos!"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for a INCREDIBLE pizza place in North Phoenix and finally one has arrived. Until now the best pizza you could get up here without spending a huge amount of money was pretty much Barros, which is very \"okay\" pizza. With Marco's in town I don't know how I'll ever go back to Borros. We have been in several times now. The service is incredible, the manager is TOP NOTCH, super cool guy who has been doing a great job. The cheesy bread tastes gourmet. The pizza is cooked to perfection and thank god it's not the paper thin New York style you find ALL OVER the places here in Phoenix (sorry but I like my pizza with some guts). 

Pizza itself is very reasonably priced and incredibly delicious. The ingredients are so fresh, they taste like they came out of the ground from the farm about an hour before your meal (maybe they did!?). The cheese is home made, the sauce, the dough, everything is home made and you can taste it. The atmosphere inside is very nice, clean, modern and plenty of TV's and entertainment without feeling cheesy, no pun intended.

I cannot recommend this place enough. It's a pizza place that feels like a true pizza place, not a sports bar or some kiddie zone. It's an adult, pizza lovers pizza place. Keep up the good work Marco's!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Fast service, courteous, pizza was hot and smelled great. Tasted even better. Priced like the big chains but is much better.  We want to try more off the menu but Marcos is now our only pizza joint."}
{"text":"I ordered online and understood my wait time was 50 mins 
The small pizza and 6in sub came a hour and a half later this location was about two miles from me. My pizza was cold and without any of the the two crust toppers I ordered and I didn't even eat the sandwich because the two sides of sauces I ordered with it did not come so I had a plain  sandwich because I ordered it without mayo to add the ranch instead.The delivery driver was kind and offered to drive back out with the sauces but at this point I was very upset and starving. He suggested I called the store and let the manager know. When I called I was put on hold for 3-5 minutes understandable as it was a Saturday. The woman said she was the manager but I don't believe she introduced herself. She apologized and said she would credit my account for a future order with them but at this point I'm not sure if I will ever order from that location again. I am a very loyal customer I ordered from the Lakewood location all the time it use to be multiple times a week as I work a lot and this is a great option. I love Marcos and the reliability of it and quality, this experience was none of that I was left really saddened by my experience it was like being let down or betrayed by your best friend."}
{"text":"I ordered 1 pizza online.  It took an hour and arrived cold. No apology,  nothing.
The dough is not even cooked all the way.  A very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was great! Nice flavor to the pizza and I loved the crust.  Price is comparable to other delivery pizza places.  I'm also really happy they deliver.  I will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Good pizza (Although very greasy and expensive)- Bad attitude

I ordered about $50 of food online. I tried to apply the $5 off any order over $20 that we received via email. It would not work. When I got to the location, I showed the young lady the coupon and told her I tried to use it online, but it wouldn't work. Her exact response (with a little attitude) was, \"You already paid online didn't you? There's not much I can do.\"
I can think of several small gestures that would have left me with a good feeling about my visit."}
{"text":"If you read the reviews few of them actually talk about how great the pizza tastes. I guess if you're concerned about a mean manager you may want to go to a friendlier pizzeria  (yes I realize how stupid that is even  as I type it) but if you want great Pizza you can do a lot worse."}
{"text":"The food like all other Marco's is wonderful. The service leaves a lot of room to improve. I don't order from them most of the time because it's a hassle. They send me flyers with deal that no longer work. 

Against my better judgement and urging from my wife I ordered from them.

This time was horrible. I decided to order the online because I prefer ordering online has less mistakes. I placed a timed for 7PM and paid bill online. Because my order was above $10 I choose a free movie rental. 

I arrived there at 7:05 and the cashier asked if it was a timed order and I said \"yes for 7\". He said \"we are really busy right now and don't have your order ready yet, but it will be out soon, just grab a seat\". 

I sat and waited for another 15-20 minute until the kitchen finish all their orders and mine didn't come out. 

Different staff members started asking me for my information about my order. 
 Turns out my order came in and since it was already paid for they closed it.  But, they never starting or completing my order. Once they finally understood that they did they then started my order. They finished the pizza part at around 8.  

I had to go through the same thing with the movie for the same reasons. 

I didn't get home until 8:30 which is 10 minute from the restaurant with lukewarm pizza because of the movie delay. I expected that because the restaurant screws up my order they would give me something to say sorry. My wife urged me to speak to a manager but I didn't want to waste any more time.

Marco's makes great pizza but for that I would never go back to this store. I don't plan on going back anytime soon but I'm sure I will go back in the future."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, HOWEVER DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY! ONLY DO CARRYOUT! They never come when they say. For example, I ordered and they said 40 mins (which is already long!) 
It's been an hour.
Still no pizza.
Hungry kids.
I'm not happy."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Friendly staff and very clean. 
Delicious subs. First time there but it won't be my last time."}
{"text":"I'm a trucker who is in town for the weekend. I'm at a truck stop that's a tad outside of their delivery area, But Thomas was super awesome and got me taken care of! 

Thanks"}
{"text":"We order pizza every 2 weeks or less and when we want delivery or carry out, we order from this location.  We have never dined in there as we have another pizza place where we do that.

They are always pretty quick and the pizza is hot and fresh.  A couple of times we ordered carry out and stopped to pick up on our way home, they admittedly said they screwed up our order and we're making a new one.  I walked out both times with two pies instead of one.  We definitely will continue to order from Marco's Indian Land."}
{"text":"Yes, they're open again! Yay! (they did some remodeling for the longest time *seemed like forever*).
Great pizza, great pizza's...I'm  hooked!"}
{"text":"They mailed me a coupon for a free medium pizza so we went and picked it up. It was our first time trying it and it was pretty good:) the store was neat and staff was friendly we definitely will be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"The chicken wings were small . The pizza wag greasy. And the sandwich was ok at best. Not going back."}
{"text":"Pizza is excessively greasy and overpriced. Crust is thick and drowned in sauce + a cheap tasting cheese. It made us sick. The service is alright, though we were tended to by a teenager who didn't know what she was doing while the manager, or at least it seemed, was sitting around not doing much."}
{"text":"Bad Customer service. Their server, Rachel, was so RUDE!! She kept giving us attitude. She should learn what is a  great customer service! The food was great though"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was having a really hard time picking what pizza place I wanted to eat and order into my hotel. So after hours of being on yelp trying to find the right pizza I asked the guy at the front desk what he liked and he immediately recommend Marco's Pizza and gave me a phone number. I ordered a medium pepperoni with hot wings and it was super good and they were FAST!! Faster than I expected!! Very happy with the food"}
{"text":"I have had their pizza 3 times.  Thin crust is very good, which we had first and third time.  2nd time, we had regular crust, which I thought was lame in taste and texture.  Thin crust doesnt suffer from sogginess in middle, like many thin crusts do.   They dont have wheat or other whole grain.

The offered crust dust (seasoning and cheese blend they offer to sprinkle on your crust) is yummy.  I dont remember what they actually call it.... crust dust works for me.

Toppings and sauce were run of the mill / moderately creative.  Chicken, artichoke hearts, pineapple etc.  Not Glass Nickle or Neapolitan style creative, like i often like.

The overall result was very good, though I'd only order thin crust.  

They offer a movie/pizza delivery combo.  You can call and order a pizza and a movie rental from Family Video to be delivered to your door !    Not sure how you go about choosing a movie selection, but im sure they have something worked out.  

If youre doing pickup, you can place your pizza order right through a window in the wall between Family Video and Marco's and browse movies until they let you know through the window your pizza's ready !  

The one time I was there onsite, they were really nice and friendly.   I also ordered the cheddar  to be left off my pizza and they got it right - only mozzarella."}
{"text":"I have tried several other pizza places in Brunswick  this Marcos gets it right every time ! They are always early on delivery times and pizza is right and hot !"}

{"text":"Love this place, the staff is very nice and professional, very customer service oriented. 5 stars for this crew!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to for my family's traditional pizza Friday! Marco's Pizza is always piping hot and their sauce is unmatched! Delivery was fast and the driver was super nice and friendly! Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Just ordered A thin crust pepperoni magnifico online. The receipt confirmed my order. It was 25 mins for pick up, and we waited about 10 minutes past the quoted time. It is a cold day here and I'm sure no one wants to go out- so delivery is a wait. But I'll cut them some slack on that one. However, what I received was a regular crust pepperoni pizza and not the magnifico. :/ How disappointing! So I sucked it and ate it because, well I'm hungry. It was not good at all. Tasteless crust, and super greasy box. Thank goodness the cheesy bread was pretty good. We need better pizza delivery options in South Lorain. This just won't do!"}
{"text":"We got a medium pepperoni and also a medium sausage and mushroom. I have to say I thought the customer service was friendly and just fine, the pizza was good and we found ourselves wanting more of the sausage/mushroom."}
{"text":"I recently came across Marcos pizza in mentor and I was overwhelmed with how great not only the food was, but the service as well.  The owner was very friendly and made sure my order was correct . Definitely will be revisiting soon!"}
{"text":"the pizza is usually really good and they are generous with toppings.  

unfortunately, I made the mistake of getting their chicken caesar salad, which was inedible.  the chicken must have been boiled or canned or something, but it was mushy, smelled funny and more than once I bit into a piece of fat.  it was not grilled chicken like the menu described it.  I also did not receive croutons, which are apparently \"made fresh daily\" according to the menu.  the dressing wasn't the best either.  

guess I'll be sticking to the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly service, EVERY TIME.  Favorite place for pizza night. 
My friends and I usually get extra sauce and extra cheese along with pepperoni & a mix of veggies.  The garlic and Parmesan crust toppers are both great.  The Roma crust topper isn't bad, just kind of plain."}
{"text":"Quick and easy but very high quality. Everything I look for in a pizza joint. The \"All Meat\" was everything we expected and more. We also added the chicken dippers and asked them to toss them in buffalo sauce (not on the menu) and of course they did it and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome every time! Swift delivery, and the first pizza to make me happy since leaving Brooklyn. This is my ONLY go to for pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had two pizzas there today,the pineapple on the one pizza tasted weak, like it sat out too long! The other pizza was adequate, not much flavor! If you like Peter Piper pizza, well there compatible. l can't recommend this place, it's just at best generic."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up. I was ready when I got there customer service was very nice. And the pizza was delicious the Hawaiian chicken is a must have"}
{"text":"This is some of the best chain restruant pizza I have ever had! The price is great and they have great deals also. The pizza is far better than Papa John's and doesn't even compare to Pizza Hut - Some places like Villia Pizza and Roma Pizza have just as good pizza. Don't let the two past reviews sway your descion - This pizza is great and a great vaule, I have to drive 10 miles to go pick my pizza - Its worth it!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and salad for a Holiday event at our office and Preston delivered the order early and it was delicious. He was great taking my order and very helpful offering coupons and discounts. We will order again from this Marcos! Excellent experience."}
{"text":"I recently tried the zesty meatball and pepperoni 
One of the specials that they are currently running.I ordered the pizza thin crust style and wasn't sure what to expect.. 
It was my first time. I think I was surprised of the flavor and the crispy crust. 
I'll be trying other pizzas Marcos offers, but for now a solid 4 stars.."}
{"text":"We received a flyer in the mail advertising a grand opening, so we decided to try.  I placed the order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes.  The person on the phone was a young man and polite.  That was about the only good thing I liked about this restaurant.  I arrived in about 15 minutes to find my pizzas ready and sitting on a shelving unit behind the counter.  The place had a \"Little Caesars\" feel to it.  There were around 8 young people working behind the counter.  I didn't see any adults.  I paid for the pizza and it was brought to the counter.  I was showed the pizza and asked if it looked OK.  I said that it did.  Then I asked if the quantity of wings was the 15 that I had ordered.  The person said yes.  I said that I needed ranch dressing, so the employee grabbed one little tiny plastic container and sat it on the pizza box.  I said I needed more than that, so the employee turned around and gave me just one more.  I replied \"thanks for your generosity\" but I don't think he heard me.  I really needed several, but remembered I had some ranch at home.  At home, I realized that I only had 10 wings, not the 15 I asked for; however, I was only charged for 10 so I did not complain.  The wings were dry with very little sauce.  My daughter liked them that way.  I did not.  Now for the pizza itself.  My family was not impressed.  On a scale of 1-10, we would give it about a 5.  It had what we felt was a funny taste, maybe because of a different type of cheese on top than we were used to.  There were unmelted crumbles of cheese on top of our pizza.  My wife thought it might be feta cheese, but we really don't know.  The bottom of the pizza was browned nicely, but the top could have been cooked a little more.  We just weren't impressed.  I feel like I paid twice what the food was worth.  The lack of taste plus the stinginess on the ranch dressing means that we will not be going back. 
 We wanted to try it....so now we know.  Just thought I would share my experiences with others who are thinking about going here."}
{"text":"First they got my order wrong Offered no apologies just expecting me to pay for what they missed on the order This was a 10-piece wing so I paid life goes on. Pizza okay rather have Barros and I think Barros is just alright Pizza. My main complaint is the wings they are horrible the sauce is the only thing that saved the wings my wife actually put the wings back into the oven at home to see if she can actually cook them more because the skin on the outside of the Wings is very chewy disgusting. Will never order from this pizza place again their service sucks their Pizza is okay their wings are horrible."}

{"text":"First time trying Marcos pizza! Wish I would have ate more than one slice of pizza to really know if I liked it or not. I, unfortunately found a piece of hair( a lash or a small strand of hair) on my pIZZA. I was disgusted and will never order from Marcos  again. I POSTED 4 picks for everyone too look at."}

{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail for \"free large 1 topping pizza with any purchase see store for details\".  I called to place a pizza order to try them out and also order the cheesy garlic bread.  I then began to place the order, I let the gentleman on the phone know we had a coupon for a \"free large 1 topping pizza\".  I was then placed on hold, came back to, and then was placed on hold again (this was already a little frustrating on the lack of training they provided to their employees).  I was then \"told I had to order another pizza\".  I let him know, \"I didn't want another pizza I wanted a order of their cheesy garlic bread.\"  Well after the back and forth I asked to speak with the manager.  I was then again placed on hold now for the 4th time.  After that hold period Samantha came on the telephone.  I let her know \"what the coupon said and how I was wanting to try them out for the first time; what I was wanting to order and try them out\".  She then, \"reiterated I had to order another pizza\".  I asked her for \"a corporate phone number\".  I was told \"they didn't have one because they were a franchise\".  I let her know they had to have a number to call in regards to customer service.  I was then placed on hold again for the 5th time.  Samantha then came back and said \"the phone number was 1800-Marcos\".  I let her know that wasn't enough numbers she proceeded to give me push back and said ,\"well that is the number\".  I said again there are not enough numbers for a telephone number.  This time I wasn't placed on hold while she asked someone else for the phone number and gave me the phone number 1800-2marcos.  I did call and leave a phone number for their customer service department to let them know of their bait and switch advertisement they mailed out an"}
{"text":"I'm only leaving a 1 star review because the option for zero stars is not an option. I called in an order for delivery at 7pm on a Thursday for 3 pizzas and they told me that it would be about 45 minutes. Ok, no big deal that seems pretty average. At about 8:30, we called to find out why our food wasn't here yet, and they claimed that they had no record of our order. Wait, what? You read our order back as well as our address and have no record of our order at all?? Seriously? Well after disputing the fact that we made our order and then asking to speak with management and then getting cussed out by said management they hung up on us. With that said, we ordered food from a different establishment. While waiting for our food to arrive from that place, Marcos called my phone back and tried to make amends. Come on now, you can't call us liars and say we never ordered food, hang up on us, and then call back trying to fix the issue. You already screwed up. We ended up ordering the exact same thing from Papa Johns and it ended up being 6 dollars cheaper and it showed up in 25 minutes. Don't waste your time with Marcos Pizza, because they don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza and staff! Close to home and quick delivery, plus they serve cold beer on tap!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed their food. The pizza has been solid and is consistently made. I also order the wings and always specify them to be well done. I setup the online ordering feature and it is now too easy to get a meal in about 30 minutes. Keep up the good work Marcos. 

The last couple times I have ordered pizzas it has been a disappointment. There has not been enough sauce on the pizza. I thought it was a one time thing but now it seems to be a pattern. It's too bad because the pizza was really good before. Now it tastes dry and like it's all crust."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area and prices lower than national/ international chains.  Can't ask for more from a pizza place"}
{"text":"Liked that as soon as you walk thru the door the employees all shout out \" welcome to Marcos!!\" Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this Marco's Pizza.   I ordered pizza and wings.  My food was delivered in half an hour.   The pizza and wings were hot upon arrival.  They were also very tasty!   I will order from them again!  The delivery driver was also polite!"}
{"text":"On our never-ending search for a great pizza place, we recently decided to try Marco's. We ordered a large double pepperoni with the garlic butter crust and an order of chicken poppers. The pizza was actually pretty good. I liked the garlic taste on the crust, but was not a fan of the butter, since pizza is already pretty greasy. Otherwise, super yummy. It seemed really small to me, though.. especially for the $13 price tag. I don't know if that's normal around here or what, but it seems like every time I order a pizza it's way smaller than I'm used to. The chicken poppers were basically chicken nuggets with a bunch of Italian seasoning and weren't worth the $4 we paid for them. 

So.. Marco's is good.. we'll probably order from them again some time, but it is not going to be our go-to."}
{"text":"During the week, I rarely have time to do the whole cooking thing (so bad, I know!) so I usually rely on picking something up. I remember seeing a pizza joint in this shopping center, so I decided to give it a whirl. I usually check the Yelp ratings, but decided to just be adventurous since it's a national chain afterall. 

Marco's Pizza is small and it is only for pick up orders. I ordered a large, specialty pizza for $19. This large pizza was pretty much a medium pizza with 8 slices. It was small for a large pizza. The specialty pizza was called \"Chicken Fresco\" and it had bacon, chicken, tomatoes and onions on top. Since I ordered the pizza there, I waited for about 20 minutes for the pizza to be ready, which is not too bad. 

The pizza smelled great in the car ride home, but the actual taste of the pizza was not anything to get excited about. The best part of the pizza was that it was super saucy (oh yeah!). For a $20 medium sized \"large\" pizza, I was rather disappointed-- they didnt have any special pick up offers or anything. I don't think that I will be back anytime soon, especially when there are so many other pizza choices in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been a customer since this location opened.  I have never had anything bad from this place.  I love their pizzas.  Best sauce and crust I have ever had.

I will always be a loyal customer.  A+ customer service"}

{"text":"Ok great pizza but on hold for 15 min then I call back and the girl has no idea what I'm ordering when I call it by their menu name. Management needs to get it together.  This is 8pm on a Sunday night, please. The pizza was a white cheezy,  I had to tell her what was on it then I had to repeat that it was a pick up several times. Not a good night for them I guess."}
{"text":"First timer here to order a pizza and cheese bread. I thought it was great. Fast too in about 10min.  I'll be back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Since this location doesn't have a review, I will provide a short and simple one. Marco's Pizza is definitely a chain restaurant but the pizza to me has a better taste and seems to be better quality than that of larger chains like Little Caesars, Pizza Hut or Dominoes. This location recently opened up about 4 months ago and we've been a couple of time to order pizza for parties since the prices are inexpensive. Marco's Pizza also shares a building with HWY 55 burger which makes this location very small but most Marco's pizza place are. I believe they are more of a carry out type of joint so don't expect to bring the whole family for a night out."}
{"text":"Marco's Pizza recently opened in the Mount Holly area beside Family Video and I decided to check them out since there aren't many other choices for decent pizza there. The store front is cozy and intimate which basically means it's small but there is seating for a few patrons. The staff is very nice and seemed focused on customer service and product quality; the two topping pizza I ordered was good and exceeded my expectations of a pizza place located next to a video store. Again, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. This location is definitely worth a try, just be ready to wait for seating."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Marco's Pizza because they're priced right and the pizzas are very good. Out of the major chain pizza restaurants out there, Marco's is my favorite. Now, I don't claim that they're better than some real local pizza spots like Lorenzo's but this is my go to when I want something fast and fairly priced."}
{"text":"This is a pizza place in walking distance of my house. My first time there right after they opened was not the best. But since I have received tons and tons of coupons and even gift certificates here from Marcos and I have had their take out 3 times and and am always very pleased. Always hot, crispy, never soggy. The toppings aren't my favorite but they are good. And its an interesting set up. I feel like its really good frozen pizza in a some what fancy restaurant. It's still good though. Especially since they always have good deals going on. Even if you don't receive their coupons, they always have deals online. I'm glad this place is walking distance from my house."}
{"text":"We've only been in this area for a few months. Out of all the pizza places we've tried this one is our favorite. Fast delivery every time and it's always oh so good."}
{"text":"When we moved to Vegas, I searched far and wide for good pizza, but sadly found soggy nasty rip offs all over the strip. However, one day I stopped by this place and ordered their pie with little expectation, and wow did they surprised me. Their pie was freshly made with fresh ingredients, and boy was it tasty. Staff was nice and friendly too, I gave them a nice tip even though I ordered and dined in. Only took 1 star away because 1 of their driver nearly crashed into my car as he was coming back from a delivery."}

{"text":"Went to visit my cousin April W. in Charlotte and was in the mood for some pizza.  They suggested Marco's.  WOW! I could live off the garlic stuff they put on the crust.  The pizza was hot, and meaty, and cheesy, and everything I love in a pizza.  Marco's can do no wrong in my book."}
{"text":"I've seen this place on Yelp and I had driven by it countless times and I finally stopped in yesterday.  Not the greatest eating-in facilities but the pizza was really good.  Great crust, great tasting toppings and good sauce.  I'll definately be ordering take out or delivery from this place in the future."}
{"text":"Visiting relatives in Elyria for Thanksgiving; got pizza and wings from Marco's a few days before.

It's not bad at all: chewy crust, good sauce, cheese and pepperoni was legit.  The wings were good, themselves, but the \"hot\" sauce was midwestern hot (ie, it wasn't).

Still, all things considered I'd definitely order pizza from here when I'm in the Cleveland area..."}
{"text":"I can't exactly get too involved for a pizza chain review, but I'll put my 2 cents in because Marco's is not available back home. 

Marco's Pizza is similar to a Domino's or Papa John's business model. Call ahead for delivery or carryout. No dine-in like some other chains: Round Table, Mountain Mike's, etc. (and sometimes Pizza Hut) 

Nobody in the mood for cooking or going out tonight, so we call up a carryout order, which is less than a 10 minute drive away. Got an Italian salad, cheesy breadsticks, and an XL pizza. 

The order was ready when I arrived and received a friendly greeting by the staff as I walked through the door. The store manager read back the order to confirm everything was correct and then thanked me for the business. 

The breadsticks were definitely cheesy from edge to edge with gooey mozzarella and Parmesan sprinkles. I didn't have the salad, but it looked good: feta cheese and fresh veggies (red onion, black olive, no wilted greens). 

Our pizza was fine: Original crust dusted with Parmesan. I was bummed out with the canned mushrooms, but it wasn't a deal breaker, since I had several slices. The pepperoni and and large chunks of Italian sausage were plentiful and mildly spicy. I thought the sauce had a good tomato flavor, and not too sharp or bitter. Ok, it's another pizza in an already saturated market, but it's conveniently located. 

Pretty good if you're in the mood or need something with beers for the big game."}

{"text":"Pizza was actually good after some reheating- It was cold on delivery. When ordering online the estimated delivery time was 80 mins on a Sunday afternoon- no holiday. But after the time passed I called to make sure the order went through (no confirmation email came) and then I was told politely that it hadn't left the store yet but yes they had it. I wasn't given a clear time estimate because the poor dude honestly has no idea how long because he was so busy! Got it about 45 mins after that. Driver was very nice and obviously very stressed and behind. All I have to say is please hire some more employees! Poor pizza guys! Thanks for being nice even though you are seriously understaffed!"}

{"text":"Wish we had dipping sauce... Just blew 60 bucks on what I thought was going to be 2 pizzas and some chicken dippers. Except they weren't really dippers since they forgot the sauce. Called and was told they'd be coming back with the sauce. it's now been two and a half hours and still no sauce for the chicken. Really sucks because this is our 4th time ordering and we really liked their pizza.
Update: dip never came nor did we hear back from them."}
{"text":"If you are reviewing pizza, seriously, don't ever complain about how greasy it is. That's just silly talk right there. All pizza is greasy, even pizza of the french bread variety. If it's not greasy, you're eating sucky pizza. And no one likes sucky pizza, not even the biggest pizza fans in the world. 

For me, Marco's Pizza passes the greasy test. I think their grease ratio is quite perfect actually. So when we go here we get the same thing every time. Honestly, I'm one of those people that once I find something I like I stick with it - variety is not always the spice of life. So much like everyone else, I agree that the old world pepperoni is amazeballs. I'm so disappointed I didn't know about this garlic butter crust option though. I'm so getting that next time.

Also, I'm a huuuuuge fan of their BBQ wings. I always get them to go and by the time I get home they are a bit soggy - which I LOVE. Chicken always falls off the bone, not stringy like when they get way over cooked. The amount of BBQ sauce is almost always perfect.

In closing, say yes to grease. Say yes to old world pepperoni. Say yes to Marco's Pizza. It's good."}

{"text":"If we're comparing this to the dominoes, papa johns, and pizza huts of the world, then Marco's definitely tops them all. I get why people can get thrown off with the whole \"Authentic Italian\" branding, but if you look around and use some common sense, this place is obviously made for to-go or on-the-go orders (not very Italian).

- The Food
I really like this place because it packs a lot more flavor into the pizza than the regular dominoes. The cheese is plentiful, the crust is deep (reminds me of a poor man's deep dish), and the ingredients are delicious individually. Altogether it produces a very solid pizza that you can enjoy with a nice beer during a game. I've gotten their version of a supreme every time and have been totally satisfied.

- The Place
There's nothing authentic about this place. It's basically a tad larger than pizza hut shops so you can fit a few tables for people who want to.. \"dine in\". You can see the kitchen (fast food like) and you order like it's mcdonalds. That being said, always very clean and usually smells awesome.

Overall, forget any other delivery pizza service, just do yourself a favor and go to Marco's. Knocked off a star for the lack of authenticity that was advertised."}

{"text":"This was my 2nd visit here for carryout.  This morning I ordered online to be picked up at 11AM. The website gives you this as the earliest possible pickup, and since they technically open at 11am I assumed they are probably there early, with the ovens going and able to prepare a pizza for pickup at that time. When I got there at 10:57, the \"'OPEN\" sign was lit at there were already customers sitting at tables waiting for orders. When the guy asked me what I needed, I told him I ordered online, and he said ok, we just opened so we will get that going before the other eat in orders. (these other guys had already ordered too but they didn't even bother preparing anything until it was exactly 11)
Anyway, I leave and come back 20 minutes later, and I am told its coming out the oven now. I can see part of my order sitting there, 10 minutes goes by and I am getting mad. I have a toddler waiting, and no one is communicating with me. Until I ask why part of my order is waiting, and the other pizza isn't ready. Well they messed it up and were making another (which I could barely hear because the guy wouldn't even come to the counter he was talking through the heat rack. Someone should have told me what was happening, don't say its coming out the oven now when it really has 10 minutes left. I would have canceled and asked for a refund to get the heck out of there for my toddler. 
Take pizzas home..including the error pizza. Everything is overdone. Cheezy bread too. Ham on pizzas very rubbery. Just overall not enjoyable to eat. 
I hope the franchise owner reads this and addresses the staff communication issues, and if you cant have pizza ready at 11AM then change the website times to reflect that when choosing a pickup time. 
Just didn't seem like the 3 guys had their stuff together this morning. And the other patrons were also waiting a long time, and asking for their food. They were all workers, and lunch time is supposed to be quick."}

{"text":"I know right? I didn't think I would have an update this soon either! From last we left off, I came home with a refrigerator cold meatball sub! LOL Here is the continuation of my untoasted bread meatball sub saga with Marco's! Before I get too involved in the story let me give the short version for all those who do not like to read long reviews. Short version: Extraordinary customer service. I mean above and beyond; it does not get better than this. It's not just the way they treat me but all the customers I see coming in and out while waiting for my food. They ROCK and that makes all the difference in the world. Too many places forgot how customer services works.. Marco's not only talks the talk but they walk the walk! They are truly about the customer!! Long version; Untoasted meatball sub trilogy: the mystery is solved! Well now I understand! I ordered my Meatball sub without any mention that I had been there previously. I only asked if I could get the bread non-toasted. Here's Is what happened. The lady who was helping me was on the middle register between two of her co-workers on each side. They all seemed to stop what they were doing and were oddly paying attention. Something was weird about this! Why is my order causing so much curiosity? Lol They kind of gestured towards each other and right away she asks me, \"Does it matter to me if the meatballs were hot and cheese melted? Because we bake the meatballs and cheese in the oven in the bread.\" | It was at this point everything made sense to me. This was their process and there is no deviated outside of that said process. I'm saying that is a bad thing, it actually brings consistency across their menu and stores. Like when you go to a McDonald's, it doesn't matter where you go In the world... McDonald's always tastes the same as you are used to. | I kindly responded with, \"If you have a process that you follow that no problem! Put the bread and toast it up as you normally would. It's all good\".  But she said \"NO! You are our customer and you do not like toasted bread then you shall have it exactly the way that you like it!\". I was super-appreciative of her ambition but I don't like when people go out of their way for me.. always makes me a little uncomfortable. So I came back with, \"Seriously, you can toast the bread, I prefer it untoasted but if this is your process than I'm cool with it. It's not that I hate a toasted sub, I just don't like it as much\". | She stopped for 2 seconds and thinking quickly she said, \"NO! I'll make it work! I can work this out and you can get the sub the way you like it!\" Again I say, \"Really it's cool\" and she responds, \"I got this!\" Her two co-workers seemed REALLY curious at this point. I was as well! LOL  I paid for my sub and sat at the table. | They have a completely open kitchen. I love that. I love places where you can see right into every part of the kitchen. It's like full disclosure... this is how we are making your food and we are not afraid to show you because we have nothing to hide! Love that! Much respect for places such as this. With that being said, I kind of had a good seat to see all of this unfold. I'm going to guess that based upon my first visit (when I got the ice meatball sub) and my current visit this afternoon, I must be the only person in the world who doesn't like their sub roll toasted! I realize for sure that I am the first person at this location to ask for an untoasted sub. Just a side note, \"Is that odd? Is it just me? Am I a freak? Am I the only person in the world who doesn't like a toasted sub? I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't mind warm bread and I don't even mind slightly toasted but I had some pretty bad experiences with other places l don't want to mention names but like SUBWAY!! They toast the heck out of their bread to the point where it was dark brown and crunchy. I don't like crunchy bread!!! lol. Sorry, I digress, back to the story! | She went and started doing her thing. She went and got a rectangular pan, put the meatballs, sauce, and cheese in such a way and then put it in the oven to heat up the meat/melt the cheese and all that good stuff. She takes it out and now there are even more on looking Marco employees. She takes a spatula and transfers everything PERFECTLY into the bread. Clearly, there was NO process at Marco's in Glendale for making a meatball parm sub without toast bread until I showed up this afternoon! Now there is and it's only because one person took a customer service approach that was way above and beyond to make it happen. | When she was done making the sandwich, she comes up to hand deliver the food to me.. I got up to meet her halfway and she was smiling the whole way! She said, \"I was able to do what none of my co-workers thought would be possible!\" Also, because of her smile, her friendliness, and true compassion... she turned a normally uncomfortable situation for me into something that was pleasant and enjoyable. Now, THAT is customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I always get the same thing and most of the time it is always delivered by the same person. They're always cheerful and happy. Pizza is on time or sooner and always hot and fresh. Hardly ever eat pizza anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! The actual food is good but the service is horrible. I order delivery on line the computer accepts my order so it must be in the delivery area m right off 222nd by Euclid Ave and they are on lakeshore closer to Babbitt rd. They take forever to bring my order and when they finally get here they tell me they don't normally deliver this far and act like there doing me some big favor. And if I order again I have to order before 8:00 pm. I ordered again a week later same story same B.S. I even gave the delivery guy a $6.00 tip and didn't even get a \"thnx\"  I called back again on a Saturday and they told me they only deliver here during the week. Screw them lazy losers. I had a job delivering pizzas from a spot on Euclid Ave by the charter house we had to take pizzas all the way to Lloyd rd! And honest to god I didn't care if I didn't get a tip as long as the customer was didn't think that I was there to take all there crap because they had a bad day  if they were cool I was happy if something was wrong I was happy to fix it  but Marcos thinks there to good for there customers so I will never order from those losers again."}
{"text":"I literally just finished scarfing down all the food I ordered from this place like a fat cow. I'm a pizza lover. I love pizza. Pizza rules. This place knows what's up. The pizza is cheesy and crunchy. The pizza sauce is delish and onion free, and the ranch is pretty fab. The wings are meh, I wouldn't I get them again. A bit soggy, I prefer crispy. The cheesy bread is a 7 out of 10, but I'm confident it would win my heart if it was pipping hot when it arrived. I gtg take a food nap. Wake me up when I finish burning all the calories in my sleep. I pray that's possible. I pray my jeans fit tomorrow too. Amen."}
{"text":"I thought that I already rated this one, but here it is again.

Their pizza menu is excellent.  Lots of options:  crust, thickness, sauces and toppings.

Manager checks on you to see if all is OK.  And it is.  A well-run operation.

Just one comment that is just wife and I, but their standard red sauce is over-powering to the rest of the pizza pie.  A strong, wonderfully flavored red tomato sauce it is, but it dominates the pie at the expense of the rest of the pizza.

We chatted with the manager who countered that the sauce is very popular and that they sell a lot of pies with that sauce.  So it is a matter of taste.  We did return for the white sauce pie and it was just fine.

But fair warning.  Ask for a taste before you invest in a pie that you might not like.  The manager said that would be fine with him.

So give it a shot."}
{"text":"This is honestly the only place we order pizza from. The pizza is great and their chicken sub is good as well. The price is a little high but Delivery is always on time and never backed up like some of the other pizza places."}
{"text":"First time leftover pizza was thrown out rather then kept. This is not authentic Italian pizza, it's on the same level as little Caesars or any other corporate chain."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my grandma for Mother's Day and we were I the very happy we did. Nate was super kind and welcomed us at the door. This pizza is fresh , generous cheese and we got the Italian sausage with onion and it was perfect! Took the leftovers home."}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed, I have options around me and I decided to try them one day and haven't looked back every order has been correct and hot on delivery. I have gotten a few of my friends to swap over to marco's. I only give 4/5 because it's good pizza but not the best pizza I've ever had, it's pretty standard Sunday football pizza."}
{"text":"We've been ordering pizza from this Marco's for a half a year after a ten year long break. I have to say, it was definitely worth ordering pizza from this chain again. The pizza is always hot and fresh out of the box and is perfect for leftovers. I don't know why we stopped coming here ten years ago, but the pizza here is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me and I have been sitting on the receipt and my notes for awhile.  In fact I would have been a first rater had I not hesitated as we went in the week this location opened.

We ordered a Delux Uno, a good array of toppings.  Dough is flavorful and they regularly will do a thin crust which we prefer over the bread-dense varieties.  The tomato sauce is very yummy good.  And that is the good news. The bad news is that the flavor is so powerful that we could not taste anything else of the pizza!

So what do we say?  The tomato sauce would be great for dipping in pizza dough but overpowers the rest of the pie.

The manager is a really nice guy and we chatted with him.  He was surprised and said that the sauce was the most popular reason people ordered Marco's.  OK...understood.

We returned the next week and ordered their White Cheezy pie and it was excellent.  We told the manager so and we all had a laugh. 

Marco's is popular, delivers and offers various crust styles, free crust toppers or flavorings and and excellent menu of pies, subs, salads and pastas.  Coupons are sent out on a regular basis offering lots of deals.

Just wanted you to know that the tomato sauce is strong and dominating.  Maybe you could take a taste to make certain before ordering.  Am certain that they would accommodate you as the manager and crew are really a nice bunch of people."}
{"text":"DM gave me a credit to give them another chance which I did.  It was better the second time around, but again not perfect.  I will say that unlike my previous review it is a step up from most of the other franchises (they make their own dough in house for example yet they don't make their own blue cheese which comes in pre-packaged cups).  However, it is not Lorenzo's, Luigi's, Junior's,Palone's, Bisonte, etc.  You could serve this pizza to anyone and they would know it's conveyor oven franchise pizza.  No one would say that it is \"authentic Italian Pizza\" which is probably why that say \"ahhh-thentic\" instead.  Also, the chicken wings are baked (reheated) with sauce drizzled on them - sigh.  

If I was ordering from a franchise, I'd go to Marco's first (unless there was a Jet's nearby - best franchise pizza IMO).  But I am part Italian and there is no way this is authentic Italian pizza.  Try serving it to someone from the boot.

I appreciate the chance to give it another try and have ordered it once since then, but don't expect a real pizza like the aforementioned places."}
{"text":"When they first opened I thought I'd try it out. I had ordered online and was very specific on what toppings I wanted and how I wanted parmesan on the crust. That order was good and the cheese bread was good. They delivered within 50 minutes. But the second time I ordered online which was only 3 weeks after having that first order they went downhill. I guess they don't look at the ticket to see when it says no mushrooms and no italian sausage that means don't put it on there. They put it on there :/ the pizza wasn't even baked all the way through. Had squishy dough under the cheese and toppings. The marinara sauce was cold for the cheese bread and the mild wings barely had sauce on them. I was bummed because it cost a little over $40 bucks."}
{"text":"Good online ordering and manual punch card, but online coupons don't work and management will not make an on site adjustment.

Salad was crisp with ample dressing on the side... although the packets were room temp.

The light crust is airy... the regular crust is gummy... be careful with the crust flavors... some pre-selected topping combinations come with multiple flavors added to the crust and it ends up WAY too salty.

Not too greasy... cheese doesn't have much flavor...sausage and pepperoni have just the right amount of spice.

Not the worst... not the best... rewards for frequent orders... a go to place in a pinch when dinner is ruined... but not something to plan an evening around."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a handful of times and it has progressively gotten worse the last 3 or 4 times. Tonight is definitely the last time I order from here. Very basic pizza, just cheese and pineapple. I opened the box and the pizza was burnt. I take a bite and there is no sauce! I mean I had to lift up the burnt cheese to check for sauce! I love pizza crust, but it wasn't edible. So let's sum this up, no sauce, burnt and dry. Yep, pretty sure I've had better Little Caeser's back in the day."}
{"text":"Ordered a thin crust 10 inch Garden pizza. Good size for a adult. Crust was crispy but tasted like it was frozen not fresh made. Sauce was ok... needed to put some salt and crushed red pepper on it. Toppings were good. Decent portion of mushrooms and tomatoes. Skipped the feta cheese. Over all an average fast food pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered told 15 minutes not 27. Five others helped. Busy must be good or cheap but def not on time. The employees didn't look clean. Dirty greasy hair. Wrinkly clothes and no free crazy bread for 30 days. What?????"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff...ordered from this location several times and have always enjoyed the food.  We used Marco's on Tuesday to cater our daughters birthday party, everyone enjoyed the pizza and my parents, who had never tried Marcos, said they would check out the North Las Vegas location near their home....Also, thanks again to Pam for your assistance in helping us decide what to order and how much. Everything came out great, thank you, Pam and staff!!"}
{"text":"I'm still waiting on my gosh darn dipping sauce man this is ridiculous it's been 2 and a half hours since i called and told them my sauce for my chicken is missing and they said they would redeliver. My order was for 50$ and I tipped over 30% this is dumb! Avoid this poop covered pop tart of a pizza joint i have 2 large pies and and large thing of chicken here so cold it has frost bite because of no con found Dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The fact that you won't deliver to me is why you get two stars. Dont litter my mailbox with advertisements and then tell me I'm not in your service area for delivery when I live right on jones. I spent $52 and still no delivery. Here's the kicker they deliver to my best friend, on multiple occasions AND HE LIVES ON THE SAME ST."}
{"text":"This is the first time my husband and I had been to Marcos pizza. It is the brand new location just outside the San Tan Costco. The inside was smaller than I was expecting but it was very clean and aesthetically pleasing. And there is also more seating outside. It was kind of cool that there was a window to the kitchen inside where you could see the chefs were working on the pizzas. The girl at the front was friendly and helpful. We ordered the pizza with chicken, spinach, tomatos, and red onions and the boneless wings starter. They were actually out of spinach so the offered us free cheezy bread which was tasty and actually quite an impressive gesture. The boneless wings were hot and fresh and seemed good quality and were yummy. The pizza was great, with a nice crisp crust, the ingredients you could tell were fresh. This place is a new favorite for us. It's super close, clean, good service, great food- simple, fresh, and quality."}
{"text":"We used to live in Tampa, FL. and would get Marco's from time to time so when one came out here to Surprise, AZ.  we decided to give them a shot just to change things up in our pizza rotation.  The pizza at this location is absolutely atrocious. I'm not trying to be rude but the pizza is flat-out awful.  I feel strongly that a frozen DiGiornio or Freschetta pizza is a far better value than what was served here - and I rarely will eat either of those.  The crust was obviously made somewhere else and shipped as a frozen disc.  Every single vegetable topping (between the two pizzas there was pineapple, red onion, mushrooms, and green olives) had literally no taste, leading me to believe it too was frozen and just reheated in the pizza oven.  The mushrooms were clearly canned - I haven't seen a pizza place used canned mushrooms in a very long time.  The crust was just doughy, overly chewy, and tasteless.  The pizza tasted exactly like something you'd get from a grocery store freezer aisle except at 3x the cost.  The image they use on their pizza boxes doesn't even look remotely close to the product inside.  I'm not a mean person, nor am I a person who complains about every small thing but wow, do I  feel like I was robbed. I don't know if there was some shift in how their franchises operate in the years since we last had their pizza back in Florida, or if this particular location is just really cutting corners but I don't see this spot staying in business for much longer.  The fact we were order number 35 on a Saturday night and there was not another soul in the building aside from the employees should speak volumes about the product being served.Stay far far away."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst pizza restaurants I've eaten at. The pizza was so greasy it bleed through the box and onto the towel I had placed underneath it. The pepperoni they use is very salty and the sausage unnecessarily large.  The cheese sticks were lacking in the cheese department and were saltier than the pepperoni and was also very greasy. If you like a Pizza Hut pan pizza style pizza loaded with grease and enough salt to give you hypertension in one slice this is the place for you. Also the employees are not very sanitary often going from ringing up customers, answering the phone and hoping right back into making your pizza without washing hands unless the customer tells them otherwise. All in all, I wouldn't eat here again even if it was free."}
{"text":"Great pizza, decent price, and convenient hotel room delivery. I recommend the thin crust."}
{"text":"Good pizza but horrible service. Very rude on the phone when asking questions about their specials. Will call another pizza place that can take the time to talk to me. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Wow we just did our usual order of 2 pizzas, one thin crust the other hand-tossed and a salad. We always use Marcos because they were the first to offer good salads so stuck with them all these years. But I have to say tonight was the best pizzas ever and we've had our fair share of them all over the country! They were perfectly cooked and delivered quickly. Just the right amount of sauce, toppings plentiful and oh my the Italian sausage they used was so perfectly tender. I don't know if Marcos upped their desire to get/retain customers or tonight's feast for all of us was because of the staff on hand, if so pleeeese Marco's of Stow figure out how to keep this going.!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't received my pizzas yet, but Dominque is the best on the phone.  I hope she comes through with the cinnamon twist.
Update: Dominque failed me. No cinnamon twist.  Girl, I thought we had something."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! My sub roll almost seemed like it was made out of cheese it was so good!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering Marco's pizza for years, but never again after my quick interaction with its unprofessional owner. An employee, even a manager, I can forgive for such abysmal customer service, but I expect more from an owner. Imagine how he talks to his own employees!

I called to ask a simple question about my card being charged multiple times and he completely dismissed any wrongdoing at his end and COMMANDED me to call my bank. Well, I had already spoke with my credit card company and I also have experience working with credit card companies so I know he can call with his merchant id to take the hold off. Sure, he could have declined to call them because of laziness or whatnot and I would have totally accepted that and continued to frequent his establishment. BUT, I have never been spoken to so rudely by anyone... ever, and that is why I will never return and inform all my friends and family what a horrible man owns this franchise.

He actually tried to pick a fight with me over the phone. I am a very polite person and his yelling at me in a tone normally reserved for dogs and children had me so flustered that at one point I said meekly \" I can't believe you're being so...\" (The statement slipped out in surprise and I did not finish it because its not my manner to insult people). He yelled back \"I'm being so WHAT WHAT!\" I said \"you're being rude.\" Then he started ranting at me with things like \"Me? Rude!?\" Finally, I had to just hang up on him as opposed to being verbally assaulted by a crazy man.

So my advice- stay as far as possible away from the owner of this place and the only way to assure that you will never have to interact with this incredibly unpleasant and unprofessional person is to NOT ORDER HERE."}
{"text":"Pizza is average. Wings are horrible,  baked and soggy. I have ordered pick up a few times. Everytime I go in to pick up there is a wait. Not because there is anyone in front of me but because there never seems to be any employees working the counter. Last Monday we walked in and waited five minutes. The lady making food did greet us but then went back to what she was doing. Our food just sitting there on the counter. Also, neither of the employees were wearing gloves while preparing food. 
I can only assume that is what made two out of three of us sick later on that evening.
Will not be returning, already gave too many chances."}
{"text":"For a cheap pizza place this place is not bad at all.

1. The prices are pretty fair. 
2.The pizza is pretty good for the price.
3.The staff is nice and respectful.
4.Looks clean inside.

I like Marcos it's not a fancy pizza place but it gets the job done. If I want a pizza to watch the sports I would order from here. Overall I give Marcos  7/10"}
{"text":"Yikes.   Another pizza place.   Oh.  They make dough.  Yawn.   

No one wears gloves.  Even after mentioning it.   Staff is bickering.  Staff is clearly not happy.  

My opinion...another franchise trying to make it In THE most competitive work environment for food service.  

Food service workers have zero loyalty.  They don't care.  

Managers pull their hair out trying to motivate, grow, encourage staff - to no avail cuz they can jump to another food spot.  

Save your money.  Go to Rays Pizza a few blocks away.  

Sorry guys.  Nothing compelling about your story.  Sorry you are paying franchise fees out the wazzoo; it won't change.  

Minimum wage is now $10.00.   For surly, non-loyal, snippy staff.   Close up while you are ahead."}
{"text":"My family and I ate there today for lunch. We ordered 2 xl pizzas and some cheese bread. The food did take a while to come out but then again we ordered a lot and they make it fresh so we didn't mind waiting. The food was great and everyone agreed they would eat there again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved from the Toledo, Ohio area to Madison last year. One of our biggest concerns was that we were going to miss all of the fantastic pizza places that we frequented in Ohio. You would not believe how incredibly ecstatic we were when we realized that there was a Marco's Pizza in Sun Prairie. Marco's Pizza was founded in Toledo, Ohio, so I feel as though we can speak to how great this location is in comparison. This location is wonderful and Marco's Pizza, in general, is great. We normally pick-up our pizza and drive home with it. Even after the 25 minute drive, the pizza is still great. The sandwiches are also fantastic."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Ohio and I was in search of a great pizza place. Finally,I found it. The pizza is always fresh and delicious. The thin crust is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the Best Pizzas we've ever eaten! They have come to the rescue on those cold windy Vegas days. They have their Menu online and accept Cash or Credit card, and they do have Delivery or Carry out."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered a pizza, wings, and their cheesy bread! They told us 15 min wait time and they had it out in 12! The pizza was delicious! The cheesy bread was amazing! The wings were good! I would like to have had them a little more crispy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had 2 create your own last night and have to say they were the best pizzas that I've had in a long time, crusts were spot on and toppings were fresh with the exception of the mushrooms which looked canned. Italian sausage topping had a classic fennel taste. One was a deep dish style which I am normally not a fan of as I find them too greasy, this was really good!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious almost homemade from scratch: any type you want . They can make half and even quarters on the same pizza pie different type. It is very closed to where we live. Great service . Manager Johnny great you very well. Please come and check for yourself"}
{"text":"Being raised in New York ... I can be bit of a pizza snoot as NY is known for it's Italian cuisine..  Pizza being numero uno...  Well I came across Marco's  a couple of months into living in Vegas and it has been my go to pizza place since!  If you've never had Marcos before it most definitely is worth giving a try..  You will be surprised how hooked you'll get!  I like mine thin crust /light sauce/ light cheese.. It has the perfect bite....  If also like to say I'm basing my opinion on thin crust pizzas only.."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times now and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. I narrowed my favorites down to a thin crust magnifico pizza (I just love those little pepperoni's), and, of course, the cheesy bread! My son loves the little dippers and the meatball sub. I've had great customer service each time and the food is always fresh and hot. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Look, I love pizza!  I am not a pizza snob.  Is this a chain? Yes  Is it a fancy pizza place? No.  This is one of those in between places that isn't domino's or a \"sit down\" my grandma's recipe Italian restaurant.  This is just plain ol' pizza folks.  If you have to critique then you aren't going to like it.  

I found about this place is from a coworker.  We ordered pizza at the office and he suggested this place.  We ordered a plain cheese deep dish and put everything on the crust for about $13.00.  It wasn't ridiculously deep but a nice thick slab of pizza pie!  When I sank my teeth in this pizza, keep in mind I am not waiting for this place to blow my mind.  I was in pizza heaven.  It just has this taste to it that makes it yummy.  I know some people are saying, \"What's wrong with joker, the pizza stinks here!\" and probably rolling their eyes.  Well all of you pizza snobs out there, go ahead and sit down and spend $50 on a pizza meal.  I'll take Marco's any day of the week!  Cheers! 

-Make sure to put everything on the crust!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. Had trouble ordering online with the coupon, called and they took the $5 off my order. When they delivered they gave me free brownies for the trouble. 
Ok now onto the pizza. Order half supreme half cheese.  Very good crust and sauce is killer. 
The cheesy bread another home run. 
The brownie is to die for, super rich  soft.
I will be ordering from this place again. I am glad to see good food to come to surprise. 
Home run with this place"}
{"text":"Service was awful. Pizza was sub par. Staff was disorganized and actually lost my order. The atmosphere inside is like an average subway, not a pizza parlor. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great grand opening. I support any business that takes care of kids the way you guys did today. good pizza. prices looked reasonable. hope you guys can ride the wave you created today for a long time. keep looking out for the kids and your community and we'll be bacK."}
{"text":"I dropped by Marco's Pizza to grab some lunch. They have a nice airy dinning room where you order at the counter. I decided to order a slice of pizza and a meatball sub. The pizza was an everything pizza. If you love mushrooms, you'll be happy. I thought it was similar to a Barro's pizza slice. Passable and cheap, but not a destination pizza place. The meatball sub came on a toasted bun covered with cheese with a very sweet sauce. I thought the sub could have been more hot. You definitely will need a lot of napkins to eat the sub, sauce was dripping out from all locations. The total damage was a little over $9."}
{"text":"Took the whole family and a friend out for dinner tonight.  Excellent service and friendly.  Clean and fast.  Plan to make it an every Wednesday outing."}
{"text":"Honest to God, I don't want to give any stars. For some reason my kids insist on Marcos.  The food is average at best, with poor prices.  The last three visits, they got my order wrong.  This time, they forgot part of it.  I picked the order up.  Web site said 15 minutes...I waited 45! 

When I mentioned they had forgotten my wings, they told me it would be another 10 minutes.  I told them to take it off my order, and the girl gave me a ton of attitude and told me she would have to fill out forms and corporate would refund my money within two weeks.  I said that was not acceptable, and she gave more attitude.  I am just done with this place...what a bunch of idiots!"}
{"text":"Our neighbors and us have been ordering the meat supreme pizza couple times a month for several months. We have NO complaints!  We always enjoy the pizza very much!!
We order online and it's always on time!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place several times and it has been consistently good. For a chain pizza place, I am pretty impressed with the overall quality & taste of their pizza and cheesy bread. The regular prices are pretty decent (huge cheesy bread for $5), but the coupon deals are awesome! You can always find a decent deal either online or through direct mail. Definitely my go to place for cheap, quality pizza."}
{"text":"Let's face it anyone can make a decent pizza but customer services are right at the  top of the list Justin was absolutely terrific give me personal attention which I appreciated I will be coming here forever..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I would recommend getting the cheesy bread! 

I haven't had a pizza I do not like! I hate pineapple on my pizza, but this place makes it work!

Everyone here is super friendly and has a great personality.  They are also very helpful.
I very highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! My wife was in the hospital next door after giving birth and she hadn't had sausage or pepperoni in 9 months.  I went into the shop, hoping to get a slice to bring back and they only do full pizzas.  Usually a pizza can take 15-20 minutes and I told Mark at the front desk about my wife and he whipped one up in less than 10 min! Great customer service, friendly vibes, and the pizza is excellent.  I highly recommend.  They deliver too"}
{"text":"Great taste! Delivery was fast. They cut the pepperoni pizza up small for the kids which was awesome!!! Our Canadian bacon mushroom olive was full of ingredients. Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Really good! My fiancé and I ordered  a large cheese base with olives, sausage, and mushrooms, a bit longer wait for delivery than was quoted, but pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"Been away for school and when I saw this place I just had to try it. The staff was extremely friendly when I went to collect my order. I also forgot to order a crust topper with out hesitation the took my pizza back and added it for me. Cant find many places that will do that with a smile on there face. 

Food a bit greasy but I really enjoyed the taste. I will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"As a forever pizza lover I was delighted to be introduced to Marco's during the Super Bowl by a friend and even more ecstatic to discover a location on my side of town. 
Marco's deserves a solid 3 in my book. I did give Blaze Fire 4 stars because I feel it is lighter and healthier than most other pizzas, but on those days when you want to get a big fat pizza delivered to your house, Marco's is my new choice. I have ordered carry out in the store and have ordered over the phone. Both occasions the employees have been friendly, knowledgeable, and most of patient with my questions about specials and toppings. 
My weakness is the cheesy bread sticks--are super yummy.
Pizzas have been spot on as far as the amount of toppings, time cooked, and overall flavor."}
{"text":"First time ever trying Marcos... we stopped in for lunch. Staff was friendly and patient  with us as we kept changing our pizza orders. Owner came over to our table to see if we were happy with everything and took the time to talk to all of us. Pizza was delicious ...we will be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is becoming consistently subpar.  The order has been over an hour the last 3 times and to top it off, it's wrong.  I get the same excuse each time, \"we're backed up and low on drivers\"."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with Marcos , this is the third time I had it . The first two times where way better . I had the chicken club sandwich , the chicken was dry and the sandwich it self was very salty . Too much bacon , I will give u this place one more shot ."}
{"text":"We had Marcos delivered last week and it was amazing!  We ordered a large thin crust pizza with extra pepperoni.  The crust was great!  Only small issue we had is that our round pizza was cut into squares.  We weren't used to that.  We also got a free order of the cheese bread that was the best cheese bread I've had delivered with a pizza.  Very tasty.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if possible!  I called to order as we have done since Marcos opened.  I gave my phone number and told the girl I wanted to order what our previous order was (and has been the same order for years). She asked if I had a coupon/flier. I told her I didn't have one right in front of me but we get them every week in the mail.  I told her that I've been ordering the same thing for years and have never been asked for a coupon and they've never asked for a coupon upon delivery.  She said next time if you don't have a coupon I wouldn't get the price that is advertised on their fliers. I asked if management was new and asked to speak to her manager. She said it wasn't new management and her manager was next to her telling her what to say (I could hear her in the background telling her what to say).  I told her that if I don't have a coupon/flier  next time I would call another place and she said \"OK.\" I canceled my order and won't be returning!  Marcos you have lost a long time faithful customer due to horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Manager named Jacqueline/Joclyn?? has a terrible attitude! We were supposed to get a $16 credit for a nasty pizza they delivered to us last week. She informed me she didn't see the $6 credit and our total didn't reach their minimum delivery order! I informed her I would call Papa Johns to order and her last words were \"It's your loss\". That is the kind of attitude that will put them out of business! We \"used\" to order regularly. No more...starting with the bad order last week this store is going downhill fast."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza, great service, and fast pickup. Never had an issue with this location. Only place I get pizza now. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"OMG, the owner... so she says treated me so rudely. I  order a medium pizza and paid 14.05 while waiting I discovered they had a large for 14 99. I inquired about changing my order but the owner refused to do so. She did not want to change it because the pizza was already in the oven. She told me to feed the pizza to my dog and order another.  She said she hated people like me (assuming black???), wanting her to waste her food.  I will be getting a refund and shall never return. I guess she still has wasted food. Oh, the cashier who took my order was very nice, he just needs some up sell training.  I hope he doesn't pick up her attitude."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Consistently get orders wrong and the past few times it has taken over an hour for delivery."}
{"text":"I thought I found a go to pizza joint but, as I'm sitting here recovering from food poisoning from the meatball bake. It's no longer a go to - in fact, I will never order from here again. I could go on an on about how much money and time out of my life Marco's food has cost me. I'll just choose to learn the lesson of never going here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and good salt of the earth people
Will definitely point people in their direction.
I don't have too much more to say, Yelp is making me write more. Apparently my review is shorter than most, I've heard that before, 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"I had this pizza by chance and was blown away! I usually alternate between Metro and Blaze but Marcos just totally blew them out of the water for my favorite!  
I get the Deluxe Uno with butter and parmesan crust.  Yum! 
I will say though that we have not enjoyed the breadsticks or garlic bread, unfortunately.  If you're going to try them, order extra sauce."}
{"text":"They offer some pretty good pizza and a great Greek salad. The salad is big enough for 2 to share. I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"So far, it's the best pizza I've had in Champaign-Urbana! Reminds me of the delicious NYC pizzas I'm used to"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza an hour and a half ago and it still has not arrived. Marco's service is again reliably disappointing. I don't know why we even try to keep ordering here at this point."}
{"text":"I've gotten Pizza from this place a few times now no issues no problems food is good and service is great. Definitely will continue coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last night. Pizza was good and the salad was just as I asked for it. I had it delivered and it came in the allotted time. Will order from them again. Might try the wings next time."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered pizza here, it was excellent...the second time...still very good...

Ever since, the pizza is fine...nothing great.  The dough is chewy or tough like it is old.  I am sure there are better places out there to purchase pizza in Avon Lake..."}
{"text":"Horrible Service and Rude Manager. We ordered from this place about 3 times. All 3 orders something was missing and when we called to complain the Manager was rude as hell. We stopped ordering from them. Sad when Management ruins a business because they have no idea what Customer Service actually is!"}
{"text":"4/10/15 placed a call at 5:16PM.  I've heard of Macro's Pizza, we got to the track but I've never had it there.

This location is here at Durango and Warm Springs is THE BEST.  I really mean it, authentic Italian Pizza for sure.  The closest comparison I've had to East Coast pizza. This is our **second** time calling here. Cesar Zapata was our order taker..

We ordered the Double Delicious Deal for $15.99. A (large) pepperoni magnifico and CheezyBread. We added Black Olives for $1.50 after taxes it came to $19.18.

Feeds up to 4 people. We have 3 adults in our household and we have leftover CheezyBread. PERFECT to kill the spicy pepperoni burn.


Next time I think I'll try a small salad they sound yummy.  Their Antipasto salad alone sounds perfect. Ham, Salami, Provolone, Black Olives & Tomato. It's perfect as a Gluten free option when I'm not on a CHEAT day."}
{"text":"This is probably the best marcos chain.  Food is hot and they run specials.  We life to call around since it's around the corner.  The food came out recently and was piping hot.  They have decent garlic cheesy bread and we tried the large  Meat Supremo."}
{"text":"I usually go here when im craving pizza lol if its a let me order something on the fly kind of thing their pizza is really good manority of the time i say that because theres one peraon who makes my pizza occasionally and this i hate when you get extra cheese but theres open spot with no cheese just a bunch of sauce kills me pile the cheese on bro lol its pizza other then that the pizza is good fresh hand tossed pizza."}
{"text":"Marco's Pizza ended up being a hit for me! I'm usually skeptical to try out these little neighborhood pizza joints because of past bad experiences. They send out a tons of coupons and all these little deals in the mail so I decided a few nights ago that I would give them a chance. So because I was already in the area I just stopped in to do a take out order because delivery would've taken way too long. When I walked in I was greeted by multiple employee's all in sync with the \"Welcome To Marcos Pizza\" haha cute. The cashier who rung up the order was a bit dry as far as conversation went and just very like I don't know tired or something? Anyways she told me briefly after I asked about the pizza sizes and the type that they offer with these particular coupons I had. After figuring out that the large pepperoni pizza with the cheesy bread for $15.99 seemed like a deal I went for it. Maybe 10-15 minutes later I went back inside to inquire about it and it was done! Score! I always check my pizza before leaving because you know who wants to eat burnt pizza or not have enough toppings. From what I saw everything checked out to look just fine. I got home and actually enjoyed this pizza along with the cheesy bread. I'm glad my experience was good as I was a bit apprehensive based on the previous reviews."}
{"text":"We have ordered twice from Marcos and I was totally satisfied.  The pizza had great taste and they were generous with the toppings. We have yet to try their subs or wings."}
{"text":"FAST delivery, consistently good ! We have ordered from Marcos a few times and every order has arrived correct, hot and with fresh ingredients! One of our new favorite pizza places in SP"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this spot. Good food and great service! We will surely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the area. Price is reasonable and the sauce is great. They have a large menu so big selection."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!!!! My daughters now ask for Marco's and it's our go too pizza for Friday Movie Night!!! 
Although the last pizza I ordered with Mushrooms and it seems as if the mushrooms were from the jar...they weren't fresh. Or at least didn't taste like it, they were kinda slimy. 
I'm not gonna let that deflect on the other cheese pizzas I've ordered because those were Heaven  I would definitely refer this place to friends!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit here and the service is TERRIBLE. They do not need to let teenagers run the registers. They don't pay attention and have to ask what you ordered several times so you wonder if your order will be right when it comes out or not. The pizza is overpriced. 
On a Sunday night our family was there and the music playing had profanity and was graphic. Not wise for a so-called family restaurant, but when teenagers are in charge that's what happens. This is unacceptable for a restaurant."}
{"text":"We love Marcos! Much better than those big pizza chains. Tastes more home made. We have ordered from them about a hundred times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here twice. This is what we've found:

* Do you love canned mushrooms? If you do, you'll be thrilled to know that theirs come right out of a can.

* Delivery times are quite long. Both times I've asked for delivery, I've been quoted 45 minutes to an hour. Both times were around 1:30 to 2 pm on a weekday.

* You'll pay a bit more for what you get here than at other places. 2 large pizzas, 10 wings and a 2 liter ran me ~$50 once the delivery fee and a $5 tip were factored in, and that's taking advantage of their website \"deal.\"

* They have a fair amount of variety on the menu compared to your average delivery place - subs and hot dishes in addition to pizza.

The pizza is pretty good, but I'm reluctant to call it great. If I'm paying more for my pizza, I'm hoping for something like NYPD Pizza. Marco's feels like it slots in somewhere slightly better than Papa John's but not as good as Barro's and certainly not as good as NYPD Pizza. It's hard to imagine a scenario where I'd choose Marco's regularly, given all that."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizzas and chicken wings on 6/18. Everything was superb. Great customer service. Told them it was our first time and the cashier told us ever special they have. Will be going back"}
{"text":"Honestly just ok. High point the delivery was super fast and the pizza was warm and the delivery driver was very nice!!!!  My caesar salad had something on it I am not quite sure if it is chicken or sliced up little pieces of chicken fat and very hard stale croutons. I also did not get any dressing for the salad maybe you have to pay for that seperate? I payed for ranch but that was for the pizza. I thought Caesar dressing would come with the Caesar. My son loved his small pizza though. I would probably pick him up pizza again if I don't feel like cooking. All in all it seemed a little pricey for delivery though."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza here, but thought that it was a little overpriced.  I waited over 45 minutes for pizza to be done.  I highly recommend calling in your order before hand.  Not sure if I will be back because the price was high.  However, they do have awesome customer service and great pizza"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of fast-food pizza but when I'm in the mood, it will only be Marco's from now on. The pizza has always been delicious and fresh with some of the most friendly service I've experienced from any delivery driver."}
{"text":"We tried Marco Pizza in place of their neighbor which has been our long time favorite. However over time they have gone down hill and the search began for a replacement. We ordered a medium thin crust for pick up up and were told it would be ready in 12-13 minutes. Just long enough to drive over. The pizza was ready upon arrival. The crust was crisp and the cheese and sausage tasty and juicy. I think we have found a new go to pizza place. Sorry about that R you used to be great."}
{"text":"Good pizza at a great price. Not the best pizza I've had but budget friendly and quick delivery. The white pizza is my favorite with the 4 different cheeses, bacon and tomatoes. Totally unique and tasty!"}
{"text":"Pizza delivery service was a 1 hour and 20 minute problem...  driver was calling me from 43rd Ave and Northern, couldn't find my house?  I'm on 43rd and Bell!  Pizza was not worth $26 + tip. Might have been better if it was fresh?  Cheese bread was free with a coupon, but I wouldn't recommend that either!  It was a big blob of salted bread served with hot ranch?  Yum!!  For $30 with tip, I'll stick with Barro's or Stevie's."}
{"text":"So when we're visiting my mother-in-law, this is one of the places we go for good take out pizza.

We got two extra large pizzas:

1. \"Ground Beef\" pizza
2. \"Grilled Chicken\" pizza

The meat in the chicken and ground beef pizza met my standards: which is that they are juicy and taste good.  Both pizzas were not dry, but not overly wet as well.  It fell perfectly in the middle.

The ground beef pizza, AKA hamburger pizza, was a pleasant surprise.  I usually wouldn't order that kind of pizza but my wife got it knowing the children's taste buds.  I snuck a piece and it was delicious!

The grilled chicken pizza was very memorable.  I know for sure that if we're getting pizza from Marco's, one of them is going to be grilled chicken.  

The crust on the pizza was not plain and was full of flavor as well.  Even after you're done with the tomato sauce, meets and cheese, the bread is in itself a reward.

Take out was very quick and painless and I was happy with the food."}
{"text":"Don't order mushrooms because you will be disappointed. They use canned and not fresh. I've never seen a pizza place use canned mushrooms. It was pretty bad. I won't go back."}
{"text":"The pizza from this place is amazing, The customer service/customer experience makes me wish I was back in Baghdad fighting for my country; at least there I was paid to deal with bullshit. I used to get delivery from this place until they started forgetting parts of my order every single time. I decided to not be lazy and drive down the street three minutes. However they can't even get my order right when I come to pick it up. Don't expect much when they get your order wrong."}
{"text":"Don't bother calling in to place an order. They NEVER answer the phone and they NEVER WEAR GLOVES. How disgusting !.."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Don't go here EVER unless you want to pay for SOMEONE ELSE'S order & go through a credit card dispute. They charged my credit card for someone else's order! The \"general manager\" Sarah lied & knew she charged me the incorrect amount because she threw away my receipt without letting me know what she did! I had to look at my bank statement. They didn't do anything to make it right. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to order pizza! The old world pepperonis are out of this world and the pizza sauce and cheese is always great quality. The crust toppers are a must! We like to get garlic and Parmesan. We've never had a bad pizza here and we've ordered here often."}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza I've ever had, no. Is it the best chain type pizza at a good price, absolutely!

Better than all the chain locations and similar price to them. Not as good as specialty locations, however, the price reflects it! When I don't feel like spending higher amounts on pizza but still want a consistently good pizza, I go to Marcos!!!"}
{"text":"We are hands down happy with Marco's  on Bermuda and it's now our go to pizza place. Our 'other' pizza place has been going downhill and it was great to get the coupons and try Marco's. Loved the white cheezy pizza, the pepperoni pizza and of  course love love love the cheezy bread! People are super friendly and the place is immaculate!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from NY, and being picky about pizza I must say this puzza was very tasty. Great thick crust and italian sausage. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered online and failed to realize I selected no cheese on my pizza... unheard of right?! Ashley and Thomas put me at ease by taking care of my order right there without any issue or delay. By far the best customer service I have had at any Pizza place. I will always continue to come back to this location!!! Highly recommend Marcos Pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, old world pepperoni is the best! The thin crust is nothing to write home about, I'd stick with the regular crust. This location was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Wow, hate to be an ungrateful biyatch, but the wings suck and the delivery driver was unbelievably rude even though I tipped him 20 %. Filled out the feedback survey, still waiting for the promised managerial callback. Don't waste your time or money. Better pizza, better prices, better customer service...   well, just about anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but nothing special. Cheesy bread is nowhere near as good as it used to be, or maybe this location is scrimping on the cheese and the parm shake. Desserts are ungodly overpriced (can buy the mix at a grocery for 1/3 the price).

The website is a disaster. Seriously, call in your order."}
{"text":"This will be the 5th time in two weeks we've ordered from Marcos. Usually the large cheese pizza with cinasquares is what we get. Great service, quick on deliveries and deliciousness is always a good combination."}
{"text":"I was really hungry and wanted to order a pizza, so I logged in and searched for a good neighborhood pizzeria that delivers. I chose Marco's pizza and called. THe lady that took my order was really nice, and it was delivered very fast because it's close to my house. I am impressed from how the pizza looked, to how it tasted. I am definitely ordering Marco's pizza again! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Marco's Pizza! I get the mushroom and black olive medium pizza and my second pizza is a pepperoni and cheese pizza for only about $14 total. The pizza is always amazing the, cheese is awesome, the sauce is great it is probably the best pizza I've ever eaten and I've eaten at many different places. Also the people are super friendly when you walk in they're really great. And then as a bonus when you sit down you can charge up your phone, they have a USB port in their outlets which is awesome because then you can charge your phone. All in all I love Marco's Pizza is a fantastic place to eat and they're super fast thank you Marco's Pizza!"}
{"text":"I just ordered my first pizza from them.  They were prompt on time and read the instructions perfectly.  Good job."}
{"text":"We called Marcos Pizza after getting rude customer service from another pizza place. It was just before closing time. We called and placed an order with them. We asked about delivery time and also if we could pick up. They mentioned they close in 10min. I asked how soon can they get the pizza ready if we pick up, they said 10-15min, so I said we were on our way since we were already in the car. We got there shortly after 11pm and went in to pay. It wasn't quite ready so we went and waited in the car. A few minutes later they walk it out to us and the gentleman that brought it out was friendly and did not at all seem bothered that we called in just before closing and had them there afterwards to make our order. He even had a short conversation with us before heading back inside. 

5 stars for great customer service, very accommodating (especially since we called 15min before closing and we arrived after 11pm but they still accepted us), the food was made so quickly, and everything tasted amazing! My new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Well, another pizza place here in the Ballantyne area...what a surprise...WOW, was it ever!
After being flooded by coupons, I thought, lets give this a try. Using the coupon code and ordering on-line was a breeze.  The pricing was awesome, choices varied, and they even give you a choice of free flavored crusts like parmesan and ranch.   They quoted 35 minutes for delivery.  After 20 minutes, the friendly delivery person was at my door!  After opening the box and devouring it's hot, fresh, yummy goodness, I was amazed at the fabulousness that is Marco's Pizza!!!  Ever since, the order is always right, the pizza hot and delicious, and the delivery speedy!  The parmesan crust is amazing!  The coupons are great, and the on-line ordering system is quite easy compared to some others.  They are a cut-above the big-boys (pizza hut and papa johns) as far as flavor and quality.  After the years and dozens of pizza places here in this area, I have finally found a home!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"love this place always great pizza.  The service is fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I thought it was very good pizza, little taste of back in the Midwest.

I got thin crust pizza with everything duo Us, I believe it's called. This time I will try the same type of pizza only with original crust.

Little Bear is the best driver on the delivery front by the way"}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service!  1st time I ever ordered a pizza they messed it up.  They said they would have a free one for me the next time I ordered.  They lied.  No free pizza for me they said.  I will never waste my money with them again."}
{"text":"Love love love this pizza place. Always so delicious. Especially adding their garlic sauce on the crust. Yummmmmmy"}
{"text":"The deluxe UNO is really UNO! Great crust, just the right amount of toppings, not too skimpy or too much.
Online ordering process is a bit too much, but it's worth it I guess or just call in your order. I tried this place about 5 years ago when they reopened and it was a oily greasy drippy mess!
Never came back and could only see that bad picture in my mind ever since. Really good to see they have turned it around and I will order here again. Good job Marcos!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Not a thick crust and not a thin crust. Good fresh taste and good crust. I have also had the meatball sub. it was good too. Service is good, place is clean."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've ever had. The girl at the front was very nice, I came in on Christmas Eve and said it was my first time. She told me about the specials and the menu and also recommend a \"party on my crust\" which was some romo seasoning. It was fast and yummy. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been looking for some good za for many years in the Falls. Decided to give Marcos a try. I ordered the white cheesy pizza & it was delicious!  The crust & feta cheese were amazing!  A few days later we had some friends over & ordered 2 \"squares \"- a pepperoni & a mushroom. They were awful. The crust was such a disappointment!  We called to find out why the crust was so different from the one we had just two days prior. The manager was defensive & rude. She explained that they have \"classic\" & \"old world\" crust & that we have to be specific!  Who knew?! Not sure I will order from here again."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the full menu, we will definitely be back to try more.  But when the free pizza banner is out, it's really just that.  A free slice of pizza and no gimmicks.  I'll take it.  It's refreshing to have a business do what they say and be so friendly about it.  We got two free slices of pepperoni pizza and I purchased a fountain drink.  The restaurant is very clean and welcoming.  The women's restroom is awesome.  The service was personable and friendly.  And the free pizza was yummy, it reminds me so much of my favorite pizza parlor from my childhood.  Simple and fresh.  I can't wait to come back and try some more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large pizzas for $30 & change. 1 deluxe and 1 pepperoni. Pepperoni was very thin and my kids didn't care for it too much. The deluxe was thick which on the up side is great. I ordered a supreme tho when I called it in and was told their version was a deluxe. Which contains sausage, pepperoni, tons of green bell pepper and onions and a small handful of mushrooms. I asked for cheese sticks and instead received a middle class of little caesars crazy bread. I didn't like it, but two of my kids enjoyed it. The thickness of the bread was satisfying, but overall the flavors are mediocre. 
Customer service is alright. They need to work on it. Phone orders obviously don't have a clear connection because my order was wrong. When I went in to pick up I stood there at the counter waiting for someone. They have more workers than customers in that place and not one was in a hurry to stop running around and help me. I will never take my business back to this place. It's over priced and quality is not their first concern."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and service! The wings are the bomb!! I'll be ordering again (Already have! :) )"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Pricey and fast food quality pizza. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, I order about twice a month , always tip the drivers decently. They totally deserve it. My complaint today is the cooking of my pizza. Why is that I ask for well done it can't for some reason can get done. So I have to finish cooking it. Why is that? 3 times in a row now. I would hate to look for a new place to order pizza , cooked pizza at that"}
{"text":"I like ordering from Marcos rather than the competition because they offer salads and sandwiches in addition to pizzas. It's a good combination for my family."}
{"text":"Ordered the X-large pepperoni pizza and large salad to go. Nothing special but hit the spot. We have leftovers for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Tastes like overpriced Little Caesar's.  Also, 30-45 min at 10:00pm to make a small cheese pizza is ridiculous ! Sorry - won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've eaten Marco's pizza on and off for a few years now. It's very good pizza, it's the kinda of pizza you forget about and when you see one you want to try it again because you had a positive experience, very under the radar for this chain. I'm by a few where I live now and alway promise myself to get some but always delay. The pizza is similar to other chains in style, they do a nice job of bringing the sauce, cheese blend, and crust together to make you want to make a repeat purchase."}
{"text":"I've been ordering my pizza from the same store for months . They decided they would change delivery routes and the closest store to me doesn't deliver to my home anymore . I probably won't ever order from Marcos again not because there foods not good but because of the inconvenience!"}
{"text":"Until I became gluten free, this was our favorite pizza.  This evening we ordered wings, salad and cheese bread (for my husband).  We first tried to placed our order online and the order wouldn't go through.  No problem, we called.  It was 6:00 p.m and were told it would be 10-15 minutes.  30 minutes later the driver called and said he couldn't get in the building.  We don't live in a building.  Still, no problem, wrong address and he said he'd be right over.  15 minutes later, still no food.  We call back and tell the guy taking the orders what happened and blames us for not confirming our address and that the driver is in a different sector delivering other orders.  Now there is a problem.  The order finally shows up over an hour later and the salad was wilted from sitting under hot food and the wings were underdone and just disgusting.  Who doesn't put their chicken wings in a fryer????  It was really awful and I can say that we will not be calling Marcos pizza again anytime soon."}
{"text":"We order allot of pizza from Marco's and there's a reason why. The white chessey is my favorite and all others are great! I've never stepped foot inside the place so this is strictly on a food basis."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to EVER order pizza from. Every time I call to place an order a young lady answers the phone and leaves me on hold. I sit on hold so long I hang up and call back. I am then placed on hold again. This has happened to me at least 6 different times. I will NEVER order food from this place again."}
{"text":"Barely edible.  It would go out of business if not for the movie rental business attached.  Pizza is more like a frozen pizza.  Don't waste your money.  Two better places within a mile.  Yelp it yourself."}
{"text":"I used to like Marco's, maybe I still do but I don't think delivery is the way to go with this location anymore. Tonight's order was suppose to be a free replacement for the order we never got 4 nights ago. It is
now 2 hours after the call was placed and still NO PIZZA. Hubby has driven to Marco's to see about our dinner only to find out our order was in the carry out window...COLD. So now he waits as our order is remade...I appreciate the manager trying to make it right but damn man!"}
{"text":"I order this for the kids because I was too lazy to cook lol, it arrive on time maybe 5 mins earlier I didn't know what to expect. We got an xl pizza with 3 toppings extra cheese and bacon, once I open the box it looked so good I couldn't resist so I had to try some it was actually good and I enjoyed it and also another slice lol I will order here again"}
{"text":"I just had a pizza delivered and I'm so disappointed. I ordered a half veggie/pepperoni and received a greasy and overcooked half cheese/pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Super fresh ingredients and delicious pizza sauce. 

We ordered delivery because we were being super lazy and was told it would take 30-45 minutes. It took a little less than 30 minutes which is awesome! It seems every pizza place you order from in Vegas takes at least 45 minutes to deliver so I was pleasantly surprised. 

The delivery guy was very nice. The food was delicious. Great pizza, yummy cheesy bread and freshly fried boneless chicken wings. Yum! 

Our first order but definitely not our last!"}
{"text":"Have never tried Marcos pizza tonight was the first time . We ordered delivery they were very friendly on the phone when I ordered. I could not order online because I went to their site and it was not working on my iphone5s.They delivered our pizza quite fast which was great. The driver was very friendly and we ordered the supreme it was great and tasted good also ordered a side salad and that too was a good portion overall a good experience for our first time . They got 4 stars due to not being able to order online.."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with their pizza.  Plenty of toppings without the need to ask for extra.  When it comes to pizza what can you really say other than it was good and reasonably prices."}
{"text":"Called my order in on my way to pick up. Didn't have my order at all when I arrived. Had to order it from scratch."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very good but the last 2 times I've ordered pick up here the order hasn't been right. I figured it had been a while since the last incident so i have them another shot. Tonight, I ordered by phone, had the order repeated to me twice, the girl told me 20 mins. I said ok, my fiancée would be picking it up. 30 mins later she arrived and only 1 pizza was ready. Apparently they had \"a problem\" with the order and had to remake one. Asked if she minded waiting 10 mins for it to cook. What choice did she have at this point. Last time I ordered there 1 pizza was wrong and 1 was stone cold. If a customer spends $25 on an order it should be ready and right at pick up time promised!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big Papa Johns fan but after trying Marco's I haven't been back. Marco's is the best chain pizza place I've ever had so if you haven't tried it I highly recommend you give Marco's a shot."}
{"text":"Cheap pizza review. 

So have you ever had one of the 4.99 dollar pizzas.  Whats the point? it will taste like cardboard after about 10 minutes Not even worth the calories. But I guess if all you have is 5$ in your wallet then you don't have much choice.  

I had the crave and saw that Marco's had a $6.99  deal for a large square pizza with one topping.  Peperoni was my choice.  I called and it was ready in 15 minutes. Nice.

Not to much dough, lots of sauce, perfect amount of cheese, good amount of peperoni.  It was really good.  Next time I will ask for them to cook it a bit longer.  This was a much superior pizza than one of those 4.99 deals.  So if you want some cheap za,  scrounge of beg for 2 bucks more. When you don't finish the whole thing you will at least be able to pop this in the oven and reheat it. This pizza was good for 2 people! Perfect for  self induced munchies."}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased with my pizza and wings. My pizza wasn't hot after they told me pick up in 20 min. I live about 5 minutes away from this place so I think my pizza was sitting out on some shelf. The wings I had to ask for extra sauce because it didn't look Buffalo at all. Also the wings were really really tiny. One bite is all it took to clean it up. So my opinion I wasn't to happy with this place and I don't think I would come back. :("}
{"text":"Nobody has reviewed the best Pizza place in East Parma yet?  

Then let me be the 1st to say this is THE place to go if you want good Pizza with flavorful toppings at a great price.  Theyll customize it for you if you ask, and their toppings are fresher than most chains.  The cheesy bread is amazing, and their bacon chicken sub is a steal at $5.  

On top of that, they seem to give out coupons all the time... and not the '50 cents off a large supreme' type of BS that you see from the other chains - we're talking $5 for a great dinner.  

The delivery services are superb, fast and reliable from friendly locals.  

Highly recommend if you wanted a great tasting pizza that didnt cost a fortune."}
{"text":"Got pizza from here tonight for the first time. Was very disappointed. Pizza was stuck to the top off the box, and was so greasy that it was leaking through the bottom of the cardboard. It's going to take some time for me to ever order from here again. I gave two stars because delivery was quick and cheesy bread was good."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza my family and I have ate that is fast casual. It definitely is better than another fast food Pizza chain that offers hot and ready.
We ordered our pizzas to go. I had a coupon for 10% off for new customers. The pepperoni and cheese pizza was loaded with pepperonis and cheese. The combination pizza was plentiful with cheese, pepperoni, sausage and vegetables. The crust was crispy, light and delicious. 
They definitely don't scrimp on toppings. The pizza sauce is yummy--it isn't overwhelming. 
The employees are very friendly and helpful. I was greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and approaching the counter. 
The only issue I had was the manager was standing by the employee who greeted us and I know he heard me tell her I hadn't been there before and I had a 10% off coupon for my first order; the manager didn't say one word to us. A few minutes later he was leaving and as he was filling up his soft drink and taking home a pizza, he only spoke to a young couple with a toddler seated at a table. He ignored us the entire time. 
I thought his behavior was rude and poor customer service.
I may or may not return even though my family and I enjoyed the pizzas."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment decision to eat here. I ordered the meatball plate and it was pretty fantastic. Came out really quick (10 Min). The lady that took my order was pleasant. They have a small seating area that was clean and the menu was easy to navigate. I really only had one complaint and because there are soo many Pizza shops in the Southwest it's prob going to stop me from sitting down and eating there but wont stop me from ordering there. I stopped drinking Sodas like 7 years ago so now all I drink is water, I asked if I could get a cup of water and they do not have that as an option so I asked how much was bottled water and she informed me it was $2.27. My meatballs were $10 bucks. I know its a weird thing to complain about but I really think it would be nice to have a choice if you are going to sit down to eat there that you would be able to get some water that wasn't 25% of your meal price. 

Just for perspective the largest bill I had for a dinner was $780 at Del Friscos and the water was $0. 0% of my bill. The least expensive was 2 ramen noodle (creamy chicken flavor of course) packages with 2 eggs at a total cost of 47 cents. The water for that meal was $0 so 0%. $2.27 for water and no choice for a cup or glass of water just makes me feel a tinge of greed and I hate that feeling of getting nickle and dimed."}
{"text":"The staff at this particular Marco's are of top quality. Friendly and professional. They make the food right and on the odd occasion something is wrong they quickly and conveniently correct it with no fuss, which definitely makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"This place has become my new favorite pizza.  It's always fresh and hot and taste great.  Also the Italian sandwich is awesome.  The wings leave something to be desired but most pizza delivery places sucks a wings.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"No customer service. I clearly see the open sign and hours, fat boy inside see us pull up and locks the door and ignores us. Closed an hour early wow. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times and it's become a favorite. Staff is always friendly and pizza rocks."}
{"text":"Have had a few accuracy issues but Jessica goes out of her way to correct them! She is very friendly and you can tell she cares about the customers satisfaction."}
{"text":"Overall I was satisfied with Marcos pizza, but I certainly wouldn't pay full price for anything here! We ordered 3 mediums, 2 toppings each, for $7.99. My husband thought the cheese on all of them was too stringy, I didn't think it was at all. 

My complaints would be the mushrooms and ham. The mushrooms were definitely not fresh. They must have been canned or something. They were that weird canned mushroom texture and zero flavor. The ham tasted good but it was pretty dry. 

So, I would go back if we had a screaming good coupon but I will never pay full price."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The pizza was really greasy. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium pizzas for delivery at 715pm. I was told 30 minutes. 1 hour later I called to check on the status of my pizza. The response I got was \"sorry it's out for delivery, we got slammed\". I said I should have just came and got it...he said \"you still can\". I'm thinking, but you said it's out for delivery; so I asked if it was still there....the reply was yes it is. So I go get it and he rings me up $32 for 2 medium pizzas. I had to ask if I get a discount for not getting it delivered...they gave me a 50% discount. Here we sit eating cold pizza...which I should not have had to ask to be discounted but not only that it should have been free especially since it had probably been sitting there for 45 minutes and it's cold."}
{"text":"Marco's pizza shares the same building as Family Video.  In fact, when you walk into Family Video you can see an ordering window in their wall that connects to Marco's.  It really is the whole \"pizza and a movie\" idea in action.  

We tried a couple of their pizzas last night, and they were pretty good.  I'd say they are on par with Papa John's,  Definitely better than Pizza Hut, and certainly better than Little Caesar's and Domino's.  Prices were pretty good too.  Two large 14 inch pizzas, one was a specialty, for 23 bucks total.  

Their crusts come with the free option of adding parmesan, roma, or garlic seasonings.  They also have salads, subs, meatball bakes, and the typical cheesy bread sticks. 

With the addition of Marco's, Sun Prairie now has 11 pizza joints.  Why does a town of 30,000 need 11 different pizza places?  They don't.  Domino's, Little Caesar's, and Pizza Hut, you are the weakest link, goodbye!"}
{"text":"Completely awesome pizza! We ordered the White Cheezy pizza-fantastic! And their website is very simple to browse through. Prices are reasonable as well. This is my new delivery place for pizza!"}
{"text":"We have only ordered delivery but it comes fast. We really enjoy the pizzas and breadsticks we have tried. We especially like the thin (cracker) crust with the old school style pepperoni and white sauce. Our delivery drivers have always been friendly. I signed up for the points club they have on their website and like that I'm earning toward free pizza, like a coffee punch card. I also enjoy the coupons sent in the mail."}
{"text":"I order from them a lot and it's always fast and good. They have awesome coupons and deals they send me. The pizza is actually crunchy- which is a relief after all the soggy pizzas I have ordered around Vegas. If you sign up for their email club you get a free cheesy bread, which is delicious. They have seasonings you can put on the crust too. It delivers in 30-40 minutes every time. I would highly recommend this place. The crust is spectacular."}
{"text":"Marco's is great. I love the old-world pepperoni, and how crispy it gets on the pizza! My only complaint is that they sometimes undercook the center of their XL pizzas. Maybe it's something with their oven, cause I never have a problem when I order a M or L. I complained to them once about this, and they were very nice, and offered me a replacement pizza, which was cooked just fine."}
{"text":"Marco's still makes the best pizza in town but they just lost a customer because of some ideod Mark who is probably some kind of manager there (who makes pizzas at the same time lol) 
Here is the story - so i was close by and needed some change. Walked in at Marcos just to ask, the counter girl was super nice and all, said not a problem. Then this guy Mark comes from the back and asks me if i wanna buy anything.. I said no lol just needed some change if possible,  then he says well sir we cant give you change if you are not buying anything?! wtf i said is it a company policy or anything, he says no thats just how it is.. 
Anyways i bought a pizza cause i really needed to break my 100 dollar bill, but to be honest that was my last pizza from them - THANKS to MARK! Ask your bosses to send you to some customer service classes or something before you ruin their business with your attitude! A-h-ol
I am glad they just open a new location on hualapai and desert in, hopefully with better service ;)"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on the reviews. All I can say is it is NOT the best pizza in town.  The sauce is a lite too sweet for my liking.  That being said the rest of the experience was great.  Online ordering was easy. Pickup was on time. Service was great. I would say if you like a sweeter sauce this is pretty good pizza. Just not my favorite."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place for me , I get great deals in the mail and love there sauce on there pizza. I also order there chocolate brownie is big and can feed up to four people. There toppings are fresh to."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered carry out pizza from here several times and have not been disappointed. Tonight my husband ordered carry out Marco's  large deluxe pizza and ordered bar b q wings for me. This is the second time I've gotten their wings. Again they were great. I loved them and my husband loved his pizza. We will keep ordering from them. My husband had ordered on line. Fast and easy to order on line."}
{"text":"Great local place to get pizza. I picked up my order, and their estimated time was accurate. When I picked up my pizza, the box was hot, which is a good thing because that means it was fresh out the oven! 

Long live the classic pepperoni pizza!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST pizza I have tasted so far in Charlotte and I have been here for 6yrs!!!!!!!!
I had the pizza delivered and it came ON TIME and the driver was very nice as well. The pizza was so fresh and good. I can't tell you how good it is you need to get some for yourself.
I also went into the location a couple weeks later and the staff was very nice and also I got my pizza in a timely manner although they were pretty busy.
Good job Marco's.
This is my new go-to spot for pizza!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, first pizza I had in Ohio. Initially I asked for a large half cheese and half veggie...sooo for a plain cheese large is $10 but a veggie pizza is $16.95 sooo for a half cheese and half veggie would be $16.95, that didn't make sense to me so I told them a large plain cheese would be fine. The pizza was good however the size of the pizza was very small to be considered a large, I would even say it was a small, we and my coworkers even had to make sure we check the receipts to make sure they were aware we said large but I guess the large is fairly small. Nevertheless it tastes good."}
{"text":"I often choose Marco's above some other (better) area pizza places because of the online ordering system, which makes it easy to access discounts, place an order, and then know when to pick it up. It works...most of the time. When I went to pick up my latest order, however, the pizza was done, but I had to wait for the cheesy bread to finish.

In general, the pizza is pretty good, but nothing to rave about. The cheesy bread is the highlight for me. Both the pizza and the cheesy bread are on the greasy side, however."}
{"text":"Good pizza, and not in the \"all pizza is good pizza because its pizza\" kind of way. Ample toppings and good crust."}
{"text":"Tried Marco's Pizza shortly after they opened and we have been hooked ever since! We eat Marco's Pizza about once every three weeks now because it is so delicious! We have never had a mediocre pizza from here. Every pizza has been spot on, mouthwatering and down right delicious! Also a shout out to the delivery drivers who not only are prompt, but deliver pipping hot pizza and they are always extremely friendly! Love everything about Marco's Pizza!"}
{"text":"I am visiting a friend in las vegas and I'll say this.
THE PIZZA WAS BOMB!!!!  peperoni jalapeno bacon mmmm mmm and i never heard of this \"crust party\" what the girl on the phone called it.... you can add little toppings to your crust FOR FREE........ a bit expensive but SO GOOD"}
{"text":"I've ordered close to $2000 worth of food between this location and the one in North Charlotte where we used to live.  The pizza is actually pretty good for the price, but the customer service leaves something be desired.  There's about 2 drivers that actually care about their job and the staff at the store, (I always order online), the couple times i've had to call are very short and borderline rude.  Today, I was missing an item from my order and the man at the store had the gall to ask me how I wanted him to handle this today. \"Do you want a credit or have us run it back out to you?\"  \"Please, run it back out to me\" \"K, we'll be there as soon as we can...\" Not sure how to take that, but I didn't find it it very forgiving."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, they are fast and it arrives hot. They have online coupons, crust is great on the pizza's exactly as you order it.  Great for family gatherings as you can wait until everyone is there and order and specify a time and voila it arrives on time!"}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza in Vegas. Make sure to get the cheese bread. It's the best I've ever had and I would probably give 5 stars if I was just reviewing that. And another plus is they always deliver fast and the employees are all pretty nice."}
{"text":"Marcos......how I love you!!! I absolutely love the pizza from here! First off they always say 40 to 50 minutes till delivery and they come in less than 40 it's awesome when you have 3 hungry munchkins at home. The prices and deals are phenomenal especially compared to Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Caesar's!! Yuck!!!!! Costumer service is outstanding, always. Don't want to cook or go out try their pizza!"}
{"text":"They have the best pizza in this town! You can actually taste every ingredient Not salt and grease."}
{"text":"Marcos pizza is an amazing example of how food brings the community together. They generously donated enough food for 90 teachers and staff from Mesquite Elementary during teacher appreciation week. The food was incredibly delicious and we will be frequent diners at this location."}
{"text":"The bread sticks taste like Papa John's but not as good, these are more doughy and taste like artificial cheese. The pizza tastes like Domino's before they made their pizza better. I don't know why anyone would order from here. $24 for cheese bread, large pepperoni, and 2 liter. We didn't eat much of it. Very mediocre, would not order from here again. The only plus was 30 minute delivery, but then again that was on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Good pizza! I love their white cheesy pizza. I'm a sucker for feta. Was disappointed in the canned mushrooms though."}
{"text":"Our pizza was good but it took along time. And it was crispy on the crust on top. And I burnt my mouth and that hurts. And the cheesey bread was better than the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is always hot and fresh. We ordered a three topping large pizza and it was delivered in about 25-30 minutes. Delicious and made how we ordered."}
{"text":"I don't typically weigh my opinion of food of a chain establishment in the same wavelength as that of a standalone kinds. But I felt this one needed its due recognition!

Tried pizza here twice now, Chicken Fresco and Deluxe Uno and both times a take out. Still, the folks were very pleasant and you got the vibe that they actually enjoyed what they were doing (Go to the KFC or Mcdonalds nearby and you'll see what I mean). It makes a positive first impression on you!

The pizza themselves were attractive to begin with. Yes I just called out their \"look\" because it shows the effort put into making it. The crust was pleasantly fresh, airy and well balanced on the crunchiness-doughiness ratio. The ingredients were fresh, and amazingly \"marinated\" for some of the proteins!! The sauce was spot on and the free extra of butter/cheese crust toppings were a bonus!

In the end, I'd say, please keep up the good work you guys are doing as it's better than any pizza hut or dominos I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Glad to discover this gem of a place. The pizzas are delicious. The crust is better then most out there and the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. My personal favorite so far is the steak and mushroom with white sauce."}
{"text":"We typically choose this pizza place which is why I'm really disappointed there was a hard piece of plastic in my piece of pizza, my son could have ended up with it in his mouth. :("}
{"text":"Ok drive all the way to Goodyear for this pizza my mom was raving about...
First, ordered online for pick-up. Was very specific about what I was ordering...gotta say was taken aback by the price...higher then other joints. Would be okay as long as the pizza was good.
Second, got there and had to wait about 10 minutes. Not too bad of a deal since they were good about giving me a drink. Bad thing is when the two pizzas were done one of the pizzas was absolutely wrong. I ordered a vegetable pizza less the feta cheese, and added beef... no beef and of course there was feta cheese. Now they did remake the pizza and gave me the one that was wrong to boot. Homeless guy on the corner certainly was happy about that. Can't say I was impressed with how the pizza looked or even how it taste it. Now I'm not saying it was bad I'm just saying it was impressed for the amount I paid
Okay so I'd like to say that was the end of it but it wasn't. While I was sitting there waiting for the second pizza to be redone I ordered a dessert brownie. Got home and sad to say that the brownie was burnt yep took pictures of that too.
I want to know that I did make this review 3 stars based on the poor girl at the cashier counter who was very apologetic being that the specifics of the pizza we're right on the receipt. I can't say I would be going back and I certainly wouldn't recommend unless you're willing to pay much higher prices for mediocre Pizza."}
{"text":"hi foodies   this is steven from strongsville   sorry a little late  but here it goes i went to here and the pizza  was pretty good ,i never like thier pizza before ,since jackie took it over  wow what a nice difference  ,fresher ingredients better CRUST!!!!!!!!!!! ,she so nice and relly shows she cares  ,at least somebody does  ,and she sold me 25 pizza sauce cont ,since i like the sauce   any  problems  or anthing wrong  go to jackie the new GM"}
{"text":"I'm always a little skeptical about trying a new pizza place. Since Marcos is a chain, I figured it would be a safe bet. We called ahead for carryout and the order was ready when promised. That alone sets it apart from other places in the area. The pizza was fresh and tasty. The crust could've used a little more seasoning and the toppings and cheese came off pretty easily with the first bite. Those are my reasons for not giving it 5 stars, but it is tasty overall."}
{"text":"I watched as this new building was being built and wondered what it was going to be.  So far two food places with a third to come.

I received a flier in the mail with coupons for Marco's and decided to use one of them tonight.  I called and ordered a White Cheezy which is listed under their Specialty Pizza section.  It's topped with 4 kinds of cheese including feta and has  onions, bacon, and garlic butter sauce on top.  I ordered the large which is a 14\" pizza.  The person who took my ordered said it would be about 13 to 15 minutes and I drove the mile and a half to pick up the pie.  It was almost done.

I paid and then brought the pie home.  It was large enough to serve two (cut into 6 slices), and there's one slice left for morning.  This will be my \"hearty meal\" before going to give platelets.

The pizza was good.  It had a taste from the feta that made it different from other pizzas I've gotten.  There was a fair amount of oil on the cardboard box but the pizza itself didn't taste oily.

The restaurant serves other things and they make pizzas that you build the way you want.

This is a national franchise with several locations in Las Vegas.  

Not the best pizza I've had but not bad either."}
{"text":"Take out sucks when the stupid kiddie dance club is open. Rude teenagers don't like to get out of the way and block sidewalk. Every guy hanging out has pants below their butt. They like to hang out at Marcos while waiting for to enter club. Doesnt pay to get carry out or wait hour for delivery. I'll go to Smith road. It's not much farther from my house. Much less hassle."}
{"text":"Waited way too long for pizza (50 mins+) and the pizza was destroyed. The cheese was stuck to the top of the box. You would think that a place that charges 3x more than papa John's would take better care of their product and have more attention to detail."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location now for about 1  1/2 years, and I will break this down in a couple sections to help make the review an easier read. 

Restaurant- So the pizza place is in a little strip mall, and is normal in size relative to most pizza joints. It does have seating both inside, and out. The menu is large enough to read, and very simple to read. The restaurant has always been clean for me, so I have no issues with the inside at all.

Service: I have always done carry-out, so I can't speak to delivery, sorry!! Though for their online site, it's amazingly easy to use. I also have signed up a rewards program with them, and I always get coupons for the pizza. Whether it be 3-7 dollars off my order. With the carryout service, they always open the pizza box to ensure that the pizza falls into your standards, and that makes me feel more comfortable about the quality of products.... Speaking of!

Quality: I believe that Marco's is by far better than most chain pizza places here in AZ. I will go to them before the Papa. The cheese, the meats, everything is just amazing!! They use a three-cheese blend which tastes great. I always get the garlic oil on the crust, which probably is slowly killing me, but I don't care at all. They also serve wings, salads, dessert items, sandwiches, the list literally goes on and on.

Overall: You really need to try this place. They have amazing food, friendly staff, and good deals."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza. Gross! IF they give you what you actually order, you will regret it for a long time thereafter. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the amazing product and fast delivery! We love this place when it comes to pizza on the run!"}
{"text":"Really NOT impressed. I tried this place when a friend recommended it and the pizza was not very great. To top it off the employees kept going in and out of the front door for no reason!!! I'm not talking about leaving for deliveries either! It's annoying when you are sitting by the door (the only table available in the whole place) and it's cold outside. The employees were rude and the pizza was bland. I won't be returning. 

P.s. The in store menu doesn't make any sense. No ice and no lids or straws for the cups."}
{"text":"Ok pizza but not cooked enough for me. Had delivery last night by the pool. The large veggie pizza was ordered with no olives but somehow came loaded with very chewy bacon? The other three pizzas were ok."}
{"text":"I'm so happy my husband found Marco's. We order every 1-2 weeks for pickup. The pizza is amazing, always fresh, order is accurate.

I had one incident where they sliced the pizza super sloppy... but it never happened again."}
{"text":"Have been going to this location for over 3 years and last night was one of the times I wished I would have skipped.
I always get large thin crust meatlovers.
Last night the meat was not evenly on the pie.
Last night edges were burned, not black, but crispy n brown and could taste the burn.
Outside pieces had very little meat n cheese while center was packed.

Hope this is a one n done error or will be looking for new Pizza place in that area."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza was good nice amount of sauce and cheese ratio.Cheese bread wasn't that great no flavor."}
{"text":"I woke up early this morning craving some Zah and instead of waking and baking...I mean, taking a bio break upon waking, I got on Yelp to plan out my Pizza hunt strategy....(please note, I don't smoke the green, just trying to be funny here...)..

After some seriously focused review of research from our Yelpers I finalized my selection to Rosati's on Durango and Warm Springs but decided to wait until I got there to determine whether it was going to be deep dish or thin crust.  It's 7 AM and my day off so I had a protein shake to stave off the hunger driving my salty, chewy, crunchy, spicy desires and did my laundry....

After the final fold, I drove to Rosati's salivating at the prospect of satisfying my carnal urges...sorry, I mean, culinary desires.  I parked and pulled the keys out of the ignition in giddy anticipation of the flavor feast about to ensue in my mouth, dancing with my tongue, and filling my belly, but then, when I pulled the door handle at 1115 AM, it didn't budge.  LOCKED!?  The door was LOCKED!!!  WHAT!?!?!  The tinted glass prohibited my seeing that the store was EMPTY!!!   OH MAANNNN!!!  There was NOTHING in there.  The business was either doing a deep cleaning or didn't make it.  The fantasy dwindles and shrivels as I wondered where to go and what to do.  The only other Pizza palace I like is Rocco's but that's WAYYYY over on the other side of town from here.  I decided pizza could wait for another day and settled on sushi at Sumo's right around the corner on Warm Springs.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed Marco's, pulled out the Droid Incredible and opened up the Yelp app. Found Marco had four reviews and they weren't bad so I saddled up and gave them a go and ho, ho, ho, I'm so happy I did.  Whoa!

As the old saying goes, do not judge this book by it's cover.  Small with three table, I was wondering if the reviews were written by friends of the establishment, but I journeyed forth and stood resolute with the acceptance that this place may let me down like so many others had.   I was the only customer on site as I stepped up to the counter, uncertain as to what I should order.  A nice young lady jogged up to the counter to great me and just as she finished, the phone rang.  She excused herself, answered the phone in a professional manner and asked the person on the phone to hold.  Since I was clueless, I asked her to help the person on the phone.  Whoever was on the phone made a HUGE order of two large, three topping pies, a 20 Wing order, plus two liters of soda.  Things are looking up now.  I ordered the large Deluxe Uno...Chewy melted cheese, peppery pepperoni, savory sausage, REAL mushrooms, great green peppers, crunchy onions and extra cheese...I added green olives and jalapeños, plus I asked them to add the tomatoes and onions raw after the masterpiece has completed it's cooking process.

20 minutes later I was in the car driving home with a 10 pound mound of a fantastic looking pizza.  Hungry as a skinny dog outside a butcher shop, I opened the box and pulled out a slice.  It was hot and heavy!    Misti, I know you have a preference for pizza with a lot of \"stuff\" on it, well Miss, I dare to say, I thought of you while biting into this incredibly satisfying slice.  Perfectly warm, explosive flavors from the tomato sauce, pepperoni, sausage where you taste the anise, the crunch of fresh chopped onions, the chill and texture of ripe tomatoes and the CRUST!!!  Wow, that crust is good.  I don't usually eat the crust without putting some hot sauce on it, but this was good just plain.  Nice crust!

If I were with a group of friends and we wanted pizza, I'd highly suggest Marco's for take out.

On a side note, the bathroom was clean, the driver I encountered said hello to me on his way in and when he left, he said, \"Driver out\" and they responded, \"drive safe!\".  It was cool.

Chow!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza from this place for years.  The guy who I think is the manager treats you like family every time you stop in.  He's not just managing the place, he's back there making the food with the other employees, and setting a good example.  The food is always good too and always on time."}
{"text":"Okay, it's not the best pizza I've ever had, but in an area where chain pizza joints are the only other options, Marco's is the best option.   Seriously cant believe someone said Dominos or Papa Johns were better options - Marco's is much closer to the real thing.  Only reason there arent more stars is that I asked specifically before I ordered their version of Supreme if it had lotsa veggies on it, and then said yes.   All it had was onions and mushrooms.   No olives, or peppers, or nothin.   That was disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE pizza and I really enjoy the non-huge chains like Dominos and Pizza Hut. This place is my favorite place to get pizza in Akron. The cheese breadsticks are also delicious. They have 1 table where you can eat inside, so it's best to order carry-out or delivery."}
{"text":"I have been here for pick up and also had delivery. Hot, fresh, order was corret,  and delivery was fast. No major issues. Would order again."}
{"text":"This place are awesome! Pizza are great for their price and always ready in a timely manner. this is a go-to anytime of the week kind of pizza place. would recommend it to pizza lovers"}
{"text":"My wife likes the thin crust white cheesy pizza which is a good pizza. i also enjoy the pizza from this place as well. It is a little pricey when you order their special pizza but they usually send me good coupons and they have good service. I usually order from this place when i have company and they agree that it is better pizza compared to when I get pizza hut. I ordered both once when I was having a party."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from Marcos was last night and wow the pizza is amazing! The crust is soft and fluffy, huge sized sausage, great amount of toppings and cheesy. I'll definitely be ordering from here whenever I want pizza. Even my kids couldn't get enough and had 3 pieces and that are all under 6 Years old. Best pizza ever! Quick delivery and easy on line ordering also! I recommend anyone and everyone to try Marcos pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Way better than those overly rehearsed pizza recipes from Pizza Hut. I've gone here so many times and they always get my order correct. When I go to pick it up, they have nice workers who opens up the pizza before paying to make sure everything looks good. Also, when they say what time they'll have the pizza ready, they are always ready when they say they are."}
{"text":"4th of July.  It's hot, like Africa hot (Quoting Eugene Morris Jerome of Biloxi Blues), we had been out at the pool all day sunburned and worn slap out.  Did we have stuff to put on the grill, sure.  Did we feel like firing up the grill in 100 Degree heat?  NOPE!  So, we have some coupons that someone left a hanger on my door for this recently opened business and thought that pizza sounded like a good idea.  The hanger coupons didn't give the full story, so I went online and was pleased with what I saw.  Convenient online ordering and the basic \"Dominos\" type pizza menu.  Prices were good and they were offering free Cheesy Bread!  Score.
I decided to call the order in for delivery since I had some special requests.  The lady that answered the phone took a long time to take my order, but she was friendly enough and I attribute it to new, growing pains....no problem.  
Pizza was delivered in about 30 minutes and was correct which is always a plus.  The cheezy bread, I have to say was wonderful.  Soft, doughy and flavorful.  Comparing it to Dominos I would go with Marco's every time.  The pizza was ok, nothing outstanding we ordered the White pizza and it had 4 types of cheese and we opted out of the Feta since I don't think Feta has any business on a pizza, personally.  Onions, tomatoes and we added mushrooms.  The crust was OK, I was unhappy since I found out you can order different crusts looking online but it wasn't offered to me over the phone.  Next time I'd like to try the parmesan brushed crust.
To summarize, Marco's was OK.  I will try it again.  We don't order that much pizza for delivery, but will keep Marco's in the loop."}
{"text":"Normally I am happy with Marco's pizza but today the pizza was the worst.   I order half pepperoni half BBQ chicken but it was 4 slices pepperoni and 5 slices of the BBQ.   The crust was thin on one side and super thick on the other.    I think from now on I will stick with Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak & cheese sub to dine in.  Upon eating the sub it was cold in the middle.  The mushrooms were definately not fresh as they came out of a can.  I probably will not be back for awhile as I would rather spend my money on other quality restaurants in the area.

Other yelpers have stated about the mushrooms which I can confirm.  Very sad when a pizza place does not use fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Good pizza and kind staff. Shoutout to the blonde chicks working night shift. There was a mistake in our order and they immediately remade the pizza and gave us the mistake for free! Not a lot of places would do something like that to accommodate their guests. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here because it was after 10 and the other place I planned to go to had close, I'm so glad! This was some of my favorite pizza now, and I love the breadsticks! I even went back the next day to try another pizza. This is now added to the favorite pizza spots and the customer service is great as well. They were patient when it was my first time, gave me suggestions and was patient while I decided."}
{"text":"This place is just horrible, I don't even know where to begin, the Customer services is just awful when I walk in nobody say hi, so I was like, what a good start slow careless, kids just messing around, a total joke. I don't think that I want to come back to this places, I rather drive a little bit and just go to blaze."}
{"text":"Customer Services is HORRIBLE!
Placed an internet order.I arrived at the time promised in the email. The lady at the counter told me it was just coming out of the oven. In fact, it had not even been started yet. Meanwhile, walk in customers who arrived after me,  were ordering at the counter and  getting their orders before me. Try being HONEST and upfront with your customers, chances are , they will usually understand."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad for delivery and was told it would be delivered in 40 minutes. Since I've place my ordered it's been 1hr and 15 min and still no salad. I called and asked where my salad was and they said we only have 2 delivery drivers. My response to them was then give more realistic delivery times. My salad just showed up and it's hot. The cheese is melted. Like wth."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a local pizza place in my area and this was recommended to me by my uncle. First off, my family is from New York and they are definitely snobs when it comes to pizza! So when I was told I needed to try this place I knew I had to stop in. Let me tell you, it's really good! 

I'm not a fan of thin crusts and prefer a pizza will some substance to it. Their crust is crisp, delicious, and filled with flavor. The pizza itself has just the right amount of sauce, the perfect abundance of cheese, and delicious toppings. Yummy! I ate way more than I should have because it was so good. I forgot to take pictures of the whole pies because everyone was so hungry and dived in right away. Both are XL pizzas and they were huge. I'd say I can actually down size next time and just get two larges unless I have a lot of people to feed. I'm not sure what kind of pepperoni they use but it was exceptionally good! It seriously tastes better than anything I've had around town. 

I did get an order of wings and that is the reason for docking it 1 star because they were just ok. I always get my wings naked with the sauce on the side. Maybe I'm just weird but I prefer a crispier chicken wing and these were a bit on the undercooked side for me. But that is just personal preference because there was nothing wrong with them. 

If you are in the area definitely give them a try. I'll be back for my weekly pizza night."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious pizza! They always have good deals and offers as well. But I don't mind paying full price, well worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza.  I pick up from here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and see them in the neighborhood all the time. So we thought we would give them a shot. I'm glad we did great pizza and good the next day reheated!"}
{"text":"Average pizza. Way to expensive for pizza that's salty and not so great. Not sure if the staff at this location just doesn't care or if all Marco's pizza is not so great. Wish they had better specials and had gluttun free crust."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and cheese bread.  The flavored crust options are great as well.  Price is in line with others.  Food arrives reasonably quick and the drivers are always polite."}
{"text":"Nice little spot on my side of town... I love their meatball bake... food came out fast and hot and delicious.... staff was warm and friendly.... I'm new to Las Vegas and have found me a good pizza spot...."}
{"text":"Very bad service. The staff was very unsure of what they were doing. We were brought our salad without plates and the pizza was not even sliced."}
{"text":"I am from Ohio and we are starting to see more and more Marco's Pizza around us. I love their pizza in Ohio and now I love their pizza in South Carolina. Pizza X3, wings X2, & cheesy bread X2 were all hot and done on time. Staff was very friendly and even helped my carry the order to the car since it was so large. All in all.... a must try if you have never had Marco's and definitely worth getting again if you had."}
{"text":"This is based on their pizza. I ordered takeout and did the order online. It was easy to do and I like how you can check out the specials and modify your order as needed. 

I got a large 5-topping pizza with nothing but extra cheese and meats and boy, was it good! I had the crust flavored with garlic butter and, to be honest, I really couldn't taste it. But the consistency was perfect. The toppings were generous, but I would've liked a little more sauce as I'd requested double sauce. Overall it was really good and I would definitely order there again.

I also ordered the cheesy bread and was highly disappointed. The bread was dry and there wasn't much cheese on it. It would've tasted so much better if it was moister and maybe had some garlic butter baked on it. It came with pizza sauce and ranch sauce for dipping. I'm going to file this under \"Been there, done that\" and I won't try this again.

So, based on the pizza alone, which is what I usually only order anyway, I would say this is above average and I'd recommend you try it."}
{"text":"OK, I'm officially a Marco's whore. Hands-down my favorite take-out/delivery pizza in Cleveland. Now I'm not saying that this is some fancy-schmancy organic whole wheat stuff the (tasty) likes of which can be found at places like Angelo's on the West Side, buuuuut when you're in the mood for quick, tasty, and incredibly unhealthy pizza, this is the place of choice. They recently opened up near my workplace, which is cool, but I may be 50 pounds heavier by this time next year."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is the closest Marco's to my apartment. I would order there more, but that's, like, a three-mile drive to get my Marco's fix. I'm from Toledo, and it's a Toledo-based business, so I'm sure there's some hometown love clouding my judgement here, but it's still my favorite pizza around. 

In actuality, friends have described it as more like the Miller High Life of pizza (or \"The Champagne of Pizza,\" if you will), but I like High LIfe, so they can bite me."}
{"text":"Everytime I call I get put on hold and forgot about . Everytime I go on their website to redeem one of their specials it never works and ends up being 50 dollars for two pizzas. Too many pizza places especially in Vegas to get bad customer service and non user friendly websites . They keep sending me coupons but I'd rather get a pizza somewhere else after always having to deal with this everytime I call or go in or try to use the website . Lost a customer ."}
{"text":"Great pizza we had it delivered and we tried their Pepp Magnifico pizza! Was a great deal!"}
{"text":"Cheap, easy to find and they have coupons but its beat down looking inside and don't think I will be ordering from here anytime soon.  Told me hour and half to deliver down the road.  I'm not like most of the lazy asses who complain about delivery time on here but c'mon guys.  Pizza was 60% dough and wings literally were the size of your pinkie thrown in a big ass box with sauce thrown on.  Nah, I'm good, fam..."}
{"text":"Place never lets me down. Period!! Everything I've ordered from here is very good. Can't go wrong with this place. Delivery time is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We order from here a lot, it's always delicious and hot! They have great online deals. We ordered one pizza and decided to get another one so I ordered a second one online, the employee called me to make sure I wanted another one, which I thought was great customer service!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! 

I imagined Marco's being more like a Sbarro's pizza, but it's definitely not! They use all fresh ingredients and a garlic, cheesy sauce that's brushed on the crust right after they pull the pizza out of the oven- YUM!  AND, it's very well priced. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza ! Real italian sausage not the hunks of ground pork. The 2 topping 2 medium pizza deal keeps us coming back !"}
{"text":"Didn't care for it at all. Pizza was below average and the wings looked microwaved ...."}
{"text":"Got an XL pepperoni. They are right near Stephanie and the freeway. Pizza was decent with the right amount of toppings but flavor is what's keeping me from going higher in a review. The wings were fine too but lacked a crispy skin. There was an all girl kitchen the night I walked in for pick up, they were doing an awesome job."}
{"text":"Tried ordering takeout but they \"couldn't find\" my address so wouldn't take the order. Our address pops up for every delivery service and all our friend's/family's gps but they can't even figure it out. Talk about annoying."}
{"text":"First time trying Marcos out, we had it delivered since I got home late. I order the pepperoni maginfico with cheese bread and  10 wings extra crispy. The pizza was okay, not the best and wings weren't cooked the way I asked for"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst pizza I've ever had in my entire life. The bread was inedible. The toppings were obviously not made themselves. The sauce was very dry. Nothing about this place screams I must have Beth. Worse than dominoes, Jimmy John's, McDonald's, anything."}
{"text":"I like Marco's. It's one of the cheaper options for pizza that still taste good but I was really mad that when I called to place an order at 9:50pm for delivery (an hour and 20 minutes before they closed) instead of placing my order I was talked out of ordering from them because she stated my pizza wouldn't be delivered for an hour."}
{"text":"The customer service kills it for me. Well that and it really is expensive pizza for what you get. I wonder with the new pizza place across the street if they will offer better deals. The old world pizza is greasy but good."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza. Reheats well the next day in the microwave."}
{"text":"Wow! I love Marcos Pizza! Pizza is always hot and tastes great! Their red sauce is very flavorful! The cheese is great and so is the crust! This is one of the better pizza places in Las Vegas! The pick up location is always clean and the people are friendly! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Marco's pizza for the last two decades. They are quite popular in the Midwest where I came from originally too. I've had pretty good experience with pick up orders here - never used their delivery. Their time estimates are usually pretty close, or no more than 5 minutes late. I'm totally ok with my pizza being fresh out of the oven even if I have to wait a few minutes. 

One bit of feedback I do have for this place though, is that they almost always forget the crust topper. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"My parents ordered delivery from Marco's for the family.  We ordered several pizzas, salads and breadsticks.  The delivery was on time and the food arrived hot, always the two best things for a delivery order!  We had the large Garden salad, and it came with lots of fresh veggies, not just lettuce, and plenty of toppings for the whole salad (I.e. not just one tomato).  There were also variety of dressings to choose from.  We had cheese, pepperoni, and mushroom pizzas, you basic standards!  I loved the mushroom, lots of topping and very tasty.  The other pizzas had lots of toppings as well.  I'd definitely recommend this delivery pizza."}
{"text":"Marco's occasionally sends coupons in the mail. One rainy day I decided to use one of the coupons I received in the mail.  Greatest decision!! I ordered a Medium BBQ Chicken pizza and Hawaiian Pizza, totally worth it; with a coupon it was \"Buy one (any size) get the other (same size) free.\"  

Another occasion, I decided to try their pepperoni pizza and now it's officially my favorite place to get pepperoni pizza!  So happy this pizza shop opened in the Southwest.  Love it."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! I could make a book about all the good things about this location!"}
{"text":"Decent but service is below average. My wife is gluten free AND dairy free (horrible for a pizza place) so we go to Marcos because they offer gluten free crust. I can't tell you how many times we have ordered no cheese and gotten cheese on her pizza bc they go into autopilot and don't pay attention. Just two days ago we ordered pizza and they said 15 minutes. I arrived in 20 and they hadn't started my pizza. All my wife gets is crust, sauce, and green olives. It eventually took them 30 minutes to get me my order. I suspect it was because they made the first pizza wrong and had to redo it and didn't say anything..."}
{"text":"I was hosting an event in the salon a few doors down from them with about 30 women in attendance. Marco's Pizza was kind enough to come and introduce themselves to us AND gave my guests and I free boxes of pizza. #NomNom

Not only were the owners pleasant and humble, but the pizza was amazing- my guests LOVED it! 

We will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Super quick delivery and consistently good. I've never actually been into Marco's since we always get it delivered, but their drivers are always prompt and friendly. They were the only pizza place in the area available on Easter, they never let us down!"}
{"text":"Marco's delivers an average pizza. Nothing to get excited about but we order it along with a family size Caesar salad and it works. Delivery guy is friendly and professional. We already have quite a few pizza joints in MH so it will be interesting to see if Marco's has staying power."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's such a low rating for this pizza place because it's good! Better than your Pizza Huts and PaPa John's but not as fancy as your gourmet pizza places in Charlotte like Desano or Inizio. Fresh dough is always used and it shows! Service is always great and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I got a flyer in the mail for Marcos Pizza that just opened a block from our house. I called to order a Pepperoni Melt Large Pizza which is pictured in their flyer. The girl says it's a sub not a pizza. I said I'm looking at the picture on the flyer. She puts me on hold to ask her manager who informs her that she is correct it's a sub not a pizza. I told her to have her manager look at the flyer they are sending locally and she informs me they are a chain so not every location does the same thing. Never tried their pizza and I won't in the future. Horrible advertisement and customer service. 0 stars is what I would give this location."}
{"text":"They have tasty pizza (they do a great thin crust) and have online ordering.  What could be better?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this time the pizza and the sub were very dry and overcooked. I ordered white sauce on my pizza and didn't get any sauce at all. Pizza was way overcooked. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the thin crust, curtious and friendly staff.  I usually stop when I am driving buy and get a pizza pretty fast.  They have good pick up deals"}
{"text":"Tried Marco's for the first time yesterday, and I have to say, it was totally better than Papa Johns, Domino's, and most defiantly Pizza Hut.  Pizza was very tasty, crust was good.   I was surprised.  Only complaint, I put in a \"delayed order\" and I think they made the pizza a little too early.  I will try again by just ordering and picking it up. Overall very good pizza."}
{"text":"Moved to Indian Land and had no Pizza Hut close by, so I gave Marco's a try. I order a pepperoni pie and a sausage pie online. You can actually choose between a few different spices or cheese to be sprinkled onto the outside crust edge! Also, you can add a dipping sauce for free. So different than what I was use to. I must say, I enjoyed them. Delivery time was normal, around 30 min. (Usually close to under). 

Second Visit: My wife wanted to try a cheese pizza because that's her favorite kind. (I normally don't care for chees/regular pizza) Folks I'm here to tell you the double cheese pizza is NOT a joke!! That is some damn fine cheese pizza! Also, the cheesy bread was decent and the cinnamon bread is durn good too!

Overall, this is a great place for delivery. Haven't gone in and sat down to eat, but I'm sure the quality is just as good. Price is very fair too! Good deals to be had online!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

We got delivery, which was extremely fast. The pizza was actually too hot to eat at first. 

Both pizzas were amazing! They did everything perfect. Cheese, topping, sauces and crusts. 

Will definitely be ordering more"}
{"text":"My favorite pepperoni pizza.  Conveniently located n cut to Lee's liquor store if you pick it up. I usually have it delivered.  Never takes more than 45 minutes al as hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted pizza tonight but didn't feel like driving to go get it. I checked yelp and saw all the great reviews and fast delivery. It was music to my ears. The pizza is REALLY good. Probably some of the best I've had in a while. The delivery was fast and my family and I are stuffing our faces as I write this. I'm definitely going again!"}
{"text":"This is now my family's and I new favorite pizza in town. The pizza is delicious and their wings are so flavorful, even their crust is really good. Great customer service needless to say we will now be regulars here."}
{"text":"Received a pizza with a hair in it via a delivery order. Called and received a credit for a replacement pizza. Tried to order a replacement pizza a week later and was told that they could not send a replacement pizza because the order did not cost $15.  The pizza's value was over that amount originally. I was going to tip the driver $5 as usual. I have been using this location since it originally opened. This location seems to be going down hill lately."}
{"text":"They updated their website have a hard time ordering anymore cant add things to my cart. That's happened twice including just now and I ordered from other places  they're ordering system never was good online they don't say that price next to most things until you add them in the cart and now you can not even order double toppings after they redid their website"}
{"text":"Always awesome!!!! Delivery is fast and customer service is amazing! Foord is always hot and great!"}
{"text":"We just ordered a Deluxe pizza with original crust. Added crust toppers - Garlic butter, Parmesan Cheese and Roma seasoning, had it delivered and it's delicious! They get a five star for taste, flavor, and freshness. Crust is delicious. Lots of ingredients on top."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Marco's pizza, but the Marco's pizza in Stow, OH, is not deserving of their good name. I ordered a pizza about 6 months ago and it was WAY too overdone with very little sauce. The pizza I ordered today was cooked properly, but it had lots of big areas missing cheese and very little sauce again. A real shame. Hopefully Marco's is still good elsewhere. I created a yelp account for the sole purpose of posting this review. Do yourself an epic solid and go to Luca's right down the road."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I hate ordering out. I try as hard as I can to avoid anything greasy and cook as much as possible but being a new mom to a newborn those days are slowly disappearing.

Earlier this week I had way too long of a day and dinner was not happening, so I had my husband stop to pick up pizza. Being new to the area we weren't really sure where to go (trying to avoid places like Pizza Hut-ugh) I turned to Yelp and found that Marco's was just down the street. Long story short, best delivery pizza. It literally tasted like it was made fresh at home - NOT a greasy box of cheese. The prices are a little steep for the size of the pizza but after tasting the freshness of the ingredients, so worth it. Found our new delivery spot! :)"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza!  Everything here is real good EXCEPT the customer service. The customer service was great before now it seems you're doing them a favor by ordering from them. They have become very rude, very impatient with customers. I only order delivery. I can\"t imagine if I walked into this place and ate there. 
Remember MARCO\"s we the customers make your business thrive. Find better employees or we will not eat here any longer."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza, ordered  a supreme  pizza  and they gave me a meat lovers. The employer didn't  care that we got the wrong pizza."}
{"text":"awful service, they refused to deliver to a friend of mine who just had a baby, because i wasn't there with my credit card, even though i called before delivery and nothing was said except about if i wanted to tip it had to be on the card and be present for the tip.
Its ridiculous they paid there driver to deliver an order and bring it back because i wasn't present, even if they called to get verification it wouldn't matter, apparently they don't need any business. Very unhappy"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday it was so bad after 2 pieces I threw the rest in the trash. The sauce was bland the pizza in all had a weird taste and the cheese was like rubber. Just one person's opinion.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Tried Marco' s pizza for the first time today. We ordered an XL \"cheesy white\" and a meatball bake. The food was average at best. I enjoyed the meatball bake more than the pizza, but even then, it was nothing spectacular. Food was cooked properly, however, the flavor wasn't what I was expecting. I may give them another try, since people seem to love Marco's....but will have to order something else."}
{"text":"What a surprise! I received a coupon on my door a while back and finally decided to order. I got the white cheesy pizza and an order of hot wings. The guy on the phone was super nice and gave my an ETA of 30 to 45 minutes. Within 27 minutes the delivery guy was here. I mentioned they must be slow but he said they were actually busy but it was quick cause I'm right around the corner. At first glance the wings looked unimpressive and they were. They're super slimy and there's hardly any meat. The pizza on the other hand is AMAZING! It's the only pizza I've had that's not greasy and the crust is so good. Even their ranch is good and I'm weird picky about ranch. The pizza did look like it was cut by a newbie but that was easy to ignore with how delicious this pizza is. I'll definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"we love marcos we order online it arrives usually in 30 mins. friendly staff and they are open late for people like us who order late usually"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, these people are THE BEST!  I called from Detroit to order my sister a pizza.   I'd asked them to make sure everything was okay over there... she's older and they called back after they were there and let me know.  
The food here is super good and we won't order from anywhere else."}
{"text":"My favorite carryout pizza place. They are always quick with the food and generous with the toppings. Favorite by far is their gluten free cheese pizza, not only does is taste good but the whole pizza (medium) is under a thousand calories. Comfort food that doesn't make you feel terrible the next day."}
{"text":"Ordered Marcos Pizza for the first time tonight. All three of us give it 5 stars! Love the thin crust pizza and all the toppings were plentiful. Daughter loved her thin crust white pizza and their cheesy garlic bread was amazing. Want to try their wings and sandwiches next. So excited to have our great new pizza place so close for easy delivery. Also, shout-out to Anne at Marcos for helping me through my order."}
{"text":"Second time at Marco's picking up lunch to take to work at second shift job. Got our free cheezy bread, XL Hawaiian Chix pizza, small meatball sub & small Chicken Club sub. All items were delicious and hot. There were so many meatballs on the small sub that we were surprised there was any room for the sauce & cheese, but there was plenty of that as well."}
{"text":"Not gonna rock your socks off, but a decent choice.  If you're too lazy to leave the house, definitely one of the best delivery options in the Rhodes Ranch area.  

Sauce is fresh tasting, and a good semi-sweet flavor.  Toppings are good quality but a little on the skimpy side.  The thin crust is the super thin cracker kind (which I like - just clarifying since some other local places' thin crust is not very thin).  The \"roma\" crust sprinkle is too salty, but the parmesan crust was good.  Delivery was super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Marco's isn't gormet pizza, but it is a damn good pie for the price. The ingredients are always fresh, and the crust is always crispy. Nine times out of ten when I want pizza delivered, I call Marco's. They never disappoint. Try their Subs too!"}
{"text":"Totally unacceptable delivery service! Will never order from them again. We ordered one large specialty pizza at 6:00 pm. It is now 8:00 pm. The person answering the store phone has been telling me the driver is 10 minutes away for the past hour.  She refuses to put the store manager on the phone.  Her response is, \"We're too busy right now\".  My request was to cancel the order and refund my credit card.  I am in total disbelief! Marco Pizza should be ashamed to treat a customer in this manner!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but very pricey. Last time my fiancé came here he pretty much wanted every topping that's on a supreme pizza so he had told the cashier and instead of ringing him up for a supreme or even offering it she charged him separate for each topping and the medium pizza came to like 20 something dollars for one pizza. ( he doesn't ask questions as you can tell) as for me, I was pissed when I found out they had an actual supreme pizza. Sucky service"}
{"text":"Our favorite delivery pizza in Sun Prairie. Wings are meh. Get the Old World Pepperoni instead of the regular pepperoni."}
{"text":"I use to work here and it's by far the worst pizza shop in town they even have rats, yes rats! Well anyways the manager is so rude never ever helps and then blames everything on other people.  They don't date there for and I got fired because I stood up for myself, telling them the truth that the g. M.  Is not a good g. M.  She would only schedule one person in the day with all this business and then get mad about.  Let me tell you folks never eat here I'm not saying this cause I got fired for bullshit I'm saying it cause the place has mold and rats running around trust me you will get sick"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Marcos since this location opened. Awesome and friendly staff and always delicious and fresh. Love that you can customize your oder down to the amount that of sauce and type if dough. The chicken pizza with tomatoes and bacon is my favorite thing to order. I always pick up since it's so fast so I can't rate the delivery. Seriously... what are you waiting for? Order online is super easy too!"}
{"text":"If I could give Marcos on Bermuda 10 stars I would!!! Hands down, the best pizza in Vegas!!! I highly recommend the thin crust pizza with cheddar/mozarella mix, the old world pepperoni, and garlic butter crust! Omg!! I think I may need to order another one!!!"}
{"text":"The latest addition to the Mint Hill pizza scene - which is a bit odd, I must admit, as Mint Hill is not a large area, but we have an abundance of pizza places - is Marco's. A midwest-style pie (think Little Caesars), and also featured recently on Undercover Boss, perhaps to tout the Mint Hill store opening, they also had a \"friends and family\" event to give away free slices to the community - and they opened on Super Bowl Sunday. Bit weekend, to be sure.

It took them a while to get this store open - it seems like their signage has been up for months, but the inside activity did not get moving until the last few weeks. In fact, the nearby Zaxby's started and was built almost in its entirety since the signs went up for Marco's, which is odd because that is a free-standing building, where this is one of the outparcels for the Publix, and they've been here for a while. Maybe the rapid expansion plans for Marco's meant that they were simply waiting for staff to get to the rollout.

As to the store: It's a decent layout, but probably not terribly welcoming if you want to eat inside - you can do it, but it's more of a fast-food place than anything,so while it looks nice, you don't want to spend a lot of time there. Perhaps better to pick up you pizza and head out. Because of that, I'm not sure why there is a bunch of time on the interior. Instead, you may want to just get delivery (or pick up and go).

Staff is friendly, and the pies themselves are good, but not great. Because of the not-too-thin, not-too-thick crust, it's a bit of an acquired taste. The good news is that they are generally done fairly well. Sometimes those can be underdone, but Marco's seems to do a good job at getting everything cooked correctly.

The winner here is actually their cheese - although it's a bit greasy for my taste. The other toppings we tried just came in a bit bland."}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE everytime I call to order and the people that answer the phone they are rude.  I rec'd a coupon saying we missed you from the owner tried to use it and called and got Kayla forget it not worth the run around or the attitude. I will go somewhere where they actually want the business.  I ask for Pam the owner to call me a month ago and the night manager refused to even give her the messenger.  Will be the last time I attempt to give them any business."}
{"text":"This place is right by our house and me and my fiancé frequently eat pizza so finding a good pizza place nearby seemed like a priority to us. We tried Marco's, and loved it! We had the Philly cheese steak (I think that was a special of the month or something), white cheezy, chicken fresco and Deluxe Uno. They have all been great. These guys used the freshest ingredients and their doughs are delicious too! I love garlic flavored crust (Jet's has spoiled us) and these guys have the option of adding garlic butter to the crust. Delicious!
You can also order online at marcos.com and they offer delivery within a certain radius.
The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the limited pizza menu."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but I prefer it over Domino's, Pizza Hut, Pizza Pit, and other such pizza chains. I have no problem with their crust. I think it's better than what Pizza Hut has been putting out for the last thirty years. Topping selection isn't great, but at least it's focused like the rest of the menu. If you want to throw everything and the kitchen sink on your pizza, you might want to look elsewhere.

Got a salad one time. It was as good as you expect from this sort of place, i.e. a pile of lettuce with what amounts to pizza toppings. I will say the service here seems a step above certain other chains. As in, the employees don't look so angry and depressed. Their service for both carryout and delivery has been pretty good in my experience. Overall, this has become my go-to pizza place for cheap pies, especially when they're cheaper than Pizza Hut or Dominos, even without using a coupon."}
{"text":"Delivery guy brought us the wrong pizza. So we called to get the right pizza delivered. My son ate some of the first pizza since we waited another hour and a half for the second one. When the delivery guy brought the correct pizza, he asked for the first pizza they brought and said his manager requested him to bring it back to the store. I was shocked, the manager is just going to throw it out. Worst customer service I have experienced in a long time. Needless to say this place will never get another dollar of my money"}
{"text":"Sooooo delish!! My pizza was perfectly well baked :)..the Greek salad was fresh ..first timer! loved it !"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza!!!  We've settled on the New Yorker... It's the best.  The only thing I don't like are the wings, and I generally love wings.  I have ordered them well baked and extra well baked and they just seem too moist to me.  I do not like soggy wings!!  So we quit ordering wings but order pizza every week.  Best in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordering from online to be delivered from our hotel. 

First off, website not super user friendly.

Order had 80 min delivery time... For pizza? Okay whatever.  Offer comes, no pizza!!! 

3 bottles of water and no iced tea or Dr. Pepper. 

Called restaurant to get order clarification and the guy said we didn't pick a pizza size so he didn't send it. Uh, then why not call???!! You have the number to make an order.

Wish we checked Yelp first :/"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this pizza place.  Way better than Dominos/Pizza Hut and pretty good prices. Especially if you use a coupon! 

We've had the classic crust both times and their cheezybread. The cheezybread doesn't have too much cheese and a nice blend of seasoning on top, so good dipped in the marinara. The blue cheese is a little too fake. We made our own 2 topping pizzas both times we ordered. A good amount of toppings...too much cheese for my taste but my husband loved it. Not really a bad problem to have. 

We live close enough that we ordered and picked up. Both times the pizza was just coming out of the oven when we got their to pick it up so it was piping hot and perfect when we got home. The staff has always been attentive and super friendly. 

Overall a pretty good pizza place and our go-to when we want pizza that won't break the bank. Try it out. I think you'll be surprised too."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Have ordered twice online for delivery, and it never shows up. Good pizza if you can actually get it."}
{"text":"Five stars 
We are here bowling at nationals from California and ordered from Marcos. Sheffield 
They are kind and generous and their pizza is awesome. The breadsticks and cinna sticks are very delicious. We will def be back. 
Thanks again

{"text":"Hands down Marco's in mint Hill is the best pizza I've eaten and my daughter who has been to Italy says it's the best she's eaten in the US    so this is the best pizza short of flying to Rome      we've been twice now and have come away both times very impressed"}
{"text":"You know, this particular Marco's with owner Don and a so-pleasant a staff is a complete 180 from the restaurant I visited yesterday and about whom I gave the only \"1\" (bad review) I've ever given.  Anyway, I have never had such good \"pizza-chain\" food (all individually owned).  Here it's consistent and delicious - and I haven't even had a pizza yet, as I only do pizza on special splurge days.  
I got a salad a week ago and it was a little different from the one I had ordered.  Called Don about it, and he gave me a free ticket for the salad I wanted.  This man knows his biz and his customers.  Can't wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times and I've thought the pizza was pretty good. I had ordered those times just pepperoni and simple stuff like that. Tonight however was different. Laura looked on the menu and ordered a specialty half Uno Deluxe and half Chicken BBQ. I was starving and when I saw that pizza box open up I was not let down when I bit into that deluxe. At that moment I quite literally felt it was best piece of pizza I have had in years. The sausage was so good. I then continued eating and ate a piece of the chicken bar BBQ. I knew at that moment I would be writing a review later. High quality and great customer service. Thank you Caleb and team!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite pizza place. 
If you order a pizza without cheese (hello dairy allergy people like me) they can cover it in spinach and your fave toppings and you have a safe and delicious alternative to certain household name pizzas that aren't allergy friendly. Plus! When you get toppings at Marco's they really give good amounts of toppings. If you order spinach they cover the pizza it's not just some pitiful teeny pinch of spinach leaves. Ah I love the way they add their toppings. THIS. IS. GOOD. PIZZA."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here. I was pleasantly surprised with the cheesy bread. It was warm and fluffy and covered with tastiness. I used an online coupon and got two medium one topping pizzas. Upon arrival they looked great. Extremely fresh and the cheese was gooey. Sadly, with ear piece that was removed there was a pool of grease sitting underneath. Definitely made for a strange taste. Overall the meal was decent but I would recommend that they look into trying to make the pizza crust less greasy"}
{"text":"High priced an mediocre maybe it was a bad night but idk maybe I'll give it a shot again. It's close an I wanted pizza"}
{"text":"I am a self-avowed  'pizza snob', and over the years have had the very best pizzas in NYC, Jersey, Chicago, Italy, and many other places on this small corner of the universe.  I always thought Marco's to be one of the better pizza chains in NE Ohio (i've ordered their regular crust pie from time to time), but I wasn't prepared for how truly great their thin crust pizza is, upon trying it for the first time!  I recently ordered a large pepperoni and a large cheese (plain) thin crust pizza, and was 'blown away' at the overall taste, balance,  and consistency!  I would rate this pizza at least 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Marco's got 2 stars based on the excellent customer service, appropriate wait time, and the fact that the pizza was hot. Aside from that I cannot see any reason to return. The pizza was so greasy it squished when I bit into it. The flavor was not good. It tasted like processed ingredients on par with Little Caesars. I didn't finish my pieces. I ended up getting something else for lunch. We won't be returning. 

For those pizza snobs and connoisseurs, look elsewhere. For the college kid on a budget, still look elsewhere. I think there are many other equally cheap and tastier options out there."}
{"text":"A very well trained and friendly staff and the pizza is delicious. I am never disappointed when I go to Marcos. The Huntersville location is right across the st from my house so it doesnt get any better! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"This has been our pizza joint of choice for 6 months now! You can't beat the quality of pizza for the price. There are definitely other better tasting pizza places in the Henderson and Las Vegas area but they tend to be more expensive. And to top it off, this restaurant has quick delivery service and great customer service!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take-out from this location numerous times over the years. The food is always good, however the customer service is lacking. Often it seems as though you are an inconvenience to the staff, even when you were just coming in to pick up a pizza with no special requests. The last couple times we have gone, the service has definitely been better so maybe things are changing."}
{"text":"Marco's pizza is the most horrible's pizza I have ever had I have all teenagers and they won't even touch the pizza it was greasy nasty and the worst part of it all is they have terrible customer service I called to try to get a refund they will not give a refund I would never ever recommend this place to anybody because if you don't like the pizza you're screwed The only thing they will offer you is more horrible pizza their wings are very gross and soggy and no sauce their cheese bread is as hard as a rock if you want to break it to then order the cheese bread all I can say is don't ever order pizza from them if I could read this place lower than no stars I would don't ever eat there horrible horrible pizza and horrible horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Very mixed emotion here.  Pies aren't cheap here.  Even with some of their deals, it's impossible to get a free cheesy bread with a regular order.  I thought I would do it two separate orders like I did before.  It wasn't a problem.  We kept getting these free cheesy bread in the mail, which made me think of ordering from here.  Just there wasn't a code of enter in the free cheesy bread so when I went to go pick up and to make another order.  The guy was cool about it but the girl snapped and said I can't combine discount.  She handled the flyer back to me and I said, I guess I won't be able to ever use that.  I told her she can toss it out. 
In my mind, I won't be coming back here.  Technically it's not combine, if it's a new order I'm placing in store.  Come on now, I just paid $29 for 2 pies.  Give me the dang free cheesy bread that's $5.  

A few of the delivery guys seems to care about customer service greeted me when I walked in and yelled at them in the back, \"Customer is here up front!\"  Other than that everyone else is just hanging out not to acknowledge or care what's going on. 

The first two times I ordered from here was last year during the summer.  I live about .5 miles from this location.  I don't understand why it took them more than 50 minutes to delivery and it was kind of warm.   Than about 2 weeks later I did an order for pick up to get our food quicker.  Other than the garlic crust they do that I really like, that's about it."}
{"text":"If you like semi warm tasty pizza this your place. My pizza arrived the driver sat in vehicle about 5 minutes until I finally had to get up off porch and flag him down. My place is very well marked. We paid on-line with A credit card. Driver did not have a pen. I had to go inside and find a pen to sign the slip. As a delivery driver  it seems you would want to be efficient. Such as having a pen for a known Credit Card slip.
My pizza was was at best semi warm. Slightly askew in box. Actually looked like it was dropped. I went and  look at my cinnamon sticks those were hot yet no icing was included. 
I called backed and told them I had no icing. They did immediately sent someone out with icing 25 minutes later. This driver also called from parking lot asking about apartment.
Neither driver even attempted to get out and look for apartment.
I had a delivery job in the past. I would only call as a last resort after walking up to building not before even getting out of car.
I have tried this place a few times and had issues all except once.
This was my last time. Never again!!!!!! 
I have many choices and will choose another next time!"}
{"text":"So glad to have a Marco's near here now. I missed Marco's pizza so much when I moved from the east side.

This place is reasonably priced, there are always deals and coupons, they deliver. Our first order was a bit wrong but they gave us a credit when we called with out argument, and our second order was perfect. They have feta cheese,  YUM! one of the best chain pizza places."}
{"text":"First time ever tried this place out in Vegas. By far, this is one of the best pizzas I had. This place is way better then papa John's, Dominos or even Costco's pizza back home in Hawaii. The pizza sauce is not too saucy but just enough sauce. The cheese is very cheesy! The sausage is way bigger than the ones back in Hawaii. They also use two different types of pepperoni for your pizza. This place is seriously a must try!"}
{"text":"Huge pizza fan and nothing since round table in CA has impressed me with the white sauce. The pizza maybe smaller then I expected but then again, maybe I was just starving. It came in half the time I ordered and I most certainly will order again! Perfect amount of toppings, excellent flavors. The driver was very kind, patient even when I didn't know which house I was exactly in by looks because I just moved here!"}
{"text":"Stated 45-50 minute delivery time.  Hour and a half later I got a call telling me they gave my food to someone else and would of course refund me, but no offer to remake my food and deliver it.  Never again.  Don't order if you want your food actually delivered."}
{"text":"Pizza  is consistently good from this chain.  Prices are reasonable, too.  We ordered several pizzas for a birthday party and they kindly delivered them to the CH Community Center, although it is technically outside of their delivery range.
They are always on time and you're never left wondering where your food is.  Always google for a coupon code!  Wings are good, as well.
Employees are nice and well-spoken.  Delivery driver is always courteous."}
{"text":"I order from this place a lot. The food is always hot and delicious. The delivery is speedy and friendly. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I love this pizza but this is the second time in 2 months that pizza came squished to one side of the box.  I called the first time to let them know that their delivery people might be taking corners too fast. This time I didn't call. Pizza took 55 minutes to get here and it was just lukewarm. I think it might have been forgotten and when I called to see where it was, was quickly delivered. 
Just very disappointing."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars. It's sad bc I would have loved to give them more. However, despite their delicious pizza, the girls I spoke with in the store tonight had TERRIBLE attitudes. Apparently they have recently changed the hours and they close at 10 instead of 11 now (but the yelp/map for iPhone hasn't changed the times). I called at 9:50 and was told \"we're closed\". As annoying as it is to have a customer call that close to the closing time and order, if you're open til 10, YOURE OPEN UNTIL 10. Then the worker (Jacqueline) HUNG UP ON ME. I called back and spoke with the MOD (Lauren) who told me they weren't taking orders because they shut the ovens down because they hadn't an order in over 45 minutes... I will be calling to speak to the owner tomorrow to let him know that it's not good business practices and it's definitely terrible customer service to hang up on a potential customer. did I mention I was a POTENTIAL customer?! Won't be calling back there to place an order again... Ugh."}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza a few times, and every time it's delicious. Prices with coupons aren't bad, unless you require mountains of toppings. Pizzas come out quick with crispy crusts. It's a good standard pizza place."}
{"text":"We were hungover and tired.. Did not want to leave the house so delivery was the only option.. Only problem was that it was 9:30am.. We tried a couple places but no luck and then we stumbled upon Marco's.. A VERY nice lady picked up the phone and took our order she let us know that their delivery guy doesn't come in until 10:30 so we would get our food at 10:40.

He was right on time with our food..! 
-Chicken Poppers: Were soft and tasty but comparable to any other fast food joint..
-Cheesy Bread: Comes with marinara sauce.. Basically tastes like garlic bread with cheese = YUM
-Greek Salad: I was impressed with the fresh ingredients they used in their salad and they don't use cheap ice berg lettuce so ++++++"}
{"text":"This is a poor excuse for a pizza place. Even in an area dominated by chains you'd expect better.
Their website is not user friendly but if you try to order over the phone the staff gets an attitude. Once you finally get your order in prepare to be disappointed yet again.  Our pie had no taste except dough and not very good dough at that.
Fortunately we have lots of better places to get our pizza fix from."}
{"text":"Pretty Tasty. For some reason, the pizza here tastes 1000%  better than the other location at George Liles Pkwy."}
{"text":"For a chain, this is superior pizza. Blows away dominoes and papa johns. And they're cheaper too. of course I am NOT comparing these guys to any mom n pop place. this is strictly four star for a chain pizza place. which is it."}
{"text":"This pizza is the best by far! I really like this location and great customer service! Continue to keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for the past 3 years since I moved here. I've tried other Marco's location but this location has always got my order right and I always get the get customer service."}
{"text":"Marcos is in an area  (mint hill ) where there is no shortage of pizza chains,  what makes this place different?  
Nothing as far as I know.  Many people here have criticized the service,  I frankly got a decent server.  What I disliked was the pizza,  crust was chewy as if undercooked.  How can a pizza place go wrong with a pizza guys.
I don't think i will go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few weeks ago and I'm disappointed. The person taking the order on the phone failed to confirm my address and the poor girl took a little longer than expected to deliver my order. I didn't pick up when she called because I didn't recognize the number. Hopefully in the future Marcos can integrate a system where the drivers can use a common number or maybe give the customers the drivers area code if its different at least.
The girl was very sweet and apologized profusely but I knew it wasn't her fault, but the person who took my order. I know it can get busy and I love the pizza here, but things like address for a delivery are obviously very important."}
{"text":"We love Marco's! Way better than any other take out pizza chain. We love the old world pepperoni and the cheesy bread is amazing!! They send coupons to their loyal guests which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza but I don't know what's going on with the delivery. I ordered 90 minutes ago and I'm still waiting. And it's lunch time. I called when it hit the hour mark and asked for an update. I was told the pizza was waiting for the driver to come back and pick it up. And I'm still waiting. When we first moved to Mt Holly their time quotes were always much longer than the actual delivery time. Talk about a big shift for the worse!"}
{"text":"Came on grand opening day and ordered a large one topping pizza for $8.99. the breading was a bit chewy but the sauce was good and it had a ton of cheese. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. The restaurant itself was impeccably clean. I work in food service and always check this out when in a restaurant, and even I was impressed. I definitely recommend this place- we wish we had one closer to our house!

Took the kids here because the same, boring chain pizza places can get really old. We went here and it didn't disappoint!  A trendy dining space with room to dine, was unexpected and turned out great for the kids. 

In addition to the phenomenal pizza, we picked up a Cinna-Squares and a Double Chocolate Brownie for the fam to share and they were both great as well. Only regret was not getting the cheesy-bread.  I saw someone pick it up and it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Over priced and gross. Quick delivery doesn't save you from the nastiness that is their pizza."}
{"text":"This place will always be my first choice of the typical pizza choices. Blows away PH for sure. It's not as greasy as those other places. They may be a little more $ but it's worth it at every level. Pizza tastes great, quality ingredients. Always great customer service too. I've been coming here for 3 years & never had a bad pizza or experience. I've only had the original crust but hear they have others to choose from too."}
{"text":"A big thank you to Marco's pizza for hosting the Campo Verde Freshman baseball team on Tuesday evening. The staff were friendly and did a great job accommodating a large group that included teenagers who could devour a pizza almost as quick as it was placed on the table.  Great cheesy bread.  Sausage on pizza was tasty.  Thanks again for a nice end of the season celebration!"}
{"text":"Very upset at first BUT THEN!...Ordered 2 large pizzas(one specialty and one regular) with 4 ranch. The person I ordered it from said 30 minutes which was accurate by 2 minutes. When it arrived my husband set it down on the stove. 10 minutes later we went to get our kids pizza when opening the first box we noticed the ranch was put inside the hot pizza box..with the ranch exploding all over the pizza. 

We called and informed them of there delivery drivers incompetence of doing? this instead of putting it on top of the box. The manager had our order remade and delivered to us within 20 minutes. If the person that ORIGINALLY delivered the pizza would have done so I would have gave them 5 stars for excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Got the crust with all three of their seasonings as recommended on yelp. Pretty good price and they are consistent with delivery times. The cheese bread doesn't come with dipping sauce so make sure you ask for it."}
{"text":"Very stingy with the cheese. I like the sauce and crust is good, but they treat cheese as if this stuff is gold. Every 5-6 months we give them a try, hoping things have got better, but every time we're disappointed. Any concerns voiced to their headquarters is completely ignored. In contrast we once had a concern with Blaze Pizza down the street. They made things right really fast. And their pizza is better--all the cheese you want! Theres so many better choices in the neighborhood, why bother with Marcos? Hopefully this time we learned our lesson once and for all. 

UPDATE: (5/14/18) I've grown to really hate this company. I had at one time, before Marcos went downhill, signed up for Marcos emails to receive coupons and such. Lately I've been BOMBED with literally hundreds of emails from Marcos about their rewards program. Just endless spamming. I went to their web site to get them to stop and--true to form--they never bothered to reply. DO NOT sign up for their emails."}
{"text":"Horrible wings, no meat. Horrible pizza, overcooked and hardly any sauce. Wings are advertised as being super meaty. Not true."}
{"text":"Hands-down, the best pizza in the area.  We always order delivery and are told 40-50 minutes, but the longest it's ever taken is 25 minutes.  They get the order right every time.  (If I could change one thing they'd be using fresh mushrooms instead of canned, but the owners get to make the rules.)  I love that their website tells us when the pizza leaves their shop for our door!

Once every couple of years we try a different place, but after one bite of someone else's pizza it's back to Marco's for us."}
{"text":"Marco's is my go-to pizza joint. I know that some people have attitude because it's a chain pizza place but the pizza is always good and they have really great customer service. In fact, their evening counter guy has some of the best customer service skills I've ever seen anywhere. He is so personable and goes above and beyond what is expected of him.

I usually order the same thing every time - large pepperoni pizza with half green pepper well done with light sauce plus cheesy bread. They never get it wrong and are always happy to accommodate any special requests. I also love their garlic dipping sauce and we always order extra. 

When it comes to pizza, Marco's gets it right every time without fail."}
{"text":"Pizza is great and the proximity to our home is also wonderful. The kid(s) working there seem nice but could use a little personality. Ordering by phone wasn't as easy as other places. The order was incorrectly taken when I arrived to Pick up. That may had just been the employee(s) lack of employment experience. Likely his first job. Other than that place is great. Four stars"}
{"text":"After taking a few years off due to terrible delivery and food quality issues, we decided to give them another try, this time with takeout. We gave them an extra 10 minutes before going to pick the food up, and still waited over 10 minutes in the lobby before even being greeted, and they didn't give us all of our food."}
{"text":"This place sucks they never get the order right they always mess up something  God forbid you get delivery they always forget your drinks ordered from here for years over the last couple of years it's gone downhill the employees don't care the quality of the food is horrible and they always mess things up never ordering from this one again I suggest no one else orders unless you want your order messed up or completely forgotten items off of what you ordered and don't get delivery their drivers always forget items giving it a zero Stars"}
{"text":"We are currently staying at the hotel across the street from this place and ordered from here last night because we didn't feel like going out. I was so surprised how good it was! The sandwich I got was amazing and my husband got the pizza. I'm not sure if there are any of these where we live but I am definitely going to find out."}
{"text":"Really good and decently priced pizza. Good selection on their pies. Not your average low quality product. The workers I've encountered so far are pretty cool. This is the place when you need something quick."}
{"text":"I drive just to come pick up this amazing pizza because neither location delivers to us. But sooooooo worth it! Why i didn't know about the garlic crust IDK! Next time for sure! Old world pepperoni  is fabulous! And the brownies ugh even more amazing! This pizza is in now way greasy! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Being from Northwest Ohio I have always loved Marcos pizza. I was very excited to see that when I moved to Lake County that there was one close to where I live.

Thankfully not only is the quality of Marco's good here in Mentor the workers are great as well. The manager of the store takes pride in what she does and runs a great store."}
{"text":"Food has always been very good and delivered promptly by courteous and friendly people."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this place out. Since I missed the free pizza last Sunday. So on to the review. 

Walking in you are greeted by their friendly staff and promptly placed our order. The restaurant is a lot bigger then it looks from the outside. But, the table we sat at was a bit dirty and could use a little more attention by the staff.

On to the food. We had a XL pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos, along with drinks. My only issue was that it was pretty greasy, but tasted delicious.  I usually judge my pizzas by the taste of the crust and this one didn't disappoint. 

So, I have to recommend this place. As it was better then some of the other restaurants places to eat around."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken with half jalapeño pizza. It was pretty damn good.  Sorry I forgot to take the picture before we ate half."}
{"text":"This past Saturday we ordered a take out 14 inch. The taste was decent. The toppings were a little skimpy. At this point I would have tried it again.  Then I realized I was chewing a hair"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Concord, or at least best pizza that is a chain and not a mom & pops location. You really can't go wrong. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went there with my mom on for lunch. Got fantastic service. The girl there who rung us up and brang us our pizza, Matti, was great. Told her we didnt have much time because i had to get back to work, and she made sure our pizza got put in right away."}
{"text":"The cheese bread is awesome! I eat here frequently and have never had a bad experience! Great specials Mon-Wed if you order online. Love me some Marcos pizza!!"}
{"text":"REALLY love it here. I work next door so I get to eat here on my breaks. The food is amazing and I LOVE the service. The staff is super nice and they make my pizza fast. So glad they are next door! Thanks Marcos!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delivered fast, hot and ready to eat! I've never had a problem with it being under cooked or not having enough of the toppings. 
One of my favorite places to order pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and excellent service. What more can you ask for? Oh yeah, great price!  They are always sending out coupons like buy one pizzeria get the second free.  Sounds like a win-win situation to me!"}
{"text":"Don't like at all... Too doughy and too expensive. Not very good pizza. It reminds me if Papa John's (gross)."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from Marcos tonight and it was superb. Way to go Marco's. Even the driver that called me was super polite and pleasant to speak with. The wings were on point . Both the Barbeque and Buffalo. Can't wait to reorder. Little Caesars and Pizza hut lost a client. #support #locals"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! Not only is the food not good but the place is ran by teenagers that are more concerned with what's on their phones than doing their job. Watched a guy sit on  food prep counter, think about all the disgusting things the butt of your pants comes in contact with or when you go to restroom and the butt of your pants is on the pissy floor or up against the toilet where piss has dripped down, then you sit where food is prepared. When I asked to speak to the manager, it turned out the guy that was sitting on the counter was the manager. His reply\" I don't use the restroom here\". The dinning room was a mess meanwhile all the kids working were just playing around. The list goes on and on. The whole staff should be fired and start fresh."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT pizza and exceptional service!!! Just moved into Rhodes Ranch and was unsure of our pizza delivery options.  Drove by Marcos earlier today and figured we would give it a shot!! We are not disappointed!!! Ordered a mushroom and pepperoni pizza for my husband and I, as well as a small extra olive pizza for my daughter and they were both delicious!!!! The woman who took our phone order was soo helpful and pleasant to speak with!! Pizza was delivered very quickly, nice and hot and exceeded our expectations!!!! Will definitely be ordering again soon!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad pie when i can not make it to my favorite. staff ia courteous and always accomodate any special orders."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the thin crust ... pizza is really good, you don't feel bad afterwards like you might with a place like Domino's ... clearly good ingredients ..."}
{"text":"I've got to say, that the place is pretty well put together. Nice and clean store and very friendly and attentive staff. The pizza prices were average I suppose, though there were some coupons available to get a better deal at the time. Driving home with the pizza, the car smelled great, I couldn't wait to get the pizza home and try it with the family.

We ordered:
1 x Large Uno (think Supreme pizza)
1 x Large Cheese Pizza (for the kids)
1 x Cheezy Bread order

Total came out to around $27 and change, so not bad.

Here are my critiques....because you can't really make a bad pizza, there are just some that are better than others.

1. The pizza diameters seemed a little small. Their Large measures out to what feels like a Medium at most other places. It was still 8 slices, but small slices. This sort of diminishes the perceived value of the pizza for the price when you realize how much smaller the pizza seems in real life.

2. Canned Mushrooms: These are the bane of existence in the pizza world. Why on Earth would any restaurant use canned mushrooms on a pizza? They don't cook right, nor do they even taste remotely like a fresh mushroom.

3. Green Peppers and Onions on the Uno pizza were way too under-cooked. They were practically raw...add onto that the let down of the canned mushrooms and it was a disastrous combination. Take a look at a Costco combo pizza, make note of how different their toppings come out of the oven versus this. I realize this is a franchise pizza joint, so maybe things have to be cooked and prepared this way to be consistent with the franchise model, but it was a big turn off for me and my family.


Here is what was GREAT about the dinner:

1. The pizza sauce was good, something slightly different tasting than the usual. Not over the top, but different in a pleasant way.

2. The cheese was good, and there was plenty of it.

3. The crust, I think that the crust was a redeeming quality to the pizza. Very crisp on the bottom, yet doughy and tasty on the top. That was probably prepared to perfection for what it was. Had the dough not been so good I think that this pizza experience would have been ruined.

4. The cheezy bread was GREAT. This was prepared so much softer than the pizza dough, and had that slightly undercooked quality to it that gave it almost an Auntie Anne's pretzel quality. Definitely a flavorful side dish. Also, came with a side of pizza sauce and a side of ranch to dip it in. Taste so good alone that it practically needed no dipping sauce, but the pizza sauce was so good, why not dip it.

I rated it 4 Stars, because there was things I liked about it, and things I did not and I realize that all boils down to personal preference. Someone might love the things I didn't and that could be why they would rave about the pizza so I guess to each their own."}
{"text":"Seating area is very small - take out or delivery is your best option. I have ordered pizza from this location twice and received great service on both visits. I really like the quality of the pizza - I ordered it with chicken. Chicken seems to be their only non-pork meat option. Beef pepperoni, chicken sausage, or some others would be a great addition to their toppings menu."}
{"text":"Quality toppings sausage is pretty good but the pizza itself is very doughy. And not much cheese. This would be a good $5 or maybe even $9.99 pizza but for $20 it's really not worth it. We had the so called cheese bread. It was mainly all just bread and extremely little cheese. I have had much better cheese bread at Little Caesars or dominoes."}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza here for several months and generally the service is prompt.  You order online and it gives you a timeframe for order to be ready.  Today it said 15 minutes.  It's now been almost 25 minutes since I ordered and PAID online but the workers tell me it'll take another 5 minutes (like they couldn't even find my order ticket). Opinion of this place went down real fast after this experience."}
{"text":"This place resembled Pizza Hut. Greasy, no flavor, toppings were scare and didn't taste fresh. Very disappointed. I highly do not recommend this place and will stick with my ultimate favorite...Blaze Pizza!!"}
{"text":"I order here all the time. Pizza is always hot & fresh. The staff is always friendly. Wish they delivered further out though."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza you can have delivered.  Everything is fresh with so many little details they let you make to crust thickness and crust toppings to different sauce and cut options. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Thee best pizza I've had....the kids and I tried this place a few months ago, and it's our new fave place and the prices aren't bad either. This is definitely our new place. Everything is cooked just right! We go at least 2-3 times a month that's how great it is."}
{"text":"Marco's Pizza is amazing. If it were more affordable, I'd order pizza at Marco's more often. This is exactly why you should only order when you have a coupon or order on a Monday, when you can get a large 1-topping pizza with delicious cheesy bread for $13.99 (online offer). Yup, I pretty much bide my time like an evil genius until a glorious coupon opportunity arises. 

The pizza here is irresistibly cheesy and the ingredients are fresh. You can pick a crust topper flavor for free. I usually go with garlic parmesan. The cheesy bread is the bomb diggity! Love it! The cheesy bread is the size of a small pizza, seriously. One (or maybe two) sauces are included with the bread. I'd recommend the marinara or garlic sauce.  

I usually order carry-out from here. Customer service is great. They have four locations in Las Vegas. Give 'em a try!

{"text":"So quick with delivery and food is always amazing. I prefer this place over every other pizza place that I've eaten at...and it's not any more expensive. The delivery drivers are always so nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I just called in to order a couple of 1 topping medium pizzas and the guy tells me those are $11.49. I said 11.49 are you serious. He says yes we're not little caeser's and we make quality pizza here. First of all your pizza isn't a bed of roses. It's good yes but it's not like it's the god of all pizza. Second of all you don't blast another company right to a customer over the phone like that. I felt that response was very unprofessional. I then call back to speak with the manager and the same guy answer's the phone. I ask to speak with the manager and he says \"he\" is on the phone right now. The same dude gets on the phone and says I'm the assistant manager for the evening. No you're not. You're the guy that just told me your manager was on the phone and he wouldn't put the manager on and he wouldn't give me his name. I ask one more time to speak with the manager and he say's \"she\" is not here. \"He\" to \"She\". that's odd. I told him I have never paid that much for a medium pizza and have been going there for 3 years and his response was oh we must have had a special for those and if you have been coming here for that long then you should know that. I just ordered 2 medium one topping pizzas and an order of boneless chicken like 2 weeks ago and the total was $27 including the tax and everything was regular price. This dude was a complete A**HOLE. Never have I ever had the employee's at this Marco's talk to me this way. 3 years of business and this is the customer service I get. I will never go to any Marco's again. I will take my business elsewhere. Totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"It's Friday night....where should we order out for pizza?

Location & Aesthetics -- located off Waddell, a little after the corner of Litchfield and Waddell, just behind Dunkin Donuts.
If you're heading west along Waddell, you might almost miss Marco's Pizza; however if you're heading east along Waddell, you will see it as that's where the signage is.  Overall, not difficult to find.
Lots of available parking in front of the business though parking is shared with Dunkin Donuts but still not a big deal.
Interior -- small but very clean and well lit.  
Noise level was okay even with staff working behind the counter.  

Service -- staff were friendly, polite, and helpful when I ordered over the phone.  I did have my mind set on ordering online however their online system did not recognize my coupon code.  
Staff still took the order and mentioned to bring in the coupon.  
When I did, I found out they already applied it so I was all squared away.  I particularly liked their online ordering system -- very user friendly and easy to understand interface with lots of options of crafting your pie especially how you like it, e.g. if you want toppings on the whole pizza or just on the left or right side, how you want it cooked -- well done, light, etc.  I don't think I've even seen that much detail before when ordering a pizza online but that's just me. 
I believe if you also sign up for their emails, you'll get a free order of cheesy bread!
I even found it interesting that the staff will open your boxes of pizza prior to leaving to ensure that everything is done right.  
Their philosophy on the pizza box stated that if your order isn't right, they are willing to fix it.

Menu -- nothing much to mention here really and it's just like any other pizza menu with lots of variety and options to choose from.    

Food -- ordered the two-topping, medium pizzas.  One was thin crust, with chicken and green peppers.  The other was regular crust, pepperoni and green peppers.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Bottom of the crust wasn't burnt and the dough tasted oven fresh.  They were piping hot, fresh, not heavy on the seasonings, crispy (thin crust), cheesy, (for me) not very greasy or oily, very filing but not with the stuffed or overstuffed feeling!  Price was superb even if this order was on special with a coupon.

I think Marco's Pizza will be my go-to for pizza for the time being!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, noticed this baked in our pizza. It's not the pepperoni pineapple or mushrooms. It's a hair ball baked in our pizza."}
{"text":"Marco's serves up a pretty good pizza.

I took my wife and daughter here for some dine-in pizza one lazy day.  We've ordered delivery from here, but since we were in the area, I figured we should dine-in.

We ordered half pepperoni, half onions and mushrooms.  The pizza was delish.  I think Marco's is on par with Papa Johns and Donatos.  Marco's tastes better than Pizza Pan, Pizza Hut and Antonio's, imo.

I just found out one of my co-workers delivers for Marco's part-time, so I'll be ordering from here again soon.

http://marcos.com/"}
{"text":"We ordered Marco's for dinner. See my picture for how it arrived. The driver apparently had to slam on his brakes pretty hard to cause this, yet lacked the awareness to check his pizzas for damage.

We ate the pizza anyway and it was good, nonetheless. I called Marco's and was promised a credit for the pizza, which we can use on our next order. I'm not sure there will be a next order."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizzas from this place for several years, rebought our house in 2007 and I'm certain I found Marcos not that long after,or it feels that way at least.  I have always loved this place and rated it at 41/2 stars in my mind. However lately it's slipped a little, one lady on the phone was rude and I was put off by her approach. The pizzas seem to be more expensive now then when I used to order.  I wanted a Xl thin crust but was told they don't offer one so I asked what they would suggest and was told to order two large thin crust to equate to ordering a xl thin.  Made sense to me but the price was crazy.  I thought well Lesson learned never do that again.   My past few orders have had mistakes or missing the extra sauce or parmesan cheese. 
It just doesn't have that same service and value anymore.  I will say that all their drivers are super polite.   Always just very outgoing."}
{"text":"Each time we call later in the evening, or show up at the store, the staff acts inconvenienced at our inquiry. I have also had the same pizza \"special\" made incorrectly with my last two orders. Tonight, I was put off by the threat on the phone that the driver was \"on a delivery\" and that my order would be \"super late\" if I still wanted delivery. Apparently,nothing can be ordered after 10:30 p.m. for delivery. I find it awkward that I've had the feeling we were keeping staff awake with each late night visit or inquiry. Owners, please evaluate your staff, because it will be your demise in the Summerlin market. Your food is decent for pizza take-out, make sure your staff is decent as well."}
{"text":"Most average pizza ever. Half didn't have cheese and wings were completely soggy and tasteless."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and had a Med original crust with jalapeño/ pepperoni. The sauce and cheese is very delicious which made the entire pizza come out very tasty. The prices are very reasonable and a good deal for the very good taste. Will be ordering again very soon."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza at chain restaurant price. It is the closest thing to east coast pizza for Vegas's nearly zero humidity.  My family's top choices are sausage, eggplant and white cheese. The ham sandwich is actually really good too. It is also great that they always have coupon offers."}
{"text":"Always pick them over Pizza Hit or Dominos they are the freshest and quickest.. I got a pizza and wings and the driver put the wings on top of the pizza and all the cheese got stuck on the top of the box. I called and let them know the offered to send a new one out or give a credit.. Customer service and food is great"}
{"text":"Phone etiquette was not there. Pizza was over an hour late. I understand if you're going to be late, a phone call would be great to let us know. 

Pizza was not the greatest but not the worst, tasted like cafeteria pizza. Ordered some cinnamon squares and the frosting came wrapped rolled in a piece of wax paper. Doesn't seem that sanitary. It's hard to open with the tape around it.

Pizza was cold
We are displeased with this pizza place."}
{"text":"Was disgusted to see young guy make salad and pizza without gloves as he touches the phone and everything around than goes back to making food without washing hands.  Gross....
Pizza bland - nothing to write home about.
Wear gloves or wash your hands before touching people's food"}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Median price. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Ok, wife just went there to get us a pizza.  Dude handled cash and then pizza with the same bare hands.   Shame on him.   Marco's just got added to my wife's NEVER GO THERE list.   She never forgets either!   Guess we'll become fans of some other place."}
{"text":"Awwww it was a nice quick tasty but greasy pizza. They have a good square box deal if you need to feed a lot of people aka kids lol. The old world pep is crispy and greasy as well. I did enjoy a sub as well. Not the best pizza but not the worst either fir the price."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out and the service is \"okay.\" The food was also \"okay.\"
I probably won't have it again.


I thought the pizza was very very greasy. I don't know why so much of the crust toppers was on the side of the pizza box. Crust toppers- more like box confetti. The food just seems like it's made so sloppy."}
{"text":"This is a new place around me.  Ordered a thin crust supreme and a steak & cheese sub.  Delivery was quick.  Price was competitive.  Sub was underwhelming but acceptable.  My breakdown of the pizza as follows:. Crust was good, sausage was good, peppers uncooked, onions raw, mushrooms were from a can.  The pizza lacked any kind of seasoning or herbs.  All said, a pretty average product in a pretty crowded and competitive food niche.  I see no reason for a return visit.  I would give 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ok. So this place has been open about a month. Seems clean. But who ever owns this store should step in and better train their employees. It took 3 try's to pour a beer. And since beer is a big mark up this beer down the drain. And what is it with a new place that has tables that wobble. I had to do the old napkin routine to balance it. I'm waiting for my pizza. Ok. It's here. Lol. Looks nice. Here's hoping for good things. So we ordered a hand tossed pie. 1/2 plain 1/2 mushroom. Thank god it was good. I won't order a beer again but I can see myself coming back for pizza. Good luck guys. OWNER get into this store and help train these kids."}
{"text":"I had Marco's delivered to a hotel and specifically requested plates, parmesan, and red pepper flakes.   The young man I spoke to kinda of brushed my request off as if it was a given that I would receive these items. Pizza was delivered WITHOUT plates, cheese or pepper. My family loves Marco pizza, but when you drop the ball like this, it makes me want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but their ability to get an order correct is very hard for them.  Manager leaves in the middle of the dinner rush.  I ordered thin crust and got regular.  For them to fix it, I will go to the end of the queue and have to wait an 1 hour and a half (after waiting 45 for the wrong pizza).  This is the wrong pizza or items delivered 3 out of the last 4 times."}
{"text":"This probably my favorite fast food pizza. It's tasty, quick, and they are able to deliver! Every time I feel like ordering pizza, this is where I get it from. I always go with a small pizza and some garlic butter sauce on the side. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a yummy quick pizza meal for the family!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. I've only ever ordered for delivery and it always arrives hot. Other items like cheesy  bread and sandwiches are also good. I wish the wings were better, I like them deep fried crispy, no giggly, wiggly skin."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place by far. They welcome every customer with a warm smile and take their time with you to make sure your happy with what you odered and make sure you leave satisfied with what you purchased. I've been a regular for a few months now and will definitely continue."}
{"text":"I've been eating Marco's for the last couple of years after looking for an alternative to Papa Johns, and it is WAY more flavorful. The seasoned crust is a nice little treat at the end of each slice. The employees at this location are super nice too!"}
{"text":"*NO STARS* so glad I started eating pizza first....there was pieces of black plastic in our pizza!!!! My 5 yr old was about to partake when I found 3 hard black pieces of plastic that I bit into! I can't believe that my kids could have bit into this or swallow it. We ordered a few items but were so disgusted that we just returned everything!  My husband left to return the items because I don't want to be accused of consuming the items and not returning it all...we wouldn't want to eat anything else anyway. Such a disappointment and ruining of dinner and appetites! We will def NOT be ordering from here again...once is enough! Terrible!"}
{"text":"We ordered Marco's again... The pizza is good but the canned mushrooms just kill it, please change to fresh. We also ordered their buffalo style wings and really recommend them! Big, meaty and great flavor so if you're a fan of wings make sure to hit these up!"}
{"text":"Sooo happy a Marcos FINALLY opened near us! The employees are extremely pleasant and accommodating and seem to genuinely care about customers satisfaction which is rare to find anymore. Food is delicious as always! Welcome to the neighborhood guys:)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza! I was skeptical when a co worker told me to try it. I tried it and it's my new go to! I personally love the hand tossed pizza but I have tried the thin crust just to switch it up. So how did they compare? They were both awesome! Thin crust lovers and hand tossed will love it. I'm sure everyone else would too but I'm speaking from experience on those crust. I love the pepperoni pizza. It always taste so good and a small is perfect for two meals for single me. I highly recommend this pizzaaaaaaa !!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Marcos to order a few pies for lunch and to my surprise I had a credit on the account! 
A surprise credit is always a great thing! 

I got two medium one topping pies, cheesy bread and a half gallon of sweet tea and my tab was $10.69! 
Not only was I satisfied with the price, but the pies were hot, fresh and oozing with mozzarella cheese!

Even though this Marcos always seems to be busy and short staffed the workers do try their best to please the customers!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza!! They left a flyer in our mailbox a few months ago & I have to admit...I was like \"who the heck is Marco?!\"  Well, as luck would have it, The Hubs & I decided to have an impromptu date night and ordered one of the deals.  The delivery was prompt and piping hot! Then, we tasted the pizza...

OMFG where has Marco's been all our lives?! Why were we not eating this pizza perfection sooner?! The pizza was so good! Plus, I love green olives, so to be able to have it on a pizza already had me at \"hello\"! I have to say, we have not strayed since. I don't care that they don't have points or whatnot, the pizza is so good! I can't see myself eating anything else; honestly, it now pales in comparison!

Thank you, Marco's Pizza for moving in the neighborhood and for completely winning our hearts! I look forward to my next pizza (probably next week...)!!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was fine.  They could have put a little more pepperoni on it but over all it was good and lasted a long time in the fridge.  The cheesy bread was also pretty good.  i mixed the marinara and the other sauce to make it it even tastier.  We would try it again."}
{"text":"We had Marcos pizza twice and it was good, but their website for ordering is so bad...very slow, clunky and can't save an order to use again in future.  Well, their website wouldn't let us do a build your own pizza.  As we were in the neighborhood, we drove to Marco's to place the order and showed the manager that both my phone and my husbands their website wouldn't allow a build your own.  He indicated that problems on their website while using a smartphone  is not uncommon. As they offer online-only coupons, I assumed they would offer a similar discount to us, but they would not.  No discounts unless ordered online even though we couldn't order online.  LOUSY customer service.  Next-door to Marco's is a grocery store, so we went in there and bought our dinner instead.  Will not go there again...too many other better choices nearby that would be happy to give us a few bucks off of two large pizzas when their website was screwed up!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good as usual based on flavor. The reason for this review is that, Iike in the commercials, my pizza must've been used as a Frisbee among the employees. When I opened the box, pieces were scrambled about and sticking to each other. After trying to reassemble the pizza to a round shape, I lost a few pieces due to the toppings sticking to the bottom of others. I'll order again but this one was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The delivery times are good. The drivers are friendly. The management, specifically a girl whose name starts with \"T\", is an embarrassment to Marco's. After the driver showed up with my bill and I noticed my on-line coupon wasn't applied, he said to call the store and they would take care of it. \"T\" said that \"you should of noticed the coupon didn't apply when you checked out\". I said \"I thought it would apply at the store and didn't notice until the driver arrived and he said to call so, I'm calling\". She said \"well there's nothing I can do about it now\" and I said \"really? That's it\"? She replied \"yep. Have a good night\" and HUNG UP ON ME. I called back abut 10 minutes later to get her name so I could fill out the \"tell us about your experience\" on-line survey and her natural, horrible, customer service skills came pouring out when I asked for her name. She began yelling at me that she wasn't rude to me the previous time and that she didn't hang up on me. Again, while she was yelling at me. Then she proceeded to say \"see if you ever get anything out of this store again\". Exactly. See if I do. 

This happened 5-24-15 and I told Marco's I wanted to be contacted by a customer service rep. As of 6-8-15 I haven't been. All because she wouldn't void a sale and ring it back up for a few bucks less and was downright rude and nasty about it. Like most customer service complaints, it isn't necessarily about the money. It's about how poorly it was handled."}
{"text":"This is when I wished they had half stars because I would give 3.5 stars. We dined in and ordered the chicken dippers and meat lovers pizza. 
Chicken dippers were tasty. But not temp hot. I'm kind of a ranch snob. I wish they had better ranch. But the Sweet chili spicy sauce was tasty. 
Pizza was really good! Didn't take long to come out. I enjoyed the crispy bottom and doughy crust. But what I don't understand is how a pizza can come out of a 470 degree oven and toppings be cold. Under the toppings the sauce and crust were hot. But the toppings were cool. 
Service was just ok. Could be better. There were a lot of employees. 
So overall. Pizza was great. Just wish everything was hot."}
{"text":"Food: Their pizza is very good.  One of the better chains by far.  They experiment with a lot of different toppings and crust, and allow so many customizations that you can really get unique pizza from this place.  The Chicken, Spinach and Feta is an indulgent pleasure.  Sometimes they are really sparse with the toppings, and their dessert and drink selections are limited.

Service: You never know.  Sometimes the people are accommodating and friendly other times they are not.  They charge a delivery fee of two bucks in addition to the tip, but delivery service is prompt and courteous.  
Delivery beats pick up ANYDAY of the week.  Every time I've called in my order for pick up it was never ready at the specified time, then you have to deal with the counter people, and they're not very pleasant.  

Price: They offer promotions, via internet, smart phones or direct mail coupons.  You really can get a lot for your money.   

Atmosphere: Cold, clean, and cramped eating space.  They cater to a take-out customer base.  You always see one or two people in there looking up at the game on the sad television mounted in the corner, waiting for their order as delivery people rush in and out of the front door for their runs.  They have a small, well lit parking lot.  This place is a pizza factory.  No personality."}
{"text":"We had won a pizza party at work, and we decided to get some pizza from Marco's.  I had never had their pizza before, but some of my coworkers had, and they said it was pretty solid.  I was excited to try it out!

We got 3 pizzas total....2 pepperoni and a white pizza with chicken, feta, tomatoes and onions.  I had 3 slices of pepperoni and 2 of the white.  Here is how they were.........

Pepperoni-  First of all, they use 2 different kinds of pepperoni!  Score!  They use a regular sliced pepperoni and then they also use a smaller, Hormel type pepperoni.  This makes for some nice texture differences as well as different flavors.  The smaller Hormel type pepperonis get nice and crispy, while the slices are solid and meaty.  They use a good quality cheese, good sauce, and a medium thick crust.  The crust was brushed with some kind of garlic butter or something. The crust also had a great yeasty flavor to it.  The flavor of the crust reminded me of our families old go to pizza back in Hawthorne in the 80s (Hanks Pizza).  It was mighty tasty.  The pizza was sort of a crossbreed between a Barros and a Mountain Mikes (California) pizza. If you have had pizzas from those places before, you will know what I mean once you try a Marco's pizza.

White Pizza-  This was my favorite!  It was incredibly tasty!  It had pieces of chicken on it, some feta cheese, some sliced tomatoes, a shitload of onions (I love onions!) and a white/garlic sauce.  It was delicious!  I can see myself craving this specific pizza in the future.  The pepperoni pizza was good, but this one was better!

They are actually building one of these in Surprise near my house.  I can totally see this becoming our \"go to\" pizza place in Surprise.  It was a good first impression and I can't wait to try it again.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"So, this Marco's just opened near my house (maybe a month or two ago) and we have been here about 3 times since.  This Marco's is really small (2 tables inside, 4 seats total) and should be used either for takeout, or delivery.  It would be really weird and awkward if you dined in here (even though it is possible).  We have gotten 3 pepperoni pizzas and here are my observations and recommendations...............

1.  Get your pizza \"well done\".  Marco's is a tad greasy (not in a bad way), and when cooked \"regular\", it seems even more greasy than it actually is.  When you get it cooked \"well done\" it browns the cheese a bit, and seems \"less greasy\".  
2.  Order online and click on \"Hot Deals\" on the left hand side of the screen.  That will show you all of their specials, and automatically apply the coupon during checkout.
3.  I mentioned we got pepperoni pizzas all 3 times.  The first time, we got an extra large pepperoni pizza.  It was just alright.  The last 2 times, we went with large \"Pepperoni Magnifico\" pizzas.  Go with the Magnifico.  It comes with 2 types of pepperonis (regular and small ones that curl up nice and crispy), and a garlic butter/parmesan crust.  It tastes way better than the plain pepperoni pizza, and those little pepperonis are absolutely delicious!  This will be our go to order going forward.  Lot's of cheese, good tasting sauce and a medium/thick crust.  Pretty tasty pizza!
4.  Service is fine.  Bunch of young kids working at the shop, but they are friendly enough.

Our go to pizza used to be Barro's.  Marco's has since replaced them.  Same price (possibly cheaper with coupons), similar style and texture, but Marco's tastes better and I haven't gotten sick from them (happened a few times at Barro's).  It's definitely not in my \"top 10 pizzas\" or anything like that, but for a local chain, with good prices and good tasting pizza, it is fine by me!  We will continue to come back as long as they are around."}
{"text":"This is my new found pizza spot (Marco's). I am a big advocate of cheese. I hate when I buy a pizza and they skimp out on the cheese. I like it to be like the tv commercial all gooey! I must say this pizza has pretty good cheese. The Manager Ke-Ke is awesome. It was my first time using this location and she really took good care of me. Judging by the conversations I heard in the background they must hire a lot of young people. The guy on the phone didn't seem to be able to answer my questions effectively so I asked for a manager. Ke-Ke was amazing, very friendly, nice and provided excellent customer service! Delivery was not long and the driver was pretty friendly as well. I am a sucker for good cheese and customer service and this time I got both."}
{"text":"Solid pizza. They had a 6.99 medium 1 topping pizza deal so tried this place out. Comes with 8 slices. When you think of your average pizza, I think this would match that. I kind of wish they had more pizza sauce on the slices, and I chose meatball as my topping - not going to lie it wasn't seasoned very well. I think you can flavor your crusts and choose a side sauce for free? Nice bonus, I picked garlic butter and pizza sauce. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the garlic butter on my crust.

The restaurant itself is clean and spacious, and the employee that helped me out was pretty nice. I ordered ahead of time and I was about 10 mins late to when the pizza was scheduled to be ready. Add 7 min drive home, and the pizza was already warm by then. I'll give Marco's the benefit of the doubt on that."}
{"text":"I have been here 9 times the service is always friendly. The pizza are always fresh made to order with no hassles. Will continue to return"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and salad. Way better than Little Caesars and Papa Johns... I am not even going there with Domino's and Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just nostalgia since I had Marco's growing up, but the pizza is always good.

The service? Hmm well, now, uh, so, yea, eh, I get it that you don't get the top percentile of people wanting to throw pizza around.  I'm pretty sure I got delivery once and got my credit card information stolen.  Hey, probably happens all the time.  So I only do pickup.  It's close, and they are always on time.  One time they did mess up my late night order, and I had to wait but they offered me the error for free, so that's worth it.

Pepperoni, banana pepper, and jalapeño is the way to go.  Standard crust.  Get the dippers for the crust. Ok so it's not Angelo's or Map Room, but those have 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Tried their small, thin, deluxe pizza. Very impressed! This time I ordered for take out and once I've arrived, the pizza was ready. No detours! Had to get home and try it while it's fresh!! I highly recommend for others to try them out. There's no way you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sorry no pics but we ordered xl pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers and mushrooms. Also 15 wings, regular antipasto salad and small cheese pizza. Total was $49 (that's with $5 off for ordering online). Kind of pricey but I figured we needed to try the new pizza joint by us. The pizza was delicious, mushrooms were missing but the sausage was amazing. Salad was eh okay, mostly lettuce which is fine for a pizza place. The wings were just like peter piper pizza, frozen and fatty. If you are going for just pizza this is the place to go. The subs they have looked very tasty we just didn't order any this time. I will never order wings or salad from this place again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place! So far the best pizza I had in Harrisburg and Charlotte. My favorite pizzas are the pepperoni magnifico, and chicken Florentine. Their subs are also pretty good."}
{"text":"We ordered a the New Yorker style pizza from Marcos.  As soon as we received it, I knew immediately it wasn't New York style.  I took a picture of it and called the store.  The guy who was the supposed manager was terrible on the phone.  He told me he was sure he it was the New Yorker because he made the pizza.  He made me feel as though I was just trying to get something free.  I told him that I wanted to speak to his manager and he wouldn't put anyone else on the phone.  He gave me the email of the district manager.  I sent the picture of the pizza to him and never heard back.  Marcos has always been our go to pizza. Our son loves the cheezybread.  We are just really upset about the customer service from our past experience.  My brother also ordered the New Yorker and sent me a picture of his.  It is obvious they sent us the wrong pizza.  I wish I could post photos of both in the review.  Pretty good pizza but terrible customer service. I will post a picture of the new york pizza sent to us in the photos."}
{"text":"I like Marco's Pizza, and have happily ordered from here until today. On this visit I decided to pick my pizza up on my way home and save a few bucks. Apparently, the staff had other ideas. My pizza was 13 and change. When I got home, my credit card had been changed an extra 3.00. I called the store and asked for an explanation for the discrepancy. There wasn't one. The manager called his boss, called me back and said his boss told him -- wait for it-- it must be a problem with my bank. 

Seriously?

I told him, very nicely and calmly, that it wasn't my bank. He has a thief in his store. He said there couldn't be, there was no way they had over charged me. There was my slip, after all! I was going to explain how cheaters cheat, but I was already too annoyed. I'll be calling the main office in the morning. Bottom line? Pay cash or go somewhere else. Don't let some highschool kid cheat you."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the third bad experience I've had with them so it's time to leave a review. Everyone has a bad day so I always give a place at least a second chance and today I'm regretting it. I ordered 2 pizzas online and one of them was incorrect. While I understand it happens (3 times), it's upsetting when it cost me my time and my gas to get what I ordered. If the attitude from the employees & mgr had been professional and courteous, I wouldn't have been so upset but instead their attitude was smug and disrespectful.  I know people say this but literally my time is money for me and my family so the extra 45 minutes this took was unacceptable. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Never ever will I go back to buy pizza & wings again.  This past Saturday I bought pizza & wings for my family.  I ordered plain wings & they gave me hot wings.  I called & told them my order was wrong so my husband went back to get the plain wings. Well my kids & I ate it and we got sick having diarrhea.  Never ever call them back that your order is wrong they will put something in your food.   Hell no will I ever ever go back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza in a pretty good location.

A coworker and myself were starving after working late and were in the area. All we saw was a pizza sign and so we chose to eat here. The workers were nice. I could definitely see that they were busy because we had to wait a while to order. Delivery drivers were in and out and it seems like \"all hands were on deck\" and not just people standing around. 

My coworker and I both got small cheese pizzas (10 inches) with a soda. It was approximately $10 which wasn't a bad price for cheese but I can see how it can get pricey if you like a lot of toppings. It's over $1 per topping- ouch! 

The pizza was pretty good and still tasted good for breakfast the following day when I heated it in the oven. The only thing I dislike is that they don't sell by the slice but that won't stop me from returning."}
{"text":"Been using Marcos for at least a year . The pizza is great and the delivery drivers are always wicked fast . I live nearby but sometimes I'm just amazed I order and they are at my house with the pizza in 15 20 minutes everybody's always trying to be helpful there. The food is always great I don't like the thin crust I would stick with the traditional or thick crust"}
{"text":"I love Marcos! Order it at least once a week. Pam (the owner) knows me when I call. Very friendly staff and awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Long wait, nothing great for food, soggy wings, doughy cheese bread.  Sauces are warm and disgusting.  Crust of pizza was good but that's it.  I won't be back...too many other options in area."}
{"text":"This place is so good! And that's saying somthing being from the east coast :) they are always on time and it's hot"}
{"text":"I order pizza from Marco's very often and it's usually wonderful. However, today I ordered a pizza at 5:30 PM. They had some issues while I was on the phone but quoted me 80 minutes. Okay, 80 minutes is pretty long for Marcos. They usually have the pizza delivered within 30 minutes. But I really wanted some pizza. I've been eating really healthy and haven't had pizza in a few weeks so I was really looking forward to this. Anyway, fast forward 80 minutes.. still no pizza. At 85 minutes I decided to call. The first person that answered acted like he had no idea I even placed an order. He handed over the phone to Jose, who told me he was a manager. Jose told me that they were swamped and that he couldn't even tell me a time that I would receive the pizza I had ordered 85 minutes prior. He said he could maybe quote me an additional 30 minutes but that he just really had no idea how long it would take. Needless to say, I told him I didn't want the pizza at an indefinite time. He asked if I would like to cancel the order. No real concern at all. Great customer service. I will not be eating at Marco's anymore."}
{"text":"The pizza was over priced for what you get. The service was shit
 ordered online said it would be ready in 15 min. Got there only to wait 30 more min because they forgot about me wtf. Dont want anything for free just so tired of getting shitty service mediocre food. Manager called but that was because of corporate and only was a check list she had to do only called once just wanted to see if it really matter but quess not."}
{"text":"Tried Marcos pizza tonite after receiving some coupons in the mail and have to say it's pretty damn good! The pepperoni was cooked perfectly on the pizza and crust was yummy! We were a little disappointed in the cheesy bread as it wasn't very cheesy but won't stop us from ordering again! Overall delicious and Marcos pizza is probably our pizza place from now on! Also delivery was on point!! Good work everyone"}
{"text":"We had pizzas delivered...great pizza ..hot fresh..my  kids loved it . Delivery staff so nice and helpful..overall good pizza. good price. good delivery ..hot fresh pizza"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I've never before experienced such lack of care in a business as I have with Marco's. 

The first pizza we ordered took over an hour to arrive and then when it did the driver brought the wrong order so he had to go back and get ours. In return for such a horrible experience they gifted us with free breadsticks with our next order. 

Fast forward to tonight...I have a sick toddler and needed dinner for my husband and I was in a bind with dinner for him & I so I told him to order Marcos and use the free bread stick coupon we had. 

He couldn't use the code online for the breadsticks...whatever no big deal. We still ordered the pizza. 

Our pizza was taking forever to come again and he called and a woman he spoke with over the phone said the driver would be there any minute now. 20 minutes pass and he calls again and speaks with someone else and that person said we had no order in the system but my husband had an order confirmation number from his online order. The person he spoke with didn't try to rectify the mess and only asked if we wanted to order the pizza. No apology for anything. Uhh the part that get my blood boiling is the woman he spoke with previously lied about the status of our order just to save face. 

Seriously, order from here if you want to be throughly disappointed and still have to go find pizza from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fast service. I usually do a carryout and my orders have always been on time. Very welcoming members who work there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. They deliver an actual HOT pizza quickly. Tons of toppings, no skimping on ingredients and it is delicious. They are pricy for a pizza delivery place but it's worth it for what you get!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and they deliver to Mountains Edge. I also ordered the Greek salad and it was very good!"}
{"text":"not the best pizza, but it was pretty good. place was clean and employees were ALL very friendly. i will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail for a free medium signature pizza. This is a crafty marketing strategy. I got hooked. The free deal required me to buy something at regular price so I got the garlic cheese bread. This was a good choice. I walked in and waited about 10 minutes for my order.

The pizza has a hand tossed crust. The prep area is in full view of the front counter, so I watched the talented pizza chef toss my crust and top it. The pizza was hot and cooked to perfection. The toppings were abundant and evenly distributed. There is a generous amount of sauce. I like a saucy pizza. The sauce has a sweetness which works well with the seasonings. There is not too much cheese but just enough to get the melted strings when you bite into it. This pizza scores a 4 out of 5 for crust texture and sauce, cheese, and topping ratio.

The cheese bread was good, but chewy. It had a nice flavor and came with marinara and ranch dipping sauces. It was a good deal along with the medium pizza. for $5.00. I also got a customer appreciation card to be punched every time I buy a pizza. The 10th one is free. So with this kind of deal and good quality, I will be making several return trips to Marco's."}
{"text":"Placed an order on-line the day before for a staff function. I even called to make sure the order was received. The following day I went to pick up the pizzas expecting them to be ready. When I arrived they had trouble finding the order, blaming it on a faulty computer system that was \"going to be replaced\". I had to wait (currently waiting 10 minutes so far) for the pizzas to be made. Guess next time I call the day of as well to make sure they are doing their job."}
{"text":"Came around hoping for a cheesy, delicious slice of pizza, but they don't sell by the slice. I tried the pizza sub instead and it really delivered. Satiated my craving with no complaint. Was here in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday and was the only customer. Daniel took my order and gave me great service!"}
{"text":"Great pizza chain. Wife and I ate at the one in the southwest. Glad to see a store on the Northwest now. Great cheesy bread also!"}
{"text":"Awesome sauce and the cheese stretches a foot long. It's a really tasty pizza!  This beats all of the other chains by far. Even my picky kids ate it reheated and that never happens. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! Better than your average chain pizzas. We order from here on a semi-weekly basis the pizza is always hot and made to perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, tried others in the area, cannot compare.  Went back 3 times since they just opened.  Friendly staff,  I ordered via phone and pizza was ready when they said it would be.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week! A fantastic pizza delivery option being that they have great subs and salads etc if you're not in the mood for pizza.. I've had several 'screw ups' on my orders but the manager always makes it right..even with those incidences I still give it 5stars :) yum!"}
{"text":"I'm certainly a fan!  I'm a pizza lover all the way and these guys do it right!  I had no idea they were a chain with over 500 locations either!  I first learned of Marco's via a flyer left on my front door.  Shortly after that I saw their delivery drivers in and out of my neighborhood.  I thought to myself, their food must be good if everyone keeps ordering from there so perhaps I should give it a try.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed!  Perfect crust, perfect toppings, perfect cheese, perfect sauce....pretty much perfect pizza!  Always excellent service as well.

If you are within range, delivery is definitely a better option.  Their inside dining room is very small and is not intended as a sit down hangout.  Get it to go or just have them bring it to you.  Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program!

They offer various crust flavor options, the usual array of toppings and even some not so usual cheese options.  Want cheddar on your pizza?  They've got you covered.

Give them a try.  You can't really go wrong with pizza after all!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and tastes like thick crust, frozen pizza. We only went because we had a coupon, that they didn't let us use when we got there."}
{"text":"It's not \"authentic\" as I have been to Napoli many times but it is good. It's better than your Papa Johns and your Pizza Hut but it's not authentic. I still prefer Rocco's New York Style but I live in the area and it's close. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"He's checking the list and checking it twice.. no joke the team AlWays - double checks your order and food quality -Marcos is about the fine detail even down to your two sauce cups. No disappointments. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"We've been needing a good pizza carry-out/delivery in Harrisburg for years. I called in an order to Marco's for the first time on the day they opened and was pleasantly surprised.

The ingredients were fresh, the sauce tasty, good quality cheese and meats, and the crust was excellent. Even though this was their first day open and they were busy, my order arrived within the 15 minutes they quoted when I called.

If they can maintain this level of consistency they'll beat the crap out of Papa J's, Pizza Nuts, and others!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Marco's pizza is one of my favorites. A few summers ago I practically had Marco's 3 nights a week for dinner (unhealthy I know). 

I was anxiously awaiting for this location to open up when I saw the signage out front. A few days after opening, I placed an order for delivery. It was a mess. 

THEY DON'T OFFER THE BIG SQUARE DEAL!!! The $11.99 special that practically put Marco's on the map. Medium square pizza, full order of cheesy bread. And a 2-liter. The manager was courteous and extended the offer to me this time, but told me it wasn't something they normally offer. 

They also had my order messed up. I ordered 3 toppings, they only put 2 of them on the pizza. It wasn't a terribly complicated order either. With it being less than 7 days after opening I was a little disappointed. Typically Q.C. is top notch when a franchise opens up because they want to impress customers. 

I'm really bummed by this location. Looks like I'll have to get my Marco's elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Pizza is OK and delivery is quick, but do NOT order the sub or wings!!  The wings (first and only time I ordered them) were the tiniest wings I had ever seen in my life!  I was so blown away by the size I even measured them...less than 2 inches in length for the LONGEST one in the bunch!  The last time I ordered, I ordered the Italian sub and it was so thin, I could not even tell it had meat on it!!  Lettuce, what there was of it was \"rusty\" looking and soggy, overall just HORRIBLE!  I did the survey on their site, stated the same thing.... not even an email or phone call!!  Absolutely the worst pizza place in town."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good for the first time trying it. Got regular pepperoni and cheese and it was good. Will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza resembles Pizza Hut but It was good. Tastes fresh and has really good flavor. Wings were good but not amazing. Customer service was great, I would order again."}
{"text":"We usually order carry out.
Sometimes out of wing sauces.
This location should consider online ordering.
And do away with making carbon copies debit cards at the door for delivery, placing a piece of paper over your card and rubbing a pencil across"}
{"text":"Decent pizza! Better than any other chain I have tried."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  A little pricier than your Domino's/Little Caesar's fare, but a better taste and occasionally good deals.  Pepperoni Magnifico is a great choice.  The other sides are ok.  But the pizza is great."}
{"text":"Pizza didn't have enough sauce, wings were soggy, was okay. But don't know if I would be back."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite pizza place. We decided to give it a try a few months ago and have never looked back. It's really good pizza. I would say one of the best in town. They can also pair your pizza with a movie which is a fun feature for weekends. 

My only reason for the less than perfect review is that they are a little careless about the orders. I would say more times than not, they give us the wrong order. Either different toppings entirely, or give us two of the same pizza when we asked for two separate style pizzas. Just something they need to improve on."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from Marco's a few times now,  and their pizza as well as customer service is fantastic.  The food is always consistent and the quality is spot on, especially for a chain establishment.  I didn't know until today's order,  You could have the crust seasoned.  We opted for both parmesan & garlic crust topping (offered at NO CHARGE! ) The delivery times are always before quoted. For instance,  today estimated time was 35 minutes.  24 minutes after ordering,  our doorbell rang,  and our professional pizza driver brings our complete order (I always order extra sauces, and Hut & game pieces never bring them,  excuses,  and I've already paid on card..., let's get back to Marco's) The pizzas had ample toppings,  no big bubbles, perfect crust and was piping hot!  Our family chef salad had tons of high quality meats & cheeses and crisp well seasoned house made croutons. We usually order the family deal,  instead of wings (our usual choice) we went with the chicken dippers. Those were small,  my kiddos liked them,  but for 10 quarter to half dollar size chicken nuggets,  I would suggest sticking to the wings. We are very happy with Marco's pizza and we'll continue to order from them. The pizza tastes fresh and are made with good ingredients and the dough is fresh and made in house.  Definitely look up a coupon,  there are plenty to be had. The people working the phones are polite and knowledgeable and are patient when you blank out or change your order.  Marco's,  keep up the quality & the great pizza!

Today's order was done through the online ordering system and again,  showed up perfect,  as ordered.  Since we had a coupon and knew exactly what we wanted, we tried out the online ordering system and again 5!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Marco's pizza. The service at this new location still needs work. First time, they messed up on our moving day and we had a bunch of hungry people that had to wait an extra hour. Somehow they wanted to charge us $90 for 5 pizzas. We worked the price out and got the correct pizzas and they were good. Next time, I was alone for dinner and decided to order delivery. Bacon and Green olives are what I get when I'm alone, so that's what I ordered online. Web said it would be 45 minutes but I was pleasantly surprised when it was here in about 25! Delivery girl was super nice and I left a decent tip. Got the pizza inside and found black olives!! Oh no! I musta screwed up! I checked my email:green olives. Musta been a web to store error, receipt attached to pizza box :green olives. So I call, girl on phone puts me on hold to talk to the manager, comes back and says I ordered black olives....nnoooooo I checked email and receipt. Ok bring it back and we will remake it.....noo, it was delivered. Oh ok, we will have it remade and bring it back out. Perfect! Thank you! In my head \"Please don't drag my pizza around on the floor\" The pleasant young lady brought it back out, I feel bad because I didn't have any cash to tip her again (she essentially did the delivery for free, and I'm guessing she didn't make the mistake).  I will get pizza there again because I really like it and the delivery girl was nice, but I really hope there are no more screw ups."}
{"text":"Let me say first, that the delivery was prompt, and the person taking my order was courteous, friendly, and polite. But the problem with this Marcos Pizza is that it's the worst pizza I have ever had. I'm not exaggerating. Nothing about this pizza tasted real. I had two pieces because I was so hungry, but by the third, I felt like I would not be able to keep it down. I immediately drank Vernor's ginger ale to settle my stomach. This is one of those occasions where the employees are great, but the product is horrible."}
{"text":"This is a new pizza spot just opening up! Today 1/7/17 is opening day and free pizza from 1pm to 4pm only!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for awhile recently took a break and I've been on Pizza Hut kick for no reason at all, tonight I came back and I was greeted in a way that will make me choose to come here more often, the guy who placed my order not only did his job but he was more kind & started a conversation that made the buying experience worth more than the food, great group of guy's work here & the pizza tasted perfect!"}
{"text":"I order from this place a lot and it's always been very good. The family loves it, I usually get pepperoni and sausage, regular crust with parmesan topping. The White Cheesy is always a good choice, the cheesy bread is awesome. I've had better pizza, but, for the price nobody else can touch Marcos"}
{"text":"Marcos pizza is a amazing pizza shop. Not only did the lady of the phone give great service. The pizza is excellent. I ordered delivery and it was really fast and hot. This is my new favorite pizza!!!  My family is a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas? YUP!
i have spent four years looking for pizza that dose not suck. its a problem out here apparently..........
i ended up with a large pep. and some cheezey bread. 

lets review the pizza.....
peperoni with crispy edges, check
perfectly cooked, check
right sauce to cheese ratio, check
Parmesan goodness on the crust, hell yea!

the cheesy bread is perfect too just the right amount of fluffy cheezy goodness.

if you dont like this pizza you club seals in your spare time. but i guess everyone needs a hobby."}
{"text":"The Best Take-Out Pizza Joint around. Always has the best customer service and smiling faces. They aren't in my delivery area and I'm more than happy to come pick up a Pie!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. This place was so small and my sons elementary school was having a spirit night. Lots of people standing due to lack of tables. We moved a couple times to different tables due to an ant problem on the other tables. They could've cared less. Mediocre all around, go at your own risk"}
{"text":"I actually love this pizza, but their app keeps double charging. I was ok the first time because the called me and apologized. But it has done it three times since. I don't want to keep having to follow up getting my money back so when it happened tonight and she tried to tell me it inly charged me once when it showed up twice on my bank, I cancelled. I am done."}
{"text":"Did Marco's North Olmsted get this recipe from LE CORDON BLEU School of Culinary Arts in Paris? 

If Jacques Pepin and Eric Ripert decided to open a pizza joint---what I ordered is what they'd serve.  I can just picture the two of them (SO admire their cooking skills) working that blistering-hot oven, taking orders over the phone in their heavy French accents...maybe even delivering?  (Ripert, yes.  Pepin, no.)  Enough of this silliness.  But MAYBE on some new reality cooking series, say \"Master Chefs vs Fast Foods\"?
.

                            Marco's Specialty Pizza---
      DELUXE UNO 14\" large crispy thin cheese pizza

Truly sensational.  One of the very few GREAT pizzas I've ever had.  From-the-first-bite GREAT---and only got better.  Nothing I'd ever expect from a chain---and nothing I'd ever expect from a CRUST.  Took me by total surprise.  It was like a 14\" CRACKER---not a typical pizza crust.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings were exceptional in flavor---but that cracker thing would take getting used to.  Very good, but for my preference, I knew that if I waved it the next day to soften it slightly---rather than the usual warming/crisping in the toaster oven---it might be PERFECT.  It was.  

The DELUXE UNO has cheese, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green pepper, onions, and extra cheese sprinkled on top.  This is not one of those piled-one-inch-high-and-crowded-with-toppings pizza.  It has a lighter handed treatment---but makes up for it very well with sensational flavors.  (Especially that sauce and cheese.)  For lack of a better word---a more \"refined\" style of pizza, hence the tongue-in-cheek Le Cordon Bleu.

Wow.  I'm totally impressed.  I don't eat pizza that often---maybe because they never tasted as good as those photographs wanted you to imagine.  NOW---pizza will become a more frequent, welcome, and an honestly looked-forward-to option.   I love Georgio's North Olmsted for their plain cheese \"fresh n' ready\" that I always add my own toppings to (and will continue to order), but since trying Marco's Deluxe Uno---that's two favorites---I've absolutely no interest in trying any other pizza place.  All those pizza fliers I used to save---just in case?  Right into the recycle bin.  Done.

{"text":"Second time at this place first  time was so filthy now looks little better food still sucks and most of all  I hate is they r rude poor customer service for sure order over 50 bucks to dine in and guy telling me they don't have public bathroom or place to wash my hands they sending customers next door bud not to tell them they dining here what kind shit is that it's not worth one star I would give minus 5 stars if I could lol"}
{"text":"Just opened and boy is the pizza great.  A awesome value at lunch, 10\" pizza or sub and drink for less than $6.  My son tried the wings the other night and rated them so so but that might be just because they just opened. I rate them certainly the best of the chain pizza restaurants.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Received a coupon for a free 12\" 1 topping pizza in a mail flier.  So why not?  I ordered mine with Italian Sausage.

With a min $10 for delivery I guess I'll be picking up.  They are just a couple blocks away, so not a problem.  While they have 'Dining in', I'd advise against it.  It's a very small shop with just a couple tables and chairs.  Clearly not their preferred service.

The pizza looks good.  Pretty simple.  (It is just sausage.)  Not overly cheesy and the crust has a nice golden hue.  Not overly cooked nor under cooked.  So far so good.  The sausage isn't something I'd call home about.  Pretty simple.  Maybe they could add some Spicy Sausage to their menu?  The cheese is good.  No piles of oil forming over the pizza.  The sauce is really good.  I nice bit of flavor and spread thin.  This keeps the dough from getting soggy and limp.  A big plus there.  As for the dough.  Not bad, not bad at all.  I'm a big bread lover.  So it's important that the crust is good enough to eat.  And Marco's delivered here.  No need for crust enhancements here.

All in all I'd recommend Marco's for a quick pizza pick up."}
{"text":"This place is great. Always good service, and their delivery guys are clean cut and professional. We use them all the time. Kids love their pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is actually pretty good. My review is on the incompetent staff. A few weeks ago my family and I were together and ordered TWO THIN crust pizzas, we got 1 thin, 1 thick. We were angry but brushed it off thinking it was a one time thing. 2 or 3 weeks ago I, myself ordered a thin crust, and it arrived thick. Now I'm very angry. I called and talked to the manager (I believe her name was Olivia). I told her what happened on both occasions and she apologized and said she would put a $30 credit on my account. I called last week and ordered a pizza again and told the person on the phone there should be a $30 credit on the account...of course it was no where to be found and asked to talk to a manager. I talked to Olivia again, she said she remembered and apologized the credit didn't save onto my account, she put it on then. I ordered a MEDIUM pizza and she told be there was a $13 credit left on the account....*side note HOW THE HECK is a MEDIUM PIZZA $17?!?!? Anyways, so tonight my family was together again and we ordered two medium pizzas and they said there was only a $5 credit left on the account....now how the HECK does a medium pizza cost $25?  Pizza is good but this place is ran so poorly and no one has any idea how to do their job that I won't order from there again. Save yourself the reoccurring headache and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So I order from here a lot because it's very yummy and close to the hospital where I work. But I had a negative interaction with a woman who shares my name! 

Michelle who works at Marcos: if you were having a bad day, it showed in your customer rapport. Did not appreciate your unnecessary attitude & distain for helping.  

Customer service is very important for regular customers!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Fresh ingredients, amazing sauce. Cinnamon bread to die for!!  #amazing"}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time tonight. We had it delivered and it was hot and fresh! Some of the best pizza around here! Definitely recommend it and will order again. We called to place the order and we had a lot of questions, at least my husband did , the person on the phone was very helpful and friendly. So glad we tried it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Pizza was pretty good. Better than some of the chains around here. Only downfall was the mushrooms were canned or jarred. Fresh mushrooms would have been nice."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite pizza in town. I only order Marco's when ordering in. The deep dish is delicious and their cheesy bread sticks are awesome!"}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place until about a month or two ago when someone ordered it work. I tried it, and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was! 

Today, we ordered it again for the office. 8 different kinds, two of each. Every single one looked wonderful! I like a simple pizza, so I went with the standard pepperoni. The pepperonis were perfectly crispy. The crust was just the right density, not too tough, not too chewy, just right. And the cheese - it's perfect. Very flavorful and they don't skimp. 

The office is pretty much plowing through these pizzas so I think it's safe to say it's an overwhelming approval. We will order from them again!"}
{"text":"Very good food when we go there it all way very food we like the pizza and wings. Try it you will like it"}
{"text":"Not sure about some of the other experiences but I have seriously never had anything but perfect food and excellent service.  Have been ordering from you guys for about 6 months now and have never had any issues.  The only thing that happened one time was our order somehow was converted from delivery to pick up when we placed it online.   They immediately fixed it and even brought us an extra pizza, above and beyond considering it wasn't even their fault. I would give you guys 10 stars if I could.  Drivers are always friendly and quick, food is always hot and taste great.  Food quality is way better than the other chains in my opinion."}
