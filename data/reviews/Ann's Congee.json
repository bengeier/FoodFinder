{"text":"It wasn't as great as all of the reviews stated but the lady was so nice I will try it again."}
{"text":"This place is in the same plaza as Hockey Sushi, and as others have noted there's no washroom so ideally for quick bites, or takeout. The quality of food is great just like what one can expect from Congee Wong or Congee Queen. However I don't think the taste was significantly better than those two established congee franchise, with the exception of the chicken congee. What I think that makes this place \"better\" is the down to earth owner Ann who was so polite in answering questions, filling up the tea and frequently checking up on how the meal was. As for price I find it to be a tad cheaper than Congee Wong and Congee Queen so next time when I want to pick up congee or quick stir fry I will definitely visit Congee Ann again!"}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with a large menu.   Food is excellent.  Had the seafood super bowl which was chock full of seafood and one of the best congees I've had.  And I've had congee everywhere including China. Had the ma po tofu which had a nice sour hint from the seasoning.  The best dish was a spicy chicken with green onion which had crispy morsels of chicken, thin slices of ginger, hot peppers and lots of green onions.  It was impossible to stop eating this dish.  This place is a little gem.   They focus on delivery and take out because of their size and we'll try that next time but staff are so nice that eating on site adds to the enjoyment.   Given how new the restaurant is - less than a year old - I can only anticipate great things in the future."}
{"text":"Large size portions generous ... delivery service slow albeit on weekday dinner ... 60 minutes instead of 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Great takeout place for good Cantonese food. Menu has a wide variety and all items are of decent size quantity wise."}
{"text":"I've never rated a Chinese restaurant before because I've never found one worth rating or even worth wasting a meal at! But this place is very different. The chef knows how to cook! Flavourful food without excess sodium or oil. I asked for no msg on anything and they accommodated and the food tasted fantastic. Every other place that omits msg completely lacks flavour. This will be the only Chinese restaurant I will eat at!! They deliver as well. Found this place thanks to other yelpers!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Ordered a bowl of congee with fish fillets and a plate of pan fried soy sauce rice noodles with beef. Both are very good.Their congee is the real deal, better than other Congee \"something\" chain restaurants elsewhere. Definitely will come back to try their other dishes.   MInd you, the place is small with only a few tables. Take-outs would be a better option on a busy day."}
{"text":"To the woman that picked up the phone when my mom called and hung up immediately after she said a word in Chinese... you're a special kind of something that's for sure. At least next time respond with, \"sorry I don't understand\" etc because she speaks English and would've gladly switched to English. This was our very first time trying to order from here and will definitely be the last. Ridiculous, rude service."}
{"text":"Best Congee I've had in the GTA!! Small little spot, you might miss it if you blink. Three tables of four and one table for two if you're dining in. For takeout, it's a crazy popular spot. So many people came in for their takeout orders during the hour and a half we were there. Service was excellent too. This place runs like a well oiled machine.  We had the veggie congee, ginger shrimp fried noodle, fried dough fritters (because what's congee without fritters!) and the deep fried tofu.  My partner is from Hong Kong and a congee connoisseur...and he was really impressed...we'll be back most definitely!!"}
{"text":"this place is actually freaking good . had dinner here with my family and i'm pleased to say that this small family joint was legit. the service was incredible , the food is worth the money . we got the dinner (B) combo and it feed the 6 of us for only 60$ . we also added another dish to the order . the bill came up to 78$ but still had to bring food home ! please keep in mind that this place is very small and only has about 4 tables.   but overall the highlight part of this dinner was the \"water\" yes hear me out . the water here was actually refreshen ! usually chinese/congee joints would give you those lukewarm lemon dirty looking water ! well not here ! when we asked for water they did not disappoint !!!   highly recommended ! will be back !"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery and they messed it up. When I called to let them know ,they said they reviewed my order (which they didn't) and I said ok. They didn't offer to exchange it or anything . All they said was there's nothing we can do about it. Definitely my first and last time ordering from them."}
{"text":"First impression was \"did I come to the wrong place\". It's a very small place. Can seat 12 people but 15 people maximum.  Food is great, authentic, and fast. Congee and fried rice was really good and lives up to the name.  Owner is really friendly and really caters to your preferences as long you mention it.  Quiet place but cozy. Lots is deals as well"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and good portion.  Good variety of choice even for vegetarians. Reasonable prices.  Owner is nice & friendly.  Ample parking in a plaza."}
{"text":"I'm a regular and bring my family and friends here. For me it's consistently amazing. You got to order the pepper beef, mixed bag with garlic and sweet and sour chicken. All to due for. A real hidden gem that has amazing chinese food. Oh you also need to try the rice noodle with beef in soy sauce,  deep fried pork chop, chicken corn soup. So much great dishes to mentioned, I tried them all so many times and it's always great."}
{"text":"Small place but wow, super authentic , I eat alot of Asian food in Markham and scarborough but  this place actually puts it on top. It's definitely better then the usual congee queen or keungs congee by far."}
{"text":"We visited this place (8 adults) one Friday afternoon for lunch. We were looking to try another Asian restaurant, other than the typical Congee Wong at the Promenade mall.  The restaurant itself is located not too far away from Congee Wong, in the plaza next to Hockey Sushi. It's quite small, and Ann combined two small round tables to seat us. Some dishes are priced higher, whereas others are priced lower than Congee Wong. But all were delicious! We order the Soy Sauce Thick Flat Noodles with Sliced Beef, a congee dish, a beef brisket dish, calamari, and fried rice. Overall, the bill came to about the same as Congee Wong, if not slightly more expensive.  I would definitely consider take-out from this restaurant next time. The packaged combos are certainly worth the price!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner and amazing service! Ordered take out but was still welcomed to sit down and have tea or water. Prices are good and food is made quick and fresh! Must try!"}
{"text":"Firsts time visit here, and got take out. Cantonese chow mein and stir fried rice noodle and beef. Large size is great value for what you get. I seek out the \"wok hei\" in the rice noodle dish, and it's definitely there. Great place!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we came across Ann's congee as we were running errands in the area.  The restaurant is really small with no more than a few tables for sit-in but Ann was absolutely accommodating to my family of 4.  We ordered congee which was delicious and flavourful as well as fried chilli turnip patties and beef rice noodle.  The portions were huge and prices are very reasonable.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We decided to pick up some chinese food on the way to our NYE party so we decided to use our handy Yelp app. The reviews definitely didn't lie as Ann's Congee was deeeeee-licious! This is a literally a mom and pop shop that takes pride and love in their cooking. It tasted so good and was almost comparable to our Congee Star (other fave Chinese resto). They were super busy but still managed to prepare everything within 40 mins. We ordered Yeung Chow Friend Rice, Black Bean Beef Ho Fan Noodle, Fried Chicken Wings, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Salt and Pepper Squid. All dishes had so much flavour and they didn't cheap out on portion size either. With prices these days for Chinese takeout, for the total of $50 it was reasonable! We were also thoroughly impressed with the service. The lady on the phone who took our order informed us ahead of time that would take 45 mins for pickup since they were so busy. She greeted us when we walked in and thanked us for waiting. Would definitely come back here if I am ever in the Vaughan area."}
{"text":"Been here for takeout multiple times and every time the food is solid and filled to the brim of the box and people are friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good Cantonese restaurant. The food is delicious and the server/owner Ann is a very friendly lady.  Wish they had more seating as there was only four tables in the restaurant as we were eating. The boiler, or whatever at the back of the restaurant made a bit of a noise as well. But other than that, the place is perfect if you want authentic Chinese food.  Very interesting to read that the owner used to be a server at Congee Queen across the street. Good customer service and tasty food go a long way. All the best to her and her business!"}
{"text":"Just checked out Anne's and it was awesome! I went with my son for an after school snack, we had the fried calamari and double garlic chicken which were both delicious. Had a very nice chat with the owner Anne who is a lovely lady. She told me they will always customize to my taste which is great, I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. The lady who works there is extremely rude and disrespectful. I have been going there for a year now and I work in the neighborhood I guess as it was walking distance from where I work but unfortunately this is the height of bad service and it's not just me I have seen her behaving rudely to many customers. She definitely needs some training and has to learn how to acknowledge and respect customers otherwise she is gonna lose so much of business."}
{"text":"We have really enjoyed ordering takeout from Ann's. We appreciate the very fresh authentic preparation and flavours, they don't cheat on ingredients; good size shrimps, abundant proteins in dishes, abundant sauces kept separate from fried noodles, good size spring rolls, etc. We previously ordered from Cynthia's and became frustrated with incorrect orders, missing items and inconsistent food preparation. They just don't care as much!"}
{"text":"We were doing some shopping at Promenade Mall in Thornhill on 02 February 2018.  I was in the mood for some Congee!  It was 13h15 a Friday afternoon.  My husband googled Congee on his mobile, and up came Ann's Congee, a two minute drive away.   However the drive took about 7 minutes as Centre Street is under construction.  Living in Toronto, we are used to construction!   Anyways, it is in a small strip plaza, the convenience store had a sign up, For Lease, but what the heck?  I wanted some Congee.  There it was, Ann's Congee.  When we opened the door to enter, I believe some people would have turned around and walked back out.   It certainly was small, there were four tables, one table for just two people, another table for four people and the other two tables for about 6, but 8 could squeeze in!   One of the tables was close to a sink that isn't being used anymore.  It was quite the sight to see.  We took a seat at the largest table.  One other table was full, and after us, six guys came in and sat at the other large table.  They were all house painters, and they needed chairs from the table we were at.  No problem.  In came more people, however they were all there to pick up take away orders.  The first 15 minutes was quite chaotic.  When Ann finally came over to take our order, she was quite apologetic.  I had ordered the Pork & Preserved Egg Congee, $5.95.  My husband ordered the Shrimp Wonton Noodle in Soup, $5.95.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I would go again in a heartbeat. Although a bit small, this restaurant serves really great tasting food and provides excellent service. I ordered the Empress Fried Rice and green peas with XO sauce (?name) and it was delicious!  This place only has about three tables to sit, but it does accept cash and debit/credit."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and quick! Amazing chinese food hidden gem must go. It  small dinner but room to sit and eat ."}
{"text":"Smaller restaurant mainly for take out with a few tables. No fancy decoration but clean and friendly service. Lots of food selection and you can tell that all the dishes are prepared right away. Food tastes good and the price is right. Take out is the better options for bigger group."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall definitely worth trying! Don't let its small space and lack of decor fool you -- the food and service are great! It's a mom and pop shop that has a killer turnip dish, general Tao's chicken, fried rice and noodle, fresh veggies and much more. The portion is huge too! My fiancé and I ordered 5 dishes thinking a couple of them are sides and would be small but they were entree size."}
{"text":"New Chinese restaurant.  It's small inside, but the food is good.  Better than the nearby Congee Wong.  The curry squid balls, lobster e-fu noodles, free-range chicken, and chicken/salted fish fried rice are excellent."}
{"text":"This place is a very solid 4-4.5 out of 5 stars easily.  This is more of a take out restaurant versus a restaurant with take out.  In total there is probably seating for a total of 13 people, though that does not diminish the service at all.  We were served by Ann herself, who we happened to have the pleasure of meeting first at congee wong. Ann as always was very warm, welcoming, attentive and accurate. Her service, in terms of a Chinese restaurant is pretty darn good (often times I find HK style restaurants consistently lack in service), but Ann makes sure your taken care of.  In terms of food, we found out that the chef also happens to have worked with Ann at the previous place mentioned, which would explain why there are quite a few similarities in terms of menu, as well as some new welcome additions. Again, the food seems to be as good, if not better then congee wong. So if your a fan of congee wong, or any of the other numerous congee places in Toronto (congee queen, congee wong, mr congee to name a few) you will also be a fan of Anns congee, though there is the added bonus of Anns excellent service. And as I mentioned, the food is as good, if not better then any of the named restaurants.   This little place is a very welcome addition to this area, though I wish they had a full restaurant. But in the mean time, this is a nice little 'mom 'n pop' style place and is definitely worth a try if your in the area.  As an added bonus, Anns Congee is even cheaper (by a dollar or two) for each dish that she makes vs any of the other mentioned congee places.  Good service? Good food? Good price? C'mon now, need I say more?"}
{"text":"There is something about Ann. She remembers her customers and is very welcoming. So happy for her that she now has her own place! We've seen her over the years dating back to Chiu Chow Koon (I miss that place) over 15 years ago to Congee Wong and now at Ann's Congee.  Tonight was actually my second time having takeout from Ann's. The last time I was under the weather and so I didn't want to write a review then. I will say that the spicy calamari on that date sure helped my sinuses!  Tonight was: Beef with snow pea leaves - delicious Ma po tofu - just spicy enough and so yummy House sticky rice - so good and apparently an off menu item so you need to know to ask for it.  I am certain that we will go to Ann's many times in the future. I'd love to see someone so hospitable gain success now that she is out on her own."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. We ordered congee and fried rice and it was well made. It was super delicious and also cheap. The only downside is there is that it's a tiny place, so it's best to do take out."}
{"text":"Note:  Restaurant is dated and very small.  There are only 4 tables, so not the best atmosphere for a large party.  Based on my observations, this place is more suited for takeout than dine-in.  We ordered 3 dishes:  Grouper fish with sweet corn (on rice), Stir-fried ho fun with beef and black bean sauce, & turnip cakes.  ALL 3 dishes were huge in portion.  According to server, turnip cakes are made in-house and stir-fried with scrambled eggs, shrimp, and were a bit spicy.  All of the dishes were above average in taste.    The only lady who served us and worked up at front was quite friendly!  Bill was just under $30, including taxes for those 3 dishes.  So pretty affordable!  The only other thing that I must add is that the ventilation system isn't that great.  So be prepared to leave smelling a bit wok-y."}
{"text":"Amazing affordable Chinese food. This hidden gem, Despite its unassuming presence in a random strip mall with limited dining area, was lucky to dine in with no one else seated. The host is super nice and hospitable and made recommendations. 4 dishes with plenty of leftovers came out to under $40. All dishes were on point. When I'm in the area again, would definitely visit again. Much better than those large 'congee time/wong/queen' in terms of value and taste."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through Yelp and wanted to give it a try. It's literally a block away from Promenade Mall.... It's in the plaza where the No Frills is. We were so surprised when we entered the restaurant to see the super nice waitress we used to see at Congee Wong from the Promenade Mall. It was a pleasant surprise!  The restaurant is quite small, about 4 tables, and is mostly catered to take out. The menu is similar to Congee Wong. We ordered our usual favourites/staples on a night out for dinner: lobster and fried noodles, sweet and sour pork, garlic sauced bok choy, and salted fish fried rice. The food was great, and service was wonderful from Ann. I actually like the salted fish fried rice here more as there is more salted fish bits, yummy! My grandmother would probably love to visit the owner here as she has been so kind to us over the years, but we will most likely be doing take out as there are no washrooms available. Anyway, I will definitely come back here for the delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place! What a gem.   The customer service is amazing. The food is amazing.   I ordered a fried rice. Chicken wings. Squid. All worth every penny. It was soo good.   I love that it is a small place and secluded."}
{"text":"Very cozy little restaurant, friendly staff. Amazing food and good portion. Salt and Pepper Pork and OK Crispy Beef is a must try."}
{"text":"This humble joint over here was so close to landing my top most hidden gem list, but that would be selfish to the entire world if I were to continue with my devious plan in calling Anne mine and only MINE!!!!  Anne's charismatic smile and warm approach can welcome weary travellers into her establishment and then sending them off with a burp and sigh of 'goodness gracious, that was effin good!!'  Party trays here had me covered over the crazy holidays, $150 worth of grub was estimated at a million dollars after the free time gave way to a full day at the spa and coming out like a sparkling pearl and still being hailed 'QUEEN OF HOSTS'!  Notable trays: empress fried rice-so moist and when drizzled with hot sauce, even the next day it tastes fresh, soft and the bursting fish eggs between your teeth remind me that the simple things in life come in silver trays!! $38.99 and a mountain full of silky goodness can be served to my rice loving filipino, hispanic family who can pair this with everything!!!  Fried squid tentacles and spicy vinegar with a side of mango salad (my recipe) and BBOOOOMMMM, ladies' night is ending with bad breath but a good time!  Anne, thank you for gracing us with you and your crew's passion in Cantonese dishes that continue to please many for generations to come!!!"}
{"text":"Food is the best, very affordable we ordered food for my son's  birthday, they delivered on time and the food is still warm, Anne herself made sure that everything was taken care off and  Anne's Congee exceeded my expectations!!! Our guests love the food!!! Will highly recommend!! Thank you"}
{"text":"This is such a great and quaint place! The food is exceptional and has a very awesome fresh, homemade, and made-to-order taste that makes it a lot better than most other places. The portions are also Huge for their price and we always have to pack some to go. The owners are also super nice and friendly and will look after their customers right. Amazing discovery!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem in Thornhill. The first time I tried their food, I was I shocked with how big the servings were! In addition, the food taste amazing. Seriously. I go to Chinese restaurants all the time, and this place is definitely a top pick of mine. I would recommend the: Cantonese noodles, Szechuan beef and Singapore's shrimp. Lastly, Ann (one of the owners), is a sweetheart! She always recommends the best dishes and has such a great personality!"}
{"text":"So excited to have this restaurant just around the corner.  Ann is very warm and welcoming and genuinely sweet. She greeted us at the door and took our order, she let us know that delivery was available and offered to take our address and information for future deliveries.  Food is your standard Chinese takeout but made with some extra love. We tried the lemon chicken, fried rice noodles with beef and salt and pepper chicken wings. The wings had a spice that we weren't crazy about but the lemon chicken was crispy and lightly breaded with a delicious lemon sauce and the noodles were fresh and flavourful. The portions are large enough to share and we had more than enough food for 3 people.   We will certainly be going back when we need a lemon chicken fix. They also have some other dishes that we'd like to try before settling on a regular order. The price are good for the quality and you feel good giving business to someone like Ann who is so appreciative of her customers.   Lots of parking in the plaza, the restaurant itself is very small and can only accommodate maybe 7-8 people at a time, more of a takeout place."}
{"text":"this place is a gem  it was a solid 4 stars for food quality quantity reliability and speed of service . the owner calls you by your last name which is cute  but after a year ordering from them they deserve a 5 star rating because they have only improved on pam the above !! the quality is better and it was great before   slight increased but still fair prices for excellent food  we order delivery and assume food even better at small cozy  restaurant"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a meal. Food is fresh and flavorful. The best Chinese food I've had in Vaughan. Cantonese Chow Mein and House Special Fried Rice were delicious. Fast service and pleasant people. I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times. The foods not bad. Ill even overlook the fact that they were cited by the York Health Board for numerous infractions. Hopefully these were corrected!! But, boy, the ATTITUDE!! It was as though they were doing me a favor by taking my money. Im a pleasant person. No need to be out and out, plain rude!!`  (Public health inspectors handed out tickets for violations under the province's Health Protection and Promotion Act at four York Region food service providers. * Ann's Congee, 2 - 1102 Centre St., Vaughan, was charged with failing to protect food from contamination or adulteration.)"}
{"text":"Congee is yummy.  Good price good food.  Recommended the congee and beef with rice noodle.  The owner is super kind and nice. If you not sure what to order. She will suggest the best in store.  Place is very small, only few table inside. Take out will be best place for this restaurant because it don't have washroom here."}
{"text":"Maybe I came here with high expectation after reading all these 4 and 5 star reviews?!   I would recommend Ann's Congee as a solid takeout place for some decent Chinese food in the area. Love the huge menu and the selection they offers. But the \"restaurant\" itself is really small. I would not suggest dining in especially if you are a group of more than 4 people. I do prefer Cantonese food serves right from the wok to the table as wok hay is really important.  Chicken Congee ($5.50) was quite good.   They also have lunch combo that you can order from chalkboard in the restaurant.  Ann the owner is really nice. Her friendliness give this place a really homey feel."}
{"text":"???? ????? ??pork liver ????? ????????????????????????love the food here especially for the pork liver congee and noodles"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp when I was craving for some Chinese food. Ann is a nice lady and her smile cheered us up right after we stepped in. We ordered beef noodle soup and couple of other dishes. All are good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The large dish is really big and could feed you for 4 meals at least. I chose the mixed vegetables chow mein. Price is fair."}
{"text":"I came by Ann's Congee after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp. The restaurant is pretty small, with only 4 tables. Behind the counter is the kitchen and you will often hear what sounds like a garbage disposal (I have no idea what it is) going off every so often.  The menu is pretty extensive. There's a TV that display specials. On Sunday, you can receive free egg rolls with orders over $15. I ordered the seafood super bowl congee, the stir fried baby bok choy, the house sticky fried rice, and the fried calamari. The congee comes in a very large bowl and it was very tasty and just as good as any congee I've had in the past. The shrimp in the congee are large and taste fresh. I enjoyed the house sticky fried rice, which is not on the menu. The peanuts are so tasty, but the preserved meats make it saltier than I prefer. The fried calamari was also tasty. It had a little hint of spiciness and a bit salty. Dinner always came with a dessert. On Chinese New Year, I had a gelatin cake with goji berries. On a separate evening, I had fruit.  Ann is super friendly and very talkative. She remembers repeat customers."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty.  Spicy chicken with ginger and scallions was out of this world. Ma Po  Tofu really tasty..  Congee Seafood SuperBowl has hint of ginger which was nice,   and good amount of seafood.  Service prompt and personable.  This is a tiny restaurant, newly opened and deserving to be a success.  Definitely on our list of favorites.  They do take out and delivery, really only four tables, but if you score one it's worth eating in."}
{"text":"Ann's Congee is a newcomer to Thornhill, but its staff are old-hand at Chinese cuisine. The chef is an import from the nearby Congee Wong, and the server/manager is the eponymous Ann, who has been graciously serving me and my family in local Chinese restaurants for literally decades. It's wonderful to see her finally set up her own shop, and the results are about as excellent as you would expect.   The food selection represents all of your usual Cantonese favourites, and is executed well. In a recent take-out order, I had three types of rice, and a vermicelli noodle: all tasted fresh, and each was flavourful without the attendant undertones of MSG. Portions are large, so it's good value for your money.  Restaurants are about both food and people. This one has a long backstory, kind proprietors, and the earnestness of an independently run business. You should try it."}
