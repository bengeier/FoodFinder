{"text":"I am not sure what the earlier reviews are talking about. I eat here once a week and always have great food and a lot of it. Service is consistent to all Asian restaurants. Key here is the food is great."}
{"text":"Sushi has no flavor. Everything tasted the same and that is't a good thing. Expensive, poor service and bad food. Do yourself a favor and go to the sushi counter at Harris Teeter. You will be better off."}
{"text":"High expectations and unfortunately highly disappointed.  Given the pricing at this location and the type of food offered, one would believe that the quantity and quality would reflect the price. Unfortunately, it does not.   Based on other reviews, the location is well appointed being in a new location in Fort Mill, SC that is lacking in the restaurant and food scene. However, there are other nearby Asian/Sushi restaurants that are worth the drive for a better experience such as Baxter, Pineville, Uptown, etc).  The restaurant interior is cold and uninviting and actually very odd. It is not inviting and the tables and locations are very open.  With all this being said, I think the pictures of the recent takeout we received proves my point. Salad contained a lot of water, noodles had no taste, fried and white rice tasted the same, etc."}
{"text":"Food was superb, ordered hibachi dinners and they were delights. Customer service is why my review is only 2 stars; the music was awful- NOT family friendly....servers dancing around and singing so I will assume they chose the music. Staff louder than the guests. Does not seem to have management. Will order take-out next time."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Food sits on the shelf for what seems like forever while they prepare the rest of the meal. Was served cold hibachi chicken that was plated 10 minutes before they served it.  For $18.95, I at least expect it to be hot"}
{"text":"2nd time there for lunch. First time had sushi and very good, though napkins were dirty. 2nd time had hibatchi vegetable and was shocked at how small the portion was. Food came to table 10 minutes after my lunch partners did - no appology for delay (how hard is it to make vegy hibatchi?)  Spring roll came 5 minutes after that. Staff seemed unorganized. Will probably not go back. Again, small portions and no appologies for delays!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but it is too expensive - my lunch today with small tip was $17.17 (and I drank water) - that's WAY too much for lunch and the proportions are SMALL."}
{"text":"Dinner with the wife here last night. This is just ordinary asian fare comparable to the Red Bowl chain in the area. I had chicken lo mein that was decent but a portion too small for the price. Wife had orange chicken that was cooked too hard and hardly any orange sauce on it. We had a cali roll that was ok but wrapped kinda loose and it fell apart easily. The staff is nice, friendly and seemed capable but the quality of the food is lacking. I can't recommend Cherry Sushi & Grill and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The place was almost empty for  dinner, but we wanted to give it a try.  The miso soup was ok, and the small salad had a pleasant fresh dressing.  We didn't like the plain fried rice; texture and flavor were lacking.  As it seemed a slow day for the restaurant,  we didn't want to order only sushi.   We ordered the Bento Box  and the Hibachi chicken.  The chicken had a delicious smokey sauce. The noodles  looked strange,  like fine spaghetti.  We ordered green tea and it was awful. A  teabag in warm water that tasted strongly of chlorine.  Service was pleasant and they corrected the mistake in our check manually at our table. In summary, our experience was average and a  little bit expensive for what we ordered."}
{"text":"Good sushi and hibachi. Love the hibachi noodles and the hot kiss roll! Restaurant is fairly new so they are still getting use to things, can't blame them for much."}
{"text":"Over priced for average food (hibachi). Traditional soup and salad is bland. Not relaxing. Friendly service was fair but no drink refill offered. Prices are too high for the quality, atmosphere and service and no \"chef show\" :)"}
{"text":"I keep giving this place a chance and after four visits my experience is too much of a trend for me to think something will change.  I just came to the conclusion that I do not like this place and will not go back.    Like many of the other reviewer's have already stated, the service is poor, atmosphere is odd, ambiance is lacking and the food is just average at best.  Last night I sat and watched as two employees were embracing each other in the kitchen.  It was weird, lasted longer than it should have and is not something I want to see going on in a food preparation area.    In looking at other reviews, I suspect that this place will be short lived unless the owner takes serious action to right the ship. If you live around Springfield, convenience is the only thing they have going for them right now."}
{"text":"Not bad. My wife and I liked it. It has a few vegetarian options which was just what we needed."}
{"text":"Good portions, albeit a little pricy. Sushi was done very well, presentation of the dinner was top notch, flavors were astounding. Wish their General Tso was a little spicier, as I ended up chewing the accompanying peppers for any hint of heat, yet generally all around well done.  There appears to be a type of problem with asian-themed diners, in general, however. Their soda is always flat. I cannot recall the last time I went to an Asian restaurant and received soda that was properly balanced. Odd. Perhaps worth noting. Their tea was adequate.  Update: Ordered takeout on a weeknight, and all rice sides were coated with hair. We joked that a cook used it to wash their scalp, but that isn't too far off. Very hit or miss. Customer beware."}
{"text":"I've given this place for tries. I give up.   Waitstaff.  2 stars.   Slow service.  Checked her phone more than she checked on the tables.  Hostess - nice but sat at a table staring at her phone  Food. 1 star     Kani salad -  terrible    Strings of Fake crab smothered in mayonnaise.  Yuck     Clear soup. -  no flavor (this is not like clear soup and other places)     Spring roll -   It was hollow!   Fried wrap with nothing inside.        Edamame was ok    Some were dried out     Chicken hibachi - over cooked and hard  I sure hope they can turn it around."}
{"text":"Pretty good so far, compared to the other sushi places I tried in the area! Everything we had was fresh and even the hibachi was good. The only downside was presentation. I really wish the chefs cooked out in front of you like other Places do that serve it"}
{"text":"I was quite excited about trying the food at Cherry Sushi & Grill, and so was my fiance. We had been watching their construction and couldn't wait for them to open. Well tonight we had take out, and i was not impressed. My boyfriend had a couple of different sushi rolls which he said where ok. I had the hibachi chicken and a side of rice. I would have given 3 stars but not even 30 mins after finishing our meals i was running to the bathroom. When i got my chicken it was cold, smelled odd and tasted rubbery but i ate it anyways because i paid $13 for it..which I am now regretting because it has upset my stomach...BAD. I have had hibachi chicken at tons of places but have never gotten sick after eating, which im assuming i was served bad chicken. I was really hoping that this place would be 5 stars, but no one should be running to the bathroom 30 mins after finishing a meal."}
{"text":"Costumer service here is really bad, i stood up and left after the food was served, the pictures on the menus don't belong the the restaurant. What i ordered was not the same as shown on the menus picture. The waiter told me they did not have what the picture shows even though the first waiter said they had it when i placed the order. They got into an argument with me even though i am the customer and did not offer to change my plate. So as i said i just left and i will never comeback"}
{"text":"The sushi was good and fresh. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great little asian place! Featuring really nice sashimi, nigiri, and hibachi! Sit down outside or take out. Nice little bar too. The staff is super friendly, but I really love how clean and fresh everything is and the price can't be beat! Definately going in my rotation for a fast quck sit  down or take out meal. Yay!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Great service and tasty food. Spicy tuna roll was great and Hibachi steak was very well seasoned and tasty combined with brown rice.   Update 5/27/16 brought the family back for dinner. Everyone really loved their food, and great service."}
{"text":"Probably won't be back. I had high hopes for this place! The atmosphere is nothing to crave. The country music chosen is a bit odd for this kind of place. I am waiting for my food, so this will make or break my decision of coming back. If I do, it will be carry out."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience here tonight. The food was amazing, the service was friendly and attentive and the kids loved it. We had the sweet and sour chicken, edamame and spring rolls- all very good. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi in Fort Mill.  And their hibachi noodles are a joke.  I was given spaghetti noodles with soy sauce.  No garlic, no onions,  nothing.  Just spaghetti noodles bathed in soy sauce.  I'd suggest you go two mins down the road to Lee Cafe."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and my mom- not exactly tech savvy- had seen this place many times driving by and wanted to try it. It's the first time I hadn't checked yelp reviews first and I wish I had! We had the avocado salad, spicy tuna roll, sweet potato roll, veggie tempura, veggie hibachi and tofu hibachi. The food was okay going down but as soon as we left the restaurant, our stomachs started hurting and we were both sick by the time we made it home. It's not like we were sick cuz we ate too much because there was a lot left over that we ended up throwing out in fear of getting sick again. I do NOT recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"One of our family's favorite places.  We always get right in and good is delicious!  Surprised by some of the negative reviews since we have been here several times and always have a good experience.  I love the hibachi, husband loves the sushi rolls and kids love the fried rice & lo mein."}
{"text":"The restaurant only opened two days ago and service isn't what it needs to be yet. Overall the quality of the food is good."}
{"text":"my best thoughts of our visit would be adequate......, nice place, server was quick, but no personality and was leaning over everybody......food was, buffet quality......i wondered when on a Friday evening, everything around it was packed, and they were empty....."}
{"text":"Really hopeful about this place since there is no restaurant nearby  to my home in Springfield.  Was counting on having a \"Baxter type Market Street\" and am definitely disappointed.  The sushi was good and hubby had the Sesame Chicken.  Both quite tasty but a bit expensive.  Server was attentive although the restaurant was not busy on a Monday night. Probably will not return because the buy one get one free sushi deal at Akahana in Baxter is too good to pass up; plus their portions of Sesame Chicken, dumplings, lo mein, etc far exceed Cherry's portion.  And Akahana has a full bar in contrast to Cherry's wine/beer selection.  Maybe adding a full bar along with reasonably priced sushi will be in the future?  And more full service restaurants in Springfield Town Center?  If so count me in!  In the meantime the drive to Baxter will continue to be my preference."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews here. They made us hesitant in trying this place.  Our gluten free family of 7 thoroughly enjoyed both sushi and kitchen items. Our waitress was knowledgeable about gluten containing foods at the restaurant.  The fish was fresh, veggies fresh, friendly and attentive staff. We will definitely be back.   Tons of variety from meat eaters to vegans. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat and chill. Been here 3 times. Food was amazing. No complaints at all. Japanese hibachi Chinese food all in 1 place. That too good quality and not pricey at all. What else do u want. Amazing special sushi rolls. I haven't had a bad experience yet. Great staff and service too."}
{"text":"Dry chicken, replaced with over cooked shrimp.  Sushi was coming apart, fair flavor.  The dim sum was light on stuffing.   Good fried rice though.    Friendly staff but a little slow. Had a coupon for free entree with purchase of one, only took $3 off a roll instead of the other $4.50 roll when i got a &12 Bento box.   Was hoping for better.  Ahh well."}
{"text":"Glad I ignored the yelp reviews...this place was good!  Sushi is by far some of the best in the Fort Mill area (definitely way better the red bowl).  We brought our 2 young children and they even had a nice kids menu.  Everything we got (including the kids food) was delicious.  The kids got tempura and hibachi...both excellent.  The adults had sushi which has to be the freshest and most delicious I've had locally.  We got one that had mango (which isn't my favorite but the wife likes it) and it was a really delicious roll.  All the flavors married together so nicely I would get it again despite the mango being in there.  The place wasn't very busy for a Friday (probably because of these reviews).  I certainly had a different experience than most on here."}
{"text":"Me and wifey had a taste for sushi tonight and decided to meet here. I got to the restaurant first and went to the hostess desk. When I walked up she kept her head down, eventually looked up but continued to do what she was doing. Another party walked up from the bar and this hostess looked around me and asked them can I help you. I was very surprised she DID NOT acknowledge me at ALL. She went and sat the party then came back and asked can I help you. I don't know her name but she wore Purple or Raspberry Low Cut Converse. Hard to tell color in low lit restaurant. Our servers name was Savannah, she did a pretty good job and was very accommodating. The restaurant was very busy so I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt on the slow service. The food was just OK, the sushi we had was very good. I will probably go back and give them another chance because of Savannah's service. If it was not for her I would probably not go back. Wifey said she feels the same about this visit but she has been here a few times before today with friends and said she received pretty good service during those visits."}
{"text":"Cherry Sushi did not impress me at all. The service was horrible. My brother ordered miso soup which he never got. I ordered the tri-color sushi which comes with miso soup and a salad. When my brother's two sushi rolls and my dish arrived, I realized the waitress brought me the wrong dish. She brought me the tri-color sashimi instead of the sushi (nigiri). I had to show her on the menu that these were two different dishes and that the nigiri was supposed to have rice with the fish. Then, I inquired about the miso soup we had ordered (since it should have been out before the main dishes). I got the soup and salad after that, but my brother did not receive his soup. However, after tasting the miso soup, I did not bother asking about his again. The soup was the most watered-down, flavorless miso soup I have ever tried. My brother was done with his dish before my correct dish arrived. On the plus side, the nigiri was pretty good. The sushi rolls were alright. I had also finished my drink before we got any of our food, and my drink was not refilled the entire time. My brother's drink was not either.  Upon getting our check, I saw that we were charged for two miso soups. Since my brother never got his and mine came as part of my meal, I had to ask to get this removed. However, my dish was listed as the tri-color sushi (not the sashimi), so at least that part was right. The pen I was given to sign the receipt with was out of ink. That was no big deal, just the icing on the cake. Overall, horrible service and terrible to good food. The price range was pretty average."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Won't be back.  I sat there forever before a serve came over. It wasn't even busy. I ordered the Bento Box and I have to say one good thing is that it's a lot of food. It came with Tempura shrimp and vegetables, rice, gyoza, sushi roll, soup, and salad for 12 bucks. Great deal. The sushi didn't taste fresh and it was kinda hard, like it had been pre-made and  refrigerated.  The rest wasn't bad, but wasn't great either . Just run of the mill. I expected a little better. So, no second chances here. I don't even have pics to show. It was that ordinary."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was ok.  We love the location in Lake Wylie and decided to give it a try. Food was on par but the ambiance was terrible!  Feels like a subway station.  The waiter was clueless.  Our appetizers came AFTER our main dish. Who brings the hot food before the sushi?  Like 10 mins before the sushi!  I think it could be a nice place if they trained their staff."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad just overpriced.  The Lo Mein noodles were spaghetti with soy sauce.  There were little gnats on the table.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Pretty average sushi I had the Snow White Roll was good but not $12 good and the House salad was very small. My husband had the Green Dragon said it was too sweet tasting but he enjoyed the Hamachi Roll. I was still hungry so ordered edamame that was good and good sized portion. Staff was friendly and place was clean three stars due to price being high for what it was."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch. Service was good and the sushi was also good. I opted for the lunch special, choosing three rolls for $12. The rolls were good, well assembled and tasted fresh.  The restaurant is clean and there's plenty of space. Lots of parking as it's at the opposite end of the lot from the Harris Teeter.  I'm sure I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Service is just weird! The staff is inattentive, strange, almost annoyed that you walked in the door!! Food is just ok They will not last long with this kind of service! Very disappointing"}
