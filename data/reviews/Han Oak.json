{"text":"I used to go to this place when it was California Sushi and get the salmon teriyaki bento box for take out. I went there today and noticed that they had changed the name, and presumably the owners, but it looked the same and the menu was basically the same so I ordered. They said they didn't have salmon, so I ordered the chicken instead and it was $10 flat, while the salmon I used to get was a little over $11, so it made sense. When I went back in 15 minutes later, they had it ready for me but I noticed that it wasn't packaged up in a plastic bag with the small styrofoam cups with miso soup, rice, salad and the little plastic container with soy sauce, like they used to do. I asked her about the miso soup, rice and salad and she said that was an extra charge if I wanted it. It has always been included in the price, and especially because I used to get all that and salmon instead of chicken for only about a dollar's difference, I didn't think that was right but I took the food and left, thinking I'd just give it a chance. I was very disappointed with the food. The chicken was awful, I had to spit out half the chicken that I put in my mouth and the other half you could tell just by looking at it that it was inedible. They put the rice underneath the chicken, which I don't mind but they put only about a quarter of a cup's worth, it was such a sad amount. The gyoza was pretty good, very standard \"all you can eat\" sushi place kind of gyoza. The california rolls were okay, but they were mostly just rice and very little anything else, not to mention they didn't have any take-out packets or even little cups of soy sauce. In conclusion, I will never be back to this place. I'm very sorry to say this because I went there when it was California Sushi many, many times and it was my favourite sushi place for take-out. I can't believe they even charge $10 for the garbage I got. So disappointed with them, it makes me sad that I'll never have my favourite bento box meal ever again."}
{"text":"This place is a staple amongst Korean families, and definitely a hidden gem.    The lady who runs the restaurant is very kind and polite, and they keep the place cool on hot days (like today).  For a restaurant known for their Beef bone soup, they were QUITE busy on a fiery hot day! All tables packed and a line-up for takeout definitely means something.  I come here regularly and if you're looking for korean soups, this place has the best Haejang guk (hangover soup) and beef bone soup in the city.  Their kakdugi (radish kimchi) is the best too!  Also tried their Galbi for the first time today and it is VERY tasty and meaty, but be warned, their marinade uses lots of sugar (altho super tasty)."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to try this location out when we saw this from the outside, we were excited to try a new restaurant that serves authentic Korean food. So I order the chicken cutlet and my boyfriend order the beef bone broth soup, I was so disappointed when I saw the chicken cutlet but still gave it a try to see if the taste is okay. The chicken cutlet tastes like cafeteria frozen chicken patties or maybe worse. I couldn't even finish it so I left it. My boyfriend said the soup was just average or borderline average. Definitely not coming back here"}
{"text":"Came here the first time because their specialty is sullung-tang (white beef bone soup). It is truly one of Korea's staple dish and I LOVE this soup as I grew up with it from my childhood.  This dish here at Han Oak is hands down THE BEST in Toronto. There is another place by Sheppard and Yonge called Yi Nam Jang but nowhere near close to this level.  I think it is comparable to the best Sullung-tang in LA and that is a big deal.  Now, my review may be biased as this dish and ground bean stew are the only things I tried here and this 5 star rating has lots to do with my childhood nostalgia + this beef bone soup dish being the best in Toronto at Han Oak but none the less, I'm sooooo glad that I have a place to go to to eat sullung-Tang in Toronto! Please stay open!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Han Oak is  small family owned Korean restaurant. The menu is quite limit but their specialty is Beef Bone Soup Seolleongtang .  Grand Opening Special $8.99 instead of $10.99.   I usually into spicy soup but I was glad that I have to non spicy version. The soup base is milky, creamy and full of flavour. No seasoning needed but you do have the option to add pepper and salt. There is always quite a few slice of beef shank and pieces of tripe.  So comforting and hearty for a rainy wintery day.  Banchan though quite limited but for Han Oak's soup is the star."}
