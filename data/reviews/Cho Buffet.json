{"text":"New name, worse food. It's pretty terrible. Food isn't even kept warm. The pasta had clearly been out for hours and was dried up.  The hibachi was under cooked.  The ice cream was the most ok part. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The name was changed from York to Cho but layout is pretty much the same. Overall I thought York was better with respect to the sushi (more fish & better selection), buffet was OK but I liked the York version better, used to love that u could get some interesting ice cream flavors out of the buckets and now they have middle school cups. Service has always been good and price has remained reasonable. I will probably NOT go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine & I stopped for their Saturday lunch buffet 1/21/17.  Not knowing what it was before and what the food was like I went in with an open mind.  Everything looked very clean and orderly especially for a buffet, someone was constantly wiping the mess that people made and filling the supply of food that they where offering.  All of the food offering are very nicely displayed as well. Most of the employees couldn't speak English but tried hard to help.  Everything that I had was excellent!  The salmon was cooked just right, the mussels / little necks where excellent, the peel & eat shrimp good flavor, the green beans where just like what I used to get in Boston, the fried rice very good, sushi beautiful presentation and very good. Great selection of soups and lots of deserts.  Some American dishes but didn't try them since I went for Chinese.     The food was hot enough for me, but I don't like things that burn my pallet like some do.  Plus if they keep it to hot it would dry out and so you can't have it both ways.  Lunch was only $8.99 you can't eat at McDonalds for that!  My friend never says anything is good and she liked it! Everything is it's ok or not a fan... but here they got a \"it was really good\"    I heard a lot of people there saying how good it was so it wasn't just us.  We liked it so much we are going to have a group event there with about 20 people.  It's a buffet so they have to somewhere in the middle, it's not cooked to your liking.  I say try it.. I know I'll be back"}
{"text":"Looks like they're reopening with a different name...  :D"}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as the previous buffet that was there (York).  Food is not kept very hot. The General Tso had no \"kick\" to it.  Some of the food isn't that bad.  Still like the vanilla pudding/vanilla wafer dessert along with the bananas in some type of red gel like glaze.  They now have ice cream or sherbert in individual cups to choose from.  Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Visited this \"Sushi\" buffet on Monday 3-13-17 only to discover that they have shut down the sushi area \"permanently\", according to the waitress.  Yet they are still charging the same price for lunch as if the sushi area is open.  In the Hibachi area the noodle water was not clean.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Not a wide variety in food. The food they do have tastes like it's been sitting out for a while, not very hot. Chicken was extremely dry. Won't be back."}
