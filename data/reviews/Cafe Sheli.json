{"text":"Their bagels are delicious and they have a great variety of food on their menu, although it seems to be best for breakfast/brunch.  Their omelets were great, their pancakes & french toast were average, and their wraps looked delicious but I didn't get to taste any so will have to rate that next time.  Decent service, little bit on the expensive side but nothing out of the ordinary for kosher food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Israeli platter.  First, while there are variations on Israeli salad, true Israeli salad (referred to in Israel as arab salad \"Salat Aravi\") is composed of cucumber, tomato, onion (all diced) parsley, lemon juice, olive oil and salt. Nothing else. Cafe Sheli uses peppers and lettuce which is more akin to a diced garden salad than an Israeli salad.  Next, the eggs. Scrambled eggs seem to be a huge challenge for many restaurants to accomplish. Their's were typical, but not done right. Typically, restaurants serve what amounts to chopped up plain omelette. This is not scrambled eggs. Cafe Sheli, if you're reading, send your chef back to school or watch Gordon Ramsay do it right: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0  Next, the hash brown. Rather than make one, they buy those toaster sized ones at the grocery store and deep fry them.  The cream cheese was also store bought, or so it tasted.  All in the meal was clean and service was great, but at $10, even for kosher, it wasn't anything more than a breakfast anyone could make at home, shopped for at the grocery store with zero creativity.  I give it 2 stars. Meh, boring."}
{"text":"Nasty woman on the phone. She was so beyond rude, and kept arguing with me. I asked her about a certain platter, and made the mistake of telling her how many people I was hosting, and she told me that I need 5 platters. I kept asking her how much the platter was and she kept insisting that i wasn't large enough. Her rudeness got to a point where I ended up just hanging up the phone. The food in there is also vile. I just called them because I needed a kosher platter. Never will I call again, or visit. All the times I have visited, the food was awful."}
{"text":"Heathl food done well. And with flavour.  I was very impressed today. The food (their version of an Israeli Salad) was full of colour and just the right amount of chic peas. Yes, chic peas; its their version after all.   My daughter ordered from the kid's menu (grilled cheese). For $6.99, I was very impressed with size of her kid's meal. Everything, including our milk shake, all tasted fresh. Nothing reheated or frozen and thawed.  I was impressed. I will return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for average Aroma-isque food but want to pay a premium ... Go to Aroma and leave a big tip. This cafe outside promenade has a big menu of Israeli food, baked pastries... And sushi? What? The eclectic assortment of food aside, I had the salmon burger and my gf the tuna wrap. Was it okay? Yup. Was it something that I could have been confused with Aroma? Definitely.  The food quality aside, I was most dissatisfied with the service. People who came after us were served first, we felt rushed, and we were the only table that they didn't leave a water jug for. Sounds petty/silly I know. But if I'm paying to eat at a restaurant I expect to be treated on par with the other patrons.  Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Thornhill, signing mortgage documents (tip: don't drive to Thornhill from downtown at 5pm.  It's soul crushingly slow) and ended up having dinner at Cafe Sheli (lit: \"My Cafe\").  I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  I expected typical bakery-restaurant food like mediocre sandwiches, etc.  But the food was really delicious and the menu quite large for a dairy-based cafe.  We shared the Jerusalem platter, which was much larger than we expected.  Six perfectly cooked falafels (super crispy and crunchy on the outside, light and melty on the inside) served with passable hummous, roasted veggies, pita and a salad.  It's listed as an appetizer but could easily be a meal for one person.    Mains were equally huge.  My oriental salmon salad was terrific and much better than I expected.  Generous, well-cooked salmon tossed with stir-fried snap peas, baby corn and other veggies on top of a green salad and served with crispy noodles.  It was perfectly seasoned and almost a little smokey - as if the salmon had been BBQ'd.  My husband got the penne Arrabiatta (his standby), which was also super tasty and served with generous cloves of roasted garlic and a nice amount of spice.  Service was great and they even had benchers available for the birkat hamazon!    Vegetarian score = 8.5/10.  Hooray for kosher dairy restaurants.  There was tons of choice for my husband and all generous and tasty."}
{"text":"Foods OK  Basic food. What you would expect to see on any dairy restaurants menu.  The 3 star rating is for poor service.  Service never seems to get my order right, even when the restaurant is close to empty.  Also no one smiles or says thank you.  I little bit pricey for what you receive."}
{"text":"I don't like it here. the line ups are long, the service is slow, the prices are high and I am not impressed with the menu.  The wraps are kind of nice.  I usually just stop in to buy bread from occasion, but you can't use debit for less than 10 dollars.  the employees are nice though."}
{"text":"Wrap are great.  The service is slow and not always good."}
{"text":"One of the better Kosher places. Most of the food is good and the service is kind and fast!"}
{"text":"Meeting my Hot Yoga Date at Cafe Sheli for lunch but got stood up!   Cafe Sheli is so busy during lunch rush. Packed with people and the tables here are set up so close together, I can barely squeezed through to get in and out of my seats. My waitress cannot even get near to my table, my food, cheque and everything was passed to me over my next table...??   Menu selection is good, this place would have made any vegetarians happy. Where is my Hot Yoga Date?!   I ordered Portobello Sandwich with side salad ($10.99) and Mint Lemonade ($3.99).   Grilled Portobello with Goat Cheese and vegetables in a ciabatta bread Mmmmm, Love the bread! Price wise is a little pricey but quite delicious!   I asked the waitress if their Lemonade is house made...and she reassured me that it is fresh. But it tasted suspiciously like the one I got from supermarket... and for $3.99?? Skip!   Don't expect excellent services at Cafe Sheli. You get decent food at a premium prices in a cafeteria like setting!"}
{"text":"The place is definitely very busy during a Sunday brunch! That said, they were able to accommodate our group of 9 without a problem (very open to moving tables and chairs around!). The food was okay. The home fries were quite good (nicely spiced and very hot on arrival) however, the cheese blintzes were not impressive. I am personally a big cheese fan and these felt more like cream blintzes than cheese. That said, it's possible their other dishes are better (my friends seemed to like their orders)."}
