{"text":"I give 2 stars because we still had fun. We went for New Years, I had low expectations. I wasn't surprised... For 75$ the menu was a joke! Wine list is mediocre... but everyone got drunk and had fun, so it is what it is. Way overpriced... it's in the old 40 North location, maybe they think they serve same
quality? I confirm they don't. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was going to give it only one star but then my husband had the chicken and really enjoyed his meal.

We walked into this restaurant because our first and second options were already full and it was a last-minute decision to stay for dinner in the area. We were a group of seven which also limited our options.

Have to group ordered some appetizers which took about half an hour to come to the table. The waitress brought some bread which was the equivalent of half piece of bread per person and it was really calculated it for seven people.

The soupe du jour was the best part of the meal. I did taske the chicken and it was good too. It took way over an hour to get our plates, which we got after a table who got there after us.

I had the fish and chips : did not like the batter, and the fries were not that crispy. I also thought that they gave little tartar sauce ...

Two friends got the double tartar: it is a very generous plate with actually 2 complete portions of tartare. They unfortunately just seemed to have pour in too much sesame oil, and both tartar kind of tasted the same thing.

My other friend got the duck, and thought that the Costco duck(the one you cook from frozen) was better than his plate.

There was a singer to entertain, he wasn't great but did put an ambiance and made us laugh.

I would go back to this restaurant. The service was okay. They did make sure several times that our glass of water was full and asked us if we wanted to order another bottle of wine as soon as we finish the first one."}
