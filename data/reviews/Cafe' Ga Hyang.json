{"text":"Very inventive side dishes! Persimmon kimchi is out of this world! The owner makes it herself. Awesome"}
{"text":"This place is super tasty. And it's actually open til 2 Am. I loved the dumpling soup I got and I love all the pickled sides that come with."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious. The food was phenomenal and the service was attentive and quick. My boyfriend had his old stand by, bul go gi, and I had bi him bop (mostly so he could try it so I can broaden his Korean food horizons).. and they were both great. The ban chan (side dishes) were varied and had some authentic items that you don't regularly see in other Korean restaurants in the Valley. What I'm really excited about and can't wait to go back and try is the other menu items such as cha jjang myun (delicious noodles in black bean sauce) and cham pong (spicy seafood noodles)... These are also items rarely seen on a menu outside of k town."}
{"text":"Your place is amazing. Really good food, when I lived in the area I went there twice. Amazing both times. I just love how authentic your food taste. Idk what else to write to you but it's amazing. Great job!"}
{"text":"Food was above average good. The service was very friendly and kind. But this tax issue other post mention is true and really weird. I asked the manager about the inflated tax and she seems suspiciously koi about it.  To compensate for the extra tax they charge, I lesson my tip. We drove 30 mins here and not quite sure I'd make that drive again for somewhat average food."}
{"text":"Check your bill!! My boyfriend and I only ordered one dish and we put both our cards in the receipt tray. She charged both of us full price for the dish we split!! We were out with friends, so we didn't catch it until we got home. Wish I would've caught it in time...I would have said something!! It's just wrong!!"}
{"text":"This is Korean food with Korean Chinese dishes as well and it's my favorite place to go! If I could go more often I would but it's a bit of a drive for me. This is a small restaurant and is a bit dark, but the service is fantastic, the food is even better, and the prices are exactly where they should be. I've been all over, looking for a place like this and it fits all my expectations! This place is a gem and it's got great hours too! I highly recommend this place and so far, all my friends, coworkers, and family enjoy coming here, even though it's out of the way for most of them. If you're feeling spontaneous with trying new dishes or need a familiar taste of, gourmet, street fair plates or feel good foods from Korea, you should come here!"}
{"text":"The most terrible service I have ever had, the actress's attitude is awful, order so slowly, if you separate you bill, she gives long face to customer, and this time I find a bug's wing in soup. I would never come here again."}
{"text":"My second visit to Cafe Ga Hyang confirmed everything about the first visit: 100% authentic Korean cuisine! It's as if I was back on Korea going for lunch on a lazy day off. If you're looking for the real deal on Korean food, then put Cafe Ga Hyang at the top of your list!"}
{"text":"Yes.
I tried their dduk man doo guk (dumpling and rice cake soup in anchovy broth) -- AWESOME.

Soon doo boo is pretty good too.
Spicy tofu soup.

Their dduk bokki (spicy rice cakes) are SPICY and yummy.

Yook Gae Jang -- spicy broth, beef, clear noodles, veggies.
Spicy and yummy!

Jja Jang (soy bean paste noodle) and Neng Myun (spicy buckwheat noodle),
first few bites were good but then I got kinda tired of it.

Their sidedishes are well flavored.

Would recommend."}
{"text":"I want the original chef who went to LA to come back and make the awesome foods.

Never mind guys, the new chef's dishes were awesome too !"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cafe Ga Hyang for a few years now for Sunday lunch. 

The lady running the place is always very nice, I've never had any problems with service and have not seen anyone else have anything different. 

The food has always been well-made, even when I've ventured into unfamiliar territory and ordered entrees that don't fit my personal taste.

The food may take a bit longer to arrive at times, but it has never been an unreasonable amount of time for a restaurant. 

Favorite dishes: neng myun (cold noodles), jajang myun (black bean noodles), kalbi dolsot bibimbap (vegetable rice-bowl with beef served in stone bowl).

All of the side dishes are tasty, I haven't had a bad one yet. The gajajorim (glazed potatoes) and the spicy cucumber dish are my favorites."}
{"text":"My all time top favorite Korean places to go to. Great side dishes and Sue is such a sweetheart. I always order the Jap Chae (sp?) and it is really great! try it if you haven't had it yet. You wont be disappointed. Also Open very late which is always great"}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible! Went there last night for Korean food and the lady server was so mean to us we had to walk out of there while waiting for our food.

First of all, when I asked her about the menu and what her recommendation was, she was like \"What do you want me to say? Just order what you like.\" 

OK, shook my head and ordered. Then we asked for ban-chan and she said she is not going to give it to us until we get our meal and that we had no common sense. She tried to give us a full lecture about how traditional way of eating Korean food should be. I did not go to this restaurant to get a lecture from this lady. I am Korean and I know how to eat Korean food! 

I have never received this kind of customer service in my life and I really think this lady needs to learn the basics of customer service. I'm from New York and I thought at least the people would be nicer than this. This is truly a shame that she treats people of her own kind like she did. 

People, be aware of this restaurant and go to Ohya restaurant which we went to after we escaped this hell hole. The customer service was amazing at Ohya! I don't know if the food might have been better at Cafe Gahyang but I certainly do not want to eat at a restaurant that has a kind of service she provided. Good thing I don't live around this area so I don't have to think about going back there LOL"}
{"text":"I have eaten here approximately four times and was initially drawn to their amazing haemul pajeon (seafood pancakes).  The food is actually decent.  However, I have to take issue with the uneven service i've experienced there.  The last two times i've been there with my fiancé, the service was questionable.  

The first time, the owner seemed to want to get us out of there after we spent a couple hours of dinner and conversation.  She brought us to-go boxes early on and after a while, she came by and quickly boxed our food for us and then slammed the dishes together and walked away without saying a word.  We got the hint but totally rude and unnecessary especially considering the fact that it was not too busy.  

The second time, we ordered two dishes each and noticed that we were given only two side dishes.  Typically there are at least 4, sometimes 5 served with each customers dinner.  I figured they did not have much that night.  As we watched more customers come in and order, i noticed they were getting 5 side dishes.  Bewildered again.  

This was the last time we will visit this café.  I have no beef with the food - i thought it was very good.  I wanted to get it out there that restaurants will lose customers if the service is inconsistent and customers are not treated well...or even fairly for that matter."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat and came across this place.  Great food with great people.  We didn't know what to get and they told us what was best and even showed us the best way to eat it.  The food is amazing and healthy!! This is our new spot and the best part is they're open late!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We were greeted so warmly and treated so well that it set the tone for the evening.  Restaurant a bit difficult to find as it's in a small plaza.  The bibimbap was absolutely outstanding.  Also impressive is the full array of mini tasters that come before the meal. So much fun.  Would highly recommend this."}
{"text":"I love this place. The women who run this place are very nice and will custom make anything for you. Food is really good but if you say spicy, be carefull because its gonna really be spicy. Best tai food i have had."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out a new place for some late night eats, I had just got off work and was craving some Korean food and remembered hearing this place opens late and one thing led to another and boom I was there. I also took along my little brother for his first experience and he fell in love with it. Our waiter which was the owner I believe served us we weren't sure what to order but she definitely steered us in the right direction to some delicious food. We had sliced pork belly that came out sizzling on a skillet over glazed onions.. A type of beef rib soup which was so good I devoured the whole thing.. Also we had another dish which was recommended by her which was pictured at the bottom of the menu, yes she pointed and we agreed. Best decision made in a very long time. 
She also showed us how to eat the pork belly correctly which was very sweet of her. 
And last but not least the sides that comes with the meal was great as well there was a massive selection on the table to choose  from. 
We came there pretty late and were just having dinner I'm not sure how the service would have been with more people but I will definitely come back for the food and the sweet lady that was too kind to me and little brother."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to get korean food whenever I can, having spent a considerable amount of time living in korea and travelling it is always a pleasure to come across a korean restaurant wherever I am.

Cafe Ga Hyang is a lovely little mom and pop place that serves good korean food at good prices. There are no bells and whistles (good!), and yes service may be a little slow but the hospitality we were shown was wonderful.

Dolsot bibimbaps were very well done, and generous too. They are also not stingy on the banchan here, and best of all they are open until very late."}
{"text":"It's definitely The RUDEST service that we ever had. Please be reminded to CHECK YOUR BILLS before leaving cuz we asked the lady to provide the receipt and she said it was messed up with others. Anyway, we won't return to the restaurant for sure and not recommend to you either."}
{"text":"Now there aren't all too many Korean restaurants in the Northern Phoenix area and the ones we do have aren't all too stellar. But Cafe Ga Hyang blows all the others to shame! A small little hole in the wall place, but the food is AMAZING. The first thing you have to judge any Korean restaurant by are the side dishes and let me tell you...they are tasty and well seasoned! 

The champong soup was spicy, flavorful, and filled with seafood. Definitely my favorite of the entire meal! The duk boki (spicy pasta cake and fish cake) was good, but extremely spicy. So if you can't handle your spice then I would not suggest getting it. The jajangmyun (black bean noodles) are also quite delicious though not as good as what you would find in LA. However if you need your fix then I would suggest getting it here! The kung pao shrimp and kimchee je yook bokeum are also good options if you want something stir fried. 

Though we ordered a lot there are still many items on the menu that I have yet to try (though I'm sure they are all equally delicious). 

Definitely the best Korean food I've had in the northern Phoenix area. Try it...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Been here a few times and every time the food has been amazing! During 'busy' hours the service can be a bit slower than some like but to me I don't mind the extra time to decided on food and just relax with friends. 

The place itself is nothing spectacular but the taste of the food makes up for just about everything.

I did have the unfortunate experience of not 'eating well' during one of my visits. Its nothing bad trust me, I just found it adorable that the lady said we barely ate anything while me and my friend imagined we ate a lot. The portions are so large with all the added sides, I was proud we could finish what we did!! We had ordered the bul goki, haemul pa jeon, and jajang myun to share. The Haemul pa jeon and bul goki were both divine!! The jajang myun was good but I usually like a bit more 'spice' to mine.

This place is one of my fav. places to go now!!."}
{"text":"I will never return here. I don't have high hopes for Korean food in Az, but this restaurant fell far short of even my lowest expectations. The service was terrible and the food was even worse, not to mention both my mother and I felt sick later that night after eating here. There are better Korean restaurants in Phoenix if you get a hankering; no need to go here."}
{"text":"Gaibe is ok, good flavor, but some pieces were pretty tough. 
The seafood tofu soup is such a big let down. The portion is way to small, and it cost about 10 bucks, seriously? 
And I barely find any seafood in there, just some sad tofu crumbles...

Don't  order the soup, maybe order another bbq dish instead."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE WORST FOOD
This is one of the worst korean restaurant ive been to. First of all, when we went into the restaurant, no body greeted us. We had ask to be seated. Once we were seated and were ready to order, the waitress told us that i have to wait for a LONG time to get jjajangmyeon. We asked how long and she said she didn't know since shes not a cook. Are u kidding me?? So i changed my menu to jjampong and she said the same thing. Jjajangmyeon and jjampong are their \"special\" menu and i cant believe  i couldnt order them..!! i might have been extra angry since im pregnant but if i knew i couldnt have them, i would have went to another restaurant. So i was looking through the menu to see what i can order and she said if i werent ready shell come back. I was taking 30-60secs to decide and she couldnt even wait that long. She convinced me not to eat jjajangmyeon and seemed annoyed to even serve us. That made me really mad so i said no wait and ordered bulgogi. Then It took her really long time to bring out the side dishes. When she brought rice, her finger was inside the bowl..!!!!!! OH MY WORD..... this made my husband angry. When the food finally came out, my husbands dish-spicy galbittang-was blend. My bulgogi was burnt. Bulgogi is one of the main dishes in korean cuisine and if a restaurant cant cook well, then that restaurant has a problem. What made everything worse was that at the end when she brought the check, she was friendly all of sudden..! She asked if the food was okay. I wanted to tell her the truth but i didnt want to talk to her so i just said its was ok. She also told us that we should call 15mins ahead of time if we ever wanted to eat jjajangmyeon. She said their jjajangmyeon is very delicious. Duh thats why we were there. I wanted to try their jjajangmyeon but i will NEVER go to that restaurant again."}
{"text":"No go. Roach alrert! Really last time i went there and there was german roach literally crawling over my table my wife n i was freaked out so i killed it right away and asked to worker and they said \"this is not a food roach! This is a flying roach. It's totally fine.\"(which is same shit anyways.) And Tried to made us pay the food. I was like wow. Paid the food. No tip. Never going back there.

To the onwer. If you see a pest going on. Dont just shove them to ground. Actually care about it."}
{"text":"I love the food it's so traditional as well as the atmosphere! But no korean alcohol!?? I wish they had it. it would complement their food!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  At first when we pulled in we weren't to certain about the place based on first impressions.   The server was friendly and attentive and the food was served quickly.  Three entrees ran us about $45 with tip.  We had enough left over for the next day.   Each dish was tastier than the one before it and this is a must visit for authentic korean food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, feels very comfy and cozy. However, The soup was pretty tasteless. I would not recommend this place especially not after finding A light brown Thin, straight HAIR IN MY RICE. i knew for a fact that it was not my hair because i have dark thick curly hair. I confronted the waitress about it and she simply said \"oh, sorry.\" And returned with a new bowl of rice. I Definitely lost my appetite and desire to ever to return to this place again."}
{"text":"Late nite junkie KTown cravings bring us all the way to the west side of town to hole in the wall Cafe Ga Hyang! As if entering your fave K-auntie's dilapidated hut of a dining room, we find comfort food that soothes your Asian soul. Best spot in AZ for sure!

Upon a sip of the mugi-cha, we are always swept back to memories of summer days back in Tokes. We thoroughly enjoyed the banchan dishes; faves being the daizu moyashi sprouts and marinated potatoes on top of flavorful kimchees. 

Hubby was drooling for gochujang flavored anything really throughout our Man of Steele date night and he was beyond satisfied with his kalbi dolsot bibimbap. I always order jap chae and sul lung tang cuz typically I'm halfway full from the bancha. We still had enough for leftovers and I'll be happy to heat up my leftovers for work tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Talk about \"hole in the wall\"....this place is just that. Whenever I eat KOREAN BBQ I always get Bulgogi. So far this place beats them all in Phoenix. Coming from LA you expectations are high for these types of foods. Well this little place definitely left our bellys full and our palates happy! I'll most definitely be coming back. 

The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because of the outdated decor. Other than that nothing went wrong. 


Plus good to know that they are open till 2am..that's so dope:)"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and vegetable appetizer which should be called vegetables with two shrimp. My wife had some soup (koren name - can't write it) but she liked it. Young man took our order and didn't know what bulgogi was- working in a korean restaurant and don't know bulgogi??? Took 20 min. to get our check after we asked for it."}
{"text":"My second time having Korean and it met my expectations. The place looked a little dark but service was good and also food. I will recommend."}
{"text":"So incredibly happy to have found this place! Yay YELP!!!!  My husband and I come from NJ/NYC area where good Korean food was plentiful.  Since moving here to Arizona, we have had such difficulty finding our ethnic restaurants, including Korean restaurants. Thanks to the fellow yelpers, this small mom and pop restaurant was exactly what we were looking for since we have made our move.   And I must admit, the soft tofu soup with seafood (Haemul Soon Du Bu) was better than the ones back home.  The bimbim bap was also amazingly delicious, as was the spicy squid with veggies (Oh Jing Uh Bokeum).  The Banchan (little dishes) also hit the spot as they were all equally tasty and spicy.  The service was great and we love our waitress!  In fact, she informed us that within a couple of weeks, they will be receiving their liquor license along with karaoke.  I don't care much for the bad singing, but I am happy to be drinking Soju soon and have some Bonchon (fried Korean chicken) to wash it down with...WINNING!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Our first  Korean experience. Banchan was awesome. I had the Dolsot Bibimap, she had the Pork Bulgogi."}
{"text":"We came in tired from a long drive from Grand Canyon. But we were not even greeted.. after being seated they didnt come get our order until we finally got their attention.. they rudely told us that what we ordered was not available.. A young child in our group asked the server if he can borrow a pen to play games on his napkin while waiting for the food. She snatched the pen from his hand and walked into the kitchen. An elderly woman in our group asked for water with no ice. Server rolled her eyes and never came back with the water. Of course our food came out really late. Seriously I've never seen such rude service straight up in our faces.. overall the service was so so bad. It put us in a bad mood before we even ate the food."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends for dinner after reading many of the yelp reviews.  Overall, the food was decent but overpriced (although the prices were in line with many AZ competitors).  The banchan was good, roughly 8-10 dishes as other reviewers have noted, but it took about 30 minutes to make it to our table.  Also, there was a refusal to refill any of the banchans (abnormal for a Korean restaurant).

I ordered solleungtang, which was decent.  I would give it a 3/5, there wasn't much beef but the broth was okay.  My boyfriend ordered dolsot bibimbap which was below average in comparison to Gogi in regards to portion, quality, and price. My friend ordered jjajangmyun, which was clearly from a jar and not homemade.  Further, her meal arrived roughly 15 minutes after the solleungtang and bibimbap.  

Bottom line: below average on quality, quantity, and price. It gets 3 stars because there isn't much selection in AZ.  If this was located in CA, it would've gotten 2 stars or less."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go here for my birthday dinner and i'm glad we did. I'm a vegetarian and had trouble finding any options on the menu, but upon asking whether or not a dish had meat in it, the two ladies who were working as waitresses took it upon themselves to help me pick a dish that could be customizable, and specially ordered the noodle dish vegetarian and without any meat. It was a totally sweet thing for them to take the liberty to do. All of the food was fresh, delicious, and most of all - authentic. Definitely the best Korean place i've tried not only in the West Valley but as a whole."}
{"text":"Had my first real authentic Korean food at this restaurant (I don't count the packaged rice and noodles brought in by the 4 Korean baseball players my family hosted for the Jr. Cal Ripken World Series back in the early 2000's). I was a little hesitant because not too many people were there, maybe because it was a Sunday... Nonetheless, I had a wonderful experience. The food exceeded my expectations by far. Everything my partner and I ordered was fresh and served in a timely manner. We loved it so much we came back a week later for more! Overall, service was great and the atmosphere is intimate. Portions can be split between two people, meals are decently priced. I can't wait until I move to Arizona so I can have some more of their Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is yet another restaurant that my grandmother and I visited. I had extolled about the virtues of Korean for the past year since returning from there in September 2K11, and eventually we decided to go here. The restaurant has a real cozy atmosphere and the people who run this restaurant do an excellent job of waiting on you as well as being very friendly. 

We both had the bulgogi bi bim bap and the man du guk w/ sliced rice cake and they were just as good as I remembered. This restaurant does everything right and it makes me glad that I am able to find a restaurant here in Phoenix that serves excellent authentic Korean cuisine.

I have only two minor complaints. 1. The side dishes are a little skimpy even for two people and if you want extra you have to pay more, as opposed to most restaurants in South Korea which mostly gave you unlimited side dishes, and 2. they don't let you do the grilling. You order it and they cook it like most American restaurants do, which is disappointing if that's what you are looking for. Don't let this deter you from trying this restaurant as you'll miss out on some of the best food ever."}
{"text":"So a few months ago I moved to AZ from Los Angeles (korea town to be specific) and have not been able to find a descent little korean restaurant, until now!  What make this place even more special is that they are (or the cook is)  Koreans that grew up in China and are able to cook both, very well. 

The place is new, only in business about 5 month. The owner also owns the AYCE sushi bar in front (which is how I found this place).  For me, walking into the restaurant was like being home.  The first time I went they were about to close but stayed open and make my food.  The owner, Sunny, was so sweet and hooked me up with kim chee and a lot of other side dishes.

I've been back a few time since and have enjoyed it each time.  I'm so happy I found my new little korean spot!"}
{"text":"We ended up here on a Friday night close to 10pm, partly because there aren't many restaurants in the Valley open this late and partly, because we tried it before and found it \"okay\".  This time, I wanted to order the campong; but the waitress made it clear, in both word and facial expression, that it would take a long time to make and it was obvious she didn't want me ordering it for that reason.  That was fine.  I had instead a dish, which basically took most of what is presented as cold appetizers in multiple dishes brought to the table, except mixed together, served very hot on a bed of rice and included an egg and a little meat.  While I do enjoy the cold appetizer dishes, I have to admit, they taste better very hot.  My partner had a soup, which could be best described as pot stickers in broth.  The amount of food was copious and we were quite happy with what we got  (which was not the case the first time we came here).  The fact that neither of us are Koreaphiles and know Korean food doesn't exactly help in choosing items.  For one thing, almost every dish on the \"entree\" page is soup.  While I readily admit that Vietnamese Pho, for example, could easily fill you up, because everything and anything is thrown into the soup, I come from a background where soup is something served as an accompaniment to a meal, not a meal in itself.  So, mentally, a soup for dinner wouldn't cut it with me.  The 'non-soup' entrees are limited and are on the menu's back page; so don't despair if you can't seem to find items that aren't soup!

The restaurant is small and intimate.  There are a few booths made to look like stereotypical Korean \"huts\".  I feel like I'm in a cage sitting in one of them; my partner likes the privacy and cozy feeling they provide.  A TV plays in the background, which might be fine, if you understand Korean.  However, the scenes from a report about some hospital and skin diseases (along with a blurred image of a man doing his business at a urinal) is not really something I want to be seeing while I eat.

There have been complaints on Yelp, that they're not very attentive when it comes to filling the appetizer dishes.  I can only say, that these appetizers arrived after we were sitting a very long time and (coincidentally?) very close before the main meals came out.  Whether this is done on purpose to limit how much of the appetizers you'll eat before your dinner shows up so they don't have to refill it, I don't know.  But the coincidence seems pretty strange; especially considering other complaints about this very topic.

To sum up, while I would enjoy a bi-yearly trip here (six months ... two years ... you choose the meaning!), Korean food simply isn't something that wows me enough to make the effort to make a special trip out here ... especially from the west valley, some 45 minutes away.  The food is hearty; can be very spicy (though I didn't think overly so ... maybe I'm just very used to spicy food); and, let's face it, \"basic\".  I've yet to have ANY Korean food that I'd describe as \"finessed\" or \"subtly spiced\".  That may just be me.  Sushi will always get top billing with me (but not other Japanese food!); followed by Vietnamese and then Szechuan.  Korean food just seems to be something that I find \"collides violently\" with my taste buds and assaults the senses.  As proletarian as my taste in food can be, I just don't find enough variety in taste to make the cuisine something I can get excited over.  Add to that a small restaurant, which is very hot in summer (when we last went), crowded, not cheap and has slow service and my enthusiasm drops even more.

I don't dispute fans, who've written that this is the next best place to Inchon or Seoul in the Valley.  Like I said, I'm no aficionado of this cuisine, so I wouldn't know.  I can only say, my taste buds told me, that this food and the service in this restaurant is more \"Pyongyang\" than it is anything down south.

Acceptable; but no \"wow\""}
{"text":"Food is still yummy! And service is still great! Waitress is sweet. My honey had the Bim bap, his usual and loves it. I had the seafood and tofu stew, mild (u can choose spicy level), yum. And green tea mochi ice cream, hmmm hmm! Next time I plan on having whatever sizzling dish the table next to us had cuz it smelled delish!"}
{"text":"Amazing hole in the wall! This was my first time experiencing Korean food and I went with a classic. kimchi jjigae! Sour spicy goodness."}
{"text":"After coming back from the grand canyon, this was the only place open.
We got there, the atmosphere was great, pretty calming.

We ordered, the wait was a bit long.... But the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Hello again Reviewers,
I been here recently going to give the place another try. Turns out it was a bad pick again. We waited and waited for almost a hour to get our food and ended up leaving without it. Our waitress was by herself and she was overwhelmed with a large group needing a lot of assistance. I ordered regular spicy chicken and my friend ordered pork. We waited first for 30 minutes after ordering, asked about our foods and the waitress was busy just saying 10 more minutes okay. Well 10 minutes passed and we waited again for another 30 minutes really hoping it would be done. Still nothing so we got up and started heading for door when the waitress told us that the pork is still coming just takes a long time to thaw out it's frozen. FROZEN. The pork was frozen and they had none for the night. Instead of telling us that first they made us wait till we got tired of waiting. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Good food but my son in law specifically said no veggies... It came on a bed of onions. We said excuse me we said no veggies she said its just onions.  I and he explained he is allergic to onions and she said just pick off the meat and dont eat the onions... 1. Umm wtf no! 2 thats a serious issue its a persons health and safety."}
{"text":"I've had the kalbi, bulgogi, dolsat bibimbap, haemul pajeon, and the duk bokki over the course of a few visits. All the food and side dishes are amazing. Very authentic and great service. My go to Korean restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a second visit to this restaurant, I must say I had a lasting impression of the cham pong the first visit so I decided to put it in the list of restaurants to frequent. The food tonight 2/26/13 is just mediocre, the soups are more watery than the first time. I ordered the kimchi chigae (kimchi stew) and my boyfriend ordered the cham pong. The middle aged owner brought out only pickled daikon for my boyfriend, and pushed the banchan(side dishes) to my side of the table. That was fine, but my food came first, so I offered some of my sides to my boyfriend who was still waiting for his entree. She threw us a look of distaste.

When we finish some of the sides, I asked for a refill...and she told me \"We don't do refills, it's too expensive.\" Fine, if  she had left it at that, I would have waived it off...but she refilled the sides of the table next to us after she told me that. I've never been to a korean restaurant where they don't refill the side dishes. And on top of that I've never been to a korean restaurant where they discriminate between asian customers and white customers in the next table.

We finished our meal, and asked for boxes for leftovers. The lady shakes her head as though we shouldn't take out our leftovers and reluctantly brings us two boxes. I've never had such poor service at a korean restaurant...and I probably won't be back for this type of treatment."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some Korean food and decided to give this place a try. It's hidden in an old strip mall but once you walk in, it's a nice little place. Clean and well kept. There was only one server but she was attentive. I got the seafood & beef tofu soup ($8.98) while my boyfriend got the bulgogi plate ($15.99). Both were pretty good and my Korean food craving was satisfied. It was nice to see Korean families eating there too - I figure if they eat here it must be pretty authentic. Overall, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I would give this place a full five if it wasn't for some of the service. 

The food? It's amazing. Cafe Ga Hyang is a constant for me, and never fails to satisfy the craving for some delicious Korean food. The menu is a bit pricey, but know that the restaurant does give big portions and there is a 9/10 chance you'll be taking some of your meal home with you. The menu has a wide variety- from basic chicken teriyaki for those afraid to try new things, to japchae and bibimbap and a menagerie of seafood dishes for those who go to the Korean cafe for, well, actual Korean food. The banchan (small side dishes for those who don't know by now) are always tasty and from them I've discovered my love of bean sprouts. My only warning is that if you are new to Korean food, don't try to be exponentially brave. It's always good to ask questions and to listen to the servers- they have served plenty of people and know what they're saying. My first time there I ordered something at random and ignored the advice of the waitress, only to end up eating nothing because the dish was such a surprise to me and I had no idea what half of it was (nor that egg would be in it, yulk). For those who want smaller prices and a smaller serving portion, ask for the lunch menu.. which brings me to my next point: the service.

At first we were offered the lunch menu when we happened to make the time (I believe it's 11 to 2? don't quote me on that), but afterwards we always had to ask. When we did this, it was always an obvious look of dissatisfaction from the waitress before she left to get the menus, or \"just tell me what you want\" and no lunch menu was brought to be looked over. Well.. I was asking for the menu to see what I want to order, perhaps I wanted to try something different? Aside from this, the wait staff is friendly. You get refills often or if it's a busier day, they simply leave a pitcher of your choice of drink and you can feel free to converse without interruption. You always get a 'hello' and a 'goodbye' and if you frequent the place, they do care to recognize you as a regular. As I said, aside from the peeve with the lunch menu, I have zero complaints about the staff.

Last up? Ambiance. I always go when it's around lunch time or earlier in the morning so I've always entered the place when it's quiet. I love that they have the tables out in the open, or the much more private booths. There has never been an issue with cleanliness concerning the tables or the overall restaurant, and the tv's there make interesting enough conversation if you don't know Korean, to where you can try to figure it out (for those who care to be interested in other cultures. I find my brother is irritated with the fact he can't understand but that's just him). It's quiet. Nice. Peaceful. It's an A+ place for conversation and trying something new as long as you don't take an occasional bad attitude to heart."}
{"text":"Authentic? I can't believe people think this is authentic korean food, because IT'S NOT!!!. 

This place is more geared towards chinese style korean cooking. There's no such thing as dol sot(stone pot) black bean sauce dish in Korea. Yes, the black bean sauce is sometimes used to mix in rice. However, the black bean sauce is served as a noodle dish. This idea came from when you order/eat black bean sauce noodles and you have left overs of the black bean sauce,but still have room to eat and your stomach is not content and all you have is rice, you would mix the rice with the left over black bean sauce you have in your bowl. Well, that's fine. Maybe they decided to add something new to their menu....

But that's not the problem, the flavor of each dish is nowhere near what authentic traditional korean food should taste like. Even my vietnamese friend who is in love with Korean culture told me at the table that the seafood Soon Du bu (Tofu) soup was nothing like she has ever tasted. The shrimp they used is wrong. Shrimp that goes in the seafood Tofu soup should have the skin on with whiskers or whatever those things are called on the shrimps head. It maintains freshness of the soup broth and tastes 100% times better. 

The shrimp Ga Hyang used had to be frozen shrimp. They smell too fishy. The quality of the food was not good. The fish cake side dish had the flavor but it was really cold and the texture was dry. The thing that I was most disappointed about  was that my favorite side dish, the soy sauce/viniger marinated jalepeno, was sweet and gross. :( So sad... It should be crunchy and slightly tangy/sour? from the vinegar. 

Plus, it's not that hard to split checks. The lady gave a big sigh and an attitude when my friend asked for separate checks. Why ask and allow it in the first place then? I wouldn't do that in front of my customers, especially if you want them to come back. 

This just made me miss Los Angeles a lot. The korean restaurants in La outbeats any restaurant in Arizona. If anyone knows any good quality Korean restaurants in Arizona, I dare you to recommend me one. 

Till then, I'll have to make Korean food at home or wait till I go back to Cali. 

(I know I'm a harsh critic, but I'm a foodie....deal with it! :p ....and I'm korean)"}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch and it wasn't as good as it has been in the past. I only go for the jajangmyun, and it was disappointing. It was too bland, and just lacking in flavor. They used to offer a gan jajangmyun if you asked, but today they refused to accommodate this request. The ban chan was plentiful, but they give it to you about 15 min before your meal arrives. My husband ordered the daeji bulgogi. It was dry, and also lacked in seasoning. I've definitely had better Chinese Korean food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Spectacular! Best Korean food in the valley. Stop by and eat at this little culinary gem. Authentic fare, reasonable prices. The kimchee soup is a must have!"}
{"text":"So good! Real authentic Korean dining experience! Did not disappoint. The service was amazing and the food just as good! Definitely get the gyoza and the bibambap. Not many places in Phoenix have bibambap so this restaurant is a real gem! Will definitely recommend to friends and would like to go back soon"}
{"text":"It's truly a gem! It's like eating at a Korean family's home. The chef is the owner, she is very proud of her food."}
{"text":"After our trip to Koreatown in LA a couple of weeks ago, we were craving some Korean BBQ! The only problem is we are not in Cali anymore and live in AZ. : ( If you are looking to grill your own meat, this place is not it. However, if you are looking for great Korean food, abundant amount of banchan and friendly service- then come to this restaurant!! We had the sweet n sour pork (not your typical Chinese food sweet n sour entree) for our 3yr old, kalbi tang, and grilled pork belly. In our previous visit we had bulgogi, kalbi, and chapjae. Everything we've tried has been delicious and reminiscent of our experience in Koreatown."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good service then don't expect much from this place. However, if you are just looking for DELICIOUS KOREAN FOOD especially at 11pm at night, then give this place a try! I love that this place opens up so late! 2 AM everyday except for Sunday which closes at 11pm."}
{"text":"Open until 2AM. Great price and food. I will come definitely come back and try many more korean dishes and kim-chi."}
{"text":"I've experienced better. 
Food: we ordered a few dishes (7 dishes) including kalbi and spicy seafood soup, pancake, squid, bulgogi, black bean rice, and the hot stone pot. Kalbi dish was over burn a little bit but last time we were here it was good.
It's Friday night and there was only 1 server but that wasn't much of a problem.
Our dish took a while to come out so speed rating would be around 3/5, could've been faster.
Server was friendly. 
Overall, only negative thing is that it took a while (30-35min) for foods to come out even though the restaurant wasn't busy.
Food: below average - average as compared to other korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very good food at midrange prices. Place is small so if you get a table, do not take it for granted! Family run business, so they take the orders and cook it themselves so do not expect phenomenal service."}
{"text":"Pros:
The food tasted very good. (Bibim bap & duk buki) 
The atmosphere was nice. Had private tables and nice decorations. A unique date idea if you are hungry up until 2am

Cons:
Slow service
Never refilled side dishes or water. Waved for attentions. 
Not the friendliest servers 
Only came up to us 3 times: give us menus,  give us water/take order,  give us food and check. 
Walk passed us but didn't come to us when cup was empty and at end of the table"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very authentic and great service. Best Korean place I've been to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect due to the reviews, but after our meal, I was very satisfied. Our waitress was very friendly and when we first got there it wasn't very busy. We ordered the bulgogi and kal bi bimbimbop. I'm used to Korean food in the Bay area, which is very good, and I thought it compared pretty well to what I'm used to. The little dishes that they bring to you was very tasty and authentic. I would definitely come back and give it 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and I gave it the old college try, but it's a no from me. I came here once for kimchi jigae and was disappointed. It tasted very \"off\" and the banchan tasted old. In all honesty, the food actually made me ill later in the day. I was not looking forward to going back but my friends and I were craving Korean food and it was late so I decided to keep an open mind and give it another chance hoping the one bad experience was just an isolated incident. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The food was just not great again. The bulgogi was burnt and the jajangmyeon had no flavor. On a positive note, the banchan tasted fresh this time so I will give them that.The worst part of it all was that as I was paying to leave I saw a cockroach crawling on the wall. :("}
{"text":"Not kid friendly. No crayons and coloring books. No alcoholic beverages because they lost their liquor licence. No dessert because their freezer was broken. All in all the food was EXCELLENT! My wife had BBQ shrimp and I had the BBQ tenderloin. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. Came an hour before they closed. The waitress was honest about our options. We ordered the duk boki, the bul goki, and the kalbi bibimbap. The duk boki was spicy! I was dying and loved it! Never had it before. The ban chan was on point.  The bibimbap came in a stone pot. It had a crispy rice bottom! Sooo good. The waitress even mixed it for me. I love these hole in the wall places! Would go back again to try the Korean bbq!!"}
{"text":"So I was here for the this months installment of the International Supper Club UYE. I have never had Koren food before. I wondered if I would like it but I am always willing to try new things. When we arrived I questioned if I would like it again because it is in a shady shopping center in a shady part of town. But again sometimes the best food comes out of little run down shops.
When we walked in our large table was all set up for us. It took up most of the restaurant because the place is not that big. We were greeted by what seemed like the owner but was our Koren mother for the night. She was very helpful and explained what dishes were and made suggestions. She even told a few people what they ordered wasn't good for dinner and they should get something else.
We sat down and waited for the rest of the group to arrive. It was growing by the minute as people brought more people with them. We even lost two because it was getting last and still had 15 in the party. Water was passed out in glasses and also large carafes for refills. Menus were handed around and indecision struck. What do I get? Lucky Ursula D was to the rescue and let people know what was good and what she had had at other places. So I picked the Bul Goki which I am spelling wrong I'm sure and still can't pronounce correctly. It is thinly sliced beef with onions and possibly a few other things. All stir fried up. Whatever it was it was really good. Everyones orders started coming out after just a little while and they were all steaming hot. Even with 100 plus degrees outside they were still steaming. Some of up got sucked into the Korean soap opera that was playing on the TVs all around us but the food more than distracted us from it.
All the food smelled good and everyone was raving about it. It made up for the fact that there was no beer to be served and soda was served in a can. The restaurant was very nice and our Korean mother waitress owner was very nice and handled our large group with no problems. Even split the bill up easily. Which can get tough with our group. I will definitely be back to try more delicious Korean food and say hello to my new Korean mother.
International Supper Club UYE has not gone to a bad place yet."}
{"text":"Food is spectacular. Would be 5 stars if they had beer. I love hot food and this is hot, but without a nice cold beer to take the edge off, kind of ruined it. They used to have alcohol apparently as it is on the menu so not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Holy Kim chi chigae!

I think this has got to have the best soft tofu Kim chi soup. Definitely full of flavours! I love how there is tender pieces of beef in my soup and big pieces of Kim chi. The only thing I would complain about is I didn't like their choice of tofu, wish they went with a softer tofu. 

The seafood pancake is to die for! I just loved how crispy it is and oh my, can eat that all day with their ban chan. Ban chan are side dishes that usually comes with your meal and let me say this, every single one of them is extremely delicious and I couldn't be happier! 

The only thing I would be hesitant to order again is the spicy rice cake with fish cake. Don't get me wrong, the flavours were on point but for the price, they literally give you a few pieces of each...

I felt like it's a win for me because I loved everything I ordered but I did go with a party of 8 and I got to taste their food. The meats weren't amazing and one of the beef dish, I believe rib eye or something was so flavourless and tough. My boyfriend didn't really enjoy his spicy pork either. 

The service is weird. The lady serving us was nice and not nice at the same time. 

Would definitely return for some more of that yummy kim chi chigae!"}
{"text":"You know that old saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover?\" That definitely applies when it comes to Cafe Ga Hyang. 

My husband and I have been trying to find a decent Korean place in Phoenix for a while, and after less-than-stellar experiences at a couple of other places, we decided to try this place out, after reading about it in Phoenix Magazine. It was only about 15 minutes from our house; who knew? 

Upon arriving, we were a bit apprehensive; the restaurant is located next door to a tattoo parlor in a pretty sketchy, half-empty strip mall in Glendale. The decor is straight out of the 1970s, and the night we were there, the air conditioning was basically not working. But keeping in mind that \"don't judge a book...\" thing, we decided to stay. (We also took the fact that we were the only non-Koreans in the place as a good sign.)

I ordered the bibimbap with beef, which arrived in a sizzling hot bowl, as it should. Our server, who I am pretty sure was also the owner, asked if I had ever eaten Korean food. Before I could answer, she instructed me on the proper way to stir the ingredients in the bowl together. Almost immediately everything began to sizzle and the smell of cooking food wafted across the table! It tasted delicious, the perfect combination of spicy, savory and sweet, with a mixture of sticky and crunchy rice (the pieces that had cooked to the sides and bottom of the bowl.) If there is such a thing as Korean comfort food, this might be it!

My husband ordered the kimchi chigae, which is basically a stew made of  kimchi, pork and tofu. He was a bit disappointed that it wasn't spicier, and had more tofu than meat. I had a few bites and found it nice and savory - I will probably order it next time. The stew also arrived in a stone pot so hot it was still boiling, so while we waited for it to cool off, we helped ourselves to the Banchan, which consists of several small plates of side dishes that are served with every meal. Most of them are served cold or chilled, a nice counterpoint to the heat of our main dishes. I liked the pickled vegetables, the bean sprouts tossed with what tasted like a mixture of salt and vinegar, the pickled radishes, and the kimchi (again, more savory than spicy.) I did not really care for the steamed eggs.  Again, our server was kind enough to explain what everything was. 

All and all our experience at Cafe Ga Hyang was a pleasant one, and we will probably be back at some point. I especially think this would be a great place to come in the winter; a sizzling/steaming hot bowl of bibimbap or chigae would really hit the spot on a cold night!"}
{"text":"Easily best Korean food I've had in Arizona and pretty much anywhere. The interior is dark, cozy, and a little funky, and it's open until 2 a.m. most nights of the week. Everything I've had to eat there has been excellent, with the wonderful flavors and textures that make Korean cuisine so interesting. The same lady and guy seem to be always working there, so everything is consistent. This funky section of Phoenix has some of the best ethnic restaurants in the Valley, including this one and Siamese Kitchen a few doors down."}
{"text":"Came here late night when no one else was there eating and it was the great. The food came out quickly and hot. Everything tasted very good and authentic. Even the server lady was very nice and showed us how to eat the food and also brought us a whole pitcher of water because we were thirsty. Great drunk food and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  It's open late (but not on Mondays...watch it!) and it is good comfort food.  I always eat the Seafood Bibim Bap (Haemul Dolsot Bibim Bap) and it is excellent!  They bring you several sides of vegetable dishes, along with the main dish sizzling in a hot stone bowl.  If you like Korean food -- or want to try it -- this is the place to go.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles California, which I visited it  numerous restaurants in Korea town in L.A.. I was not expecting a great tastes like my town....it was very surprise!!! Even better than many of great restaurants in L.A.!!!! All side dishes r tastes great too!!!!! Owner knows how to cook with out MSG!!!! It's AWSOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Just average korean food. Kalbi was too dry & overall not worth the money. Kalbi Tang was also not the best. Ddok boki was just alright. The banchan was the best part of our meals. Waitress didn't want to serve us dessert so we left to get dessert else. Service was below average."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I've been coming here for years, a true \"hole in the wall\"! It's truly authentic Korean food! I'm Korean and I approve. The noodles are made in \"house\"! Everything is delish."}
{"text":"The best Korean Restaurant in Arizona. Coming from a place like Chicago, where Food is diverse and different, this place has everything you want. Open Late, Great customer service and definitely GREAT tasting food.  The Side dishes (Ban-Chan) are hand prepared and fresh tasting not frozen or stored like some of the other restaurants I've been too. Food comes out in a timely matter. There usually is only one server, one cook. During peak hours you may wait a little bit. But if you want to try good food its definitely worth the wait. This place is a Hidden gem Located in Glendale,AZ"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and food was good. I love Korean Bbq!!! The only thing that I didn't like was the bathroom near the kitchen area. Someone must have gone to the bathroom before I went and left a bad smell... so the smell of the restroom kind of ruined my experience. I know that it's not their fault but I just can't eat in a place that has a bad smelling bathroom near the kitchen area. A persons experience has to do with sight, sound, taste, and smell. This time the smell got to me."}
{"text":"The first time I walked in I was greeted by a cute door chime that said hello in Korean.  Inside it has the nice look of a Korean village.  Food is delicious, and I am always a fan of the side dishes.  Korean food tends to be on the more expensive side, but those little side dishes are great and the service was great here too.  If you are a white boy like me, they will automatically serve you regular water.  So, if you want a more authentic experience, ask for the barley tea that is customary for Koreans.  They will also explain how to eat Korean food, if you have never eaten bibim bap and start eating it as is!  :)  
The last time I was here service was great, but other times we had to go get the server.  Don't be shy, there isn't many people working here.
Don't mind the outside area, definitely come eat here!"}
{"text":"Decent not great Korean food. Chodang in the East Valley has better galbi. In LA, this would be a 2 star place and I probably wouldn't go again, but this is Arizona, and it satisfied my Korean tastebuds so we'll go again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"The atmosphere this place has gives me claustrophobia and it's very dark. It's fairly closed off and the place looks kind of run down. This place as you can see it's run bye a korean person and the service is just as I expected ( The korean culture is very nitpicking and very straight forward ) so the service does come out kid of rude, so i expected it. So please try to understand they are not trying to be rude to you, they just are. But it's the only place to eat  ( jjajang myun) or black bean noodles here in Arizona. The noodles aren't that bad and it's fairly somewhat better than some i have had in LA
I would give it four stars the food, 3 stars for the service ( Just to let you know even though i fully understand the culture, i just still think it's a BS way to treat costumers) btw i am korean 
2 stars for the interior 
So i have to say 3 stars but i will be coming back to update this review"}
{"text":"I normally go to Takamatsu for any of my Korean cravings. I decided I would try a new place and I was so glad I did. This has become one of my favorite after going only one time. The side dishes were so good. I got the Dok Boki and it was delicious and spicy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to try Korean food."}
{"text":"Man, I had called and placed an order for to go and the service was awful. I was hoping when I walked in, they would've been more friendly but unfortunately it didn't turn out that way. Now I just ordered the jjajangmyun noodles and they weren't bad at all. Not bad nor great. As I was trying to order side dishes, the lady I spoke to over the phone and in person was giving me attitude for trying to add the side dishes to my order even though I was willing to pay for the little dishes. This place sucked the life out of me definitely will not be back"}
{"text":"Cafe' Ga Hyang does not disappoint. Reading the reviews on Yelp helped us choose our menu and calibrate our expectations on the ambiance and service. Thank you Jay C. for your detailed review. Tucked in the corner of a strip mall, we appreciated the clean and simple signage. Cafe' Ga Hyang feels like an Asian Mom and Pop restaurant. I was transported back to my childhood. As a lover of KPop and Korean Drama (KD), I enjoyed the entertainment on the two screens.

It was a Saturday night. My hubby and I love going to ethnic restaurants on weekend nights because they are usually less crowded than typical American establishments. There were two other tables filled with families. The delicious smells of spicy bean paste, charred meats and pickled side dishes were intoxicating.

We sat down quickly and thanks to Yelp reviews, made quick decisions. We ordered the bulgogi, spicy pork, japchae and kimchi chigae. Because we anticipated a lengthier cook time, we brought a card game \"Exploding Kittens.\" We distracted ourselves with our family game, ignoring our rumbling stomachs. Then, the magical moment arrived, 10 banchan or traditional Korean side dishes that ranged from non-spicy, sour, sweet, salty, spicy, chewy, crunchy, soft, slimy. They prize diversity in heat, taste and texture. They brought bowls of perfectly steamed white rice. Our server initially brought three bowls of rice, we ordered 3 entrees. When the ahjumma saw my daughter in the corner, she quickly went back and brought a bowl of rice for her (Classy!). 

Why the long wait? Everything they bring out is piping hot. The grilled meats have an amazing char. The bulgogi and the spicy pork were perfectly cooked. I was curious to see that we did get more pork than beef. They were served in cast-iron hot plates. The bulgogi was tender and my family all agreed that they would like two orders the next time. My son said that he missed the grill table and me cooking for him. The spicy pork was tasty but too spicy for the rest of my family. The japchae was super generous, the flavors were alright. The Kimchi Chigae was the star for me. It was served bubbling hot. What a pretty dish! The straw mushrooms on top dressed the dish. The tofu was tender and nicely flavored. The consistency of the stew was just the right viscosity. The Kimchi and the vegetables were tender and distinctive, salty and spicy developed flavors. Sadly, because of the authentic heat level, my family could only enjoy it was rice. 

We ate heartily and had our favorite banchan. The ahjumma surprised us by asking if we wanted more of any of the side dishes, We requested more fish cake, mild cucumber pickle, and tofu with sesame oil. 

We will definitely be back. Next time, we might try the non-spicy Seafood Pa Jeon or appetizers as we build the heat tolerance among my family members."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was right at the beginning of the lunch hour and the second time was right at the peak of dinner rush.  The food and service was great both times.  The server greeted and seated us right away.  She was very helpful with the menu when I needed to make sure I was ordering the correct items.  The servings was huge in my opinion and came with plenty of side dishes.  We ordered the bulgogi, galbi tang, spicy pork bulgogi and the pork kimchi with tofu stir-fry.  Everything was delicious. My favorite is the pork kimchi with tofu stir-fry. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The place is kind of dated, but the food is very delicious and authentic. The service is very friendly but not over powering. Definitely would come again if we are in town."}
{"text":"Wanted Korean food, decided to try this place. Got the bulgogi, roommate got the soup with dumplings and rice cake. Friendly fast service and wonderful banchan. Love the cucumber, spinach, napa, but the radish (daikon) was my favorite! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll admit that I was a LITTLE bit worried about this place after we pulled into the somewhat sketchy looking parking lot. But knowing that sometimes the best places to eat are the sketchiest and that yelp usually leads me in the right direction, my parents and I ended up here on a recent trip to Arizona.

We had the ddukbogi as an appetizer which had just the right amount of flavor without being overwhelming, although I think the rice cakes were a bit too chewy. But that was absolutely forgiveable considering the rest of the delicious entrees and side dishes.

The star of the meal was the champong, which my dad is EXTREMELY picky about, but he agreed that it was one of the best he's ever had since leaving Korea. My mom ordered sul-lung-tang which was also excellent, and I had the bibimbab. I would totally come back here repeatedly if given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Been here thrice now but our service tonight has just been horrible. Our food took more than half an hour to come and the server seemed more engrossed in watching TV than even offering to refill our glasses. Don't come here in the evenings!!. They're just really stressed and will stress you out too."}
{"text":"our hostess was a wonderful person; helpful and her service was great! Loved my very first experience and looking forward to revisiting this establishment."}
{"text":"I took a huge detour to try their Sul Lung Tang, a beef broth Korean dish that's easy to find back home in LA. Along with the Korean drama that was playing on a huge flat screen, it kinda reminded me of my mom's cooking. If this place was any closer, I would be their number one customer."}
{"text":"So I was really hesitant giving this review because I've been here a couple times and the people who work here are relatively nice (well, sometimes. I guess it depends on the mood of the place and how crowded it is at the moment). BUT I MUST PROTECT THE PEOPLE. Anyway, this was my go to place for authentic Korean food (though I must admit that they are sometimes pretty stingy with their side dishes). I came here on Sunday, 3/12/17 and on my way to the bathroom, I see stacked up trays of RICE CAKES just sitting there. For anyone to touch. Or sneeze on. Next to the bathroom. Near cleaning supplies. I was pretty shocked. Why would they just put it there and not in the kitchen (where it would be more appropriate)? I don't know but after seeing this, I totally lost interest in ever coming here. Just made me feel as if they don't really make that much of an effort to serve clean food. I mean, if I were able to see this, I wonder what happens in the kitchen with the food they serve. 

Oh. And I totally ordered hot water and it tasted weird. And I think I know why...."}
{"text":"Lately I have had a bad hankering for some Korean food, but the valley sucks in numerous locations. This is my fourth Korean place and I was quite satisfied. I was about to head to another restaurant near ASU West because it was pretty good, but finally decided to try a different one. Gladly I did. 
I did not care about driving to the west valley from near the airport during rush hour because my craving was that bad. We finally get the the place and only one other table was there. We get seated and I had to get barley tea.
Browsing the menu I was pleased to see samgyupsal (pork belly) on the menu! We debated on an appetizer, mandu (gyoza) or ddukbokki. I've made the spicy rice cakes at home but never ordered at a restaurant yet, so we choose the latter. I wanted to see how HOT they really were. Bf ordered the usual bulgogi. 
We waited in anticipation for the food, and ddukbokki came first, large rice cakes and nice chewy texture. BOY! They were spicy, but sooo good. I enjoyed it as much as I could before I burned my mouth anymore. Then she brought out the banchan, nice large selection, some I have have yet to try until then. Also she brought the lettuce/onion salad with sesame oil dip and ssamjang. By this time I had to stop eating the spicy rice cakes and order a soda since the barley tea wasn't cutting it anymore.
Finally the meats were at our table and plentiful portions. I asked about lettuce wraps for the samgyupsal but she said I could eat it with without the wraps. Having not done so before, she actually helped me how to do so. I wasn't a fan of ssamjang before until she slapped it on my chopsticks and I was hooked. She also suggested that my bf try the bulgogi the same way, dipping in the sesame oil and with lettuce. 

I enjoyed the whole meal and was pleased with the quality and helpfulness of the waitress. I would go back and try other menu items without hesitation. When they say spicy, they mean spicy...my kind of people!"}
{"text":"If someone is reading this review listen very carefully. You have a tough decision you must make if you are on this side of town and craving Korean. Cafe gang ha? Or takamatsu? Both Korean. A city block apart. Only one can rule them all... Let's go!!!

Negatives
- service is can sometimes be subpar.
***message for the white people ( they're Korean, don't expect them to come over with a fake smile asking  \"how's everything tasting so far!?!? Every 5 minutes. No. This is not TGi Fridays)

- flavors are sometimes not as deep
- not as spicy as regular Korean. If you don't like spice could also be a positive.

I give both restaurants 5 stars because I love Korean good or bad! I go to both so take it from me! Takamatsu is the place you go to on a weekend if your with a companion and want to have a great night. Cafe ga hang is the one you go to during the week solo after work, just to enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Korean food and it wasn't a bad experience. I ordered a BBQ beef meal that came with a side of rice. It wasn't bad at all. The restaurant was clean and it actually took me by surprise ! The setup was awesome, you really have to check it out for yourself. The reason it's not a 5 star is because the food was a little pricey, my meal was $14 and it wasn't a big meal. But overall I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving korean food and our go to restaurant was closed for the holidays so we decided to eat at Cafe Ga Hyang due to the good reviews. Came in for a late lunch and ordered two hot stone bowls of beef bibimbap. It was good but not great. There were about five small pieces of beef and the serving wasn't big at all. Definitely not worth the $$$. The appetizers however were great. 

Service was good. Some of the reviews pointed out that service here was terrible. It seemed like there was only one or two people running the place so obviously, service isn't going to be amazing."}
{"text":"A true gem for PHX and the west valley area. The owner provides an intimate experience and isn't afraid to offer insight on the best way to partake of the dishes. All the food was absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait 30 min for your ja jiang mien. This is so ridiculous !! Their service is super slow here and they don't apologize for being slow too."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about this place due to previous reviews but I was really craving Korean food. The food did not disappoint. My wife and I lived everything they brought out. I could see how some one could say the service was slow due to there only being one server but we didn't experience this at all. The server was so friendly and welcoming. When the place did full up she still made time for us. When our food came out it was rather fast. We will be coming back again but next time will be splitting one of their great entrees."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years, but the signage is so unobtrusive that it was effectively camouflaged, hiding its treasures. But I wanted kimchi jjigae and bibimbap late at night and they were there when I needed them. The presentation of the banchan always feels very special, and although they are not incredibly unique in their assortment, you certainly feel royal when eating them. Lots of little pops of acid and spice tease you and create an effective appetizer.

The actual entrees I'd only describe as \"pretty good,\" but to be fair to the restaurant, I was there at like 11PM. They also didn't have any of the menu desserts or special drinks that we were looking for, but again: we were not really there at a reasonable hour, and they were gracious to have served us at all considering how late it was.

There's a pair of TVs blaring Korean television over satellite pretty much the entire time, which I actually enjoyed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Very friendly and open til midnight! Cash only. Affordable and big portions. Authentic."}
{"text":"OK, so I have searched high and low for decent jja jiang myun in Phoenix so I was really excited to try this new place.  I was kind of disappointed... it was super watery and slightly bland.  I actually prefer this to salty, but the watery broth made black sauce go everywhere while I was trying to eat it.  

I also got the dduk bok gi - a little heavy on the red pepper flakes but pretty tasty overall.  Those are jalapenos, not green pepper slivers btw.

We also tried the Tang Su Yuk which was delicious and pretty close to what I was looking for!

So ding ding ding - I want to try this place again before updating my review, but so far I think I like the Korean homestyle cooking this place offers!  I'm pretty sure their sullong tang will be much better so that's what I'll be getting next time.  :)"}
{"text":"cham pong was delicious! i was craving for a bowl of spicy hot noodle soup and it was satisfying!
noodles were a bit soft and mushy...but portion was huge and loaded with veges. onions, seafood.  i had 2 huge shrimp with the head and shell. flavor was yums.

service was a little slow, but i dont blame the korean ajumma for working solo.  i walked inside and no one was at site.  i had to walk near the kitchen and yelled \"hello\" before she came out."}
{"text":"You just found one of the best hidden little treasures on the ass-end of Yelp, my friend. 

I need you to get excited about this... I need you to be on this same Level as me. You need to raise the volume on this one. 

You may not know, but you gunna learn. You gon' learn today...

Recommendations: uh, EVERYTHING.

My comfort foods are: Kimchi jiigae, seafood Tofu soup, seafood pancake, fermented bean paste stew, & Soon Dae Gook (Korean blood sausage). 

That one made you smile, didn't it? Yesss, Yea-ha-haa! That's what I'm talking about, I love where your heads at.

If you see something on the menu you can't read, pronounce or recognize... order it, D'uh. Otherwise, why are you reading this, go get back in line at Pei Wei, Fresh Wasabi, or Panda Express.  Those flavorless, cultureless McDonaldized versions of food. 

Now, where we're we? Ah yes, fair Warning. Be prepared for the owner. She's a bit...well, should we say, she's like...This is her restaurant & she knows it. 

She used to work down the block at Takama-what-ever-that-places-name-is, but left to open Cafe' Ga Hyang. Aaand in our estimation, no better move for food has ever been made.

She's like...

Some times, you may not even notice her, like soft background music that doesn't remind me of cats in heat, or subliminally as the Korean advertising on the wall telling me to drink more: all smiles & encouragement. 

Other times, She she may remind you of a certain North Korean dictator. 

In my experience, after refilling my glass a single time, she's told me that I drink too much water. 

Another time, she took my order & then told me to order something else. She told me I won't like it. She said, and I'm paraphrasing here, that: this is not for you, Americans. You ( I think she meant white ) won't like this. 

No big deal, she doesn't know me, or my love for everything cultural & food. 

And after I insisted, she gave me that face; You know, the one homeless schizophrenics give you when you tell them you don't have any money. The face that says you're a liar and a stupid-head. 

And that's true, I am a stupid-head, but don't say it to my face! 

Look, listen, Follow me, don't get discouraged. 

what I'm tellin ya is this: yes, she can be a pain in the ass. No, you may not understand much of anything thats transpiring. Yes, interactions may lead to inferences about your Manhood/Womanhood, threats against your safety I'm sure we're made in haste, who knows, whatever, it's Whatever. 

Just remember, why you're here. You're here because once you step into the doorway, You crossed a thin spot in reality; an invisible meniscus that Jaunt'ed (Thank you Stephen King) you to Cafe' Ga Hyang--a small eatery, on the opposite side of the globe, somewhere in mainland South Korea. 

So breathe in the air. Don't hurry through this. Friendships in culture are built over long, delicious meals. You're gunna want to take your time here.  

You're here because, in your travels, your many steps, You've kindled a love for everything Culture & Food.

You'll find it here."}
{"text":"The restaurant gave me an old and filthy feeling once stepped inside, but the food is authentic and fairly good! Number one favorite is the Seafood Pancake, a must try. The Galbi (bbq beef short ribs) turned out to be beef meat cut out from whole stick of rib bone, NOT the traditional cross-cut rib, that the bone was still bleeding on the plate. For $22, this Galbi is too expensive. Ojingeo Bokkemn was tasty, but this time opting noodles on the side for extra $5 was a mistake because the noodles were overcooked too soft and tasteless. The Dolsot was good but too little rice that 1/3 of the rice stuck at the bottom and burned. Overall, most of the food taste good. Don't expect service though, only go for the food except for the Galbi."}
{"text":"I feel in love with Korean food!! This place has never disappointed on satisfying my taste buds. I have to admit at first I didn't like this type of food, but I gave it a second chance and now all I think about is Korean, Korean, Korean, I'm turning Korean! I really recommend this place. You have to try the duk boki and kalbi dolsot bibimbap they're out if this world!"}
{"text":"The place is a bit of a hole in the wall in strip mall but the food makes up for it. We ordered the chicken and short ribs BBQ and both were really delicious. It came with a lot of traditional pickled sides and individual rice bowls.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My favorite Korean Restaurant in Glendale area. Beat every Korean restaurant out here with their Banchans. Very authentic and home-like. The ajumma who serves there reminds me of my grandma. ;) Must visit. Sucks for no alcohol but that doesn't deduct a star point. Not the best if you are trying to compare with LA restaurants, but we are in Phoenix. Bare it. ;) I add, their dduck bok yi is the best yummmm..."}
{"text":"This place suck. Really dirty. Almost wanted to throw up. The wait time is so long. I decided to check it out due to decent reviews. I guess there are low standards here. Avoid"}
{"text":"I love this little mom and pop Korean place. My brother in law who is Korean, said it reminded him of home cooked style food. Which coincidentally the Chinese characters ?? that are part of their sign actually mean \"hometown\" in English. One of my favorite dishes there is their jajangmyeon, black bean noodles. You get a plentiful helping of noodles in black bean sauce with bits of pork. I normally have enough left over for another meal. I also really like their take on Sundae, blood sausage. Of course all of their bbq is good too."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Overpriced and they don't serve miso soup with meal. First and last time here. Had the kalbi ($21.95) small portion for price  and pork bulgogi which was just ok."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was excellent, staff very friendly. Great for authentic korean. The fermented soybean soup was awesome. I plan on becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food yet in Phoenix.  They have an awesome seafood pancake and their bulgogi is great.  I love the fact that you can order the small tiny fishes, these are almost never part of the variety of dishes, but they have them here.  Great place and not very expensive."}
{"text":"The female owner is awesome. We pulled in around 1am after a hard night of drinking and the owner took care of us.  I let her know that we are used to the really good Korean food in Los Angeles and she accepted the challenge. She made some great suggestions and the food was wonderful. The complimentary side dishes were great and we ate it up as fast as it hit the table. She even came over and cut up our meat and stirred our food for us so that we didn't burn ourselves. Overall, a GREAT late night spot that blows away it's competition."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch with my girlfriend. I ordered the seafood bibimbap and it was delicious. It was served inside the hot stone pot and i love how the rich burn at the bottom making it crispy. The seafood sauce was very flavorful. The side dishes kim chi was marinated well. 2nd time visiting this place and the owner lady was always nice and thoughtful. The price was reasonable for lunch meals. 
Will definitely come back to try their cold noodles one day."}
{"text":"Against all odds, this place is decent. Just expect slow service. 

This Korean restaurant is like pretty much every other - loud, quick, has Korean tv shows blasting 24/7, etc. You've probably been somewhere like this before, and that's fine. The only thing to note of any merit is the location is smaller than normal. 

The food here is good. While I have had better bibimbap and similar dishes, those available here are rather good and adequately spicey. No punches are pulled, which I greatly appreciate. The winner here was probably the soups available, but I may be biased due to the relatively colder weather. 

The service here deserves mention and half-complaint. There was one - that is, ONE- lady running the entire show here. Taking orders, refilling drinks, etc. While the place is small, this setup nonetheless still fails horribly: refills are a bit too slow, food is a bit too delayed, food sits on the counter a little too long, etc.  Thing is, despite her slightly impatient personality, this isn't the server's fault - no one could handle the volume at a place like this singlehandedly. It just doesn't make sense, and it makes the experience somewhat unpleasant. 

Long story short, the food here is good, but the service problem needs to be rectified immediately."}
{"text":"The food is great but the combination didn't include much entrees."}
{"text":"Best korean food! Best service!!
They don't use MSG.  food was great. What can I say~
I will come back this restaurant when I have a chance to visit Phoenix again.."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Korean restaurants and have never received great service, so I don't ever expect to get anything more than decent service at real Korean places. 
Having said that, the service here was okay, they checked on us more than normal, but the food! It was great!! Like going to Grandmas for dinner, and she (even though she isn't mine) came out to see if we were enjoying it and even mentioned that she doesn't use msg.  We had kalbi (which is my all time fav), bulgogi, teriyaki chicken, bimbimbap, ALL of the little side dishes and got their gyoza which I'm pretty sure was rounded yakimandu...and it was all really good and not over priced.

They do add a service charge for 5 people or more, and it is because there are plenty of people that go out and don't understand that Korean food isn't the quickest and neither is the service so they leave no tip...so it's only there because too many people have been too cheap. If you want to be like that then figure out how to make the food yourself and good luck with that."}
{"text":"Finally I got to try many's favorite Korean place in Phoenix. Their haemul pajeon (seafood pamcake) was absolutely amazing, and that sauce.. Yummm.  Apparently their most popular dish is ddukbokki and I saw every single table (usually non-Korean) get one. Theie banchans were a little disappointing, everything was on a sour side and lacked variety in terms of flavors. And they didn't have their alcohol while it was on the menu.. Wha?! But still a great place to give a go!"}
{"text":"After a year in Korea, the food was dang close to what I'm used to. There wasn't anything too off the wall, like I've experienced."}
{"text":"The REAL deal for Korean Cuisine !

This is only the second Korean Restaurant I've been too and the other one seemed like  normal everyday American Food compared to here .
The decor is a mix of Asia , Gilligan's Island , and a disco .

We started with the OH MY GOD if your looking for SPICY fish cakes with chili sauce and added assorted peppers appetizer dish . I wouldn't say #10 Thai hot but maybe almost a nine hot since the sauce had a nice sweetness to cut the heat . I am not 100% sure if we got what we ordered since neither of us recognized anything on our plate as fish but whatever it was it really did taste good . The what we think ( and hope ) were fish cakes looked like logs of gnocchi pasta but had an unusual texture that was chewy and light . I saw slices of what looked like beef through the platter but passed on trying since they were unknown to me but my husband ate them and said they were just beef . Our server was so HAPPY and enthusiastic we ordered this dish she actually JUMPED in the air for joy . I was afraid to ask if this was what we ordered since I also didn't want to know if it was something I would never eat .

I tried what was basically chicken on a sizzling skillet with vegetables in a sort of sriracha tasting sauce . This dish was good . We were given eight little dishes of pickled sides . I found it interesting that each side really did change the taste of the meal and the anchovies with peppers made the taste change to a Thai food taste and I liked that one the best until I saw heads on the tiny fish and had to stop with that one . My meal also came with a large bowl of fresh steamed sticky rice .

My husband had the beef rib soup . The soup came out SIZZLING really sizzling . The soup seemed like a beef stock with some sriracia added and in the middle of the soup was a big beef rib the soup also had crumbled tofu in it . The soup also came with a big bowl of rice .

 Portions were big for sharing ."}
{"text":"The food we ordered was very good. The service was good overall my daughter and I would go back."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in my last meal. I was happy to have found this place earlier this year but I will now just cook my food at home. 

I was the first person in the restaurant and placed my order. Family members of the waitress walked in and became priority. They received multiple banchan right away and had food served to them after they ordered while I sat around with just barley water. Initially when I had even asked for barley water the waitress acted like it was a hassle to even have to serve it and told me they didn't have any. 

My banchan came with my meal and there were three items. A couple came in next to me and ordered and asked for cabbage kimchi and was told they couldn't have any because it didn't go with the meal. Excuse me?! As a Korean, I have never seen ANYONE been told they can't have banchan. I told the couple that wasn't standard service that is usually received from that waitress in other occasions. I asked the waitress for more banchan and in a serious tone she told me she didn't have any more to give me.

I had planned on ordering food for my husband to take home and she put the check on my table while I was still in the middle of my meal.  Her priority became watching the soap opera on tv rather than service. 

Speaking of the meal, my jampong consisted mostly of peppers. Pure disappointment. 

I felt as though I received prejudiced service. I was speaking Korean and attempting to be polite, but all she saw in her eyes was a half white person who she didn't have time for. I called my mom enraged after the meal and she agreed that for some meals you don't necessarily serve certain banchan but if someone asks for it you should oblige. 

I will not enter this establishment again."}
{"text":"Cafe Ga Hyang is a little mom & pop restaurant that serves up Korean Chinese cuisine as well as Korean favorites.  The decor is that of a  traditional Korean farm house with wood post & bamboo wall linings. The cafe part is the diso & koroake lights on the ceiling, flat screen showing Korean news & that annoying little door bell that greets you in Korean.  There was only one waitress who was very attitude.   The OB beer came w/ ice cold glass (+1*) but the prices (especially seafood dishes) were a little more than what I'm used to.  Since it's still a Korean restaurant 4 banchan (side dishes) were served which was alright.  

Champong (3.5*) 
Cha Jang Myun (4*)

Cafe Ga Hyang is still better than a lot of the Korean joint in the valley so I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"It's funny because one of my friend said I'd rank my choices of school based on the surrounding food...and it's funny because Cafe' Ga Hyang's rating is exactly how I felt about the school I was interviewing with...just A-OK...not deserted like Erie, PA but not super crowded like DT Chicago

Everything on on point, the lady spoke korean, the korean television was broadcasting korean news, I ordered my usual to go korean spicy cold noodles (bibim naengmyun)...and it came out

voila....it even looks authentic...but one bite..OH WHAT THE F*&K....from almost a decade of korean dining experience...what did i just put into my mouth......

ok...time to pack up..get the bill, stomach down what i can and leave"}
{"text":"We just had our first experience here at Ga Hyang last night and it was great! The food, atmosphere, and late night hour that it was open until (2am), made this feel like an authentic Korean experience (having lived in South Korea for over 2 years, it's almost unthinkable to close a restaurant before 10pm:) My Korean wife was also impressed with this restaurant too. If you can impress her with Korean food in the USA, then you're doing pretty good! Also, our server was very attentive to us and came back to check on us frequently to make sure everything was ok. Don't believe me? Check out the New Times magazine's very favorable reveiw of Ga Hyang here. http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2012-05-03/restaurants/caf-ga-hyang-has-a-lotta-seoul/"}
{"text":"In \"the valley\" where there is a plethora of faux vietnamese and kitschy chinese food, a lone beacon of light shines upon cafe ga hyang.  I'm a californian, which means i'm both a foodie and a cultural snob.  Judge as you may, I am more than happy to hide behind the cloak of anonymity that is the internet.  So here goes the experience.

As soon as we entered the glass-shattered door, we were welcomed and seated promptly by what seemed to be the waitress/hostess/owner of said establishment.  She provided menus and asked us what we would like to drink.  Pretty standard, really.  

Upon brief inspection of the menu and realizing we are new to the restaurant, we tested the classic dishes of such an establishment: bulgoki and japhae.  After ordering, we were greeted with traditional banchan: kim chee, pickled cabbage, cucumber salad, pickled tofu skins, pickled radish, dehydrated fish, etc.  The banchan as well as the service was both timely and fantastic.  

The japchae and bulgoki were as expected.  The bulgoki was NOT ribeye or some prime cut of beef but passed as both tender and flavorful.  The japchae was not exceedingly oily but passed with flying colors.  The banchan really was the highlight of the lunch.  The variety and quantity really warranted a repeat visit.  

I'll end with a world to the locals.  As far as authentic korean cuisine goes, visit this place.  It is authentic as you can get outside of large korean communities.  It may not be the best, but it is likely the best in the area!

Keep in mind I've given this place a 5 star review only to offset the poorly rated reviews provided on yelp.  Compared the the establishments in Seoul, Korea or at the very least those at Incheon, this place pales n comparison.  But as far as Phoenix is concerned, this place is lightyears ahead of it's time."}
{"text":"Excellent side dishes. I come here every Friday night. Soondae soup is excellent. This restaurant open late till 2Am. It's good for me. Now gah yang is my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably the only good korean restaurant in the valley. 

Theyre kind of stingy about togo boxes and wont let you take too many side dishes home.

The lady talks to much but the food and the atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"The interior is very cool - all dark wood and bamboo and it is spotless! My husband and I both loved our dinners. I had the Dumpling  Soup and he had the Bibim Bab. The little, complimentary side dishes are yummy as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here."}
{"text":"Great little family owned restaurant.  We are so excited that we don't have to drive to Mesa for good Korean food!  The woman who helped (possibly the owner?) us was very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent and comparable in price to other Korean restaurants.  They also have great green tea ice cream. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty dumpy Korean place, dirty and sticky tables and like other commenters said, food isn't that great. I'm not surprised that others said this place was dirty as well. I'll just have to come to terms that I can't have Korean food when coming through Phoenix."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in major need of a cleanup.and needs to be updated ceiling falling out go to the bathrooms and find food just sitting next to it on the floor that's just what I can see I wonder what the kitchen looks like.(don't want to know)

Duk Boki great appetizer. 
Champong is HUGE!!

Cute little mom and pop shop, a little slow, but still good place. 
I was there mid week for dinner and it was packed!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Korea and was looking for something to even compare to the delicious food I had there. Looking for more than just Korean bbq, I was pleasantly surprised to find this place on Google. My first time in I ordered the jajangmyeon and nengmyeon. Absolutely delicious! The ddeokboki is great, as is the bibimbap, mandu, etc, etc. 

The only reason for docking the star is really only 2 halves of different gripes. The service can be a lil eh sometimes, so that's just 1/2 a dislike. But the menu has alcohol on it, and then they say they don't serve alcohol! 1/2 of a bummer. But the food is bomb and definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Like all fresh Korean food, it did take a bit to make, but the food itself tasted amazing. I haven't been able to find a place that tasted like the food I ate in Seoul, until I came to this place. I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say I have no idea what I ate, but it was filling and delicious. (Brief English descriptions and pictures available). It sort of looks like mud but I can guarantee it tastes much better. It was some sort of seafood bean sauce rice stone pot and the last item on the lunch specials. The boyfriend would give it a three for his dal bulgogi. It was good, but nothing to write home about and I would agree with his food rating. The sides were of varying delicious rating with our favorite being the tofu which we fought viciously for.  Korean expert said this location is good with quality meat and his favorite tofu soup. I'll take his word for it."}
{"text":"Was impressed with the food, the Beef Bulgogi has a smokey flavor which I've never experienced before but was very good.  Service was great, waitress had a smile and we enjoyed our Saturday afternoon meal.  The serving sizes were great and the amount of side dishes were plentiful and a great variety.  Traveled from Surprise, AZ and will make the trip again."}
{"text":"We go here a lot because of how late it is open and because I think it's better food than at OHYA up on Thunderbird. 

The low rating is because of service.. It's a hit or miss. They have only like two women working here and its one at a time. If you get the older lady you will get terrible service. 

Like us. Right now.. We have been sitting here for 30   minutes after she threw the menus at us without making eye contact to run to a bigger group of people. We put in our order but it's been over 30 minutes of nothing."}
{"text":"This is our first time here, we had bulgogi and it was the most authentic Korean bulgogi I've had. The customer service was also good. The only problem about this place is the A/C, so we moved one of the fans to where we were sitting. The overall experience of this place was good."}
{"text":"Super delicious! We stopped in one night, unaware of their extended hours. We were the only two in and thought they might be closing soon for the night. However as we wrapped up our meal others started pouring in and we saw that they quickly filed up at 10 at night! 

Definitely a hole in the wall spot but a good find none the less! We will be returning."}

I has the black bean paste noodles and they were the best i have ever had. Service was typical for a small cafe style. every time i go there is only like two other parties there.

{"text":"This was our first visit to Cafe Ga Hyang and enjoyed the everything we ordered, including spicy ddukboki, mulnengmun with Kalbi, and dolsot bibimbap.  The server warned us that ddukboki will be very spicy.... and it was....and we loved it.   

Kalbi was very flavorful. Steaming Dolsot bibimbap had several different vegetables that I liked and it was sooo delicious.   The burnt rice in the bottom was also yummy.   

Great food. Good service.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Omg the tofu soup here is so good  I think its the best one I had yet. Even the condiments were flavored well. I loved everything about this store except for the service.

{"text":"This mom and pop shop is a bit endearing. There is one waitress (presumably the owner) for the entire place so when there's more than 2 parties at the restaurant, service is bound to be slow. There were about 3 parties, including ourselves, at around 8pm and it took about an hour for our food to arrive. The Ban Chan she prepared for us sat at the front counter for about 25 minutes because she was so caught up with taking order and running around the place. We ultimately refilled our own teas and served ourselves in order to free her up some time. You can't blame her because it's a one man show, but at the same time it's a bit silly they haven't hired someone to help by now. 

The food is decent. It's certainly not four stars, and I'm not comparing this to Los Angeles. For those who have been to Honeypig in MD/VA, I think the meat there is better. 

Lackluster Dishes:
-Bugolgi 
-Pork Belly
-Japjae 
-Seafood Bibimbap 

Decent Dishes:
-Seafood Pancake
-Seafood soup (Sundubu jjigae)"}
{"text":"Café Ga Hyang was the placed picked for the 5th meet up for the International Supper Club UYE, and I have to say I am extremely thankful for all those who attend!! You guys are amazing!!! Thank you!!

Ok like I said Café Ga Hyang was the placed picked, and when I originally called to make reservations for the group, I requested 14, but by the time it was dinner, we had grown to 18!!! Had to have an extra table added to us! Café Ga Hyang was helpful in that and didn't really make a fuss about it!

This was my 1st time ever for Korean food, so I was very unsure of what to order, so after looking at the menu I decided to go with Bul Goki, which was sliced beef marinated in a soy sauce base of sorts on a bed of grilled onions, came with a side of steam rice too. In my head I was thinking oh this is like fajitas and I like fajitas. The dish came out piping hot! And I have to say, it was very good!

Our server, whom I figured was also owner, was kind of gruff, not so much with the amount of people, just with everything I guess, but sometimes she would come across mad and not listening to you, but then friendly and helpful. I just was not trying to rock the boat haha, the little side dishes came out and she placed them on the table but told us not to eat them, they are for when our food comes out, but some tested the gods and took some of the tofu before our food came out, we were making jokes saying the soup nazi will kick you out! 

Over all it was a great experience, I would go back and try different dishes, everything looked amazing! it was a great meet up  for the International Supper Club!"}
{"text":"We had 13 of us and it was nice they told us to come at 7:30pm on a Saturday so they can set up for us.  When we got there we still had to wait 15 mins.  It was cold outside!!!  We finally got in and noticed they only had 1 server for the whole place to do everything (ordering, busing, serving, etc.).  The service was slow but she is really nice.  The food took FOREVER!!!  I got gyoza, they were ok.  I got the dumpling with rice cake soup.  It was not that flavorful.  So bummed..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had never tried Korean food before, so we did a Yelp search and tried this one, based on the ratings. It is a small restaurant run by a couple of older Korean women. We had to wait awhile to be seated due to limited seating and service. Once we were seated, one of the women helped us pick what to order from the menu with her limited English. We ordered the bibimbap and bulgogi. We waited awhile again for the food. When the food finally came out, I was apparently eating my bibimbap wrong, and our server kindly helped me stir in the right things and showed me what to do. I appreciated it. The food was yummy and came with a ton of sides. It was fun to try and I would definitely go back again.

Pros:
-Yummy authentic food.

Cons:
-Slow service and limited seating.
-Location."}
{"text":"Lol, 2 am is tentative/subjective.We tried to walk in at 1240 and they turned us away.. There were lots of people inside so it's not as if they could close early either."}
{"text":"Cafe Ga Hyang is not only one of the best Korean restaurants in Phoenix, but one of the best eateries in the city period. Phoenix sadly lacks restaurants that are open past 10pm, and Cafe Ga Hyang fills that void, staying open until 2am. 

My husband and I went around midnight, the restaurant was quiet but not barren. I love the entire set up, with private canopied tables on one side of the restaurant. Sitting there felt very intimate and comfortable. I ordered the Kalbi Dolsot Bimbim Bop and my husband ordered the dumpling soup. Both dishes were fantastic! Lots of amazing spices and unctuous flavors. We both loved it! At the end of the meal, I wanted to get ice cream and ginger ice cream was recommenced. It was the most delicious ice cream I've had, possibly ever, and was the perfect way to end the meal.

Before we left, we chatted a bit with our waitress (owner?) who gave me a hug on the way out. Very sweet lady!

We will be coming back and recommending it to everybody!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Korean food. I thought the experience was great. I was initially a bit skeptical of trying it out. It I thought the Kimchi was delicious. I have a brother who lived in Korea and he commented on how authentic the food and the experience was."}
{"text":"Really awesome and renews my faith in food. Comfortable, very busy, actual Koreans eat here. A place to take you time. This is not a quick serve place and you have no reason to hurry. Please try the pickle condiments with your food. The seafood pancake is delicious but you definitely do NOT a side of rice with it.  My chicken BBQ served over raw onions may seem strange but eat bite if chicken was enhanced by it. You want to eat here. Just remember the owner lady is formidable so don't be an idiot. She is my hero."}
{"text":"Auntheic Korean at its best, ordered duk bok ki, kimchee chigae, galbi followed all the sides. Flavor was all there and the spiciness was perfect, service is great. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Seriously go to takamatsu only half a mile away. BEWARE! They are rude, foods only ok (I spent a year in korea) and they turned the lights off on us. Please I beg anyone here to do takamatsu or if your hankering for late night sushi do Ohya. 

Service was bad, I got bulgogi and it was bland and not flavorful at all. I also had the spicy fish cake, it came with only rice noodle and no fish cake! They never came around to refill our water, and turned the lights off."}
{"text":"Very nice Korean restaurant. The owner old lady is very nice. Their complementary side dishes are very good. The beef brisket is a bit too done and dry. It could have been better if it was a bit more raw and let it cook on the skillet. Their red bean ice cream is probably the best dessert I had in a long time."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone with Nick Rocha --- I wanted to call him and congratulate him on such a fantastic job with this business.... this cafe is amazing."}
{"text":"I was told by some of the review that the service was usually under-staff and not so good, however,I came very early today and I will say it was very friendly to us today.
The complimentary appetizer were various options and the staff refilled the favorite three for me.
We ordered the ribs Binbim Bap which was soooooo good, I think it was better than what we had somewhere else in town. The only con I will say is the rib meat was not in generous portion. 
We also ordered the bulgogi which was very flavorful, except the meat is bit of dry. 
We were quite curious about the Sundae, will try it next time for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Phoenix for just a day and wanted to eat Korean food (long story).  We found Cafe Ga Hyang online and took the 25 minute drive over there.  Walked in the door and the first thing the lady says to us is \"Cash only!\"  No greeting, no nothing.  She then said that the credit card machine was temporarily broken. 

BS.

We had read that others had had the same experience.  Apparently, this is routinely the way the greet certain guests, perhaps certain guests of a particular ethnicity.  Who knows, who cares; we didn't stay, drove back to the part of town we were staying in, and found a cute Italian place that was just great, and about which I shall now write a Yelp! review.  Stay tuned . . ."}
{"text":"We went with friends who frequent this restaurant and love it.  It was worth the drive from Downtown Phoenix.  I had the cold noodles bowl and my husband had the hot rice bowl (don't recall the names).  I have been enjoying leftovers for the last two days."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant!  I have never really had Korean food in a restaurant before.  When I was a kid a friend's mom would make me Korean food, but it's been 20 years.  Because I've never ordered Korean food, I became quickly aware that I had no idea what I was looking for.  I read through the menu and picked what I thought would be best for me.  When I ordered it, the waitress shared that this was not a good choice for a \"beginner\".  She suggested another type of Bip Bim Bap- which was exceptional!  Our group also ordered gyoza and another appetizer (can't remember what...) the gyoza was amazing!

The restaurant does not currently have a liquor license, so their menu is incorrect, but the staff will tell you this right away."}
{"text":"Came at 1 am , STARVING. 
They close at 2 am; clearly the signs says it as well. 
There must not have been any customers tonight because as we were pulling up and entering, they turned off the open sign and saw their feet shuffling away. I scoffed in dismay, they looked like they were hiding from the cops lol.

The door was open so we peeked our heads in and asked if they were open. They were pissed and the cook forcefully  waved his hand in ANNOYANCE.

The girl asked us \"how many\" ... If it'll be worth it for them to stay and serve us.

Horrible treatment to their customers. This is not the first time we've received attitude from them for eating late. Will not be back, no grilling anyways."}
{"text":"I was initially hopeful about this Korean restaurant given the number of positive reviews, but several dining experiences have given me a perspective on a number of issues that could be challenging to Korean cuisine enthusiasts. Located in a strip mall, parking was plentiful on each visit, but the interior also undesirably smelled like the dry cleaner next door. Interested diners can expect a dim lit, antiquated, and vertically arranged interior. The decor consisted a large TV, casual atmosphere, and a number of booths and tables on either side of the wall. 

The Bulgoki ($14.95) came with marinated beef that sizzled on a bed of onions. The marinade was decent but not spectacular. The beef came in too small pieces, and most tasted grainy and weak in texture. Portions were good, but the price was also too high for the quality. 

The Daeji Bulgogi ($13.95) came with marinated spicy pork, onions, and green onions. The seasoning was again decent, as I had much better elsewhere. It lacked the big juicy spicy pieces of pork that I was expecting. Not worth the price either. 

The Kabli Tang ($11.95) came with beef rib soup. The soup had decent depth, with large bulky beef ribs embedded. The soup could use some turnip to add on a sweet dimension. 

The Yang Ji Tang ($11.95) came with hot and spicy beef tripe soup. The broth was thick and milky, but lacked the deep bone marrow flavor. There were plenty of tripe, but most were also overcooked. 

The Kalbi Dol Sot Bibimbap ($11.95) came with rib meat, an assortment of veggies, egg, and hot stone bowl. The pieces of beef rib were delicious, but the rice weren't completely charred at the bottom. It was again a decent fare, given the few alternatives in the area. Interested diners should withhold their expectations, and expect some very basic flavors that were on point, but also mediocre when compared to their counterparts in other parts of the country. 

In short, Arizona deserves far better. We were provided about eight banchan items on each visit. They usually withhold these dishes until the food was served, and larger groups were consistently given more banchan items than the smaller tables. Once I saw the ahjumma visibly arguing with a couple and refusing to refill their banchan, which I thought was unusually petty when compared to other Korean restaurants, and counterintuitive to developing a loyal customer base. Another time Santi and I invited an out-of-town friend to dine here, and were completely embarrassed when she received an unsolicited lecture from the Ahjumma on how to eat Korean food. Consistent with these observations, our service each time was either slow, abrupt, or completely absent. 

Seongbukdong remains the standard for home-style Korean cuisine for me. Given the lack of alternatives in the area, all those looking for a relatively better fare should try Gogi instead."}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy my craving for a \"home cooked\" Asian meal when I'm too lazy to cook. The people who work here are always so nice and helpful when I'm eating the food incorrectly (they will just jump in and mix up your food if they see you haven't and you're struggling), which is very endearing. This is a small place in an otherwise \"sketchy\" looking plaza and is located next to a tattoo parlor and a carniceria. It's pretty hard to spot if you've never been here, so keep your eyes peeled!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!. It was great food and amazing service. I wanted a place to eat late at night and I found this little gem and decides to go with my sister as we are both Korean food fanatics. It can't get any better than this. I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for some Korean food. The restaurant is so cute inside, and offers some privacy in between tables. The couple of times I visited, it was pretty quiet, with only a couple tables. 
I had the bulgogi, and it is the best bulgogi I've had in Arizona. Hands down. Awesome flavors, and great portion size as well!!
I had the spicy rice cakes as well, and it was delicious as well! So good that I wish they had more. My boyfriend normally doesn't eat the spicy rice cakes, but he ate half of the dish here. 
He got the kim chi chigae, and he liked it a lot. I found it to be a little too sour for my taste. 
Overall, we felt that visited a Korean home and had some authentic Korean food. Our server was very nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place, it definitely fits the description of a hole in the wall restaurant. They don't have the best decoration or ambiance. There is Korean TV running in the background (luckily with subtitles). The A/C seemed like it wasn't working full power, they had multiple fans around the room and it was still pretty warm. 

Our waitress was a very nice lady. She didn't talk much but had a very nice smile on her face and she was quick and left a pitcher of water on the table. I think prices are a little high for the location and that is the only thing that maybe I wouldn't expect from a whole in the wall place. What do I expect? Cheap and delicious food. And the food definitely makes it worth it. 

We ordered the Bulgogi and a glass-noodle-with-beef dish. They both tasted fresh and flavorful. Portions were generous and I even had left overs for my next days lunch. The Korean sides were definitely some of the best I have had so far."}
{"text":"I finally located good Korean in Arizona! We had bulgogi, gyoza, chicken teriyaki and spicy octopus. Everything was delicious. The kimchi and potatoes were amazing. We plan on returning."}
{"text":"I haven't had Bibimbap in over 3 years... and I decided to try out Cafe' Ga Hyang, and of course ordered Bibimbap.  The very first touch upon my tongue instantly burst open my appetite so large that I was willing to kill the last unicorn on earth to get another bite.  The flavor was perfect, the vegetables fresh, and the meat was charred to perfection.  This place is amazing, and the tofu soup was bubbling hot and tasted better than a kiss from a beautiful girl.  I will definitely return to Cafe' Ga Hyang."}
{"text":"This is authentic Korean food.  It's delicious and the prices are right.  You want Korean food, this is the place to go.  Most of the food is spicy."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very traditional and service is fast. They give a lot of side dishes which is always a sign of a great Korean restaurant. I've been there about five times and have never been disappointed. Prices are pretty decent too. Highly recommend the kimchi chigae."}
{"text":"Food was not bad. Service was lacking. Although liquor was on the menu, they had none-with no explanation.  If this is Phoenix better Korean restaurants, good thing I'm only here over night."}
{"text":"We were on a road trip to San Diego and my lil son was eager to eat Korean food. Personally I do not go to Korean restaurant because they are quite expensive and not that tasty- I prefer homemade Korean food. When we visit there, the first impression was not good enough but the food! it was soooo good. All the side dishes were precious. I mean those are not something you can have even in Seoul. The lady proudly mentioned that most of veggies are grown in her garden. very fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Been there a couple times and the older lady has been rude every time but we would still go because the food was good and it's open late so it's convenient to us. I noticed she was only nice to the regulars and really rude to everyone else. The tv is really loud in there and there is never has music which is annoying. I rather listen to Korean music than talking. The whole atmosphere isn't the greatest. We have been there 4 times and yesterday will be the last. When we got there we asked for water and she came back to asked what we wanted and we asked for two sodas and she got upset and said \"you already have water\". we said we wanted both and she walked away. I was confused on why she got mad that we asked for sodas...We are paying for it. She didn't even let us order the food. When she came back with or sodas I told her what I wanted and my boyfriend wasn't going to get anything and she gave us a dirty look like why did you guys even come. Very uncomfortable. Then when she brought me my food she just tossed/threw it on the table rushed.  The food never would get me sick till last night and I'm sure it was because of her bad energy when she did that. Then at the end I was kind enough to put the plates and everything nice and stocked up on the corner of the table to make her job easier and when brought us the check she just left a wet rag on the table like we weren't there instead of waiting until we left. Extremely rude! I can't say this enough! I told my boyfriend not to even tip her and she heard me then she was being semi nice all of a sudden...he did tip her cause he's nice but personally I wouldn't. Like I said never going back again! I never write reviews and it's sad that this is my first one and it's negative but I rather people know so that they won't have a negative night instead."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely superb. I've had quite a bit of Korean food and this place trumps it all. Most importantly, the food is very fresh and authentic. I ordered the Bi Bim Bop and was not disappointed one bit. While the interior is a little dusty and the service is a little slow, the food is totally worth it! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking excellent Korean!"}
{"text":"They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!! 
The dishes I had so far:
Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Korean food, quick service, prices  reasonable, clean restroom, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok food, but when an adult German cockroach (Blatella germanica) struts up and walks over your napkin on the table, right next to your plate, you know the restaurant has a serious infestation."}
{"text":"Killer food! Every time I go. Best Korean restaurant in the Phoenix area. My father lived in S. Korea for 20 years and he told me that this was the best out of 3 or 4 others that we tried together. Super authentic!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant in the Glendale area.  When I have cravings for soft tofu soup and good variety of small side dishes, this is the place I would go!  Ingredients taste fresh and kimchi is marinated very well. Very friendly service and takes all major credit cards!"}
{"text":"I am figuring out slowly that Korean restaurants are far and few between here in Phoenix.  Considering the slim pickings here, I'd say this is pretty good.  Not Korea Town good but not bad.  I had the duk mahn du guk which is the Korean Dumpling Soup with rice cake.  Good and simple.  BF had the Kalbi and he loved every bit of it right down to the sucking the meat off the bones.  
Decent variety of ban chan but other reviewers are right - they don't refill.  Wha?!  That is a first for me!  I had to do a little persuading for the waitress to refill one of the dishes.  So when you do ask for a refill, choose wisely.  If the waitress didn't refill, I would have given it 3 stars just for that reason.
Will be back again though to try all the other dishes.  The fact that they have Soon dae guk (pork intestine/blood sausage) is a reason for me to think it's pretty authentic and legit.  I don't see that often and was surprised to see it here.  WIll have to see how good it is next time.
But beware, we went in and the bf tried to order a beer and she covered up the alcohol section and said they were out.  Korean restaurant...that is open until 2 a.m....that doesn't have alcohol...HUH??!! Is that possible??!!"}
{"text":"Came here for late food and to study. Servers sat at a table and talked about me/laughed at me till I left. That's it"}
{"text":"love this place.
don't expect great service, since they only have 1 person doing most of the things. taking order, clean the table, bring food to the table, fill the water and casher.
but so far, their food has been consistently good. I have tried a bunch of their dishes, so far. quite satisfying (for phoenix area).
still can't compare to what I had in the bay area. (snob...) but it is useful as a guidance standard. come here and can't go wrong with the korean food."}
{"text":"worst service ever, the older lady was so rude, she could not let me take more than 2 to go box to pack my food, and the boxes were so tiny.Also the other lady, I gave her $46 including the tips, she ended up saying that I only gave her $41, the bill was $39. Was so upset about their service. Another time, my friend and I went there for late night meal, we asked for more napkins, the older lady told not to use TOO MUCH! That's not how you talk to your costumers. NOT coming back again."}
{"text":"Friendly talkative, attentive staff. Best Korean food I have ever had. Planning a trip to Korea next fall and this food is as authentic as it gets in America!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Me and my group went there and ordered a bunch of stuff to try. Everything was delicious. The people I was with were eating Korean for the first time and they were pleased. That's all I wanted and I'm so glad that this place was able to do that for me. (also, it's pretty authentic because Korean people were in there enjoying the food as well.)"}
{"text":"Deserving a solid 4 for the food which trumps any other consideration on Yelp, I deducted a point for slow service on a Sunday afternoon while waiting to fly out of Phoenix. As a Korean American, I can smell out good dishes at most Korean restaurants. The jjajjang myeon -Chinese brown sauce noodles -were the feature dish though you wouldn't know it except for the Korean-Chinese description of the restaurant. The Chinese have lived in Korea as a minority community since at least Ming times as refugees from the Mongols. The Chinese food in Korea -aka Korean-Chinese food is a slight variation of Northern Chinese cuisine which is based on wheat and noodles over rice. Jjajjang myeon is a close sibling to Peking sauce noodles and this version was excellent with noodles made fresh on premises and cooked perfectly al dente. The tang soo yuk -a kind of sweet/sour dish with batter fried pork or beef was different from the usual presentation as it used fresh fruit -lemon and berries -to enhance the acidity. The meat was a little tough but overall great. I had the naeng myeon is a cold noodle dish with chewy capellini grade buckwheat noodles and a cold beef broth that is vinegared and garnished with sliced radish and beef was excellent. The kalbi was presented with a 3 inch section of beef rib with the tender meat cut into bite sized chunks was savory and very soft but a little too sweet -most people (non Koreans) will LOVE this dish. The ban ch'an -the side dishes were average but clean and fresh. 


Don't go here for atmosphere -they have several flat screens running K-drama and the evening Korean news cast. The food was slow -the chief had to make a fresh batch of noodles apparently but all the main dishes were perfect. 

I wish we had more of these in Cleveland."}
{"text":"In addition to the waitress handing us the more expensive dinner menu every single time we arrive during lunch hours and giving us the comment that not everything is on the lunch menu, they still have soju and beer on menu, but aren't serving. We were told that they used to serve these... Ok, so did they lose their license? Big thing for a Korean restaurant to NOT have Soju..."}
{"text":"Went while on travel for work. I got the spicy rice cakes, tofu soup and hot tea. Service was good but tofu soup was kind of bland."}
{"text":"Wow, what a yummy dinner! For the Yelp ISC UYE this month our fearless leaders Ursula and Monica selected Café Ga Hyang and what a great choice it was. I decided to be brave and order the octopus with noodles however our waitress (who I deducted from her brazen attitude is also the proprietor) talked me into the squid instead (sans noodles). The squid turned out to be a great choice since it was delicious! It was pretty spicy but not so much that it made your mouth hurt. Just some good heat and fantastic flavor. My hubby and mom accompanied me and to my surprise they both enjoyed their meals from the bbq section of the menu. Hubby got the spare ribs and Mom got the shrimp. Those two plates were not spicy but had really good flavor as well. In addition we all got white rice and all the usual Banchan (side dishes) including Kimchi. I did not sample all of them since it was just a ton of food but my favorite was the tofu dish.

The three of us agreed that the best thing we ate that night was the appetizer I ordered. Unfortunately I forgot the name but it was basically a plate of small, round, shrimp dumplings. The description in the menu said they were fried but they weren't super greasy or breaded or anything so I think they mean pan fried and not deep fried. They had the sweetest tasting shrimp in them and the wrapper just tasted like butter. They just melted in your mouth. The sauce that accompanied them was also delicious and unlike anything I had ever had before. It was red with a color and texture almost like tomato sauce. It tasted like it had some chili in it but it was sweet and also had some garlic and other savory flavors in there. It was so delectable that my mom wanted to keep it to put it on her bowl of rice that came with her entrée but our server informed us that was not the right way to eat it.  Too bad, because that sauce was fantastic!

Café Ga Hyang has really made me a fan of Korean food and if it was closer to where I lived I definitely would be back. A huge thank you to this restaurant for being so accommodating for our large group and making it a fabulous experience!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once when it was very busy (Wednesday at 6:00 PM) and I got their last available table and again (Thursday at 5:00 PM) when we were the only ones in the restaurant other than the staff.  The first visit I dined alone and due to the crowd it took 5 minutes to get my menu and another 15 minutes to place my order and then 15 minutes to get my food.  I thought this was reasonable due to the fact that there was only one server but I also believed they were understaffed. While waiting I decided the decor appeared worn but clean and the TV was a bit of an annoyance.  I would have preferred traditional Korean background music and the pictures on the wall of the food and their descriptions may be of interest to others but not my cup of tea, to use an overburdened metaphor.  Speaking of tea I ordered a pot of tea and received a piping hot green tea that tasted like swamp-water.  For me this is a good thing.  I ordered the Duk Boki for my appetizer and it was a nice portion with finger size solid noodles in a bed of spicy chili sauce with what I believe were mustard greens.  It was very satisfying and had a nice sweat inducing burn.  My entrée was their Bul Goki and it was the best I ever had with a light sweet soy on the front and a smoky finish.  The beef was tender, moist and high quality served over grilled onions and a side bowl of rice.  It also came with seven side bowls of Banchan many I never had before and all of them were delicious.  I returned the following night with my son and we were seated immediately and given our menus with our order placed quickly.  Our food arrived almost immediately and we split an order of shrimp dumplings that were also the best ever.  Eight of them came with a side of soy seasoned with a heavy dose of garlic, ginger and other ingredients I cannot identify but enjoyed very much.  They were also grilled which I liked and larger than others I've had elsewhere.  This time my entrée was the Kalbi which are their Korean barbecued Short Ribs and again the smokiness and seasonings were delicious.  My son had the Bul Goki at my recommendation and he also enjoyed it very much.  We received about nine bowls of Banchan with a couple different variations from the other night.  It was difficult to determine which I preferred they were all so good.  To summarize I would give Cafe' Ga Hyang 5 stars for their food, 4 stars for the service and 3 stars for the facility and price.  I will definitely return for more of their epicurean delights.  NOTE: Cafe' Ga Hyang no longer serves any alcohol."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I guess I shouldn't have expected the same type of food. My friends and I visited this restaurant for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and we were all craving Korean food. 

We sat down, and the waitress was really friendly, especially after finding out we were also Korean. She hooked it up with lots of side dishes (banchan). 

Food was good overall, but I was unable to eat the neng myun. I'm not sure what type of broth was used, but it was really disappointing. Nothing could be added to mask the taste of the broth. My sister and I eventually scooped some noodles out of the broth into a separate bowl, and we added some sauce from our sweet/sour shrimp dish, which tasted pretty ok. 

Warning: Their food is pretty spicy, even for the average Korean!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Very good, cute little clean hole in the wall. The waitress was very nice and went over what was what and how you eat it."}
{"text":"WoW!  Located in the weirdest strip mall on the west side of town, is this piece of asian food heaven.   There's a Japanese restaurant, Cafe Ga Hyang, tattoo parlor, Siamese Kitchen then what looks like a heavy metal/rock bar..so strange but great at the same time!  Gotta love it!

They have an array of Chinese and Korean dishes which range from $5 for appetizers to $16.95 for one of their Korean dishes.  I had Kalbi dish, and it was delicious!  And I didn't share, because it was so good! 

It's a small restaurant, however, friendly staff and just great food to enjoy with friends and family!"}
{"text":"I ordered Dolsot Bibimbap and Samgyupsal. It was tasty, well proportioned and reasonably priced, considering the quantity of food. The atmosphere was cool and the service and service people were very swift and kind. 

I've been to many Korean restaurants in Arizona, California and Korea. This place is pretty good overall and I recommend it. Even if it might be out of your way, I'd still go there and devour food. This place is worth a try even just once. 

Oh, and there's more Banchan than any Korean restaurant I've been to in Arizona. Solid restaurant and I'd go back, even though it takes over half an hour."}
{"text":"One thing I really miss about Southern California is the vast selection of Asian restaurants. It's pretty slim pickings out here in Glendale unfortunately. When I found Cafe Ga Hyang in the Phoenix, I seriously jumped for joy. Stopped in with my family this past weekend and basically had a huge feast. We ordered:

-Ddeokboki appetizer: rice cakes cooked and tossed in a spicy sauce. There is even some veggies and fish cake thrown in. SO GOOD and A MUST ORDER. 
-Jjamppong (or Cham Pong as it's written in the menu): spicy seafood noodle soup. It's pretty large so either order with a group of friends or when you are EXTREMELY hungry. Delicious! My mom was raving about it.
-Dolsat Kalbi Bibimpap: Rice mixed with veggies and beef. Sounds very plain but it seriously delicious. It comes with sauces on the side so you can personalize it a bit. This was my sister's favorite.
-Naengmyun = Cold Noodles. I can't really describe this dish too well. It's buckwheat noodles served in a bowl of ice water, rock sugar and pickled veggies. Sounds funny I know, but it is actually really good. I enjoyed this dish as it was a nice palate cleanser for all the spice I was eating.

For a Korean restaurant, the service was actually pretty good. It seemed like there was only one waitress working the entire restaurant but she checked on us often and was nice. My only quip was that overall the restaurant could have been a bit cleaner as my table was somewhat sticky when I arrived hah, but the delicious food made up for it for the most part. I shall be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean food I've had in Arizona and given that we have a decent sized Asian population, stores and restaurants here that's a big compliment! I had the Kalbi Bibimbap and the Jap Chae noodles. This is what I always order in every Korean reastaurant so I have a lot to compare it to. Both were very fresh with excellent flavor. Service was great, very friendly and helpful wait staff. The garnishes were fresh and very tasty as well. Damn I love those little potatoe cubes. If you've never had Korean food they had photos on the wall of the most popular menu items.  My only complaint is that it's a bit expensive but that's not a bad mark against this particular restaurant because I feel like all Korean restaurants are about the same price, $10-$12 for an entree with very little meat.  However, I still loved it and although I wished I had a little more protein it was still a value in that it was well prepared and tasted great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a Korean restaurant one other time where we got to sit on pillows on the floor.  This was in a different city, in a different state, in a different time, in a different point of my life....My experience at Cafe Ga Hyang was not as good as that time, but I'll give it three stars for the food.

I was anticipating the banchan because I like little bowls of numerous treats on the table, but most of the items were too tangy for my palate.  

Also, I made the mistake of not grabbing my bowl of food right way.  The woman serving our table mixed it \"for me\" and added sauce while saying, \"This is how you eat it.\"

I kept calm and carried on, but I was seething inside.  I don't like my food mixed with rice - ever!  And how could she possibly know whether or not I wanted any sauce!!  I didn't touch a bite so the other folks at the table ate it up and said it was good.

The other platter which I ordered (something fish-y) was good as were the spring rolls too.  Someone else ordered a salmon plate and that was okay.  If it weren't for the tasty garnish, it would not have impressed me."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, fast! First time and everything was so good. It's kind of hidden and small but prices are fair."}
{"text":"Met friends here for lunch.  the only thing on the menu which looked familiar was chicken terriyaki.
YUK.  Never again.  They used dark meat which was fatty and grissly.  Those are parts of the chicken I throw away. Not even fit for my cat.
I will stick to Tokyo Express for my chicken terriyaki from now on."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who is keen on looking out for my best interests brought up an interesting idea. 

\"Why don't you delete your old reviews and start fresh for the new year and do the same next year\"

It does make sense. Is a review from 2009 really relevant in 2012? Probably not. But I do like the idea and will take this into serious consideration and wipe my entire review data base from the cyber world and start fresh. But this is a rather daunting task and it will have to wait till after the weekend.

Fish head stew, an off the menu item here is one of those that I tried towards the end of 2011. I consider myself an adventurous eater, but the thought of fish heads in my belly would require serious amounts of sojou in my system. 

I was not that confident when the Concierge suggested we check out Ga Hyang and we would be amazed and \"blown away\" by this place. I must admit, there is better Korean in LA, but being this is the desert it really isn't bad. Effort is put into putting together quality dishes, but one piece of advice. You can tone down on the spice and just let the pork belly speak for itself."}
{"text":"A pretty good good Korean Bunshik Jib (Everything Restaurants)
Banchan is 7-8 dishes, food is above average and the atmosphere is pretty spot on~

A caveat is that it is a tad pricey especially when compared to   and other restaurants like this in LA. 

The two ladies that helped me on my visits don't shy away from suggestions and are pretty helpful!"}
{"text":"Ultra cool peeps, great service. Nice and quant decor and atmosphere. Nice ma and pa Asian restaurant !"}
{"text":"Like another Yelper has mentioned-hey, I'm from California too and Korean food is something I seriously love. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to say Cafe Ga Hyang isn't authentic but it's just A-OK. Then again my sweet, sassy Ahjummas who run the cafe you are probably the best Korean spot in this town, so... nolja~!

Ate here with my family and noticed the slow service, this seems to be an apparent trend amongst Korean restaurants where the owners are a pair of women running the entire place on their own. We finally got to order after being served waters, banchan and ordered the: Jajangmyeon, Kalbi Dolsot Bibimbap and Bulgogi. The food took a while, but came out in huge portions. 

Banchan- tasted alright, though my favorites were the cucumber kimchi, fishcake and shredded daikon kimchi. Everything else was a bit too sweet or lacked in flavor.

Jajangmyeon- noodles not as chewy, sauce was good with pieces of carrot, potato, onion and beef, garnished with cucumber slices and had a portion enough to feed 3 people. Was told this dish takes long because they make their own noodles, but wish they were a bit more chewy.

Bulgogi- good flavor, but seems to be marinated for too long as the meat's texture started to feel grainy and overly tender. perhaps if there was a more meaty chew to it, it would be good.

The service here does lack, but it is understaffed. Saw a lot of parties leave, after being left to wait for one of the women to take their oder. Food is okay in terms of taste, price on the menu does not reflect actual price on the bill and is a bit expensive. For 3 orders, our bill was about $50 which seems a bit excessive. The only good thing I would say is that they are open late and is one of the few Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. We had to wait 15 minutes just to get water. And then another 30 for our meal!

Food was pretty good. Bulgogi was on point - very flavorful. If I were to come back, I would have that they would up the ante in terms of speed and staff."}
{"text":"Right off the bat the waitress was very rude. Knowingly that we were Asians, she asked \"cash only, ok?\" We automatically assumed it was because of the broken credit card machine. Nope, not the case. People paid with credit cards whilst we were eating. That's just straight up bullshit. Another group of Americans came in and not once did she mention cash only. Every business has to pay taxes and it is illegal to avoid it. Now on to the food, we ordered spicy rice cakes for appetizer. It was bomb! I ordered spicy tofu soup with white rice and the soup was very bland. I wouldn't order again. My sisters ordered the bibimbap and they said it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Real Korean food! Finally. I have had a craving all week and just as I am heading to the airport, I checked Yelp on last time and boom! Just around a mile from where I was staying, I find this little gem.  Small nicely decorated dining area but a little hard to find.  Don't let the outside fool you.  The inside is really nice.    

Tucked into the northwest corner strip mall at 43rd and Olive; there appears to be a small collection of little south Asian restaurants.  The store front windows are covered in newspaper or some kind of board in the windows, to defuse the direct assault of the afternoon sun.  I was surprised to find this happy little Korean cafe for lunch stop on my way to the airport.  109 degrees outside, nice dark and cool inside. 

The prices were normal for Korean BBQ and the menu had everything I craved. It was hard not to try the Seafood pancake, spicy rice cakes and an entree. I wanted to make it quick and kept myself from ordering more than one item.  I am sure the others on the plane would not have appreciated the smell from leftover seafood pancake. 

I ordered Duk Mando Guk - Dumpling and rice cake soup.  Huge bowl of tasty rice cakes and dumplings in a light broth with dropped egg, green onion and pieces of carrot. 

This restaurant is not a steakhouse or BBQ grill house - the difference is rice cake.  The Korean restaurant that wants to be considered more upscale will not have rice cake in any dish on their menu.  It is considered street food (like french fires) and not worthy.  

I love rice cakes.  Spicy rice cakes, rice cake soup, hot pots with rice cakes -  Service was good. Not too crowded. The soup was perfect, as well as, the banchan that can with it.  I was in and out in 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Very good selection of side dishes. Sweet and sour pork, teriyaki salmon, and kalbi dolsot bibimbap were spot on. Waiters were attentive and atmosphere very Korean... Just a bit pricey, esp 11.99 for the bibimbap and 13 for the salmon. The sweet and sour was also 13 or so but that plate was huge and could feed two. Unfortunately the sweet and sour dish doesn't come with rice so its another 1.50 for a small bowl. What was unique about the sweet and sour dish was that it also had cooked strawberries in it!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is literally thee best Korean joint I have found in Phoenix. When you walk in it's like you're in Korea! The lady was kind to us & taught us how to eat the food the right way. She even served us, as in put food into our mouth (it wasn't that weird lol) 
If you like authentic, this is the place! 
4 stars because the food was da bomb!!
& because I killed a roach in the bathroom! it was a small baby one, & in the bathroom (who's never seen a roach in a bathroom right?). 


It's our little hole in the wall gem!"}
{"text":"Nummy num num

One of the best Korean restaurants in the Valley.  In a somewhat seedy area, but you're in for a treat once you make it past the tattoo parlor and the rough looking guy staring folks down outside.

They serve kimchee sides with meals as you find in real Korean eateries-- all very good.  Kalbi and bulgogi dishes are tasty and flavorful.  Service is very pleasant, as well.  

Cafe GH reminds of the small Korean restaurants in Chicago and LA.  May just want to keep an eye on your car while you eat.

Tip: You can hit Seoul Market across the intersection to stock up after eating.  Good prices on basics.  Best kimchee selection we've found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love it here!! When I can't get my mom's home cooked Korean food or if I'm to lazy to cook my own this place is the place to go!!  

 ^.^"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!  We have been often and have never had anything we didn't like - our favorites are the duk boki, tang soo yuk (fried beef), cham pong (spicy seafood noodle soup), and jja jjang myun (black bean noodle). We've tried a few other items as well and they have actually all been very good. The ambience is laid back and relaxed, and the owner and the waitress here are absolutely a delight. And they're open till 2am some nights! This is one of our favorite stops on this side of town."}
{"text":"The best place in the valley so far to really good Korean. Service is always good, mama gives you hints on what else to do with your leftovers. Great place. all the sides are to die for."}
{"text":"One of the worst Korean food I've ever had. The bean sprout came on bad. We ordered beef noodle soup, but there's hardly any beef in it. The environment was messy. It was way overpriced. Damn rip off."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in town, hands down!

Food is AMAZING. The place is a bit dirty."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to read the article in Phoenix Mag that mentioned this wonderful place. I had the BiBim Bap with beef for lunch and the serving was so plentiful I did not have dinner that evening. Everything was great and the home made hot sauce was very flavorful with almost a hit of BBQ/smoky flavor, I would not consider it a \"traditional\" hot sauce, but it was wonderful! I gave a four star rating since this is the second time I've tried BiBim Bap and DO NOT consider myself an expert on Korean food, but will be back for more in the future. Don't let the unasuming strip mall turn you away, it is worth the visit."}
{"text":"We came to this place from a fair distance in order to satisfy our Korean food cravings. There's signs on the walls saying they've been voted \"Best in the Valley\" for Korean food, and the aromas seemed promising. But we were very disappointed. 
First, there was one woman who was servicing the entire establishment. This was not so much a problem as there were only two other tables when we initially got there, and there are only a handful of tables there, but as the guests multiplied quickly the service became extremely slow along with it - to the point where my husband had to walk to the front of the restaurant to notify her that we were ready to leave 20 minutes ago and could we kindly have the check?
Next the food. The Korean small plates were all bland, and when I got my Bibimbap bowl, I was equally unimpressed by the flavors. It was apparent the ingredients were fresh, but it was so mediocre that although it came in a large serving size, I didn't even bother to take home leftovers. When I moved my bowl away from me to signify I was done with my meal, my fingers brushed on the bowl and stained my hand black! (See for yourself in my picture!)
Finally - there's no alcohol on the menu!! I put two exclamations points to emphasize this because if you still choose to try this place out, you are going to need a few drinks in you to tolerate the service and bland food. I recommend the sushi place or bar next door to get your fix to forget your troubles."}
{"text":"Don't miss the Hameul Pa Jeon (seafood & veggie pancake) no matter what you do! Awesome banchan. Great food. Do the duk boki too!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere feels like a restaurant along the streets of Korea (not your cleanest of places, but very cozy) with authentic Korean service (for better or worse), meaning the tones can come off rather rude if you are unprepared, but they mean well. For example, my friend had preferred a non-spiced soondubu (soft tofu soup), so she ordered the white soondubu (no pun intended... or maybe just a little pun intended lol). The lady made a face of disgust and said \"Ugh no spicy??? Spicy is much better!\" My friend was a bit surprised/upset by the judgmental tone, but you just have to understand certain interactions among Asians and not take it personally.

Cons:  They are rather stingy with banchan, limiting refills to only 2 side dishes... even justifying by saying you are supposed to eat your main entree.  They also recently switched to cash-only (seemingly only for the Asian customers, though I cannot confirm this).

Pros:  Despite the cons, this is truly the best Korean food in Phoenix and comparable to that of K'Town in LA or Korea.  We've tried many of their dishes and some of my favorites are Haemul Pa Jeon (Seafood Pancake), Bibim Naengmyeon (Cold Noodles), Kalbi Tang (Beef Short Rib Soup), and Soondae Jjigae (Blood Sausage Soup).

From our most recent visit:
Haemul Pa Jeon (Seafood Pancake):  Tip: Extra crispy - the intensified aroma teases you from the moment the dish is served... and the satisfying crunch from each bite layers your tastebuds.

Bibim Naengmyeon (Korean Cold Noodles): I crave the naengmyeon I had from Seoul... to this day.  This isn't that, but settles my cravings more than any other naengmyeon in Phoenix. 

Summary:
Service: 2-3 Stars
Food: Definitely worth it"}
{"text":"It is not your Vegas buffet, but you can find a tour of Asia in this west side strip mall sampling cuisine from Japan, Thai, Chinese, and Korean.  We had a party of 13 which took up 1/2 of the restaurant.  I had ordered the cha jang myun (black bean sauce with noodles) and sweet and sour pork.  It is not the typical Chinese version of sweet and sour pork.   The rest of party had ordered Kalbi, sul lung tang (a hearty, luxuriant beef broth made from ox bones), and champong (hot spicy noodle).    The dishes were huge.  I think I over ate, but it was just so good.  Our server was great and she thought of everything before we thought of requesting extra plates for our birthday cake.    They were very accommodating for a large group.  It's a great place I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! How often can we say in Arizona that we have a Korean restaurant open until 2am?!? Not only is that great, but to top it off, the food was excellent. My girlfriend had the squid stir fry which they cut the squid the cross pattern which allowed it to stay soft, and I had the kimchi soup, which was fantastic as well. 

It's a bit far from where I live, but I would love to give it another try when I'm near this area of town!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Korean Food in Arizona- We tried them all and this place is hands down GOOD! from the bachan to the soups.. the spicy pork is so good! when we need our Korean fix, this is the place. Order the korean seafood pancake, spicy pork, and their soups"}
{"text":"Okayish price but food doesn't live up to the hype. Also the portion is not really on the generous side. Beef soup literally had two thin slices of beef and galbi bibimbob had very small amount of meat. But that's not why I'm leaving a one star review. The owner is rude as hell. She literally scolded us for not eating \"correctly\" and just wouldn't stop talking. She put extra salt in my soup and attempted to \"correct\" other people's dishes as well (e.g. mixing the food). Would not recommend for people who doesn't like their food being touched."}
{"text":"I love Café Ga Hyang. 

I'll admit I'm not extremely well versed in Korean cuisine. I'm just a bit beyond the pointing at the menu \"I'll have that\" stage. I do, however, have a Korean food advocate in the family. After spending a time in NYC with two Korean roommates, this family member returned to Arizona with a taste for Korean soap operas and Korean food. She was greatly relieved to find Café Ga Hyang and considers it one of two favorite local Korean spots. I, however, can recognize an outstanding family run restaurant, regardless of ethnicity, when I see one. The location in an aging strip center does not leave a strong initial impression. Do not be deterred. The Korean television, the décor, the private booths, the big long tables, the late hours (open daily until 2:00 a.m.)... and of course the food, will leave a positive lasting impression by the time you depart.. 

The entire restaurant is served by one waitress, which I'm sure slows things down at peak times, but seems to be a way to keep the family in charge of interacting with diners. A great idea if that's the thought process. Our server showed visible concern when we ate very little of one of the dishes we ordered, a genuine reaction you seldom see while dining. No problem with the food. We just ordered too much and expended too much effort on the glorious array of small side dishes. She then packed it up for us to go. We dined in one of the enclosed booths. Fun and very private. We felt like we had the restaurant to ourselves. Simply great service. We also appreciated when a little instruction was volunteered, without the slightest hint of condescension, regarding how to best eat (and enjoy) one of the dishes.

I will definitely volunteer to return whenever the family needs another fix of Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"my wife was not feeling well so we ordered to take out. They were so accomodating and friendly and willing to help me order.
The food was memorable and I go back often. Priced right, not flashy...give this one a try"}
{"text":"Whaaaaaa? They close at two am. Oh em geee. Not like I was craving Korean food  at 12 am or anything. Haha.

I always get the bibimbap no meat., The only thing I can have really, but it is so good. I'm not really a big fan of the stone cooker bowl that came with.. my rice was burnt.  Other than that, but my meal was delicious.

The ambiance is chill and quiet... (til I walk in)  im so loud. Haha"}
{"text":"I've been to this Korean restaurant a few times with my girlfriend.  This is her favorite Korean restaurant to go to.  We always split the xiao xiao mein, while I believe this is considered to be a Chinese dish it is one of the few places we can get it, and in most cases it is quite delicious.  Her go to dish is the seafood  dolsot bibimbap which she absolutely loves, and any other Korean restaurant that we go to either doesn't have it or it just isn't nearly as good.  I generally order the bulgogi which I would say is is pretty good.  The restaurant appears to be family run which I really like, and the people there are always really nice.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is there are some consistency issues where a couple of times the food just wasn't as good."}
{"text":"Finding your favorite cuisine is great. Finding your favorite dish is monumental. Finding your favorite version of your favorite dish is monument-al, shrine-al, temple-al, nativity scene-al. 

Factor in that it's one a.m. and I'm basically just weeping on the floor of this little Korean joint in a strip mall. 

Why? Because Kalbi dol sot bibim bap. So damn crispy. So flavorful. So fresh, 'n' so clean. So egg. The greatest wall of crispy rice action I've ever known... I'm a one-dolsot woman now."}
{"text":"I have tried Korean food in many places in the PHX Metro and I have to say this is one of my absolute favorites.  They offer a wonderful selection of Banchan (side dishes typical of Korean dining.) usually serving up to 8 cheop (dishes) along with steamed rice and the table's entre(s).  Their BBQ items are priced in line with other Korean restaurants in town (a little pricy but average) but the bottomless banchan makes up for it. 
My go to dish here is the Kimchi Stew, especially on a cloudy cool day or after a overindulged night on the town.  I have also made a great lunch out of just the banchan and rice.  

The service has always been excellent and polite.  Finding it may be a little tricky as it is in a strip mall between 43rd and 44th Ave Next to a large AYCE Sushi place and tucked between a Dry Cleaners and a Tattoo Parlor. 

I have found myself willing to drive all the way up here from Downtown PHX just to get my fix, it is THAT good."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the service is slow and way understaffed. We had to wait for almost an hour to get our food because it looked like it was the only one lady in the whole restaurant managing the kitchen and tables. There was some minor communication issues, but for the most part she was friendly. The food is inexpensive here. We spent about $24 for two people and I had leftovers to take home. It was very filling, just wish the service was better. I'll definitely do takeout though."}
{"text":"Very good Korean food, especially for being in the middle of Arizona! There is something for everyone here, even those who are not familiar with Korean/Asian cuisine. 

We ordered the Dak-Galbi (chicken barbeque), Salmon Entree (lightly grilled), and the Spicy Octopus Stir Fry. All were delicious. The ban-chan (traditional side dishes) were all authentic and tasty - try them all even if they look different than what you usually eat!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went for lunch yesterday  and we thought the food wasn't bad. I ended up having the runs all morning and throwing up. My coworker called me and told me he also had the runs. Seem's to me like we got food poisoning. Will not be going back ever."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Korean Restaurants in Glendale. Serves traditional dishes prepared and presented traditionally. On this particular visit the credit card service was down and only accepted cash. Just in case your visiting soon. 
The feel is always very traditional and the decor adds to the feel of the times I ate in Seoul. 
Today I had the Hot Bipimpap. One on my favorite Korean dishes. As always it was delicious and served just like I was in South Korea. The only thing I must point out and I'm just really getting nit picky is the beef did not have the soft fresh taste as this restaurant always has in the past. Aside from that I am pleased with the taste of my meal and the endless sides of Kimshi, and all the other sides traditionally served.
The prices are comparable to any other Korean place around the valley. Fair prices without going overboard. 
One thing I really appreciate is it's always clean. Never been here and it's dirty. Even when it's busy. 
Oh and the water tasted good.  No tap horrible flavor making me want to buy a bottled water."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  BOTH times the service was horrible.  The lady is not very attentive and will get to your table in a not-so-very hurried pace.  On my second trip I had to physically get up from my seat and walk over to let her know we needed service.  The food was decent but the side dishes were horrible.  I almost want to say they were \"old,\" which I know is hard to say because most dishes are spoiled/old but this quality was just so poor that it left a very unpleasant taste in my mouth.  

Side dishes are a critical subset to the entree during any Korean meal.  It is imperative that the side dishes are made from the most fresh ingredients and this did not taste that way.

COST:  3/5
The foods were a bit pricey and as I mentioned above, with the quality of the food I think the price is not worth it.  It would've been different if it was a singular incident but on both my visits this was a common issue.

SERVICE:  1/5
Again, horrible service during both my two visits.  The staff is usually very limited if it's not JUST the lady but even still they are not attentive and not generally carry the situational awareness you would expect from restaurant servers.

FOOD:  3/5
The food was decent.  I ordered the black noodles (Jja Jang Myun).  Quantity is plentiful and the black sauce is very flavorful.  It's not exactly what you might be used to from Korea but it comes close.  I also ordered Dwenjang JJigae (bean curd soup) which was very good but then again, if you are Korean you BETTER know how to make this.

DECOR/AMBIANCE: 4/5
Decent spot on the inside.  The place seems very clean and well-kept.  Seating is plentiful with private booths along one side and large tables for larger groups on the other."}
{"text":"Everyone had raved about this place and it was on a long list of joints to check out. I'm now extremely angry I didn't try it sooner. It took a while to warm up to the ambiance, but as soon as Sun came out with our food it was like we were welcomed guests in her home. She showed us the best flavor combinations and even dished out plates for us to share. And the food... the flavors were varied and rich, and the dishes marked spicy actually had serious heat. My sister-in-law, who used to live in Korea, even commented at how much the food brought back great memories.

Speaking of the food, the Haemul Pajeon was a hit with all of us; it's huge, with the perfect crisp on the outside and hearty chunks of seafood in a tender pancake/omelette (whatever you want to call it). With a touch of sauce it is delightful. You can tell there is so much care taken in the preparation of these dishes, even the green tea ice cream mochi was served sliced, with a beautiful drizzle of subtle sauce (aloe, maybe?) and whipped cream. I'm totally sold on another strip mall treasure."}
{"text":"It's different but the sweet and sour pork was really good. Love that it's open late and I mean late 1am."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here tonight with the International Supper Club and it was really good! I have only had Korean food a few times before and this was by far the best I've had (the other places were in Seattle, so that's pretty good). The lady who worked there was helpful, a little stressed out, but helpful. She managed to get everyone's food out at around the same time and it was all steaming hot...literally steaming. I had the spicy soup with sliced beef and it was really good. I thought it could be a little spicier, but it had a lot of flavor and the beef fell apart. The BF had the bulgogi and it was amazing! Very soft and flavorful. The sides were all interesting...we got 4 sets of 7-8 side dishes to share. The tofu side was the best, and I don't particularly like tofu, but this was firm, spicy, and delicious. The bok choy, spicy potato, cucumbery thing, and kim chi were all very good. Now, this place is not particularly cheap, but we had so much food, it was crazy! Plus, it all tasted good. I would definitely come back here in the future!"}
{"text":"My party of 7, including 3 kids, came here for a late night dinner.  From the outside, we couldn't see through the windows and we thought maybe it was a bar and stayed by our car, but after letting the men go inside, they came back out to get us.  Being from Hawaii, I felt pretty much at home here because there was a flat screen TV showing Korean dramas and it made me think of my mom back home who watches them all the time.  One thing that my party wanted was meat jun/chun, but there wasn't any one the menu.  We ordered galbi and a soup to share with the table that had octopus and beef.  After we put in our order, it took a while for us to get any food and I didn't even expect the banchan side dishes to come out before our entrees came out.  The galbi tasted good and it came with the huge bones that my husband likes to gnaw on.  The soup was spicy but chock full of octopus, clams, mussels, shrimp, and beef.  It had to cook on the propane portable stove for a few minutes to cook the raw octopus and beef that was visible on top of the soup.  I didn't have room for dessert, but everyone else wanted to eat their mochi ice cream but the lone lady serving us said there was no mochi so everyone opted to eat the red bean ice cream.  This place was a lifesaver for us Hawaii people visiting Phoenix as we were dying to eat rice and at a place that was open late."}
{"text":"One of the few really good Korean food in the valley.  Service is amazing.  Best seafood pancake I've ever had.  This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've had Korean food in lots of cities in the US, this place still blows my mind with the flavor! Nothing like a little old Korean lady who likes to show you how she ate when she grew up in Korea. She's even fed me when I didn't know how to use some of the sauces. Aside from her being friendly, you can taste the love and hard work they put in their food. The Banchan is never the same here due to Sun, making whatever she's growing in her garden at the current season. This is one of the many reasons why I love the owner of this place. Some of my favorites are, baby fern stems, sesame leaves, and her Napa kimchi. The Duk bokki here is to die for. I normally ask to have Rick(the chef) make it with fish broth instead of water(try this when you visit, you can thank me later). You can't go wrong with the seafood pancake either. It's good for parties of 4, unless you're hungry then get it :) I have several things I like to eat for dinner but my ultimate is spicy short rib soup :) Even during the peak of summer in Phoenix, I get this. It's that delicious! Pork belly stir fried with kimchi and tofu, is amazing! The fried mackerel is delicious. Oh you can't forget about the pork belly bulgogi...comes with sesame oil to dip in and ooh la la. This is heaven in a bite! This place has the flavors that will spoil and ruin your taste for any other Korean food. I'm so happy this place is in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Food is a 2/5 but service is a -3/5.
My tofu stew was bland and the sides all tasted the same. The owner was very rude and ignored me throughout my visit. While I was eating she came to my table and slammed my bill on the table and walked away without saying anything. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Been here three times so far, it hasn't let me down yet. The last experience was a feast!  Most times I end up with lots of leftovers. If you can, save room for their ice cream tempura."}
{"text":"Yes says our 5 year old friend. She liked everything, and the three adults with her. We had two different hot pots and one soup. All were great!"}
{"text":"bulgogi so delish
order lots of yummy food
yayy"}
{"text":"If you have a Korean relative (in this case my mom) and want to get fresh authentic Korean food this is where to go. My parents were both so blown away they almost wandered into the starlight lounge to start drinking and dancing! Talk about a food-high. The owner/ server was so accommodating (it helped that mom spoke fluent Korean if course) she helped us order the right things for us. 
My mom couldn't stop talking about how well everything was made, no extra flavoring/salt or msg. A RARITY among restaurants. Everything I tried here is great, even the desert ice cream was delicious and not typical mochi from the box carton :) 
Sometimes those small, unassuming joints are the best places for authenticity and quality (actually this most of the time in my experience)."}
{"text":"LOVE KOREAN FOOD. Good place, great authentic people. Love the small side dishes. always ready to eat. Though recently they started serving smaller portions of their side dishes which is really disappointing. Servers though do have good recommendations and will provide helpful answers to any questions you may have about the menu."}
{"text":"we came to Phoenix late at night and we couldn't find an open place next to our hotel. Finally we discovered this place and we came there at 1 am, the place was empty, but it didn't make the place bad. The lady who served us gave us very good recommendations about the menu and it was amazing!!! Everything was very delicious and served in a very cool way! Thanks for hospitality at 1 am))"}
{"text":"I think this is the only decent Korean restaurant in Arizona that we found. Our group was sick of the greasy and fatty foods we've been eating that weekend and seeked out some food from the motherland. We found this place, literally out in the boonies. We pulled into the lot, and I swear it looked like an abandoned strip mall. There were only maybe 2 other cars in the huge parking lot.  

I can't speak for what the other's ordered, but I got the nengmyun(cold noodles) combo with kalbi(beef short rib). It was seriously one of the worst nengmyuns I've ever had. I had to douse the whole broth with mustard to drown out the weird taste. The only saving grace was the kalbi. It was pretty damn good. The lady who ran the restaurant was really nice too. She hooked it up with extra banchan(side dishes) and rice. 

I don't know how this place is still in business though... it was peak lunch hour and there was only one other group there eating."}
{"text":"Really great noodles, all of the side dishes were somewhat spicy, but we tried all of them. I already have my nest dish chosen for my next visit and will take someone new so we can also order the seafood pancake. Hostess was very helpful and even cut up the meat off the bones  of the beef soup that I ordered."}
{"text":"Food is okay but their service was horrible. I ordered a fried ice cream after meal and the waitress apparently being so annoyed and she said it would take very long because the restaurant was very busy. But the restaurant didn't seem packed."}
{"text":"If you are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine, this would be a good place to start.  What's great about this place is its super low key.  It's situated in a really run down plaza so you wouldn't even know it existed.  Honestly, you would have to do a Yelp Search just to find out.

What I like:

+ Bibimbap: It's pretty good here, the flavors shine through while keeping the rice slightly crisped for that stone cooking taste.  I can have these weekly!

+ Banchan: super good

+ Ambiance: its dimmed and chill

+ Staff: I've always come here late so I've only known the one lady that takes your order, she is super sweet.

+ Hours: Opens till 2am daily.  Awesome! If I ever have a late night crave, I'm coming here for sure

+ Pricing: Not terrible but reasonable.

The menu  offers plenty of your typical Korean and more.  This place is legit, so if you never had, drop by."}
{"text":"Ahhh if only this place was closer to my house! I love it!  I usually come and order the kalbi and a bowl of duk mandu soup.  But this time I decided to order the dolsot bibimbap which is basically a Korean version of fried rice in a stone hot pot. I usually let it sit for a while so the bottom of my rice gets crunchy.  This is true comfort food.  

The lady (assuming the owner) is very friendly and will help you with any questions you have.  The only odd thing was that my son wanted to drink an iced tea and she gave me a confused look and questioned how a little boy would like an iced tea.  Weird.  

They also state they are open until 2 am every night, but the hubs came one night at 1 am with his buddies and they were closed - it must have been a slow night."}
{"text":"You will not regret going here at all!!! 

A lot of reviews drag on for way too long so I will keep this short, sweet  and to the point.

Service was great! Sue was who helped us and she was the best!! She gave suggestions  and was extremely friendly 

All 4 of us got something different and Everything tasted home cooked and cooked extremely well! We left nothing behind and have not one complaint. 

It's very small and cozy. It doesn't look too appealing from the street. But if you have a chance to eat here DO IT!"}
{"text":"Please don't judge this place by the \"I'm entitled to everything because I'm the customer and the customer is always right\" mentality, because the ladies don't give a crap.  If you're hungry, they'll feed you.  If you're looking for the royal treatment, go somewhere else.  

This place reminds me of a lot of the restaurants in Korea, where ahjumma's () take your order and treat you like a niece or nephew.  At least they bring you water; a lot of places in Korea are self-service.  

In that regards, I can say this place is the most authentic Korean restaurant in the state.  
Also, they're open until like 2 AM.  Hell yes.  

Most of the food is great.  I'm Korean, and I've tried most of everything on the menu. 

Yes, their kimchee-jjigae is made differently than my moms, but it's still tasty as hell.  
So are a lot of the other dishes and banchans.  You can't expect the same style of Korean food in every restaurants, considering even in the tiny country of Korea, there's an estimated 200 types of kimchee.  That's not accounting for how each family makes theirs a little differently.

I'll give you a quick rundown of all the dishes I can remember.

Sullung-tang(/):  The one soup I was disappointed with here.  The broth is weak and not very flavorful.  It's so simple and yet so difficult to get this soup right.  It's no wonder there are many restaurants in Korea that specialize in this one soup only.  

Galbi-tang():  My go-to soup.  OMG this soup is good.  Go have some and thank me later.  Best combo bite with this: put your rice in the soup.  Get a spoonful of soup and rice and then place a nice fermented piece of kimchee/ggahkdugi on top.  Then place in mouth.  Chew and moan.  Repeat.

Shrimp gganpoongi ():  Every person I've taken to this place has loved this.  So much pepper and garlic on it, and yet so good.  They don't skimp out on the shrimp nor the quality/size of the shrimp they use.  Worth every penny.  Don't get as a main dish because that's weird.  Order one for the table and share.  

Ddukbok-i ():  I order this without fail every time I go as the standard starting dish.  
It's slightly different every time, because it's actually cooked here with fresh veggies and peppers.  So so good.  Again, order this as something to share with your loved ones, ordering it as a main dish is weird.

dolsot galbi bibimbap ():  This sizzling bowl of rice with assorted veggies and rib meat is amazing.  See the red ketchup bottle she gives you?  It's not ketchup.  It's magical pepper paste sauce.  Squeeze a pretty pattern on your bowl and mix.  Borrow your neighbors spoon.  It's easier.  Just give them the spoon back full, not empty.  

soon dae guk ():  Pork blood sausage soup.  The sausage isn't homemade, but I don't expect it to be.  It'll do to satisfy my craving for it while I'm away from Korea.  The soup?  Amazeballs.  Fresh perilla leaves with roasted seeds gives this soup a new taste you've probably never tasted before.   

Jjam-bbong():  It's never been my choice, since I've always been on the Jjajangmyun () side of the Jjajang or Jjambbong (  ?) choice.  
Huuuge portions though, and everyone I've seen that ordered it loves it.  If you love seafood and noodles, this is for you.

Jjajangmyun (): I've tried this once and didn't really care for it.  Not bad but not amazing like some of the dishes I've reviewed above.  Another reason many restaurants in Korea specialize in this dish.  It's the #1 delivery food in Korea.  

Jaeyook-bokkeum ():  stir-fried well-ripened kimchee and pork-belly pieces are a little sweet for my taste but still very good.  One downside, they are very stingy with the meat in this dish.  You've got to go fishing around for it and there's not much to go around.  I've ordered this 2-3 times and it hasn't changed.  

Final word:  The Korean law of \"Jung\" () dictates that when you go enough to be a regular and develop a likable relationship with the staff, the number and amount of premium side dishes and meat chunks in your galbi-tang or fish cakes in your ddukbok-i doubles.

Edited:  I typed in all the Korean in parentheses, but I guess yelp doesn't support it."}
