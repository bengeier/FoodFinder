{"text":"A wonderfully fresh hang out spot where you can play table tennis and drink/eat at the same time.  Quite spacious and lively and from their schedule on the wall, they have quite a few specials/deals for each day of the week.    I would be more psyched if I played any table tennis.  If you are not playing, there are a few high tables for seating in the centre.  The few kraft beer we ordered were canned only.  The food menu is interesting, but mostly in small portions, so don't look to have a big meal here.    It was not extremely busy when we were here, but balls are flying each and every way, so expect to be hit at least once or twice while here.  It's got an overall fun vibe."}
{"text":"Much in the same manner your balls go from one side to the other with every stroke*, so to do the flavours of Whiff Waffs menu move from East to West inspiration with every sip and bite  *...of the ping pong paddle (AND Ping Pong 'Balls'). Get yer brain out of the gutter for Pete's Sake!!!  Now that I have your attention, you should know that no longer do you need to venture to the likes of SPIN in Toronto for Ping Pong (PP) fun. Add to that menus true to trends and the local communities and you've got yourself one badass night out.  Ok so, let's get this out of the way... WTF is a Whiff Waff? Funny you should ask, because I had the same question, but a quick search of the businesses website and you'll find the following interesting factoid -- \"The name whiff waff was created by Slazenger on December 31, 1900.  No one knows why they chose such an odd name.  Some may explain the whiff as a slight gust of wind, but not the waff, though that is a Scottish word meaning a waving movement.  Whatever the reason was, we know the game today as table tennis or ping pong.\"  So now you know... and knowing is....? That's right Half the battle!  So you're here with your friends enjoying a round of PP/TT/WW in their near 6000 sq ft facility (Which if you're wondering where it is - it's in the former location of Richmond Hill's Honest Lawyer Bar)... and you're thinking \"Hey, I'm thirsty and I could eat\". Well sir/maam you're in for a treat.  A quick glance at the menu might tell you, meh, typical pub food, close but no cigar. Upon a closer inspection, you'll notice that all the western bar/pub favourites (tacos, wings, poutine, flatbreads and desserts) all have weird and wonderful ingredient combinations with strong Eastern influence!  We had - Szechuan Peppercorn Salt Edamame Beans - Fried Tofu Lettuce Wraps - Thai Curry Vegetable Gyoza - Five Spice Duck Tacos - Kalbi Short Rib Poutine  Each item was basically a home run, with my faves being the Poutine and Tacos (should have ordered 6 more). Absolutely Excellent.  The Cocktails were equally complex with our tables favourite being the Korean Soju infused Mojito known as the Sojito (LMFAO). They also have an assortment of Japanese beers beyond the usual LCBO suspects.   One bugaboo as the night wore on was the service. The venue was empty when we arrived and while our server was nice, she lacked in a strong enough grasp of the menu to make any sort of recommendations (stating, oh yeah, it's ok, it's good). And in addition, she ghosted on us to chat on her phone and with the bar staff on several occasions leaving us alone for long periods in the midst of service. I don't think this is a reflection of the venue or all staff, but this one server definitely needs to brush up on her customer service and product knowledge.  Overall, a very good experience, near perfect, and I would highly recommend you check them out, they've been open since December last/January this year!  Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Place is spacious and mainly have table tennis with one billiard table, and one foosball table. There are a few bar-like areas to sit at but inconvenient with one coat rack in the middle of the open space. There are balls everywhere on the floor and staff members go around once in a while to recollect. Unless you really enjoy table tennis, I don't really recommend this place. The staffs weren't too friendly either."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5. But it's closer to 4 than 3. Good fun spot. And surprisingly decent food. You really need to upgrade the taco shells if you are to get the tacos. Also the bar mixologist had a nice beverage. One comment would be that it's just too bright for it to be a lounge. Or feel like a lounge.  Don't drink and drive Cheers"}
{"text":"Whiff Waff Bar & Lounge! Came here for a date and it was super duper cute! Would definately come here again with more friends. It is quite new. Although I came here on a Wednesday night, it was quite quiet. After talking to the waitress, she said it does get packed on the weekends, they do offer bottle service, and you can even request to have your own party room.   Very similar concept to the SpiN Ping Pong Lounge downtown. They keep this place clean, and very good.  Beer- on tap is all IPAs, but they do have other options in bottles.   Food- Unique asian fusion tapas menu. Though I didn't have any because I ate before coming, I would definitely come back to try it. I hear it's good!!"}
{"text":"Took a group for dinner and ping pong. The service was great the food was great. Our ping pong ability not so great. Everyone enjoyed and said they would come back again."}
{"text":"Ping pong joint. Large space has a private room..Great for birthday parties or company parties. Food was decent nice cold beers. I enjoyed their Kim chi ceasar quite a bit. But there were fruit flies everywhere and tons in the washrooms."}
{"text":"Great place for ping pong in York region. From 5-7pm on weekdays, they have $5 amsterdam pints and $8 signature mixed drinks. Awesome service and excellent place to hang out after work. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you like playing billiards, you'll probably like Whiff Whaff too! It's definitely a hidden gem as it doesn't receive as much publicity as it should. Essentially it's a ping pong lounge fused with a bar and social food. I was surprised at how spacious the area was. There are tables to the side, and high tables in the middle for eating. There's also very comfortable seating all along the sides of the venue, which was really cool. Individual washrooms as well. The layout made a lot of sense and everything felt clean and slick.  For a lounge, the food was definitely not bad at all. Almost everything was shareable and was surprisingly good. We also tried the drinks, the fave of the night being the cucumber and watermelon sojito. You can definitely see the asian fusion in the menu.  What I really liked about the place was that there was enough room between the tables so there's privacy and you're not worrying about hitting someone else. All the equipment felt new and there was a worker coming around regularly picking up ping pong balls so you won't step on them!  I also gave a quick look on the website, there's tonnes of different specials for all walks of life: seniors, students, etc. The DJ on Fridays is also really good. For b-days, outings, get togethers, Whiff Whaff is awesome! 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Mark my words that this place will not last another year if it keeps going at its current rate.  The ping pong was alright, but the food was just awful. I ordered a pork poutine and it was bathed in an inch of oil. The fries were cold and soggy, and the cheese curds didn't even melt. No lies, it was probably the worst poutine I've ever had in my life.  Also, for such a \"hot\" spot, this place was completely dead on a Friday. The servers seemed very apathetic,  and were wrapped up in their own conversations to pay any attention to us. I won't be coming back."}
