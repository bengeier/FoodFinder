{"text":"I can't deny it and even if I wanted to it wouldn't be in my nature to lie about this, but I went to Mayo to run many tests that had to be done all day and so I was starving when I stopped at their cafeteria and was blown away by all the choices offered for lunch. I ordered myself a turkey burger that day and it was quite tasty. I love the ambience and how the employees were very friendly. Also this cafeteria is huge and CLEAN."}
{"text":"Never been dissatisfied and have eaten here many times.   Very good value for the money. Always a good variety and taste.   My wife really appreciates the coffee bar and that they serve Starbucks."}
{"text":"I have had many opportunities to eat at the Mayo cafeteria and I always amazed with the food selection and hot specials!

Great quality, home made specials at a very reasonable price!

As I have said before, it's a good thing that I don't live near here, I would be eating here every day!"}
{"text":"I know this sounds crazy, but the food is really great.  They have a great salad bar and all their soups are freshly made along with their muffins and desserts.  They cater to people from around the world, so you can get asian, vegetarian and any other food your heart desires.  Really, a jewel in the desert. One can dine in a pleasant setting on an outside patio.  The restaurant has its own entrance so you don't have to go into the hospital."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a hospital cafeteria!!!  Fresh, made-to-order sandwiches at the Deli Bar (think Subway), many selections of hot meals with nutrition facts listed on the menu, plus pre-made salads with yogurt and other single-serve foods.  And don't forget the salad bar, at $.35/pound has a wonderful selection of fresh ingredients. 

Examples of food from my family's visit:  a generous scoop of delicious chicken salad, with nuts & grapes, on a small bed of fresh greens for $2.15, hard-boiled egg for $.75; 12\" spinach-wrap Deli sandwich with pepper turkey, pepper-jack cheese, romaine lettuce and horseradish sauce for $4.40.  

Like I said, as good as it gets for cafeteria food!  Try it..."}
{"text":"Upsides: Surprisingly good food for breakfast, lunch and dinner - with very clearly posted nutritional information for the daily entrees (low cal - but high in taste and portions). 

Downsides: 
- You are surrounded by a lot of impulse junk food and other higher priced items. 
- a stone age checkout system (and comical credit card procedure)
- incredibly noisy cafeteria atmosphere (but what do you expect!)
- I find most of the items rather pricy for a cafeteria.

Upsides:
- Lots of healthy food available
- If it's a nice day out, the outdoor seating is very pleasant.
- there are times when the eating area is very sparse and quiet ... when this happens, it is a great place to do a little work or enjoy a quick lunch.
- but most times it is noisy, and crowded with families and patients (in patient gowns, and dragging IVs on wheels!)

And, if instead you get sucked into buying a lot of the less-healthier food and start having a heart attack, well, it's Mayo Clinic and you have the best heart specialists in the world probably 10 feet away."}
{"text":"On Friday our Dr. told us to reduce our sodium intake. Today we were in for follow up and decided to have lunch at the hospital cafeteria. The featured salad had 2500 mg of sodium.  There were no low sodium options.  Shame on you! You should be setting an example of healthy food choices.  No lunch for us."}
{"text":"So sad, featured salad today had 2600 mg of salt!!! There were no low sodium choices. Shame on Mayo!  You should be a model of healthy eating."}
{"text":"If you dont mind eating at a hospital then it's great! Used to come here for labs etc and always made time to get food after. The prices are cheap and you get good sized portions. The menu changes everyday so do expect the same thing all the time. Burgers are great. Veggie burgers sometimes. Big salad variety. Awesome French fries. You can even get an ice cream bar there!! Do t let Mayo scare you away. Plus it's the only place to go if you get really sick!!"}
{"text":"This cafeteria is under new management.   It is no longer operated by Mayo Clinic, and it's quality (lack of!) shows.   The food options are generally less tasty, and on average more expensive.  Also, the employees are held to strict standards of portion control.  It is really a sad experience because in the old days these fine employees really shined for their outstanding service, but now are held down by new management practices."}
{"text":"Employees, volunteers, and patients... 

I eat here Monday through Friday, sometimes for breakfast and lunch. They deviate from the typical stereotypical hospital food. They serve high-quality food for a fraction of the price of what you would get any restaurants. Employees also get discounts. They have three different cafeterias at the Phoenix campus - hospital, clinic building for patients, and clinic building for staff. On a typical day, they serve several sauteed dishes, salad bar, pizza, deli bar, and pastries. Meals macronutrients and calories are posted for people to track. There are also baristas to make Starbucks coffee. They also have farmer markets groceries available in the refrigerator. The cafeteria staff always have a positive vibe and makes the highlight of my day."}
{"text":"Great food for a hospital. Definitely impressed.

Pros:

1.  Plenty of parking for people to visit. Easy to find off the main highway (you want to take the 56th Street exit). Parking is free.

2.  Never thought I would say this but their lunch room is top notch. Great selection of food, labeled with nutritional information, and definitely tasty. Also, not break the bank prices. If I lived/worked in the area I would stop by here just for the lunch, that's how good it was to me.

Cons:

1.  None, I definitely approve of this place. Your health plan might be the issue for long-term care but I would definitely want to go here."}
{"text":"Mayo cafeteria is typical hospital food.  We don't feel it is anything other than ok.  We have eaten here many time when we have had an appointment and no time to leave and come back.   I would not eat here by choice.  The food is blah and unless you add  spice of some kind.   I love Mayo but not the food!!!"}
{"text":"In the words of David Dennison, how SAD that this place is not what it used to be. Food quality has taken a significant nosedive and it's obvious that the kitchen had been hired out to some sort of other company. On top of that, the prices have gone up substantially so they no longer feel like a good value. 

Eggs are rubbery. Breakfast potatoes are tiny little pieces that have been deep fried and therefore basically are crunchy French fries. Raw broccoli pieces in salad bar are enormous (who would eat these?) and less than fresh and cherry tomatoes completely without flavor.

So SAAD!"}
{"text":"Hospital food and Hospital Cafeteria food have been given a bad rap over the years. 

I've eaten here many times, and have also been an inmate next door as well. The food is good. Not Talking Stick Buffet good, but Three Stars, A-Okay good. You will also find the Barista Coffee Bar is better than the Green Mermaid in many ways. 

I've never seen or eaten anything that has been wilted or gone bad. I have watched however, them taking the temperature of the the food they are cooking, to make sure it's done. But everything here is good. 

If on the other hand you want something more gourmet, that has a certain \"je ne sais quoi \", then get in your car and drive two minutes to Desert Ridge and eat at MiDiCi Pizza. 

BTW, No lettuce or tomatoes have been harmed in the writing of this review!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Food was precooked sitting out cold. Eggs cold-bacon cold. The only thing hot was the coffee. Yes it was inexpensive but horrible."}
{"text":"I'm thankful I get to work where there is an amazing cafeteria.... Lots of choices and prices are super cheap!"}
{"text":"What a great hospital cafeteria! Almost everything is labeled with nutritional information, and the entrees on offer are fairly health-conscious, so you really have to try to eat poorly here (i.e. go to the grill line).  For example, I had an entree of chicken penne with mushroom sauce and a side of pesto roasted cauliflower for ~450 calories.

Everything is also extremely inexpensive.  A milk carton is $0.75, entrees are $3-4, and sides are $1.  The brand name items, like Haagen-Dazs ice cream bars and Sabra hummus, are a bit more expensive, but still cheaper than a convenience store.  A full meal couldn't possibly cost more than $7.

For breakfast, the cafeteria serves oatmeal with toppings, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, eggs, grits, bacon, sausage, and biscuits with gravy.  The deli (made to order sandwiches), salad bar, and grill open at 11am for lunch.  Lunch ends at 3, but the grill stays open through dinner.  It's nice that the cafeteria doesn't close up completely between meals like at some hospitals!  

My only complaint is that I wish they had more yogurt options available.  It's the only healthy choice that isn't abundant here!

While I wouldn't purposely check yourself in to partake of the food, this cafeteria reflects the quality of the hospital as a whole."}
{"text":"This is the only hospital cafeteria I have ever enjoyed being at. They have a deli section that makes custom sandwiches, you can order just like subway :) And the Entree line has at least 4-5 choices with a very nice fish every time. And the best part... A ice cream section!!! Yes that's right, and let me say it's about time, what better time to have serious comfort food! BTW they have a large selection of healthy choices as well, so you can add fruit to your ice cream :)"}
{"text":"If you are in the Mayo Hospital ya gotta eat here...I don't mean that as a quirky suggestion...it's a fact. You Must eat here, there is nowhere else within walking distance...unless you are a long distance runner.
but it's clean.
good selection.
the staff doesn't speak much (though it IS a cafeteria)
good place to eat if you only have one choice."}
{"text":"They say food is good for the soul. Mayo may care for your body, but they don't seem  to care for your soul; unless they believe bad food is good for the soul. The high reviews are before Mayo sold out and contracted with a new company. I ate here several times and did not care for the food. I love clam chowder and theirs was so bad I ate two bites and had to toss the rest. The burgers are precooked and kept on a steam table. When you order a burger, they put it back on the griddle to heat it and melt the cheese. They have a rotating menu of various dishes, many of which did not resemble the name. I love meatloaf, but they did something to it that made it scary to order. Luckily they have a wide variety of 'easy' prepackaged foods which is a plus since they can't mess that up."}
{"text":"When I got there at 10:30am, then were temporary closed and setting up for lunch at 11am.  UGH, but they were nice enough to let me purchase a chocolate muffin and an ice tea.  But the food they are preparing were smelling very very good!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! And because it's a hospital there are healthy alternatives. And they have Starbucks coffee! 
They make it easy to either dine in or get it to go. It's always clean and never crowded. Very inexpensive too. I had a tasty dinner for about $5."}
{"text":"Way better than an ordinary cafeteria, and much better than a typical hospital cafeteria! 

Food selection is varied, healthy, and good. Nutritional information is also posted, so if you're watching calories you can plan your meal."}
{"text":"They have a new cafeteria in the new cancer center building that is really nice, pizza made to order, panini bar, gourmet coffee bar and much more!"}
{"text":"Boston's Mass General Hospital cafeteria and this one are the two best hospital cafs in the world. 

Great, made to order food, at reasonable prices. 

Lunch specials every day make it even better."}
{"text":"The food is good but some of the servers behind the buffets lack the same level of service that Mayo medical staff demonstrate."}
{"text":"Check out the patient cafeteria in the clinic building. It is less crowded and food is made to order.  They always offer some healthy options including low sodium."}
{"text":"Unbelievable how inexpensive and great quality the food is here and the staff (as throughout Mayo) are wonderful"}
{"text":"An omelet with 4 ingredients, for under $4.00?  No way.  And it was good!!  I really like this cafeteria.  The employees are friendly, from the people behind the food counters, to the cashiers.

We'll definitely come and eat breakfast here, when we're not visiting the hospital in a medical situation."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in recent weeks & have found the food to be very good. Today my husband had the meatloaf meal & I had Pad Thai & spring rolls. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"I am seriously confused by these reviews. I think lack of availability has led to some serious delusions. Think Subway for the deli bar? Whaaa? Two vegetable options. Lettuce and mushy tomatoes. Don't even get me started about the styrofoam they tried to pass off as bread. 

This is no different than any other hospital cafeteria. Tasteless subpar food. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"My Mom had treatment at the Mayo Hospital which lead to the discovery of this place. What grabbed me first are the homemade soups - they are all excellent. I avoided the area that served burgers and fries and went to he section that had daily specials on a variety of dinners. I have been back several times just to grab a quick lunch. The cream of mushroom soup is the best I have had - ever."}
{"text":"I work for the hospital and am fortunate enough to get to eat here every day. The value blows everything else out of the water - including bringing my own lunch. Breakfast usually runs between $1 and $3 and lunch and dinner is typically between $2 and $5 and you can save even more if you ask for a Live Well punch card (free meal after 5 Live Well selections).

There are daily specials and tons of healthy options. I appreciate that the nutritional information is posted for each item so you can make smart decisions. I have worked at several valley hospitals and the food offered at Mayo Clinic is so much healthier and better tasting."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday afternoon and the espresso bar was closed as was the deli sandwich section which left us with the grill.

I was okay wIth that, I ordered a burger and the cook pulled out a burger from the metal warming container and then threw it on the grill. Come on! At least he did not microwave it!

Also ordered a hot dog and it came with a pickle, so I ate it Chicago Style which was not bad.

Had a side of onion rings which were cold.

The burger bun was hard the burger meat itself did not do anything for me, the onion rings were stiff and cold and the hot dog was no better than QT.

Maybe I ate there on a bad day because it was bad, for the people that ate here and praised the food I think I ate in a different place because eating at Good Sam's cafeteria with roaches and all was a lot better than what we experienced."}
