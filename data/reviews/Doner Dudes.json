{"text":"When first walking into the small restaurant, one is greeted with stylish decor and a small but diverse menu. U of A alumni be warned, this restaurant is clearly catering to ASU students, with pitchfork flags and a menu item affectionately named after everyone's favorite Sun Devil. Overall, it is a fun, upbeat, CLEAN place to walk into and you would enjoy eating inside if you choose. They even accept M&G which is great for ASU students.
They offer 3 typed of protein: Chicken, Beef and Kisir (a wheat-based protein). I have only had the chicken and the beef, and it must be the way of cooking and thinly cutting the meat because it is always moist and flavorful. You can then choose between fries or salad as a base, or have it as a sandwich. For the $8.99 price, only the fries and the salad or worth it; the sandwich is far too small and the bread is often dry. There are 6 styles of Doner you can get: German, Veggie, Aussie, Mid-East, Southwest and Sparky. All of the doners are good depending on what you like, however there is a problem with consistency that I will get to later. On salad, my favorite is the Mid-East Doner because the tahini sauce goes very well with the salad. On fries (which are the best in the area, by the way) I love the Sparky Doner, which has mac n' cheese, beef and spicy sauce that all taste really good together. I always order the Sparky Doner unless I am in a healthy mood.
Moving on to the drink menu, they offer a variation of coffee drinks. The single espresso is very sour and probably the worst I've ever had in Tempe, but I don't know who would order a single espresso from Doner Dudes except out of pure curiosity which was why I did. The coffee drinks however are delicious, not as sweet as Starbucks but still with a lot of flavor. I love the Turkish Adderall and Hangover RX, which are both as enjoyable as they are appropriately named. For 3.99, you are getting a better, larger drink than from Starbucks at a slightly lower price. No complaints here. 
Now for the problem: when I first started going in Fall 2017, I always ordered the Mid-East Doner on salad. They were NOT consistent with what toppings. Sometimes they put this mustard tasting sauce, sometimes they put a tangy darker sauce. Always different ingredients to go on the salad for the exact same Doner. One time (for the first time), they put peanuts on my order which is not listed to go in on the menu. If you have food allergies, I would avoid eating here because there is a risk you could get something you are allergic to. However, this happened a few months ago and ever since I've been ordering the Sparky Doner, which is consistent. It seems that the employees that would mess up the orders are no longer working at the restaurant, and the two that are there currently seem to know what they are doing. Still, I can't say whether all the issues have been fixed because I have only been ordering the Sparky Doner. 

Overall, I would rate 4 stars because the food I order is very good, but I have had bad experiences in the past that make me wary of trying other Doners. I also am not a fan of the small size and dry taste of the sandwich option. The fries are the best that you can get in the area, which is impressive considering there is a french fry place right next door. The coffees are wonderful and I would recommend trying as many as you can. The servers are nice and are friendly when you order, but not particularly talkative."}
{"text":"Great Lamb meat.. very flavorful and delicious. I only rated this 4 stars though as I was simply dying for a doner sandwich just like they have all over Europe. This was close, but they only had the regular cucumber yogurt sauce and not the garlicky sauce I craved. The bread was thin and crispy and pretty delicious. Definitely the best meat I've had in AZ!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with this place. I love döner and have had it many times before when abroad. I thought that for 9 bucks I would get a huge portion however this was far from reality. The meat is weighed and they already have it cut when you order which I think takes away a big part of the experience. The toppings were very limited and overall the flavor was a bit good. Expected more from this place."}
{"text":"I had a custom build it yourself lamb and beef, extra spicy Doner and fries. The owner was there and he is super friendly and explained all our options. Meat was fresh cut off the spit! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Way too stingy with the meat, it's weighed and pre cut which personally was a no for me as it doesn't take very long to shave it fresh. Another thing was the topping options were a bit limited and also the carrots and onions were sliced way too big. For a college place it's not horrible but probably won't be coming back. 

Also note all the bread I had to take off from the edges."}
{"text":"Doner dudes is my new favorite spot! So tired of of the usually Jimmy Johns and dominos so when I found this place I was instantly hooked! Their food is not only delicious, but healthy and super fresh. Did I mention they have coffee AND smoothies?! Ugh I visit at least three times a week for one of their yummy peach mango smoothies. Oh and they take m&g! Super convenient, if only they were here when I had m&g. Great place, super friendly staff and overall awesome scene. Stop reading this review and just head on in!!"}
{"text":"They recently opened up near my dorm on campus, and I decided to give them a try. My main issue is the portions that are served, they weigh the meat by ounce. It seems like they want you to buy extra meat ($2.99). Unlike other places like Halal Guys, you leave this place feeling like you wasted your money, and still feel hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"Really less quantity. Very stingy with the meat and all the other items at all. The extras are pretty much a scam. So overall it's pretty expensive for what they give. The taste was good, so for that I'll give 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've been looking for an actually donor in the decade since moving back from Germany. Sandwich was alright, definitely not a donor kabab though, the search continues."}
{"text":"Food is good! Use to get fries as a snack all the time but they changed them. You get less per order and they aren't as seasoned or crispy. Other than that good place to go! Still miss Sweeto Burrito though."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to grab some Mediterranean food. The toppings are fresh, the proteins are delicious and the whole place is extremely clean and nice. Prices are good and the staff is awesome. The owner is incredibly friendly and is truly making some great food"}
{"text":"Excellent Turkish döner kebab joint!

The workers are extremely nice and the atmosphere is relaxed and amicable, not to mention it is super clean as well. You customize your own kebab wrap in the same manner as Subway. There's not much of a seating area inside, but there's plenty of tables outside.

The food is excellent, as was expected, and beats out many competing Mediterranean street-style restaurants. I will definitely be coming back to try another style of wrap. :)"}
{"text":"This is the döner place I've been waiting for in arizona.  I got a döner with chicken swarma and it was delicious.  If you've never had a döner you you should try this place. If you love döners you should eat here."}
{"text":"Having spent some time in Germany, I got addicted to Doner. Each time I returned home to Phoenix, the craving grew. I came by Doner Dudes website by accident and had to try it. I am happy to say, in many ways it holds up to my memories and satisfies by taste buds!"}
{"text":"I tried the meet its really good but very very salty !
I hope it become better next time
Good luck"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! It took me back to my travels in Europe. The meat was lean. The cucumber sauce was amazing! The combo of flavors was perfect! We will be coming back for more. And my kids with tons of food sensitivities were won over by the chicken and fries. A winner all around for our whole family."}
{"text":"Very happy I ordered the Sparky Doner on bread. It was a perfectly wrapped chicken, Mac n cheese & French fry sandwich that came with a yummy sauce. I also ordered the Veggie Doner on greens which I can't wait to try. Also glad I tried the pomegranate cheesecake, the flavor was on point. Can't wait to try other menu items from here!"}
{"text":"Delicious! If you have never tried a doner ... come to this place! Their doner sandwich is very authentic compared to  Europe . If you are trying to avoid bread ask for a doner bowl.  Super fast and friendly! ."}
{"text":"Stopped by to visit a friend at ASU and I'm not sure if they knew I was from University of Arizona or what but my food was not good at all. Very likely could have been some sabotage from me being in sundevil territory, but nothing about my German doner was appealing. They literally just made new fries for our order and they still tasted bland and terrible, the taste did not compliment the meat and toppings at all. At the very least, the place was relatively inexpensive for such a prime location and the service was good."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, and very friendly staff. Coming in I thought it was going to be love every other gyro place but döner dudes is so much more. It's not gyros, it's döner. Their meat is the real deal. Delicious spices and quality all around. The addition of red cabbage sets this place above the rest in my opinion. I am a fiend for red cabbage, and döner dudes does it right. I really hope this place succeeds, they deserve it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are a perfect blend of fresh, rich, and satisfying. Not much in the way of seating, but the food is very portable and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Overpriced terrible and disgusting food. A few days ago we ordered chicken and beef doner. The food arrived  wry well package. The the chicken was very salt and bland. The beef doner smelled really bad and gamey. I don't know what kind of beef they used, but it was terrible. We also ordered some Diet Coke with our meals and it too tasted funky! I checked the expiration date and it turn out they were expired two months ago. 
We didn't wanna get sick so we through everything in the garbage."}
{"text":"Ok. I have no idea why this place has 3.5 stars. It deserved a solid 5. The staff was super friendly and the food is amazing. If you don't know what Turkish kebab is, I'm sorry. You should try this place. It is really good. It's healthy meat, the sauces are really good and it's really not too bad on price."}
{"text":"Staff is always incredibly friendly! Perfect for those times you need coffee late at night since they are open until 2am!

Both their chicken and beef is incredibly flavorful and the selection of toppings and sauces is perfect!"}
{"text":"So happy that I stumbled upon this place. Loved the beef doner sandwhich!! The meat is a flavorful gyro style sliced in house and it's stuffed into a hot amazing fluffy bread and you add numerous toppings to your inside the bread pocket---personally enjoyed the cabbage, sumac onions, olive&feta to the sandwich. Then I topped it with the white yogurt sauce and extra hot sauce. Also, I need to mention it's less than 10 bucks and my sandwich was stuffed--like my stomach! I've had doner's many times and this place really knows what they're doing, so happy that this place opened and can't wait to go back!  Few standing seats inside, but plenty of seats outside and they play really nice music!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor! I had their \"aussie\" which comes with either chicken or beef, it's topped with French fries, red cabbage, onion, feta, and house sauce. I also added a creamy spicy sauce they had. Ive had it twice in the past week and 8 love it! The only thing is the price. 8.65 just for the entrée. If they had smaller sandwiches at a more reasonable price I would get it all the time. Pro tip about Tempe in general, use the \"Hooked Deals\" app"}
{"text":"This place is confirmed as halal chicken and meat. The location of the restaurant is perfect for ASU students and nearby ASU. It does not have an interior tables, so it's mostly like a takeout restaurant. Still, there are exterior tables shared with other restaurants.

I had tried Sparky, beef, mac and cheese, fries, and a house sauce. You can have free options for toppings and sauces.
The food was delicious. One donor wasn't enough for me. The only problem is that it has too much oil (i.e. you need to drink water!)

Nice atmosphere, bit expensive, would come again."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a doner and it won't be my last after eating here! The ordering is very much like Chipotle style in that you choose your protein, protein carrier (E.g. Salad, bread, fries), mix ins and your sauce. The price for beef, chicken, or vegan kisir is the same which I thought would have been a rip off if I were getting the vegan option since kisir sounded like the Turkish equivalent of tabbouleh, made of relatively inexpensive ingredients. I went with the chicken encased in bread, with shredded carrot, cabbage, sumac onion, and shepherd salad (tomatoes, cucumber, dill). I asked for both the haydari (White) and spicy devil sauce (Red). Since everything is already prepped it took only a short amount of time to toast the bread and assemble my meal. The total was a little less than $10 and I was on my way to enjoy my meal at home.

The bread was soft but tough enough to withstand all the different ingredients in the sandwich. It was like a cross between a pita and shepherd's bread. I liked how it was cut part way so that any filling material would be held in the sandwich instead of falling out when you picked it up. 

The doner itself reminded me a lot of the Turkish version of muffaletta, with thinly shaved meat, and various marinated textural condiments in a round sandwich bread.

The blend of meat and vegetables was delicious and I was pretty full after eating the sandwich. 

If you'd like a taste of Turkish fast food this is your place!"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place!! I love döners - used to eat them often, but all the places around here try to sell a gyro as a döner. Not this place!! Authentic, delicious, and such a great price! Big döner, fries, and a water for less than $10?! Yes, please."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Spicy, fresh, and great bread! We will be back .  My friend had a vegetarian salad and I had the Southwest Doner. Yummy"}
{"text":"I don't eat this type of food a lot, but this is definitely the best Mediterranean style sandwich/salad bowl I've ever had in United States. The meat they use to serve is 100% halal and is well seasoned. And all the toppings they use are unique and fresh. 

All the employees here I've encountered are super nice and helpful. The whole place is tidy and clean as well. Very simple decoration but straight to the point. 

They also have tons of small treats and amazing cheesecakes as well. Personally I like their pomegranate cheesecake. 

They also serve espresso coffee and cold brewed coffee with other specialty drinks as well. 

I will definitely make my way back there and have more food and coffee! 

Nice work Döner Dudes!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but was disappointed today that they closed 15 minutes early. The \"Open\" sign was illuminated, but the door was locked and the employees watched me attempt to enter. According to yelp, they are open until 9, maybe posted incorrectly... Thanks!"}
{"text":"So sad... My Aussie wife thought she was getting an Aussie doner kebab. It's not an Aussie doner kebab. It shouldn't be in a pita. It should be in a wrap. No sauce options. Thought we were finally getting a real doner kebab option. Think the closest is still The Kebab Shop in San Diego. :( If you are going to order here, better off doing a build your own beef doner over fries."}
{"text":"Only reason they are getting two stars is because they were nice. I came the first time loved the concept. Tried the food. I couldn't even finish it it was so SALTY. but, it was late and idk just assumed I'd come back a different time and have a better experience. I again spent $25 on meals and again the salt was so bad the food was not edible. We ended up going to Shawarma Paradise. Similar concept and WAYYY better. Easy on the salt guys!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible food experience. Everyone was nice but most important thing, the food, was really bad. Meet tasted odd. It's sad because it's a new place and you think they would serve food at its best. I also found hair in my food :(, but ate it anyway:(."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! I ordered blindly not really knowing what I'd get near closing (coming from a cook it's stellar when I get edible, let alone delicious food anywhere near closing) thru UberEats and I'm HELLA not sorry! It's delicious and I am HOOKED! I got the chicken doner and brownie- super good! Both!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and kosher friendly! They have macaroni and fries for times you want to splurge and also salads for when you want to eat something on the healthier side."}
