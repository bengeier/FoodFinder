{"text":"This small, charming Portuguese restaurant was definitely a nice discovery. We stumbled upon it while in the area, and it was so full that we just had to try it!  We started with their soup, the Caldo Verde (the Portuguese potato and kale soup with chorizo). The soup was flavourful and comforting, the perfect way to start the dinner.  Then, I tried the chicken salad; their chicken was delicious!!! The ambiance was friendly, I would recommended the restaurant to friends & family, will definitely try to go back."}
{"text":"Simple decor, friendly service and great simple food. With a Portuguese style, Braseiro serves up deliciously grilled meats and seafood in paprika red oils. I tried the whole sardines and calamari (not fried! yum). Both were bursting with flavor and the integrity and moisture of the seafood was perfectly encapsulated by their preparations."}
{"text":"Basically: The best chicken I have ever had. This could be in the running for the best restaurant ive ever eaten at taking into account the quality of the food and flavours. A must-try, it will easily become one of your regular places to get good, seemingly home-made food.   The grilled squid appetizer was delicious and fresh. The chicken was perfectly grilled and seasoned. If you like spicy, ask for their spicy oil when you're chicken comes. If you're having desert, have the natas - classic portuguese pastry thats is also grilled and seasoned with cinnamon. to die for.  The good: I normally wouldnt order chicken in a restaurant because chicken is chicken and its usually nothing special...until i ate at Braseiro. Everything we had was nothing short of perfect on all accounts and even more so impressive because it was a Sunday.   Our bill was 60 dollars without tip. We had: 1 appetizer (grilled squid) (10$) 2 main chicken plates (1/4 chicken + fries + green salad)  (10-12$ depending on leg or breast) 1 order of natas (2) (5$) 1 mint tea (3$) half a pitcher of sangria. (14$)  The bad: alcohol is pretty pricey but still not the most expensive I've had. The place is TINY and we hardly got a table on a Sunday night it was sooo busy. Make reservations."}
{"text":"My #2 favorite Portuguese spots.  Seems the smaller the restaurant is the better it is taste wise. Been going to this place for about  years. Not a single complaint! The chicken is charred to perfection.   Ive ordered the bifana sandwich ( pork cutlet) the chicken sandwich, and the whole chicken. Yummy goodness. I almost died and went to heaven... The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 starts its because, last time i went i ordered a whole chicken and asked for spicy, it ended up not being spicy at all :(  This place is so small, and every time i go its packed, therefore I take my order to go. The servers are really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Restaurant honnête. Bon prix. Sélection de vins portugais.  Ambiance agréable. Très petit et chaleureux. À l'exception des sandwichs, les portions sont très grosses.  Je recommanderais pour une soirée bien arrosée à la portugaise. Toutefois, plus cher qu'au Roi du plateau (mais plus beau)."}
{"text":"It's as good if not better than everybody says.  I had the 1/4 chicken with Greek potatos/fries and a salad. The chicken was some of the best I have had in Montreal. Grilled to perfection with the right amount of seasoning and spiciness. So much so that I used the Greek fries to try to relive the flavor. Not that they needed it. They were perfectly fried which I have found to be quite rare when the fries are that large. Seasoning was a nice combination of garlic with a hint of lemon."}
{"text":"I was amazed at how succulent the chicken tasted. The portions were generous , the service...great! I would definitely recommend Braseiro to my friends and family, and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Portuguese restaurant I've ever tried. It's true that the restaurant itself is small, but the service is good, the menu is big, and the food? The food more than makes up for the size of the establishment. It's just amazing.  My favourite thing to have here is the pork, which is moist and has a really unique flavour. But everything I've tried has been a hit, always fresh and cooked fantastically. Their chicken is amazing too, just the right flavour and charred perfectly. If you want to try something different, though, I highly recommend the Bitoque (Portuguese steak), which was really delicious - and came with an egg on top.  All in all, I highly recommend Braseiro if you're in the mood for some delicious Portuguese food!"}
{"text":"Its an ok restaurant, i went for lunch with peoples from work and its a small place. We took 75% of the restaurant ( we had a reservation),  it didn't take time to have our meal and even if its not portugese  fine cuisine  My chacoal cooked chicken was good.  A good restaurant if you're in rush but not for a date.   C'est un bon restaurant , je suis aller lors d'un diner avec des gens du travail.  C'est un petit resto et à 10 personnes nous occupions 75 % du resto ( avec une réservation quand même !)  Le repas est arrivé asser rapidement et même si ce n'est pas de la fine cuisine mon poulet cuit sur charbon de bois était correct.  Bonne place si vous êtes pressé mais pas pour une date."}
{"text":"Définitivement un excellent rapport qualité/prix. Je ne sais pas si c'est moi ou si c'est généralisé mais ce type rôtisserie portugaise n'est jamais super axé sur le service. Au mieux il est correct, générale et il est peu sympathique. Mais franchement...  On s'en fou!!! Car la qualité du poulet servi est tout simplement exceptionnel. Les calmars grillés y sont aussi excellent. Disons qu'on y va pour la bouffe est pas du tout pour le service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Super friendly service and amazing food! I ordered the quarter chicken and substituted veggies for the fries, I honestly couldn't be happier.  I'd give them six stars if I could... Keep up the great work, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came in without a reservation with 4 available 2 seat tables at around 8 PM on a Saturday night. Waiters needed to confer between themselves (there was a huddle) and then opted to allow us to have a table. Yey! We were then consequently given the table directly near the door and with fall coming along, we preferred to sit somewhere further away from the door. There was a table mere feet away that was more sheltered but the seating arrangement wasn't negotiable since there was \"a reservation\".   Ok. Did they reserve that specific 2 seat table to their patron or something? Same seating arrangement, isn't our money just as important as theirs? We weren't very impressed by this but we ended up sitting down and placing our orders anyways.  Since it was our first visit here we decided to go with their mixed meat plate but apparently try don't serve plates that are shareable and expected us to grab another plate. We shrugged and went with another identical plate since we really wanted to try the variety of meats they had to offer.  When the plates came they were actually pretty big and I couldn't understand why they couldn't have a shareable mixed meat plate like so many other resto seem completely able to do without issues. We ended up with so much salad & rice it was just wasteful..People tend to regularly share plates, especially in a community setting.  ....maybe I'm difficult but whatever.  Regarding the food, it was pretty good. The chicken was excellent as you'd normally expect a Portuguese resto to serve. The pork & beef was quite tasty. I however felt the chorizo was underwhelming in contrast to the other meats.  The service was alright, food & drinks were served in a timely fashion and refills were done without a problem.  Ultimately, we felt we paid more than we should have for what we ate. Perhaps seeing 2 plates with identical 1/3 of it leftover with so much salad & rice left me a little resentful when I paid the bill.  Finally......when we finished paying I went out of my way to point out at the empty table we weren't allowed to use..... which sat empty beside us during the 1+ hour meal we just experienced.  Shenanigans. Truly.  With so many Portuguese options I don't wouldn't see myself here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"J'ai souvent commandé pour emporter à ce restaurant et j'ai toujours été heureux de voir qu'il y avait toujours une bonne quantité et que la qualité était bonne. Ce soir, je suis passé au restaurant pour manger sur place et je constate que le service est très bon, comme ce l'est habituellement dans les rôtisseries portugaises. Le restaurant était plein pour un mercredi soir, dans une ambiance de quartier. Je n'hésiterais pas à revenir."}
{"text":"It was the first time I had Portuguese food so have nothing to compare it to, but the chicken was delicious. I liked the little kick of spice it had and was not overpowering.   Tip would be finish the food while you're there because the chicken becomes dry when reheated.   I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Sitting inside the restaurant right now and I am so in awww of how come I have never thought of coming here before. I have passed by this place so many times but never thought of trying it out. What a mistake that was!!!! Braseiro has taken chicken to a whole new level. I had the quarter chicken leg, it was juicy, grilled on charcoal, it had that charcoali taste. It came with a side of fries and salad. The fries still had the skin on it, which made it even better. The food was fresh, the staff is very nice and friendly. Deserts are as good as the food itself. Coffee was excellent. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. Prices are very good, portions are reasonable."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Portuguese food, you can find it at Braseiro! Their menu is a mix of portuguese plates between chicken, steak, and fish. I personally go there for their chicken! There spicy sauce is delicious and is a must try when ordering the chicken.  Be sure to reserve a table, as it gets busy on evenings. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a nice, cosy restaurant to celebrate a birthday, occassion, or a get together. :)"}
{"text":"Always great food here! Service is good and quick. The restaurant is small and cozy. I love there spicy sauce for the chicken. One of my favorite Portuguese restaurant."}
{"text":"The cheese, the olives, the chicken, the dessert, all of it was amazing. So sad I didn't get photos. The only downside is that the dining area is small so eating in may be difficult without a reservation."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce petit resto sous la recommandation d'une amie, et quelle délicieuse découverte dans le quartier Villeray ! L'assiette de pieuvre et calmars grillés était sublime : les fruits de mer étaient tendres et savoureux ! Grillades bien exécutées, salade fraîche et croquante, un bel accompagnement de légumes grillés... Les portions sont généreuses, bon rapport qualité/prix pour des fruits de mer. Le resto est petit, mais l'ambiance est agréable.  Ils projettent des événements sportifs sur télé (avis aux fans de hockey !) Il est recommandé de réserver."}
{"text":"Happen to come across this place during my lunch break . I came here a year ago never finish my review I took a mixed plate than it was really good now I went for the rib streak that came with a  potato soup I liked the soup the steak I asked for a medium rare it's what I got and it was really good the chef was on his game today. I think it worth checking out for sure maybe during lunch time where it's not super packed. I'll warn you some plates will cost a lot and it doest look really fancy inside but the food so far is was great."}
