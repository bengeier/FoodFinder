it's not shit
it's aiiiiight

actually the creme of cauliflower was pretty gud"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite place for Japanese style pasta. But for a period of time, their standards slipped a bit. For a while, their food had been hit or miss, service slacked. We stopped going until last week. 

They have a brand new lunch menu, which is quite exciting. There's a whole page of new items on top of the familiar pastas they've got. We tried some of the new items. 2 of them were outstanding! The Unagi Tamago Dashi Rice was absolutely delicious! The egg with the dashi sauce on top of the rice goes nicely with the unagi. The Yaki Udon is the best I've had so far. I never liked yaki udon. Most of the time the noodles are tasteless. Not the ones here. It has a nice sauce, in which the udon full absorbed the taste, and the dish was serve covered with bonito flakes, seaweed and green onion. Not to mention lots of pork slices fried with the noodles. 

We had a large group, so we also ordered other dishes. The pastas were as good as before and the Banana Crepes was what I remembered. 

Service is good. Maybe still not back to their old standard. But improved from their low time. 

We can see that they made a great effort to come back, and they did a good job. 

Will keep an eye to see if they can keep it up."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! 

Ordered: 
Nori fries
- excellent, crispy, flavourful, not too salty, not too heavy, lots of nori!

Earl Grey tea

Shrimp okonomiyaki
- perfectly cooked spaghetti with caramelized onions, bacon, shrimp, and okonomiyaki sauces 
- very delicious

Black sesame crème brulée
- crispy top, smooth custard, and lots of black sesame on the bottom! 

The staff was very nice, though at times frazzled. The setting of the restaurant is very relaxed/casual with jazz in the background. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a great fusion restaurant in J-town.  The ambience of the restaurant is very nice and we had great service. They also play a great jazz soundtrack in the background.

We ordered the Japanese poutine to share as an appetizer and had 2 pasta dishes for the entree.  They cooked their pasta a perfect al dente and both dishes tasted very good."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to try Japanese style of pasta. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I found our dishes too salty! (Please note, this was in october 2012). He said his stomach didn't feel too good after eating the eel-pasta. I had no problem though! Service is a little slow at dinner time so I will try to go earlier next time.  On a positive note, the girl who took our orders was really nice and happy! And I really love their fries! Probably one of the best and freshest, meaty but skinny fries I've had! Again, I would ask next time for less salt on everything. That's my biggest issue :("}
{"text":"4-stars for the epic Japanese poutines.  -1 star for the ugly decor. The pasta is alright too."}
{"text":"Eel spaghetti is nice. Noodles are really creamy and eels tastes really nice. Clam spaghetti is a bit disappointed and not really worth the money tho. Clam taste dry and noodles lacks sauce and really dry. 

Okonoyako fries were the only dish my friends all enjoy."}
{"text":"I do like their Al dente pasta.  Unagi don pasta sauce was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! A friend told me about this place last summer and I can't stay away. The Okonomiyaki fries are my absolute favourite. It's kind of odd that a Japanese fusion place serves pasta, but I'm a big fan. I also love their desserts - black sesame creme brulee!"}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered the okonomiyaki fries as appetizer, unagi-don pasta and sukiyaki pasta for main dish and green tea red bean cake for desert. The okonomiyaki fries were amazing. The okonomiyaki sauce made a good combination with the crunchy fries. The pastas were ok. The sauce was little bit too sweet for me, but I guess that's how wafu style tasted like. :P And the cake was good. The cream was rich and the red bean goes so well with green tea as always."}
{"text":"Before I loved ordering the salmon pasta with vodka sauce, it was very tasty and saucy.

However, I went recently and the pasta was veryy dry because it didn't have enough sauce. It was very bland with minimal sauce. Not sure if they are trying to cheap out with some ingredients."}
{"text":"Its a small place, but actually quite nice. Its in the J town plaza. Its got a small menu, but the dishes are actually VERY good. The pasta dishes are better than most italian restaurants. They have a japanese twist on pasta dishes. I enjoyed this place very much. Service was surprisingly good. 

Im not sure why its not a 5 star, it just isnt."}
{"text":"First time a full plate of fries got devoured.

The okomiyaki fries were delicious and same with the shrimp okomiyaki spaghetti.  However, the two together may be too much.  The seasonings and sauces are addictive but would not recommend to someone who eats healthy.  It tastes exactly as you would imagine, okomimyaki seasoning on fries and spaghetti but simply delicious."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Shiso Tree Cafe from a friend, I was skeptical at first. I thought, \"Japanese and Italian... sashimi + tomato pasta = what\". I gave it a try since reviews were quite high and I have trouble turning down trying new food.

We had a nice gentleman as our server who answered all my questions about what kind of sauce the pasta came with, or what each Japanese word meant, and he had no complaints or seemed even the least frustrated with me. Along with that, he came over to our table a reasonable amount to ask if we wanted water refills. Overall, I would say service was 10/10.

The environment was nice and comfortable as well; I didn't feel out of place at all :). The cafe is located at Jtown, and seemed to catch the attention of anime and cosplay fans.

So as an appetizer we ended up ordering the okonomiyaki fries as an appetizer. The flavour was great at the beginning, but by the time a quarter of the fries were left, there wasn't enough sauce for my liking. That's about the only negative comment I have about these babies. Overall, I'd say $8 was a great price for that huge plate of yummy goodness!

For the entree my boyfriend got the shrimp okonomiyaki wafu pasta. It tasted very much like the fries. I thought it was full of flavour, and I really enjoyed how the noodles had a crispy touch to them. However, my boyfriend thought the flavour was lacking. We both really enjoyed the shrimp though. The pasta came with a slice of garlic bread which was nice. For the price, I'd say these guys were worth it :).

I got the season special which was the wafu seafood pasta. It had squid, clam, and shrimp in shoyu and dashi sauce (soy sauce and Japanese soup stock). I personally did not like this dish. Probably because I don't like clams... Haha, it was my fault for ordering a dish where the main ingredient is clams -_-. I thought the flavour was lacking too. On the upside, THE SQUID WAS FANTASTIC. It was so nice, chewy, and soft! It was very nice on its own, but it didn't taste very good with the noodles. I for one really, really, REALLY enjoy shrimp, but this shrimp was mediocre. The flavouring from the soup/sauce didn't collaborate well with the shrimp. I will honestly say that this dish was disappointing, but I'm more than certain that a clam lover would enjoy this much more than I did.

All in all, I'd rate Shiso Tree Cafe 9/10!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come back here every few months. The food was still good. We tried a new special today- the breaded deep fried oysters with 2 types of dipping sauce. The oysters were well cooked and the size was petty good. We liked the spicy sauce better than the tar tar sauce. Hubby had the napolitan and I had the arrabiatta. Pastas were good and flavourful as usual. Service was good at the beginning but became slower as the meal went on."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places. The lunch deal is my favourite - perfect portion size, and a little bit of everything (soup, salad, pasta, bread) for $8. It's a cozy ambiance and a the wait staff are generally on top of things.

The new menu is interesting. Apparently \"pork belly\" is bacon (or at least it looked and tasted like it). Tasty, but it's definitely not pork belly."}
{"text":"Big portions, quality and taste is alright.. Not worth the price though
Inside looks good, service is good
I recommend the eel pasta they have its really good
If you're planning to get the fries, its very filling, share it with a few people"}
{"text":"Not from Toronto and I was looking forward to this restaurant with the Japanese flavoured pasta. We ordered the okonomiyaki fries which was quite good. However the pastas weren't what I have expected. It did not taste as good as I thought and it was quite a heavy meal to finish it."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner. 

We ordered the nori fries to share. It was surprisingly delicious. The fries were perfectly crispy and had this interesting Japanese dressing that had a sweet yet savoury quality to it. Topped with the nori - delicious! The dish is large - personally I think it's best shared with a group of 4. 

We ordered the unagi don and the shrimp okonomiyaki. The okonomiyaki pasta was quite oily actually. I think I would have preferred the unagi don which came with 2 large pieces of grilled eel and the pasta was cooked in a creamy sauce. 

Service was super fast and efficient. 

Overall we enjoyed shiso tree cafe. The prices comparable to typical western restaurants. We would come back to try their desserts in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to shiso tree twice. It would have only been one time but I wanted my boyfriend to try it out since we've never been to a place like that together before. 

Both times I ordered the same things.

Fries with nori and tartar sauce (sauce on the side).
Fries with bloegnese sauce.
Smoked salmon pasta with the cream sauce (not the rose sauce).

The first time the tartar sauce was so yummmy! The second time was way too oniony for my liking. The bloegnese sauce one have to be the one I like most but it's not something I'd crave.

The lunch special serving is tiny tiny. But it filled me and it comes with a piece of garlic toast so...It was okay. The first time was really under seasoned. I added salt. When I went with the boyfriend, we only ordered one pasta (regular size) and it was better.

The food takes a while to come out. Both times haven't been that busy and it still took almost half an hour to get our food.

Two times is enough for me. If I go again, it won't be my idea.

Try if you'd like."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  If you have kids do not come to this restaurant. The service is horrible. They do not allow you to bring food from outside the restaurant even for your children. It's not like we are not ordering so why be a prick about it?  We're talking about a 5 year old child with special dietary needs for goodness sake!  And this is coming from the owner himself who obvious doesn't have any children.  

Our daughter just had a tooth pulled out and 3 cavity fillings done recently and require soft food so we brought a small bowl of home cooked porridge with chopped veggies in case she wasn't able to eat what they had at this restaurant.  And the owner had the nerve to demand that she should have eaten this at home before coming to the restaurant.  He has no idea how ridiculous he sounded in front of everyone.

We are very disappointed.  These people are rude and discriminatory.  I will never return again."}
{"text":"Food wise, I would give it a 3.5 star rating but the service was great pushing it to 4 star.  Went a few weeks ago on a Saturday night, had wanted to try the Japanese style pasta for a while.  Place was more spacious than I expected and had a nice relaxed feel to it.  

Ordered the Shrimp Okonomiyaki Pasta (big fan of okonomiyaki!) and added $8 for the combo which includes a soup and dessert.  The pasta comes with a salad and garlic bread which weren't too exciting tho'.  

Soup:  potato soup, not as thick as you'd expect but I think it was intentional since it was served in a mug which was interesting.  Taste was ok.

Pasta:  Al dente spaghetti, shrimps were well cooked, flavour was ok however it needed more sauce/flavouring.  

Dessert:  choice of different cakes, I had the green tea red bean cake (yum!).  Flavour and texture were good but I think the cream could use a little more green tea. 

Price: average.

Overall, meal was enjoyable!  Will return to try other items like okonomiyaki fries!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with delicious and filling Japanese inspired pastas. I prefer the lighter broth based pastas like the shoyu mushroom rather than the heavier creme based ones. Good price, good food, and attentive staff. I'll definitely frequent this resto more!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip. Enjoyed the music that was played in the background, great customer service and everyone needs to try the Okonomiyaki fries!"}
{"text":"Been to Jtown a handful of times but never noticed Shiso until today.  The decor and layout of the restaurant was very different and unique in a nice way.  Spacious yet cozy in the dining area.  Like most have already mentioned, friendly and attentive service.

The menu was simple but somehow I felt the dishes were all over the place and had a tough time narrowing down to what I didn't want to try.  Call me picky but nothing really fit my appetite.  I ordered the Salmon Rose pasta.  The sauce and salmon was well prepared but I found the pasta a little tough to chew on.  My friend order their fries with seaweed; that was surprisingly good!  Would totally recommend it; be warn though, it comes in a huge bowl good enough for at least 4 ppl.

Restaurant becomes really busy at peak hours but we were not rushed at all.  Very customer service oriented.  Five stars for service but the food and value sort of dragged the rating to a three stars for me.  Maybe on my next visit I might try their desserts and bump the rating to a four star.  From all the pictures posted, I gather that their dessert should be amazing!"}
{"text":"I always ordered Taiyako or okonomiyaki pasta. The flavors are delightful. The pasta is always cooked right. It is pricey but I wont mind going there from time to time."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday hoping to bring a good experience for my friend that was visiting Markham. We ordered the Okonomiyaki fries, Sukiyaki pasta and the Shrimp okonomiyaki. All was well and my friend was impressed with the food, until a cockroach popped out on the side of the wall !! It was gross, and all the waitresses were too scared to catch it. We were legit waiting there for 10 mins with our food waiting for them to catch it. I finally suggested that we move and ate in peace. Prob need a health inspection for this...so eat at your own risk! haha"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Japanese-style pasta, this is the place. Their pasta was al dente and the different sauces were unique and refreshing with a hint of shiso. 

The nori fries were yummy but could be crispier. Highly recommend the unagi and okonomiyaki pastas."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Very unique.. not your typical Japanese food (No Sushi here)

Have yet to find another restaurant like this. Only thing is some of the sauce is a little too salty.. mostly the soya sauce based pastas."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated but not exactly fancy ... it has a casual feel. When we got there (around 12:30) it was mostly empty except for a couple business dudes finishing their meal at a nearby table.

For $8 at lunch you get salad, soup, and the main course (pasta). For that price, it was definitely worth it. The salad was standard lettuce and dressing, the soup was a bisque. Both were decent. I had the salmon pasta and my friend had the one with bacon. Both were good and it was just enough food for us both to be satisfied without feeling super full and bloated. :)

Our server was attentive and helpful throughout our meal. The only negatives were that the Japanese influence on the Italian food was rather slight (it seemed like mostly Italian food with a slight Japanese twist) and nothing really stood out as being spectacular. However it was a comfortable experience for lunch and I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area and want a cheap and casual lunch place."}
{"text":"This is one of the small restaurants at J-Town.  I came here twice, once for the $8 lunch menu and another time for desserts with my friends.  
I would say it's an \"ok\" place.  I had the Neopolitan pasta+soup lunch combo. The taste is good.. can't complain for $8 but I just feel that it's not a very balanced meal, lots of carb and not much of veggie or meat.  
Dessert is pretty good.  I'd say it's a great place for friend gatherings, to chill and to chat."}
{"text":"I am actually a regular customer since back in 2011. The food is good, and they maintained it pretty well. The lunch special during weekdays is definitely a good value and give just enough portion. But, the worst thing... this place is no longer a child-friendly restaurant!  I have a 20 months old toddler, and the server/owner told us that we cannot bring outside food, even for a toddler! the server mentioned about health and safety issues, which is understandable, if I bring outside food for adult. But, come on! This is the food for a toddler."}
{"text":"Good food but wait staff sometimes have trouble understanding special dietary instructions (i.e. lactose, vegan, etc) their takoyaki fries are really good!"}
{"text":"Visited Shiso Tree Cafe for the first time on Sunday. I wasn't blown away by the food ~ it was quite mediocre. I ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki pasta which came with salad and garlic bread.The salad was a good appetizer ~ I loved the dressing.  For the pasta, I liked the way the noodles were cooked al dente but I found that the homemade steak sauce made the dish way too sweet for my liking. I kept tasting it in my mouth for the next couple of hours and felt a little nauseous from it. I'm def not a fan of sweet pasta. The \"garlic bread\" was rather sad ~ half a slice of regular white bread with some garlic butter on it. I didn't feel that it was worth the $14. 

The service was exceptionally slow that day. It took long to take our orders, and also very long for our food to come out for our group of 8 people. Our food came out all at different times ~ of course this is inevitable to some extent, but when some people are finishing their dishes before others have received theirs, that's a problem in my books. Also did not appreciate that they waited until the end of our meal to tell us that the debit machine was down and then suggest that we use the atm nearby ~ extra charges for what I thought was already overpriced food!  

The interior was ok ~ kind of trendy, but nothing spectacular. While we were there, the roof sprung a leak and my friend who was standing under it had some drops land on her head. 

I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Service here is great and I really enjoyed eating here because they were actually Japanese people.  Food is okay, I expected a little bit more out of the spaghetti."}
{"text":"I loved it when I went several years ago, but I went back last week and it wasn't as good as  I initially thought. I ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki  pasta and it was a lot dryer than I remembered, so I was very disappointed.

Service could have been more attentive. They didn't come to refill our water, so we had to grab the jug and helped ourselves. Our waitress also seemed to have limited English as she was confused when we asked her to take a group photo for us. She was very friendly though.

I don't think I'd return, since there are many restaurants in the area that are better at the same price point."}
{"text":"I love their home-made fries.Their Lunch menus are great."}
{"text":"Mmmm.. So good. It's strange to see a fusion of such distinct cuisines but it works so well here. Of course, you have to get their notorious nori fries. Delicious but be careful as tiny black specks might stick all over your teeth, face and clothes! I was going to laugh at my boyfriend for his messy eating but as I ran my tongue over my teeth, I realized the same had happened to me. They're really generous with the nori! Ask for a bit of mayo with your fries (if you're about that) because it will take it to another level.

The sukiyaki pasta is tasty but the carbonara was better. Can't go wrong with something simple containing bacon! The side of garlic bread was simply not good but that's okay. Their friendly service makes up for it. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"A simple yet nice place.
Food tasted great. I went for the lunch specials where you get a soup, salad and pasta for less than 10 bucks!
I also shared okonomiyaki fries with a friend, but it was SO BIG. and delicious.
Service was great!
Recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"OKAY can I just say that this is my favourite place for lunch when I'm craving French fries......their Nori Fries are sooo taste, crunchy and full of flavour! I am a big fan of their Tar Tar Fries as well however I feel they just load up the tar tar and the fries end up getting soak in mayo =( ....definitely a must try place!"}
{"text":"This cafe is lacking in atmosphere. Price isn't the issue here, it's letting down your customers. For the amount that you're paying, and considering that it's empty most days, there's no reason why the server can't be more attentive. 

Upon my recent visit:

- Server was busy behind the counter, probably playing on her phone.
- Our drinks were not refilled on a timely manner. This is just the easiest way to piss off a customer.
- Despite this being in JTown, the server didn't provide a warm and welcoming feel to her approach, unlike the cashiers across the building who made the experience much more authentic. 
- Food was mediocre, and this is a generous comment"}

More so recently I've been really obessed with making Japanese fusion Spaghetti at home. These recipes usually consist of some type of meat or seafood, Japanese mayo or soy sauce.. let your imagination go wild!
You probably tried something similar to this at various Izakayas- for example, Guu serves Carbonara Udon with bacon, onions and poached egg on top.

So I've heard of good things about Shiso Tree Cafe at J Town and decided to check it out for lunch with my family on the weekend.

Parking is pretty easy here, you just find a spot inside the plaza and you are good to go.

Restaurant itself isn't that big so if you don't want to wait, I would suggest arriving a little early.
Thankfully, we got the last table that was avail and then line-ups started around the door.

Shiso Tree Cafe served other appetizers but Japanese fusion pasta is what they specialize in so you want to get that for sure. 
The price varies from $10~22 and they all come with salad and garlic bread on the side.

Ordered: Uni Tagliolini 4/5

* Cream sauce using fresh Vancouver sea urchin roe (uni) with house made fresh pasta for $22
* Keep in mind that this is seasonal as long as uni is in season
* My mom loves uni so she decided to get this, note that this is probably the most expensive pasta off their menu
* I was expecting more of a creamy sauce, but you can def taste uni in the sauce
* This did take a while to come so be patient

Ordered: Shiso Clam Vongole 3.5/5

* White wine, olive oil, garlic, bacon, tomato, fresh manila clams and shiso for $15
* This was just like your ordinary clam vongole that can be found at Italian restaurants
* There weren't that many clams and the ones that did exist were quite small 
* I found it to be a litle too bland and didn't think it was anything special

Ordered: Shrimp Okonomiyaki 5/5

* Spaghetti sauteed with bacon, onions and garlic dressed with shrimp, homemade steak sauce, Japanese mayo and bonito fish flakes for $14
* This was the dish I ordered and I really enjoyed every bit of this
* It is somewhat on the heavier side of spaghetti with mayo and steak sauce 
* Every component of this pasta worked well with each other
* I would def get this again or recommend it to others

Summary: Nice quick lunch spot in J-Town if you love Japanese fusion dishes or want to try something new. They have specials that change throughout season so check it out!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place.  Something new and different, but was disappointed.  We ordered the niro fries, niro salad and shrimp pasta dish.  There no WOW factor to any of the dishes.  We found everything kinda of tasted the same.

The saving grace was the service.  The staff was very tentative.

I will not be returning.  Pasta with a Japanese fusion is just not my taste."}
{"text":"Their poutine / fries are so good! However, all the pasta dishes are rather flavourless and disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give Shiso Tree a less than favourable review - especially given how highly regarded this cafe was a few years ago. We arrived at little before 4 PM and walked into the restaurant to be seated... only to be told by the server that the restaurant was \"closed\". What? Closed? How could this be? I mean - there were 3 other tables munching away at their food. Upon asking and confirming with the waitress again if the restaurant was indeed closed, we decided to take the L and left the restaurant. 
We hangrily stood in front of the restaurant to discuss what our next plan of action was. A group of about 5 people walked into the restaurant. Me and my friend knew that they were going to be turned away, just like we were. NOPE! They were seated immediately. What the hell? I stormed back inside and asked what the deal was. There was a different waitress this time, and she said \"we're not closed - we start dinner service in 15 minutes\". WHY DID THE OTHER WAITRESS TELL US THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS FREAKING CLOSED. We would've been perfectly fine with waiting! If it weren't for that group that went into the cafe, we would've left J-Town and went to another restaurant. There definitely needs to be better signage regarding their hours of operation. What a bitter memory. 

Now for the food - the okonomiyaki fries were pretty good, though, on the salty side (too many of those bonito flakes). Pastas were meh, but were indeed creative with a Japanese twist. 

If it weren't for that initial blunder, we would've had a better overall experience."}
{"text":"My brother couldn't stop raving about the delicious Nori Fries at Shiso Tree Café. That's when I decided it was somewhere I needed to visit. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night and it was completely packed with hungry patrons. We were really surprised by the prices on the menu as all the dishes seemed very reasonably priced. We may have gone overboard ordering 6 items on the menu.

We ordered the famous Nori Fries (Tossed with homemade wafu dressing and Japanese seaweed) and the Okonomiyaki Fries (Dressed with homemade steak sauce, Japanese mayo, bonito fish flakes and green onions). Both were huge portions which we were not expecting. By the time we got half way through the fries, we realized how much food it actually was. I preferred the Okonomiyaki Fries over the Nori Fries because of the steak sauce. Don't expect the steak sauce to taste like A1 or HP sauce. It's more of a sweet sauce and it doesn't have the strong tang flavor of western steak sauces.

As for the entrees, we got a pasta dish for the boyfriend and the Smoked Salmon a la Crème Vodka (Vodka based cream sauce with smoked salmon and fresh dill. Garnished with ikura (salmon roe) and caviar) for me. I adore salmon and I'm not a huge fan of tomato sauces so it was a clear choice when I looked through the menu of pastas. It was a great surprise as the pasta dish wasn't super heavy and the saltiness of the salmon worked perfectly with the cream sauce.

Even though we were stuffed, I wanted to get something for dessert to end off the night. For dessert we ordered the Toasted Walnut tea (Japanese green tea with toasted walnuts, pineapple, coconut and almond) and the Azuki Matcha Crème Toast (Buttered toast with Japanese red bean, vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream drizzled with green tea crème sauce). The toast was absolutely amazing. I could have just had 4 plates of the dessert. The combination of red bean and green tea has always been one of my favourites but paired with the ice cream and toast as a vessel, it was fantastic.

I'm positive that I'll be back to Shiso Tree Café but perhaps next time, we don't order as much as we did... unless of course, it's the Azuki Matcha Crème Toast."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday night with big expectations of tasting some pasta as good as Mario Batali's Babbo (as some other reviewers mentioned elsewhere), but was disappointed.  Started with the Nori Fries which weren't very crispy and was quite saturated with oil.  Normally my kids love seaweed or fries by themselves, but they couldn't tolerate these fries (even with ketchup on the side, they wouldn't touch it).  The fish soup special was just ok, as least they gave you enough seafood and the broth was decent.  Pasta came and we had the shrimp okonomiyaki (a bit too sweet for my liking), uni pasta (rather boring after the first 1-2 bites as it's the exact same flavour and texture in the entire plate) and bolognese with bacon and sausage pasta (again quite oily).  While the pasta was cooked al dente, it was the exact same spaghetti in all 3 pasta dishes we ordered, and the meal got boring very quickly.  Service was good but the place wasn't even half full.  Overall I was disappointed, probably won't be back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious Japanese-Italian fusion cuisine, Shiso Tree Cafe is the place!

Tucked away in J-Town, this tiny cafe is cozy yet gives you ample space between each table. The servers are extremely friendly and speedy - our water cups will filled at all times. 

Their specials are posted on the walls, so be sure to check it out before you order. I opted for the Unagi-Don pasta ($17) - comes with their house salad. It was deeeeee-licious! The pasta was cooked to perfection and seaweed and eel complemented the creamy sauce - It's what heaven tastes like! 

I will be coming back here in the future for sure! Unlike other Japanese-owned restaurants, they're open on Sundays! Next on my check list - their Japanese poutine!"}
{"text":"Okonomiyami fries were delicious! The server was very friendly and she did everything to make us comfortable. The food took forever though and it certainly didn't help that I was in a rush. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"My experience at Shiso has been ?consistent every time I've been here. The Japanese poutine wa?s a bit too salty for me near the bottom, but overall it was quite enjoyable. The ?shrimp cream of corn pasta is usually my go-to. I'd recommend this if you prefer a slight sweetness in your pasta. However,? I wouldn't recommend the smoked salmon rosé because the salmon tasted fishy. The servers are friendly, but they are not very attentive and will take some effort to flag down."}
{"text":"This place is a quick mom and pop shop.. or as they call a cafe that sells ramen and other dishes... really doesn't suit the name.

But their service is great. They have great coffee for a decent price. The environment is clean.

Unfortunately this restaurant is not easy to find. It's in the back of the crammed jtown plaza. Pay close attention to the hours of operation as they are closed during odd hours in the day. You could be stuck stranded without food. They are next to another ramen shop, but still why would they need back to back ramen shops?

The place is deserted during the day.

Overall, not bad of a place. Could be better."}
{"text":"FINALLY found a place that makes good pasta! Although, it takes a while for food to come out because they seem to be short on staff and because the manager there tends to take on too many responsibilities. O.o  He was the only one seating people, taking orders, and giving/receiving the bills- in addition to serving drinks and food. In turn, he ended up getting super stressed and getting a bit agitated with customers. Despite that, I'd still return because the food was awesome and service overall was good. Saw a 'hiring' sign then, so service should be improving."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside J-Town, at first glance it is easy to miss, but I was excited to try this place based on reviews from Yelp! I was extremely impressed. It kind of gives off a nice, small cafe feeling with a lot of unique and interesting menu choices. It is a fusion of Italian and Japanese cuisine, mixing together pasta with Japanese-inspired dishes/spices. 

I ordered the Okonomiyaki pasta and my boyfriend ordered the Carbonara pasta, both under $15 (I think it was $12 and $11 respectively). Seriously, I can't even get REGULAR pasta (spaghetti & meat balls) at a generic Westernized restaurant, let alone a specialty one. The wait time was a big long but the taste was decadent! Portions were good (not gourmet yet not a huge chunk of pasta to make you bloated) and came with a small slice of garlic bread.

It was an interesting experience to be eating something that TASTES like okonomiyaki but is deconstructed into a pasta. They are very intricate with their pasta and it seems like all the pasta is made fresh! Carbonara pasta was also good, wanted to try it because it was reminiscent of Guu (never did I think creamy bacon goodness would go so well with Japanese spices)

I think in general: atmosphere, creative concept in fusing the best of these 2 cuisines, and reasonable prices to try something new and tasty are solid reasons why I would definitely come back and highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Fusion pasta in J-town with pasta sets and cake from the bakery next door.

Decent price and unique Japanese fusion flavours not found anywhere else.

All pastas come with a house salad. The size of the house salad has decreased significantly in quantity then when the restaurant first opened. Probably no more than 2 bites.

Soup is always a sure bet. Served warm in a mug with croutons. Can range from clam chower, bacon potato soup to tomato bisque. Always something to look forward to.

The pasta dishes haven't changed much over the years. I prefer the shrimp okonomiyaki, shrimp cream of corn, fettucine rose, and the unagi don. The shimeji shoyu and sukiyaki beef comes in a more liquidy broth than usual. The pasta is always al dente with a good ratio of sauce to meat.

Have Japanese inspired fries - nori fries, Japanese poutine, and okonomiyaki flavour. The portions are great to share, but with the pasta itself and the slice of toast, might be too much for the general appetite.

You can add soup to your pasta or a pasta set, which includes soup and cake.

Great place for eating out for a nice meal - call ahead to reserve a seat!

{"text":"I ended up at the Shisho Tree Cafe with a group of girlfriends for a quick dinner on a Sunday night. I've never been here before (or even in j-town, for that matter) and am generally still quite ignorant when it comes to Japanese-Italian fusion.

I am, however, totally excited about this place!

The restaurant itself is tucked away, but the inside is welcoming, with a warm furniture set-up and intimate feel. 

Our server was polite and attentive, although I think we had a little bit of trouble communicating at first (she seemed unsure about what I meant when I asked if a meal could be prepared without bacon -- this in turn made ME a little nervous!)

We ended up getting two orders of fries (definitely a sharable portion!): the nori and the ogonomiyaki. Both were tasty, although I preferred the Japanese mayo slightly more. What can I say...I'm a sucker for fries slathered in creamy goodness.

I got the ogonomiyaki spaghetti (witout bacon) and it was delicious - perfectly cooked pasta and just the right amount of sauce. 

The menu is not huge, but there are some good options on there. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying out some of the other dishes. A few people around us had some tasty looking shrimp plates so that's definitely next for me."}
{"text":"I've been to Shiso Tree a few times and I usually enjoy eating here. The service is attentive but unobtrusive. Always filling the glass of water that I keep downing. The food is fusion, a mix of Japanese flavours in italian styles. The Pastas are pretty good, I find their spaghetti is a good texture and never overdone. 

Nori Fries: a must try, it a great shareable. 

Shrimp Okonomiyaki: There are about 4 shrimps, and it is quite tasty. I personally like the sukiyaki more than this one. If you like okonomiyaki flavours you would like this. That is mayo, seaweed and teriyaki sauce flavours. ($14)

Sukiyaki: this is a beef pasta. I usually order this because the flavours are more harmonious in my mind. I always like beef sukiyaki so add carbs to it and it will win me over everytime. ($15) 


Will be back."}
{"text":"Boy things have changed here and it could be just the day we went (Sunday afternoon = busy, busy, busy). I'll chalk it up to a one-time experience, but it has left a bad taste.

First, the restaurant on Sunday opens at 12 and we had reservations for 13 people right at 12. We went in 11:55 and were told the restaurant was closed which meant we couldn't just sit for 5 minutes and had to go back out in the cold. So, just be warned, don't come right before the restaurant opens. When we came in at 12:01, our tables weren't even set up so there was a bit of a mix up and other people sat in our area. Of course they are not going to take this 5 minutes to set up for us.

Second. The way Shiso Tree works is that there is a menu, but there are always specials posted on blackboards. Because we were a group of more than 12, we could only order our mains from this piece of paper (menu just for larger groups) which had like 5-6 pasta dishes. You could order from the special's board and you could also order appetizers and salads from the main menu...just not the main section. I was also the only person from my table that ordered from the main menu and they wouldn't make an exception which well, totally within their right, but ugh...I get it if we all ordered and it would take the kitchen some time, but one dish for one person? Also, we have been there before with larger groups and never had this restriction on us. 

Third. There are only 3 staff members for a packed restaurant so service is prompt meaning you get your orders taken, food brought and maybe cleared (you have to remind them) and they plunk a big pitcher of water for self-pour.

I am sad to say I didn't have the best experience...I remember when this place first opened, we had these two great waitresses (older ladies) and even the manager (?) who would pour generous glasses of wine and treat us like family. But now, it's become a typical Chinese-Congee-Queen-in-and-out experience. Needless to say, reservations are required.

Food is still good: pasta cooked al-dente with that perfect bounce-bite and the Japanese-Italian fusion works well. So, each gets a star."}
{"text":"They take reservations! Got to sit in the cute booth by the window, but you have to take off your shoes.

Smoked Salmon on garlic toast appetizer was yummy, as well as the smoked salmon salad. Also got the Okonomiyaki Fries... really nothing special... Definitely lacked a LOT more sauce. Very dry with all the dry seasonings.

Onto the Entrees:
Fettucini Rose with snow crab and ikura was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good amount of crab meat and the sauce had a very rich, deep, crab flavour.By far the best entree we ordered.

Sukiyaki pasta tastes a bit like beef ramen. It was tasty, but TOO SALTY unfortunately.

Lastly, my other two friends got the Carbonara and the Smoked Salmon alla vodka, and both cream sauces were EXTREMELY BLAND and not palatable. Would not recommend these dishes.

Overall, it's a really interesting concept having pasta with a Japanese flavour. Worth a try, but don't go in with too high expectations!"}
{"text":"Ambience and food are great,waitress are friendly and smile all the time,but the waiter seems not in a good mood,no smile and somehow created a intense mood when I was asking about details for the dish"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp and was really drawn by the very interesting pictures posted and the japanized take on things I like such as fries and pasta. 

The nori fries were actually pretty good. Better than I expected. Crispy despite being apparently coated in some sauce. The clam pasta was cooked perfectly al dente but nothing really special for the price its at. The smoked salmon appetizer needed improvement such the ratio of salmon to bread was way outta whack (too much bread!).

I like this place because it is unique. A very tiny bit overpriced. But overall it has decent food it is a good place to go to. I'd recommend it for sure to be tried at least once."}
{"text":"Portion sizes seem a bit bigger on the weekend.

Weekend lunch comes with option of adding $3 for soup or $8 for soup and cake.  Server brought cake selection to the table for you to pick which was nice, variety included mango, chocolate, tiramisu, etc.

Yummy fusion pastas and cozy restaurant within Jtown."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I was expecting coming in here. I read through the reviews and saw some pictures. I was most excited for the nori fries but other than that, nothing really popped out.
Be sure to make a reservation because they get pretty packed on weekends!

We got an order of nori fries, I got the smoked salmon pasta and he got a tomato sauce pasta. The fries was meh... I was expecting more seaweed taste, maybe I should have gotten to okonomiyaki fries instead. Pasta was good but nothing too special. Their portions are huge so be mindful when you order. Sharing might allow you to try more things!"}
{"text":"Huh I think Shiso Tree Cafe has been around for a while actually! Don't know why there's no review up. In any case this little cafe located @ J-Town serves an interesting combination of Italian and Japanese (Wafu) pastas, along with pastries and different flavors of coffee.

On my visit, there was only one waitress working the small seating area, but service still took rather long.  The waitress also forgot about our coffee orders once, but was at least apologetic and trying her best. 

The food itself was quite delicious -- the carbonara was creamy, eggy, and bacon-y, with green peas to add extra flavor, texture, and color to the cooked to al dente pasta. The other pasta we ordered, a wafu pasta, was interesting and good, though the carbonara was definitely superior.

There aren't many good pasta places in the area from what I know and each pasta dish is quite cheap ($10-$12, iirc), so this is totally worth a shot if you haven't tried it already!

For the full scoop, please check out my blog, located conveniently in my profile. Cheers, everyone! :)"}
{"text":"I love this cute little fusion Japanese café. The style reminds me a lot of times in Japan. 

I find the menu limited BUT enough for all tasting. The lunch menu is cheaper $8 for pasta, salad and soup of the day or $9 for udon/sandwich. They also have poutine available during lunch hour. However, lunch portion is much smaller (like maybe a bit less then 1/2 of dinner's portion). It may not be enough for someone particularly male who eats a large portion on a daily basis. I find the lunch portion was just right for me. (Very similar to portions that was serve in most restaurants in Japan for lunch menu)

Dinner is full portion, which I often need to pack 1/2 to go and save it for the next day. It is of course double the price or $5+ of lunch prices. 

Reasonable pricing and excellent food quality. 

I love the pasta, chewy and flavorful with the sauce. I like all of their sauces; from cream sauce to tomato to wafu sauce. I enjoy the garlic bread that comes on the side with the pasta. The bread was from Bakery Nakamura I assume. The dough was chewy, after toast was crispy. The flour has a hint of sweetness to it. 

Poutine was surprisingly good. I am not a fries person, and I don't mind ordering again. I had their nori fries which is wafu dressing with nori (seaweed). Simple yet yummy. Fries were crispy on the outside and soft potato texture inside. Every bite was hot and fresh. Not greasy at all. 

Dessert is good too, especially when you end your satisfying meal with a piece of cake or crème brulee with a cup of coffee. Typical Japanese café style. :)"}
{"text":"First time to be here, I've tried their singature Shiso Tree salad &  seafood pasta in tomato sauce. We have had this kind of Japanese style Italian food in Tokyo couple years ago, taste was good :)
In this visit, their staff gave our pasta to next table by mistake, the customer didn't realize that is the wrong dish & he ate it. We've been waiting for about 20 mins , until a staff brought another pasta to the next table, that customer said he didn't order that... ... but that was the one he ordered! We were odd & thinking about to leave, but then the staff told us kitchen will prepare our pasta in 5 mins so we stay.
It was a very busy Saturday afternoon, only 3 waiters working."}
{"text":"The Cafe is nestled in the wonderful J-Town alcove found in Markham. It was quite empty when we came in, it was still a little early. The food was decent, but the atmosphere could do for a bit more character. We ordered the Nori fries (it was ok, not good) and the spaghetti. Spaghetti was tasty!"}
{"text":"This place was a surprising miss for me. I pretty much adore all the stores in J-Town (Tora Fish that replaced perennial favorite Taro Fish being an exception in the past)
This place got really busy after we were seated as there was a steady flow of customers being a weekend. A good sign. 
I have only tried a couple of Wafu (Japanese take on pasta) style dishes in the past and they were how one would describe vanilla. Not too aggressive in taste and would pretty much not offend anyone.
This time I wanted to experiment so went for something that would challenge the norms for pasta. 
Nori Fries come recommended so had to have those. After giving the menu a good read I settled on the Unagi Don. My dinning companion had a tougher time as there were few dishes that could be had on the Wafu menu. After a bit of deliberation settled on ordering the sukiyaki pasta (without the mushrooms)
Nori fries arrived first and looked good. There was healthy topping of thin cut nori and nori flakes also generously sprinkled on the fries with a clear glaze. I enjoyed the first few bites and the taste is very unique for fries (kind of like chikwa with nori in tempura) Then the grease? or sauce started to settle and even started to leak on the table. Not an appetizing sight. We left the fries unfinished. 
On to the pasta again a healthy serving of nori and a very unique look. The meat portion were minuscule with a small serving of both beef and unagi. 
The pasta was cooked well but somehow the tastes didn't blend well. I had a glass of red which is priced well as the merlot was again vanilla. My friend had a similar view on the sukiyaki pasta. 
The service was attentive at first but was just overwhelmed when the place got packed. 
2 Stars."}
{"text":"I've only been to Shiso Tree once, and it was okay. Although their food is decent, I do enjoy the simplicity of their taste and ingredients - however, that's also the thing that doesn't draw me back. Often, when I feel like I can make a meal - which most of their meals are spaghetti with sauce, I'm not too compelled to come back. But if you are a fan of spaghetti/carb dishes, do give it a try! 

When I came here with my friend, we both got the uni pasta. The pasta was made well - al dente, came with soup and salad, but I found the uni pasta lacking. The uni taste was subtle. So subtle that it was almost not present. Although filling because it was pasta, I wasn't satisfied."}
{"text":"I think this is an excellent place to go for lunch, and I would definitely return. For the low price of $8 (somewhere around there), you get a soup, a salad and a pasta. Although the pasta doesn't come in a particularly large plate, it is still a decent size, and when combined with the salad and soup it is actually quite a filling meal when you consider the relatively low price you're paying. The only disappointment was that  the okonomiyaki pasta was the only item on the menu which actually mixed japanese and italian cuisine on the day that I went (something else that was japanese sounding was crossed out), while the rest of the pasta options lacked any obvious japanese influence. Aside from that small issue, I thought the food was pretty good overall. I also recommend the special flavoured coffees that come at $2 each. I tried the creme brulee coffee, and although the creme brulee flavour doesn't quite jump out, the taste was definitely there and I enjoyed it. I will likely return for dinner in hopes of a larger menu that carries more japanese/italian influenced dishes!

**if you are not full from the lunch menu, i highly recommend visiting the nakamura bakery nearby!"}
{"text":"If I had not followed a friend, I would not have known where the cafe is. It is situated beside Juu Izakaya, but on the 90 degree angle. The plaza is small, but it's definitely not somewhere I could have found myself. 

When my friend first told me of this place, I got confused - Japanese style pasta was how he described it to me. I couldn't quite grasp the terms to that, but I am glad I came. The place is quite cozy when you walk in, but there is more space left and right in the interior. 

My friend ordered the Unagi Don Pasta while I ordered the Sukiyaki. The plating is indeed very elegant - and it is indeed pasta. When I tried my friend's Unagi Don I found it okay. The sauce was really rich and creamy. He liked it but I suppose he didn't find it anything different from other creamy pasta dishes he has tried in the past. What I did really love was my own dish. The sauce used in the Sukiyaki was absolutely perfect. (Blend between Italian and Japanese cuisine). It's slightly sweet which is what I love, and what my friend does not love. The noodles are made perfectly al dente - I don't really know what else to say. Then I looked over to the table on my left and my jaw dropped at the sight of the Okonomiyaki-Style fries. It looked amazing! Too bad we were way too full to order more food, else I would have definitely ordered those fries. Next time!

Overall, the food was great - the sauce is absolutely amazing for my dish. Period. The service was swift and courteous. It did take awhile for us to get the bill, but that's because they were holding a full house. So it's understandable. The cost of the food is fair. I would definitely want to go back if I am back in town!"}
{"text":"Shiso Tree Cafe is a very cozy Japanese pasta restaurant. We ordered nori fries, smoked salmon rose pasta and Carbonara pasta. Both pasta comes with a toast and salad. Unlike the normal complementary salad, the salad sauce is not too cliche. The taste of the pastas are very clean and tasty. The nori fries are crunchy and the seaweed taste are not overpowering. We will come back to Shiso Tree Cafe for sure!"}
{"text":"At first I liked the idea of Japanese-Italian fusion, mixing something like sukiyaki with spaghetti sounds appetizing and when I heard this restaurant had opened, I had much anticipation to eat there. When I went there during those monthly sidewalk sales that often interests me, I found out that there this cafe opened, I really wanted to try it out.

Going into the cafe, I am quite pleased about the atmosphere mixing Japanese with Western design that was affected in the place. The ambience and vibe that I am getting felt like an actual cafe, from the soothing music to how relaxing it is when the restaurant was completely emptied during the afternoon. It's really a place like Italian restaurants, that it seems to fit into the romantic crowd not really for families. The place even has live music or what I assumed when I saw a small stage with a drum set.

I was disappointed that I did not go here on the weekdays as lunch specials were only on those days. I ordered the Napolitian which is spaghetti with sausage, small bits of onion and nigri (seaweed) including half a slice of garlic bread and salad with a putrid sauce that I did not like. It costs about 10 bucks and I was actually good while it was kind of oily and the seaweed had left a foul aftertaste plus there are only a few slices of onions, it was still a relief to eat it. 

One of my friends had ordered salmon with spaghetti which was even worse; the salmon tasted bitter (it almost tasted like it wasn't fresh which is a damn shame considering there is a supermarket next to this freaking place) and they did not remove all the bones which completely destroys the dish. 

However I did have a good time at that place considering it was nearly empty but to my surprise the service wasn't that great for a cafe with Japanese staff. I mean I get more customer service in the freaking supermarket with the staff there being polite but the waitress/hostess or whatever did not ask, at any moment if my dish was alright although she did refill my water. 

I might try this place again if I am craving for Italian-like dishes but I did not like the fact that some of these dishes were served with seaweed on the top."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cozy and the service is decent. I went around 5 but dinner didn't start until 5:30 but they let us sit for tea and desserts while we waited. We got some cakes from the supermarket beside but they wouldn't let us munch on it while  we waited for it. Normally I would understand but the desserts they promote are all from the supermarket beside. That was very strange. The okonomiyaki fries are are good and the only thing I really like there. They use the same sauces from takoyaki balls on fries. It's genius! The portion size is really good too. The pastas aren't  too good though. Reasonably priced but very cheap on protein. The shrimp okonomiyaki pasta and the corn of cream shrimp pasta includes 4 pieces of shrimp and a lot of pasta. The Unagi pasta includes a tiny piece of fish and too much pasta. Need to work on portion control. Overall it isn't a bad spot for Japanese inspired dishes. Check out if you are close by!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I've been dying to come to  J-Town to try the restaurants in this complex and my first stop was Shiso Tree! I had seen so many pictures and snaps from different people visiting this restaurant so naturally, I had to try the food for myself. 

As an appetizer, we got the special - Japanese Poutine. This dish was full of flavour and the gravy had a very unique taste. The gravy could have been hotter so that the cheese could have melted better but as a dish overall, I the flavour profile was on point -- you could taste the dashi gravy and I loved that it was topped with shredded nori. A must eat if you go! 

For mains, we got the sukiyaki pasta and the unagi pasta. Both were very flavorful -- the unagi was super creamy and the sukiyaki was lighter and more refreshing. I did prefer the unagi and on the day we went, it was definitely a popular dish as I saw many unagi spaghetti plates moving out of the kitchen! Amongst those plates, I also saw lots of the clam spaghetti too so I made a mental note to try that dish the next time I visit along with dessert. 

We didn't get a chance to try the desserts this time around because we were SO full but I definitely would come back for lunch (they have a killer lunch special), dinner and dessert! Yumm!"}
{"text":"The service is good, and the food is good, but I agree with what someone said about the tea. I expected a loose leaf blend for $2-3, but it was just a tea bag.

We had the nori fries which were reaaaally good. The noodles in the pasta are cooked al dente to perfection, which was great, although I think they could add more sauce. I know it's a fusion restaurant, so they try to stay away from super saucy italian pasta, but the noodles were a little too dry. I got the shrimp dish and a friend of mine got the mushroom dish and we both wanted more sauce. Our other friends got the beef dish which looked relatively saucy.

Everything else aside, the flavours are great in all of their dishes and their ingredients are noticeably fresh, so they get a solid four stars from me."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for an update because I have tried a different dish. 
Similar to my previous post, this restaurant has an interesting jazz vibe. Servers are all Japanese/Asian but the dish are all Italian.

This time I ordered Tarako Spaghetti. This dish is basically cod roe spaghetti in a light cream sauce. The cod roe are all mushed with the nori sauce. All the mushroom are sliced thin. The dish itself is very salty but I really like how it blends with the pasta. Without the salty sauce, the pasta may taste bland, since there isn't much of other content besides the mushrooms. In addition, the pasta is cooked right and has the al dente feel. Similar to all other pasta dishes, they give you a half toasted bread on the side. Also, each dish is complemented with a bowl of salad.

If you like more, you should also order their mushroom cream soup. The unique thing about this is that it comes in a cup!"}
{"text":"Japanese fusion? Can't believe I haven't been here sooner! Small intimate area in the \"heart\" of J-town. Have a vareity of Japanese Western fusion foods. The Okonomiyaki fries are a must-try and to die for! The portion is pretty big and is good for sharing. The Wafu pasta section consists of different pasta dishes that combines traditional Japanese sauces and ingredients with Italian pasta! I tried the Sukiyaki pasta and it was delicious. The perfect combination of sliced beef with a sweet soya sauce mixed with carborific spaghetti! There's lots of beef in the dish and it's topped with a heap of seaweed. Overall, I love the creative fusion dishes and the service was good. They also have a good selection of desserts!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed as I was so hyped up by the idea of Japanese pasta. This place was also surprisingly expensive for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Between the two of us, we ordered a mushroom pasta ($11), steak and frites ($20) and a mango smoothie ($3.50). With tax and tip, the lunch came out to $45. I didn't see any of the $8 lunch combos that other folks have mentioned. UPDATE: Jennifer K. mentioned to me just now that lunch specials are only available during the weekday, which is probably the best time to go if you're really interested in trying out Japanese pasta. 

We were a group of 6 so were given the shoes-off seating which the kiddies really enjoyed. Service was efficient and the food came pretty fast.

The mushroom pasta really wasn't memorable - I could have made it at home. The steak was just disappointing - the quality wasn't anything special. The best part was probably the mango smoothie. We also tried out some nori fries, which while delicious, were really quite oily. Of the various options in J-town, I probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to celebrate a family member's birthday.

I was really looking forward to tasting the Japanese- fusion inspired fries and pastas.

For $8 you get your choice of pasta,  a cup  of soup, a small salad and a slice of garlic bread. Not bad!

Honestly, I agree with other Yelpers that you may be full from the meal, but somehow flavour was really lacking with several of the pasta dishes. It's like, \"hand me some salt!\"

After ordering 4 pastas and 1 plate of fries to share amongst the group,
the only thing that stood out was the

Okonomiyaki UDON: 5/5. 
It was really creamy and had lots of flavour because of the bonito flakes *we ordered this twice*.

The okonomiyaki fries: 1/5, on the other hand, was a flop.

In lieu of dessert, I got a flavoured creme brulee coffee: 4/5. 
That was the second highlight of the meal (free refills).

I would return again, but next time I'll know exactly what to order."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 stars.

In Toronto, this is the best place I have had in terms of Japanese style pasta. I really love going there for pasta and the pasta dish I love the most is the one call \"Sukiyaki\". It's pasta with a variety of mushroom with some thinly sliced beef cooked together with some Japanese soya sauce together with the the pasta. The flavor is rich, in my opinion. And if you add another $3, you can get a cup of soup of the day. Their Soup of the day I have tried is always a kind of Cream of XXXX where XXXX = potatoes or tomato or Broccoli or corn.

Once in while, I guess depending on who is in the kitchen, the pasta dish can get abit salty at times, but most of the time, it's very delicious!

Oh, I love their fries too, particularly the one with seaweed in it but I forgot what's it called on the menu. But I am sure you can find it when you read the menu.

But I would skip the coffee ... is just not my kind of coffee."}
{"text":"Overall Rating: ****
Food: ****1/2
Service: **1/2
Ambiance: ***

Located in the same plaza as J-Town, the Japanese \"groceries\" store on Steeles is Shiso Tree Cafe.  It all started with just a bakery section within J-Town, but now they have their own cafe directly across from their bakery.

Shiso is a fusion lunch joint serving up Italian/Japanese fusion pasta dishes along with various items you'd find in a cafe (e.g. teas, coffees and pastries).  Unfortunately, for those of us who don't live in Markham, this means that the only chance you may have to experiences Shiso is on your day off as they are only open for lunch service between 12PM to 3PM Tuesday through Friday.

Lunch sets are $8 and includes a soup, salad and \"garlic\" bread along with your choice of fusion pasta dish.  I use the term garlic loosely as to me it was just a slice of toast with some butter on it - the garlic went AWOL.The soup of the day today was a Shoyu Bonito Broth, which appeared in our bowls in the form of a creamy soy sauce and fish soup adorned with croutons.  The soups are served in cups, which makes for easy  sipping towards the end, and the soup was quite smooth and rich.  The croutons were a tad bit oily but still crunchy when brought to the table.

The Shiso Tree Salad was also very tasty, with its housemade Wafu dressing which is a soy-based dressing most often mixed with vegetable oil and mirin. 

For mains we ordered the Okonomiyaki (sautéed onions, bacon and garlic dressed like an Okonomiyaki-style pancake), as well as the Tarako (cod roe, garlic, and shimeji mushrooms).  Both were made with spaghetti.  Of the 2, I preferred the Tarako as it was made with very simple ingredients, but was still bursting with flavour.  I found that the Okonomiyaki, though still tasty, had too many flavours trying to vie for centre stage and as a result, nothing really stood out.The portion sizes were perfect and allowed room for dessert, coffee and tea afterwards.  

We ordered a black tea and a green tea to accompany our meals (Asians are avid tea drinkers, and believe that warm tea helps \"flush out\" the grease), and I ordered a cup of their Organic Crême Brûlée Coffee to accompany dessert.  

I was really excited to see the Green Tea Red Bean Cake on their menu and had my heart set on ordering it for dessert, but unfortunately because I had arrived 1 hour prior to their close time - they were sold out.  Therefore, I settled on the Azuki Matcha Cream Toast  and a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  It is adorned with a homemade green tea sauce and sweet red bean with whipped cream.  I liked that they gave you a choice of whole-wheat or white bread.  The matcha sauce was very delicious but I didn't see any red beans in my toast?  I think the server must've misheard me and just given us the Matcha Cream Toast.  The bread was salted, probably from the use of salted butter.  If it were up to me I would opt for unsalted butter. 

Verdict:

All in all, I enjoyed my dining experience at Shiso Tree Café.  The décor is a perfect example of fusion - with 2 traditional tatami-style rooms, a breakfast bar top, and an array of tables.  I enjoyed the quaint décor and the bright windows.  Instrumental music plays in the background to allow for a relaxing lunch or tea break.  Perhaps the only thing that was missing was free wi-fi but I guess they don't want diners lingering for too long seeing as they are only open for 4 hours.  A few things I noticed, but that do not overshadow the positives were: entrées being pushed out even before we finished our starters and that I didn't get to try the Green Tea Red Bean Cake, which judging from the many pictures I've seen of it, would've been nothing short of heavenly!  I will most definitely be back on my mission to sample the Green Tea Red Bean Cake.  The total bill came up to about $36 with tax and tip.  I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a cozy place to relax and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their lunch special is a good deal, and their quality has always been consistent."}
{"text":"We got a table for 2 on the friday night just before the dinner hour rush. We didn't have reservations but we were given a table anyways. 

However, shortly after our orders were taken we were approached by one of the waitresses. She said that we \"go outside\" once we are done.  She spoke in broken English so I won't blame her for her choice of words but the fact is she asked us to leave once we were finished our meal even though we showed no intentions of lingering. We just finished ordering! 

The pasta was very average. The fries are the only reason to be here. 

The service was slow...  When you ask me to hurry up my meal, maybe you should do your part and hurry up your service."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with friend. I found that the menu has changed, stronger sauce for winter. Love the idea changing menu over seasons.

My friend ordered the Sukiyaki pasta, which based on her research, is almost everybody's favorite. It turns out there is a reason to be. Sukiyaki sauce, with very tender beef slice. Just perfect.

I ordered the \"shrimp okonomiyaki\", taste just like Okonomiyaki transformed to a pasta. (or takoyaki :P)

We ordered the green tea cream bluee as dessert and called it a perfect night."}
{"text":"I usually visit here once every six months or so to meet up with old friends. I would not say it's our favourite restaurant for lunch, but it's definitely our default when we want an Asian fusion joint with a quiet atmosphere. There is a lot of natural light that streams into the small space during their operational hours, so that most likely contributes to this too, mood-wise. 

Its concept is nice: western cafe meals (eg. Pastas, casseroles, fries, etc.) with a Japanese twist. 

Even though I have a penchant for Japanese fusion cuisine, this cafe falls flat. When I first went here the servers were attentive and the food had a more memorable flavour. Now, the servers never swing by at all. Some may like this, but when one expects bottomless coffee to be refilled, this doesn't sit well. After receiving your food, don't expect servers to even look at you again (the two servers were too busy talking to each other near the cash register). I heard that there is a revolving door of workers here, so this may be why the staff seem less professional than I remember.  As such, be warned about the bill: I asked for split bills, but one waitress said that wouldn't be possible unless we paid in cash, whereas on my second attempt another waitress had split the bills for us without question. The food was nothing special either. I got the crab rice casserole, which hardly had any crab meat at all and which  tasted like a casserole from any corner HK style cafe."}
{"text":"Good place with good food and service. Pasta, salad, soup and cake are great. However, we're so sad that this place has closed for sometime due to renovation."}
{"text":"Have been a repeat customer of this place- it's a pasta speciality but I recommend to try the other items in the lunch menu as well! Chicken katsu is fried to perfection and the cut of meat is quite thick and not flattened.

Meals often come with a salad- small portion but I do enjoy the flavor of the dressing. This time around I arrived on a weekend and ordered a yakiudon with an onsen tamago as well ($9 + $1 for the egg). The sauce is simple but delicious and I left full. Thin slices of pork belly accompanied this dish, though not as much as I would have thought and there was more fat than meat on my slices. Nevertheless the dish was enjoyable and at a very reasonable price, I would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"What can I say?
I'm hooked to Shiso Tree Cafe's cheap lunch menu! For about $8-10 and you get soup, salad, and your main meal. I wish they opened a location near school so I can take advantage of their lunch specials more often!

The soup this time is a creamy potato soup (of some sort) which I absolutely loved! Wish I could have this on the daily... it was so yummy. Probably my favourite soup out of all the times I've visited Shiso.

I've previously tried the Japanese Poutine and Okonomiyaki Fries. So this time I went with Tartar Fries. At first, it tasted a little odd, but I got used to it. I used to eat McDonald's fries dipped in tartar sauce, haha. Though Shiso Tree Cafe's tartar sauce did not have that much onion in it, so it was more of a creamy tartar sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded more onion in the sauce since I love onions.

Beware, if you leave the food there for too long, the fries might get soggy from the sauce. But I was okay with that too, haha. My friend, on the other hand, wasn't... so more for me! Heehee.

I ordered the Shoyu Mushroom Pasta as I did before.
Still as good as I've remembered with tons of mushrooms and their light sauce. I like that their sauce is not thick, but more of a watery state.

As you come to a restaurant or a place more often, you start to notice the flaws a little bit more. We got one of our entrees order wrong, and we were also served salad twice - the server simply puts it down and walked away. We had to call her back to notify her that we had already received our salads.

Perhaps it's a one-off visit to Shiso Tree Cafe, I still love the place no doubt. Mostly because of it's cheap and good value food. I have yet to try their desserts but I definitely recommend trying their fries as it's really unique!"}
{"text":"Food as stellar prices were not...too expensive for what you get. Flavors were amazing! Price is the only deterrent for us coming back! Otherwise, great food!"}
{"text":"Nori Fries is Tossed with homemade Wafu dressing and Japanese seaweed.  Those of you who is a fan of seaweed will adore the Nori Fries.  The garnish, the smell, and the taste.. it is all SEAWEED!  However, the Wafu dressing made the fries very soggy and mushy.  In addition to that, when the Nori fries started to cool down after 15 to 20 minutes, it had a fishy scent and taste to it....http://bit.ly/1dyoqMi"}
{"text":"Okonomiyaki fries were the bomb! They were really crispy and a perfect balance of flavors.

Wasnt a big fan of the shoyu mushroom pasta though, it tasted a bit bland and the mushrooms don't really work well with the pasta. 

I would go back for the fries."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. I would give more stars for the food but the service is absolutely atrocious! I'm often in the area, shopping at jtown, and have stopped into shiso tree cafe for lunch or coffee. The service is continuously bad. I know, I know, why do I go back. This last time was especially bad. After lukewarm coffee and rude service the waitress comes to the table and just snatches a $10bill I had placed on the table in preparation for the bill. When I stop her to ask her for the bill first she seems completely baffled. I was already annoyed with the bad service and this just the last straw. The food is tasty and unique so its worth a try if you've got lots of time and patience. I think this last time was enough for me to say never again."}
{"text":"My first time here and i can't wait to go back :) had to shrimp okonomiyaki pasta and green tea creme brûlée for dessert. Came to around $25. Very cute little restaurant. Everything I had was yummy :)"}
{"text":"Used to come here very often, mostly for their okonomiyaki fries, which they give you tons of.

I tried many of their pastas, but feel they lacked topping and taste (everything that isn't flavourful is bland to me), and portions are too small.

If you come here, recommend the fries and the cakes."}
{"text":"One of the better pasta places I have been to in uptown Toronto. The taste is definitely different than Italian pasta joints cause this place is a fusion of Japanese style cooking on pasta. I always have the shrimp okonomiyaki, and that's my go to dish. Their nori fries are good and so is the poutine. However, must try the steak frites. Only thing to look out for is: must make reservations. Walk in for sure has a wait time. But the food is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"A pretty nice spot in j-town. A good selection of pasta at an affordable price. I came with my girlfriend on a Wednesday night at 8:15 and was told they close at 9 which is quite early. The restaurant is quite quiet but more of a place to have a quick meal than a date. The salad that came with the pasta was not that fresh but the sauce was on point. I would definitely recommend the shrimp cream of corn pasta ($12) and okonomiyaki fries. Overall I would definitely come again as their pasta was quite good for the price though portion was a bit small."}
{"text":"The food here is great! As a big fan of both Italian and Japanese cuisine, learning about Shiso Tree Cafe was a true blessing as it fused both of my favourite cuisines together. I've been here around 4 times now and every time, I grab the okonomiyaki fries - these fries are some of the best I've ever had, extremely fulfilling, and the toppings of the sauce and green onions really give the fries another dimension of flavours. You cannot leave the restaurant without having their fries! If you are concerned about how fattening the okonomiyaki fries are, you could try their nori fries which is great as well. 

Their weekday lunch specials are definitely a bargain - you get a soup, salad, and a pasta. I had their okonomiyaki style pasta, vodka salmon tomato, and their sukiyaki pasta. My favourite would be the first but all of these pastas are cooked to perfection - al dente and the sauces compliment the pasta well. 

It is a tad expensive, but the price you're paying is justified as there's nothing like Shiso Tree Cafe in Toronto fusing italian and japanese together. I also recommend grabbing their cakes (they're from the bakery nakamura) and also their green tea which comes with unlimited refills"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with friends but my favourite is still the smoked salmon vodka pasta. I really like the pasta itself and the garlic bread is always the best. However, I feel like they added a lot of MSG in there... Given the portion, I felt it's pretty pricy."}
{"text":"I went here with my sister for lunch and the food was awesome. Decent prices, decent portions and they servers were polite and quick. Love the nori fries , so delicious! Would recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"Last year, during the summer, there was a time in which I came at least once every week and the servers started to recognize me. What kept me coming back? I am a big fan of the salad and fries, which is a bit weird for a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant known for its pasta. While the pastas are delicious, they were also very big and creamy and I cannot possibly have them that often (especially after an order of their amazing fries). The salads use a really yummy Japanese-style dressing and the fries are a delicious Fusion experience (check out their Okonomiyaki or Nori fries). 

What also kept me coming back was the coffee, which was $2 for all you can drink and it wasn't just crappy coffee you can get anywhere. The atmosphere of the place is just so lovely. It's a beautiful modern setting with soft acoustic music playing in the background. It almost feels like I've been transported to a small roadside cafe in Japan. I've eaten in a lot of places around Markham, there really doesn't seem to be any other place that has the same feel. I think Shiso Tree Cafe is a unique experience in a category of its own."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very comfortable. The service is pretty good. The food is nice but little small portion for a big guy like me. The price isn't expensive but it should be little larger portion for a man."}
{"text":"We tried their fries, unagi don pasta, and salmon a la vodka cream pasta. Their fries weren't that good, they were over cooked. Salmon a la vodka was decent, and unagi don pasta was good.  Portions were on the smaller side as my husband was still hungry after the meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I tend to stick with the usual dishes when I visit which haven't disappointed including the Sukiyaki Pasta. I don't find the prices unreasonable, especially with the cake and salad set. That being said, the service is sometimes a bit on the slower side.  Hopefully they'll be a bit more daring with their flavours in the future but it's a great start."}
{"text":"on the menu the food sounds interesting, however on the plate, they were kind of plain, and I do not really taste any Japanese influence on the pasta at all. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. and each piece was coated nicely. the portions were just right for a girl, maybe too small for a man to get full from it. The fries are less oily now, but they are very dark, maybe the oil is bad? wouldn't recommend this place.

The place is not extremely small, however they decided to placed all the guest into one area. and the tables were way too close together. I was sitting beside these annoying people who talked too loud."}
{"text":"Now the TRIO is complete...

#1 Shiso Tree Cafe
#2 Niwatei
#3 Izakaya Ju

Shiso Tree Cafe replaces what once used to be a Cafe as well.  I'm pretty happy to see a Cafe here as the lot of food spots here do not have the environment for just chilling with a Coffee or Tea.  The Menu opens up to show your Coffee, Tea, Cakes, and Pastas.  

It's a perfect small scale Menu that won't overwhelm if even the Cafe Green Tea(31 items) do you in.  This trip I focused on an after-meal chill therefore I cannot comment on the Pasta which ranges around the $10.00-12.00.

Organic Sencha Pear Tea($3.50) is very floral of that Pear scent.  It works well with the Red Bean Green Tea Cake($5.00) and probably the Rare Cheese Cake as well.  I feel like I'm reviewing Bakery Nakamura which is just steps away as well because that's where the Cakes come from and better to ask them what's in the Rare Cheese Cake then the nice Lady waitress.

The setting is of a normal Cafe while on one side has a bit of the Japanese Tatami seating although it has room for your feet, and not sitting flat cross-legged.  Ladies BEWARE, the bright spotlighting from the top can be very revealing therefore make sure you overdose on Make-up if need be.

{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the famous Japanese pasta.

The pasta was made well.  I found the shio sauce to be on the salty side, however it was quite flavourful.

Service was good - waitress ensured our water was always full and was very pleasant."}
{"text":"4th time coming here, lacks service. I had to wait a fairly long time to get my food. I Ordered the carbonara and tarako spaghetti . I found the carbonara very salty and had an aftertaste. The tarako was a special -cod roe in a cream sauce with mint leaves and seaweed. That dish lacked flavour. Recommend to reserve to avoid disappointment as they are usually full house."}
{"text":"Came here three times, twice for dinner and once for lunch. 

It was a cute little restaurant inside J-TOWN and it wasn't difficult to find. Walking in, the first thing I saw was a drum set, and I thought to myself, is this a place where they place music? However, I don't think the drum set is used occasionally. 

I would definitely rate lunch over dinner as there were less people and the food was actually tastier during lunch. This time, we went during dinner.

From the photos that I posted, we got:
1) Unagi-don ($17)
2) Shiso Clam Vongole ($15)
3) Shrimp Okonomiyaki ($14)
All three of these came with a complimentary soup and salad and a piece of garlic bread on the side.

I've never heard of a Japanese pasta before, but I'm glad I tried it because this tasted really good. Instead of having pasta with the regular tomato or alfredo sauce, this added a twist to regular pasta. The unagi, shrimp and clams were delicious as well as it was rich in flavour and cooked to the right amount of time and temperature."}
{"text":"We love the food here! Our favourites are the pastas (especially the tarako, uni, & okonomiyaki pastas), steak frites, & chicken katsu curry. 
The customer service was prompt, would prefer of they were a little more friendly though. However will still come back again in the future for more!"}
{"text":"There sauces are very well done. Great italian and japanese fusion pasta and rice dishes. I enjoy their curry chicken katsu rice. I like the spicy option, nice flavour and chicken portion is a good size. The other great dish they have is the unagi tamago don. Great flavour as well.

Their spaghetti dishes are also great. The mushroom and shrimp okonomiyaki are great options. Their more italian style pastas are also good, flavour is well-balanced.

One warning is that service is quite slow when they are busy, so try going during off-peak times if you can wait a bit."}
{"text":"This place has been my favourite restaurant in J-town for the past decade. All of their Japanese fusion pasta are usually very good. But I was a bit disappointed at their smoked salmon vodka pasta last week. Their smoked salmon used this time was not the same grade it had used a few years back.  I thoroughly enjoyed their Bolognese sausage pasta - the sausage, ground meat, and dipping that garlic bread into the tomato sauce.  

Nori Fries were great as per usual, but it was quite a greasy combination with the Bolognese sausage pasta, definitely an indulgent guilt-inducing lunch for me.  
   
No wait time for 2 ppl around 1:30pm on a Sunday.  The only thing is though their staff were friendly when they saw you, it was hard to get their attention."}
{"text":"Came a few weeks ago for a weekend lunch. Their weekend lunch menu differs from their weekday lunch menu. Their weekday lunch menu is significantly cheaper. I've come for dinner before, and I remember their okonomiyaki fries are delicious. This time, I had their baked crab gratin on rice (something like that). If I recall correctly, it was supposed to be snow crab in cream sauce atop tomato rice, baked with breadcrumbs on top. The pictures do it more justice than I can describe it. Taste-wise, it was not very impressive. I couldn't find or taste much crab. It was all quite...mild. It was also slightly burnt. It came with a side salad that was a tad strong on the soy sauce, and not strong enough in the vinegar compartment."}
{"text":"it is what is is.. Shiso Tree is a simple pasta place.  Shiso tree is also the only restaurant in toronto that serves WAFU (Japanese Style) pasta.   

If you haven't had Wafu pasta, give it a try!!!   You'll either love it or hate it.  Most pasta dishes are $12, including:  Salad, Pasta, toast.  Price is pretty decent if you ask me and no way did they give up on quality.   Everything is great! Quick service, hot pasta friendly waiters.  What more can you ask for $12? (i know... i wish they have espresso but they don't , so I guess i can ask for that...especially in a place that serves pasta)

And of course some of you may prefer $3.99 Shanghai Noodle lunch special from China town.

PS.  They currently have a $45 fixe Prix special, including:  Lobster Bisque, Alaska King Crap Risotto and dessert.  I personally think it's a steal when some other higher end restaurants charges $30 for risotto alone without the King Crap."}
{"text":"I came here to catch up with my friends over lunch. It is a quiet little restaurant in J-Town that I recently discovered. I had the smoke salmon creme pasta and to this day, I still can't forget the taste. It was a wonderful combination. 

Also had the okinamiyaki fries as an appetizer (definitely get it as a shareable or else you will 100% be guaranteed a break out the next day if you ate the entire plate - its huge). When I ate my first fry, I was BLOWN out of this world. WOW. But as I ate more and more, it got more and more normal, and I realized it was not worth the calories for. 

I would definitely recommend Shiso Tree for a friends gathering or a date but not so much for a family dinner. Would return!"}
{"text":"First, this review is just for their TEA

Got there for a Tea/Coffee time with a friend, and the place is really good to have tea and chat, a bit quiet and comfortable... Unfortunately the tea is not that tasty (most watery) and over priced for a small bag of tea...

Service was great.. but if you come here.. get some food, their pasta is 5 Star!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!! YES TO A THOUSAND TIMES! YES TO A MILLION TIMES!!
This is one of the best restaurants in the GTA area and if you've never tried it.... my condolences! What are you doing with your life?! Stop reading and go try NOW.

This cute little restaurant is in jtown & it is not highly advertised so a lot of people don't know about it until they see the amazingly #foodporn pictures of it on instagram or facebook. You MUST go!
Parking can kind of be a hassle since there is so little room and so many asians. Ah well, it's worth it in the end.

The restaurant is very clean looking and adorable. Looks like a family run homey place and you can definitely get comfortable here.
The servers are amazingly nice and quick! They're always courteous and smiling, and you can tell they were taught manners before entering the service industry ... unlike most asian restaurants.
The food has a cute little japanese twist to it. There are japanese style pastas and other sorts of amazingly delicious food. The prices are off the wall! 8$ for pasta combo- includes soup, pasta and salad. Ugh... delicious. The pastas are a good portion too, not too much but enough to get me full. We don't want carb overload. 
The nori fries.... don't even get me started. I think I may have had an aneurysm right there in the restaurant because they were so fucking mouthwatering. Even after a few hours (I packed leftovers to go), they were still crunchy and unlike any other fries I've ever tried. 
The drinks are okay, it's not sweet at all so if you like artificial flavours.. these drinks are not for you. The strawberry smoothie could use more strawberry though. 

Bottom line is... THIS RESTAURANT MUST BE ON YOUR BUCKETLIST!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place. The lunch specials are a good deal, ranges from $7-12 dollars with salad and main dish. Dinner menu can get a little pricy but it's definitely worth to try it. Their okonomiyaki fries and pasta is really good! The curry chicken katsu is really good as well!"}
{"text":"Shiso tree cafe is an awesome, cozy place to eat some really unique food - where can one get Japanese pasta? Not very many places for sure! 

Came here on a rainy Friday night for a dinner with a friend and had a good time! I liked the ambience of the restaurant as it was really cozy and simple.  

We asked the waitress for her recommendations so we ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki and sukiyaki wafu spaghetti with a side order of okonomiyaki fries to share. We were really impressed with the fries. There were a ton and they were nice and crisp with skin-on (the best!). The sweetness of the steak sauce balanced well with the freshness of the green onion and creaminess/sweetness of the mayo! The pastas were tasty too. The shrimp okonomiyaki tasted exactly like the fries except it was on spaghetti with four shrimp. Personally I found the sukiyaki better than the shrimp but maybe that's because I indulged on the too similar okonomiyaki fries first. The shrimp pasta was on the heavy side but that's just me! All in all I really enjoyed this unique twist on pasta.

The short cake (from the nearby nakamura bakery) was a nice way to end a good meal. 

On the down side, I wish we ordered one of the other pastas for variety because everything tasted too similar (sweet tasting) after a while. Next time I will opt for the tomato based and cream & rose based pastas! Value is not terrible nor great, but is decent.

Service was great, despite our exhaustion from skating earlier our thirst was quenched and our water were refilled frequently :) We arrived at 9pm and despite the place closing at 10, we were never rushed. We even stayed 10/15 minutes past closing without any fuss."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant. The atmosphere is quite family friendly. However, don't be fooled by the setting, the food is not just your average mom-and-pop shop spaghetti. Everything at this place tastes amazing (literally)! My friends and I ordered the Nori Fries ($6) to share. Then, I had the Wafu Seafood Spaghetti ($18), which is a seasonal special that is only available on weekends and for dinners. I would highly recommend both of these dishes! The spaghetti noodles came with clams, shrimp and squid cooked in shoyu and dashi sauce, and it's garnished with green onions, yuzu, nori and shiso. 
It should be noted that the portions at this place is quite large, so make sure that you go with an empty stomach, and you will be thankful that you have enough room to enjoy all of these delicious foods. The prices are also very reasonable, ranging from $14-$20 for entrees. Overall, this has been the best fusion experience I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and served piping hot with the freshest ingredients.  The Carbonera Shrimp pasta was classic al dente.  The new York strip was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The desert, which was the red bean green tea cake from Bakery Nakamura (literally 2 doors down) was superb. Will definitely come back. One thing that they may need would be more staff ..."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch (takeout) and dinner today! Staff were once again, very friendly and very courteous. They were accommodating but at times they were also a bit inattentive. The smoked salmon rosé pasta that I had for lunch was surprisingly filling! The pumpkin and crabmeat soup that I had as part of the lunch special complimented the salmon nicely. The Napolitan pasta that I had for dinner was just as delicious! The sauce was very flavourful. It has a distinct Asian/Italian fusion flavour that I can't quite put my finger. Nonetheless, it was a really good pasta. The Nori fries were also really good. Portions were big so it's best to order Nori fries when you're dining in groups. Not too happy about how greasy the fries were and how I felt super bloated after both meals. Despite feeling bloated, I'm definitely gonna be coming back for more - the Asian fusion pasta dishes are just oh so good!"}
{"text":"Japanese Fusion restaurant in J-Town (pasta, salads, fries, and dessert.) Come here for anything but the pasta - inconsistency issues

I can't speak for any component except for the pasta (unfortunately), since after coming here twice it seemed like the best deal. It's served with salad, soup, and garlic bread. 

The good: The salad is good. It's not watery like a lot of other places. Drizzled with what seems like a soy sauce vinaigrette but I could be wrong. Soup was a grainy cream of potato. Definitely something I don't come across often!

The bad: So both times I came in, I've had some bad luck of the draw. Though the spaghetti is thin and is cooked al dente, it resembles \"Sidekick\" pasta, which is common in Japanese cuisine. I'm envious that both times I went my friend's mushroom garlic butter pasta/unagi don tasted relatively good, but something always seemed to be lacking on my plate. The first time I came in, garlic bread was missing, the second time, there was a lack of smoked salmon ( I got miniscule slivers which is probably half a slice shredded up)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I was pleased with the food and service. It's a bit hidden as it's in the centre courtyard of the mall right across from the Japanese grocery store.  The restaurant is a pretty good size so I've never had issues just dropping in and getting a seat right away during normal dinner time hours (weekdays and weekends) with 3-4 people each time. 

Now onto the food! I got the nori fries both times. The first time they were just normal fries with a sweet sauce and shredded nori on top (not that great) but the second time - wow, they were so good. I'm glad they changed up the recipe and made it so that the nori is mixed in with the fries so you get a taste of seaweed in every bite. Needless to say they went very quickly when they arrived the table. We then got the smoked salmon appetizer on top of some garlic toast. This was very delicious as well as it had large fish eggs on top. I like how they just pop in your mouth! 

For the entrées we got the smoked salmon with vodka sauce pasta and the okonomiyaki pasta to share. We were a bit disappointed that the okonomiyaki was not an actual pancake but was just a pasta version. It was a hit with my friends although I personally thought it was a bit dry. The grilled shrimp on top was cooked to perfection though! On the other hand, my friends didn't really enjoy the smoked salmon pasta but I loved it, as someone who enjoys a creamy pasta from time to time. 

For dessert we all shared a black sesame crème brulee. The crème brulee tasted more like a mousse to me, it was very light and a bit airy. The black sesame taste was definitely there and not too heavy. 

They have a daily menu as well that changes up if you want something different than their standard menu. They had some really good options such as a seafood stew, a Japanese style poutine that I was eying and steak frites all for a pretty reasonable price. I will be back for sure! 

Free parking can easily be found on the lot by the mall."}
{"text":"The best dish there is the Shrimp Okonimiyaki Spaghetti. If you absolutely positively want to have your mind blown, this $14 dish is the way to go."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that i had take out. 
I ordered the carbonara and the french fries with seaweed. Both these items were great! They are definitely above average in taste and flavor. The texture of the pasta was perfectttt! It was totally worth it (ordered  from the lunch menu pasta +Soup and salad). The soup was amazing i only wish i had more, i was sad when my spoon hit the bottom of the container. I also ordered a creme brule coffee that was above average as well. All in all i am definitely going to order again from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Asian-European fusion cuisine is usually poorly executed but I have found a great success story in shiso tree. They blend Italian and Japanese dishes in interesting ways that doesn't have either culture overpower the other.

I had a house made ravioli topped with braised short ribs. Many flavours and textures came together perfectly. Our table also got an order of kiso fries which, topped with seaweed and eastern inspired spices, easily feeds four people."}
{"text":"Lunch here is decent for the price you pay. Traffic around the area is terrible so it's a bit out of the way. 
We had the coffee which can be had with flavour shots but no matter what shot it's really really weak. 
For the meal we ordered up the Bolognese Pasta, curry Katsu rice and the Okonomiyaki  pasta. The food is a bit bland. I'd stick with the more traditional Japanese dishes as the highlight of the meal was Curry."}
{"text":"Not bad. Nice quiet lil' place. Nice Japanese pasta plates. Great service with polite servers, hence the better than usual tip from yours truly. Would recommend. Would go back and perhaps try the Japanese style fries."}
{"text":"Food is great. Portion is decent. Not enough for me, but maybe I'm just hungry after so many hours of work. Takes a while for the pasta to get here. Washroom is clean. Wall needs some renovation soon"}
{"text":"When i think about pasta i think Italian right? well These guys make a mean Japanese pasta dish.  I asked for fresh noodles and man it was delicious! i had the clam and marinara sauce and trust me this is worth trying.  Great service, great food.  i will be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant for many reasons. This is a restaurant located in the j-town area, and has one of the best spaghetti in my opinion in town. 

Ambience: the decorations and overall atmosphere in this restaurant is very stylish, and pretty much reminds me of a fancy coffee bar, but instead serves specialty foods. They used to have a band that plays on weekends, but they dismissed the band which is definitely a bummer. You can find cute, lovely decorations everywhere including a glass vase filled with origami stars.
3.5/5 stars

Service: the Japanese accented waitresses there are very courteous and nice. The main course did take longer than usual compared to other restaurants, but reasonable. 
3.5/5 stars

Food: I ordered a unagi don spaghetti with a glass of red wine. It was a really enjoyable dish that compares favourably to some of the restaurants in little Italy. The two slices of eel were nicely and freshly laid on top of the mouth watering spaghetti beneath, and definitely looked appetizing. The spaghetti itself was basked in melted, grinded cheese, mushrooms and other herbs, and tasted very nice. The extra spinach and seaweed intermixed with the spaghetti enhanced its taste and I really enjoyed it.
4/5 stars

Price: decent price, reflective of the restaurant and the quality of the food.

Health: this dish has unproportioned food groups, with carbs comprising about 70%, protein 20% with the remaining 10% being vegetables. Definitely not for the glucose intolerant, but ok for the occasional eat from a healthy individual.
3/5 stars

Overall, this restaurant boasts a relaxing atmosphere, courteous service and an excellent fusion of Japanese-Italian spaghetti. I would definitely come here again, best for bringing a few close friends to catch up, or double dates.

Overall rating: 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"I wish I came here earlier! It's a cute little Japanese restaurant with decent food and good prices. Theres an option to sit on the floor in a secluded area by the door which is pretty cool. This is a Japanese style café restaurant that serves Japanese-american fusion food. 

I ordered the okonomoyaki fries and yaki udon dish which both were pretty good. I really like the Japanese style fries with the toppings they added on top (the flaky stuff... Bonito flakes??) and the nori. The udon was abit too fatty and oily for me with all that pork fat but nonetheless, was good until the last few bites. 

I definitely will come back to try some more dishes. Service was great and our waitress always made sure our cups were full without us asking at all. Make sure to order the fries!!"}
{"text":"This place serves up japanese style pasta, and they do it quite well. My favourite dishes are their unagi pasta, shrimp okonomiyaki pasta and okonomiyaki fries. Their food is however too rich for my taste and I can never finish a plate of pasta without feeling bloated or too full, but I suppose this is a personal preference. I do come once a while and get my japanese style past cravings satisfied, while packing half my food home! If you have not tried them before, I would say come try it out!"}
{"text":"Tasty okonomiyaki fries! Great for after work \"happy hour\" with some cold, refreshing beer.  It starts to get crowded by 6:30 pm, so it's best to go earlier."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem (figuratively and literally!)  in what is known as Japan town (the name of the plaza).  You can't see it from the street, you need to walk through a little maze through the plaza to get to it. It's unassuming from the outside and you might just walk by this place thinking it is nothing special.  Don't think like that and give this place a try, you certainly won't be disappointed. 

The menu is refreshingly simple and has a good amount of choices but not overwhelmingly so (soup, salads, pastas, fries).  I had the Kinko salad which came with a piece of garlic toast and it was pretty delicious.  The portion size was more a dinner salad than a side dish so you will be fine just ordering this if you want something light but still filling.  I think it was like $8 :)  All the prices were really reasonable - you could totally have a meal/drink here for less than $20.

Definitely next time I am trying the fries and pasta!"}
{"text":"Lunch combo for $8? Awesome! Includes salad, soup, pasta, and a half a slice of garlic bread.

The sauce is really good I have to say, but I was a bit disappointed with the portions and the lack of \"filling\". I ordered the Tomato pasta with clams, but I found no clams.

I do like the selection of organic coffee and teas. 

I'll have to try the dinner menu sometime."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp in the search for okonomiyaki in Markham and stumbled upon the okonomiyaki fries. The fries, first of all, are huge and should be shared between 2-4 people. Being sort of an okonomiyaki snob, the toppings and presentation were true to the okonomiyaki name, but for some reason, they salted the fries. This made it too strong. There's no reason to add salt because of the already salty kewpie, okonimiyaki sauce, katsuobushi. Still a great dish, but I feel like leaving out the salt and also adding bacon bits would make it a winner.

Also tried the azuki cream smoothie. If you like red bean, you'll love this. Naturally sweet with a strong red bean taste.

I might come back to try other dishes. The menu is pricey, and I'm not big on pasta, but sometimes you want a little quality, presentation, and a relaxing atmosphere when eating, and you don't find that often in Markham."}
{"text":"Visited Shiso Tree Cafe with my friends on a Tuesday around 2pm, it was quite packed still! But the wait wasn't too bad, which was good! But if you are looking to grab something quick, this place is not for you. Service was rather slow here, whether it is the servers or from the kitchen.

This is a hidden little place in J-Town. Even though this place is called a \"cafe\" it served mainly and only fusion pasta dishes as entrees. The menu is divided into different categories of pasta selections. Though all the pictures on yelp looks quite delicious, I think it would be best to stick with the \"wafu\" selections. According to the servers, \"wafu\" means traditional Japanese style. I got a Napolitan pasta. They used a  special sauce that was made in house. It seems like a Japanese version of the traditional tomato sauce, however this is sweet! I really liked the sauce! The pasta has sausages, bacon pieces and onions. Overall it was pretty good to me, but the pasta seemed a LITTLE bit on the hard side, it was still bearable though. All pasta dishes also come with a small piece of garlic toast and the presentation looked very nice! 

This is a pretty cool place to try but it wasn't anything that over the top. I was full after my pasta so didn't get a chance to try other things. I am looking forward to coming back and try their specialty nori fries/Japanese poutine though! Maybe I'll do an update on that later! =)"}
{"text":"Past by this cafe a few times and never tried it. So today is the day! Inside is quite a small joint! Most of the items on the menu is basically all pasta. 

Went for the Pasta Set Meal, came with soup & a slice of cake. (Extra $8)
Starters: Green Salad
Soup of the Day: Creamy Veggie Potato 
Main: Smoked Salmon a la Creme Vodka $12
Presentation is quite nice on the plate. From top to bottom: Big Fish Roe, Minced Salmon Pieces mixed in with creamy vodka base sauce on a bed of spaghetti. 
Came with also a Garlic Toast Wedge. Taste was quite nice, but didn't really taste the smokiness of the salmon nor the vodka. 
Main: Unagi-Don Pasta $17
It was a Creamy Teriyaki Sauce with Bbq Eel on a bed of spaghetti with a wedge of garlic toast. Taste was also quite nice. Hubby devoured it, even though he was never really a pasta fan. 
Cakes: Tiramisu & Layered Cheesecake
Both were quite light, airy and full of flavour. Tiramisu was really moist with the coffee infused into the cream & cake. The layered Cheesecake had a sable cookie base with a creamy lemony taste and spongy cake piece on top.

Overall, nice dainty place for a quick meal. But come early cause it gets pretty packed later on during the day."}
{"text":"It was a nice little Japanese fusion cafe.  It was a little pricy for the stuff they give you though for lunch on a weekend.  The food and quality was good though."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! It can be quite hidden as it is located in Jtown just around the centre on the side. The sign of the restaurant is not facing the walkway which can make it difficult to spot. 

I've never had Japanese pasta until I came to this place. Almost like a fusion between Japanese and Italian food (two of my favourite food combined in one). If you know you're not a big eater, I recommend coming in on a weekday afternoon. The portions are smaller and lower in price. It comes with a soup and salad too. I had the shrimp okonomiyaki pasta the first time as it was recommended by a friend and it was delicious! I only wish I got it again the second time. 

I ordered the mushroom pasta the second time. It wasn't as flavourful as the shrimp okonomiyaki pasta but just A-ok. We've also decided to try the Nori fries as recommended on other Yelp reviews. We ordered it on a weekend and the portion was quite large. It's best to share with a table of 2 or more. We weren't able to finish the fries but regardless it was delicious."}
{"text":"Not a bad place in almost a hidden part of Markham called \"J-Town.\" Lots of Japanese grocery and food to peruse and enjoy. 

This place fits the cafe motif and gives a nice menu to compliment that with lots of light options, Japanese and fusion fare. I had the Japanese poutine and it was nice. Would I have it again? maybe. The presentation was definitely nice, and the green tea cake of the day pretty good as well.

Good for the experience to try it out if you're looking for something light."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekday.

For $8, you get a salad, soup, and pasta which is good value.

I ordered the okonomiyaki pasta and the okonomiyaki fries.  
I like the fries very much.  Large portions and very tasty.  Fries were crisp and liked the blend of mayo, green onion, and katsuobushi.
The pasta was under cooked and would have been good if it were cooked a little bit longer.

The service was friendly albeit on the slow side.  We would have like to have received our pasta while eating the fries but received them after we finished it."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm for a late lunch. The service is polite and friendly. Parking lot was half empty so finding a spot was easy. 

The menu is extensive and provides many choices. I ordered the Okonomiyaki fries and the Smoked Salmon pasta with combo. The fries were amazing and came in large portions (easily enough for a meal). The soup that came in the combo was a potato chowder which was also very good. The pasta was cooked al dente, just as everyone else has stated in their review. The sauce was good and not too salty. However, my friend, who ordered the clam miso pasta, said his was way too salty and struggled to finish his meal. 

We ordered a slice of cake to share (came with the combo) - green tea and red bean. The cake tasted strongly of green tea (yum!) and was slightly sweet, which was a great way to end the meal after all the carbs and oil in the pasta. The service is great here and the food is above average. I would come back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now, and I still quite like it. The place isn't too big and can get really busy. A very cute spot. I ordered the Sukiyaki Pasta and we got an Okonomiyaki Fries to share.

I really like the pasta here and my favourite is the sukiyaki. It's interesting to get the sliced beef and the soy sauce flavour with spaghetti pasta, a great combination. The sauce is a little salty, but honestly I like it salty and flavourful.

The fries are quite large, and they're generously topped with the Okonomiyaki ingredients.

Will return again sometime!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I have to say some of the most creative blends of flavor come out of the kitchen. As a chef I can appreciate the thought put into some dishes. 5 stars is not enough."}
{"text":"The soup and salad and cake was good.  But I was hoping for a more exotic pasta.  My friend craved for French fries.  So she order one.  Serving was huge but it was a fail.  Very oily and no crunch at all.  it feel like they stir-fry it.  Lol.  To end on a positive note, good service and a nice cafe to hang out."}
{"text":"I did a tv show here few years ago and really enjoyed the food.  I tried Japanese style pastas in Japan and Hong Kong before and always loved them.  This place is probably one of the first in GTA to offer these dishes, and I recommended many people to come before.  About a month ago I came here with a friend to have dinner and noticed how the food is not as good as before. The pasta dishes were salty and nori fries were mediocre.  I got the dinner set with soup and salad and dessert.  Soup was like a water down chowder, and the other dishes were not impressive at all.  The signature shiso leaves flavour was still there but the pasta and sauce weren't as good as before.  Made me think I would stop coming back."}
{"text":"Food portion its average, not too big or too small for the price it offers, small selection of food but surprisingly pretty good choices for the menu, they offer set of soup+cake for additional of 8$. Overall, I enjoyed having lunch there but would. E good if offer more choices."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert pretty late but they were still opened! 

The waitress was kind and very informative. Showed us the available cakes and brought them out at a reasonable time. 

Will defo go back. Next time we'll try the pasta."}
{"text":"This is a really cute cafe! It's a great place to catch up with friends or go on a date. I love their wafu pastas, especially the unagi one. Their nori fries aren't bad either but it's A LOT of fries for $7 - definitely for sharing. At the end of the meal, after eating the pasta with garlic bread and fries = carb overload. The meal was pretty rich and greasy IMO but still tastes great!"}
{"text":"First time having steak and frites dish here ~ wasn't expecting this to be so tasty!! 

Definitely not a western style fat n juicy steak. But it's got the flavour of Japanese \"wafu\". 

A bit thin sliced Striploin and perfect medium (I know.. usually I would get a medium rare, but since I never tried their steak here, just to be safe :p) 

They noted the steak is \"aged in house\", which I believe! The flavour is very well embedded. (But I will have to revisit the same dish to determine consistency, yes, I will revisit for sure!!)

Next time I would like to try their seafood pasta with tomato sauce~ (and steak frites again.. too much food)"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the many photos my friends posted from this restaurant.  Had the shoyu & mushrooms pasta, creme brulee coffee, and okonomiyaki fries.  The shoyu & mushrooms pasta was interesting, it still had a hint of italian from chef knows where...LOL.  The creme brulee coffee was a bit weak in my taste, too watery.  The okonomiyaki fries serving was HUGE, i did not expect such a giant dish for $8.  I'm glad I didn't have to finish it on my own but the Japanese mayo on it was really good.
Our meal started off with a small salad, I think it came with the pasta.  It was pretty good, dressing was similar yet unidentifiable.  
It wasn't very busy though, but we ate dinner pretty early around 5"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Shiso Tree Cafe so I'm kind of sad my experience there wasn't great.

We ordered at 1pm. 25 minutes later still no soup or salad and it turns out they had totally forgotten about us. It turns out they lost our order after we asked. I understand that it's the lunch rush, but I was on a deadline and was running out of time to be ready for work so maybe watch out for that if you need to go back to work.

I'm not sure how well the servers understand English here or whether they just assume what you want. When we called one of the waitresses over she came over, went back to where she was to get water, went to the table behind us and filled their glasses and then came to us thinking we had wanted water. we asked her about our food and a few minutes later she came back with our bill. I guess she thought we had already eaten and our table had been cleared.

Another server came back to us and apologized. I had a feeling they had mixed up our order and when when she double checked with us they definitely mixed up our okonomiyaki fries with pasta. The server was apologetic though and said it would be out in a few minutes. I think the servers need a better system to be more efficient - I saw two servers setting up one table together, twice - why do two people need to set up one table? It just seemed like it overall chaos and confusion for the servers.

Enough about the service and so the food arrived shortly after as promised but it was kind of a letdown. Portions are fairly small even for $8. I'm a small eater and I was okay but not stuffed.

1) Soup and salad - potatoey soup. normal. Salad - also normal but they don't dress it well. I normally don't like a lot of dressing and after eating the top lettuce leaves in the middle it was basically only lettuce with no dressing. By the bottom it was dressing that had dripped down mixed with water from the lettuce so I guess there was still some flavor there.

2) Okonomiyaki fries - after seeing again and again on yelp how good these were I had high expectations. However - when they came out they were cold - not even a bit warm. They also felt like old fries - as in they weren't crispy, they were hard. The inside even had that frozen fry feeling - starchy. There wasn't enough sauce for all the fries they gave us so after we'd finished the top all we had left was unsalted, cold, not crispy fries. For $8, the price of a full meal, I would have expected a little more.

2) Salmon cream pasta - after being forewarned by yelp reviews that the amount of salmon was minimal, I was still shocked at how little there was. The pieces of salmon were the size or smaller than the nail on my pinky finger and I have really small hands. The cream sauce though, was light and I thought tasted pretty good. Creamy with a hint of butter and dill without being too heavy. Just know that it's more cream sauce pasta than salmon.

My brother had the napolitan - Japanese tomato with bacon, onions, etc. Light, clean tasting tomato sauce but nothing amazing. Minimal bacon. Pastas come with garlic bread but again, the amount of garlic is super light and barely there. If you like your garlic bread to be more garlicky like western places you will be disappointed.

Overall, not the greatest experience and the food isn't worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Cold beer served in a tall glass.

Ordered:
Spaghetti, Japanese style.
French fries, with seaweed and mayo.
2 other un-memorable pasta dishes that came with a soup.

The only good thing about this brunch was my cold beer.

Authentic Japanese fare and Japanese customer service, but food was just expensive.   

Very home-made in taste that I regretted believing the other Yelpers' review.  The fries were just fried and laid out with seaweed/furikake/mayonnaise.  I am laughing now that some Yelpers found it, \"out-of-this-world-amazing\"!


Some of these yelpers, I think, are just obsessed with Japanese food that their taste buds just give 4 or 5 stars without mérit."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already and the latest visit was just as good as the others. I always get the $8 lunch special which comes with soup, salad and a bowl of pasta with a buttered up piece of bread. The portions are small but I can't complain as its only $8. One time I had to order 2 lunch specials for myself so for me its really $16 lunch special...LOL. Everything tasted good and the pasta was done just right. And because the portions are small it leaves you wanting more. Perfect size for the ladies though. 

To top it off I copied Jennifer K. once again and ordered the ice cream with red bean paste, whipped cream and drizzled with with a green tea flavoring. In Jennifer K's picture it came with melted sugar candy so I was so expecting to get the same but ended up with what I call a cigar cookie. What a disappointment. I was sulking in my mind and kept on screaming out \"I want my melted sugar candy\". 

To end the meal I also got a caramel flavored coffee and a cinnabon flavored coffee. They both tasted the same in my opinion. 

Great food at a great price with quick friendly service. The only reason I take off one star is that portions are a bit small and wished they had more pasta's to choose from. Even if I had to pay more for larger and more meat filled options I would not mind."}
{"text":"Been bringing clients here every time they come up to Makham and they are always surprised at how fusion this place is! 

They apparently make their own pasta in house."}
{"text":"This is a little gem hidden in J-Town, Markham! I went there for lunch on a weekday so the menu was slightly limited compared to the weekend/dinner menu but there is still a huge selection of appetizers and pastas. I chose the carbonara and my mom decided on the Napolitan pasta ($8 each) and we added coffee for $1.50. The pasta also includes a small salad and soup (cream of potato/cabbage). Service was great in general, presentation of the meal was great, and portions are smaller than usual but this is expected given that it is a Japanese restaurant. As for taste, I must say the Napolitan pasta trumped the carbonara. Napolitan is a tomato based sauce with sausage/onion bits. The sauce tastes like sweetened ketchup. The carbonara was not too bad but there was a bit too much pepper on top and maybe I am a bit of a traditionalist but I like the American-Italian style carbonara. 

All in all, great dining experience and good inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Overrated.

I feel JTown is purposely charging more and giving less quality. Which is a complete shame seeing how there are so many Japanese restaurants opening up in Toronto.

Lunch menu is TINY, my bf finished his dish in 3 bites. I had to give him some from my tiny bowl of pasta. The fact that food was bland, the price does not reflect. Soup was no good either. Salad was also tasteless and the greens were not fresh.

Would not return."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place in J-town and to my surprise this is pretty good. Went with a group of friends for dinner and we ordered 2 kinds of fries and we all ordered our individual pasta dishes.  

The fries was my first time trying them and I have to say they were pretty tasty. Loved the mayo dressing fries and the other one I cannot remember the name of the fries was pretty good as well. The pasta dish I had got was smoked salmon with Vodka. And I thought it tasted pretty good as well. 

A couple of concerns that I didn't really like about this place was where we sat. We sat in the booth where it simulated as if we were sitting on the floor. Also we needed to take off our shoes too. And even though there was pillows it still made sitting very uncomfortable, since the the space in there is small and its difficult to move in and out if someone is sitting on the inside.. Also it was right next to the entrance door so everytime when someone leaves or enters there is a huge gust of cold air coming in and you can really feel it against your feet.. 

Price for the pasta was a bit pricey in my opinion. Even though it tasted good, the portion is not worth the price. I devoured my dish in 5 mins when everyone else was still eating theirs and I had to pay $13 for mine.. I wish they would have given more pasta or something because for $13 its not really worth it.. And I was still hungry after that. 

Service was alright but I believe when you sit in those private booths alot of the times the waitress tend to forget that people and only remember you when the food is coming. It took 2-3 times to simply get hot water. Refills for water was a mission to do.. It got a bit annoying because they say they would come back and after a good 20 mins they still didn't return with the water... 

Overall, not a bad place, its quite hidden from Steeles. I would come back but for lunch instead of dinner. And plus it's CHEAPER for lunch and they give you a SOUP!! =D"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times over the years. It's probably one of the better options for Japanese Fusion in the area. However each time nothing really wows me.

Staff: I think they need to work on their service skills. The wait staff is always standing around the counter and requires me to flag down and ask for refills and stuff. No one really checks in on you. Flagging down someone isn't a problem except how the place is set up (there's an elevated area), they can't see certain tables if they don't walk around. It's mildly frustrating at times.

Ambience: It's comfortable, but I would say it isn't very accessible to everyone since there's steps everywhere. However it's got a nice vibe going on.

Food: I had the Bolognese Fries to start. It's a hefty portion and the fries were not the best. The only word I can think to describe it is \"potato-like\"? It wasn't quite fries, it wasn't quite wedges, and it wasn't quite potato skins; that's the only thing I can say. For my main I ordered Smoked Salmon a la Crème Vodka which was pretty tasty so I'll give thumbs up for that. The sauce was nice, and the salmon pieces were tender. Overall, it was quite filling.

I'll probably come back on the odd occasion."}
{"text":"I love coming to this little cafe just to grab a quick lunch! Been here many times over the year but I always end up digging into my food before I could take a picture. But this time I held myself back! I love love love their Okonomiyaki fries! It's such a big plate that it took 3 of us to finish. The location of this place is quiet hidden, but this cafe is location inside a small plaza called J-Town. The cafe decor is simple yet comfortable. The staff is super friendly and offered to show us which cakes they had before we ordered. The pasta looked like it was a small portion but I did get really full from it. Plus the fries it was a full meal! Definitely going to come back :) I want to try their new Japanese Poutine!"}
{"text":"It's a Japanese fusion restaurant. The environment is relaxed and quiet which is suitable for chatting with friends or dating. Food is average but no any surprised. Everyday they have daily special menu written on the blackboard. You can check it out first before opening the regular menu. Sometimes they will have a good deal."}
{"text":"I love to come here a lot. The japanese style pasta is something that I always love to eat. It doesn't have much varieties to choose but it helps out my craving from time to time. The waitresses are always friendly and polite with great smile. At the end of the meal, you can order the cakes as dessert."}
{"text":"If you love pasta, Shiso Tree Cafe is a must try! Pasta with a Japanese taste and style and excellent service - seriously what more can you ask for? 

The Okonomiyaki Fries is my favourite appetizer/snack to share with 3-4 people. The fries taste fresh (no freezer taste!) and it's drizzled with a good amount of mayo, steak sauce and green onion. At first I thought the mayo would be an overkill/heavy, but it was a good balance with the green onion. 

I tried a couple of their pasta, and I love the Smoked Salmon a la Creme Vodka and the Shrimp Okonomiyaki (...completely obsessed with okonomiyaki dishes). Good portion, great flavour, perfectly cooked pasta... and the garlic bread served along with it is a bonus!

Would I go back? YES, most definitely."}
{"text":"They have awesome lunch specials here for $8 which are all pasta dishes like salmon with pasta, and their special onokomya?? I forgot how to spell it lol but it's like a japanese pancake with teriyaki sauce over it, all pastas come with garlic bread, salad and soup, authentic Japanese food in jtown, portions are kind of small but that's what you would expect from Japanese food

We also ordered the nori fries which is heaven if you like seafood as it's literally drenched with seafood, also got the Japanese poutine which was meh, didn't have enough cheese....you should eat the fries quick when they are hot cause when it gets cold, doesn't really taste as good, also the fries are similar to New York fries....this place got packed right when it opened so be prepared to wait a bit"}
{"text":"Customers service and flexibility are lacking at Shiso Tree. We walked into the restaurant asking for a table for 3 people. There was a guy & girl together waiting in front of us. The restaurant was quite full on a Sunday night. There were 3 empty 2 seater tables available, with 2 of the tables being side by side and one 2 seater table in the centre. The waitress was 'smart' enough to let the guy & girl in front of us to be seated at the 2 seater table with another empty 2 seater table besides it. Then she told us we have to wait at least 20 minute for the next table. Couldn't she have seated the guy & girl in the centre 2 seater table and then combine the two 2 seater tables that are already side by side to accommodate our group of 3? We realized it would have been a waste of our time plus we don't want to offend the 'smart' waitress of how to do her job. We decided to leave."}
{"text":"Sheeeeeeeso this place is awesome!! A fusion of Japanese and Italian ... and then some, in a very quaint locale. Loved loved loved the nori fries and the black sesame crème brulée! Our dinner was very good, the pasta properly cooked, and the Japanese flavours went very well with the dishes. Dying to come back!!"}
{"text":"I love pasta. I love Japanese food.  There's a place that fuses them together??  I'm so in!!!

Pros:
Very unique pasta dishes
Food is very good
Servers are excellent

Cons:
Shio type dishes can be a bit salty

Like I stated above, Japanese and pasta are usually not two words I use in the same sentence.  So when I heard about this place, my mind was blown!!  It was obvious I would need to try this place for myself!  Shiso Tree is located in the J Town plaza on Steeles just past Woodbine.  If you don't know about J Town, you will never know about this place as well.  

As soon as you come in, the place gives off a lounge jazzy type of feel.  It's nice and quaint.  You're greeted immediately by one of their servers and seated as soon as possible.  Japanese restaurants always have excellent service.  It comes from their culture back home.  The servers are all very nice, polite and helpful.  I rarely have any problems with Japanese run establishments and this place is no different.  

Shiso Tree offers about 15 pasta dishes with a Japanese twist.  We ordered the Unagi Don and beef sukiyaki pastas (seriously, they managed to make these dishes into pastas, amazing feat in itself).  We added an order of okonomiyaki fries as well.  We asked if it was possible to order just a simple late of pasta and cream sauce for our little one.  They made it for us with no trouble at all and told us the price so there would be no surprises later.  Again, great service.

The pasta dishes were all excellent.  It's very interesting how they blend the pasta with the Japanese food but they do it well.  They don't skimp on the unagi either.  I got two big strips, for the price I paid, it was really good value as well.  The okonomiyaki fried were awesome as well.  They give you a huge plate of it as well.  Again, excellent value.  If there was anything to gripe about, it would be that the sukiyaki pasta was a bit on the salty side.  Still, I'm nitpicking here.

Shiso Tree is definitely on my list of places to go back to again.  I can't wait to go back and try the other pasta dishes they have.  If you want a different take on pasta, you need to go here and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I come here when I am missing Japan.  Their fusion pastas are good.  I for one, actually like my pasta a little \"al-dente\" and they cook it just like that!   Love a little of cream and cheese on mines, not like the ones you get in the Italian eateries with the heavy creams and sauces.   Don't get me wrong, I love my Italian pastas, but I also love the Japan infused versions too. 

I always come for lunch as I believe it's a pretty good deal for the set.  I've had the Okonomiyaki & Carbonara pasta here and I like them both. 

I come here when I have a \"craving\" moment.  It's a good place for what they have around that area."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant! We got nori fries to share with the whole table and it is delicious. Before, I couldn't imagine how people can rave about fries but the fries were really good! I don't remember the name of the pasta I got but it was a cream sauce with salmon. It was very rich and creamy which I loved. It was so rich, I couldn't finish it (it was probably because of the amount of fries I had too). I ended my meal with their famous green tea creme brulee and it liked it. I would try something else different next time though but give the green tea creme brulee a try if you've never had it. All in all, this is a solid restaurant and I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Japasta? Japafries? 

Another one of Toronto's ubiquitous fusion restaurants, Shisotree blends Japanese and Italian cuisine. Although this may seem new to North Americans, Japanese people have been doing this for a long time and has been a popular cuisine since post war Era.  Unlike Italian pasta which is often heavier and substantially richer, Japanese style pasta is lighter with Japanese style toppings including Bonito, roe, Wakame and more. 

Having tried some great pasta at Prairie Spaghetti house in Calgary I was excited to try this place. With 8 people in the group we ordered nori fries, okonomiyaki fries and poutine to start. Then we each individually had different pastas including shrimp okonomiyaki, miso vongole, special seafood, bolognese and another special. The nori fries were delicious and had so much nori. Both the okonomiyaki fries and pasta reminded me of a the famed Terimayo dog of Vancouver's famed Japadog. It was good, but definitely on the rich and heavy side. The poutine was just Ok and tasted like a regular poutine which I could have passed on. I had the miso vongole which I really enjoyed.  It was a clam miso white sauce on perfectly al dente pasta. It wasn't an overly strong dish and I enjoyed that it was light but still flavorful. Having tried it once I don't know that I would come back for the pasta. It just wasn't as standout as I would like it to be and felt a little underwhelming. Like one of our party said though, they should advertise this place as a japafries place because the fries were actually very good and quite unique
 If anything come try the fries."}
{"text":"Japanese fusion of pasta is great.. The only downside is that it is quite pricey..as the dish is mainly just pasta and sauce (~$14 comes with a salad).. On my way out I noticed that they have a weekday lunch special that offers most of the popular pasta choices for only $8.

The okonomiyaki fries are very delicious.. Fries with sauce and green onions.. Also quite pricey as they charge a steep $8 for a plate of fries. 

I noticed that the restaurant does not have good air conditioning/ventilation as it is quite stuffy; with the way all the sun beams into the restaurant.. The heat gets trapped. I felt like it was cooler outside than inside on that hot summer day."}
{"text":"The family went for a birthday dinner in J-town for a Japanese pasta meal. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavours and quality of food. 

I had the smoke salmon cream pasta and it was extremely flavourful. It comes with garlic bread and a salad for $12...,very good value in my opinion. 

I had the nori fries for an appetizer and it was delicious. If you like fries and seaweed then this is a perfect mix. I will be going back just to get these delicious fries. 

Desert was great. Cakes from the Nakamura bakery is a great treat. 

2 thumbs up, we will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I really enjoyed the peaceful and friendly atmosphere, I had the shrimp pasta, it was very well flavoured however it was a bit too salty for my taste. I've also tried the Sukiyaki (beef) pasta, its lighter so I liked it better personally. I'd come back again to try their other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Tried Shrimp okonomiyaki pasta because of my the other yelpers. If you know what okonomiyaki tastes like, that's what this pasta tastes like. The okonomiyaki fries were addicting even though they had the same sauce and toppings as the pasta. The bolognaise fries tasted like tomato pasta sauce. Everything was okay, not bad. Serving was also smaller than expected.
NO SIGN OUTSIDE. Came in at night and walked around the Plaza for over 10 mins. There is only an open sign... Very hard to find. No sign at all. I was looking for the one posted on yelp earlier but it's gone. Maybe it fell off..."}
{"text":"Their pasta is definitely not the best pasta I've ever had but I'm giving 4 stars because I'm a fan of creative and/or fusion food and good customer service which Shiso Tree offers. Their menu is also reasonably priced. 

Would recommend this place if you want to try something a bit different than the usual western pasta and a friendly environment. Get the okonomyiaki fries!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars but the food seems fairly uninspired and overpriced in spite of the friendly service. The idea behind this business is great, but I couldn't identify anything original about my pasta dish; it didn't taste any different than traditional pasta. In fat, I felt like I could've made it better myself. 

Sorry Shiso - I want to like you for trying to be different but you've got to work a little harder for the glory."}
{"text":"Shiso had alway taken the same week off (around Christmas) which happened to be the only week I usually visit my in laws. Since my husband and I finally visited during a non-traditional week, we paid Shiso a way overdue visit! 

We came 10 mins after its opening and the restaurant was already half packed. Soon after we placed our order, all tables were occupied. 

Okinomiyaki fries - a platter of golden and crispy fries - topped with a beautiful drizzle of okinomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayo, coated with crunchy, toasted nori and bonito flakes. Beyond delicious! 

Unagi don - perfectly cooked pasta tossed in rose teriyaki sauce topped with two generously portioned BBQ eels. I wanted to pick up my plate and lick every drop. Of course no pasta or eel left behind. Out of the world good. 

Shiso clam spaghetti - another winning choice. Generous portion of clams too! Again the pasta was cooked beautifully and the white wine sauce was just right! 

King crab gratin - baked creamy and cheesy King crab meat over tomato rice. You could taste the crab with every bite. Coated with crunchy panko bread crumb. My brother in law couldn't get enough. 

Pork belly udon - thin pork belly slices with udon in clear broth. My husband (again) didn't offer or gave me a chance to try before he polished his bowl. Someone was satisfied. 

Smoked salmon ikura pasta - we were expecting the smoked salmon to add a saltier profile but geez this dish was salted to the max. The ikura (also a tad salty) added another level of unnecessary salty flavor. Pasta was eaten but we didn't touch the ikura or smoked salmon. 

Since it was our last meal in Toronto (before a much needed diet), we decided desserts are a must. Matcha Azuki crepe and black sesame creme brûlée. The crepe had the perfect Japanese crepe texture and flavor. Topped with a dollop of sweetened Azuki beans, drizzled by a green tea sweet sauce, paired with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream - beyond delish. The creme brûlée had a strong black sesame essence. The custard was a bit too runny however. Also the top  was a bit cold and not crunchy enough. Get the crepe and skip the brûlée. 

Overall - way way way overate. The foods were just too good! I'm such a sucker for fusion foods - Italian Japanese? Such genius idea. Wished we had visited Shiso sooner! Definitely will be back and can't wait to try out their upcoming seasonal items!"}
{"text":"This place is easily missed for its location. Located right across from J Town (Japanese Supermarket). To be honest, I would not come here unless I'm craving for some Japanese influenced Italian pasta. In total I have been here four times and I really enjoy eating their pout Ines and pasta dishes. Since we only had 3 guest in total, we couldn't order too much food. I remember each time I go my spaghetti is always cooked al-dente, which to me is perfect. For my evening, I started with their toasted walnut green tea as an alternative since they didn't have the one that I want. Surprisingly the tea had the most elegant aroma which filled the table and all my friends had to have a sip of my tea. The tea was very refreshing and the nutty flavour from walnuts does help give the green tea a delightful aftertaste. I suggest drinking the tea when it cools down a bit so you can taste all the flavours better.

We all shared a smoke salmon toast which none of us really cared for. This dish was very bland and the garlic bread that it was served under didn't have much garlicky taste. The smoke salmon was fined chopped and served over some creme fraiche and topped with a piece of dill. I personally believe I can make a much better version of this dish myself in my home kitchen. I don't suggest this dish nor would I order this again. 

My main was the sukiyaki spaghetti. The name sukiyaki comes from a popular dish in Japan and basically it's thinly sliced beef that's served at the table in a hotpot style with soy sauce, Marin and sugar then dipped in a whipped beaten egg before eating. Till this day, I have not found a great place for sukiyaki in Toronto so I had to try out this sukiyaki pasta! The pasta was great, a nice subtle sweet soy based sauce with sliced marbled beef, green onions and nori. It's not like having the true sukiyaki experience, but definitely a great way of colliding Italian pasta to such a traditional Japanese dish! Somehow it just worked out and I really enjoyed it! I can't wait to try more of they different fun filled pastas! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Markham for some fusion pasta. Very flavourful and not too heavy. If you have it as a pasta set, you'll get soup and cake from J-Town bakery. It can get busy and party of four or more should call in for reservations."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here with friends and then came back the next day with hubby ! I'm definitely a fan and cannot wait to be back again.

Service was excellent and the food was served within 10 or so mins after we had ordered. 

The only bad thing is, Shiso is extremely busy. So either come super early (6pm) or come later (closer to 9pm). 

I really enjoyed the dishes from the Wafu pasta section where its fusion jap western mix. Particularly liked the Unagi Don (even though it only came w/ 4 small pieces of unagi). The sauce was delicious! It also came w/ garlic bread (the toast is similiar to the chinese bakery kind) and salad (love the dressing). 

I tried the Smoked salmon w/ vodka the next evening but wasn't impressed. Ended up swapping with my hubby who had ordered the Sukiyaki (I'm not a beef person) but it was tasty.  

Also tried the Nori & Okonomiyaki fries. OH wow they were wonderful. My only complaint is there is not enough mayo. You can always ask for more on the side."}
{"text":"Conceptually, really interesting. Japanese and italian fusion. 
Now it's a strange yet commonly noted phenomenon that some of the worlds best italian food is actually in ----Tokyo. So i was naturally excited to try Shiso tree. I was also a little shocked - for how popular italian food is with the japanese, why hasn't anyone thought of the fusion idea (that i'm aware of).
In any event, the food is interesting and well thought of. However, their ability to cook the food well isn't sadly not. Pasta severely under cooked and over cooked in another dish. And you just can't shake off the cafe feel to the food. I know - i should cut this place some slack because they are after all a cafe - but for such an interesting concept and from what i've heard about this place from visitors a few years ago - it was just a little disappointing. But i'll still be back and accept it for what it is."}
{"text":"Wafu seafood special: I just destroyed an order of this and my life changed forever. I was never a pasta person because when I think of pasta I think of grease, oil, grease and oil. BUT the pasta here has changed the pasta game for me. Typical me did not completely read the ingredients in this pasta before ordering but considering I love seafood, I ordered this. This pasta was packedddd with flavour. It was a flavour that I could not put my finger on, it was unusual but familiar. I looked at the menu again and realized that unique flavour that I've never tasted in food before is YUZUU!!! But Ive had it in drinks and dessert. Who would've known yuzu and pasta would go sooo well together? This pasta is not only NOT oily but also loaded with seafood like the name suggests and It does not cheap out on the seafood at allllll. I love clams so when this pasta came with 10 pieces of clams in shell (yes I counted) amongst shrimp and squid, it had my heart."}
{"text":"This place has always been on point and I've been here at least 5 times already, and it always gets better.

This just released a new menu and I've tried the Japanese Poutine, Okonomiyaki Fries, various Pastas, and Yaki Udon. It's all delicious and I'd highly recommend this place to anybody who likes Japanese but is looking for something interesting with the Japanese style. This place is always good and has always been good.

Very savoury and delicious food with such a unique menu, which you can't really find anywhere else around here."}
{"text":"I'm super happy to finally get to try this place out. Ordered the curry katsu don and the jap poutine. We came around last call and they were still willing to seat us. The curry katsu don has a extra spicy option and it definitely gave a better kick to the taste. The food and service is amazing here and it's a quiet atmosphere. They accept all sorts of payment."}
{"text":"So I had the pleasure of going a second time and I think I have to update my previous review. 

In terms of the atmosphere and the service, it was about the same, but the only difference was what I got this time. So my friend and I ordered the Okonomiyaki Fries to share and I ordered the Unagi-Don this time. To start off, the Okonomiyaki Fries were absloutely amazing!! If you're craving fries when you go to Shiso Tree Cafe, the Okonomiyaki Fries are a must! As mentioned before, if you're like me and you like creamy pastas, the Unagi-Don was perfect! The eel tasted amazing and the sauce was the best pasta sauce I've ever had in my life! 

Definitely try Shiso Tree Cafe out, it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I think I'm on a streak of ordering the wrong food.  This is suppose to be a highly liked resto but I just didn't like my unagi rice. 

Let start with the unagi, there were very little meat on the fillet, half of the fillet was skin and that slimy texture stuff (not sure what it's called), only a very very thin layer was the actual meat. I really don't like slimy gooey textured foods. Secondly, the egg was scrambled with quite a bit of butter, a bit overwhelming for my taste. 

I will give this place another try perhaps at dinner so I can order their wafu spaghetti. That looked good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times over the years and I've always left happy. It's Fusion Japanese pasta and always hits the spot. 

Price Range (Not including Tax & Tip): $6-$10 for the apps/salads, $9-$15 for the pasta. 

Food Quality (Taste, Serving Size, Menu) - 4.5/5
Every pasta I've gotten here, I've loved. I usually get the Shoyu Mushroom, Carbonara or Shrimp Okonomiyaki. They all are packed with flavour, has an amazing meat/veggie to pasta ratio, and the right amount of sauce. The serving sizes are pretty big and I always leave pretty full. I usually split the Okonomiyaki fries and Nori fries with my friends and both of them are good, with Okonomyiaki being my favourite because of the crunchy texture. They have a lot of different pasta options with different sauce bases. 

Atmosphere - 2.5/5
They have a pretty simple design that I find kind of boring, not really much going on. They are a medium sized restaurant so they have a decent amount of seating but I would make a reservation before going. This place is great whether you're on a date or with a large group of friends/family. They have a pretty big parking lot so parking is no problem. 

Service - 3.5/5
They are usually pretty prompt with taking our orders. The food doesn't take long to come out, and they usually bring everything together or close to it,  so you don't have to wait long when your friend gets their food before you get yours. They don't come by to check up on you as much but they will leave a jug of water at your table if you're in a large group. 

Would I go again?
Absolutely! Love this place, it's unique and always taste amazing. Plus I need to try every type of pasta once. 

Lash's Recommendations:
Okonomyiaki Fries - Best to split it with someone else. Has a lot of flavour
Shoyu Mushroom - Such a rich dish. Vegetarians, you'll love this!  
Carbonara - Probably the most basic thing here, but still really good if you want a classic."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I have to say the okonomiyaki fries are probably the best thing to order. It's only $8 and the plate is ginormous. Feeds 4 people easily.

I had the steak frites which was only $20 for a decent sized steak and cooked perfectly (medium rare). My friend had the seafood spaghetti which was delicious. The clams that came with it melted in our mouths! $18 for a decent sized pasta with tons of seafood. 

The place is usually quite packed. If you do try making reservations, it can be quite difficult to get a hold of them. It took us 6 calls throughout the week to finally reach them and make a reservation. Guess that tells you how popular the place is.

Definitely a go-to place if you ever crave some seaweed fries -- who would've thought that would be a crazy good combo?

Our waitress was attentive and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. Good place for a meal!"}
{"text":"Visited Shiso for the second time last week with my boyfriend.

The 1st time I went, lunch special was over and everything was very expensive (for an asian place).

2nd time I went last week, lunch special was available and it was much more fair on the price.
Portions were definately smaller but enough to be full as the regular entree portions are quite large.

Considering that it's in \"J town\", theres not a lot of Japanese incorporated with the menu other than the poutine selection.

We ordered the bolognese fries, my favourite out of all the others.
In my opinion, fries are fresh and taste like New York Fries to be honest, but the sauce is definately awesome!

Garlic bread that came with the pasta is delicious, salad is awesome as well, love the sauce.
(I rarely finish salads that are complimentary, but I ate all of this one)

Its a nice clean, quiet, classy place for lunch, definately recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Small Japanese shop in jtown. Menu is a mixture of Japanese/italian. Overall, food is mediocre and service is not bad.

I ordered the chicken nanban rice. It's size able for a lunch. It's like a chicken roulade (thigh) breaded and coated with teriyaki sauce and some tartar sauce. I'm not a fan of teriyaki sauce is generally because it's too sweet. The tartar sauce gives it an interesting kick. For 8-9 bucks it's worth trying for lunch. It also starts with a small salad.

My parents got the smoke salmon salad and smoke salmon pasta. These came with soups. I definitely wouldn't recommend these. Especially the pasta. The portions are a lot small, there's not a lot of smoke salmon in the pasta. Spaghetti is overlooked.

I didn't have it but the okonomayki fries looked good. I may come back to try that if I venture back to jtown again."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant a couple of times, and each time the food was great. This is the only Japanese-fusion restaurant I've been to. 

The place is a bit small, just as the name suggests it's a cafe. The first time I dined here it was just 2 of us, and everything from the service to the food was impressive. 

The last couple of visits though, were with a big family group which had some kids. We were given a limited menu of 8 pastas to chose from since we were more than 12 people... (12 adults, 3 kids) We were however, able to order the specials listed on their wall. 

The service was slower than normal, which was odd since the restaurant wasn't busy. The table we were situated at felt really crammed up against the window. Everyone's meal came out at different times, and mine came out the latest. I felt super rushed as the other half waited to order desserts.

The desserts were great, as they are freshly baked the bakeries next door. 

Would I return? Probably not.. Unless I was in the area looking for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place, a nice spot for Japanese style pasta. Only thing that holds me back from coming back so often is cause everything served here is all carbs.

Unagi-don Wafu Pasta ($17)
The pasta dish comes with salad and garlic bread. A creamy style terriyaki sauce pasta mixed with shimeji mushrooms, topped with bbq eel. This dish is perfect for cream sauce lovers - it is so rich in flavor. The bbq eel sauce mixed with the pasta sauce goes really well and tastes great mixed together. Really filling dish with all the pasta and carb overload.

Shrimp Okonomiyaki Wafu Pasta ($14)
The pasta dish comes with salad and garlic bread. Spaghetti sauteed with bacon, onions, and garlic dressed topped with shrimp, and okonomiyaki toppings as the sauce (homemade japanese steak sauce, mayo and bonito fish flakes). This dish was good, i felt like it could use more sauce though. Still tasty though!

You have the option of adding $8 to your pasta to get soup and a slice of cake, which I personally think it's not worth it since the Jtown bakery is just across the street and you can get a slice of cake for much cheaper.

Tried the Japanese poutine ($9) - do not get this. It is like just fries with gravy, nothing special. If anything you should try the okonomiyaki fries instead as it has more toppings and more flavor.

I've been seeing that they have a lunch menu now, going to come try sometime for lunch!"}
{"text":"Soo after a while bf & I decided to come back.. (yay!) The few times that we've been back here the pasta wasn't up to standard from what it used to be (sadface) BUT this time it was amazing again :') Hm, probably because the master chef Ken was cooking instead of his trusty sidekick. Lol!

We ordered 1 pasta set which comes with soup & cake for an additional $8 (WOW!) and one regular just pasta dish.

The soup was amazing as ever! Lovely soup (though I can't remember what it was called). I really loved how in all their soup it had a potatoey based soup - creamy and delicious..and filling too.

Dish #1 ($12) The smoked salmon a la creme vodka was delicious! Pasta was perfectly cooked just the way we liked it - al dente! Not too hard this time or too watery. It was nice & creamy.

Dish #2 ($14) Shrimp Okonomiyaki - interesting taste, the shrimp was full of flavour. When you bite into the shrimp you get a blast of flavour, yum! Yummy dish but I prefer a little less onions. 

As usual, all dishes come with salad to start and garlic bread with the pasta. I ordered the Green Tea Red Bean Cake (my fav but was too full to eat it so I packed it to go)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My recommended dishes: Unagi-Don, Smoked Salmon A La Creme Vodka, Tarako (I wonder if it's still on the menu?)

My recommended cakes: Rare Cheesecake, Green Tea Red Bean

**Definitely worth the extra $8 to upgrade to a pasta set..or even $3 to add a soup**"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the curry chicken and I got the unagi don. We also got the Japanese fries. 
There was a big leak through the ceiling so we got seated in the party area, but because of that service was not so good. The servers couldn't see us.

The curry chicken that Le BF got was delicious, it had a good amount of spice.

The unagi Don that I got was decent, it was weird how the rice was mixed with eggs? It had a creamy taste but I wouldn't order again. 

The Japanese fries are delicious , the cheese was melted just right .

Overall the portions are big and the food was decent. 
I could understand why other yelpers give negative ratings. 
The price doesn't justify the food, for that price the food was just normal"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It's nested in J-town but pasta wise i don't taste much fusion in it and service was not that great the day I went."}
{"text":"I visited because I was intrigued by the idea of Japanese pasta. Although the prices are very reasonable for pasta, I felt that mine was lacking in taste. I ordered the Shrimp Cream of Corn. There were exactly 4 shrimps in a shrimp pasta which was a few too little in my opinion. The sauce was unmemorable and the garlic bread was pretty much buttered toast. Also, the dish contained wood mushrooms which was not mentioned on the menu (I'm not allergic, but I don't like them). However, service was good and my friend enjoyed his meal. I would give them another chance, but definitely order a different dish."}
{"text":"Superb.

Excellent food and decor . I love how they added a touch of Japanese culture into the restaurant by letting you take off your shoes to sit.

Some must-haves would be the smoked salmon a la creme vodka. Some appetizers would be smoked salmon on garlic bread and tartar mayo fries. 

After trying Shiso Tree Cafe, you'll never want to eat pasta at another restaurant again. 8)"}
{"text":"I love LUNCH SPECIALS! Especially lunch specials at Shiso Tree Cafe.

I love Pasta and I love Japanese food! Pasta in Japanese style.... my kind of food!

Lunch Pasta set ($8)

Clam Chowder
- creamy without being overbearing and love those croutons
Garden Salad
- fresh and lightly dressed with miso based vinaigrette
Okonomiyaki Style Pasta
- Pasta cooked al dente with great bite
- Okonomiyaki sauce though a little disappointing as it is on the salty side and was quite over powering  

Dessert:

I didn't want to order the cake slices since I can get them from Bakery Nakamura next door, I ordered

Azuki Matcha Sundae ($ 4.50)
- I don't know what I was expecting? green tea ice cream?
- Vanilla Ice Cream+Red Bean+Fresh Whipped Cream+Matcha Syrup+Brown Sugar Rock Candy
- Beware of the Rocky Candy stuck to your teeth... :)

I will be back for their lunch specials and try out other pasta dishes....

I enjoyed the vibe at Shiso Tree Cafe especially in the afternoon as you can look out through the big windows...... and start day dreaming..........."}
{"text":"Lovely Japanese cafe with yummy coffee and motcha green tea cheesecake. Mango slush was great"}
{"text":"The Japanese take on comfort food and pasta is refreshing and very tasty. Everyone who has come here loves it. The nori fries and their other fries are super delicious. They have changed their menu a couple of times and each time it is still amazing"}
{"text":"I love this place and think it is a very interesting concept, what with the Japanese-Italian fusion thing going on! I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, and did not have to wait to be seated at a table. The cafe is super cute and cozy, and so are the staff, who are legitimately Japanese.

While I was there, I tried the shrimp okonomiyaki pasta and the nori fries. I really enjoyed my pasta, which was super flavourful and I thought it was very delicious. The okonomiyaki tasted very legit! :D

My lunch date ordered the smoked salmon a la creme vodka and wasn't a huge fan of the cream sauce, but thought that the dish was okay overall. We both agreed that the nori fries were fantastic!! It was also a huuuuge portion, so we had leftovers to take home.

It ended up being about $20 per person for lunch, but I think it was reasonable considering the amount of food we got. I would definitely come here again to try their other food, and also maybe their cakes/dessert next time! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Appetizer:
Fresh Greens with Miso Dressing! 
Cream of Corn Soup with Garlic Croutons

Entrée:
Tarake: Pasta with cod roe, garlic, shimeji mushroom garnished with nori and shiso. ($10)
Neapolitan: Japanese tomato sauce with bacon, sausage, and onions ($10) 
Sukiyaki: Japanese soy sauce based pasta with thinly sliced rib eye beef, enoki, king oyster, and shimeji mushroom

Dessert:
Mango and Strawberry Shortcake

There are some hits and misses at Shiso Tree Cafe. You can get soup, pasta and salad for $8 during lunch on the weekdays! :) Not a bad bargin at all! I will go back to try their dishes if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both experiences were different. The waiter for the first time was very nice and attentative. The second time I went, the waiter was rude and didn't care about us. We had to flag him down just to get some water for the table. 
Apparently you also can't bring in a cake (we went for a birthday dinner). They charge $2 per plate used if we were to eat the cake there. They didn't even offer to put the cake in the fridge either. We looked ridiculous having a cake on the table, but oh well. its probably since they also sell individual cakes.. 

The pasta is good, but I find that it's really heavy. I've tried it twice, and the flavors are always there. I always get the same one, the okonomiyaki pasta. The pasta is cooked to perfection, as al dente as it can get. There's no lack in sauce, it's just right. However, I find their pasta dishes to be really filling. It looks like a little bit of pasta, but once you start eating, you'll notice you get full really fast. 

The nori fries are okay. They look really good, but the fries just aren't crispy enough and there's also not enough dressing for them. 

I definitely like their cakes though, especially the cheesecake. It tastes exactly like the cheesecake I had in Japan. authentic!"}
{"text":"This place is okay.. Nothing special. The place is located inside Jtown. You have to go up a few steps to get there. They open at 12 every day i believe. 

The food was okay.. Nothing really appealed to me. I ordered the Sukiyaki which was noodles in soy sauce and mushrooms and beef with garlic toast. This comes with a house salad. Unfortunately if you want to have a soup, salad, garlic bread and cake (pasta set), you have to pay and extra $7.  The salad was pretty good. The soup was awesome. It was cauliflower cream soup. It was yummy. The croutons were a bit too salty for my liking. The pasta came and it was that great. I don't know why but it just doesn't look good and didn't taste good.. The toast like other people said, doesn't really taste like garlic bread. It was lacking some taste. THe cake came from the Bakery Nakamura. I knew the cake was very good as I always buy cakes from the bakery. 

The service was okay.. I think 1 waitress wasn't doing much. I felt like both of the waitresses could have done more. The one that kept on serving us was fine but the other one needed some more training. The one that served us was very smart. As my family and I only ordered 1 pasta set, we only had 1 piece of cake. The waitress gave us 4 forks in total so we could all share it."}
{"text":"Really nice little cafe nestled in J-Town with a unique fusion of Japanese and Italian. We had the fries and they were fantastic as well as the pasta.  I don't think you can go wrong here.  Food is a comforting blend of two cultures and the service is attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"They offer fairly cheap lunch specials Mon to Fri; however, lunch menu is quite limited and many popular items are not available during lunch time on weekdays. 
Pasta is $8 and comes with small soup, salad and a slice of garlic bread.  Soup tasted kinda like diluted pasta, I didn't really like the soup. I had Okonomoyaki pasta which was good, interesting flavour; good blend of Japanese flavour and pasta. Bolognese Pasta was just ok.
Curry chicken Katsu was $10 and came with a salad; it was good but not amazing. 
I would have liked to try wafu  seafood pasta but only available for dinner.  

Lunch menu was cheap but nothing amazing. You can add coffee or tea to lunch special for an extra $1.5. Coffee came with free refills but quite weak and diluted taste."}
{"text":"I know a lot of my friends like to go all the time but although I go to J-Town all the time, it was only a few weeks ago that I finally went to try Shiso Tree Cafe. It's where Japan meets Italy where pasta are incorporated with Japanese flavors.

There was a drum set, I assume there's live performance at night?!

  For an additional $7, you can upgrade your pasta to a set with Soup of teh day, Salad , garlic toast and a slice of cake.

 Since we were only there for Lunch, we skipped the combo but our pasta still came with a salad

  Nori Fries $6
~ fresh cut fries tossed with homemade Wafu dressing & Japanese Seaweeds
~ This tasted amazing, definitely a lot better than I expected with the flavorful. The nori was very crispy and fresh which is you would think it's among the definition of nori but you would be surprise at how many places have them soggy which makes it incredibly difficult to tear through when it's in bigger sheets. Love how they left the fries skin on and was very crispy and was perfect with the touch of Wafu dressing

  Shiso Clam Vingole $15
~ White Wine, Olive Oil, garlic, bacon, tomato, fresh Manila calms & shiso
~ I really love their presentation but thought it look a tad try but once we dig in, we realize that it was perfect. Light and refreshing with the prefect amount of flavor and need I mention that the garlic toast was perfect (^_^). But I have to say the clams weren't the freshest.

  Shrimp Okonomiyaki $14
~ Spaghetti sauteed w/ bacon, onions, garlic dressed shrimp, homemade steak sauce, Japanese mayo & bonito fish flakes
~ Don't you just love bonito flakes, it'll move when sprinkle on top of hot dishes.... unlike the clams, the shrimp here was a lot better and the flavor here is a touch more intense than the previous one with a slight tang to it probably from the Japanese mayo.


  Black Sesame Creme Brulee $6
~This was from the Special on the black board and this was just so good that I would come back in a heartbeat just for this. I have gotten over creme brulee and tend not to order it, but I'm always attracted to special flavor like this one (remember the Jackfruit one I had here)
~The sugar crust was just perfect although the black sesame doesn't make it the best looking but it tasted define. The custard itself wasn't overly sweet and packed a ton of black sesame flavor 


 Verdict :
Although I love their pasta, I find it a tad overprice and for a guy, it wouldn't be enough for dinner.
But I would probably go back since it's so close by to our place and also just for the creme brulee"}
{"text":"I'm really happy I discovered this place, the food is delicious and the prices are quite reasonable. It is a bit difficult to find as I drove by it twice wondering if my GPS was wrong. We just came for desserts and had the matcha crepe and two of their specialty teas. The crepe was very tasty, not overly sweet and generously sized. I'm looking forward to coming back here for lunch as the group beside us were having some pasta and it looked and smelled fantastic."}
{"text":"One of a handful of authentic Japanese-run restaurants in Toronto. Exceptional food and service! Expect to pay around as much as Boston Pizza or Kelsey's but receive much better quality of food. Their soup is great to try as well!

Side note: I left something at the restaurant and they kept it for me and allowed me to come in past the restaurant hours to pick it up, so thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with my parents and noticed a new entry on the specials.  Lobster Spaghetti with Homard Lobster,  San Marzam tomato sauce, fresh Mozzarella and fresh basil.

Although the price is normally out of my normal range, I did want to try out something new.

The salad and toast sides are still standard, but good quality.

When I was eating it, I felt it had to be my No.3 choice of pasta in that restaurant.  The No.1 and No.2 choices being my usuals: Shrimp Okonomiyaki Pasta and Napolitan respectively.

The taste of of the tomatoes made a difference, it was like tasting cherry tomato sweetness with the sauce rather than the harsh tart taste of normal tomato sauce.  The lobster was given in relatively generous chunks in relation to the size of the dish.

As I was nearing the end of eating it, I had to say I think if I had the money this would be my No.2 choice, displacing the Napolitan.

However, shortly after I finished the dish, there was a bit of a pang in my mouth that was feeling happiness.  So now I think this is my No.1 choice.  However, it could be just that I was craving lobster at the time.

Unfortunately, the $24 price tag is a bit of a turn off for me, but if you have more disposable income I would say go for it.  Well more worth it than Casa Imperial."}
{"text":"I adore Shiso Tree Cafe.  Especially since it's the only Japanese pasta restaurant that I know of here and, as crazy as it sounds, I almost like it better than authentic pasta. :P

I've been back multiple times and have loved everything - the okonomiyaki pasta, the sukiyaki beef pasta, the bacon and clams...I don't think I've had anything there that I don't like. I wish they still served tarako though!  The soups and bread are also nice.  Best of all, if you order a combo, you get a slice of cake from the bakery next door, which is delicious!  

Presentation of the food is always lovely and the service is always reliably good.  This is one of my favourite places and I wish I still lived closer to here!"}
{"text":"Shiso Tree Cafe offers very little food selection with a hefty price tag but one can argue that the quality of the dishes and the atmosphere of the restaurant makes up for the expensiveness. The staff were very quiet and polite.

I did not think the descriptions of the pasta on the menu helped describe the taste to the fullest extent. I ordered two different types randomly because they all seemed similar and was surprised at the taste of them. Just not for everyone. The cake seemed to come from the Nakamura bakery right across from the restaurant. It was delicious.

The biggest problem I have with the restaurant is the value for money. For me, the price does not justify the food. I know others will not hesitate to disagree with me."}
{"text":"The bf and I were due to make cat food on Tuesday so we decided to stop by Japan Town (J-Town) for dinner before heading over to T&T. We obviously bought some buns home and headed to Shiso Tree Cafe. I was not in the mood for ramen and he didn't want to go to an Izakaya so...

 Pretty simple menu with apps, bread, salads, fries, and pasta. Not only do they serve regular pasta you'll find at a pasta place (notice how I didn't say Italian) but they also serve Wafuu(??) pasta. Basically it's Japanese style pasta or rather, pasta with Japanese ingredients.

The meal came with a salad that...neither of us touched.

First, we tried their Okonomiyaki fries that were raved about on BlogTO. Although, I don't particularly agree with their blog reviews most of the time, I would have to say that I second their opinion on these fries. They are delicious. It's basically Okonomiyaki but on fries instead of cabbage.


This attached image is a half portion of the Shrimp Okonomiyaki Pasta. Well, it also tasted like Okonomiyaki but with more garlic (more punch), shrimp, and well... of course, pasta! It was pretty good! Very different.
We were originally planning on having the fries and pasta as a snack so they were nice enough to divide it into two portions. We were both full by the time we were done.

If you're around the area, I would definitely recommend that you try it but if you live downtown or somewhere even further away....well...if you want to. There are Japanese style poutines much closer to you. If anything, J-Town is definitely worth a visit. Sure, you can find a lot of the items there at other Asian supermarkets at a cheaper price but there are some Japanese items you can only buy at J-Town. They also have a lot of buns, and delicious bread to choose from. And the cakes!!!!"}
{"text":"Shiso Tree Cafe is located in J-Town by Steeles/Woodbine. It is essentially fusion Italian and Japanese food. The pastas on the menu are unique in terms of the ingredients used as many of the pastas include ingredients like nori, eel, etc. 

I've gone here numerous times and I've always been a fan of the unique flavours and consistency of Shiso Tree. The pastas are perfectly al dente everytime and the fries are delicious. 

This is definitely a place one has to try! 

I recently had the lunch special and for $8 you get soup, salad, and a smaller portion of pasta. Great small lunch for if you're around the area."}
{"text":"J Town is a little plaza full of little Japanese restaurants and shops. Very small plaza but I am able to find a parking spot the three times I came here!

Shiso Tree Cafe is a very cute place. Through the door that gets stuck with strong winds, you are greeted with heavy quilt curtains. To your right are shoes that belong to the people in the booth -with zashiki style seating (low table, no shoes).

You will then be greeted by a waitress and be taken to your table.

Firstly you must know that it is BOTTOMLESS refills on hot tea and coffee. That's amazing in an Asian place! Also, I want to say ALL (but it could just be MOST?) of their teas are from David's Tea (LOL)

Tea/Coffee prices: $2-4

I prefer to visit here during the afternoon for teas and fries. I didn't quite like the pasta dinners. This is a Japanese/Italian fusion, they make spaghetti and pasta dishes with Japanese influences. I love the creativity but it doesn't taste as good as I hoped. The fries are still good though! And it's a very nice date spot for afternoons."}

_______________

Tucked in the official \"J-town\" is a Japanese/Italian fusion cafe. I've been to Shiso Tree Cafe twice in two years and can say it's certainly a unique gem in Markham! One of the only restaurant that does \"authentic\" Japanese fusion food. (\"authentic\" because some people may argue that fusion isn't authentic) Let me explain myself - Shiso Tree offers a blend of Japanese and Italian pastas and rice dishes. With every bite, I could taste the influences from both cultures - from the fresh Italian pasta to the sweet and creamy Japanese sauces.

I went back a second time because I found myself CRAVING their Nori and Okonomiyaki fries. These hand-cut, golden, crispy fries are tossed with homemade Wafu dressing & Japanese seaweed (Nori) and dressed with homemade steak sauce, Japanese mayo, bonito fish flakes & green onions. Although there is nothing unconventional about these Japanese ingredients, it is uncommon to have them on fries and definitely a fresh alternative to good ol' ketchup.

The service is incredible here - the wait staff are so kind to explain the menu items. The restaurant itself is a little small so I would recommend getting a reservation for Friday and Saturday nights. I went with a table of four on a Friday night and we had to wait ~30 minutes for a table. The restaurant's location is a little out of the way if you don't drive. It is near the highway, but not really accessible by public transit. However, it is in \"J-Town\" so there are a couple delicious Japanese bakeries and supermarkets in the plaza to explore!

Verdict? I would recommend Shiso to anyone who wants to try Japanese/Italian fusion food. However, if you don't live in the area, I wouldn't go on a mission to go there right away as there are other options downtown!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat for their lunch menu. The prices range from $8-$12 and depending on what you get it also comes with soup or salad. I like to come here to get their specialty fries because they give really huge portions! We ordered the okonomiyaki fries and it was very good in my opinion. I don't particularly enjoy the pasta though, I feel like it's not worth it for such a small amount and the flavour is pretty bland as well. I tried their eel rice and that was okay. The eggs were a bit too buttery and it would have been better if there was more eel sauce on top. I would not recommend coming here during dinner since the prices are higher than the lunch menu. It does not get too busy during lunch either. It opens right at noon so you can easily get seated and eat quickly if you're just out during lunch break."}
