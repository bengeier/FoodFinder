{"text":"Man, the kids are harsh these days. 

Paddock is kind of an institution. Used to be busier, but, things that it has going for it: a) ambience. The dark interior and the art deco touches. The long bar. b) The Steak Frites. This is an awesome steak frites. Maybe in league with Deluxe's... kid you not. You can have 2 martinis and the steak frites and pretend you're Don fucking Draper. c) Manhattan, see below. d) Live jazz on occasion.

Those \"80s hooker hold over\"s happen to be real Queen W servers. I know at least one lives in the neighborhood. And she makes the best Manhattan around. Just 'cause they don't kiss your ass doesn't mean they're not doing a good job. But the Paddock is not a \"lets get the kids liquored up and laid\" kinda place anyway.

Issues: yeah the washroom is that bad. Also front door doesn't close properly and in winter it can be a pain."}
{"text":"The Paddock Tavern is one of those classic places in Toronto that you would love to stop in and share a pint with friends. The interior has the classic wood and leather combo of old taverns. They won't sell you a bottled beer so domestic fans beware. Live acts are often found here on the weekends that liven the place up with a great blues vibe."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken and after eating a couple bites from the outside realized it was still totally raw and *cold* in the middle.  Gross."}
{"text":"Recently came here for summerlicious ($25) last Friday night with some friends and when we arrived, the place was pretty much empty.. which is pretty alarming when you first try out a new restaurant.

Like some other restaurants in the area, this place does not offer a drinks menu. But you would have thought that you can just name a drink and they will make it for you. Wrong. The drink options are very limited and I ended up closing a local beer which was about $8.

The food was a hit and miss. Overall the portions were pretty generous, but the quality of food was very inconsistent, especially dessert. The Grilled cheese bites (appetizer) was the best of the 3 courses. The Pan fried crab cakes (main) was a bit burnt and covered with too much bread crumbs. The Coffee caramel creme brulee (dessert) was probably the worst, it pretty much just came out from the fridge- the entire dessert was still cold.

In terms of ambience, the interior could use some work. The place is very dull and dim. The patio would have been a big selling point, if they had set up the space for outdoor seating instead of it just being a smokers pit. 

Service was not the best either. Our server who was also the bar tender could use a bit of a cheer me up. He lacked enthusiasm and a smile which I personally think is key for the food service industry. Who wants to see a Debby Downer when you are out to have a good time?"}
{"text":"This may or may not be the most objective review since I am currently three sheets to the wind.

The Paddock is about what you'd expect from a tiny, not quite hole in the wall spot that used to be owned by Jeff Healey. It's next door to the Basement which you would know if you were a 90s raver in Toronto. Neither of those things are positives but for some reason the Paddock kinda pulls it off.

It's small, the bathrooms are ridiculously small to the point of people peeing on each other just to get at a urinal and the drink service is hit or miss depending on what 80s hooker hold over you've managed to flag down acknowledges you. Through all of that, somehow, it sort of pulls off an unpretentious cool vibe and I don't understand how.

If you're looking for a standard \"get it in ya and get drunk\" bar, then this isn't a bad place. The drinks are reasonably priced and it can be just as much a dance party as it can a small quiet place to have a pint. It really seems to depend entirely on who shows up at the time.

I'll hit it up again to see how it is on a night that a birthday party and \"retro-90s\" dance party aren't happening and let you know how it goes."}
{"text":"What a great old school joint. Always different and interesting beer on tap and great tasting food.  Come for the beer stay for the music."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for dinner on a Friday night. Typical bar-type food, nothing too special. I like the simplified menu variety of beer available. It's apparently the 3rd oldest bar in the city which makes you appreciate the charming atmosphere. Great location and friendly service."}
{"text":"The Paddock is Toronto's 3rd oldest bar. That in itself is enough reason to go visit, but their beer selection makes it worthwhile too. See my pic of the German Hopf beer on tap which was sampled and it was delicious and fresh. The history of the Paddock is illustrious and colourful, alive with Toronto spirit and decadence. The decor is dark wood, mysterious and rich in tone and feel. It's not a large space, but well proportioned and airy, despite being dark. There are two large TV screens, on adjacent walls, so it would be a good place to watch a game. The bartender was friendly and had some great tunes playing on his iTunes computer. It's off the beaten tourist path of Queen St. West and well worth the small detour south of the Pizza joint on the corner."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a bustling place, with lots of people to mingle with, this space isn't really for you. If you are looking for charming place with the odd character propped up at the bar, this may just become your local. There will never be a line up as it's usually quite empty so you are sure to get a cozy booth or table in mere moments. 

The atmosphere is dark and mysterious and reminds me of a classic old hollywood film. The food there isn't your average pub food but quite tasty. (I really enjoy the crab cakes and the fries and Garlic Sauce) 

If you need a space to meet up for pre-drinks or to catch up with friends, I would highly suggest this joint."}
{"text":"Was here last Friday for drinks and dinner with my husband.  Surprisingly - the food was quite good!

It's not the nicest / cleanest / posh place - being the 3rd oldest bar in Toronto or something like that....but I was impressed with the service and the food.  It was a positive atmosphere.

Food was a tad slow though although my partner thought it was okay. Maybe I was just really hungry.

I had the vegetarian lasagna (generous portion and quite delicious) and my husband had the beef stew - he said it was yummy!

We also shared the Wasabi hummus which was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I should love this bar. I love booze and I love nostalgia. But the general lack of patrons actually makes me uneasy.

I've often stopped in for a last drink of the night on my way home and there really isn't much of a scene.

Why isn't this place more fun?"}
{"text":"Good rustic vibe. Interesting but narrow tap selection. Good and service was pretty good. Played the footy = good."}
{"text":"this place is just sad. It has nothing going on and  limited drink choices. It took an hour and half for our food to arrive and it was a joke. the gnocci were huge hard squares of potatoes, the jalapeño poppers were 3 large jalapeños too hot to actually eat... don't worry, our server warned us... AFTER we order and he had served them to us, and the grilled cheese bites were melted cheese on a hard crostini cracker. and it wasn't even cheap, it was quite expensive for what we got. sad."}
{"text":"Over the many years of frequenting the Queen & Bathurst, I've always been curious about this place. Well last week I had a chance to stop in for dinner and drinks and I have to say I was pretty pleased with the experience. 

One thing this place has going for it is its beer selection. They seem to have a decent variety, but I was most impressed in the fact they have Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell on tap.
As for food, the prices aren't the best and they aren't using the highest grade ingredients but the actual end product was good enough to still seem worthwhile. 
The apps are all in the $7-10 range. We had the artichoke and spinach dip with chips and these neat meatballs wrapped in wine leaves, and as a main I had a spinach and feta stuffed chicken breast with a side of caesar salad and basmati rice ($18). It was all perfectly adequate. Nothing to write home about, but good enough to warrant a 3 star review and no complaints.

When we arrived, around 7:30, the place was pretty much empty. As we finished up closer to 8:30, the place started to fill up with a few groups of people. The music playing was a mix of classic rock, funk, and soul at a good volume.  The interior is well aged but that kind of goes with the vibe the place puts off with its long L shaped bar. The bathrooms definitely show their age.

In the end, glad I got a chance to cross the place off the list and if killing time and looking for a place to have a cold pint, I'll probably come back."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and clean. Intimate lighting. Classy. Nice selection of GOOD beers, excellent food. Overall, a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay, this bar is the smelliest bar I have ever been in the world.  We went there on Oct 15 to see shows during Indie Week. It was before 10 pm and when I walked into the bar, I could immediately smell the stench of pee wafting through the air. The closer you are to the restroom, the stronger the odor. My male friend went to the restroom and he can't stand  at all. The floor was covered with sticky fluids. Unbelievable ! Shock ! This bar is in the city of Toronto, the third biggest city in North America."}
{"text":"Wandered into this spot for drinks (and drinks only) after dinner on a Friday night. It's a bit muddy in there; dim lighting, not too loud, and everything's got the faintest touch of, let's call it, \"history.\" But it's charming in an art deco kind of way, and I can imagine a lot of mysterious trysts have transpired under the Paddock's roof. Probably a few mob hits too.

Although there is ample seating at their tables, you'll want to pony up to the expansive bar. The L-shaped beast has to be at least 30 feet long, with old-school stools that swivel, and super-friendly bartenders who are quick to suggest a decent shot. They seemed to have a lot of beers on tap (I'd guess 10) including Big Rock, so I was a fan. Don't really know what drinks cost, but it seemed reasonable for the locale.

This place has a vibe that suggests almost anything can go down in this place. With a small patio out front, I see potential.

Obligatory Title Pun: Give this DOCtor a spin.

Menu Readability: Like I said, drinks and drinks only. I'll come back and report.

Need to mention: Pretty small washroom, brah. Don't go if you value privacy.

What this place teaches me about myself: I might look good in a fedora. No, probably not."}
{"text":"This is one of Toronto's oldest bars - I believe it's been around for 70 years or so.

We came here for a Saturday night of live music (aBabe) and drinks with friends. The line up was eclectic but interesting... (I personally would have organized the three bands slightly differently but that has nothing to do with the bar... I digress) 

Anyway, they advertised a diverse beer selection, which didn't turn out to be that big, but a good selection of local and specialty brews none-the-less. The beers were all $8, except for the Hogtown pale ale which was $7 - I believe they are aBabe's sponsor.

We didn't eat, but I'm curious to come back and try their oysters one Tuesday night. The bathrooms were so cold it felt like you were peeing outside. Decor was dark and moody but not dingy. Service wasn't bad but neither bartenders smiled even once so I also wouldn't call it friendly.

All in all, an okay place. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so either."}
