{"text":"I went to this a few years ago - after working late - the lady could hardly speak English - so today  I ventured back - well the new guy took my order right away no problem, my order came out rather quickly it surprised me, so I sat down and enjoyed it  - smelled great and was clean and nicely presented - all for about 8 bucks - it appears alot of people like this place because there was always new customer s coming in to pick up there orders 
Friendly and great service  - I would recommend this place for an easy meal after work or a casual meal with a friend."}
{"text":"From what I've heard (from friends and co workers) their food used to be delicious and a great deal price wise. Went there once and will never go back. Friends all agree that their quality has dropped.  The stir fry was bland, rice was over cooked and onion rings were really greasy and had a strange taste. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"This used to be the best food for Chinese in etobicoke years ago, now I think it may be the worst.  New ownership can only explain the bad food.  Poor quality of ingredients, wings tasted bitter a total waste of money.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Should have yelped before going here and I feel so bad for anyone who doesn't. I paid over 33$ for tax and delivery for three combination plates! Overpriced and DISGUSTING! I figured for the price it would be good but it's probably the most disgusting food, I called back to ask them to take it back and give me a refund, and they started yelling at me! They literally made me cry my eyes out saying they went to check my food and the quality was fine and that I was lying! He yelled at my husband when he tried to call back to demand a refund, it was so absolutely disgusting... I've never been so upset in my life. The rice was undercooked and hard, the food was overly greasy, Kung pao chicken more like pepper chicken, it was absolutely disgusting!! I've never been so upset in my life! The egg rolls tasted like cat food, and the chop seuy had mushrooms which is odd and never actually used in a chicken cop seuy. When I call the man screams at me and tells me that he won't give me my money back they've been there for 30 years and I should respect them for that, I honestly wanted to go to his restaurant and throw the food at him! I couldn't believe what he had said to me, absolute ignorance, the customer is ALWAYS right, we are the owners of a very successful gourmet food truck and understand the value of customer service. This was just so disappointing, I bawled my eyes out."}
{"text":"I just got my food delivered and I ordered the mango chicken and pineapple fried rice, the mango chicken was disgusting it was RAW! I called them to let them know that I had raw chicken and that could be food poisoning and the manager went on the phone and he told me that it was impossible and I am like sir I am looking at it right now and its raw..its slimy and pink and he's like no raw is red, best I can do is give you a $12 credit but its weird mango chicken is supposed to be like that, thats how people like it. I didn't know people liked raw mango chicken and since when is raw chicken red?"}
{"text":"This is more like DOG FOOD!!! I ordered for the first time tonight and it tasted like it had half spoiled ingredients mixed in with fresh.  I am praying my little girl does not get sick from the shrimp she tried before I could taste it. it tasted bad.  DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.  A waste of $50!!! Hopefully we will feel okay tomorrow."}
{"text":"Really like going to Golden wok. Always fresh. The lady serving you is so polite. The prices for the combos are amazing. Cantonese chow mein is off the hook."}
{"text":"I have not returned to Golden Wok for a long time because I have noticed the quality has basically dropped of a cliff but recently my mom ordered take out and had us over for dinner.  

I am 100% convinced that they are precooking/cooking fried certain fried food and then reheating it or not and then just packing it up and sending it out.  Typically in the past their fried dishes are hot, very hot, steaming hot, crispy and not dry.  Take your pick, chicken balls, wings etc.  The wonton seemed freshly fried but absolutely not the crispy spicy beef which used to be our favorite dish.

How do I know this?  As I have been saying we've been going here since this place opened decades ago.  

Between the chicken soo guy and the \"crispy\" spicy beef these dishes used to be hallmark mainstays and are now hard, dry and rock hard.  This is a HUGE disappointment considering maybe not even half a year ago the freshness and quality was basically as it was for so many years.

I am sad to say I will not go back to Golden Wok and for me personally it is sad because I've been going here for so long it's like saying good bye to an old friend."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here for years. Pricing is reasonable, staff is always pleasant and polite, the combo plates are a great deal.

General Tao chicken is amazing! Get it every time I order from there!"}
{"text":"My son plays basketball across the street, from the outside I wouldn't normally try this place, tried it once; been back numerous times.  Food is good, great portions, value.  Staff is easy going, friendly.  I didn't enjoy the won-ton at all, but otherwise all positive!"}
{"text":"The prices, service and food here are all swell! It's a tiny joint with hand drawn signs and crappy little chairs, which makes it kind of cute. The staff are very friendly and attentive.

Last time I came, I ordered a lunch special that came with stir-fried vegetables, sweet and sour chicken balls, and a mound of vegetable fried rice. Twas all scrumptious.

Portion sizes are generous, so you will leave here with a full belly AND wallet. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time for lunch. I have recently changed offices and my usual Chinese restaurant is a fair distance away by car. 

I ordered the fried rice noodles with beef and bean sprouts. I was pleased that his place had it on the menu. It was tasty. The beef was a bit tough, at times, but it wasn't the case with every bite. 

The place is cramped. I managed to get a seat, but it can be busy. The parking lot is crazy, thanks to the Tim Horton's. My friend had a chicken dish with a lot of mixed vegetables and cashews. He actually got confused eating it because there was far too much going on with his dish and said that he wouldn't try it again. 

It's unfortunate that there isn't soup that comes with the lunch meal. I'd give this place four stars if it did."}
{"text":"It's not often that I write a Yelp review within mere minutes of eating however I must break with tradition for this. I ordered a dish of \"Szechuan Noodles\" as part the regular Friday lunch order we do in my office. Having never tried this place, I figured I'd give it a go. What a mistake. My Szechuan Noodles were nothing more than plain chow-mein noodles with some kind of tasteless clear sauce with chilies and half-cooked onions/beansprouts. Three bites and the rest went in the garbage. This is by far the worst Chinese food I ever ate (including food courts and small-town restaurants). As a Yelper I should have listened to all the bad reviews this place received and just avoided it all together. On a side-note, not many people who joined in on the order were pleased with what they received. Based on the pictures/reviews of this place, it looks like they don't even try to put out a quality product. 

Avoid this place at all costs. The Tim Hortons in the same plaza would be a more flavourful and better choice (I'm serious)."}
