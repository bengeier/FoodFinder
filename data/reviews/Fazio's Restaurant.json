{"text":"We had a reservation for tonight, Valentines Day, for the very first sitting at 4. When we got there they didn't have us on the list of reservations, though we called twice in advance to arrange and confirm. When we called in advance, they said they would offer both their regular menu and a V-day special menu. Their website said the same thing. We prefer the regular menu, as those special menus have way too much food.  When we got there we were the only ones aside from something weird going on with an old man who they turned away.   Anyway, we sat there a while. Turns out, they would not honor what they said on the phone, and what was still on their website, which my husband showed them from his phone (it was, and probably still is, on their website) - they would not honor the normal menu. But WAIT - it gets worse. The special menu wasn't ready, and while we waited, they were supposedly printing it. Really? 15 minutes into a V-day sitting, and you still have no menu? We waited and waited, and finally realized this was a cluster-f in the making.  We left. The place sucks. We went up the street to Suds Maguire and it was wonderful :-)"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the others are talking about. My boyfriend and I went here the week before Valentine's day. It was delicious!!! I had the braised short rib mac and cheese and he had the stuffed burger, we also got the short rib appetizer. The service was great and the food was wonderful. They also had great martinis!  We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I am writing a update because I stated previously in my earlier review of Fazios I would give it one more chance...I'm just that kinda gal. Well came in with a couple girlfriends after our workout to grab a relaxing brunch. Hoping and HOPING that since they have a new chef the food (along with listening to the review I wrote-I mean constructive criticism is the best form for change right?!) would be so much better. By the looks of the new menu, I was optimistic. It looked as if they took time to revamp the layout of the menu and have it \"feel\" as if you were eating somewhere where the chef is going to deliver great food...like food that was described as read. So I ordered my egg white veggie omelet and had specified cooking with no butter or oil -last time I ordered this, my healthy egg whites were swimming in oil. Here is a clue. When someone specifies egg whites it is 90% of the time that person eating clean or healthy-it should not come out swimming in oil..we specifically took the fat part out of the egg for a reason.  I also had them keep the hash browns so I can compare and again ordered wheat toast to see if it was still out of the bag bread like last time. There is a pastry chef here correct? My girlfriends both ordered the crusted French toast.  Coffee was an improvement, it was good and our waitress-same as last time kept refilling which was nice. Lots of girl talk and food came. My omelet was prepared dry which is what I wanted but was so tiny! I mean egg whites kinda have to be tripled, I honestly think they used two egg whites...so 40 calories. I guess that's good if you want to start your morning off after an hour of ass kicking workout with 40 calorie tiny egg whites....oh well I got the protein I needed. The hash browns like last time looked so unappetizing. Grayish brown. Soft and kinda looked soggy. I tasted a bite. No thanks. No flavor, no crunch nothing! On to my toast. Oh sweet eeehhhhh sandpaper toasted BAGGED toast! I can not stand bagged bread at a restaurant, I'm sorry am I not the only one? I again could have made this breakfast 10000 x's better in my kitchen. So disappointed. My friends French  toast (bagged toast) was so heavily crusted in cornflakes and thin...because bagged bread was used for French toast that is was eating sandpaper and greasy greasy sandpaper. Why not use French baguette or a specialty bread!? I am so confused and they were not impressed. One more thing, when you say breakfast comes with a fruit salad I expect a fruit salad not two orange slices on my already bland colored plate. Needless to say I picked up the tab because I love my girlfriends and I suggested this place...I wanted to take the financial hit not them.   I can sadly say this restaurant seems as if they will cater to the 50 something lounge crowd that likes the hair band music, beer, and mediocre( at best ) food. I do not fit that crowd. I know my food. I know great food. I am part of the revolution of 30 something's who will expect restaurants to deliver taste, presentation and blow us all away. I get that and expect just that when I go out...now I know for sure I'm just not going to get it here."}
{"text":"i was excited to see a new restaurant take over the old quince spot in olmsted falls, i am not  excited any longer. where to start? had a couple of apps, stuffed banana peppers and a fondue plate.....peppers were good, tasty sauce but the fondue? like melted cheese whiz served with a couple of chunks of bread. menu LOOKS good but doesn't deliver......had the duck salad ($12) overcooked hunks of brown meat on a greasy, oily salad that had not one drop of acid. the only thing redeeming about the salad was the big chunk of fried goat cheese. one of our guests ordered salmon, close to the food being served she was told that they would sub out mahi for the salmon, my guest stated that it was not ok and ordered the trout, which she said was ok. a table nearby ordered the mahi and boy was it ripe.....the air thick with ammonia floated over burning our noses......i had a cherry braised short rib with potato galette. the potato was SO good, but the meat, dried out, leathery and tough. a manager explained that the short ribs are stored in a juice  and the piece i had must have been exposed to the air that's why it was dry. at least the manager tried to be nice. when the served asked me how it was i told her that it was dried and she totally dismissed me and quickly turned around, everybody at our table noticed how rude she was. she was also a mediocre server at best.....every plate of food was auctioned off, yelling out \"who gets the......\"; shameful! never was a piece of silverware replaced, she neatly picked your fork off of your plate at placed it back on the table.  a garage band was belting out freedom rock songs upstairs while a \"girls gone wild party\" was in full force nearby.........i would never recommend this restaurant, except to recommend that you stay away.....too bad, i had high hopes."}
