{"text":"WHO DAT, DAT MADE DAT? Cause daaaaamn, that's good! 
I was at a Super Bowl party yesterday. You know, the one where the New Orleans SAINTS took the win? 

I had a taste of this restaurants catering job, a job well done! 

The Jambalaya was delicious. It was the New Orleans style of course tossed with rice....awesome. The craw fish bread and the Creole style gumbo lulu were also delicious. Of course they did not forget to order the bread pudding, also delicious. 

Yay! I'm a fan based on this catering and look forward to eating their food again. 

p.s. The food tasted just as good sober as it did after a few drinks. Everyone seemed to loved it, even the Colts fans in the room! 
Glad something made them happy last night .HA! HA!"}
{"text":"The concept of this restaurant is that you pull prepared and pre-packaged foods from a cooler.  You can take it home to reheat and eat or they have a microwave on site and several tables, if you prefer to eat there.  I asked the lady working there if it still taste restaurant quality.  Her response was \"yes, but it is like taking food home from a restaurant and heating it up later\".  That was such a turn off!

We purchased Mac n cheese, potato salad, cake and the super sweet \"strango\" drink.  I was considering buying a bigger meal just to try the items but changed my mind for several reasons.  
1)  Collard greens were mostly stems....like, 65% or more.
2)  The fish that is used in the \"fish with crawfish cream sauce\" dish is swai.  Swai is a fish that is native to Vietnam.  I try to avoid eating this type of fish because there have been so many recalls due to inspection violations.  I never feel safe eating it.  Feel free to Google this.
3)  There were several types of wings there, but they were $6 for 4 or 5 little wing dings.....that require reheating.  A 10 piece at Wingstop is $8, fresh, hot and crispy.
4) Plain and simple, if I am going to spend  $50 on a family dinner from a restaurant, there are plenty of options that are fresh and hot.  I could even do Olive Garden To Go for that price.

Anyway, we reheated the food at home.  It would have been nice to have heating instructions for each item so that we know that we are eating them the way that the chef intended or at least a date when the items were prepared, so that I know how fresh they are/aren't.  The mac n cheese was ok.  Lots of roux, not much cheese.  We loved the flavor of the cakes.  They were a little dry (possibly from a few days in the cooler) but still delish. 

I do not plan to revisit this restaurant.  The concept seems pretty cool, but the high prices and lower quality of ingredients that are used, did not leave me feeling inspired or wanting more.  It made me feel like I was eating leftovers from someone else's doggy bag.  Biting my tongue is never a great thing and this restaurant has not changed that for me."}
{"text":"All the negative reviews were about a restaurant. This is not a restaurant. It is take out of the highest quality and the best Cajun food I have had outside New Orleans and even most NO restaurants. My favorites are the fish with crab/shrimp sauce and the seafood gumbo."}
{"text":"I'd love to give Bite Your Tongue 5 stars. I'd love to say the food was fantastic. But I can't. I've heard great things about the food at this place from some friends that are from New Orleans so I was really excited to check this place out. We arrived at 7:00pm, there were a few empty tables, and we were seated right away. The girl that sat us took our drink order, returned with our drinks, and that was the end of any type of service. After sitting with our menus for 15 plus minutes, we finally got up and left. Very disappointing. The restaurant wasn't even busy, and the place is small. How we could be overlooked for over 15 minutes is almost unbelievable. We may give this place another try, but it would only be for takeout. At least the Chinese food we got instead was good and serves promptly. If it was possible to give zero stars I would have."}
{"text":"Huge fan, and the owners have such an amazing back story! :) Ask them about it!"}
{"text":"As a Louisiana native living in Charlotte, Bite Your Tongue has the best gumbo in Charlotte.  I've enjoyed their jambalaya, red beans and bread pudding as well.  My only complaint is that they are not open in the evening.  If you like cajun food, you definitely have to try Bite Your Tongue."}
{"text":"I just ate here 2 weeks ago and I recommended it to friends visiting this weekend.  They went there on Friday afternoon and said the place looked closed----as in out of business!  I tried calling the restaurant on Saturday, but did not get an answer.  The food is/was great, so I hope they are still in business."}
{"text":"Incredible.  Not only is their story great, the food is as well.  I am always impressed with their polite and attentive service as well.  Traveling for work all the time, I eat out more than I eat in.  The cuisine here is absolutely delicious and will keep you coming back.  My favorites are by far the crawfish egg rolls, shrimp and grits, and their homemade mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Lucious is so welcoming.  I'm so happy to have an alternate option in the area to pickup dinner.  Food is good.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem while visiting friends. Lucious is delightful, made great suggestions even though we were probably his last customers of the night. Had crab and Brie soup, seafood gumbo, pasta salad, penne with crawfish, jambalaya, collards and white chocolate bread pudding. Everything was great. Can't wait to come this way again and try even more."}
{"text":"Cool concept. GREAT fresh food options packaged to go. The gumbo, jambalaya and collards were amazing. All items are packaged so that they can be warmed up at home/office. No flavor lost....everything is yummy. We will be back.
Parking is easy; \"In and out\" type of location."}
{"text":"After reading all of the positive reviews,decided to stop by on lunch to pick up food. The owner Lucious was friendly, professional and even let me try some samples. Today I went with the shrimp n grits and the bread pudding and they are delicious! Definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"Great spot...If you like a piece of nawlins...try spango tea excellent"}
{"text":"I came to this casual cajun joint with low expectations because hubby had tried the shrimp & grits and didn't like it much. But that's not a traditional cajun dish, so I was happy to try it. It has seating both indoors and outdoors and despite the counter ordering, I was impressed by the attentive service to the table.  Their challenge is that there's no street visibility, only Light Rail visibility, but you could park in Circle Apartments parking lot off Bland or South & Rensselaer.

We tried the crawfish étouffée and jambalaya, and both really loved our respective dishes.  Each came with a cheddar biscuit that was surprisingly delicious and crave worthy. They also offer NOLA favorites gumbos, red beans and rice and Po boys, which we look forward to trying. I just hope they hang in there and get some signage on South so they make it."}
{"text":"I first tried their food at a catered party and was really impressed. So, when a friend suggested we eat there, I jumped at the chance.  They are located in the Randolph Medical Center at 1928 Randolph Road. 

Basically, they operate from a little store-front, rather than a full service sit-down restaurant. But, don't let that dissuade you from going.  You go place your order at the cash register, and they will bring it out of the kitchen for you. There are tables and chairs in the lobby of the building as well as a few spots outdoors where you can sit down and enjoy a delectable meal. (Or, if you live or work close by, take out is a great option). 

They typically offer specials which vary each day.   I am a big fan of  their Etoufee, Creole, and the pasta dishes that I've tried here. They also have a really good southern (i.e., really sweet) sweet tea, and don't forget to pick up a delicious dessert to take home for later!  Their White Chocolate Bread Pudding  is amazing! And you can't go wrong with any of their cakes  (which, depending on the flavor of the day, could be lemon, strawberry, banana,coconut, german chocolate, carrot, red velvet, pineapple, or chocolate carmel).

If you love the richness of cajun food, check them out - you'll be so glad you did!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for 4 entrees and 2 appetizers for only $26.00.  I think due to the Groupon, the fact that it was a Saturday evening and the restaurant is fairly small, there was about a 30 minute wait. 
Okay so I will start with the reason they got ONLY 4 stars, and not 5 like I wanted to give was due to SERVICE!  Don't get me wrong, everyone was super nice and TRIED to be well attentive, but that I think is the issue.  No one is given their OWN tables to wait or be held accountable to, so you are repeating the same thing to 2 or 3 different waiters that are \"checking\" on you and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  If I wasn't an honest person, I would have had 2 extra (free) appetizers and an extra (free) side of yams because the one waitress didn't know we already received our order of appetizers, ate it and had our table cleared.  HOWEVER, although the service could be better, the FOOD WAS AMAZING.  EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious!  Even down to my after dinner coffee was excellent!  I had baked chicken, mac n cheese, greens and cornbread.  I will be back for the food!"}
{"text":"They have just reopened on Bland St. A little tricky to park, but there is a train stop right at the front door. This is a must no matter how you get there.
Truly the best Cajun food I have ever had. You will do a happy dance after you have tried they're food. I promis."}
{"text":"First, the food was good. We tried chicken wings, seafood gumbo and jambalaya. a little expensive for such small portion of food. The reason im giving one star is the service was horrible! No greeting when walk in, the girl in register told us to sit yourself. then she just walked to us ask what we want without menu. we asked for menu, later we have another server came get our order. food arrived our table with no cutlery. We asked the girl server for cutlery. she went to the back of kitchen took her 10 mins to come back to front, and she pick up some cutlery beside the tea machine in the front floor. then we saw the other server just clock in and order food, go clean some tables and sit down and eat! another one i guess he placed wrong order was arguing with the chef. when we check out we dont have a ticket. we walk to the front, another girl looks like she is a manager (she is not in purple tee uniform) she asked us what did we order, she didnt see the ticket.......
the worst service ever! even Mcdonald's says Thank you"}
{"text":"Yes, they're back but not with a restaurant but 'gourmet to go' prepared meals.  Let me assure you that the food is still amazing as ever at their new grab and go location.  

If you're not familiar with them, they offer Authentic New Orleans cuisine and have previously had 2 restaurants in Charlotte and was most recently offering their prepared meals at Atherton Mills.  This location is within a neighborhood off of Prosperity and Eastfield with other businesses, apartments and homes.  

They have packaged all of their signature specialties to be picked up for lunch, dinner, etc.  I've always been a fan of the gumbo, red beans and rice and the famous strango drink, but I've recently become a fan of their shrimp and grits, collards, bread pudding, baked fish with shrimp and crab sauce and the German chocolate cake.  I've had to force myself not go over there daily for the shrimp and grits, it's just so good and you can really eat the grits with nothing on them, they are just that good in my opinion.  If you're in the area, check them out and try not to 'od' on the German chocolate cake as I did...."}
{"text":"Went to the opening of the Bland St location and I was hoping I would be able to give a good review. No can do.
I'll let the slow service go since it was the first day, but was disappointed overall. 
I ordered the French Quarter pasta and have two problems with it. It was extremely overpriced for the small lunch portion at $11.91 and the lobster bisque that it was supposed to made in was just orange grease. There was clearly a breakdown of the cream that was used and it looked very bad. The flavor however was good. 
This is a \"no go\" for me."}
{"text":"I tried the jerk chicken and chicken gumbo. The chicken had flavor down to the bone! The gumbo was good too. The owners were so nice and helpful. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I didn't see my review posted on the 11th and since I was there the same night Spencer went with his family....I wanted this place to have a fair and balanced review that included the good and the bad.  

I had to get my two cents in in case some people choose to complain after this Saturday night...justifyable...but.....yes, they were a little overwhelmed because they posted a Groupon voucher for which, half of Charlotte responded to and chose Saturday night to use.  There was a bit of a wait....but, as a New Yorker, good food, and a good restaurant are worth the wait....so when WE see long lines, that means the place is living up to its reputation.  Things they need to correct........some of the wait staff need to be trained better.  Tell the dish washer the he is not to leave until the restaurant closes and all the dishes are washed...so you don't run out of clean utensils while diners are still eating.  High fives and congratulations to Paulette, who, I am not sure, is the head server or owner, not sure.  Under very challenging circumstances, this Saturday night, she remained professional, pleasant and as accommodating as any good restaurant owner could be.  The fact that she went to extraordinary Lengths to not only personally introduce herself  to us on our way out, but to explain in detail what went wrong and why.... and how she could make it up to us, made us totally forgive the fact that my boyfriend never got to eat his meal while I, on the other hand, had the single most delicious smothered pork chop, fabulous potato salad, and tasty black eyed peas.  Because of Paulette, my boyfriend, who is very critical of less than stellar customer service and food, indicated that despite these hiccups, he/we would love to go back to this restaurant...especially for the pork chop.  Hopefully, they will have given their waitstaff a bit more tips on waiting tables.  PS.....we know your location is challenging.  Move your sign up to where the Light Rail is..since that is along where you are.  It makes more sense than where it is now....which forces people to look directly into building 222 and wonder how a restaurant can be where people live.  Its misleading. If I am standing at the Light Rail and Bland, your sign (if positioned there) will point me in the right direction.   Much success to this restaurant.  They deserve it.  Can't wait to go back again.  Thanks Paulette for being so gracious!"}
{"text":"They let us sample a bunch of stuff and YUM it was all good. Very cool concept. I would even consider heating up the food there and eating at one of the tables- you don't have to tip and wait to be served. Just go right in pick out what you want and eat it."}
{"text":"The good is sooo good here...everything is authentic New Orleans food! So far my fac is the crawfish gumbo, which is the best I've ever had, and I've ordered it all over the lowcountry of the Carolinas and the gulf! The boidain balls are a great compliment to the gumbo too! 

I'm not a mac n cheese guy, but when my daughter proclaimed it to be the best she's ever had, I paid attention and tried some...it was very very good. 

So far, everything Lucious makes is a 4 or 5 star dish!!

We try to go once a week to avoid cooking, and rarely have leftovers!"}
{"text":"We finally tried it for lunch. The food was ok, not particularly cheap for such a casual venue.  A bit anti-climatic after all this wait. I decided to give them a little time before we tried a second time."}
{"text":"Lucious is simply amazing. Being from New Orleans it's always hard to find true New Orleans cuisine. We tried the gumbo, jambalaya, and bread budding. It's was like being transported back home to my apartment on Napoleon and St Charles. The smells, taste, and presentation was so welcoming...my comfort food. The bread budding brought back memories of my dad's bread budding, not overly sweet and so decadent. I am so excited to have found a slice of home in a foreign place. This will be my weekend go to!!!!!! Thanks for the experience!!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday (10/27/12) with a friend from New Orleans so you know she knows what she's talking about!!!! We both tried the Mardi Gras Jambalaya and it was amazing!!! It comes with a cheddar biscuit and that was on point. You get a pretty decent size portion for $8. I know they opened a couple of months ago at the new location but they had their \"Grand Opening Celebration\" yesterday. We got a free glass of wine (which was good) and beignets (which could have been a tad bit sweeter). 

The only complaint that I have is the size of the restaurant, which is on the small side. Other than that, I would definitely go back to try other things. And it's right on the light rail line, which is sweet!!!"}
{"text":"I'm basing my review on authenticity.  Gumbo was delicious with that last kick of spice that sends you to the bayou.  Jambalaya average but good.
The cons: location, location, location. It was worth the drive but thank goodness for GPS"}
{"text":"Great food, great concept and wonderful owners. We love the field peas and the macaroni salad!!!  If I could give them 10 stars I would!!!  The shop is super cute and very clean!  We are using them to cater our Christmas Party this year. I can wait to try all of the new items coming!"}
{"text":"Within 5 minutes of walking in I felt very welcome in a friendly unique atmosphere.  The owner, Lucius went out of his way to make my experience worth while.  Before I had left, I had fallen in love with their signature drink \"Strango\" and the food was delicious!  Without a doubt you will have a good time when you come in tor a bite to eat at a good price."}
{"text":"Finally, a Cajun restaurant with good Cajun food in Charlotte. I had the Shrimp Po' Boy with a cup of Seafood Gumbo. The gumbo tasted great, although they served it a bit cooler than I like. I prefer hot and they served it warm. The po' boy tasted fresh. I ordered mine with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The shrimp were fried, but not too much, just enough to taste. The hoagie bun was a bit thick, though.

I couldn't pass up an opportunity to try the beignets. They make each order of beignets by hand and they did not disappoint. Fluffy, warm, and delicious.

Overall, the food tasted great and the service was quick and inviting. The price is a bit on the high side for what you get, but I'm not complaining. I'd rather pay a tiny bit more for good Cajun food than suffer through mediocrity."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out today with my sis and had to write a review!  Lucius greeted us upon arrival explaining the concept and offering us free samples and wow what a pleasant man he was.  After some sampling I must say the Shrimp Étouffée, the Jambalaya, and my personal favorite the red beans with sausage were just to die for.  High ratings for the \"Strango Juice\" as well.  Also as someone who loves New Orleans and the food out there, I think this would be anyones go to in the Charlotte area to check out.  Also the hospitality you get as soon as your arrive doesn't hurt either! Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Katrina was undoubtably an awful event that lead to a lot of tragic and devastating loss. However, it did lead the owners of this amazing place to Charlotte, NC for a new start. I'm so glad they stayed here. Nice people for sure and their food is what Charlotte has needed but never had - genuine Louisiana cooking. That is to say, not something called Cajun just because somebody baked some beans then poured a thick coating of spices over a piece of meat and put it all on a menu and expected you to pay $25 for the experience. Nope, these folks know what they are doing and do it so very very well. Trust me. 

Now here's the weird part. If you thought finding say a place like the \"Wreck\" in Charleston was a fun challenge, you haven't seen nothing. No one could know where Bite Your Tongue is unless they worked around the Presby medical campus or that area of town. They are located inside the lobby of an office building (the Randolph Medical Center office buidling) in a space no bigger than what  you'd expect to find at a sandwhich shop. That's because the place WAS a stand up to order sandwhich shop before they arrived. So you still walk up to a counter, place your order get your food and leave. It's too small for tables and again, it's inside an office buidling lobby. I hope they get their own place soon. Most folks don't know about this gem but it's worth seeking out.  They were a recent national finalist for a Hoddie Award too (best soul food category) - that's pretty impressive considering where they are based out of. 

Great deserts too!!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place yesterday and was so excited to try it tonight for dinner. I LOVE N.O. food and their menu looked amazing. I was very disappointed when I got there at 5 pm (2 hours before they are supposed to close) only to find the place locked up and completely empty with no signs or explanation. Tried calling the number on their website and it wouldn't go through. I have already requested a refund from Groupon but they shouldn't even be selling them if the place is closed."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of things about this place we finally gave it a try. Rushed here at 6:45 since they close at 7. The sign said open but there seemed to be no one inside so I was a little confused, but then a young man inside heard me fiddling with the door and came out to open. He was a really sweet kid. He showed us the whole place and explained to us what was what. He knew the menu well too. We decided to get the jambalaya, spinach artichoke dip, mac n cheese, stuffed mushrooms and the BBQ wings. The wings were okay. The stuffed mushrooms and mac n cheese was really good. The jambalaya could have been a little bit spicier but wasn't bad and the spinach artichoke dip was okay too. Luckily we had pita chips at home. I was wondering, don't places usually give you some kind of chips to go with dips? Oh well, it wasn't that important. 
They did have quite a few desserts too, but we didn't try any. They also serve coffee and have sodas and drinks. Next time we will try the gumbo and maybe a few other new things."}
{"text":"I visited New Orleans a little while ago and got a craving for beignets so after googling beignets in Charlotte I came upon this place. I convinced a few co-workers to join me and although I was immediately dissappointed that they were out of beignets I ordered the jambalaya with salad anyway and after eating that I almost forgot I wanted beignets. Plus after getting back in the office my co-workers and I exchanged emails for an hour about how we were definitely going back next week. Plus the owners were really nice. I can't wait until they move closer to me in Southend."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge fan of Cajun food, but I decided to try out my Groupon, and this place was pretty nice. The meal was affordable (even without the Groupon), the food was nicely seasoned (got the blackened fish with greens), and the Cafe au Lait was delicious. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"As a native from New Orleans, this is one of my very favorite places to eat. Best BBQ shrimp I have had (don't forget to dip the bread in the sauce) and we catered oyster dressing for Thanksgiving. I tried it and it was the best I have ever had in my LIFE!! A MUST order for Christmas. Also, game hen and stuffed peppers were amazing. My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Very friendly staff and owner is always around and so nice. I would return 1,000%. LOVE THEIR FOOD!!! Make sure to order something authentic to New Orleans. You will be happy (red beans, jambalya, etc)"}
{"text":"My friend & I went last night and because of a mass Groupon special they were swamped! We waited 2 hrs to sit and get our food and it was worth it. There were several complainers (we're not) of course but hey they never left lol! The manager was so sweet and accommodating and was doing everything from facing complainers and waitressing. The place is a bit small bit still nice. We had the BBQ chicken wings which were not BBQ at all but so delish I'm going to get more today! The crawfish egg rolls we didn't like. I couldn't taste any crawfish only cabbage. My friend had fried fish and mashed potatoes which were both delish. I had the seafood gumbo which was very spicey but so good. The cornbread taste like cake just like I like it. The Mac n cheese was just a little bland but cheesy and the beignets were magnificent."}
{"text":"Went to lunch to try their hotdog with chili, crab fries, and a soda special and I wasn't totally impressed. While the food was tasty, it was too simple and small portioned. (Blame myself for expecting more for only $5)

I had my eye on the Shrimp and Grits. Looks like I will have to go take another trip (isn't hard since I live next door)"}
