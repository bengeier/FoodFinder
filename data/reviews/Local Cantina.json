{"text":"Awesome place. Finally a good Mexican restaurant in Chesterland.  Excellent service, excellent food, fair prices and a fun atmosphere. I won't go back to Rancho los Alazanes anymore."}
{"text":"I got the roasted carnitas taco and a chorizo and egg one. The food was basically inedible. The pork tasted like it was made a few days ago. The taco shells tasted bad as well. Only gave it a two star because Chris, the server, was great. Didn't have any alcohol but I would probably only go for that and some chips in the future."}
{"text":"Service was good. People were friendly and helpful 
Food was poor quality and simply not good
Try someplace else."}
{"text":"Awesome, super friendly staff that's full of energy, attentive and eager to know you, by name. 
Had three different soft shell tacos which were all great, along with the complimentary, self served chips and salsa, which is also very good.
Mainly the usual suspects on tap, I.e. Bud, miller, etc.. But a couple nice craft beers. I was promised there will be more in the future... they just didn't want to offend the regulars who prefer stuff next to water.
This being the very first day, I can't wait to watch everything develop into a great Chesterland attraction!"}
{"text":"After several visits, my opinion is they have excellent tacos and guac.  They have a great selection and tacos are stuffed and not skimpy on filling.  Only complaint is tempura shrimp tacos have plenty of shrimp but sometimes lack the other filling.  Service  is always pleasant and efficient.  Also wish they were open for lunch during week."}
{"text":"A neighbor mentioned to me that Danny Boy's had converted its bar area into a Mexican restaurant and that the food was good.  We finally went. We loved the serve-yourself chips and salsa bar. Both were very good. I wish they had at least one more salsa offering, though.  Decor is cool and it works.  Fun atmosphere.  I went with the Crunchweezy taco and it was yummy.  Hubs did the steak fajitas and said they were good. I was impressed that they served authentic flour tortillas. Sit in the back near the garage door that opens to the patio during warmer weather. So great to have this great Mex option close to us!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for trivia Thursday night and had so much fun! Food was good and bartenders were fun, nice, and attentive. I made a mistake when I ordered (didn't realize the fish tacos I ordered came with fried fish) and management quickly fixed the problem and took the price of my non-fried protein replacement off the tab even though it was my mistake. Decent beer list and awesome mixed drinks. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good but small Margaritas. Food was BLAND , server said the kitchen is usually very good but must of had an off night. Told us if it happened again, our meal would be comped....silly girl thought we would  be back."}
{"text":"A year ago they had the best tacos & Mexican food outside of downtown CLE!! And some amazing drinks to go with plus they have bomb ass chips n salsa too!

Now its all average at best! The taco shells are stale  and you can tell thing have really gone downhill!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Mexican I have ever had. Waiter suggested 2 Taco's for lunch because they were good size. I was shocked at what came to the table. Two 4 in. tacos one chicken, one steak fajita. The steak seriously had two small strips of meat with probably a tablespoon of onions and peppers for a grand price of $$$$4.00. Chicken no better for $3.50. Oh, and the shell was so awful tasting that I ate just the filling. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"VERY Customer-Focused Restaurant! 

So our 1st time here, the place was kind of empty since it was 3 PM on a Sunday, but the bartender / waitress was SUPER nice, and talked to us about the basics, told us to help ourselves to the Unlimited Nachos and Salsa (good by the way) and for whatever reason, hooked us up with a free Queso.  (Sorry to her Manager if that wasn't allowed, but it elevated this experience to a 5* off the bat.)  

Later she spilled a small amount of my almost empty drink, and gave me another free beer.  She also treated our family great, didn't mind waiting on our late guests, and had great recommendations regarding the food options.  

Cool Decor, great food, affordable prices.  I would come on Tuesday for their Happy Hour / $2 Tacos, but A's all around either way."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm actually obsessed with this place.  I feel like there aren't a ton of craft taco places in the area, so Local Cantina is much needed!  I actually had been to a Local Cantina near Columbus, so I was super pleasantly surprised when I spotted the sign driving through Chesterland.  Now other Yelpers have mentioned this, but the entrance to this restaurant is pretty confusing.  My advice is go in the door for Danny Boy's, you will feel like you're at the wrong restaurant, but once you're inside veer to the left and you will be in Local.  Once you make it inside the difficult part is over.  When I went, we seated ourselves and were soon greeted by a server.  The chips and salsa are self serve, but the servers will go through this with you if it's your first time there.  Now local is pretty affordable but here are my money saving tips for this restaurant...
-Check in on Yelp and get a buy one get one free taco
-Come on Taco Tuesday - $2 tacos all day when you eat there
-Come during Happy Hour - Mon.-Fri. 3-6pm $5 mustache ride margaritas and $3 drafts

I happened to come on a Tuesday during Happy Hour, so I got a great deal on everything.  My go to order is the Baja shrimp, carne asada, and bbq beef brisket tacos. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the taco options though.  Also the mustache ride margs are sooo yummy and pretty darn strong!  When the waitress brought mine out I was a little disappointed and thought it was on the small side, but after I finished the first one and then the second one I realized they were small but mighty!  I highly recommend Local for great tacos and a great night out with friends or family! I'm"}
{"text":"I kid You not, this is not what I was expecting when we went the first time. It's attached to Danny boys which is a weird entrance but once you walk into the restaurant, the atmosphere is so fun and the friendly staff greets you!

We have now been there three times and can't get enough. The bar area is so fun and the bartenders are great. The drinks are delicious with a variety of margaritas and on tap beer selections. 

But now let's talk about the food. We've had the burritos, the street corn that's to die for, that taco salads, the tacos, and the guac. It's all so good! We weren't expecting that at all. But even better yet, they have serve yourself chips and salsa bar. Yes, a restaurant after my own heart. 

The only bummer is it's not super popular yet so it's not very lively but we've seen it pick up since it opened which we love! You forget your in chesterland. It's a great restaurant that has the Treemont/Lakewood feel. We can't get enough and will be back (especially for taco Tuesday's!)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once right when they first opened, but I remember the food and drinks being great! They really fixed the place up! It could definitely be a fun bar to hang out at!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  had the grilled chicken taco and Carne asada taco , very little meat and the taco shells were tiny. Chips and salsa, chips very blah, salsa too sweet. Server was very apologetic but will never be back."}
{"text":"Well we started out on our adventure to go to lure bistro in Willoughby for tacos. When we arrived at lure the bar was packed and they do not offer the happy hour food prices to patrons who sit at a table. What a bummer! They need to kaizen this area of customer service at lure! 
Anyways we then decided to come out to Chesterland to find the taco place I have heard about that is off the beaten path. We figured out while driving there was no road sign my girlfriend spotted it right next to a Danny Boys sign in the plaza. So I slammed on the brakes and we hooked a right into the plaza. The restaurant shares a space with Danny Boys. We sat down and had a great meal. The staff was friendly and the tacos were great. You should check this place out on Tuesdays for great deals on tacos. They have about 12-15 different tacos to choose from. Five stars from Bigfoot here!"}
{"text":"Jumping atmosphere.  Great service.  Super food.  Watch out for the cute bartenders.   They'll get you to drink and tip well.  Super service."}
{"text":"It is a little confusing when you first walk into Cantina (I literally argued with my friend about the door. She insisted It was Danny Boys and didn't want to go in) but you'll get past it. Seriously- get past the ornate iron gate and you're in a very cool little spot that you'll want to come back to. We started with filling our own chips and salsa and, um, devouring those. We also got the guacamole which I thought was a perfect portion size and price. It was very fresh and creamy. I got a classic margarita. It was good, but actually quite strong and I couldn't finish it. That says nothing about the quality of the margarita, but everything about my wussiness. 

My bestie and I each ordered 3 tacos. That may have been a little ambitious, but I would still suggest that number to get a good taste of the menu. My favorite by far was the Cantina fish. It was typically dressed with jalapeno slaw and a sour cream that added a nice rich flavor to the hot, fried flaky fish. Yum. I also enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken and the Crunchweezy, which had a lot going on.

Best part for sure was our server. She was so fun and friendly and easy-going. Jess and I both agreed we wanted her to be our new best friend. She did try to trick us into dessert- some sort of fried cookie sorcery. She told us there was a rumor and we were obviously all ears. Can't fault the girl, though. We still love her.

Thanks to Yelp I got a free taco, but even without that, my 3 tacos, margarita and guacamole came to just over $20. It was a great value and I left feeling satisfied. Okay, stuffed.
It's worth the drive for this west-sider!"}
