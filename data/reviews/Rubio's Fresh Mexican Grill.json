{"text":"If you like fish tacos try Rubios!  The food is fresh and always delicious.  I love the classic fish taco, grilled salmon and grilled mahi mahi taco, and the mesquite shrimp burrito.  The salsa is also fresh and compliments all the food well.  The staff makes the food fast and they're always friendly.  I also like the fact that you can call ahead and place an order."}
{"text":"I love Rubios. I can't really help it. The fish tacos with some lime and a Corona just hits the spot sometimes. I'd recommend it over any of the other restaurants on this particular strip in Surprise.

Edit: Now closed."}
{"text":"It often smells like portapotties outside but if you can withstand it the tacos inside are decent. You can call your order in ahead which is quite convenient since it seems everyone in line ahead of you takes forever to decide on their order. The salsas are good but there all out in the open :/"}
{"text":"LOVE Rubios. Food here is always great and salsa is fresh!"}
{"text":"Very well managed.  On the better end of the chain.  9 times out of 10 GREAT, efficient, friendly, service.

Can't beat fish taco Tuesday's $1.25 per taco.  

Excellent fresh salsa options.  I rotate between the hot salsa and chipotle, add some fresh onions and chives.  Food always well prepared.  Great for take out they always hook it up fast and fresh.

Dining in they have bottles of beer on ice.  Decent indoor/outdoor seating.  Kept clean enough."}
{"text":"I usually frequent this Rubios for lunch.  The food quality and service is the same as other Rubios.  The staff is friendly, the food is quick and fresh and they get a pretty good lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Probably the last review for this location as it closes today.  Thanks for many very good lunches over the past six years.  Love the salsa bar, chips, and burrito especial.  Will have to drive a few minutes to hit the 59th and 101 location-worth the drive :)"}
{"text":"I used to come to this store for lunch when they first opened years ago. 
I haven't been in awhile and wanted fish tacos on Saturday. I picked a couple up to take out. 
This place \"used\" to be good. 

I do not know exactly \"what\" it was..the fish or the tortilla, but it was just a mouthful of mush. 
The fish was a little tiny sliver of breading with fish in it (supposedly). 
I spit it out and tossed it in the trash. 
Tried the second taco...same thing. 
Had I been at the store, I would have demanded my money back. 
I do not know they are this disgusting on just the weekends or if they consistantly serve this substandard crap throughout the week.

I will never know because they lost my business!"}
{"text":"We used this Rubio's location for a fundraiser we had this year for our school. FANTASTIC staff, friendly service, and the food is great. Very generous portions and fresh, hot and yummy. You will never eat at Taco Bell, Del Taco or any of the Filiberto's spin offs ever again. 

The restaurant is always clean and you can count on a good experience every time. :)"}
{"text":"Sure miss our Rubios in Surprise but this is a nice treat near the movie theater on Deer Valley! Food is solid, staff was friendly, salsa was yum as always. Can always count on Rubios for consistent food."}
{"text":"I am surprised too that I am giving a 5 star rating. However, this place deserves it. This location in particular just wow-ed me. Both employees that I met where extremely nice and had outstanding customer service skills. It shocked me and I was pleasantly surprised. They kept addressing me by first name after I told them my name, nice touch. They made my order exactly the way I wanted it and verified my specifications to be sure I got what I wanted. The food was good, fresh, and I got exactly what I paid for. I had a salad with grilled chicken, pico de gallo, cheese, guacomole, romaine lettuce, and pinto beans. YUM!!! Plus more low-cal than most other fast foodie type choices. Overall great experience, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Rubios is right on the corner near the theater. They have been there since the complex opened and have always done well. Then place is lean and the staff efficient. 

The food is average but good. 

Today I had 2 Fish tacos beans and chips. 
The tacos were OK the fish was just a little on the soft mushy side but not bad enough to no eat. The flavors are all great with the cabbage and the Baja sauce. 
The beans are refried with a heavy pepper taste (my kid won't eat em) with a little sprinkle of cojita cheese. I like the beans. 
Chips are thicker and small but are a nice add on to the meal. 

The price was good something like $5.75 or something with only water to drink."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but for fast food I can't handle the SLOW service. The two ladies that routinely take the orders and call them out when ready have to be the slowest fast food workers I think I have ever seen.

Neither are friendly. They both seem to be hating their job. 

Ordered: Nachos with grilled chicken. Decent. But when I have a half hour for lunch I don't want to spend the majority of it in line so Mary Worth can make her extra spending money behind the counter."}
{"text":"Smooth experience, above par food selection, and fast. Not my first time here, and wont be the last.

After looking at the receipt I was slightly over charged from the special's menu, but not enough to say anything. 

Salsa bar, hot chips, and fruit punch made up for it.

Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Came here for free tacos after my last experience with another Rubios store. The cashier was friendly, confirmed everything we said, and pretty much got the entire order wrong. We did complicate things a bit, but I didn't get guac on my Especial tacos, and my hubby didn't get the mango habanero salsa. Otherwise, it was fine.

Unrelated to rubios, we were sitting outside and the mall security guard just came up to our table, maybe a foot or less from me, and started staring through the window looking at the menu. It was a little unnerving, just him standing there with his stuff in my face while I'm eating. Little weird.

Manager came out and cleared our plates, which was nice, and they were out of tea, which I have come to expect from every fast food place ever. Bleh experience."}
{"text":"I got my regular - Big Burrito Especial - Chicken.  Yummy.  I swear they use different tortillas here, it was really good.  I like staring at the fish in the tank."}
{"text":"Great place to grab something good when you're on the go!! Love the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"THis is my favorite location. They actually make something that I crave but is not on the menu. If they ever stopped making it I would probably stop going there, but so far so good. My entire family fights over the verde salsa. It is the best."}
{"text":"I will give them credit for being fast.  The food is ok, but doesn't really stand out in any way."}
{"text":"Coastal Trio was pretty good. Give it a try. Yum. $9.19 with tax.  Otherwise, prices are quite high for tacos and such. Must have a coupon to make it a good value."}
