{"text":"Nice clean place great food macaroni salad was great . Went in to eat it was quit smelled good fast service did not take long to get my food. Food was hot served fresh."}
{"text":"I went in, because I try to support my neighborhood businesses. Let me start out with the best. The garlic shrimp was awesome, I was not, however, impressed by any of the other dishes. We had the pork roast andbit was dry. Okay flavor, but the sauce/gravy was greasy, lumpy and cold. Overall, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. It was a lot of cash that mostly was thrown away because my family didn't like any of it."}
{"text":"Big portions = 5 stars! Got the usual spicy chicken.Lau lau and kalua pig. Plenty pork = delicious."}
{"text":"This spot popped up recently on my side of town. I love Hawaiian food so I of course I had to give it a go.  On my first visit it was completely empty. Be prepared it's a dive, but dives are the best. It's run by the owners who definitely work hard. Their food is fresh and made with love. So far I've tried their Hawaiian bbq chicken which came with lots of rice and lots of chicken to my surprise Also, a combo plate of the chicken and beef. Both very full of flavor and not dry at all. Loco Moco is well priced for the abundance of food you receive. The taste is excellent as far as the main entree is concerned. The Mac salad not my favorite. Other then that I love that they have a protein driven menu with tasty sauces. My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time going here and I am in love with their spam fried rice I also ordered the spicy chicken which was so good I highly recommend this place. The people that work there have such a good energy I hope this place does well excited for another Hawaiian place on the east side"}
