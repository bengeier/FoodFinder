{"text":"Gujrathi food is one its kind and you can simply make out by the way it tastes. There was not a single restaurant in Calgary serving gujrathi food up until now....  Not now. Rajbhog is one great place to enjoy a decent tasteful gujrathi Thali. Loved the food, loved the place and the service. If you are looking for soulful simple Indian comfort food it's the place to go.. great value for money and extremely courteous service."}
{"text":"Rajbhog is part of a restaurant trend - \"trendy, casual, street-food\" based restaurants\" that has started in NE Calgary witihn Indian community.  While I have not been familiar with \"Gujarati\" food, they serve many of the popular street food snacks.  The food is good."}
{"text":"One of the best place for fast food. I tired vada paav and dabeli, really good taste and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to Rajbhog yesterday during lunch hours and the food was Yummy! We ordered Pav Bhaji, Mysore masala dosa, bombay sandwich and Thepla. Everything was fresh and tasted good. Would definitely recommend Rajbhog if you're looking for a good Indian / Gujarati food in Calgary."}
{"text":"Rajbhog offers what I call the 'Authentic Mumbai style Gujraati' food. It's a little far off for downtown birds but if you're missing the Mumbai street food or drooling just thinking about good o'l fashioned gujju dishes, make a trip!  As it happens with me all the time, upon our first visit we didn't even bother thinking about main course. Had to stuff ourselves with delicious Vada Paav, Daabeli, Cheese Vegetable Bombay Grill Sandwich, Sev Khamani and Paani Puri.   Everything tasted fresh and crispy. Service was polite and friendly. Having a gujraati friend helped a lot getting some special requests through. Won't mind returning if I find myself in the neighbourhood."}
