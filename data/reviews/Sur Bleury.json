{"text":"I had the Magret de Canard Fumé. It wasn't what I expected.   The duck seemed to have been pressed, smoked and dried (almost like jerkey). The atmosphere was very nice for working class civilians. Food selection was limited and many things on the menu were sold out during prime hours of lunch, however service was very good. Food was average."}
{"text":"Brief resume: Really expensive and disappointed for what we got!  We came in at 12h00, two on three dishes on the blackboard were already sold out! Only the fried calamari dish was left. It was already a bad start.  Then my friend ordered the crab cake dishes. It was a plate full of salad with a small crab cake. For 17,25$, we would have expected more. Mac and Cheese was good (macaroni with pesto and a bit of chicken), but nothing impressive. At the end, we are not gonna go back for sure!"}
