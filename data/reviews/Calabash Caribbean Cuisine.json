{"text":"I've had the roti and the fish bake from here a few times. Food was really good both times."}
{"text":"Nice little joint in South Mississauga. We had the doubles, jerk chicken w/ rice and goat curry roti. The doubles here are amazing. The puris werent overly oil and were soft which I enjoyed. They did not shy away with the meta in the roti which was real good. Nice and tender. The jerk chicken was swrved with pigeon rice. Loved the rice. The owners are very friendly. We look forward to going back again. Ps they are also certified halal."}
{"text":"Our family LOVE this place and it is our frequent go-to for takeout or sit-down dining on a reasonable budget. This is a small family run business. The menu is a modest but adequate size. We particularly enjoy their curries on rice and the oxtail is to die for. The rotis are okay but they use too much flatbread wrap and cornmeal for our taste. Portions are ample. The family that run this place are incredibly lovely and they particularly enjoy children."}
{"text":"We love love love their rotis and almost have it once a week.  The portions are so big that it's enough for dinner and lunch the next day.  I'm not a huge fan of chick peas so I always order the parathas instead ($1 extra vs. roti).  Be careful with the spice level when choosing mild/medium/hot.  I can take a lot of heat but sometimes even hot is too hot for me as it's not always consistent.  Do yourself a favour and call to order ahead of time to save some time.  Always friendly and service with a smile."}
{"text":"I will give them 1 star for flavour...ordered oxtail, jerk chicken, and rice and peas for a small family function of about 10 people. Oxtail portion for what they think is 10 people is absolutely pathetic. More like 5 people. The tray of oxtail had only 1 layer of meat, enough to cover the bottom.  Jerk chicken, they gave 10 legs...still not enough. Rice of course was ok coz its only rice!  I will never order from here again. I will also encourage people to NOT order from here as well. I specifically told them 10 people and they probably only gave enough food for 5-6."}
{"text":"The 1 star is specifically for the chicken roti;  the actual experience was great. I'm sorry to say that the roti was essentially inedible. I've had to toss almost all of it. By an order of magnitude, the worst roti I have ever had. All respect to the people who love this place... just way below par for me. I was craving the amazing taste I get consistently over at Island Foods (King and Dufferin) and, well... this is a very disappointing alternative. My mistake for not just doing the drive! I was the only customer there as they opened today and I'm pretty sure I heard the microwave going just before my order hit the counter. Dunno what to make of that... yesterday's filling? Service was great and friendly, Portion size is immense. Even the washroom was spotless. Unfortunately for Calabash, the food is why one returns. I won't return."}
{"text":"Another great Yelp find. I was at a nearby clinic and was delayed thru lunch, so I called ahead to order for takeout for my wife and I. Two chicken roti were ordered and made fresh for the time I asked for. Met the owner who was really friendly and mentioned he might be opening another location! I hope its in Etobicoke.  Huge portion and very filling. Will visit again. Probably will sit it next time, it seems like a cozy spot. Thanks for the space."}
{"text":"yamon just finished the morning dra and once again had this craving for the finest roti in mississauga.call ahead so you don't gotta wait mon :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Caribbean restaurants in Mississauga. I've had several different things off their menu and I've never been disappointed. Very friendly and attentive staff. Great little spot."}
{"text":"Didn't like the food at all. Got the oxtail and it was very boney, tough and the flavour was too strong. There was way too much cinnamon and allspice and it gave you heartburn while eating it. Had a slight bitterness from the amount of spice. It had a decent heat, but had to douse it with hot sauce to make it decent enough to eat. They give you a small salad with lettuce leaves and 1 slice of tomato and a little container filled with Kraft Italian dressing. They don't really care about making authentic delicious food here. The lady at the counter was nice so I gave it an extra star, but if you want good Caribbean food, go else where"}
{"text":"I like the Roti and doubles here but I think the real deal is the \"Bake and Fish\" for only $6!  Bake is a kind of fried bread that's light and fluffy.  The fish is lightly battered with coleslaw.  It's a good portion and very satisfying for the price.  I prefer this to most of the fish tacos I've had lately and much better than a filet o fish.  It's a must try."}
{"text":"Rice was very moist and not dry. Chicken was great too! I'm happy with this spot and will go again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a casual dinner on a Friday night. We were warmly greeted by  the friendly owner who chatted us up a bit re: if we've been before, how we found out about the restaurant, etc. The jerk chicken with rice on the menu mentioned bone-in, so I asked if a boneless option wasn't available - was told it's not on the menu but he could make it happen with chicken breast.   I don't know much about Caribbean cuisine so can't speak to the authencity of the food at all or the quality of the rotis here, but can say that the jerk chicken meal was tasty, and the portion was good value for money. Both of us were given a tiny cup of hot sauce which basically tasted like pure lava - ridiculously hot! Maybe a few more visits and my threshold for the sauce will improve ;)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for roti and doubles in Mississauga. It's small and unassuming but most of the good places are. The owner is extremely friendly and attentive. I always get the Chana and potato roti which lasts me two meals as it is huge! The prices are very reasonable here as well. I wanted to update my review and give them a 5 because it has become evident that this is always going to be my number one roti place. I had the doubles this past weekend, extra tamarind on the side, oh boy! So delicious. They are so consistent and I feel like that is what you want in a restaurant. Too many places go downhill after a year or so, but Calabash has always stayed good."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant..... my favorite is the Fish & Bake , also like their Chicken roti , Doubles .  Friendly customer service , great price , good food & everything is prepared FRESH.   So if you're in a rush, I would suggest calling in & the food will be waiting for you.  Value For Money..... keep it up  !  Thank you  !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Ox tail dinner in Mississauga.   Wife had the chicken roti and she liked it.   My new go to place for West Indies food in the west end."}
{"text":"Popped in here craving some shrimp spiced with Caribbean flavor. I remember coming here back in the day to eat some awesome food, so coming back here after so many years was déjà vu.    They close here at 8pm on weekdays, so I ordered for pick up before they closed. I ordered the garlic shrimp -which is to die for- along with rice & peas and a house salad which comes with it. The shrimp itself was flavored so nicely with a creamy garlic sauce. The restaurant itself is cozy with decorations that scream Caribbean flavor. I will definitely be back here for some more grub. Hmm...maybe some curry goat will be next? Who knows!?"}
{"text":"Just ok to me.  (Feel a bit bad 'cause the owner/man behind the counter is really nice 'n friendly!)  There really isn't much competition in terms of West Indian food in the area, just a bunch of fast food chain restaurants across the street.   This ground-level of what looks like a business building seems to be the only ethnic options in the area with a Thai, Viet (& its past revolving door of tenants), Senor Burrito, & Calabash all under the same roof!  Anyway, I ordered the usual, gold mark standard:  boneless chicken roti on dhalpuri shell.  (I didn't notice an option of bone-in.)  Roti itself tasted as though it had been sitting out, not as fresh as it could be.  Chicken filling had some charred bits/taste to it, so seemed as though I was eating what was left at the bottom of the pot.  A bit too salty, as most roti places, and I wasn't a fan of the combo of spices that they used.  Nothing was stale per se, all edible, but not completely enjoyable or particularly delicious.  If I was in the area and had a craving, I'd stop by and perhaps order something different, but it's not something that I'd drive out of the way for."}
{"text":"Was heading by here recently and decided to drop in for some take out roti. We ordered boneless chicken and boneless goat, medium spice.  To my taste, there wasn't enough flavour in the goat or chicken. Also, the dhal puri seemed a bit drier than it needed to be.   Service was sufficient and timely for a take out order.  Overall, was a decent dinner, but I think we will stick to Radica's as I find their roti have a better taste."}
{"text":"Nice little Caribbean restaurant in a tiny non descript mall. You wouldn't find this place unless specifically looking for it.  The food was ok (3 out of 5 stars) but what separates this restaurants is the service. The service is very friendly and excellent. The owner made me feel most welcome. I only tried two items and took it back to my hotel to eat. I walked and it was cold out so i will give the food the benefit of doubt and would definitely try it again if i am in the area and in the mood for Caribbean food again."}
