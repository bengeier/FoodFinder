{"text":"It's an alright AYCE sushi place in Laval. Coming from New Jersey, I was expecting a better sushi.. It tasted good, but it was not amazing. I have had better sushi in different places like in San Fran, and NYC.  However, the price is reasonable to include sashimi in their menu.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Brought some well traveled friends there for a bite since had a craving for sushi that had been lingering for the past 2 months.  Nobody was disappointed.   Everything tasted fresh. A lot to select from. Staff was friendly. Very well priced.  Like many places you do have to pay for what u don't eat. And we over did it. We payed the little extra to bring it home w us and was still amazing the following day.  Needless to say no more sushi craving!!!!!  Only negative is that it is a hole in the wall kind of restaurants. But as iv learned they usually are the ones with the best food :)"}
{"text":"I took their AYCE tonight for $22.95. Kids up to 8 years old, price is $10.95 so took that for my little one. Wasn't disappointed at all with the quality! Majority of the comments I read here were positive, add two more like that from two non-Yelper family members, had to try it.   The place is a bit small, clean and set for casual eating experience. If you want a bit more upscale and better sushi, go to Osaka Sushi, on the next block, a stone throw away from here. Expect to pay more over there of course.   Overall, this place would do the trick for me if craving a good quality sushi. For $22.95/pp plus tax and tips you'd have lots of other choices for a casual grub besides sushi. It's a good value if you have a big appetite otherwise a bit overpriced. Nice place overall, recommended."}
{"text":"Went there last month for my bday and I was not disappointed. The place is nice and clean but nothing fancy at all. It is an all you can eat sushi place and its about 20-30$. The menu is pretty basic not too many choices but all pretty good. Sushi is freshly made right there behind the counter so you can see everything. They also have a few drinks and a small wine selection.  Sushi are fresh and made fast!!!! Love this place just wish it was a bit bigger because when its full you are pretty cramp"}
{"text":"One of my favourite all you can eat sushi. Like others said there's not much selection. However, the quAlity is very good compared to others. Another con I noticed is that they put mostly tempura in the rolls and avoid putting too much sashimi or fish."}
{"text":"I've been to many all you can eat sushi places and I must say this place is hands down the best in terms of price and quality.  The food is fresh and the service is quick.  Will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Very bad sushi, full of rice! Slow service we used all u can eat menu. I will never go back and will never recomend it to anyone. There r way better options available in montream"}
{"text":"Sushi & sashimi quality are ok, very big piece but I think the rice has not enough vinegar taste. Out of that, we are a family with 2 kids having all you can eat sushi, one of the waitress trying to charge my 1 year old son for kid price which I think quite ridiculous! Most of the all you can eat restos doesn't charge kids under 3."}
{"text":"I've come to Fuki Sushi bar a few times to enjoy some quality sushi. I usually go with the lunch \"all-you-can-eat\" option. Usually that combined with sushi should make you think... what type of washroom commitment am I expecting later on in the day but I'd be glad to report, the sushi is solid.  They have a variety of sushi on a set menu that I mostly have enjoyed. I'm quite enthused about the Vietnamese styled fresh crab rolls and peanut butter sauce. They rest? Not the best I've had but quite solid  Price-tag is under $14.  Service is quick and friendly. The place is usually pretty busy for lunch."}
{"text":"Un excellent restaurant pour des sushis à Laval. Le service est rapide! Cet été, je suis passée vite fait pour une commande pour emporter, j'ai été étonné de leur rapidité et de la qualité des sushis.  À savoir, depuis un moment ils sont fermés pour rénovation, donc il faut les appeler  pour connaître la date de réouverture qui n'est pas encore dévoilée."}
{"text":"3.75 stars for me.   Very solid sushi place that Jason (another friend and fellow Yelper) introduced me to. Sure I'm a sushi snob, a self proclaimed amateur wannabe Michelin food inspector who enjoys all types of Japanese food!   Here's the deal here:  For $13.95?you can have AYCE for lunch which is a solid offering! You have a set menu to order from which has a healthy selection.  First item selected was the green salad with what tasted like their sesame white sauce dressing. This was fresh healthy and crunchy! The highlight as agreed upon were the Vietnamese style fresh rolls with the sesame flavoured white sauce. The sushi rolls to me were okay. For me the sushi rolls were nothing spectacular. The rolls were just above average for me. To be amazing for me it's the texture of the rice and the freshness of the ingredients which was okay but not earth shattering (trust me Jason, when you eat amazing fresh sushi you will know it)!   Seriously though for the price it's a great deal. You get much less stellar sushi at Sushi Shop or YUZU for the same price so you have a bigger selection here on the menu and it's all you can eat! Hope this place stays here for a whole and doesn't raise prices!   Excellent value for the money in what Jason calls \"restaurant chain dominated\" Laval!"}
{"text":"Good sushi for all you can eat, fresh, tasty and well presented. The place is small not ideal for big groups, the service was good, not exceptional but professional. I found it odd that they charged us for our 1 year old daughter ( Ate two bites shrimp tempura and edamame) not a big deal but annoying."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and amazing customer service. Their sushis always feel fresh especially the salmon sashimi. Even though it is a small restaurant, the quality of the food is always good. I feel welcome in the restaurant and i don't feel uncomfortable if i want to order more food. I really like the girl that always serve my table. She is very nice and smiley. The only thing that bothers me is when i sit close to the window (during winter) it is very cold and uncomfortable to enjoy the food.   Other than that, I highly recommend this sushi restaurant :)"}
