{"text":"Cool little 50's diner such a shame they don't play 50's music.  The staff is friendly and all have been around for a long time, the chef included.  Our salmon filet was grilled to perfection.   Would highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my family and friends are regulars here. The entire staff here are so pleasant and accommodating. Stacey is a hoot.... we always look for her to serve us because she's super friendly and always makes sure you're enjoying your your meal,  plus she knows our order by heart,  lol! You can't beat the $2.49 breakfast special! 2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, your choice of potatoes ( hash browns or diced potatoes with onions) plus choice of toast.Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food and the prices are low considering what you get. Waitress were friendly and fast, the remember the names of returning patrons. Only complaint, and hence only 4 stars, it opens up into the casino. With no doors the cigarette smoke just drifts in, not good while eating."}
{"text":"Terrible! Not worth the drive across town. Cold prime rib served with moldy Butter that isn't dated. Who knows what else is out of date & why my prime rib was very well below satisfaction. I asked for extra sour cream & got moldy butter!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3 stars however, there is an amazing, snarky waitress Stacey who engages and welcomes all the customers.  She knows many customers names.  You can't beat the values of their breakfast specials and the food is good.  We wish we were closer, but we may travel the distance just to get the great customer service.  FYI, Stacey works in the morning."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the milkshake other than that our express BAD. Honestly I understand, you're in the el durado, but it doesn't mean you have to be literally the RUDEST waitress I've ever had in my life. It started when we first got there, it was pretty busy and there was a wait, which was okay until we went up to ask how long the wait was, she wouldn't tell us how long we had to wait. We put our name down and she kept getting the name wrong, annoyed that we had to SPELL IT OUT to her. Next when we sat down the waitress came over with the WORST ATTITUDE, I had ordered the hungry man breakfast and wondered if I could have half pancakes and half French toast, I know that all places do not do that but it was no excuse to basically yell \"NO\" in my face. She then basically TOLD ME that I was going to order pancakes, when we asked the flavors of their shakes she was SO ANNOYED to list all of them. They had literally opened AN HOUR before and this lady was already at her wits end. The rest of our meal was okay. We did order a milk but instead got coffee??? Honestly should have just paid the extra few bucks for ihop."}
{"text":"This was our first visit To Mary's Diner for dinner on a Monday.  Being a local resident and looking for \"bargain\" meals we thought this was a thumbs up.  No required points on your player's card or being a \"senior\" balances out the 'two for one' deals in other larger casinos.  A decent prime rib special for $8.99 (includes soup or salad, vegetable, and choice of potato).  The prime rib was tender.  There were numerous other \"specials\" and entrees hovering around the $8-$10 range which will probably make us repeat diners!  The staff in both the diner and casino floor were very pleasant."}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. We eat here two to three times a month. Service is usually good, Nothing too fancy, but a surprisingly diverse menu."}
{"text":"No wait seating and was ironically served by Mary...   great service and food was very good especially for the price!  Affordable and a good selection and I'm a sucker for anyplace that serves a breakfast 24/7 with eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast for $2.49!  Very awesome place with a fun decor!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Visted Mary's Diner today for lunch. Havent visited them since they switched to 50's diner theme. Food went downhill after transition.
Major improvements since our last vist.
Service was excelkent and food outstanding. New menu refkects interest in improving things. 
Had the waffle ham and cheese sandwich. Wow ! Excelkent choice. Wife had Turkey Rachel and that was also excellent.
We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I came here and got the daily special which was pot roast.

The first thing to arrive was the soup of the day which was \"bird's nest soup.\"  I'm familiar with the Chinese delicacy (no I probably would not be adventurous to eat it) but this was nothing like that at all.  It was like those dried Campbell's chicken noodle pouches that you have to add water to, plus some cubed chicken, a few carrots and some ground beef.  It was pretty disgusting -- super salty and a lot of the ground beef had gristle in it.

Next, after a slightly too-long wait came the pot roast.  It was a massive plate which had more gravy than actual food.  Very few pieces of pot roast that were pretty fatty, 3 slices of carrots, 3 mini-potatoes and a scoop of mashed potatoes.  Not sure why there were two types of potatoes but oh well.  Again, the vast majority of the dish was just gravy which wasn't that great.  At least the potatoes weren't salty.  Green beans and a small piece of cornbread were on the side.  The green beans were mushy like out of a can, but at least they weren't salty.  The cornbread was not good.

Aside from the soup nothing was really disgusting, but I wouldn't order the pot roast special again even if it was only $1.  I have to assume their other food is better though and I will probably give it a try."}
{"text":"First time here. I'd have given it another star, however the waitress seemed to be having a bad day and carried it with a bad attitude which resulted in poor service. The food was okay nothing to rave about. I have had a lot better from other diners. The best thing here was the cute cars/deco they had displayed around the diner."}
{"text":"Mary's Diner is what it is. Its a small hotel diner, the food is diner good, the servers were nice and we both had breakfast with coffee for $20. Can't beat that if your in Henderson."}
{"text":"I was on my way to ride my bike and hike near Lake Mead and I decided to do a little detour and have breakfast on Water Street in Henderson.  I daresay I haven't been on the street in 40 plus years.  The place I had bookmarked was closed so I walked across the street to the Eldorado Casino--owned by the Boyd Group--to have breakfast there.

Mary's Diner is a 50s kind of place with lots of memorabilia from the era.  This is so off the beaten path that I think all of the customers were locals.  This is not a destination casino.

I ordered the chili and cheese omelette.  It comes with breakfast potatoes and toast.  It was very good and very filling.  My server was Stacey and she was a delight!  

While eating, I enjoyed the music of that era playing on the loudspeakers.  I couldn't help but hum the tunes.  The music of my younger days!

This was a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The lady who seats you is extremely rude and abrasive! The waitress Stacy is slow and thinks she's funny but she's not! The food was cold and gross! I ordered eggs over hard and they were wet, hash browns were burnt and the place all around was dark and dirty! We won't be going back! This could be. Great local place to go but they need to do some employee make overs!"}
{"text":"The food is always okay here. I'll be honest the only reason I come is because they send me two for ones and $8 meal discounts in the mail. I'm only human lol. I don't think I'll ever be back again after my last visit. Let me first tell you I'm not a stranger here I spend thousands of dollars or should say I throw away thousands of dollars yearly and their adjacent Casino. I had not eaten all day and was famished. I ordered a chef salad and I asked the server to please toss it. She said she would. 10 minutes later she shows up with the salad and I said I'm sorry you forgot to toss it and she told me that the chef refused to do it? I asked if I could speak to a manager because I said I don't want it this way I'm just going to send it back. She said fine and then the chef came out. Nice guy but I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. He said that the waitress not the staff in the kitchen nor him refuse to toss the salad. I said she told me otherwise (but does it really matter?) He said they don't do it because when they toss it people often send it back for having too much dressing on it. I said well I promise you I won't send this back but I also promise you I'm sending it back right now because it's not the way I want it. So you have nothing to lose .  Make sense to you?  I guess it didn't to him. So he just took it back and apologized and that was the end of it. Am I missing something here? They're big fear is people are going to send back the salads which I ended up doing because they wouldn't toss it. I just hope Boyd Gaming reads this and that at least they're casinos are handled differently."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both ordered the breakfast special. The food was delicious. Well worth the money. Service is fast. Desiree is a great waitress. However, I had to cut my breakfast short due to a person they sat in the booth next to us who had the worst body odor I've ever smelled in my life. I'm not sure that it was such a great deal after all."}
{"text":"Images now opens at 11am so we wandered next door to Mary's and I'm so glad we did. The food was perfect and very inexpensive. Their customer service is outstanding. I asked if they had brewed iced tea and they did not. The server then asked if I wanted hot brewed tea & a cup of ice. He went out of his way and it was truly appreciated. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped here for a quick bite and we're pleasantly surprised.  Fast service and friendly people.Geneva was supper! Fries were HOT! That says it all. Mom had patty melt and she gives it a 10/10. Juicy and delicious. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger. Excellent! 
Prices are fair."}
{"text":"As you many know, I frequent the Eldorado Casino to play bingo with my Mom.  We get comped meals quite often (through my Mom's player's card).  I could easily make this a 4 star review, but just can't.

First of all, Mary's Diner has been here forever.  Eldorado celebrated it's 50th anniversary a couple of years ago (that's a LONG time in the same place).  Mary's Diner has probably been there the entire time! 

Anyhow, the restaurant was recently remodeled.  It used to be MUCH larger - they've cut back about half of the space, which I am not sure I understand.  They used to also have an all you can eat salad bar, which was also removed (surprising, because it was popular).  The biggest change though was the decor.  It is now a 50's style diner with old memorabilia all over.

The service is generally friendly and fast.  They really cut a lot of items from their menu.  They used to offer quite a few breakfast specials, which the older folks loved.  No more.  Now it's mostly burgers, fries and shakes with a few entrees thrown in.

The biggest disappointment is the closure of the snack bar and the food for the bar.  The snack bar got their food from Mary's kitchen and did steady business.  It was a great place to grab a quick sandwich (made to order), nachos, shrimp cocktail and they had the BEST soups (along with decent pizza and ice cream sundaes, among other things).  Now it's closed and they've moved the hot dogs to the bar along with the popcorn.  They offer pre-made sandwiches, but who knows how long they've been sitting there.  Unfortunately, the bar can be busy and it's tough for the bartenders to keep up with food orders.  You used to also be able to order food from the restaurant to be brought to your seat at the bar.  Now, you have to leave your machine (when it is busy, that can create an issue as another person could \"steal\" your machine) to pick up your food.  It's all very poorly organized - the one time I ordered, nobody was able to tell me when I would know my food was ready.

Overall, it's a decent place.  The food is good and the service is fast.  Prices are decent and they've worked out quite a few of the kinks since the remodel.  However, they could definitely make other improvements and they NEED to reopen the snack bar."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 4 stars because the prices are so cheap for the quality of food they serve you.  Service is friendly and fast.  Menu has a good selection.  You can't beat the specials.  Under $10 and you get a great meal.  Hard to beat."}
