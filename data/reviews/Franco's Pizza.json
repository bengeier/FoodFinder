{"text":"great pizza, Had lunch there today, I well be back. The pizza crest was the best in town,Price was great."}
{"text":"Great pizza very tasty sauce. Starting using them as my goto pizza place. Sucks they charge to deliver but guess times change."}
{"text":"chicken is great..we love the cara pie pizza extra thin so delisiouso!!"}
{"text":"Would not deliver to my house even though I only live 2.5 miles away. Kinda ridiculous considering lelulos right up the street delivers to my house and they are farther away. Anyway, pizza is decent as well as the Italian hoagie. The provolone sticks were horrible and the steak filling for the calzone was pretty weak too. Overall not bad for pizza and hoagies but wouldn't venture too far from that. Never tried their chicken but would like to, smelled amazing when I picked my food up."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent.  Crispy thick crust.  Owner is a character.  Nice small dining room.  We had a half sausage,  half pepperoni.  Totally hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today at 6:42 PM.....I had never had their pizza before, this was my 1st visit.....My cashier was a young dude, receipt says Myke, he was really nice, he took the time to describe their different crusts and the different ovens they are both baked in....I ordered 2 pizzas and an appetizer....he volunteered to look up my home address to see if (in the future) I could just call for delivery and he said that they could.....that's great! because I WILL order again ! The pizzas were great ! Loved it ! The crust, the sauce, the cheese, everything.....GREAT !  They have a really nice menu, I'm looking forward to trying other stuff. BTW, my pizzas were done fast, everyone I interacted with was super nice and polite....what a really nice place, and great pizza, I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"Used to work at the one in burton, where the glass shop is now and the one in Auburn, where sirnas is now. It was lots of fun to work there, but you're kinda a jack of all trades. Lol Frank is a very fun guy to be around and have as a boss. I admire that he prays with his employees too. Downsides to working there, it was kinda sketchy. Ran out of supplies a lot and oven didn't work very well. The way he paid us was sketchy. But pizza was always good."}
{"text":"I just visited this restaurant as a matter of fact I'm still sitting in front of it. I walked in said hello, and the worker just turned her back on me. I walked out called back to ask to speak to a manager and the manager gave me attitude. So I went back to the restaurant to asked to speak to the district manager or owner and this young lady said she was the owner's daughter and I asked her if I could speak to them and she said no. I am very disappointed at the customer service here. This was my first time visiting, and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I really tried to keep an open mind and tried Francos as I like to support local businesses.  I had avoided as I couldn't tell if they were open half the time, but turns out they were remodeling into a pizza + burger + hot dog place, but their website doesn't reflect same.  The inside is nice in the seating area, but the counter is cluttered and in need of removing most of the clutter.     I had pepperoni and a sausage pizza. In my whole life I don't think i have ever tossed a slice of pizza.   It happened.  And I wasn't the only one.  Buddies that shared pizza with me were of the same opinion.     The pros:  The crust.   Dough was airy on the ends but dense in the middle. and had the right amount of saltiness.  The middle of the pizza was pretty soggy though, but that may have been due to the grease or the dough was overproofed.   It could have used either a higher cooktemp or more cooktime.    Unfortunately that's all I have. **************************************** The cons:  Grease.  An exceptional amount of oil was used   The sauce was greasy, the dough was greasy, the box was greasy.  It was not a deep dish pizza, so not sure why so much grease.  I've been to chain pizza places (pizza hut) where grease is common, but even this eclipsed the grease to food ratio.  I don't get it.   Now, I am no stranger to greasy food but even this was above my tolerance ratio.  The sauce:  Bland, but had a very odd amount of seasoning in the middle of the pizza for some reason.  Like someone was adding italian seasoning to the pizza and the lid came off and it dumped on the pizza.  More is not better.   The cheese:  Was a tad sparse and did not seem like it's of the moisture quality to be \"stretchy\".  Cheese can be one of the costliest pizza toppings. Normally using skim/low moisture mozz isn't the best blend for pizza, but it is for shelf life.   I don't know what was on there but it did not do the job.  The toppings:   Pepperoni quantity was decent but really thin.  the sausage...I spit it out.   It might have been sausage that was cooked down and crumbled.  If so, not my favorite.  Bland, flavorless...i don't know what I was expecting but I did not like it.   It was small crumbly pieces.  I could not help but concentrate on the grease.  Where does that much oil come from , if not added?    Overall, maybe I got a bad run of pizza, or the sauce was a bad batch.  But, as reviews go, I calls em as I sees em.  Not saying I will not try again, and reviews can and do change.  One bad review does not sour me from a place, but this place literally left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Excellent little local pizza shop and the cara pie is a must!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, the sauce, the crust, the toppings  All terrific. Try this place you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all , 30.00 for 2 larges and 10 wings, pizza crust was extremely dense, no flavor.  Staff was courteous, but food not worth it"}
{"text":"For a town and are that has great pizza, this was my least favorite I have ever tried.  Right up the street and it always seems busy, but just wasn't my thing.  Original crust pizza is hard and difficult to eat.  Sauce had absolutely no flavor.  I don't think the provolone sticks I ordered were provolone.  But who knows since they were nothing more than store bought, frozen microwave specials.  Didn't try a sub or a soft crust pie, but don't see any reason to either.  Just up the street you can find better pizza in the gas station."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The crust, sauce, and fresh toppings are soooo good. He's won world pizza competitions and he's in our neighborhood. Please support this terrific local business."}
{"text":"Good pizza, sauce & crust have great flavor. Delivery always gets here quicker than expected."}
{"text":"The pizza is not good. The place is not clean. I miss Theresa's. It's a one man show and he can't handle it. Super messy, I will not go here again."}
