{"text":"Our favorite fish fry.  The friday fish fry menu has a lot of selections including non-fried options.  Great potato choices including yummy potato pancakes and baked potatoes that are actually baked in an oven.  The portions are huge and the price is a real bargain.
Try the mango vinaigrette on your salad.  Its awesome.
The service is excellent.  You have multiple waiters/waitresses so you never wait for anything.  Its really a great way to do things, especially when its packed.
They also have a very nice selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Ok I have not been there in a few years( since i moved away) but this is the best ever and I miss it terribly. Oh and the food rocks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great prices. Fish fries on Fridays make for a packed house. This is not a typical college bar either; patrons of all ages are present. It is a good location whether you are having lunch with a visitor to town, or an evening out with some friends. Try the cheese curds! Also, it is much bigger than it seems from the street (especially when they open up the back area). My one slight complaint is there seems to be a big difference between burgers cooked medium (bleeding) and medium well (burned). Do not order well."}
{"text":"Good prices, low key atmosphere.  Homemade chips are very addicting!  Try the Jordan burger, it's absolutely my fav.  Great for lunch.  Overall the best bar food in Madison.  Can be really crowded for games and the parking is mostly street.  Also great Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison, Wisconsin for many years, and had never even \"noticed\" the Big Ten Pub.  Driving by one Friday early evening my wife and I stopped in.  Very busy.  Very noisy.  EXTREMELY pleasant and helpful wait staff.  The chicken chili is the berst I've ever enjoyed.  Fish fry was very well done, and the potato pancakes were exceptional.  There is one turn-off however that may prevent from going back - -it may be a \"small thing,\" but to me it is important.  I have never, EVER been in a restaurant that made a charge for an extra small cup of tartar sauce, or sour cream.  NEVER! That says a lot to me about \"attitude\" - -my server explained as best he could, and I recognize it is not the server's fault.  It seems to me that the owner -- \"Jordan\" - -or management should IMMEDIATELY provide someone spending a minimum of $30-$40 per couple with an extra doo-dad or these sauces without charge and without question!  I run a business, and I've found that if I did something like this my clientele/customers would be rightfully outraged.  Good place, but this bothers me greatly.

{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Madison!  I lived nearby for years before going here, and it's much more than just a sports bar, even though it's a great place to watch a game.  There are tons of great options on the regular menu, and unlike most places, the specials are actually worth trying most of the time. My favorite dish overall is the sloppy Joe on Tuesdays, but I would recommend trying a lot of different choices on the menu, as it's all surprisingly high quality.  The staff are also all really friendly, helpful, and speedy.  The service is great!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best fish fry in the Madison and surrounding area period. On top of that, some of the best service I have ever had in my life. If you are looking for a fish fry you need to check this place out. Get their early as it fills up quick.

We go for the fish fry often, and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"This has become a favorite haunt of mine in my time as a UW student - this is one of my first suggestions when someone is looking for an easy, no-fuss place to get something to eat. 

This place gets pretty busy before Badger home games - football, men's basketball and hockey. The restaurant sets up a tailgate in their parking lot prior to home games at Camp Randall that's worth a stop. Yes, it's the usual brats and burgers type situation, but the beer selection is markedly better than any other tailgate you'll find on Regent. This is true for the rest of the year, too - the Big Ten has a great selection of beer on tap and in bottles. I love that they've always got something new to try, too. The bartenders are knowledgeable about what's in stock and always have great recommendations. 

As for the food - I've always been pretty pleased with my order. The Big Ten has osme interesting french fry selections, but they're sold a la carte. I've never really understood this menu arrangement, but they're delicious and worth the upgrade. I'm partial to the sweet potato fries with a raspberry dipping sauce, but many of my friends are hardcore wedge fry fans. 

The sandwiches, burgers, and fish fries are the stars on the rest of the menu. I've ordered the Turkey Reuben and Bacon Ranch Burger over and over and over again. The Friday Fish Fry is wildly popular with families and the community - plan to wait if you want to try and get a table around the dinner hour on Friday night. I'm always amazed at the size of the fish fry - as in, full length fillets of walleye on your plate. One of the best fish fries I've ever had -- and I'm a life long Wisconsinite."}
{"text":"The staff and culture was perfect. What a great place to just relax and have a FABULOUS burger! Staff was friendly and attentive. The food was DELICIOUS. Try the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. You won't be disappointed. :). And the background music was top 89s music. PERFECT!!"}
{"text":"So far this is the best fish fry I have had in Madison.  One of the main reasons is the options with the \"fry\".  They actually have two non-fried options which is nice.  

BTW, as an east coast guy and  I can't believe I am saying this, but the clam chowder is smashing.  Once of the best I have ever had.  Hearty with massive chunks of clam.  

If you are looking for a solid friday night FF, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I've been here for many Sunday football games, and a handful of times for lunch. The food is always pretty much a notch or two above what you'd expect at a college-town sports bar. The blackened ribbeye is always great-- so is the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. I can't NOT get Brocolli-Cheese bites, either. 

There are decent drink specials on Sundays, and it's a great place to watch football all day, with friendly bartenders and servers and a nice general atmosphere.

A few years ago, they seemed to cater pretty strongly to Bears fans, with the games on in the back room. It was pretty great. Recently, however, unless the Packers are on a bye, there is only one (or maybe two) TVs turned to the Bears, and there are a lot less Bears fans around. 

All in all, this is a really solid joint. It's the kind of sports bars that fake chain sports bars try to pretend to be. Know what I mean?"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go every 2 months or so for lunch. We always really enjoy the food except when they recently redid their menu and removed a few items. The service is always good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friday Fish-fry is the best .I go to a lot of restaurants looking for the best Friday night fish.  This one is one of the top contenders.  Our group started with the clam-chowder soup.  It was nice and warm - not too hot.  I ordered the perch with the sweet potato fries.  Our group also ordered the deep-fried cod and the bluegill.  I sampled all three and they all had great flavor.  I am partial to perch and I truly enjoyed every bite.  The fries were served with a special sauce that really brought out the flavor. We also got an order of the wedges and they tasted great also.  The portion size was more than we could eat, so we asked for a to-go box.

The price was very reasonable. The serving staff was top-notch.  We had no less that seven different servers stop and ask if everything was ok or for a quick fill of our water glass.   They have a good choice of beers on tap.  

Our group of Friday Fish-Fry travelers will be stopping here again soon."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars. But I was there on a Monday afternoon and the waitstaff seemed very inattentive to us. Always rushed, and not making eye contact when we ordered. Food is delicious and the drinks are great. Wish they had a better parking lot area."}
{"text":"Yes, I write a lot of reviews about Jordan's and their amazeballs food, drinks, and nightly specials. I recommend to everyone they come and I myself dine here once a week. No, I don't work here, but I would say Jordan's is my Cheers. After a blah day at work, totally turns my day around.  So my friends, if you like large portions of Wisconsin favorites cooked to order perfectly - dine wisely, dine Wisconsinbly at Jordan's Big Ten."}
{"text":"The food is actually very good at Big Ten Pub, but on game days they do have a limited menu which consists of very average stuff.   Football Saturdays can be a zoo, as well as during other sporting events such as the high school football playoffs.  If this is when you have gone to the Big Ten, you really did not get a good view of the place.

To really enjoy the GOOD food, take in their daily lunch specials or the fish fry on Fridays.  It is one of the best, if not THE best in Madison.  A true hidden gem.  Get there early or you won't get a seat!  

I have gone to Big Ten Pub for years and I have seen it under different owners, and I can say that the current ownership is excellent and the help is outstanding.  Great service... friendly and with an attitude!"}
{"text":"Jordan's Big Ten Pub is hands down the best sports pub on campus.  I have been here several times to eat and the food is always fantastic!  My favorite is the jerk chicken sandwich. A must try if you like spicy! The staff is always very friendly!  Great place for a game...or to just grab a drink and great food with a friend."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for Wisconsin sports! Every Badger game and Packer game, we always plan on going to JBT's to watch the game. The loaded nachos are amazing as well...get the nachos!"}
{"text":"I went here with one of my friends after we went to an Edgewood basketball game. Amazing ambience, very pub-like, with a well-lit section immediately as you walk in, but a dimmer and more casual seating area in the back with a dartboard and a pool table, which is fun when you're waiting for your food. 
Speaking of food, and for that matter, good food, Jordan's has no shortage. I ordered the Cajun spicy burger with jalapeños and caramelized onions, which was too hot for me, but if you're a fan of hot food, then I highly recommend it. I ended up taking bites of my friend's Bucky Burger, which is essentially just a BLT with a burger patty and cheddar. The burger buns are toasted well, and was actually a highlight of the burger.
The appetizers are plentiful, with french fries, seasoned french fries, mozzarella, cheese curds, nachos, chicken wings, mac and cheese bites? I've never even heard of that! And that's only like a third of the appetizer menu. There is also a cornucopia of salads, and a sandwich board, which also included hot dogs as well as sandwiches. They have pizza (which is limited, with only a cheese pizza option), chicken sandwiches, and of course a friday fish fry, which I haven't experienced, but have heard amazing things about. And finally, they have reubens. Traditional, Brat, Burger, Turkey are the Reuben options.
The service was excellent, a little slow, but with the good sized portions and amazing food, you shouldn't be complaining. If you're in the neighborhood, or even if you're not in the neighborhood, this is a great place to stop in. A word of warning before you go there, though, is the lot is tiny and there is limited street parking. Also, the outside is a little unappealing, with a billboard on top of it and grungy siding, but don't let that fool you on what's on the inside."}
{"text":"Friday nite at the Big 10.  Wonderful experience.  We arrived at 5:15, very busy but our friends already had a table.  I barely sat down and a server welcomed me and asked if I wanted a beverage.  Amazing how fast the service was considering the crowd.  This place knows what they are doing.  Now for the food, oh my what great fish.  Lemon pepper walleye, Cajun walleye, and cod, all excellent. The server really took the time to give us her attention.  A great time!"}
{"text":"Loved:
Fresh greens salad

Fish that did not get soggy after cooking it... The breading was crisp to the very end.

Watch out for:
The balsamic vinaigrette... is very vinegar-based... Use lightly or with caution.

The staff was very great at the beginning of the meal, but it took forever to get change for my bill.

The meal started off with a helpful wait staff TVs everywhere including in the booths and a little old fashioned sweet while I looked over the menu.

It was Friday night so I decided to go with the fish fry.  The lightly battered fish tasted so well with the tartar sauce that had a hint of horseradish.  I would have appreciated a spoon for my wild rice but that was not a big deal.  Overall the visit was great and I would definitely go back.  I would love it if they considered changing the drop ceiling and old school fans that they have running in the place."}
{"text":"I did not expect a bar on Campus avenue to have such good food!

They usually have a decent tap list. However the last time I was there, there was a Goose Island tap takeover so you are kind of screwed if you had another micro in mind on days like those.

Back to the food. Seriously, everything I've ordered here has been phenomenal bar food.

I had their version of the Monte Crisco special one night. The French toast was fluffy and delicately sweet, dusted in powdered sugar with thinly sliced ham and what reminded me of Emmentaler cheese.

The Brisket Burger...is...CLUTCH! Think, a thick beef patty, carmelized onions, slab of smoked brisket, finished with a honey mustard roux on a potato bun. Aaaahhhmazing!! The flavors transcends throughout, not one bite is wasted. The brisket is tender, with no sight of gristle. Upgrade to sweet potato fries for only $1.50 more.

They have Happy Hour Monday through Friday, daily specials, and Friday night Fish Fry.

Try anything, anything on the menu will be good!"}
{"text":"Last winter we moved to the Vilas neighborhood.  Lots of people mentioned that we should check out Jordan's-but we had always thought of it as a place to go after games to drink, not eat.  How wrong we were.  The food is so good (soups, burgers and especially the cajun walleye on Fridays).  The waitstaff, hands down, is the most friendly, team oriented, staff I've ever seen in any industry.  It sounds like I'm over selling, but it's true.  I will say that the blue gill was just OK-after tasting my husband's walleye-I now only order cajun walleye on Fridays. 

One night we got there around 8 pm.  It turns out the entire Badger football staff was there dining.  The kitchen was backed up, but the staff kept coming back to us, making sure we were taken care of with drinks, etc...until our dinner arrived.  Last Friday, we showed up again at 8 pm-and they were just reopening after a broken water main had caused them to close down for quite a few hours.  The entire staff just about cheered when our group of six walked in.  Drinks are good too-my friend's old fashioned was great, and I tried a mojito that was delicious."}
{"text":"This fish is HUGE! At 2-3 pieces, it's GOT to be the best deal in town for fish fry. And to top it off, it's pretty good too!

The beer battered is a wet batter, but the crust is a little lighter than some other beer batters I've eaten. A little oily, but it tasted good. This is their most popular fish. 4/5

The cornmeal perch. Not one of the top two fish our waiter told our group about, but still it was BIG portion (is this Ocean perch?!) and above average seasoning (I personally could have used  one more hit with the seasoning shaker). The cornmeal was obviously lighter than the beer battered, and I needed it as I worked that night. 4/5

The cajun crusted fish looked phenomenal! This was one of the top 2 recommendations, and I didn't get it (sad face). One of our group did and it just looked perfect: crunchy crusting and split up the middle from cooking just right. I can't account for taste as I didn't get a sample (sad face); the person who ordered it ate it all! 

The sweet potato fries are average. No crunch on the outside, just soft inside and out. Ok seasoning. 3/5

French fries - did not get to taste, but they are thick cut. Not my favorite style.

Onion rings! Of course I got these. I give ALL onion rings 5/5, I don't care if you let them sit in the Wisco winter cold and then dropped them on the floor in front of me. 5/5 These were still warm and good. 5/5

Slaw - wet, good mix of mayo to vinegar. 4/5

Beer selection looked great - but I had to work, so none for me.

Environment - large space, TV sports bar, near campus. 4/5

Parking - can be tricky, get there early, walk, or be frustrated. 2/5

Overall, Good fish fry!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood pub, dinner of choice when we feel like something cozy.  The food is awesome (and that kitchen is small!).  You have to be prepared for a college bar atmosphere, but that also means a great beer selection and good prices.  Their fish fry is one of the best in town and they also do great burgers and salads."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service, reasonable pricing. A perfect 10. I Had the avocado wrap w sweet potato fries @nd an Alaskan Amber beer to compliment this scrumptious dish. *Yum*"}
{"text":"Do not let the location down the street from Camp Randall or that it's a sports bar fool you, this place is wonderful. 

The first thing you need to know is that they have an amazing beer selection - both tap and bottle. It's constantly rotating - make sure you stop and check the chalk board inside the door to see what the new options are. 
They have Strongbow in cans, as well, which I love. 

They are always perfectly staffed - multiple people stop by the table, make sure you have a full beer and generally ensure you're good to go.

But the food is also pretty great. The menu is fairly expansive and there are always 5 or so specials of the day. The menu is mostly sandwiches and burgers, but the specials run the gamut from jambalaya or Cajun pasta to steak. The specials are always way more \"gourmet\" than your standard bar food. 

I love that the chef isn't content with putting out burger after burger and stretches the box with options. 

The menu has every type of sandwich, chicken sandwich, burger and panini you could want, plus a great list of appetizers. The nachos could feed 3 for dinner.

I love the BLT Club - it's great, standard, yummy comfort food. 

Always add the specialty fries - well worth the upgrade. 

And if any of that wasn't enough, they offer a free shuttle bus to and from the Kohl Center for events. We use it for Badger Hockey and it couldn't be better. They run 3 buses prior to the game at an hour and half hour before game time and a last one right at puck drop. Coming back, they're waiting out front and get you back to the bar and your car. 

No more waiting for parking or walking in the freezing Wisconsin winter. It's so convenient. They also let you take your beer on the bus. 

So glad someone pointed us in their direction."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Mac and cheese bits are a must. Had shrimp cajun wrap on special. Very good. Can't go wrong with anything on menu."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: Regent Street's neighborhood bar.

Jordan's Big Ten Pub will always hold a special place in my heart, and my gut. I've been here more times than I could count over the years. It's an unassuming bar from the street, but it's pretty large inside and holds prime real estate.

Friday fish frys are great, pub food is standard, and I'm partial to their chili. The clientele can vary greatly day to day, even hour to hour. Weekends can be packed with the boomers reliving their Badger glory days, weeknights see college kids throwing them back, and football gamedays...try to smoosh in the parking lot through the thousands of other people there.

The bartenders are always friendly and accomodating, and are eager to get on a first-name basis for regulars. The beer is always cheap and the other specials are worthwhile. 

There are TV's everywhere, even in some booths. I love that they have a small pool table ($1.50) and two dart boards ($1/person). 

Jordan's is exactly what a bar should be: inviting, friendly, and cheap. Is it a destination bar? No. But if you're a local and want a place to hang out with friends, Jordan's has you covered. Hands down my favorite bar in Madison."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while looking for a dinner option near the field house before a volleyball game. Reviews were spot on. Loved everything about it. Great atmosphere, great burgers, beer selection and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The homemade pistachio vinaigrette was delicious. Large portions for big eaters."}
{"text":"Really great place!  My family and I came here on a Tuesday night. It was slow, and we were able to pick our own table. 

Our server was so friendly!  He was charismatic and offered menu suggestions, which was rather extensive menu for a bar and grill. They also had good drink specials going on that night, $3 taps and $3 vodka mixers. 

I went with the pesto chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. Best sweet potato fries I have had in a long time!! And the sandwich so delicious. The bread it was served on was amazing, nice and crispy outside and soft on the inside. The pesto and mozzarella on the sandwich was to die for. Melt in your mouth delicious. 

Would definitely like to go back, I hear they have a good Friday fish fry!!"}
{"text":"In search of a Fish Fry, we found Jordan's Big Ten Pub and soon learned that this establishment offers so much more then any review could ever describe.  The fish fry was awesome.  I can't really say if it was the \"best\" I had ever had being that I opted to order the Cajun baked Walleye (which I've never even seen offered at any other fish fry). 

This place makes all of their own salad dressings and the chipotle vinaigrette should be bottled and sold.  I would buy the first case. They also make their own salsa - which was a perfect medium spiciness. Dessert were fresh made cupcakes - Side car cupcake, mojito cupcake, and a brandy old fashion cup cake. I'm not into desserts that much, but my dinner date loved these.

Finally, the bartenders.  They were awesome.  Heavy handed and knowledgeable, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Three of us visited Sunday night, on way to St. Paul. Waiter was very helpful with suggestions. Nacho appetizer was large and tasty. Rib eye dip was very good, red pepper, pulled pork panini was very good, but the brisket burger was a little dry and had too much bun. Excellent beer selections. A near four star rating, but not quite there based on what we ate."}
{"text":"First it's a party bar. I give it 5 stars because of all the free stuff given out by different vendors. Captain Morgan's passed out tons of free shots, shirts socks and other items. Really cool outdoor place for pregame fun."}
{"text":"The fried cod, potato pancakes, and clam chowder was some if the best I've had.  And the price was extremely reasonable.  I'm looking forward to going here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I are regulars at Jordan's for games.  Awesome place to watch if you are a Badgers or Packers fan, and even if not the crowds are still tolerant in a fun way.  (A Vikings fan was booed, but not in a mean way.)  Plenty of TV's.
Food is very good pub food - burgers, chips, some of the best nachos in town as they melt the cheese at the halfway full point and then again on top.  REALLY amazing considering they have such a small kitchen.
But the service is really the story here.  They have plenty of servers on staff and they are really attentive and friendly.  And their prize drawings are a hoot.  
Stop by for a game and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"WHOOO midwest express this was it!  My friend was meeting me in town for work, and she was hungover and I was HUNGRY and this was by the hotel.   We got a nice big, warm booth to spread out in.  Our server was SO nice, she checked on us multiple times and even let me change my order when I saw how amazing it looked.  We got  a large fry, which was a MOUNTAIN, cheese curds, I got a buffalo chicken salad, and a bloody mary.

Let me tell you about this bloody mary.  It had jerky, cheese stick, asparagus, olives, and onions in it.  And it was SPICY and AMAZING.  The salad was HUGE and what I needed.  This would be my local JAM if I lived here."}
{"text":"My friends are regulars at BTP and as such, introduced me to the fact that Big 10 is more than just a great sports bar, they are a great place for food!  I've never had a bad experience with their menu but this Friday was the first time we were there specifically for the fish fry.   The place was packed with the Wisconsin Boys High School Basketball championship games going on at the Kohl's center, even the back bar was open.  Yet we still got a table, we had impeccable service and the food was outstanding.

I was with a group of six and we had the shrimp, the blackened baked walleye and the beer battered cod.  Nothing but praises from the group.  I personally had the cod and their batter is mouth watering beer batter at its best.  Not greasy, crispy and just simply delicious.  The onion rings and fries were great too.  

BTP will continue to be a favorite of mine for sporting events and just a good quick meal and a drink with friends but now it gets added to the best Fish Fry list as well!"}
{"text":"Came in on a slow summer night and it was hotter in here than it was outside. Bugs were flying around everywhere. The beer selection was unimpressive, and the whole place just felt sticky and dirty.

The bartender, however, was friendly and especially accommodating considering I had a friend who couldn't speak English trying to place an order.

Get a better air conditioner in here, and hire a janitor to mop the floor already."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with the best food and friendliest staff in Madison. We have been going here for over a decade and it is my favorite restaurant in Madison. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as I have some Madison buddies that like going here.  Plenty of TVs here, so it's a great place to watch a game.  Even at the booths you get a little TV screen.  There's always some interesting to try on tap here as there are plenty of craft beers.  I like the food here too as it's basically bar food but one step above regular bar food. The one thing I don't care for is if you go there late on a weekend, it's full of college students.  Sorry bros I'm not into the college drinking scene anymore."}
{"text":"A bar on Regent Street that has 5star quality food, I didn't think it was possible until I stopped at Jordan's.  Great food, burger the quality of a fine restaurant, not your usual frozen factory burger found at a college sports bar.  There homade salad dressing very good and the homade sauces that each signature burger has is a perfect compliment.  The food is thought out and the attention to mixing/blending flavors is amazing.  Ordered 3 Brisket burgers Medium, I would have given 5 stars but 1 of the 3 burgers was way over cooked the other 2 were perfect."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere any time of the year. Go for the burgers, wings, melts, tacos, fish fry, or almost anything else they have to offer because the quality is always top notch and even on the busiest days you will get prompt service."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, and the price is right.  Go see Kim.  She's a sweetheart.  I highly recommend Jordans for a good time."}
{"text":"How did I ever miss this place? Probably because I usually avoid places with limited parking. However, this place is worth the struggle! Everything was delicious! We ordered the Papas Fritas and I think about these Mexican Street Corn smothered fries on a regular basis. We also ordered the Pork Banh MI, Pesto Grilled Cheese, and the Bacon & Ranch Chicken Panini. All of these were delicious and huge. 

Check it out! The menu has something for everyone, you don't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The bluegill fish fry was very lightly breaded and didn't overpower the fish at all, very good! The coleslaw and tartar sauce is about average, the cinnamon apples are good. Lost points for price ($16), the potato pancakes were extremely greasy, and while the fish was excellent will probably go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I went 2 weeks ago for the first time for their Friday's fish fry.
This place is as Wisconsin as it gets: sports bar, nice beer, fried stuff.

I got the walleye with wedge potatoes and it was really nice: soft in the inside, crispy on the outside.
I believe it was 11 dollars. I would this place 5 stars, but the beers are quite pricey for a divey place.

I should come back sometimes for their happy hour when the drinks are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It has now become my favorite chill spot weather after work or on my day off. Staff is incredible. Service is superb and amazing. My girlfriend and I love the atmosphere the music & it just is awesome"}
{"text":"Love Jordan's Big Ten Pub! Great menu with lots of choices. The food is always delicious and well-priced. Can't go wrong with the blackened salmon salad and their fish fry is always great. Amazing staff and service."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place to go before Badger women's volleyball match on a Friday night to replace the Stadium Bar. Came across Jordan's and gave it a try. I chose it after seeing the HUGE menu online and how close it is to Camp Randall and the Fieldhouse. Wow! We each had a different seafood meal and each was great. Mahi Mahi stew special and salmon sandwich were perfect. Service was incredible even tho it was super busy on a sports night. Colin and Jake were around frequently to make sure everything was just right. Super value for the money, reasonably priced. You'll make it one of your Badger pre or post-game favorites!"}
{"text":"You are wrong if you think that this pub is only surviving on it's proximity to the football stadium.  We stopped here on Easter weekend.  There was no football crowd around and the Master's Golf Tournament was on the TV.  This pub could survive in any of the suburbs of Minneapolis.  The beer menu was large enough to be overwhelming.  I found two good ones that served me well.  The food was excellent.  I had a cajun burger with sweet potato fries and my lovely bride had a chicken cordon bleu that she raved over.  Servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"We went there for Friday fish fry- the bluegill was good, but the perch lacked seasoning. Potato pancakes were very good and the tarter sauce was different but also very good. Chicken chili was excellent - sweet and spicy, but not too much of either. Service was also very good,"}
{"text":"My 1st time here is on Mardi Gras! The special menu was outrageous!  Smelled great, tasted even better. Service was good, a little slow at times, but not worth getting upset over. The selection of beverages was smsll, but adequate for any occasion."}
{"text":"This place is always surprisingly good with so small a kitchen. Its  sort of like a supper club but no lazy Susan's or cheese dip. Ha, remember those? Had the fish fry this time and was given lots of choices. You can get cod with the beer bater or a light dusting batter which I got. Lots of cod and fries and even cold slaw for 13 bucks. My wife got bluegill with some funny pancakes that she loved. She should, that was 18.50. Drinks are reasonable and and the noise isn't too bad. Sure it's tough getting a table at prime time but if you go a little later, say after 7:30 the crowd thins out fast like most Madison places. It's the one place you can usually count on for good food and service in a bar like atmosphere. It's in the campus area so theres  a big mix of people and on game nights big crowds so plan ahead.  If you've never been there give it a shot. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For what it is, a pub with good food, this place is a 5 in my book.  

Service was great.  Friendly, fast, attentive server.  Food came out very fast and was very hot. Good beer selection. 

Got the fried cod.  Came with a nice salad, which was actually quite good (not crappy iceberg lettuce) and a homemade ranch dressing.  The cod was nice and fresh (no freezer burn).  Not overbreaded.  A bit greasy, but then again it was FRIED cod.  

My companion got the bistro burger which was really good.  Ordered medium and it came out medium.  Fresh motz, caramelized onions, and an amazing garlic aioli.  The sweet potato fries came with this really interesting raspberry dipping sauce.

Beer was priced average to slightly high ($5 and $6 for nice beer).  Food was very inexpensive for how good and fresh it was.  

I will be going back again and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends on a Monday and was very pleased.

They had $1 rail mixers, which was full of win.  Usually cheap drinks mean little liquor and lots of soda.

This was definitely not the case, each drink was at least 1/2 liquor or 3/4 liquor and a splash of soda.  It makes me wish that I had Tuesday off because for 6-7 bucks you could have a hell of a good time.

Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to have a fun time on a Monday night or just tip back a few with some good company.

The only thing I can't comment on is the food, although I've heard a lot of good things and wouldn't mind going back on a Monday to get some grub and then some drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place for game days and have enjoyed their fish fry a time or two- I love the Lemon Peppered Walleye"}
{"text":"I have not tried the food yet, but the staff here was great. They have a full bar with enough taps to satisfy most drinkers. I like the layout of the place. It has a nice front area with seating and the pool room is great as well. 

I was impressed with the vibe and quality of service. I plan to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Came here to watch Game 4 of the NBA Finals. Let me dispel any misconceptions about Jordan's. The food is okay, borderline meh. The TVs are small, but there are a bunch by the bar. The beer selection is decent, and some of the games are broken. 

Despite some of its shortcomings, this place makes for a decent spot to catch a game, knock back a few beers, and play some darts or pool. If you have the time to eat beforehand, do that, because the entree items left a bit to be desired. We struck up a conversation with the bartenders and they were pretty fun to bullshit with. 

Will look elsewhere to see if better options exist next time."}
{"text":"Beware the 2-for-1 Long Islands-night!  They've created many horror stories among me and my friends.  They're not 1/2-priced, mind you--you'll get two when you order one!  Hold on, it'll be a bumpy ride.  ;)

It's divey in a douchey way, but I'm not horrified by it.  It's good for cheap beers, especially if you get a booth before it gets too crowded."}
{"text":"A game day tradition, a short walk to Camp Randall so you can meet up with friends and enjoy drinks before the game. The outdoor area is always packed on game day but the bartenders keep things moving and you don't have to wait very long. Other than the game day fun, it is an average bar and kind of getting grungy looking inside so it isn't some place I would go otherwise."}
{"text":"Big Ten has consistently good food. Good burgers, fish fry, etc. I've never had room for dessert, but I've heard their desserts are great. Their staff is also amazingly friendly! This is the type of place that really feels homegrown. I was glad I lived near Big Ten while in college. It was especially nice during the winter when we wanted to go out, but didn't want to walk far.

This place is also excellent for getting a drink. They have a mixture of taps from both Wisconsin and around the country...oh, and domestics too. Drink specials are good too."}
{"text":"here is another place that deserves another half star.

I visited Jordan's on a Friday evening, around 8 pm and found a nice place at the bar.  Now understand I have been to Jordan's during football season, outside, with the crowds and expensive cheap beer.  Never would I have considered this anything but possible good bar food.

Wrong!!!!!

I had a friend at work tell me about it and about their Friday night fish fry, so I ventured to Regent St for a try.  First the menu for fish fry is tremendous with multiple options.  I chose the Cajun Walleye with potato pancakes and it was excellent.  The fish is grilled/baked, not deep fried with Cajun spices that provide heat but does not over power you.  The fish was cooked to perfection, easily broken apart with a fork.  My first venture into potato pancakes, it will not be my last.  The side of cole slaw was amazing as well, a slightly sweet flavor which is what I prefer.  The amount of food was just right for a hungry adult (skipped lunch) although I sawr someone the deep fried fish and it looked to be too much for one sitting.

And then there was the beer!  Great draft beer selection with a couple selections I have not seen previously; Untitled Art Hazelnut Imperial Stout and Ale Asylum Biablo Belga Belgian Dubbel.  Both were fantastic!

I might need to go again tonight to try their regular menu and report back."}
{"text":"I work close to Jordan's, so I eat there at least once a month for lunch.
I recommend going there on a Friday and getting the fish fry with clam chowder soup! Some of the best clam chowder soup I have ever had. Great!

This place is fairly priced and is usually pretty popular for lunch. Service is good, and food always comes out hot.

A overall great UW atmosphere. Packed for UW games and events!

I have also tried sandwiches, the burgers, and chicken strips. All great. I have ordered fries, onion rings, and homemade chip's complaints. 

They have some parking, just watch out pulling in, the driveway is higher than the road and I have seen at least 10 cars on different occasions pull in and crack their bumper or scrape up the bottom of their cars."}
{"text":"Food was great, huge portions and wonderful service!!! They make their own creamy parmesan basil ranch sauce for the wedges ,, a must try!!"}
{"text":"We read that this was the best place to tailgate before the badger game, and while it was decent, there are definitely better places to go. Positives were a fair number of bartenders, lots of space, and the option to get a Bloody Mary. The things we didn't like....well first of all when we went inside the restaurant it smelled like straight up drunk college kid. Kind of a combo of urine, stale beer, and cheap perfume. It definitely steered us away from ordering the food outdoors (which originally looked terrific). There also was a large amount of bees, which in some respects can't be helped, but also wasn't a problem at the other stops we made. Not a bad beer selection, but other areas have more available."}
{"text":"This place is a Madison game day staple. The only problem is that this is the case for hundreds of people (and that may be modest). If you are into ass to elbow people, but an incredibly good time, this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and all the food is great.  There are several daily lunch specials to choose from every day and a selection of two soups.  On Fridays, they offer a wide variety of fish options for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"As you can see by my number of check ins, I am no stranger to Jordan's!  The reason I keep coming back is not only because of the food (always excellent) and beer selection (rotated often and have a great variety) but the friendly staff-a perfect trifecta.  Beyond their regular menu and amazing fish fry, check out their daily specials."}
{"text":"I should start by saying, I don't typically care for sports bars. The food is decent, they have some games in the back, but the real reason for me to come here is the tap selection (and it's around the corner). They always have a good selection of local and regional brews (typically something from bell's, capital, lake louie, new glarus, etc. on tap and more in bottles). 
Oh yea, and the bus to the Kohl Center events (like basketball) comes in handy too..."}
{"text":"So my buddy (a U of I Illini grad) and I (an SIU Saluki grad) decided to go to a University of Wisconsin basketball game. I am a college coach myself so college sports is my passion. Although my buddy was all about breweries, I wanted to go to a hot spot college bar/restaurant. We both wanted to eat something that you can't eat in Chicago. I looked online and it looked like this was the hot spot college bar with great food and above all else, local breweries and craft beer. Score! Plus Spotted Cow for 3.00 during happy hour and after the game? Score! And we both had the Bucky (U of W mascot) Burger which was awesome! You can order how you want your meat and their meat is fresh from the local butcher. Come on man!!! Then I asked the bartender how far the game is from the bar and if we can leave our car there and use Uber or walk there. His response? \"We actually have our own shuttle to the game and back.\" DOUBLE QUADRUPLE SCORE!!!\" This place is 5 stars plus!! This is a place for alumni, students, college coaches who want chill and I highly recommend this place if you want that college sports experience with great beer, food, and service! FYI a spotted cow beer case in Illinois is like a million dollars so we were shocked that is was that cheap as a special on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Some of the best sweet potato fries I have ever had! The fried pickles are pretty fantastic as well. Both were especially good with the homemade sauces: house spicy yellow mustard and pablano aioli. 
As vegetarians, we were worried the limited selection would make this bar less than enjoyable, but our expectations were exceeded! I imagine that the rest of the food, meat or otherwise, is just a great!"}
{"text":"Holy christ, this place was packed for the Badgers! It wasn't easy to get around, but the staff manning the drink and food counters were quick and friendly. 

Pricing was really good for the location and game time, and the food was pretty decent, too. I'd like to check this place on another night just to see what a normal crowd is like."}
{"text":"The Friday Night Fish Frys never disappoint!! The beer batter is not heavy like so many fish frys, and the cod is tender and flaky. The fact they have Spotted Cow on tap just adds to the \"awesomeness\". Prices are super reasonable too!! Always look forward to visiting Jordan's whenever I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Finally tried Jordan's BTP fish fry after my husband has raved about it for years.  He definitely did not steer me wrong.  I tried the cajun walleye, he tried the perch and we both chose the seasoned wedge fries as our sides.  Everything was delicious and the portion sizes are pretty large (like other reviewers mentioned).  We could each only polish off half our fries.  The servers are friendly and quick.  It seems they also have awesome happy hour specials because my husband's mud puppy porter was only $3 for a pint.  I'd love to try some of their non-fish fry menu.  The only thing I found a bit odd was there are no prices on the fish fry menu.  Everything ended up being very reasonable ($16 for walleye dinner, $13 for perch), but I kind of like to know what I'm paying before I order - must be the Wisconsin in me!"}
{"text":"I love Jordan's, it truly is a hidden gem! Very casual setting, it's your typical sports pub with GREAT food and friendly staff. You seat yourself and there are always daily specials and drink specials. It's very dim compared to Lucky's across the street but they have the best food around! The burgers are great, and salad dressings are made in house. The buffalo wings are also delicious. Monday night is Taco Night and Thursday is Wing Night -- but make sure to come early as it gets pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Large portions that hit the spot. The boyfriend and I walked into the bar and were immediately greeted by a very welcoming and kind barista who seated us and promptly took our orders.

The cheese curds dipped in hot chili chipotle sauce are a must have. Very crunchy outside with a delicious gooey inside!

The tuna ahi BLT was pretty good although I thought the bacon overshadowed the tuna a little too much. The Cajun chips and French fries were both super crispy and well seasoned.

The bar itself has a very nice and intimate feeling to it. We went for lunch but I could imagine having a relaxing Saturday evening enjoying a beer and watching a game or two here. Overall, the atmosphere is casual and the food is solid."}
{"text":"Okay, here's a review that I've been putting off for a couple of years now.  Not because I couldn't find the perfect words.. just plain complacency on my part..  

Fortunately I have a wicked good memory when it comes to good burgers so I can recall enough to FINALLY do this review and get it out of my \"Bookmarks.\"  

First off it's near the UW campus....The other UW (Wisconsin)....The atmosphere was your typical college campus pub, TV's and UW paraphernalia all over the place etc...and your typical Pub faire and of course BEER!  
The menu was huge, from what I can remember anyways, with lotsa choices.....good for the drunk college student who can't make up their mind.
Portions, were just as big!  Good for the college student who  brings a friend who ran out of money because he/she spent it all on beer and doesn't have money to buy their own food.   Mound-o-fries and a decent sized burger made w/Wisconsin grown beef.  I remember that because I almost didn't finish it and was considering taking the rest of it back to Washington with me along with the huge-ass steak I couldn't finish the night before.....I sucked it up though and finished it washing it down with a bottle of Bud-light.  

Now I don't know what the place is like on a Friday night or Game day because I was there for lunch with some business associates, but it was a comfortable place, the kind of place that if it was at the UW.....our UW (Washington), I'd probably frequent it, and the burger that I ordered would be my regular thing.

So to all you Bucky Badgers!  Ya got a good place going here....sorry about the NCAA tourny BTW...I was rootin' for y'all."}
{"text":"Their chili is really good. Great salads and beer. Taco night is Monday."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood to go to a sports bar this is definitely my first choice in Madison!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish fry and service! Great value for the dollar. Just watch the parking signs on Regent! Turned a $20 meal into a $130 meal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding.  Food is always very good and the service is outstanding.  They make an extraordinary effort in terms of service, it is clearly part of their business model for success.  Do not let the fact that this seems like a college bar fool you.  It is a great place for lunch or Friday fish fry, and absolutely family friendly.

Best Friday fish menu and food in Madison.  Options include lightly breaded lake perch & cod, grilled walleye prepared two ways, and salmon.  Incredible potato pancakes if you desire, and a tremendous new england clam chowder.  You will never get a clam chowder with more full sized clams, anywhere.  

Just try it once and see for yourself.  

No reservations and they don't take your name, you just stand around and wait for a table to open. The system works really well, and people acknowledge and respect the order you came into the restaurant.   

By the way, never park in the small lot, it is a pain.. Just park on the street."}
{"text":"Food is entirely meh but service is top notch. Cajun walleye + sweet potato fries: bones in fish, fries cold. Carolina burger and fries: burger bland, tasteless and not medium as ordered (came out well done), entirely average, fries cold. When we complained about cold fries we were promptly served fresh. We ate at the bar and weren't impressed with what we saw coming out of the kitchen. No real reason to return. Now we know."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cajun chicken sandwich with Cajun chips and man was it good!!

Great food, food presentation and friendly staff!

Chicken was seasoned just right and chips had a little heat to it, as it should."}
{"text":"This place rocks, BIG TIME!

I used to come here at least once a week when I lived about 4 blocks away. Once I moved, I didn't really ever go back. It's kinda sad, because in the last month I've been back three times and I've totally been missing out.

That was 3 years ago and their menu and cooks, I think, have changed for the better. The food is really quite good for a bar and the portions are enormous. Prices are super reasonable. I recommend the fried chicken sandwich, it's unhealthy, but it's bar food.  

The service has always been extremely attentive and friendly. Also, one good thing about this place is that they have consistantly carded me through the years even last week and I'm 33. This is good because it keeps out the unwanted young crowd of which I was once a part of.

They also have very cheap nightly drink specials.

Keeping in mind that it's a sports bar, it has a very solid 4 Stars.

Hooray!"}
{"text":"Best bar food you will ever have. Great atmosphere for any and all sporting events, and service has always been timely and never had a problem with server or what I've been served. Couldn't be happier. Going there more and more for their extensive menu... also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"they have shuffleboard.  that's about it.  good wisconsing tradition.  like curling, but without the produciton."}
{"text":"Solid place with a great selection of beers.  TV's everywhere  with a game of some kind on (Even some of the booths have them).  Watched my broncos play there; I'm sure its a blast when the Packers games are on.  Go for the fish fry on Fridays.  The clam chowder is a solid choice.  Only complaint was the wait staff was almost too attentive (come by too often to ask if you need anything) which can get a little annoying but is far better than having a non-attentive staff.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was too good to take a picture. Ordered this on a whim for carryout because I was craving a burger and fries. After INHALING the Bistro Burger, I don't know if I'll go anywhere else the next time I have the (weekly) craving. The burger was huge and cooked to perfection with awesome flavor. Fries were also excellent. I'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Staff are awesome!  New menu is exciting to see. Had the chicken dumpling soup which was well seasoned with tender white meat pieces and carrots. The new cheese board ($15) had large portions of over-grilled white bread, yellow and white but unnamed cheeses, and a mushroom pate. I'd prefer smaller portions of unique or adventurous things. The bread could be swapped out for interesting crackers or pita. Some vegetable matter or crisp apples would also enhance the crunch factor. The tap list is pretty good and their merlot has nice body with a hint of spiciness that makes it tasty fun. We will undoubtedly v"}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will ever eat here. We came in for a late lunch, there were not very many people there at all. It took over a 1/2 hour to get our food. I got the drunkin brisket pannini and the meat was all fat. It was a complete waste of money, never again."}
{"text":"In love Jordan's Big Ten Pub. I lived in the Vilas neighborhood for about 5 years and frequented Jordan's often! I'm sure most people think a bar wouldn't have great, quality food but this one does!!!
Their fish fry is very good- not greasy at all! They have taco night (i believe on wednesdays) where you can eat inexpensively and deliciously. Their standard menu is wonderful and there are always unique and tasty specials.  I'd also recommend the soup! It is made fresh daily and is always satisfying.  The salads at Jordan's are amazing! Often times you order a salad out and it's a bunch of shredded iceberg with a crouton, not here! They use good lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and tons of other toppings depending on what you ordered. It's not on the menu but I often order a cajun chicken bacon ranch sandwich and it is to die for! 
Also, I can't forget to mention the staff! They are really friendly, hard working and attentive (even on the busiest days). If you get Kimmy or Lacy as your server you are extra lucky!!!!
My husband and I have moved away from the area but we still try to make It to Jordan's a couple times a year. We even stopped there after we thought I was going into labor. Luckily it was a false alarm and we got to eat at Jordan's Big 10 Pub...because you can't waste a trip to the Vilas area without stopping there!!!"}
{"text":"SO MANY DAILY, I repeat DAILY, DEALS!! My personal favorite is the 65 cent wing deal on Thursday nights accompanied by 1.50 domestic taps! It is a great atmosphere for both pre-games and game days. On non-game days though, it is a great place to just hang out and talk since it's not as rowdy or loud. Their White Cheddar Cheese Curds and Duck Wings are crowd favorites. You can never go wrong with their Cajun Seasoned Potato chips which goes really well with their ranch dressing! They also offer a variety of burgers, and some nights they have half off burger deals. My personal favorite is  the Garlic Rib Eye Steak Sandwich! Pro-Tip: ORDER ALL THE APPETIZERS for an awesome game time experience!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick appetizer and to catch the end of a soccer match. I had the mini corn dogs with onion rights. Pretty standard, but the onion rings were crunchy and seemed homemade, not frozen. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating when I asked them to turn the sound on for the match. A good place for food or to catch a game."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a game -- my routine is to tailgate on Lathrop and stumble to the Stadium Bar to watch the game -- but I have been here a couple times for lunch and enjoyed it.

The food is actually really, really good and the service was very friendly.

I'm not sure what they did to spoil Keith Charles' experience, maybe being from southern Cali he's just out of touch with Wisconsin, whatever the case may be I think his two star rating was overly harsh. It's no 5-star sports bar, but it's certainly no 2-star dive either.

Between the truly spectacular, albeit traditional, bar food and their great list of beers, this is a great place to belly up and enjoy the company of your crew."}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever had a bad experience here, whether pregaming for a Wisconsin football game or watching a game while having something to eat with some adult beverages.

Tonight I stopped in looking for a quick bite after teaching a late class. I am glad I did. I had Pam's Famous Sloppy Joe, about which I never heard tell.

It was simply the best sloppy joe I've ever tasted, and I've eaten at the original Sloppy Joe's in Key West. The beef seemed to be almost a ground up brisket. It reminded me of a barbecue brisket sandwich only sweeter. Ironically, the sauce was thick enough that it was not that sloppy!

As usual, the staff was courteous and the service prompt. I might have to get a job to learn the recipe"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a little biased here.

I go to Jordan's at least twice a week. It's a great place to get a quick lunch (right around the corner from my office), or have an after-work beer... or just stay there all night and get drunk on their home-made long island ice teas.

1) The Legend is the most friendly server I've ever met. He's nice, always happy to see his regular customers, and has never made a bad recommendation.
2) Keesha is another super friendly, always smiling server. She never says no to a special order.
3) Collin makes infused vodka and really great specialty cocktails. Also very nice. I see him at Indie coffee before work every once in a while.
4) All the Jennifers - also very friendly, always alert, and pays attention to empty drink glasses.
5) EVERYONE ELSE that works there. I think it's because they all look like they enjoy working there. It makes me and my crowd feel welcome. Of course, they make sure others are enjoying their time there too, so they tell us to quite down before we make anyone too upset. It's actually really appreciated.

So the service is top notch and for an out-of-towner, this is one of the few places I feel like I'm at home. The food is equally great. I never look at their regular menu anymore (mostly because I've practically memorized everything on the list). I've never regretted an order off their daily specials. In addition, their beer list changes weekly, if not more frequently. I love it. Did I mention their homemade long island iced tea?

The bar gets filled up pretty quick, but I've never had to wait more than ten minutes for a table. They also have a back-bar for when it's super busy and a parking lot as well. 

ALSO! They have customer appreciation nights where they have a giant buffet for FREE!!!!!!!!!! And drinks too. I don't know any other restaurant/bar that does that. I love this bar. I do."}
{"text":"Amazing food with big portions so I usually have leftovers to enjoy the next day.  I live nearby so I come here frequently.  I think I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have never had something I've disliked.  Bartenders/wait staff are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"So underrated!!!

I live two blocks from Jordan's and have been going to football pregame a there for two years, but what's remarkable is their food! Local, good quality, delicious, huge selection... I cannot say one bad thing about this place. KEEP IT UP!"}
{"text":"If ever there were a place that needed a 10 point scale to properly represent the food, atmosphere and service, Jordan's Big 10 Pub would easily earn a 10.  Friday fish fry, real Wisconsin fried cheese curd, clam chowder, cold beer, cajun walleye, potato pancakes, and cookie dough cheesecake for dessert.  What a way to recover from a 7 hour drive. Just plain Wisconsin awesome!"}
{"text":"It's about time I chime in on this kickin' Pub. This is The Pub, done right. It's big, it can handle large groups, the food is excellent and plentiful, happy hour rocks and there are plenty of big screens for viewing whatever sportsball you like. It's so excellent, when my daughter, S.I.L  and grandkids were in town recently, she wanted a brat, he wanted onion rings and the bobs wanted anything fried so ... in we went for an early lunch. They have a great kids menu, one of my 3yo g'kids loves olives and after eating the olives from both Bloody Marys, the waitress brought him a little cup with several more.

JBTP is near where I work and many work-related after work get togethers are here. They've never let us down. Note that on Game Days, it's a mob scene but, what isn't on Regent on Game Days."}
