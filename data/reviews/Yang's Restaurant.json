{"text":"Yang's hopefully can be a long term restaurant here as they have a simple concept which fits great with the elderly husband and wife crew. The Menu headings is easy to read with the most popularly known Northern Chinese. The items under the main headings however has a decent amount of options for your consumption pleasure within your Dumpling, Bun, or Noodle dishes. 

Fresh Pork Chinese Cabbage with Mushroom Bun($6.99/fried) was sold to us by the lovely friendly women that spoke fried is more tasty. Maybe she was just trying to upsell for the extra dollar? Not my specialty food but it had all the elements and wasn't over seasoned while the fried did give it a bit more crispiness to compliment the natural chew of the soft Bun. 

#49 Esoteric Pork Noodle in Soup($6.99) really stands for House Specialty Da Lu Noodles. It's not your typical version as it has a darker color while lots of Shitake Mushrooms give the lightly starched Egg Drop Soup some Mushroom flavouring. The NOODLE is the star of this dish as it was cooked to chewy consistency. 

Pork Chinese Cabbage Dumpling($5.99/steam) were A-OK and I'll probably use that same description to most Northern Dumplings I consume unless I have something that is really over doughy. 

This small Noodle based shop with good Mandarin-speaking service and fair pricing means I hope it will do well as this is the old spot of Kenzo and a few other restaurants prior to Yang's."}
{"text":"I really like coming here. It's always nice to see a restaurant, run by a family and to support the family businesses. In the past I've come and see a father/mother running the shop and perhaps their son and daughter helping out as well. It's good to support these businesses.

And it's even better when the food is good. I came here recently and I thought, well the food is good, what I'd expect from a corner dumpling place in Beijing. But then I ordered and ate and was reminded, wait a minute, this food is really good.

The menu is basically buns, dumplings, noodles and some snacks.
All the dumplings come either steamed or boiled with 15 dumplings. I ordered the Pork and Leek, nothing wrong with it. Tasted good and just kept on eating them.

Also ordered the Beijing Pancake, basically some pancake with a layer of pork/beef wrapped and folded. it's quite the art what they do, not only do they fold the pancake into multiple layers but also the meat is folded into multiple layers. You can actually see the folds of the meat! This one is worth eating.

The Noodles, I ordered the Beijing noodles. All noodles come with option of thick or thin noodles, but you won't really understand from the menu because it doesn't state that in English. But this one, had a bowl of noodles, and a place of julienne carrots, cucumbers and bean sprouts. It also has a smaller bowl of sauce with some meat in it. You mix all these together to have your bowl of noodles.
A tip on the menu, the first box is the thick noodles so I suppose the second box is the thin noodles.

They do a good job of making the menu in English, but there are clearly some points missing in translation and some of the restauranteurs are not the most fluent in English, no fault of their own but it makes things a bit more difficult."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night to expect awesome-tastic noodles.  Mainly from what I recalled from last year, it was ultra yummy.

Yang's is a Northern Chinese restaurant hidden in the plaza there.  I was introduced by a friend last year, and had not gone back for almost a year.  My craving for braised beef noodle soup brought me to Yang's.  I ordered the braised beef noodle soup with tendon and my friend ordered the braised beef noodle soup.  We also ordered a leek and pork fried bun.

The buns were okay - a little bit too much of the bread and not enough juice or meat inside.  The noodles were good too however I accidentaly ordered the thick handmade noodles.  It was a bit too thick for my liking.  Next time, I'm going to try the other type of noodles."}
{"text":"Yang's Restaurant is a little family runned Northern Chinese Restaurant  inside the New Kennedy Plaza.

Everything here is basic... with minimum decorations, minimum staffs (husband and Wife team). 

The menu has great selections of the usual Northern Chinese items: steam/fried buns, soup noodles and dumplings. 

The steam/fried buns are such a good value.. $5.99/steam, $6.99/fried and have 8 huge one! If I ate even half of that, I would not able to eat anything else. 

The dumplings are $5.99/15 of them. They are the perfect size for pop in your mouth eating. Pop Pop Pop and then you lose count how many you ate... The dumpling has less soup inside then some other dumplings places eating one of these babies would make you or your dinner mate all covered with soup.

The Esoteric Pork Noodle in Soup ($6.99), where Estoeric=house special. You can either have it in the hand pull noodle which is thicker and the other type is the thin one... hmmm the hand pull noodle is as thick as the Pappardelle. The soup base is like dark brown really thick .. flavoured by soy sauce and generous portion of mushroom. The soup based though look really salty but after my taste test is just look salty. The noodle here is quite chewy..has a good bite. But I think I would order some of the other 18 noodles they have on their menu instead.

No Lunch Special, but the price is reasonable enough. 

BTW, good place for you to practice your mandarin! 

They accepts Cash only!"}
