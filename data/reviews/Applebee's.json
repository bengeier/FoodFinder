{"text":"I guess I might be biased because I used to work at an Applebee's, but whatever - I still like the place.  But I can tell you for a fact that everything is NOT \"prepackaged and then warmed up.\" Nearly everything is made fresh, so don't act like you know this for a fact. I've watched the cooks prepare the food daily so many times, I could probably do it myself.  That being said, yea, it's not the greatest food in the world. It's definitely bar/grill food. Some of it is delicious, though - like the boneless wings and the oriental chicken salad. Other items are hit-or-miss, but what do you expect? This isn't a four-star establishment. They've cut down their lunch specials menu to just soup and salad, which sucks, but maybe they'll bring back the Pick 'n Pair someday.  This location is always good to go to if you want to relax, except for Fridays and Saturday nights. Also, Saturday night is karaoke, so go at your own risk. You'll probably have to suffer through tons of older folks singing bad country music.  Happy hour is pretty good here - 1/2 off drinks and select appetizers Monday through Friday, and drinks on Saturday and Sunday. Can't go wrong with that. They're totally dead late at night, so that's a great time to go.  I know this is a chain, but I like this location in particular because it isn't too busy and everyone is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Bad management in my opinion walk in the door the floors are filthy its multiple seats available but they said I had a 15 minute wait because they were low on staff. low on staff on a Friday come on. would not advise going here seem to be lazy and laxidasical. Based on my experience in life that would mean food is probably not going to be good for you and service poor. I left so.. to be fair I didn't actually try the food. good luck hope this helps"}
{"text":"The food is deacent for a chain grill pub.  Service is good. Price is fair. The portions could be larger.  Got maybe 12 fries with my sandwich"}
{"text":"I dislike this restaurant more than I like it. The one time we went there the food had way too much spices that it was way to salty. It tasted like microwave food. My kids ordered a hot chocolate and the hot chocolate was flowing out of the cup. There was not many people because we went on a Sunday but there was only 3 waitresses around and they all left us alone except when they were taking our order and serving our food."}
{"text":"This was the one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a chain restaurant in my life. I took some friends from out of town to Applebee's and it was a huge mistake. It looked like a good option driving by because the place was packed at 8:00pm so we decided to stop there. When we were seated we noticed the seating was extremely uncomfortable and the menu was extremely overwhelming. there were about 6-8 pages backed with multu-coloured writing and various fonts...It was almost headache indusing.  We ordered a garlic bread to start which took approx. 20 mins to arrive and was almost like a whole loaf of frozen bread soaked in some disgusting garlic concoction and covered in burned chunks of garlic and other various burned leftovers from the oven. Some friends also ordered french onion soup to start which looked absolutely disgusting and tasted the same.   When our meals arrived we were all disgusted with our food and between the four of us we tried a variety of menu options. Between us we tried Mini Pulled Pork Sliders, Beef Au Jus Sliders, Stir Fry and Steak and Potatoes. I can honestly say the one who got the short end of the stick was my friend that ordered teh Beef Sliders, the buns were brown, soggy and looked to possible be moldy. The only seeming bareable meal was the steak and potatoes which was complete with frozen veggies and approx. 8-10 teeny tiny potatoes that were burned and over seasoned. I wont even get into the other two menu items since I think by now it's obvious. I wouldn't recommend the Applebee's in Cambridge to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible place. We love Applebee's usually but when we went there last fall I received either a dirty skillet or they didn't clean the grill properly before slopping my food on there too. My chicken was close to texture and the flavor of fish, most of the vegetables were inedible. We didn't receive drink refills and our waitress spent most of her time talking up another table and ignoring us. When I made comments about my food that I didn't finish or barely even ate she seemed clueless and just started a conversation with my son instead of offering any help with fixing what was wrong with my dish. We left, unhappy, and I took the survey on my receipt that night. I received a call from management a day or two later to hear what all happened, apologized, and offered me gift cards to make up for our terrible evening. She said those would come in about a month.. that was over 6 months ago and still waiting. I guess I shouldn't have expected anything else from a place that was run so badly in the first place.. Lesson learned..."}
{"text":"When I first walked in there was no one to sit my friend and I. We just went to the bar and sat ourselves. Restaurant isn't brightly lit either, feels like I'm in a pub more than a restaurant.   The waitresses attended to us fairly quickly though, brought us water right away and took our orders quickly. Food also came quickly but seemed overpriced for what you get. I got a decent size plate of pasta and garlic bread for $14.99 while my friend got a handful of fries and a medium size burger for $11.99.   The waitresses did not bring any condiments with the burger, ask if we wanted re fills for our drinks, or check to see how our meals were.  Overall, 3/5... wouldn't come back by choice."}
{"text":"Not impressed hot shot whiskey chicken way over cooked dried out Server was nice but very slow and not very attentive  I have eaten at a lot better Applebee's and will not be back"}
{"text":"The won ton tacos are great, the orange spicy chicken was disgusting, the margarita shrimp was out of this world good. Decent service, sub-par food for the most part. Really greasy."}
{"text":"Usually have good experiences at Applebee's. Not today. Had the strawberry avocado salad and the greens were old and slimy. The toppings were fine but couldn't eat the lettuces. The servers and greeter were great."}
{"text":"This is not the best restaurant that I have been to the food was salty and the dessert was so big we couldn't eat it all and the food was done very sloppy. We came here on a Sunday night and there was nobody in the restaurant at all. We ordered 2 hot chocolates and somebody spilled it all. Then there was the soup. We ordered the french onion soup and it was horrible! I'm going to stop you there because the rest is the same. Way to much salt on some dishes and others were extremely bland."}
{"text":"NOTICE: This review is for Happy Hour ONLY! One day I was going to meet a friend half way between our offices. Applebees was the easiest place to find in the area, so we decided to roll the dice and meet there for a quick after work drink.  Their beer is 1/2 off during afterwork Happy Hour. So, if an American draft hits the spot for you and you want to spend around $2.50 on it, swing on by."}
{"text":"Ever want to see a hipster Applebee's?  I've only come by for lunch during the week, service is usually decent but time to get your food always seems to take a lot longer than it should.    They've also rolled out the new table side computers, I hate how distracting they are and how pushy servers are about using them. Honestly I dropped a star just for that and it will probably cause me to stop coming by as often as I do.  Food quality is what you expect, Sysco food with way too much sodium.  Saying that the chicken tortilla soup and honey pepper chicken tenders are pretty good.  Last thing is music, not that loud but everything they play is on a sliding scale from meh to truly aggravating.  Wow, after writing this I wonder why we go so much."}
{"text":"We went for latenight happy hour. It started at 9. Half price on select apps and alcohol. Andy was our bartender and he was fabulous! Very friendly and we look forward to coming back to his great service!"}
{"text":"Never Really crowded. Also enjoy the customer service, And the pretty waitresses. Too bad they don't have to tater skins. At least I have half off on Appetizers after 10 pm."}
{"text":"I have had very bad experiences here. Low quality of food and service over multiple visits have put Applebees on my black list. No more!"}
{"text":"Mostly empty on a Sunday Panthers afternoon?? Should've been first clue. Seated next to the only other table in restaurant, almost same time. The server took forever to do anything and combined our tables requests but didn't execute very well. My son ordered a kids sized shake - the other table got it and it was regular sized (I didn't see the bill so I don't know what we were charged). We ordered first - they got their food first. We asked for boxes and check first - other table served bills and boxes first. Mind you, every time he \"combined\" our requests he'd take care of the other table and disappear for a few minutes. The appetizer plates had food dried to it."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain because I use to be a server(11yrs). I have stopped coming into eat at the Bedford location due to poor sevice. So I have got carside togo twice this week. Wednesday sat in the car no one came out fine, after a few mins I just go in and the manager was aroundÂ  the corner and came rang me out and had the young lady grab my kids drink which took a couple of minutes, ok no big deal. So today(11/15/15) go to carside again, once again wouldn't you know it sat in the car a few minutes no one came out so go inside yet again, but this time sat there while 2 servers walked right by not saying a word another walked right by me on his way to the bathroom while texting or checking his fantasy team or whatever. Finally the hostess came all the way from the front door to see if she could help THANK GOD you have an asset to your struggling restaurant, she also checked with me before I had left thank you again for that. So anyways back to the problem at hand the same young lady from Wednesday finally comes out to help me, the order was not quite ready which was fine their had been another large order, but she didn't go over the order and I didn't notice that it had been short a kids milk, my wife's steak had no mushrooms or onions, they cooked it well done when it was ordered medium rare, so she has to go back up to the store to get her order corrected and her steak remade and they still couldn't cook it right. So the bottom line is that your Bedford location struggles as a wholeÂ  from the service inside, to the carside, to the execution of the kitchen staff. I only live 3 minutes tops from this location and would rather drive to another location then ever order from there again."}
{"text":"Get this - a group of cheap golfers deciding that two entrees for $20 was a great deal - and it would leave more $ for drinks.  And yes, that is the way it worked out.  Not having been in this Applebees before, we stopped on the way back from We-Ko-Pa.  After battling cacti for 5 hours, we were ready for food and cold drinks.  And we were not disappointed.  The food was great for the price - everyone was delighted with the quality and quantity of the food. The beer was cold, and the Wild Turkey was as good as ever.  More importantly, our waitress and the bartender were very patient.  As you all know, golfers, after a long day at play, can be very raucous and loud, and the staff was very friendly and tolerant.  This earned them an extra star.  When the guys come back down, I am sure they will want to come here again."}
{"text":"We have been several times. Dining in as well as curb side to go. Great service and good food. We always return."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Applebee's. The food was good for the money server Lauren was was good. good experience much improved over previous visits"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Won't be returning, after moving across the country me and my girlfriend thought we'd stop in to watch a game and get some dinner, little did we know that we'd get sat with Wesley who managed to neglect our drinks as we enjoyed our hot wing apps, couldn't keep up with his tables at all and had no customer appreciation or respect, a nice server from the otherside of the bar had to bring us our food and refills! Mean while the manager had stopped at every table around us to make small talk as well as be sure that all tables where enjoying there meals, we wanted to stay and watch the whole game but with disgust due to the disrespectful atmosphere we left and on our way out we left a note explaining our disappointing service to get chased down in the parking lot by the now overly aggressive manager who offered to buy us a round of drinks and begged us to come back in and give them another chance... If she would have comped our meals and handed us a gift card or better yet out money back then and maybe then would we think about returning, but realistically just returning to another location and \"friendly neighborhood grill\""}
{"text":"I think the last time we were at Applebee's was 6 years ago. We don't normally eat at any of the big US chains, but we were short on time, we wanted a quick bite to eat and we felt like a little Mexican food.  So we scooted over to this place and ordered the Sizzling Skillet Fajitas dinner to share. It was served sizzling, but it didn't have a lot of taste. They microwaved the soft tortillas so they were hot, but a little doughy.  We also ordered a side salad that was actually pretty big, but the lettuce was a little sad (wilted).  Overall our expectations weren't high coming in, and we wouldn't come back probably for another 6 years, but we were satisfied for the night."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and have sat at the bar both times as the bar tenders are very nice and keep up with you very well. The bar is large enough to eat at and the various tv's all are on different channels so there is plenty to watch. I have always been a fan of the food at Applebee's and here is no different. They also have my most fav craft beer on draft which is a big plus for me. We had a great time."}
{"text":"great casual place for lunch, great vegetarian burgers, I honestly see no flaws in this restaurant. and AMAZING service!! I think it's the best restaurant in the chain. great for families!! and VERY affordable!"}
{"text":"Not the best Applebee's experience that I've ever had. The individuals I dealt with were friendly, but the food was below what I have come to expect from Applebee's.  I called in an order for Car Side to Go, and when I asked if they needed a description of my vehicle, the reply was, \"no, that's ok, just come into the bar, I will help you there\". Ok, not the biggest inconvenience in the world, but what is the point of having car side to go, if they understaff and just lump it onto the bar tender's responsibilities?   As far as the food... Potato Twisters- Whoa, Seasoning! I usually love these, and I enjoy some spice, but these were loaded up to the point that they were not enjoyable.  Ultimate Trio  Pub Pretzel- the pretzels were fine, but the cheese sauce looked like it was literally scraped off the bottom after it had been left to simmer too long and lost any sign of moisture. I tried reheating it to no avail...the consistency remained a chunky, stringy mass.  Chicken Wonton- Good Sliders- Like nothing I have tasted before. No, really, I eat these all the time and something was just \"off\". I know they are supposed to have Applebee's signature burger sauce, but it just tasted like straight up BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Something's changed here....Disappointing!!!!   They took away the garlic steak.....too bad. Coffee served in plastic soda glasses......really?! Mushroom Swiss burger had ZERO mushrooms. Child's menu pizza was  below store brand frozen.  She refused to eat it after one taste.  Being pizza lovers, we thought we'd eat it....NO...first time in my life I've had to spit out pizza.  It was really bad. There's a digital screen on the tables. You can order or call your waitress - AND YOUR KIDS CAN ORDER GAMES AND HAVE THEM ADDED TO YOUR BILL...so, just be aware of that when they start to play with it."}
{"text":"I only go to Applebee's for the less than 550 calorie meals.  The asiago peppercorn steak dinner is my favorite."}
{"text":"Predictable meal with a bland but edible steak. I wasn't sure if they were open with all of the outside lights off. It's was a solid so-so meal."}
{"text":"What happened to Applebees?!?!?   They've lost their touch. The food just doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great staff, great food, no wait!  Happy Hour is great & love the perfect margaritas!"}
{"text":"Ghetto, dark, horrible service and need to close. I must say this though, they have good brownies, but I did find weave hair in my ice cream, that matched the weave of my server...."}
{"text":"Don't  waste your time. The place is located next to an abandoned shopping plaza. What does this tell you? Bad area with HIGH crime."}
{"text":"I've really grown to HATE Applebees...so why do I go?  Well, when I ride with my reps they get to choose lunch.  I hate Applebees because everything is prepackaged and then warmed up in each store.  BUT, the service is what gave this location a one star.    The server came and took our order (drink & food).  Then about 5 minutes later she came and told us our food was coming, but she had not brought our drinks...so we asked for our drinks.  Then food came, but i was missing a requested sauce by both of us.  She didn't come back to the table so my rep went to the counter and asked for sauce for both of us.  She brought his, not mine and then asked if I wanted sauce.  Then she asked if we needed more drink (they were both empty) and we said yes.  No, drinks until we asked again.  There are too many options to eat at Applebees."}
{"text":"Came in to order curbside togo, got the soup of the day and a full size salad. The soup was broccoli cheddar, when I received the cup, it was filled a little over halfway, $3.29 for literally 1c. size of room temperature thick soup where some of the cheese is not even melted. Also another disappointment was there was ok spoon provided in our bag, just forks. Not very helpful, and sadly I have no spoons at our house since we are currently in the process of moving. And to top it off, some of the lettuce in the salad I ordered was brown. I recommend skipping this one."}
{"text":"Applebee's is chain restaurant originating in the US that's made its way to Canada with some pretty decent success.  The menu is massive, overwhelmingly long even. After flipping through pages and pages of menu items we eventually conceded we wouldn't be able to give everything a fair look and settled on 'Sizzling Asian Shrimp' and Fajitas, both of which were pretty standard. I'd order them both again, or happily try something else.  As for service, it's a chain restaurant, I really don't need to say more than that. Same service you'd find at Kelsey's, East Sides, etc.  This place is family friendly to the max. We sat on their patio, but inside the restaurant was swarming with children.   They have a few options on their menu that they advertise as less than 550 calories but in general all of their portions are very modest. I'm not usually one to finish a restaurant meal but I easily polished this one off (which either means I was a glutton that day, or they do a good job of not giving you too much food).  Anyway, bring your kids. They'll love it!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? This review in no way is a reflection on our server Darrell. Beers on tap here are pretty nonexistent, our apps came 5 minutes before our entrees. These seem petty and they are, but are not the true problems with this restaurant. Chicken pasta arrives cold, my wife's had a hair in it that another waitress tried to say was hers when it was clearly embedded in the pasta. Darrell got it taken off the bill and we had requested to speak with the manager who managed to look at our table several times but never had the wherewithal to make it over to us. Poor management skills must be a given here. I suggest any other restaurant in town over this place."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Straight from a Sysco freezer truck to the deep fryer to our table.  Nothing fresh at all.  The waitress tried getting us out as fast as she could even though the place was empty on a Wednesday night at 6 pm. Had the lime aid and was not aware that refills were not free. Barely one star!!"}
{"text":"Visited Applebees for a family restaurant outing.  They have a good kids menu, and make an effort to make families feel welcome.  The restaurant has sports bar but it does not affect the family friendly atmosphere.    When we were there appetizers were half price for the elongated happy hour.  The meals came promptly, and were enjoyed by all.  The apple pie desert was exellent.    The only minor problemscame with the clearing of the table, which we had to ask for.  Also a wine glass was accidentally spilled, the server never offered to replace it, free or otherwise.  All in all a good place for after work sports bar action, and also for a family dinner."}
{"text":"wow! horrible service. I took my family there for lunch on a cloudy Saturday afternoon around 3pm on 6/8/14. we were the ONLY diners in the restaurant. server took our order, someone else dropped off mozz sticks and no one ever came back to give us silverware, napkins, plates. we coudn't find anyone working in the restaurant for about 5 minutes so we went behind the bar and got some bar napkins to use. then another server dropped off food and when we asked where our original guy went who had taken our order, they didn't know.  My avacado/chicken/stawberry salad was delicious, but there was barely any avacado or chicken. Basically it was a huge a bowl of lettuce with sliced strawberries. The food tasted good, horrible service, and we will never be back to that location."}
{"text":"For a national chain, this location is on par for what you can expect every where else. I really enjoyed the waitstaff, very attentive and proactive about refills etc. I had to review today because  ZOMG THE COWBOY BURGER.  It really is incredible. I have never been more satisfied from a burger in my life, I was full all night and all morning the next day. This burger was just *soo good*. It was definitely not what I was expecting.  Tip: go after 10 for 1/2 price apps, we had mozz sticks and quest Blanco dip, it was amazing. The blue ribbon brownie was sinfully good."}
{"text":"I used to love Applebees, I couldn't go wrong ordering a mucho mudslide and anything involving chicken and their magic honey sauce.  But it seems that chicken meal has disappeared from the menu, their mucho mudslide tastes more like ice than a milkshake, and their appetizers are all disappointing.  The only thing they still make that tastes good are their riblets."}
{"text":"3 of us came in for dinner at 10pm At 10:40, no food No waitress to be found Staff sitting at the bar I asked where my food was No answer One girl went to the kitchen, came back and never gave us an answer I finally asked for my check for our drinks She said there was no charge I asked the girl if she can think of any reason I would come back and she just she was sorry No reason was given This the a place run by amateurs and should be avoided"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful birthday here. They have a huge choices of food from Mexican, American to Italian. For 25 bucks, you can get an appetizer and 2 main dishes of your choice. Pretty good deal. Also, 10 bucks for unlimited snowball spaghetti. Overall, nice restaurant to eat, but it's too far from Toronto (1-hour drive)"}
{"text":"I usually like Applebee's but this particular one is the worst around, by far.  Drive to Avon or Rocky River.  Tried it for the first time in 2 years last night and had a terrible meal of the house sirloin.  The first one was way over cooked.  The next one was a bad cut of meat and didn't even have the regular marinated flavor.  The steamed vegetables were undercooked, cold and totally without any seasoning or flavor.  The mashed potatoes were awful.  Cold and runny with big lumps and totally tasteless.  How could they screw up such a basic popular entree?  No wonder it was nearly empty.  The server was actually pretty good but the food was awful."}
{"text":"What a sad excuse for a chain that touts its football games and specials on Sunday. I walk into this place about 1:30pm on Sunday and the hostess has no idea who is playing or what is TV. The bar has one person and one table filled. Meanwhile, there are football banners and pennants everywhere promoting the NFL, but they apparently don't carry the NFL package because only the nationally televised game was on their five TV's. Even the staff is wearing football jersey's - well there was a reason it was empty right smack in the middle of an NFL Sunday. What a pretender."}
{"text":"Just clean your utensils folks! I should have to feel like I need to bring my dishwashing liquid to be able to eat without catching someone's nasty germs. I literally dip utensils into a separate lemon water to clean off sketchy items!! Been here 3 times and each time there is some sort of problem. The last time, our server pulled a Houdini! If you saw her, we saw her! Smh... Haven't been back since!"}
{"text":"Zero Stars!!! This place used to be really good. I don't know what happen because now is absolutely horrible!!!  And the service is deplorable !!! My husband and I waited over 45 minutes for a drink our food actually arrived before our drinks. I had a sweet tea that was undrinkable it tasted like syrup, I had to ask for an unsweet just to mix it to make it drinkable. My husband had a margarita and when we finally got it to the table he realized it didn't have any salt on the rim!! Really people who serves a margarita without salt on the rim! And the mozzarella cheese sticks tasted like unflavored rubber.  I think it is safe to say that we will never return to the Gastonia Applebee's!"}
{"text":"It's Applebee's which gives you some expectations but not a lot. We came for a late dinner. Server was great which means a lot. I had a sort of healthy fish dish, low in calories. It wasn't great but was ok. My wife had ribs and was disappointed"}
{"text":"Speaking of the food - if you've been to one, you've been to all of them. It was ok. I am not a fan of Applebee's and there are so many great places in CLT, why go to a place I can go to anywhere? Anyway, we ended up here one night. The first thing I noticed was the dirty table we were sat next to. Not their fault, maybe some people just left. Over the next hour, though, I watched three or four people sit around and chat about three feet away. One guy kept messing with the rag in a bucket of water but never actually cleaned the table. Finally, our server, who was covering all the tables in our section, cleaned the table. I think his name was Chris and he looked to be the only person working."}
{"text":"First time dining at Applebee's and will never eat here again.  Menu was very pricey compared to its competitors.  I liked that the menu has an 'under 550 calories' page where you can select dishes that are calorie-wise.  I opted for a healthy grilled chicken and shrimps entree and quite enjoyed it although the portion was a bit minimal.  Understandable in trying to stay calorie-wise but I think they may have taken advantage of that a bit...  We were dissatisfied with the service as it appeared a bit pushy and inattentive.  Felt like she was trying to push appetizers and dessert on us although it makes sense...their policy is if the servers don't suggest an appetizer, you earn a free one.  Anyway, she seemed 'disappointed' that we didn't want anything besides our entrees.  Sorry but we are trying to be health-conscious.  Our water glasses were also not tended to at all and our appetizer plates were left behind, occupying a good amount of space on our tables.  Overall, a very pricey bill for a mediocre experience.  See ya Applebee's...so long!"}
{"text":"A trend in reviews and comments I have heard in the restaurant.....bad food.  I like Applebees as a chain, but I've decided to not go to this one any longer.  I've had a few meals here with friends and family.  Almost always a meal is sent back because things are under or over cooked or very bland.  Cold shrimp, soggy fried shrimp and stale items on salads are just a few reasons I won't go here again.  Also, my last visit we did not send anything back to the kitchen, but two tables around us did.  Just not up to the standards that Applebees should be expecting."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously slow and unapologetic about it. It is Gastonia, but still. Tried the carside-to-go, even worse. Gave it another shot, thinking maybe they were just having a bad night, and found that at least they're consistent. 50 minutes to get my small order to go last time. Oh, it was longer the first time. The signs outside for to-go orders should say, \"park here to be ignored \", or something along those lines. It is amusing to watch and listen to the customers leaving, but I was hungry dang it. Food isn't good enough to justify the wait and baditude. Don't think I'll ever give this place another try. Zero stars."}
{"text":"Good service and ambiance, polite servers. Food is good, especially the triple chocolate metldown. Nice little diner feel to it."}
{"text":"Applebees has become a family favorite. Excellent ribs, chicken. kids menu. Great family restaurant and service is great. Price is reasonable and we are having fun going through the new menu items."}
{"text":"My wife and I will never go back. We went last Saturday night about 7:00. The restaurant was about 60% full. Service was bad. Took about 1/2 hour to get silverware and napkin. We were told they had to roll some. We had to ask for tea refills and then was told they ran out of sweet tea and had to brew some, so we got Pepsi. Spinach Artichoke dip appetizer was cold, chips looked terrible. We asked and they brought another and was a little better. My steak was supposed to be medium well, but came medium rare to medium, and was cool along with the mashed potatoes and the broccoli. Sent back and was returned still about medium done and the sides were still cool. No apologies or any comment at all from the manager or wait staff. Very disappointing for an evening out."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour!!!  Half price drinks (except shots) and select appetizers.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Are these places Corporate owned or franchises?  I wonder?  Went for an early dinner with my wife last friday.  When we got there, we opened the door and waited at the hostess station for around five minutes before anyone came to greet us.  At the end of the bar, four wait staff were standing around and talking and not caring that they had customers waiting.  Then we were seated and waited a few more minutes before a male waiter came to take our drink order.  My wife ordered iced tea with no lemon and I ordered a beer on tap.  Her iced tea came rather quickly but it had a lemon wedge in it.  My beer did not come with her drink so I waited and waited.  About seven minutes later the waiter said that he could not find the bartender so he could not get me a beer --- WTF?  What kind of stupid place is this?  So after about 10 minutes we got our iced tea without lemon and my beer.    We ordered the two for $20 dinners they were pretty good.  Not outstanding, but pretty good.  We ordered the onion rings for our appetizer and they came hot, crispy, and perfectly fried -- I liked those.  My wife ordered the riblets with french fries and those were good too.  I ordered the four cheese penne with chicken and that came as a big serving and was pretty good too.  So I think the food is decent, not great, but decent, and the male waiter was a good server.  But the overall customer service focus and the way management runs that establishment needs to pay attention.  My guess is that this place is losing money and it is no wonder why this is happening.  I could be wrong, but these are my opinions and observations."}
{"text":"Zero stars worst Applebee's ever I love Applebee's came here for my birthday but the food was bad got me sick the waitress was nice but the lady in front sucked this place is horrible. Avoid it trust me and I'm being honest"}
{"text":"It has been years, if not a decade, since I went to an Applebee's.  Last time the food, the service, everything was just awful..  I went out of sheer hunger and proximity, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was great, and fast.  The food was hot and tasty.  We ended up just having a bunch of appetizers (who doesn't love an appetizer dinner, you know), and everything was great.  The pretzel sticks were terrific and the wings were done just the way I like.  Not over done and just saucy enough.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Worse service ever. My husband and I went in on a Friday night. Service was slow not that busy we just were lucky enough to get laziest of them. 20.00 special...appetizer was decent spinach dip... My husband got the sirloin med rare..initially it came out Med to Med well. We hate to be complainers but come on..took awile for manager to come out and \"inspect\" our complaint...she of course agreed..meanwhile I'm sitting with my food and I hate eating when somebody else isn't eating or has their food delivered, but I digress the 2nd steak came out still over cooked. Hungry by now we just accepted in stride and he ate it. Way salty. Check cones to table FINALLY! Seriously we never saw her. Was sooooo frustrating. Its like what are you doing. Ugh! Check was 20.00 off. We had to wait and wait, wait, wait, wait till finally my husband approached our waitress while she congregated up front with Co workers. She fixes the mistake and by now we want to leave..we were ready to go, but we wait and wait, wait, wait, till I finally grab another more ummmmm astute waiter who took our bill. I hate, hate under tipping having worked in the industry in my youth, but I had no choice. In the short will never ever never visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Went back to Applebee's after a very long time. Think it's been years! They have an excellent priced new menu. Last night I ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken and my friend ordered a Prolonged Cheese stuffed Meatballs with Fettuccine. And we got the Spinach Dip appetizer with Nachos. All that for $25!! And for this special there are other choices. You pick 2 entrees and one appetizer. Let me tell you... the chicken tastes sooo juicy and good!! You can get a double portion of chicken for only $3 more! They have an all you can eat Rib-Let or All you can eat Prolonged Cheese stuffed Meatballs with Fettuccine for $10! Are the prices amazing or what? There are many many more deals. I can't remember them all lol. And the food is grrrrreat!!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hampton Inn next door. I called and ordered delivery on a salad and a drink.   They were prompt and friendly . The chicken was steaming hot and the salad was prepared exactly how I wanted it.  they came right to my door within 15 min with the food."}
{"text":"We went  there for happy hour on a friday afternoon, ordered four half price appetizers. Very pleased we the portion size and the quality. Certainly a great value along with the Sam Adams brews.  The only problem is we were both extremely thirsty for the rest of the night, even though the food did not taste salty."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to go here. Me never having been to an applebee's said yes. Cause you know maybe they have great food and that's why they're everywhere, so I should at least try it!  Well it was pretty much what I would have expected. The service was super friendly, I was there earlier than my friend so I thought I'd have to wait at the front for a table, but the hostess cheerfully told me no worries and gave me a table and that she'd direct my friend there when he arrived!  We decided to do the 2 for $20 which I thought was a nice idea more restaurants should do this! Started with the honey barbeque boneless wings. My company seemed to enjoy them, though personally I thought there was way too much sauce on them and ended up chewing through all the celery sticks that came with them after trying out two of them. I went with the Cajun shrimp pasta for my entree, while my friend opted for the chicken strips basket with fries. The entrees came out pretty fast and hot which was nice. My pasta was okay, a bit too creamy making me wish I had some acid to cut through the richness. I wouldn't mind eating here occasionally but I wouldn't come back too often."}
{"text":"changed the lighting, not able to even see the menu let alone the food! the service is good still. we hardly come back now at night because of the lighting situation. other applebees arent this dark."}
{"text":"Went for lunch  closed   All signs are off the building no notice. What happened?   Pfft gone!"}
{"text":"We decided to grab Applebee's To-Go today. My wife needed me to take the child out of the house for a little while, so I opted not to pre-order online like I've done in the past. I figured that would make for some good quiet time for the wife, and some daddy/daughter time for the little one and myself.  We pulled up to the To-Go parking, and almost immediately, Jamie was out the door to greet us. Granted, she thought we were another customer, though the reception was certainly welcome. When she realized that we weren't who she was expecting, she escorted us inside to let us place our order.  Having a family of three, we tend to order from the 2 for $20 menu. That way, we get a good appetizer and two entrees for, you guessed it, $20. Today, my wife and I opted for an entree we'd never ordered before, the \"Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp\", with a side of broccoli, and Spinach and Artichoke dip for the appetizer. The little one went for her old standby, the grilled cheese sandwich with applesauce.  These entrees were really good!  The chicken was served over a bed of sauteed onions, and topped with about half-a-dozen shrimp, each one coated in a nice cajun seasoning. The shrimp were delicious, and the chicken was AMAZING! I know, it might sound a bit ridiculous to rant about chicken...but it was that good. The cut was exceptionally thick, and it was cooked just right...still juicy and delicious!  Now, it wasn't ALL smiles. The only gripe I have is with the broccoli. I'm not sure if they were in a hurry to get it out the door, but whoever was steaming it stopped about half-way through. It was palatable, it just wasn't as delicious as it could have been.  I'm not 100% sure how the grilled cheese was...all I know is that I looked one minute and it was there, and the next minute it was gone. So, I'm assuming it was pretty decent.  After the dust settled, and we got the bill, the three of us got great meals for $25. Not bad at all.  If you're in a hurry, or you have little ones who may or may not act like complete animals from time to time, ordering online and picking up your meal To-Go is a lifesaver!"}
{"text":"It's an Applebee's..but who doesn't love Applebees?! I needed and L.I.T. bad one day after having to deal with apartment issues. They have flavored L.I.T.'s there and they were half price after 9pm. It was an amazing ( and much needed) deal. The flavor I got was strawberry and I would recommend it- it's a very strong yet, refreshing drink! We got the 2 for $24 deal and everything was amazing. We both got the ribs and got the mozzarella sticks to share. At that point I was so hungry I ate everything in front of me. The server was very nice and the atmosphere was quiet since it was after 9pm.  I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I must say, Applebee's has really stepped up their game lately! I've been to 2 of their locations in the past few months and haven't been disappointed at all. Their HH is awesome and they have re-vamped their menu. The drink menu is also really good. I specifically enjoy the white peach sangria and you can't go wrong with a $3 20 oz beer on draft. I literally live around the corner from this location and have visited several times (carside to go included). The customer service is quite wonderful; everyone is very friendly and helpful. The carside to go is super convenient and fast so if you're in a hurry or don't want to eat inside, get it to go. The 2 for $20 is also a nice option (but limited) if you're wanting to eat out for less. Overall, 5 stars to Applebee's and this location especially!"}
{"text":"Food= Yuck.  Service= Not stellar what so ever  Only thing i do love here is their happy hours Half off drinks!!!  L O V E   I T!!!  If i were to go out for a girls night or something i would come here before going anywhere honestly...Only other fun place for happy hours is Devils Advocate Thursday Nights or BJS& Kona Tuesday Nights!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Sunday evening for dinner.   We say there two for $20 special and decided to give it a try. You split an appetizer and then order an entry from a limited menu.  We had the spinach artichoke dip and it was hot gooey and real tasty.  My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad and I ordered the top sirloin.  My wife said the salad was good and the sreving was huge.  My stake was average and the vegetables were over cooked.  it was a good meal for the $20 and I will likely do this again but I will go in knowing that you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I like this Applebee's because it's right across from Crocker, and if I'm with friends from college, it's a nice cheap place to go where I know I'll get some good food. I mean 2 for $20, us BW students loveee that.   I've never had a bad experience here, and I like that it's right on Detroit Rd. very convenient!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here for the first time in years. The service was good and so was the food. We enjoyed the new lunch combos. We are looking forward to trying them all. We will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Yeah I live in Gastonia. It's quiet and it's cheap and I'm from Texas, so I don't mind commuting to Charlotte. But my job now requires me to work nights and there are few places to eat in Gastonia after midnight.   Which is how I found myself at Applebee's.   So, any restaurant in Gastonia gets extra weird on the weekend, when the yokels 'come to town' for a night out. Believe me, you will see some characters.   Let me preface, this isn't a review for Applebee's. This is a review for Friday night at Applebee's.   The food is just as shitty. But the entertainment is top notch.  Sleeveless hillbillies, Dungeon and Dragon players and all manor of douche bags complain about slow service, sing along to Katy Perry on PA system and gorge themselves on all you can eat fries.  I really must remember to get something to eat before crossing Charlotte city limits."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Applebee's in years, but I patroned this particular location because I happened to have a couple of gift cards to use. The restaurant was clean and there was a lot of natural lighting coming through the windows unlike the Chilis restaurant across the street. That particular aspect stood out to me because I'd hate to hang out somewhere that's dark and depressing. More importantly, unlike Chillis, I was greeted by welcoming employees.   My companion and I came on a Saturday afternoon..around 2:00pm so we probably missed the busy lunchtime crowd and there was a sparse crowd. We ordred from the under 550 calories menu. I'm not a calorie counter, but eating healthy is very important to me. I selected the Signature Sirloin with Garlic Herb Shrimp, which I absolutely loved. It was full of flavor and light. I would say it was enough for a meal, but I had cravings to eat more that day so ended up chowing down on some desert after leaving Applebees. My companion that day also had a dish from the under 550 calorie menu of which I don't remember exactly which it was, but I remember tasting a little and it was equally tasty and light. Every selection on that menu appeared appetizing and worth trying on another day."}
{"text":"Good people but absolutely horrid food. The 4 cheese Mac and cheese had no cheese and was inedible. Any out of the box mac & cheese would have been a 100 times better. The tomato soup and spinach dip were likewise inedible. The soup was like marinara sauce. I feel sorry for the people working there."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I come here often because we live across the street and it is our anniversary spot! Has been for the last 3 years. We love this particular location and its bartenders are awesome! He made me my first sangria and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I highly recommend their burgers over everything else! Love love love you guys!!"}
{"text":"Now, since I live directly across the street, considering this was not my first time here - I thought it would be another memorable eat out...UH NOT! Me and my friend went in about 9:30. We were hungry, it was Friday night and we wanted to get toasted and eat. Now my server was ok, not bad. SHE was more than accommodating and helped us order our food.  I started out with a nice Rasp Margarita w. Absolut...WHEW! That was perfect, how can you mess that up! My friend ordered a \"sweet\" tea...I wondered why he wasn't drinking it. I then helped him order a strawberry Martini.  Next up, we did the $12.99 app trio to set things off: Boneless wings, tacos and cheese sticks. Again not bad, but the boneless chicken was fried brick hard, but because I was getting toasted off of that Margarita I ate it. He loved the stix and tacos.  Now when it came  to ordering the main course, that's where things started going down hill.... To add insult to injury, asking people for extra napkins should never be hard, but I recall asking for them like 3 times from 3 different people who clearly were coherent when they acknowledged my request and said: \"Ok, sure\". But never delivered the goods.   When I finished my drink, I also ordered a \"sweet\" tea, while we were making our dinner selections. I chose the 4 cheese mac and he wanted the fish and chips plate.  Now keep in mind, it really wasn't packed in the place, since it's friday night, around 10. I would say only about 5-6 tables are being used in total, and the guys @ the bar chilling out, drinking and ordering their apps... doing their thing.  Now by this time my server had gone back into the back and when the food came out, another guy delivered it - like ok. He was cool, but not very attentive, like other restaurants. Never asked is there anything else I can get you...NOTHING!  I'M SITTING HERE WITH MY PLATE IN FRONT OF ME, no extra Napkins, nothing to drink and it's not even a packed house. PISS POOR QUALITY.  So by this time, another girl (who was pregnant by the way) had came around and noticed my face. She took the time out of what she was doing (making her money, waiting her table) to ask if there was something needed. so I asked again for a \"sweet\" tea. She went along and got it. Now - I get why my friend wasn't drinking his sweet tea. I wasn't \"sweet\" tea @ all, just something that was brown and was just water...lmao! Not even unsweetened tea. I complained about that. She said there was a guy making it. So, by this time my server had come around, and I told her about it, and she delivered another cup, which yielded the same results.  She said this guy who  is in charge of making the tea  felt he should make it the way he likes it and that's that! NO IT ISN'T! I WANT SWEET TEA! We all shared a laugh, and she said she would go in the back and make another batch herself.    She also said that there are sugar packs to use on the table, but clearly this \"tea\" wasn't in need of sugar packs, it was BROWN water. I'm not paying to drink sugar water.  When SHE came back, I drank,  I was all smiles. NOW THAT'S A SWEET TEA! Why do they have men making things they clearly know nothing about. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN?  Now on to the food - LOL. Clearly an inexperienced male chef made it. Now the pasta had some kind of weird taste to it and my friend hated his fish, as it was fried to brick status. I tasted it and it was all hard on the outside and mushy on the inside. LMAO! Shit was cray! Clearly this place needs to get the men out of the kitchen and get the women in the kitchen! In all with tip, I wasted $61.00, which the meal clearly wasn't worth the 54, I was charged.  We went to Red Lobster on Independence last weekend and received top notch A+++ class service. Food was excellent and prepared by knowledgeable chefs. It was a great experience! This one wasn't so. Buy the ladies were all nice and accommodating. I just love female hosts. The men @ this location are not very accommodating."}
{"text":"Normally like this place, but was very disappointed tonight. We had 9 people, and they ran out of fries, so they split what they had left between 5 of our people - said they would bring more but never did. Then ordered hot fudge shooters - they were a joke! They contained 1/4 teaspoon of hot fudge tops. Restaurant needs attention Applebee's!"}
{"text":"Saturday at 6:00 pm. About half way filled. Not surprising because there's so many events going on uptown.  Shannon took our app, drink, and meal orders without writing anything down.  Shannon came right over to get out drink orders. Minutes later retuned with our drinks from the bar. So far so good. Within 10 minutes of arriving we had drinks and btw the won tong tacos were pretty awesome. After 20 minutes our food arrived hot and smelling awesome.  The daily brunch burger and fries was an awesome burger. The fried were seasoned perfectly. Overall a solid experience."}
{"text":"Came to this Applebee's last week and really enjoyed our experience. We went when it was slow, about 3 pm. Enjoyed the happy hour- great prices! We sat at the bar and the bartender was REALLY great! He had reddish orangish hair and really understood customer service. He checked up on us accordingly and really knew his stuff when we asked him various questions. He was also very patient with us when we didn't know what we wanted to order :) I also enjoyed that the employees were wearing jerseys for the football season. Very spirited while we watched the games on TV.  The only thing that stunk was that he was \"breaking\" the bartender so when it was time for us to pay, he didn't keep our tip..the female bartender did. But I guess there's nothing we can do about that :) Next time we're in the mood for great happy hour we know just where to go!"}
{"text":"Holy Shrimp - I'm not sure if it's becuase Mardi Gras or because we're coming up to Lent, but there were 6 \"new\" shrimp options on the menu.  I didn't eat any of them, & this place was really no different than any other Applebees (except that someone opened the door upon arrival & closed it behind us).  They also had a nice touch to the \"shamrock MD purchase\" in that they advertised help for 1 specific boy & had pictures of him on the wall."}
{"text":"Pretty good menu, great service and good decor... I actually said decor, what the hell man? Food was really good, steak was cooked exactly as requested and everyone enjoyed the meal.  Wouldn't go out of my way, but if in the area it deserves a return."}
{"text":"Service was quick, food was quick & hot, and the drinks kept coming. Yay for Snobsdale!"}
{"text":"Me and the family decided to give Applebee's Neighbourhood Grill and Bar in Mississauga a try.  We had some great experiences with Applebee's in the States and we thought it would be just as good..I was wrong..  The food was the culprit this time, the staff and the location was excellent.  The decor seemed a little dated, tons of oak or oak like features everywhere.  Luckily we sat on the patio (party of 8 people).  We ordered a variety of items from the 2 for $25-$30-$35 menu.  I ordered the Chicken or steak won-tons and the Cajun Shrimp pasta from the $30 dollar menu.  I have to digress, the chicken won-tons were actually very good, so if you have to order an appetizer.  I suggest you get that one, very tasty.  On the other hand the Cajun Shrimp pasta tasted like a pasta in a milk sauce with a sprinkling of shrimp (around 5-6 pcs).  It was very bland and it had no flavor that I was expecting.  The other entrees and appetizers were just like some normal pub fare..frozen chicken fingers, frozen and deep fried shrimp and average steak.  As I raved about before..the chicken or steak won-tons are excellent!  Our experiences were not like those in the States and the food expectations were not met, but the people and service were good, the location had ample parking, but the restaurant definitely needs a style overhaul. If your looking to get a pint after work and want some easy eats this is a place for you."}
{"text":"They just redid their happy hour... its ALL DAY DRINK SPECIALS NOW. 3 bucks for a tall boy of the diesel. Sign me up! Food is always good, didnt have any the last time I was there tho."}
{"text":"Exemplary service! Due to health restrictions, we had specific instructions on our food. Both the manager & Kris went above the call of duty to ensure this was met.  The food was fresh, bountiful, & tasted great!  We did not wait for a thing!  I travel and go to many types of restaurants, from top chef owned private restaurants to off the beaten path.  This Applebee's was refreshingly nice! It was quiet, cheery, accommodating, quick, w a great staff!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch with my 3 young kids, my cousin, my dad, my husband. Party of 7. The adults all got the all-u-can-eat soup and salad lunch. The kids got kids meals. It took exactly 40 minutes for us to get our plates. Kids are cranky at this point from the long wait.  If you've never had the all-u-can-eat deal, it's basically a pinch of salad and 2 slurps of soup; i.e. the SMALLEST possible serving ever. Soup is cold, salad is drowning in dressing.The fun part begins now that we are STILL starving... wait 10 minutes after eating our meal to track down a waitress to request a \"refill\" serving. 30 minutes later... we get our second serving - still, tiniest ever portion. Hunger is still not satisfied as the portion is so minimal - BUT the kids have now been sitting there for well over 1.5 hours and we just need to get the hell out. The very pregnant manager finally appears to open the door for us to leave - I VERY kindly tell her that the service was extremely slow and the all-u-can-eat deal seems like a scam if you can't get much to eat... and that when you have children, this kind of service is really sad. She says sorry but thanks for coming. Well, NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"This Applebee's went out of Business December 2013.  Was a great location and good food and Staff."}
{"text":"When you have the munchies and everywhere else is closed this is the hot spot. Outside of that I probably wouldn't come to Applebee's. It's not bad by any means but it's not a choice I consider until desperation sets it. The nachos are on point for sure. They aren't as good as the nachos of 2005 but they are still pretty good. The people here are always friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"I regret to inform the yelp crowd that Applebee's on Crocker rd in WESTLAKE ohio has closed!"}
{"text":"Literally heard the bartender and an employee talking about how this place is haunted!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived February 11th at 6:00 and despite a moderate crowd, we had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  Not a big deal at first but turned out to be a good indication of what was to come:  server took awhile to get drink orders, and every step of the process was abysmal!  Waiter seemed to be totally inexperienced!  :(   soup finally came out cold but my wife had to walk it back because waiter never came to check on how it was!   And we had to ask where soup was cause it was supposed to come before the dinner.   Even getting the check was a hassle.  My wife had to find the waitervto get our bill!   The experience almost ruined the night for taking so long and ended up at McDonalds for coffee and dessert instead of here.   Food was otherwise not too bad.  Tomato basil soup, on 2nd try, was at least a full bowl (1st was maybe half full in small bowls) but tasty.  I had 550 cal sizzling chili chicken, (very small) side order of rice and beans which was at leasr cheap and wife had low cal chichen dish which she said was ok other than not liking how broccoli was cooked (too much of the garlic seasoning).  All in all: $50 was grossly too much to pay for the food and even moreso for horrendous service.   It took over an hour, maybe hour & 15 minutes!   STAY AWAY at least for dinner.   My wife works in Solon and has enjoyed quick lunch service at this location."}
{"text":"My mom and sister drove here from L.A. to visit me and I decided to take them to Applebees to treat them with an evening appetizer. This was at around 9:30pm about three weeks or so ago. We parked, we entered, we stood there for two or three minutes, we didn't even get a second glance from an employee, we walked out, we drove away, and we went to Chili's. That Chili's experience was well worth the Applebees exit!! Delicious!  I give Applebees one extra star because I ate at this particular Applebees twice before, and it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten in here 2-3 times and did \"Carside to go\" twice.  No matter how I've eaten here - it has always been a solid experience.  The carside to go deal is awesome.  They see your car pull in and bring it right out.  The staff on the phone is friendly when they take your order, the staff in person has always been very accommodating and they don't do the \"eye roll\" when I ask for a booth.  I just moved to this side of the valley from the west side and, let me tell you, if you think anything negative about this Applebee's - try to eat at one on the west side (yech).  Favorites:  The new wedge salad, the pretzels with beer cheese, and the potato twisters.  (I am a real health nut.)  Also, if you haven't tried a Perfect with extra olives, you're missing out."}
{"text":"My Mother, husband, and I stopped here while traveling to Tennessee. I almost decided on another spot, due to the reviews, but we where on a time schedule and stopped to get a quick bite. All of us ordered the steak and shrimp combo. The food was great!!! The waiter, Anthony, was even better and very polite (and cute). The food service was prompt. Everything turned out very nice!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Applebee's I've been to in a long time. The service was good and the food was made properly. I usually order the same things so I can tell when the cooks are slacking; they certainly didn't at this place!"}
{"text":"Great food & Great Service! I come with my youth group almost every Tuesday and we usually come at 10 or later so we get to take advantage of the half-price appetizers (a great deal btw!) The waitresses are always very helpful, very kind and courteous. The food may be over seasoned/sauced sometimes but I think that should be expected for the middle of the night in Applebee's! But overall I love coming here."}
{"text":"Applebee's is really not my first choice for food but it was late and it was on the way home so we stopped by to pick up some food to go.   The customer service is great! Everyone greeted us Upon entering. The bartender who places out order was honest, attentive and funny. Different staff members gave us their opinions on he menu. There was an overall good vibe at Applebee's like the employees actually get along and like their job.    In terms of food I would say it was averse chain food nothing tasted horrible but nothing was absolutely delicious. I had the Cajun pasta and also then seasoning wasn't bad I found the pasta a bit on the dry side. Not sure if they use a Cajun seasoning base and toss it with pasta, olive oil and tomatoes? I thought the pasta could benefit from some tomato or Alfredo sauce. My boyfriend had the grilled chicken, breaded shrimp with green beens and roasted potatoes. It was ok, the shrimp was tossed in a sauce that was a bit to sweet for me but the green beans were seasoned well and not overcooked.   Overall Applebee's is a last resort for me but I really like the staff. They had a cool drink menu. Maybe it would be low key place to come and have a few drinks at the bar with a friend and talk."}
{"text":"Applebee's is one of those restaurants where you hear the name often but don't really pay much attention to. Went here on a whim because neither of us had tried it ever. They seemed a bit understaffed as our server was also the bartender and she was running back and forth from the bar to various tables. Nothing really wowed me on the menu so I opted for soup, salad and garlic toast trio. Choice of any of their soups and salads. Food came out pretty quick. Tasting wise, it was okay but I also didn't order anything fancy either.    It's an average place. Nothing wowed me but it wasn't terrible either. I do like that they have a calorie wise menu for all the health conscious eaters."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time about 2 and half weeks ago and omg.. I actually like it! I had a steak and it honestly was really good! I would come here again."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of a major intersection, this place ain't to bad considering the neighborhood.  I used to live in Bedford, so this place is pleasantly clean and neat with a very friendly staff.  Decent parking in a private lot.  The food is pretty good as well.  I'm not a regular here, but I've never had an issue any of the times I have been here.  I've never seen the place crowded or overly busy, so getting a seat right away is very likely."}
{"text":"This restaurant along with other applebees aren't anything special.  It's more of a family resturant with ok prices for pub food.  They have a 2 for $25 deal where you can choose 1 appetizer from a list and 1 entree from a list.  I got the mozzarella sticks  and the 7oz steak.  The service did take a while, but at least the waitress was friendly.  The sticks were good, but the steak was just regular nothing special.  I had tried a friends chicken entree which was a bit dry.  The place does get busy and the tables are so close to each other that you can hear everyone's conversation around you.  I would not go back here."}
{"text":"I have to say this location is overall decent. Good was hot, service great. Location is close to highway."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the steak I had last night was really good. It came out much better than I expected. The bartender was very polite and nice. Had a good experience."}
