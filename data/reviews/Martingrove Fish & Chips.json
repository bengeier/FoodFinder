{"text":"Martingrove Fish & Chips is the absolute best fish & chip joint in Toronto.
It's well worth the trek out to central Etobicoke.
Light and cripy fish and fries for under 10 bux. 
My mouth is watering as I write this. ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips; the location is hidden down a residential street and they only take cash, but if you want a flavorful order of fish and chips, this is the place to get it. There's usually a crowd of people eating in the restaurant too, so I usually take it to go."}
{"text":"Simply put, simply delicious food.  Lacks quite a bit in the ambiance department, but I went back to the counter for more fish because I wanted to try both options.  In town for work and was dressed in my suit... When I first saw the joint I thought I'd look for something a little \"nicer\" but after seeing a bunch of the same old chains or pizza/sub shops, I went back and was glad I did! Very pleasant service as well!"}
{"text":"The halibut was great! Light, slightly crispy, flaky and not oily! Great with the malt vinegar! Nothing fancy, just good food and worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I had the halibut lunch special and I thought it was very good. The fish was nicely cooked and not greasy. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I decided to take a picture of their hours because I've made two attempts to come here and both times they were closed. Third times a charm!!! 

The halibut and chips were very good. The service was better than I expected. This place was definitely busy which goes to show how yummy it is. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing fish and chips - wrapped in paper a la old school. Generous portions and always fresh. Cash only!"}
{"text":"I've been to 5 Lavington many times to pick up pizzas or chicken from Ital in the same strip mall so I finally decided we'd go for lunch at Martingrove Fish and Chips on a weekend.  I normally wouldn't get to make it here for dinner on a regular evening so the weekend works out best I suppose.

My wife and I both ordered the same thing which was a lunch special (one of 3).  Lunch specials are from 11am to 2pm and the one we ended up choosing was the halibut and chips, cole slaw and a drink for 11.50, after tax it comes out to about 13 bucks.

I have to say I was really happy with this lunch.  The halibut was a nice size and the fries were really good.  Nothing was greasy at all which is exactly what you want when you're ordering an entire fried meal.  

It wasn't busy when we arrived in fact we were the only eat in patrons.  During our lunch several people came in to get take out.  Tarter sauce was in packets, malt and white vinegar as well as ketchup was at the table.  

The portion size and the quality for the money is a good deal for a nice sit down lunch.  The halibut was cooked well and not overly heavy on the batter and both the fries and fish were not greasy which is what I was hoping for.

While there was other items like shrimp and haddock on the menu I'm surprised there wasn't any cod.  I would have loved to have tried that too.

Still a good place in a relatively unknown area."}
{"text":"Avoid this place school days 11:30-12:30. Bombarded by noisy teenagers from the local high school making it very unpleasant to eat . Difficult to even leAve because of the crowds of kids. Even takeout is difficult at these times.
Otherwise, I like the fish. Onion rings leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Lunch.  Haddock and chips.  Wow.  Well cooked and tasty.  Fries and fish batter has the perfect crunch. Excellent service. Reminiscent of the 70's.  Lovely."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place.  I'm getting used to Etobicoke.  To me, the location is a bit odd, because it's in a little plaza located smack dab in the middle of a residential zone, however everyone else seems pretty unfazed by this.  It's some serious fish and chips.  Note that they post lunch special pricing, but if you are ordering outside of lunch time, those same specials are a few dollars more...so that's a bit misleading.  Pretty tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is about as no nonsense as a fish & chips place gets.
very simple menu, no frills or attempts to make things gourmet, just good old fish and chips like you'd get in small-town north Ontario!
The halibut I ordered was super tasty. The batter was only slightly crispy and not too oily, while the filet was extra flaky and tart. Disappointingly the tartar sauce comes in little plastic packets but I totally forgot to add any as the only thing this fish needed was a bit of lemon juice. Large cut fries were also tasty and nothing more or less than you'd expect.
This is a nice hidden gem of a lunch spot if you happen to be in the hood!"}
{"text":"Location: 3/5 only locals know this place

Will be back."}
