{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner last night. I had the salmon with lobster/bacon risotto and my husband had the center cut filet with bleu cheese and mashed potatoes. We ended by sharing an amazing chocolate pecan pie. Our friends shared the cheesecake which was \"to die for\" and 4 inches high!! They took home more than half. The atmosphere was classy but not stuffy, unique and very comfortable. Looking forward to visiting again soon! Best night out in a long time."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, my husband and I decided to give the new Webb Custom Kitchen a try for dinner this evening, and what a wonderful decision.  First, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  You feel that you have stepped into another world.  Second, you are met with friendly, welcoming staff.  After taking in the beauty of your surroundings, you then begin to eat, drink and enjoy.  We started with the Angry Lobster Appetizer (delectable); then I had a rack of baby back ribs (do yourself a favor and order the two racks) with the mashed potatoes (all so indescribably delicious there is no way to put it into words, but trust me....delicious).  My husband had the spiced tuna dish, and again, it is hard to put into words just how yummy the flavors are in this scrumptious dish.  There is no need to drive to Charlotte in search of outstanding food and ambiance, it is now in our little town of Gastonia."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times were fantastic. The service was spot on and I believe the bartenders name was Andy makes a mean drink. The steak was cooked perfectly and the crab cakes are phenomenal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It is wonderful for Gastonia to hold a hidden gem, which is the Webb Custom Kitchen.  My wife and I have dined there over a dozen times & every time was EXCELLENT.   Cozy atmosphere paired with great food make for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"This is the best food you can find in Gastonia. Fillet was excellent as was everything else. Even the bread was amazing. The atmosphere is worth it alone with the old movies playing on the screen above the kitchen. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our anniversary. I wanted to do something special. I was blown away. I had read the reviews, so I was expecting something good, but my expectations were far exceeded. I had the Carolina trout, stuffed with crab meat, on top of fried green tomatoes, with roasted vegetable melody. It was light, tender and delicious. My wife had the baby back ribs which were fall of the bone tender with that smoky sweet flavor. She's not a heavy eater, but all that was left were the bones of a full rack. Then we shared the coconut cake, OMG, three tall layers of moist, flaky heaven on a plate. Our server, Misty, was prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable. We were made to feel very comfortable and at ease. We were given a card for our anniversary that everyone had signed and written us a personal note in. It was an unexpected personal touch from such a busy place. I will definitely give up most of my other usual restaurants, just to be able to go here more often than on an anniversary. It's our new favorite.."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! Took my team here for a celebration dinner and was not disappointed. The restaurant is beautiful, elegant and sophisticated. I have recommended the restaurant to everyone I have come in contact with since. The upstairs is so romantic with corner booths and ambiance galore. Can not say enough about this place. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday, march 29 we brought my father to dine at your restaurant for his 77th birthday. Everything, from the wait staff to the food was impeccable. Twice management came to our table to make sure things were as expected. This is our third time and it only seems to get better. Again, cannot stress how great our waitress was."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  5 stars on all counts. They did this right!  Atmosphere was very nice, and we sat in the balcony seating, which was very unique. We looked over the kitchen and had a good view of the movie screen which the place used to be a movie theater, so the history behind the building makes it even more special. The Food was delicious, and the meals were very reasonable compared to the amount of food they served. I got the crab stuffed Trout and it was 2 filets of trout with crab stuffing in between. Creamy spinach was spot on as well!  Great wine selection and our server, DeeDee, was amazing, friendly, and took very good care of us. Managers came over to converse with customers and made us feel very welcome and wanted to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. Monday is half off bottles of Wine...yay!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My group of three, had a very positive experience here the wait staff was excellent and attentive to our needs by keeping out glasses full and the food came out in an orderly manner. We had the duck cigars as an appetizer then the NY Strip the Atlantic Salmon and one of the daily specials as our main course. All the meals were cooked as ordered then we tried the NY Cheese Cake for desert. That's one huge piece of Cheese Cake, I would highly recommend trying the restaurant out. I'm looking forward to trying out some of other menu items on my next visit as there will be another visit."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of experiencing Webb Custom Kitchen on opening night & was blown away. It is breathtaking, to say the least. The historic feel combined with modern deco lead you into an amazing dining experience. The wait staff was very attentive & made sure we all had a great time. The food....gorgeous presentation & everything we tried was very tasty. They are not kidding when they say \"generous pour\" of wine. My glass was FULL I can't wait to spread the word & I foresee many evenings of delicious fun with friends & family here!
Oh & did I mention complimentary valet???  Yep...they know how to take care of that too!"}
{"text":"Awesome night out with wife and friends. Came here for restaurant week. Our servers name was Kara and she was a real treat. Understood craft brews and assisted us with samples as we were unsure based upon there names. The selections for restaurant week were we'll rounded. I had the 12 oz prime rib and there was no issues with it. Ordered medium well and I can say it was tender, tasty and moist. The horseradish sauce was great. It didn't overpower the flavor of the prime rib but added to it. My wife had the filet mignon and she wanted it med well also. Due to the request Kara made a suggestion to fillet so it would be done the way my wife wanted. That decision was spot on. Now, for desert one in our party ordered the Bread Pudding. Turns out this was special for restaurant week. I want to suggest that you order that as it is not on the menu any other time. I hope that they would consider adding that as a regular choice !!  Go for the food but enjoy the ambiance, comradeship, and hospitality. The silent movies playing on the screen just added to our experience. You won't be disappointed if you come."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great find!  Our family just moved to the area and we were looking for a nice place to eat. We saw the great reviews so we thought we'd check it out for ourselves. Even the \"picky\" eater in the family was pleased. We started with Cheesy Bread and the Duck Cigar. They were both delicious in different ways. Cheesy Bread was a creamy and cheesy mass of goodness atop crunchy breads. The Duck Cigar was a very long spring roll filled with a yummy duck mixture cut into 4 pieces. It was served with 3 different sauces to select from. Our entrees included the Ribeye, Crab Cakes, Prime Rib and BeefTenderloin Medallions Danish Style. All were very well prepared to our liking and served with our choice of sides. We enjoyed the grilled vegetables, the loaded Yukon mashed potatoes and the Truffle fries. Again - they were prepared well and the ample serving was more than we could eat. Yes - we had leftovers and I'm looking forward to having them tomorrow!"}
{"text":"My 90 yr old mother and I first ate at Webb on an exploratory relocation trip to Charlotte.  I grew up in the Sonoma and Napa valleys where excellent food and wine are part of the daily culture.  Webb is as wonderful as any of the meals I used to have.  The ambiance is beautiful, the waitstaff so well-trained and friendly.  The food is SUPERB!  I thought it was a good omen to find such a terrific place and 2 mos later we returned.  This time we were warmly welcomed by the manager and I know that Webb will become a regular part of our life, as we settle into becoming North Carolinians.  Thank you in advance for all the great meals in our future Webb Kitchen."}
{"text":"Yum!  This would be my choice for a date night or special event, even though it is a 35 minute drive from the Speedway/North University area of Charlotte where I live.  We were there for a family birthday party.  Parking for lunch at 11 a.m. was easy with a free lot a block away and empty spaces out front. 

Charlotte has nothing like it.  Truly memorable.

The beautifully-renovated old movie theater sets the scene with three levels of dining and a private dining room for parties.  The top level is intimate and romantic, with its views of the constantly-playing vintage movies.  The lowest floor is large and airy with a view of the open kitchen, authentic movie memorabilia, and the large bar.  

Portions are huge, prices are very reasonable for what you get, and their gourmet sandwiches were really excellent.  Everything was very fresh and service was excellent.  They even make the desserts themselves from scratch at their Mooresville location )(one of three) and send them over fresh.  Don't miss the totally decadent cheesy bread and the crab cake sandwich.

These people know how to run a restaurant!  I really cannot think of anything to criticize."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant to have in Gastonia! Original restaurants are few and far between here and Charlotte.  We are so excited about the location, the food and the service!  Our first visit last night will hopefully be the first of many.  The bartender, Andy, is great front man, very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly.  We so hope that the restaurant succeeds and we will do our best to be regulars!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Yes, it may be a little bit pricey but it makes up for it with the quantity and quality of the food being so much better than others. The wait staff is great, it's easy to make reservations, and it's such a calming, relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious food.  Hoping to make a return visit.  Driving just an hour to find a great restaurant was a treat."}
{"text":"Webb Custom Kitchen definitely deserves this 5 star rating. The service was excellent and the drinks are delicious. The food was outstanding. Lobster appetizer, crab stuffed cod and prime rib, all wonderful."}
{"text":"Gastonia was long overdue for a finer dining establishment.  Webb Custom Kitchen now fills that void with it's character and charm while preserving the history of what use to be a movie theater.  The menu features a variety of dishes to please everyone's appetite.  I had the wedge salad and duck and it was out of this world.  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Super impressed and hope to be able to come back. We happened upon Custom Webb Kitchen due to their strong Yelp rating and well... it exceeded our expectations.

The service (Josh) was great, the cocktails (Charlotte's Webb) were tasty, the dishes (Spiced Rare Tuna) delicious, and yes we even managed to save room for a darn good dessert (Pineapple Upside Down Cake). 

Note 1: the wasabi drizzle on the Spiced Rare Tuna is strong. Like super strong.

Note 2: the Pineapple Upside Down Cake has a layer of cheesecake... as in delicious cheesecake... enough said.

Solid service and good food make for a great experience... but let's talk about the restaurant itself. Wow. It is an old theatre that has been completely redesigned into a rad dining experience. We found out after our meal, but after taking a peek at the upstairs balcony, I'd suggest requesting balcony seating for your visit. 

Overall, the experience was great."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is awesome. Took me a long time to finally get around to heading this deep into gastonia but so worth it. Duck fried rice worth eating here alone. So good, so so good."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Like several of the other reviewers stated, not just 'good for Gastonia' it's truly good. Cool atmosphere--in an old movie theater and they have old movies from the silver screen playing while you eat. Just a really cool place to go."}
{"text":"My husband took me for a fantastic birthday dinner at Webb's Custom Kitchen in Gastonia, a former movie theater. Atmosphere was truly special, service top notch and sincerely friendly, food was out of this world. High recommendations for this place."}
{"text":"First time at Webb Custom Kitchen, and we absolutely loved it! For appetizer we had the angry lobster which was flash fried lobster with a dipping sauce, it was delicious. I had the crab cakes and vegetable medley, I have never tasted anything so amazing. I would highly recommend anyone to this restaurant and if you make reservation request balcony seating it's a unique experience."}
{"text":"I don't know if I can add anything of value to all of the other positive reviews, but if I can say something that will help someone else have a pleasant experience I'll certainly try.  First off, we got there fairly early, 6:15-ish, on a Friday evening without reservations and didn't have to wait at all. When we left 2 hrs later the lobby was packed out. Food for thought.  

DeeDee, our server, was very knowledgeable of the menu and very pleasant. She was also quite well-versed in the history of the building and what was done in the remodeling process. Since it's an old theatre there are old movies from Turner Classic Movies playing on the big screen. Nice touch.

So, we ordered the Duck Cigars as an appetizer and they were pretty good.  Basically an eggroll filled with cabbage and duck meat with 3 dipping sauces. Next,  the entree's.  My wife ordered the Salmon and I got the Braised Short Rib.  First, the Salmon.  It was perfectly cooked with a nice crust on top.  Slightly under-salted, but very flavorful nonetheless. It came on a bed of lobster risotto that was amazing.  Coulda finished off a bowl of that by itself.  As good as the Salmon was, my Short Rib was in another league altogether. Super tender, melt-in-your-mouth goodness smothered in a rich, decadent sauce.  What made this dish was the bed of celeriac at the bottom. I've never had celeriac before (DeeDee explained it was celery root, I didn't even know celery stalks grew on large roots)  but I can tell you the chef here makes it heavenly.  Tastes kinda like celery...only really good. Give me a bowl of this stuff and a bowl of the lobster risotto and I'm set!  The Short Rib also came with a side of ginger-glazed carrots.  Great flavor, but way under cooked for my liking; they were actually crunchy.  But since the entree was SO good I won't deduct anything for the carrots.  Oh yeah, I also ordered a side salad with my meal. I tried the Citrus Cumin dressing and was pleasantly surprised.  At first all I tasted was cumin, but then the citrus really punches through for a nice balance. Very interesting flavor combination.

And by now we were both quite full, but couldn't pass up the Cheesecake we had seen on another table, so we shared one slice.  A very big slice of classic New York style yumminess. Great texture, not too heavy, not too sweet.  

If there's one negative with my experience it's that I like to try new dishes. So next time I visit if I try something new and it doesn't measure up to that amazing Short Rib I'm gonna be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great find in Gastonia! The food was excellent (actual health food type offerings)presented beautifully in a lovely contemporary setting.  The waiters are well versed in the menu items and are friendly and attentive. A bit pricer than other restaurants in the area but you get what you pay for and its worth every penny."}
{"text":"Beautiful resturant in gastonia. The food is great and the staff is awesome! They have free valet parking which is not usual for gastonia, but is nice. My husband had the fish and I had the duck. Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the pork belly for an appetizer and it was to die for! We literally debated on which one of us was going to eat the last piece, Lol. We would definitely go back to West Custom Kitchen."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic and the food is phenomenal!  The bar tenders are attentive and friendly and the owners are there ensuring things are running smoothly. So nice to have a non-chain place that is doing fantastic in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Generous pours of wine & very attentive service! I really hope this restaurant makes it in Gastonia! My food was fresh & good...I will be back!"}
{"text":"We finally made it out to try the Webb Custom Kitchen and were not disappointed. 
I had the Parkerhouse Seared Salmon. The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium and had a crunchy herbed breading, very nice. However, the star of the dish has to be the corn and lobster risotto. Oh my god, that risotto is delicious. I could have eaten a bowl of it and been happy. I always thought the lobster mac'n' cheese at the Capital Grille was my favorite use of lobster in a side, but this has just replaced it.  Sometimes people make lobster dishes sickly rich or smother the sweetness of the meat with butter and cream. Not here, the corn complimented it, and the risotto with ham supported it without overwhelming. 
My wife had the crab stuffed trout and loved it. This is a dish we have enjoyed at the owner's other restaurant, Chillfire (another place for a great meal). So for our first visit we were two-for-two with delicious meals."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight!  Absolutely delicious.  Atmosphere great, service great.  Best restaurant in the area!  My wife and will make this a regular stop for our special evenings out."}
{"text":"I took my friends there to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and it was a special evening.  Service was right on. Drinks were well presented and varied.  But the food was the star.  I just took the special of the day since I couldn't make up my mind.  I would rate this place with any I have been to.  Thanks for making the evening special."}
{"text":"Excellent filet and wonderful service.  Would have given five stars except it was too bright for evening dining.  Felt more like lunchtime.  A little ambience would be nice."}
{"text":"The only negative to this great place is location.  Other than that this place is outstanding! The venue is incredible, who knew you could turn an old theater into a restaurant. The bar is a good spot to wait for your table. We were lucky enough to get a table upstairs and it was an awesome view. It was cool to see the kitchen and the non stop tmc old time movies. The food...top notch. We had Dee Dee as our server and she was very attentive and you could tell she really liked her job. I would recommend this place to everyone I see."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had! We visited on 2/14/18, and EVERYTHING was exactly on point! The food was beyond delicious, Rob (our server) was gracious, friendly, and expert, and the ambiance was phenomenal! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! We will definitely be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Webb Custom Kitchen is a hidden gem! The atmosphere, food, and pricing combine to make this a worthwhile trip from anywhere in the Charlotte region. Bottles of wine are reasonably priced, and they have a good selection to choose from. Overall this restaurant will be a staple in our routine."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Gastonia! Try to dine here at least once, you'll be glad you did. All the positive reviews are absolutely true. It's an amazing place to have a nice dinner. I was absolutely impressed and pleasantly surprised with the food preparation, staff and atmosphere. The manager made a point to welcome us and ask if he could get us anything. He was very friendly and personable. This establishment has got it going on. Everyone working there was very professional and friendly . I highly recommend the Upside-down Pineapple Cheesecake, it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is awesome, it used to be a movie theater. The service was great and the atmosphere was great but the food was only so-so."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I love the ambiance (I'd recommend sitting on one of the uppr levels).

The food is reasonably priced and very good.  The wait staff is knowledgable and service is good.  I've been there at least 3 times and the food has always been great

They have a new fine wine menu, although I didn't indulge."}
{"text":"Last night myself and my family had the wonderful experience of celebrating a birthday at WCK in their private dining room. It was truly exceptional. The food was fantastic (as always) and the service outstanding (thanks Dee Dee you are awesome). I can't express enough thanks that such a great restaurant is finally available to us in Gastonia. 

If you have to special event I strongly encourage that you consider WCK for a truly memorable night out. What a great team of folks that truly make each guest feel like family.

Jim, Jon, Aaron, you guys are doing it right. Keep up the fantastic work. Thank you so much and please pass along my sincere appreciation to the rest of your team. See you soon."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place!  I took my wife there for her birthday this past Thursday evening, and she was unduly impressed with the food, service and unique atmosphere. We relocated to the area about two years ago from the metropolitan area of Indianapolis Indiana, where fine restaurants are abundant. The Webb Custom Kitchen rivals any 5 star restaurant we've been accustomed to!  Local food sourcing, including the blue crab and gras fed Angus beef is commendable, vs. the typical chain, 5 star restaurants. I highly recommend this restaurant!

To the owners of Web custom kitchen, I did not write another review, it was another Mark B! Anyway, thanks for the reply and I appreciate the wonderful evening my wife and I had at your establishment!"}
{"text":"The menu offered a nice variety.  Four out of six of our meals were excellent.  Two chicken entrees were overcooked, sent back to the kitchen, quickly redone and delivered to our table. Second time around the chicken was cooked correctly.  Our server was a very nice young man who answered our questions and tended to our table in a professional manner. Refurbishing an old movie theater into a restaurant is a great concept and the decor was appealing."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Our waiter Zack was extremely helpful in assisting my husband and I in the selection of our entrees. He was not only knowledgeable about the menu items but was friendly and engaging in general. I ordered the crab cakes with the risotto which was delicious. My husband had the pork chops and duck confit fried rice. He ordered it medium and it came out well, but the manager promptly apologized, had another made for him and treated us to two complimentary desserts   (the BlackBerry cheesecake and pineapple upside-down cheesecake which both were fantastic). My husband loved his meal as well. The portion sizes appeared small when I viewed the pics online but in person they're more than adequate and we both were unable to finish our meals/desserts and had then boxed up for later. Both of the managers, a man and a woman (sorry I forgot their names) made sure to visit every table and check on all of the customers. The restaurant is beautiful and unique in its layout. I love that it has multiple levels and an open kitchen. It's in Gastonia so to be honest I was surprised at how nice it is but it's a testament to the efforts made to build up and redevelop the community of Gastonia. I didn't mean to write such a lengthy review but it's quite a gem and so I hope people will take the opportunity to visit. They offer valet parking and reservations are recommended but not required."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Was listed by Forbes Magazine and Opentable as one of the top 100 Romantic Restaurants in America. Everything exceeded my expectations. Will become the go to restaurant when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have dinner probably in the whole Charlotte market. The atmosphere is great. We usually make reservations and get a table in the balcony. I love that the kitchen is directly below the movie screen. If you haven't been the pictures don't do it justice. It's a really unique place. 

The food is top notch. I'd recommend the duck cigars as a starter and the cowboy steak is amazing. 

Service is impressive and the wait staff are always personable and knowledgeable. 

The only thing I'd change, and it's a small gripe, if that they play Turner Classic Movies on the screen during dinner. I wish they would just play classic movies. The movie TCM is playing is usually what is on the screen but when the movie is over and it's commercials or a behind the scenes show, it takes away from the atmosphere of the place. 

Love this place, its my favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food in a cool atmosphere. Kids steak was actually filet medallions. Cheesecake was homemade and huge."}
{"text":"We don't live in the area, just stopped on Gastonia for the night. The hotel recommended Webb's for a nice meal. We loved it. The food was outstanding. I had chicken with gran parada and roasted veggies. My husband got the chicken with tomato basil and goat cheese on the recommendation of our server. Both were excellent. Portions are large. Wine pours are generous, especially for the price. Service was attentive. She made good recommendations for wine pairings with our meal. We will definitely come back if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Not sure they understand the concept of reservations.  Got there 10 minutes before the reservation time to be told it is a 25 to 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"This is place is the cats meow! I highly recommend the braised pork belly to start with a glass of Charles Krug Merlot. If you are looking to eat something more on the lighter side, the kale salad is to die for. For the main course I had the center cut filet, which was cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, the presentation and Aesthetics of this restaurant are on point. The high ceilings and stepping table arrangement is very cool. Furthermore, the plating of the food and table decor is very well done. That being said, the rest of the restaurant was not as great.

Now the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't as great as I'd hoped. Everything I ordered was heavily salted. The service was quite slow and lackluster. None of the items ordered had an flair or originality to them. Quite frankly, food-wise, this place offered no more than Outback Steakhouse, which isn't a terrible thing, I just had higher expectations."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with out experience after reading all the rave reviews. Service was good. Our soups were great. I sent the drink I ordered back as it was not as described. I had a filet... I ate half. I ordered it medium rare and it was a tough medium. The outside was burnt. My side, potato cakes were, good. My boyfriend ordered the NY strip. It was cooked right. The flavor was okay. The grits were good. The only that either of is ate that I would recommend is the lobster cappuccino soup. The feel of restaurant was nice."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time. Ate at the bat because they were so busy. My wife and I did the appetizer, salad, meal, and dessert at the bar and the gentleman working the bar, (didn't catch his name) was very nice and really knowledgeable about the menu. 3 bartenders working kept up with the crowded bar despite how busy they were. Struck a conversation with other diners. The food was great (I ordered the ribeye, she got the filet) the cheesy grits are awesome. The atmosphere and other patrons were great... Shout out to Steve and Rugby! WCK became my favorite restaurant in Gastonia in one night!"}
{"text":"Last week I had the pleasure of dining at Webb Custom Kitchen. My family was celebrating my mother-in-law's birthday and we couldn't have been more pleased. We requested a quiet table when we placed our reservation and had the perfect spot upstairs. Our servers Jordan and Megan were excellent. Timing of food was perfect. Apps and entrees were absolutely delicious. We shared a few desserts and each were divine, especially the NY cheesecake.  5 star experience across the board."}
{"text":"Slow service but has potential. My husband and I ate here a few weeks after the opening. The restaurant was full and the servers were really busy. We waited about 10 minutes for our drinks and another 20-30 minutes for our food. Our salads never arrived and were taken off our bill. We received no refills on our drinks as the server didn't reappear until the manager ask how the meal was. The food was great so we will return and hope for more seamless service."}
{"text":"Had a couples dinner with our neighbors at Webb Custom Kitchen last night and let me tell you I was very surprised. After the horrible service we all received from Nick's which was the last restaurant at this location. We didn't think we would receive such excellent service as we did last night. This place had been gutted and totally redone. The atmosphere was wonderful. The staff was so engaging and the Manager Zane or James (can't remember) was a delight to talk with. Our glasses was never empty. The waitress, DeeDee with the dreads was on point with every detail of our meal. She knew the menu front and back. She has tasted everything on it and she was proud to declare it. She got so happy talking about the food, I had to tell her to calm down lol! My husband had the glazed bbq baby back ribs which he said was fabulous, I had the Parma Grana Crusted Breast of Chicken It was succulent, however it was somewhat on the bland side. Do not pass up the Kale salad or Box Office House Salad they are addictive! My neighbors had the Pork Lion Chop and the Basil and Garlic Breast of Chicken with goat cheese salad. The Pork Lion wasn't bad, but the sauce was not favorable. The basil chicken was really moist and tasty however he didn't like the goat cheese salad. Three of us had the country potato cake side and boy was it delicious. The Mash potatoes side was favorable as well. We will definitely have to return very soon to the \"Webb.\" Thanks for the great hospitality."}
{"text":"So decided to come here on a weekday, no reservation but we were seated immediately. I had been dreaming about the duck cigars before going but when we ordered we were told they might be out :( so I picked something else instead. Got the lobster tails which are always delicious and decide to try the grilled artichokes. The artichokes didn't taste grilled though, and there were barely any grill marks. They tasted more like canned/bottled ones. Wasn't that crazy about them although I usually love them.
Then I wanted to have the ribeye and had been salivating about it before getting there and after ordering the manager came over to tell us that they were out :( He offered to substitute it with the Kansas strip which he said was 10 dollars more but will give it to us for the same price as the ribeye. Said it was pretty good. 
So we went for it and got the celeriac puree as a side. The steak was tender and moist but just was NOT a ribeye. I love the fat and awesome marbling on ribeye's. The celeriac puree was ok, I guess I had high expectations for it since I had some awesome puree a weeks ago in Washington DC. If it was pureed more and seasoned it would've been much better. 
I'm going to have to go back to get the cigars and ribeye but I'll call ahead to make sure because otherwise I'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the absolute best restaurants i have been too. The service was top notch, the food was beyond what i  expected. Simply the best experience I have had in a long time. The manager Zane was attentive, funny, and gave us a historical tour of the restaurant. Meridith, our server, was phenomenal. The decor was perfect for any occasion from happy hour, girls night, date night, celebrating, business meeting, or simply going out to dinner!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give 3.5 stars. 3 stars seems unfair but they didn't quite earn 4 stars. 

Due to the overwhelming positive and glowing Yelp reviews I chose to travel from Charlotte to this restaurant for my birthday dinner with my sister and brother in law. My sister made reservations for 7:30. We arrived at 7:29 and was told the kitchen was backed up and we would be seated in 15 - 20 minutes. We took a seat at their beautiful bar.  25 minutes later a gentleman, who I assume was a manager, came by to apologize for our small wait time (25 minutes is small???) but they were waiting for guests to leave...seems like the reason for the wait changed.  We were finally shown to our seats 32 minutes after our reservation time. Now, those seats were basically in the kitchen...seriously; every server and busboy passed our table, we could hear the kitchen chatter, the smoke caused me to cough repeatedly.  Now, every other guest we saw seated were escorted to the balcony where the movie screen feature can be seen...the real reason I wanted to come to the restaurant...but no, we get the view of staff expediting food and smoke filled lungs, hair and clothes. 

I am a bit of a foodie and travel for business. I have eaten in many fine dining establisments here in the US and internationally. I have participated in chef's table tastings/dinner. This was not like that all.

For complete transparency,  I must say they did offer to move us to another table a few feet away. I didnt think it would have been much better and we had settled in. So, we chose not to move. However; I would have expected more concern from management or even the offer of complimentary appetizer or dessert. 

The good:  Our server (DeeDee) was knowledgeable and very friendly and professional.  The food ranged from meh (grilled chicken wings) to very good - not mind blowing (grits, fried lobster, stuffed trout, burger). Portions were generous.

I was so looking forward to the unique and nostalgic experience of dining in a renovated movie theater while viewing whatever classic film was playing.  What I got was decent food and an unsexy view of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get to Webb Custom Kitchen for the longest time! I'm finally in Charlotte on an extended break, so Webb was at the top of my list of places to try. It's in downtown Gastonia, but once you step inside you feel like you've been transported back in time. The restaurant is in a renovated movie theater, and the owners have kept much of the original theater house design. They play old black and white TMC movies on the wall, and the soundtrack is playing softly in the background. Amazing ambience. The server was really polite and had good suggestions. I ordered the crabcake sandwich and zucchini fries. The fries and dipping sauce were delicious. They didn't taste frozen or from a bag- super fresh and a perfectly seasoned and crisp breading. The crabcake sandwich was also really good- I wasn't a huge fan of the bread on the sandwich, but there was plenty of crabmeat and little to no filler. Prices were really reasonable, most entrees were $12-16. I'll definitely go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"The decor was amazing! The ambiance is great and the food was very very good.  Pork Belly was AMAZING, star of the show. Only downside is appetizer only came with 1 piece. We had the prime rib and rack of ribs. The prime rib could use a touch more seasoning but it was tender and cooked really well. The rack of was great as well, could use more sauce but good non the less. The bbq sauce was not really tangy or sweet. Could use more variety in the sauces. We went for date night, would recommend for dates, family, and etc. Everything is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Entrees ranges $15-30."}
{"text":"Had the prime rib and it was good. Great decor and atmosphere. Cheesecake is unbelievable"}
{"text":"I wanted so incredibly bad to like this place.  Took my wife on a date and found WCK on OpenTable.  The menu looked great, awesome craft cocktails and a super cool interior that is crafted from an old movie theater and plays clips of old movies.  It reminded me a lot of a place in San Francisco that my wife and I went to.  

We got to the place and really loved the atmosphere.  We grabbed a drink at the bar which was really good and then were seated.  The atmosphere was really cool (maybe could have been a little less bright, but that's getting picky).  Our waitress was really nice and went over the menu.  We ordered another round of drinks and some appetizers.  We ordered a \"flash fried\" lobster appetizer and duck confit cigars.  The lobster was overly fried and the duck cigars just tasted like an egg roll.  Not super impressed but also not the worst.
 
We looked over the menu and it all looked so good.  We couldn't decide on an entree, the list of sides looked amazing and we wanted dessert so we decided to get three sides: lobster corn risotto, brussel sprouts, and glazed mushrooms.  Each one was worse than the next.

The brussel sprouts were least terrible but were mushy almost like they were boiled or steamed.  No flavor at all to them (this is a theme).  Next, the lobster corn risotto was hard and devoid of any flavor at all.  Super disappointing.  Then the mushrooms.  Wow.  If someone took canned mushrooms and dumped them in a pool of garbage water it would be better.  They were remarkably bad.  

We decided to skip dessert at that point at went to Amelie's.  So the review here is: 4.5 star atmosphere, 4 stars for drinks and service and negative five stars for food.  Which makes us so sad because when we came in we talked about how many people we wanted to tell about this place but now I would keep all of my frends away until they fix the food."}
{"text":"Webb Custom Kitchen was great! We started at the bar with drinks and their cocktails are amazing! Then we all got the kings feast menu. The cheesy bread is to die for. The steak was cooked perfectly. Crab cake was decent but I'm from Maryland so I am picky. The pineapple upside down cake cheesecake was amazing!! I also tried the fried lobster appetizer and the wedge salad as well as shrimp cocktail. Nothing to complain about. The environment is cool in an old theatre. Service was excellent! I will go back"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  Finally a spot away from Charlotte that knows how to get the job done.  3 people, a few cocktails and dinner $100 Bucks?  You kidding me right .  Would have been $200 in Charlotte.  The classic old theater will have you staring at the ceiling as well as the food.  Going back Sat night!  Oh.... And no BS parking fees or traffic to deal with!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with probably the best customer service I've experienced at a restaurant. Ordered the cheese bread for my appetizer and it was really good. My dining companion had the lobster for his appetizer and he enjoyed it. For the main course I chose the Parmesan encrusted chicken with potato cakes and cheddar grits as a side. While the chicken was cooked perfectly I didn't like the flavors so I sent it back and got the beef short rib which was good. The potato cakes were also good, but the cheddar grits were bland and needed salt. Overall the food was pretty good but the customer service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Fantastic food some great bartenders. Probably the best in the area. I was travelling on business and heard about this place from locals. The filet medallions did not disappoint the blue cheese topping was complimented nicely by a good local IPA on tap (I tried a number of restaurants around town and most didn't have a decent IPA so this was a definite plus. ) a little on the expensive side but certainly worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful dinner experience. The food was exceptional. Duck Cigars were very good. Soup of the day was chicken and dumplings - best soup I've ever had! Parmesan crusted chicken breast was my entree and was exceptional as well.

Webb also features an exhaustive wine list along with about 5 local craft beers on tap. Would definitely recommend for a classier dinner!"}
{"text":"Tonight we tried Webb Custom Kitchen (completing the trifecta, Chill Fire in Denver, Epic in Mooresville, and Webb.). Webb was the best of the group.  The atmosphere is great.  There is an old movie playing at all times.  If you have a group you can reserve your own room on the second floor.  The third floor offers intimate seating with great views of the movie.
The building is sprinkled with many pieces that display its history as a theater.
The wait staff was especially friendly and provided great service.  The waiter and Manager spent time with us telling us about the menu, the building and its history.
My wife had the Spice Rubbed  Teres Major, I had rack of ribs.  We shared the pineapple upside doe cake.  The food was great and the service was just as great.  
I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch en route to Charlotte. What an incredible experience! The restaurant is in an old theater, and has been beautifully restored. 
We started with an order of the cheesy bread. It was a delicious blend of 4 cheeses melted over brioche. 
For my entree, I ordered the braised short rib over mashed potatoes. The meat was tender and pulled apart with little effort. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. 
To top everything off, I had the blackberry cheesecake. It was rich and decadent. 
Our server, Sarah, was amazing and took great care of us. 
I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"ENJOYED OUR PRIVATE ROOM! My Grandpa's birthday was the best this weekend. The food was AMAZING and you get stuffed because you get a lot! Def get an order of the Angry Lobster, and desert. Had to take my steak back but they didn't mind replacing it for a more rare steak. The first one was a bit too over cooked to my liking but I can't stop dreaming about their prime rib! My boyfriend ordered the Queens it was AMAZING! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ryan was amazing! Food was delicious. Had the angry lobster... Then ordered a second because it was so tasty. 

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Although we had to wait a while. We sat at the bar and grabbed a few drinks which were delicious. After we sat down we had an excellent 2nd story view of the old school movie theater. We ordered the bone in Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly to medium. The sides were excellent. Ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert, it was rich but split between 2 people was very nice. Our waiter Derrick was prompt and very nice. We would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Webb Custom Kitchen made our anniversary such an amazing experience. Each person we met was so genuine and kind. Our server was Lindsay and she was absolutely amazing! The food was top notch. Try the duck cigars for an appetizer! We'd definitely take the 45 minute drive again!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Gastonia. Great ambience, good food, very good service by our Server DeeDee...Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere. Clean and inviting- service could use some help, but we were overall satisfied."}
{"text":"I came to Gastonia for the science museum and decided to try here for lunch based on the Yelp reviews. The restaurant is an old theater and they have capped a lot of the original details in the building. I like that it had a theme but was not tacky. The service was excellent. Our waiter and management checked on us throughout our meal. We tried the duck cigar for an appetizer and it was very tasty. I had the Ocean's Eleven sandwich and zucchini fries. The seafood salad was really good. It was full of seafood and a great flavor of fresh dill. The bread was also really good. I enjoyed the zucchini fries. If you are looking for some great options they definitely offer them with their lunch sandwiches. The kids meal was great. We ordered our son shrimp and roasted vegetables. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the vegetables were well roasted and tasty. My husband enjoyed his crab cake and mac and cheese. Desert sounded delicious but we had to hit the road. Next time I am in Gastonia I will definitely eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  It's a really great asset to our Gastonia restaurant community.  Looking forward to my next visit.  Love the Teres Major but may try some of the other wonderful items.  WCK is the place to go in Gtown."}
{"text":"Happy The Webb Custom Kitchen has opened in Gastonia. Food and service is excellent. Nice ambiance. Try the upstairs dining in the balcony. Meredith was our server she did a great job. Very nice, attentive. She took good care of us. I highly recommend The Webb."}
{"text":"HALLELUJAH! SOMETHING DELICIOUS IS FINALLY IN THIS ABSOLUTELY AMAAAAAAZING SPACE!!!!!!!

Webb Custom Kitchen is absolutely wonderful in absolutely all aspects--ambiance, food, bar, and service! The restaurant is located in Gastonia's Webb Theater which opened in the 1920s as a movie theater (and has now been STUNNINGLY restored! Seriously, y'all. This space is gorgeous!) The open kitchen is located just below a gigantic movie screen showing old movies circa the days when the theater was in operation as such. The food and drink menu is extensive and is consistently executed flawlessly. This is one of the few restaurants where the dish exceeds the expectations set by the menu! The drink menu boasts unique and delicous combinations and the food has tried and true classics as well as more specialized options.The wait staff is always knowledgable, prompt, and friendly.

Webb Custom Kitchen is the type of restaurant that is absolutely perfect for date-nights or something just a little bit special. It's also wonderful for groups with both wide open seating areas where large tables can be pulled together in the middle of the action or with private dining areas upstairs. I'm ready to go back now!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place from start to finish.  The atmosphere is nice with the old movie theater theme. The bartenders were polite and seemed to enjoy discussing the liquor options (there were plenty), the wait staff was courteous and pleasant.  The food was amazing.  Parking is not great but it's downtown so you can easily walk or use the valet. Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Keep coming back because I always really enjoy the food, service and atmosphere.  Unusual to offer several items with lobster, especially in a beautifully restored movie theatre.
Disappointed with most establishments in Charlotte, my drive is 30 minutes but it's well worth it.  Highly recommended; one of the very best dining experiences anywhere around Charlotte.
Update:  Checked in  at WK 9 times since traveling to CLT one year ago.  Finally concluded that when I return home, I will miss WK more than any other place I've visited in NC.  WK seems perfect to me; everything is really wonderful here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome... from the food, to the decor, to the service! I have absolutely no complaints- just raves... 
            We had made a reservation a couple days in advance (it was Valentine's weekend), took advantage of the valet service, and were seated within a couple minutes after arriving. 
            I absolutely love the decor of the restaurant - very chic- and love that the kitchen is open.
           The food was so yummy, drinks were very well made, and we even enjoyed a slice of the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake (a MUST HAVE!)

I'd recommend it to anyone... Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best meal I've had in Gaston County! Not only was the food great, the service was exceptional. The staff showed true customer service by giving my boyfriend a signed birthday card (when we hadn't told anyone of the occasion). Will definitely return! 

Ps.. duck cigars are a must!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and absolutely loved the place. The unique atmosphere is a must see. Tori provided excellent service and even gave us a tour of the upstairs dining area. Loved the zucchini fries!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out Webb and we enjoyed our experience there. Love the style and atmosphere and our waitress was wonderful. Our group got the cheesy bread and duck cigar for appetizers and both were delicious. I had the Parma grana chicken - it was good and a huge portion (i ate it for 3 meals!). The potato cakes, while a good idea, lacked some flavor. My husband had the shrimp cavatappi and said it was pretty good. The appetizers and service were the best part. Looking forward to trying a less \"safe\" entree and some dessert next time!"}
{"text":"All of servers were so friendly! The bartenders knew flavors and the food menu very well. There are two levels go this restaurant, and the ambience is perfect for a girls night, or date night. Everyone knew the Chef's menu very well. Every protein I tried tonight was cooked to perfection. The bone-in Ribeye, the ahi Tuna, and the fried lobster were cooked to the most perfect temperature & still maintained flavor!"}
{"text":"First, our service was excellent!!!!! Our food Was very good.  My only complaint is with the wine selection..  A restaurant of this caliber should have a much better wine list!!!!!  When you order the house wine and it's terrible, unfortunately, that sets the bar for the remainder of the evening.  Serve a \"good\" house wine, that will change the entire evening. My two cents..... The cocktails are AWSOME"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week open on Sunday. Loved the entire set up of this restaurant. The food is very good and the service is very good. It's a little drive from Fort Mill, SC but really worth it. 

The restaurant was an old theatre and there's upstairs seating. This accounts for the 4 stars. The restroom is on the first floor. So plan accordingly when visiting. 

It a nostalgic place and old movie clips are playing on the screen. 

Would definitely return at some point in the future and have shared information about our experience with friends."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner here for my wife's birthday. Delicious meal, unique atmosphere, friendly staff. We will definitely be returning, maybe for my birthday!"}
{"text":"I came to Webb Custom Kitchen a few weeks ago to celebrate my best friends bday. She had come during restaurant week and loved it. I'll be honest though, had this not been the place she chose I never would have made it out to try it. However I'm glad she did because I really enjoyed it. The vibe of this place is really cool. They stayed true to it being an old movie theater and created a very TCM classic movie channel vibe. They had old TCM interviews that Robert Osborne used to do playing on the big screen over the kitchen, which was a tad sad since he had just died. Our waiter was a great help when it came to answering questions and giving suggestions. The drink list is great and I started with the High Society Martini. Later on I moved to he Malbec and it was delicious! We started with the mozzarella grille which was wrapped in prosciutto, very tasty, and then we got 2 bread baskets for the table. You do have to pay for the bread, which I was a little thrown by, however they all tasted fresh baked and were very good. For my main course I ended up choosing the Parma grana crusted chicken with mashed potatoes. It was enough food for two whole meals, however it was so good you didn't want to do anything other than eat it all! Dessert is an arrange of cheesecakes. Pretty mush everyone at the table got a different one so we could try them all. My favorite ended up being the plain cheesecake. Seriously it was one of the best I've had ever!! I had gotten the lemon one which was good and probably the second best, however nothing compared to their plain cheesecake!! Overall this place was fantastic, they even have complimentary valet, which is good because finding parking at their location is impossible. Now would I come back?? Ehh maybe for a special occasion. It's expensive and far away for me so it wouldn't end up on a regular rotation. However I highly recommend everyone try it and add it to your special occasion list!!"}
{"text":"5 Times there 5 stars each time. The place is just perfect. So glad we have Webb Custom Kitchen here in Gastonia. No just the best restaurant in Gastonia one of the best in the state. Looking forward to years of fine dining there."}
{"text":"Webb delights on every level! It's like a fine dining restaurant you'd expect to visit in a big city, but they take the concept and make it affordable right in downtown Gastonia, N.C. The food is creative, fresh and flavorful. The service is impeccable. The affordability is wonderful. And the atmosphere is so unique in the restored historic theater. This is Gaston County's best restaurant for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. I went there with my family on an out of state trip and had an amazing experience thanks to our waitress Lindsay. She was informative about the dishes on the menu and told us her favorites to try. From the hostess to the bar staff everyone was great"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and figured we should try it. We had eaten at a previous restaurant at the same location and were not as impressed.

We were literally blown away. We started with the Mozzarella Grille as an appetizer. We didn't read the description too closely, so when it came out, it looked very strange. Huh, what is this? It looks nothing like your typical \"mozzarella\" something or other at other restaurants. Upon first, tentative bite the flavors were amazing together. In each mouthful we tried to get all the different ingredients together for even more flavor explosions. Just like that, it was gone.

For our main course, I got the Spiced Rare Tuna and my wife got the Center Cut Filet Mignon. I am usually the more adventurous of the two. The wasabi on the tuna gave me pause, as wasabi is pretty hot. I ordered it medium rare instead of rare. Our food came out quicker than I thought it was (you never can tell how slow a place can be). Mine was in a bowl with a tall back side and looked delicious- the presentation was very good. My wife's looked more ho-hum- steak and a potato.

The wasabi was lightly drizzled on the tuna. On the first bite, the wasabi instantly cleared my nostrils, but was not overpowering. With the noodles, tuna, and assorted veggies mixed together in a single bite- it was heaven. At some point in my meal, my stomach told me to stop, but I didn't want to. I knew heated up again, it would never be this amazing. My wife's filet was thick, juicy and cooked to perfection. Crusted on the outside and tender in the middle, the one taste I had was one of the best filet's I have ever eaten.

We decided to try a dessert, even though I was relatively full. We settled on the upside down pineapple cake. It was good, but I was not blown away. It had a cream cheese layer that overpowered the rest of the cake. Upon discussion of what could be added, we asked for more strawberries and pondered what a strawberry layer would taste like (with half of the cream cheese).

Service was fast and attentive. Loved the atmosphere. Light music in the background, tasteful decor, light streaming through the front windows. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went here for lunch and they have a really cool set up. It has a old feel to it but it is updated nicely. Their lunch was reasonably priced and was delicious. They also have truffle fries which are amazing and you must get them if you have never had truffle fries before!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The waitress was wonderful and we felt very welcomed. Even with our small child in tow. The restaurant looks really nice and posh. The food though is somewhat bland. Not bad, just not very flavorful. I had the crab stuffed trout and the cheese grits on the side. The trout had a wonderful sauce on it that I wish was more of. Like, 3-4 times the amount of sauce. The sauce is that good. The grits were good, maybe a little more cheese. I didn't try my husband's meal, he had the salmon. He mentioned that it wasn't flavorful. My daughter had fettuccine Alfredo and the vegetable medley. That veggie medley was really good. I ordered a coffee, I was a little sad that there wasn't cappuccinos or lattes or other drinks as options, but the coffee was really great. I put a little bit of cream, no sugar, and it was wonderful. I should have asked about the beans."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Gastonia hands down for a casually elegant meal. I had the Filet and it was perfectly cooked. The Duck Cigar appetizer was amazing as well. The atmosphere is very elegant and relaxed. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Crab Cakes and OMG they were AHMAZING!! Great service and wonderful food. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Mousse cheesecake was great, not too rich but very tasty.  The large porterhouse has a good flavor but a little overdone for my taste.  With it being such an expensive steak I didn't have the heart to send it back.  The prime rib is fantastic.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about Webb, the manager Aaron, the owner Jim, just phenomenal people. The wait staff was awesome. 
One of the best versions of Shrimp and Grits EVER, my date was the worst part of the night, but she had a sea bass that was on special, I was able to taste it, I was envious immediately.  No kidding, the flakes slide apart like perfect ledges into stair shaped heavenly chunks. 
Just do yourself a favor, grab a date and go to this place, bring your credit card, it's NOT cheap, but the food lives up to the price!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and I'm going again this year for prom! I thought it was stupid to get ribs before prom but they were so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Can I give this restaurant 6 stars? Webb Custom Kitchen is absolutely phenomenal. Being in an old theater, this brand new restaurant features the most unique and incredible atmosphere. The atmosphere alone is a must see. Aside from that, the food was even more incredible. I had the Caesar salad to start and it came in a baked Parmesan shaped bowl that was so tasty. It almost tasted like the gold fish snack I had as a kid. So good. The Caesar salad itself was really good. I then had the bbq ribs for my entree. The bbq sauce was absolutely delicious. Definitely a must have. I had the potato pancakes as a side and they were also really good. The manager came by the table and was very friendly. He even told us about how the amazing cheese bowl for the salad was made! Our waitress was also very, very professional, courteous, and friendly. My coworker and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I can't believe it, but Gastonia has a 5-star restaurant! Everything was sublime. I am completely and thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"We ate at Webb Custom Kitchen as part of Charlotte Queen's Feast Restaurant Week.last weekend. We had heard a lot of good things about it and when we made our reservations, I quickly found out why. The confirmation reply was signed by Jim Morasso who is part of Epic Chop House in Mooresville and Chillfire in Denver.  If restaurant was anything like these two, we were in for a treat.

A little about Queen's Feast, Twice a year, a number of the top end restaurants offer three course pre fixe dinners at a very reasonable $30 to $35. Gives the restaurants an opportunity to introduce new customers to the restaurant and promote the culinary scene in Charlotte at the same time.

Webb Custom Kitchen is in a old theater in Downtown Gastonia that has set vacant for a number of year..  It's been totally remodeled but keeping with kind of an Black and White Art Deco theme from years past.  Movies are being projected onto a screen on the back wall just as in the old days and the kitchen is beneath the screen. From our vantage point, we could not see anything but the top of the screen and it movie as you would expect was in black and white.

Our reservation was for 4:30 pm which is earlier than we prefer but the reservations fill up quickly so something to keep in mind the next time.It was a downpour most of the way over from Cornelius so it took a bit longer to get there but we arrived just before 4:30. Free Valet Parking so we took advantage of that plus they checked my wife's wet umbrella when we walked in.

Hostess immediately took us to our table near the front of the restaurant and our server was right behind her like clockwork. She presented us with menus and asked if we were ready to place our beverage order. My wife ordered a cocktail while I had Hot Pear White Tea.

She explained the menu and also the fact that in addition to the Queen's Feast  3 Course Pre Fixe, there was also a 4 course King's Pre Fixe which had several other menu items and in the case of the Prime Rib, it was upgraded from a 12 to a 16 oz serving. Good Deal although the price increase to $50 but it was more than worth it. Actually it was worth more that the quoted price.

My wife chose to stay with the Queens Feast and I had the Kings's Feast

I started with the Angry Lobster as my appetizer which are lobster tails, lightly season and flash fried. Great start to a meal.  There are a few restaurants in the area that  serve Fried Lobster Tails but the seasoning made for a pleasant surpirse.

For our next course, we both had the Spinach, Frissee and Arugula Salad which proved to be an excelllent balance of taste and texture with the other components making it a delightful experience.

For our entrees, we went different ways.  The King's Feast had Duck Breast with Polenta. Ordered medium rare and it was, Not overcooked but moist and cut into perfect medallions. Presentation was excellent but come to think of it, the presentation the entire meal was excellent.

My wife had the Chicken Cordon Bleu with Mashed Potatoes. She thoroughly enjoyed it and since the portions were so big, she had it the next day as well.

For desert, we did a bit of mix and match. I had the Country Crock Break Pudding while my wife had the Pineapple upside down cake. She ate part of mine and I had part of her's and they were both fantastic.

The evening was a great dining experience and I enjoyed it immensely.

What I like about the restaurant and Epic and Chillfire is the attention to detail. Everything runs like clockwork and systems are in place in case something does go wrong, it immediately corrected and in most cases, the patron is not even aware of it.  Servers are well trained and motivated and eager to serve.. There is a lot of attention paid to detail and moreover, everyone works as a team. This attention to detail show up in the plating which is almost a lost art. The food not only taste good but is appealing when it is presented and it is obvious that someone has taken the extra time to make it a work of visual art.

what this translates to a great dining experience on the para to patorn."}
{"text":"What can I say, the drinks are wow, strong enough to know your having a drink but not over powering.  And the food is so damn good. Great atmosphere and wonderful friendly service.  

Sooo another Friday night here at Webb and again the drinks and the bar tenders are jam up.  We invited a couple friends and they agreed with us that the food is WOW.  And thanks to Jim for making us feel at home and personally meeting us and considering our ideas about the music, so very cool.

{"text":"Omgggg so good. 8 pm on a Saturday night, busy restaurant, busy bar, and still we got stellar service, and AMAZING food. The atmosphere is great - huge space but somehow still feels cozy and quaint. We sat at the bank of tables just outside the kitchen and every dish that passed us looked incredible. Portion size is ample, plating is simple, it was all ON POINT. The timing was perfect. We shared the Braised Pork Belly appetizer (GET IT), I had the filet medallions (freaking wonderful), and the husband had the Cowboy Ribeye. He was pleased (I stand by the medallions, though. They were better - the Prime Rib also looks great). The signature cocktails were tasty and the perfect amount of strong. We shared a slice of cheesecake, brought home lots of leftovers, and will TOTALLY be back. Loved it."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Gastonia to date. The atmosphere is great, decor is beautiful, sleek, contemporary, fresh addition to downtown Gastonia. I had the spiced rare tuna, this is the highest sushi grade tuna, drizzled with wasabi, it is really great, the portions in this restaurant are a little bit larger then my taste, but then this is south, ppl like their food here. 
I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"We had no intention of eating out tonight.  We stopped as the new sign caught our attention. We parked and walked up to see what kind of place this was.  The valert bragged so much on the delicious food as we looked at the outside menu,  that it convinced us we had to try it.   The atmosphere is wonderful.  

I love how they left the look and feel of the old theater.  Our waitress  DeeDee was the best.   The management came around to check how things were going.   Prime rib, smashed potatoes, buttered asparagus, crab stuffed trout, cheese grits, grilled vegs and a pecan chocolate bourbon pie like dessert.   Oh my, it was all so good.  

My suggestion, GO! Eat there.   Ask for the balcony, so cool, it over looks the kitchen.  Wonderful  all around.   Apparently they must let the employees sample dishes, so it pays off in their favor.  I love it when they know the food,  I love to ask what they recommend. What they think is best.  It makes me sometimes try something in on the fence about.   The nice valet guy brought us in (wish I could remember his name)and the food and service won us over to come back.   It was a relaxing, pleasant experience.  Yes it is a Lil pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First time guest, had the steak and crab cakes...which were delicious! Best steak I've had in years. The service was great as well...thank you to Lauren for making our first experience wonderful!!! She was a great server and was very knowledgable on the menu choices. Can't wait to come back and I will definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I haven't found many upscale restaurants in Gastonia. This one is definitely a splurge, but worth it. We didn't have a reservation and didn't have problems getting in, but i would definitely make a reservation next time. I think you get the best tables that way and there is a LOT to look at. Fabulous food, service is great, loved it."}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive from Charlotte.  Super cool as its an old theatre.  The architecture is great.  Our server (Victoria) was extremely polite and friendly, well versed in the menu offerings.  We had the Parker house Atlantic Salmon served over Lobster Risotto. The taste and portion was excellent and a very good value and served hot out of the kitchen.  The salmon was steaming when they brought it to the table.  Our table was great (in the balcony overlooking the restaurant,) and the old movies playing on the stage screen truly makes it unique in keeping that old theatre feeling. For a make your guests feel welcome...  the manager popped by and said hello with a friendly smile.  Very pleased!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a delicious dinner at Webb Custom Kitchen last night!  I ordered a High Society Martini and my husband had a Charlotte's Webb, both were phenomenal!  Our meal was a Cesar salad, New York Strip, and Short Rib meal.  Everything was dynamic in flavor and well prepared.  The drinks were wonderfully made and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful.  Our waiter was attentive, offered recommendations for meal choices and helpful as we selected drinks.  The steak was tender, well cooked and a good portion size for my husband.  The Short Rib meal came in a bowl on top of celeriac root puree and was delicious.  The portion size allowed me to take some home.  We would go back any day of the week.   This place is as good as it gets and we'd be happy to go back if in the area.  It is a great date restaurant."}
{"text":"this is one of our favorite spots! I love the truffle fries, the salmon, the kale salad.  The restaurant is beautiful Each time we are there, Aaron, the manager, (maybe he never leaves!) stops by the table with a genuine concern for our experience. I definitely recommend WCK!"}
{"text":"Webb's offered Great food and variety.  I had the trout and got a very generous portion.  Trout was cooked perfectly.  Service was fantastic.  Decor and cleaniness was top notch.  This restaurant would stand out even in a bigger city like Charlotte.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have to say this is my favorite place to eat in all of Gastonia, when will I be able to get Sunday brunch here??"}
{"text":"Date night with my boyfriend at Webbs. First timers! Started with two cocktails: the phantom and the one with river in its name... don't quite exactly remember the name. A+. Strong without being gross and very fresh and flavorful. Appetizer: mozzarella. SO GOOD. Entrees.... ribeye with truffle fries and filet mignon with smashed Yukon gold potatoes. Ribeye was the best steak we ever had and the filet was the second best steak we have ever had. Sides were very generous and delicious. Katie was our server and she was perfect. Very professional, sweet, and knowledgeable. We will be back asap! Don't wait to check this place out!"}
{"text":"amazing. just everything was amazing and the service was phenomenal our waitress was amazing she had dreads I can't remember her name but she was so sweet and honest and informative I loved it everything. we will be back!"}
{"text":"The food in Gastonia is usually awful but I work here and have no choice. This place is absolutely fantastic. Service, food, atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went to Webb's Custom Kitchen last night for my birthday and it was delicious! From the Hostess, bar staff to the wait staff....great service! We had Filet Mignon, potato pancakes, and a wedge salad with cheesy bread appetizer and it was all really good....best steak we've had in years... Aged meat so tender you could cut it with a butter knife! Our waitress, Lexia was very attentive and helpful...we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here during Restaurant Week to celebrate my birthday and was really excited because of the history of the restaurant building and the beautiful ambiance of the restaurant. 
The restaurant was pretty easy to find and somewhat right off the highway. We were glad to see there was complimentary valet parking especially because it was raining the night we went. 
They accept reservations and I'm glad we made them because it was pretty busy but it was a Saturday night and RW. Even with reservations we had to wait about 10 minutes the hostess told us they were running behind. 
We were seated on the lower level in front of the open kitchen which was nice. There is also a projector screen behind the kitchen that plays old time movies in black and white. On our way to our table, we almost slipped and busted our tails. We just thought it was us until we saw other customers slipping as well. We told our concerns to the hostess and she stated they know about the floors being slippery and its because of the oils from the kitchen. I don't know if that is valid excuse or not but if someone falls it will probably not turn out good. We were a little nervous to walk to the restroom or back to the front of the restaurant to leave. 
Our waiter was really nice and very attentive. We started off with drinks and we ordered The Phantom. We both loved our drinks and ended up ordering another Phantom. 
For our courses we ordered the 3X3 onion soup and Cheesy bread and we both ended up ordering the prime rib with mashed potatoes. I liked the onion soup but thought the cheese was a bit much, I couldn't cut it or break it apart to eat it so I just ate the around it. The cheesy bread was really good! The prime rib was really good size and we both could not eat it all so we had enough to take home. We did eat all of the mashed potatoes and had none left to take home. They were really creamy and had a lot of flavor. By the time our dessert came we were 
extremely full and asked for it to be boxed up to go. We ordered the bread pudding and the cheesecake. The bread pudding was really good and almost melted in your mouth. 
Between the excellent service and beautiful ambiance of the restaurant, we will make the trip back to Gastonia to enjoy Webb Custom Kitchen, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We had a very nice time there on their one month anniversary of opening.  The inside was really striking with a lot of attention to detail.  The service was really outstanding.  The food was delicious- I had the center cut filet with blue cheese and my wife had the salmon.  For dessert we had the chocolate bourbon pecan pie, which was perfect! The whole experience was great and I can't wait to go back.

PS - good news, Jim- we live in Belmont (moved here from WI a few months ago) so we will definitely be back and telling all our friends to go, too!"}
{"text":"Just be clear... this updated review pertains to the entire restaurant outside of the 10 foot radius directly inside the door (I'm hoping that made Jim smile just a little).  Rarely does such a bad first impression turn out to be hands down the best dining experience we've ever had, but Webb Custom Kitchen absolutely floored us with their hospitality, attention to detail, and amazing selection of food and drinks.  Our previous experience was immediately attended to by the owner, with a phone call and offer to please come back and give them another chance to prove what they were all about.  I don't think that this visit could have gone any better, the professionalism and courtesy shown by all of the staff we encountered was truly first class.  What made this 2nd chance so special to us was the fact that the owners and managers were 100% genuine and wanted nothing more than to make up for our previous bad experience and show us an amazing time.  Mission accomplished Webb Custom Kitchen, what a great place with an amazing atmosphere and people.  I encourage anyone who may have come here and had a bad experience to give it a second try.  Mistakes happen,  unavoidable circumstances arise and sometimes things just don't work out as planned, but give them a second chance and you wont be disappointed.   Thank you again Jim and Aaron for a special evening, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great dinner spot. The restaurant is set in an old movie theatre and gives it a really classy ambiance. It wasn't crowded which was surprising considering how great the meal turned out. There is a movie playing silently above the open kitchen. Our server was Lucy and she was attentive and polite. We got the wings and cheesy bread for apps, and also split a Caesar salad, all delicious. The wings were enough for 2 people to share and we still took 3 wings home. The cheesy bread came with 6 pieces so we each tried one and took the rest home. The salad was well dressed and came in a baked cheese bowl, which was both pretty and delicious! For our main meals I got the duck and Benton got the dry rub ribs. We shared truffles fries as well, which were well seasoned and delicious. We had plenty to take home and the prices were reasonable. Everything came our quickly and was well presented. We shared the upside down pineapple cake for dessert, which was a lovely way to end the meal. As we left every employee we passed wished us a good evening and thanked us for stopping in. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place for dinner!  The food was outstanding, and the atmosphere was open and relaxed.  This was an old theatre which was totally refurbished but maintains the old charm atmosphere, with a thoroughly modern and clean appearance.  Wait staff were courteous, friendly and  prompt. The salad and salmon, combined with the beet side was amazing.  Great craft beers to accompany. Definitely returning again!"}
{"text":"Heading into Charlotte we found this wonderful restaurant in Gastonia for dinner. Free valet parking was the first indication this was no fast food joint. The bottom line the service was great. We mentioned to the server that we were in a bit of a hurry. Our salad was excellent,  we split the smaller cut of prime rib and that too was delicious and the side mashed yellow potatoes were the best we ever had. The servers were great the atmosphere was very tastefully done as well."}
{"text":"Literally JUST walked out of this place.  This was our first time here, and chose this place because of the Yelp reviews.  We were seated at a little table wedged between 2 other larger tables.  After 16 minutes, we were never even asked what we wanted to drink.  The place was not overly busy, and there was no wait to get a table.  5 servers passed our table, and one hostess cleaned a table right next to us, and all the while we still had menus sitting on the table, and no drinks or anything.  It was pretty obvious we hadn't been helped yet.  So, we just quietly picked up our things and left.  Don't know if we will be back...."}
{"text":"Great place for a celebration.  My wife and I came here for our 48th wedding anniversary dinner and were not disappointed.  We have been here now 4 time in the last 2 years and have had a great experience every time.  Tonight we sat up in the balcony area and had an intimate dinner for 2.  In fact, this is the very best upscale restaurant in Gastonia.  From the hostess who cares, to the wait staff who are terrific (we had Dillon tonight), and finally to the quality of the food and it's presentation, this place is the best."}
{"text":"Christina and Zack made our dining experience tonight a great delight. Not only was the food delicious, but the service was top notch! Attention to detail and southern hospitality at its finest. Thank you, Webb Custom Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Gastonia! We went there for dinner on our way from Charlotte to Asheville and liked it so much that we went there for lunch on our way back. The service was excellent - the GM stopped by our table both times to check in on us - and the food was delicious. All of us were pleased by our meals. They only had a few vegetarian options but were very open to adapting dishes to meet our dietary restrictions! The atmosphere was also cool (it's a converted movie theatre in which a film is projected on the wall above the open kitchen.)"}
{"text":"This is where I take all of my Charlotte friends to when they visit me in down town Gastonia. I have taken 3 sets of friends to dinner here, 1 of which was an anniversary dinner and none of them have left disappointed! The food is amazing and the staff is always friendly. One thing that sets them apart from most places to me is their consistency! They have never served a mediocre meal, its always top notch! Plus its absolutely beautiful inside! By far the perfect place to sit is the upstairs balcony overlooking the dinning room and kitchen. Perfect place to take a date!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is delicious and   not too pricey. We are fine to make the drive from Charlotte to Gastonia for the great service and amazing food. 
To get: duck cigars, duck fried rice, prime rib is a must! Stuffed trout, ribs. Drinks are always yummy!! We r trying something new tonight -- cowboy steak!!"}
{"text":"Awesomeness, the appetizers were awesome,  elegant and our server named Taylor was knowledgeable and very well mannered. The food was incredible as the other restaurant owned by this  owner called Epic chophouse, both are awesome, however this place is unique and surprisingly flavorful, interesting and magnificent... looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Overall fantastic experience, cheesy bread appetizer was awesome, as were the angry lobster appetizers.  Our waiter was well versed in the entire menu, really seemed passionate about the food he serves.  Drinks were delicious and creative. What a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Myself and a few coworkers ate here for lunch today. This was my first time at this restaurant. The food was excellent as was the service. The greeter/hostess was friendly and greeted us with a smile which started the experience off on the right foot. Our server, Dee Dee, was excellent. Friendly, professional and new the menu stone cold. The restaurant was very clean and the decor was warm and inviting without being over the top. I really enjoyed dining here and the charbroiled chicken wings are delicious! Yes, it's not \"cheap\" to eat here and I wouldn't want it any other way. It's quality food and a quality dining experience and to me it was worth every dollar I spent. I'm looking forward to bringing my wife for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"First, I want to wish this restaurant all the luck in the world. I have never seen a better job of adaptive reuse in a theatre. This spot has held a failed restaurant, a failed dinner theatre, and probably a few others I don't know about. Webbs really deserves to succeed!

We were there for a weekday lunch, and there was a respectable group downstairs. The iced tea was good but surprisingly priced at $2.95. Now, before you react strongly, know that it came in a real glass and not one of those plastic tumblers, it came with a large and just-cut wedge of lemon, and when the volume dropped below half, our server brought me another full glass with another lemon wedge.

We sampled three appetizers. Here are our thoughts in order of success. The chef's daily soup was black bean and tortilla. The first bowl was rejected because it was just barely lukewarm; this is a big complaint -- don't serve soup unless you *know* it's hot. And the replacement took a long time; the other two appetizers had been eaten before it arrived. Sadly, the taste was not worth all this. It reminded me of Amy's, which is a very good canned soup, but I was expecting a deeper flavor and better viscosity. The next item was better. The \"Cheesy Bread\" was a slice of baguette-style bread covered with a thick cheese topping. The cheese flavor was full and satisfying, though the overall effect was too heavily salted. Last was the clear winner and what Webb's is known for -- the Duck Cigars. I recommend that you get these at every visit. They are good by themselves, and they come with three dipping sauces. The filling is made from ground duck confit and vegetables and is wrapped in a delicate spring roll style wrapper and then fried: Great taste, multiple textures, dipping sauces, and fun to eat.

Next, we tasted the Crab Mac & Cheese. This was even better than the Duck Cigars. There was plenty of crab, generous butter and cheese sauce for the macaroni, and it came hot and golden brown. If you like mac and cheese and crab, then this is beyond satisfying. Also, it comes in a cute little cast iron dish. As a side dish, we tried the baked beans. This did not work out so well. The beans were well under-done, not even to \"al dente.\" The vinegar and the sugar were not well combined, so the sauce presented different tastes depending on where you tried. Our server mentioned that others during lunch had made this comment, so it would seem that this was not the normal product.

The kitchen is open, and I observed professional behavior throughout. The cooks are seriously trying to prepare and serve high quality food in a spotless kitchen. The menu is quirky and therefore interesting to me. You will not be bored! The interior is clean and beautifully restored and decorated with more to come, I'm told. Parking is not easy, but they offer valet in the evening. They are adding custom wine storage and that by itself is worth another visit from Charlotte after the next two months. If you are near Gastonia, give them a try!"}
{"text":"We will start with the guest service, from the host to the general manager... Every single person we came in contact with outstanding! The food was delivered pretty quickly and it was very fresh! The salad was crisp and the ingredients were very fresh! My steak was cooked perfect and was so tender! The pineapple cheesecake was like heaven! It is on the expensive side but you definitely get what you pay for!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good little gem in downtown Gastonia.  If you go when they have their Country Crock bread pudding, you MUST try it!  Have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"We attended a lunch on Mother's Day and had a fabulous experience! The service was attentive and helpful. The food was outstanding! The cheesy bread is not to be overlooked and the cheesecake... THE best I have had in NC! It is slightly high in price, but such an awesome place here in Gastonia for a special night out. Management came to our table a few times to ensure everything was satisfactory, it was beyond! Webb is a must visit!!"}
{"text":"Great space! Service was generally good but a little spotty i.e. Two out of four glasses of wine came first and one soup arrived long before salads. Very creative menu. Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"My parents were visiting from Michigan and we were looking for a \"decent\" place to eat that wasn't fast food or a chain. My mom found Webb's. I'd never heard of it but their menu looked AMAZING...and so different than restaurants around Gastonia. 

Boy were we in for a surprise: 

Atmosphere- from the time you walk through the door your eyes light up with the ambiance and decor of the old theatre. Did I mention they have valet complimentary parking?! The open kitchen concept is neat and I LOVE that you can sit in the balcony (on the weekends) and watch the movies they play on the theatre screen!

Food- one word: FABULOUS!  I moved from Florida and have been longing for a place of this caliber. I had the duck duo combo. It was so tender and flavorful. The veggies were cooked to perfection. Soft, but yet still slightly al dente. 

My mom had the salmon served with the corn and lobster risotto...oh man..so good!  All of it...but the risotto was mouth watering! 

Service- 5 star. No auctioning of food. No matter who brings your dinner they know exactly who is eating which dish. I waited tables for 12 years, so this is HUGE for me!! The server had answers to our questions. Food was prepared quickly and to perfection. Hats off to the chefs! 

If Webb's maintains the level of service and the creative/unique/delicious menu they are offering, this place will be around for a long time and I'm sure will have a wait most nights. We were there on a Thursday and the main level was a full house. 

Can't wait to surprise my husband (who loves the cinematic arts) for a date night here!!! This might be out new \"date night\" locale even though we live in Shelby-- a 25 min drive for us."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews and hearing how good this place was I decided to make a reservation for a birthday dinner. Fortunately Tuesday's aren't busy so we had the entire restaurant to ourselves with our server L.A. providing wonderful customer service. 

The restaurant is stunning! You'll find yourself staring at the beautiful structure along with the brilliant idea of maintaining the cinematic experience of what used to be an actual movie theater. 

From our 2nd floor balcony booth we could see the Magicians in the kitchen cooking up some GRADE A food with ease! It was very satisfying observing these skilled chefs work and the end result will have your taste buds flipping out! 

I ordered the USDA PRIME KANSAS CITY STRIP a
bone-in 20oz. aged prime strip steak which was succulent and delicious! Their golden Yukon mashed potatoes were perfection! 

Our second entrée was the SLOW BRAISED SHORT RIB OF BEEF with mashed Yukon Gold potatoes, ginger glazed carrots, port wine demiglace. I'm not a vegetable person, but I can honestly say that those ginger glazed carrots were the best carrots I've ever had! 

Surprisingly we managed to leave room for dessert which was a Upside-down Pineapple Cheesecake with a candle for the Birthday Girl. Most places will offer a complimentary cake for the Birthday person but this wasn't on the house. They did however give the Birthday Girl a birthday card signed by some of the staff which was quite nice. 

A manager did stop by our table to assure everything went well and we were pleased. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We were impressed with the building as well as with the food.  We tried an array of food including the fried lobster, cheesy bread, and mozzarella to start.  All were good, with the cheesy bread being our least favorite.  It may sound strange, but it was too cheesy for the amount of bread. For the entree we had tuna, prime rib, duck, and short rib.  Again, all of it was very good, with the short rib being excellent.  We had the pineapple upside down cake for dessert, and it was amazing!  Overall all of the food was good to excellent, friendly service, good pacing of food, and really neat architecture."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner. Crab cakes were great. I had the ribs. Very tender and wet sauce was tangy and sweet. Had the loaded creamy potato it was to die for. This is my second visit there. Last time we had the lobster and The aged ribeye. Both times the food was so filling and top quality.  ( Great prices compared to Charlotte you would pay double the price for this quality of food) The ribeye was just as good as Morton's at a fraction of the cost.$40 morton's would cost at least 80 to 100. I was unable to get dessert which I regret not saving more room for it. This restaurant is a must go to spot. The Owners really care about quality and your full satisfaction. Even the waiter was excited about the menu and the food and the quality that he even mentioned that the owners visited the meat processing plant to see if it was up to their standards. This place is top notch.  I can't wait to go back. Help support our local fine dinner buy going here often it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Amazing place! We \"grazed\" on appetizers as we wanted to try so many items. Every item was flawlessly executed. The service was warm, knowledgable and attentive without being overbearing. A \"DON'T MISS\" if anywhere in the area!"}
{"text":"We made a fairly last minute decision to go to Webb Custom Kitchen for my dad's birthday and were overall very impressed. They offer FREE valet parking and even if you opt not to valet, there is plenty of parking near the restaurant. We booked in advance on Open Table and were pleasantly surprised to see that our table was on the edge of the balcony overlooking the kitchen with a great view of the movie screen and the dining area below. Speaking of which, upon entering the restaurant, you immediately notice how truly impressive the restoration of the old movie theater turned out. Compared to the typical Gastonia restaurant, Webb Custom Kitchen is a clear standout when it comes to the quality of the space alone.

The menu is movie-themed and we started with a few appropriately named cocktails: From Russia with Love (Moscow Mule) and the Steve McQueen (similar to an Old Fashioned with rye whiskey). We also opted for the Angry Lobster and Fried Green Tomato appetizers, both of which were very good. 

All three of us went with steaks for our mains: one filet and two prime ribs. All three of the steaks were ordered medium rare and all three arrived medium and there was a mix up with the sides on two of the plates. However, all three of the steaks were excellent in flavor and the side issue was easily rectified. None of the issues were serious. The sides were fairly standard in type and quality, but the Lobster Risotto was a definite standout. I think the risotto was a $6.50 upgrade, but well worth it. 

We decided to share the orange creamsicle cheesecake for the desert and were happy with the choice. The restaurant did add a big touch of class for dad's birthday. We did not make his birthday known except for casually mentioning it to the server. Not only did the cheesecake show up with a birthday candle, but they also gave him a personalized birthday card that was signed by the staff while we were there. The card included lettuce seeds that can be planted. 

In short, don't think twice about giving Webb Custom a try. There were minor issues with steak temperatures, the side mix-up and some service slowness at times with prolonged periods without drinks. The absence of an upstairs restroom is also unfortunate. However, these issues were a mere footnote in what was a great experience overall. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good. My favorite part of the meal was dessert, blackberry cheesecake. The drinks were amazing. The decor is the most amazing part of this place. It is gorgeous on the inside."}
{"text":"My SO surprised me with this for date night.  It has great ambiance, food was delicious!  The staff was friendly and prompt.  I had filet mignon which was prepared exactly how I ordered, could cut with a butter knife.  He ordered chicken cordon bleu which was also perfectly prepared.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the week off of work and decided I would finally check out the lunch service at Webb. Of course I was blown away from the selections on this menu. Too many good things to decide from. I went with the Sgt. Pepper sandwich- so wonderful with a side of the vegetable chips. Amazing lunch service! Definitely will have to figure out another way to get the chance to try other items on this lunch menu. Very good selections, different from the dinner menu which was nice to see."}
{"text":"Was brought by friends for NYE and enjoyed everything!!!  I have been called a food/service snob but everything was perfect.  Staff worked well together and managers visited tables to insure perfection.  The food was prepared just perfectly for all at our table.  If you are reading this to see if you should go - The answer is YES!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Clean and crisp - Dining Area, Service and Food. Beautiful restaurant setting in an old movie theater. Really well designed. We were greeted and seated promptly by a very nice young lady. Our server Chris did an excellent job. Our Appetizer was delivered soon after ordering. The Fried Green Tomatoes were an easy share for the three of us. Our sandwiches were quite good and plentiful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice meal with a great atmosphere!  Had dinner upstairs with a view of the kitchen.  Not real Hungary so I had a wedge salad and wings. Both were awesome and I plan on doing it again real soon."}
{"text":"Love it!  Such elegance. The food is presented beautifully. Prime rib was rocking it tonight!  Caesar salad was fabulous!  But seriously the coconut crepe brûlée. Wow!  Logan took great care of us. They always make us feel like family"}
{"text":"Made our first visit tonight and was most impressed.  The restaurant is just beautiful. It is a step back in time with great care taken to highlight the unique building.  We happened to come on the restaurant's first anniversary.  Lucky us as complimentary glasses of champagne were served.  We started out with drinks at the bar.  Wine pours were generous and a good selection of mixed drinks and beers.  We were seated in the balcony with a wonderful view of the movie screen and the extensive renovations.  The menu was eclectic and had something for all tastes.  We started with the duck cigar-appetizers which were quite tasty and came with three different dipping sauces. There were 2 large cigars each cut into 2 pieces.  My husband ordered the tuna steak with udon noodles and wasabi drizzle perfectly cooked.  I had the New York strip, medium rare.  It was excellent with a most flavorful mushroom sauce.  I had the mixed vegetables as a side and ordered the creamed spinach both very fresh.  We topped off the evening with the chocolate mousse cheesecake.  A very lovely evening.  Every area of the restaurant looked inviting and it was nice not to be crammed in but able to relax and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has 5 stars. 

From the moment you walk in you know it is going to be a unique and memorable dinning experience. 

The atmosphere is spectacular. It is so pretty inside and they play old movies on a big screen in the background. 

The food is incredible. We didn't need a reservation and we were wearing blue jeans, it was so classy without being pretentious. 

We are several appetizers, like cheesy bread, pork bellies. They were all so good. 
I had the duck for dinner and tried some of the prime rib. The duck was cooked perfectly and so moist and flavorful. 

The service was exceptional. There was an issue with someone's steal at our table and without saying a word the service took it back and had a second delivered by the chef himself. 

We tried all the desserts after dinner. We had one of each and just shared. The New York cheese cake was the best cheese cake I have ever had. 

If you find yourself in Charlotte, do yourself a favor and check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's hard to change out of your sweatpants and leave my 10 mile radius from the middle of Charlotte.  Webb Custom Kitchen gave me a reason to leave my bubble.  This restaurant is so unique, being that you're dining in an old converted movie theater.  The decor is a mix of art deco and modern, for an updated feel of the historical Webb Theater.  You have movies playing on a large screen in the back above the open kitchen, while old movie reels are framed on the wall.  This restaurant is a pretty big space, so it can certainly accommodate large or small parties.

When Monday is 1/2 price wine bottle night, it's easy to keep the drinks flowing!  Wines have a decent markup, so you can get a pretty decent bottle for around $15.  Most of the wines are in the moderate range, while there are a few bottles on the higher end. Cocktails and fancy Martini menu looked great and certainly fit with the vibe of the restaurant!

The food was certainly worth the drive.  For an appetizer, I highly recommend the Mozzarella Grille.  It's an elevated version of a mozzarella stick, but WAY better.  The cheese is wrapped in prosciutto, breaded and fried, so it comes out this warm, delicious bite of goodness.  This was followed by the Tenderloin Medallion entree, which came with three small pieces of steak on bread topped with a blue cheese sauce, accompanied by a baked potato with all the usual toppings.

I can say with certainly that everyone enjoyed their meal!  If you're looking for a fun experience outside of the Charlotte area, I would certainly take Webb Custom Kitchen into consideration!"}
{"text":"Wow! Gastonia really needed a place like this. I remember dining at the same location about two years ago when it was a steak house and was bummed out when it closed. This new recreation/reincarnation blows away the old one. Same great space but with a very different, more approachable vibe!

Our waiter L.A. did an amazing job taking care of us during a relaxed multi course lunch. He was friendly, and very attentive without smothering you.

Very glad to see local beers on tap - a select few ones, even more by the bottle and a nice wine selection. I'm always ready to enjoy a pint of Triple C 3C IPA.

We probably ordered way more than we should have but the menu really makes it a difficult decision; there's a lot that sounds goo.

The 3x Onion Soup and Wedge Salad were the perfect starters for us - that Blue Cheese dressing is heavy, creamy and addictive.

Both main courses were good sized portions, and in retrospect we woulda, coulda, shoulda split one after the big starters (but I'm glad we didn't). The Braised Ribs were tender, well sauced and served over mashed potatoes. The Crabcake sandwich was the same width as the very large bun and about and inch thick with a decent ratio of crab to filling; I can appreciate that you could have a proportionate bite of everything with each bite. The Remoulade was tasty especially with the zucchini fries, one of their most popular sides.

Had a very nice dining experience here - definitely recommend it. We did drop about $60 on lunch (cough, choke) - but we literally ate our faces off and had a couple beers to boot."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed with the food. 
The atmosphere was amazing! The service was amazing! The drinks were great. The food was not as good as it looked in the pictures, was described on the menu or reviewed. 
It was all bland and cooked wrong. Maybe there was a new chef last night? I don't know but what I'm seeing and what I tasted differed greatly."}
{"text":"This place...ugh I can't even begin to explain how lovely and amazing it is. The Interior is perfection. The whole throwback to Hollywood had me as soon as I sat down. They play some move original score pieces and I am totally in love! The food was so flavorful and was just soooo freaking good! I swear Gastonia has a gem and they better do everything to keep it. Not too often that they have food and martinis of this caliber. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Super dining area! Restaurant is in a building which used to be an old movie theater and they have taken full advantage of the space. One of the nicest restaurants I've eaten at in the greater Charlotte area. The food is modern American fare with a very nice and reasonably priced cocktail menu. Went for lunch, can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Webb Custom Kitchen a couple weeks ago and I have nothing but wonderful things to say! 
First off, the menu is beautiful and the dishes/drinks we ordered were even better than expected. The prices are very reasonable and I am already craving the filet medallions. Next, the staff was so welcoming, accommodating, and professional. It has been a long time since my husband and I have had a waiter as good as Taylor! (and we eat out a lot!) Additionally, I had specific seating requests that Christina specifically facilitated. The owner clearly cares about his guests and restaurant as he was checking in on tables all night, including ours. Finally, the ambiance is unique and offers a little something for everyone. Because of the various dining levels and large bar, you can be seated in an area with more energy or in a more secluded, quite section. 
I can't wait to go back and over time try most of the menu! I do not write reviews often, but when I find somewhere as wonderful as this, I am compelled to share!"}
{"text":"Stopped at WCK on our way to Atlanta. The service and food was wonderful!  We all tasted from each other's plates and agreed that all entrées were delicious. I love seafood and the lobster was cooked perfectly with a delicious Caribbean sauce. Definitely trying to stop back by on the way home!"}
{"text":"This is the easiest 5 stars of all times. Webb Custom Kitchen is a seriously impressive establishment. My husband and I had one of the absolute best dining experiences eating here - if not the best. The quality here makes you feel as if you're in one of the greatest culinary cities in the country.

Absolutely gorgeous inside, our bartender was awesome, everything on the menu is creative, different and unique! It's unlike any menu I've seen before, it's so exciting!!! The portions are perfect and the food beyond delicious. We loved everything so stinkin much from the Parma Grana Chicken (artichoke sauce!!!!), the Duck Fried Rice (better than any I've ever had) down to the Bleu Cheese Stuffed Olives. We were able to have a substantial amount to box up and bring home.

Side note about how good the food is: we just purchased a house in Dallas, NC but still have our apartment in NoDa, Charlotte for another month -about a 35 minute drive. We forgot our leftovers in the fridge in Dallas and realized after we got back to NoDa.The very next day we drove all the way back (we weren't planning on making a trip to Dallas until the weekend) just to get the leftovers because the food was THAT good. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"Met up with friends from Charlotte today for lunch! What a treat! The food was amazing - beautifully presented. It was classy, clean and every one that attended to our meal was careful and friendly. We were able to meet with Jim, the owner (who I evidently think should have been named \"Allen\"...but I digress!...
We now have a restaurant in Gastonia we can enjoy on a regular basis without the drive into Charlotte. Kudos for the atmosphere, the choice of décor and the many ways we enjoyed our visit today!  We heartily recommend this for an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the 1st time.  Loved the atmosphere and the food was really good.  The prime rib with a baked potato was awesome!  The cheesy bread appetizer was also very good.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came from out of town to dine here for New Year's Eve. We made a reservation for two for the last seating of the night and took an uber with the intention of getting a bottle of champagne and staying to watch the ball drop on the movie screen. I had just updated my license and was given a temporary paper license. I was told my the waiter they would not accept that (I'm almost 30). While it is a state mandated form of I.D. I  understand they have the right to refuse anyone so I just said alright and moved on. We were placed at a tiny table right next to the stairs even though there were plenty of empty tables and we were the last seating of the night. Felt crowded and slightly noisy. We were told the tables had all been planned for the New Years seating but most of them remained empty over the next hour and a half. I loved the old movies playing on the screen during dinner but the music was very distracting. For example: listening to Johnny cash and then the theme song to game of thrones was less than ideal for a romantic holiday dinner. More reminiscent of medieval times than a classic old theater. First course was delicious, second not as great. We barely saw our server and when we did he seemed less than thrilled to be there. He gave us one word answers and couldn't answer some of my questions. Multiple times we watched him standing around talking downstairs while other servers ran our food. When it was time for the third course we were told they were out of what we both wanted. He ordered salmon medium and it came out well done. I ordered my steak MR and somehow it came out undercooked. It was cold and chewy. By the time the server came back to check on us we had given up on the evening. We asked for our food to be boxed and our fourth course to go and rushed home to eat our dessert and toast at midnight. I will say the dessert (orange creamsicle cheesecake) was absolutely amazing. We were both really excited about our dinner not only because of the holiday but also because we do not get to see each other often. I had read some good reviews for this restaurant and it was just really disappointed that our experience was so terrible. Definitely not worth the $150 for food and tip. Considering going back one more time because of all the great reviews, but honestly I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, set in an amazing renovated theatre with tiered balcony seating overlooking the kitchen and bar with a giant screen showing old movies (sound muted). Go for the food, go for the experience."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this place. Fairly new and had lots of good reviews. Great atmosphere , great service. The food is definitely one of best if not the best in town. It is pricey but totally worth it. You will not be disappointed. I would definitely go back. If you are looking for great food this is the place. And of course the service is awesome."}
{"text":"My only experience at Webb's was disappointing. My steak was charred and tough even though I ordered medium rare and my father in law's prime rib was chewy and tough. To charge so much money for food like that is sad. But I will say the staff was very friendly and accommodating. I might try another menu item someday when I have the extra money to spend."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim after my husband flew into CLT on our way toward Asheville. The word exceptional does NOT do it justice!!! This was hands-down the best meal I've had in years. The menu is creative and unique. We lucked out with a table on the mezzanine, where you can view the exposed kitchen and prep. The absolute coolest ambiance. Every single thing delivered to our table (cocktails included) was truly over-the-top!!! It's not at all fitting for the area. It's brilliant of them to offer free valet parking. I cannot wait until we are in the area again so we can eat there again!"}
{"text":"My second trip to Webb Custom kitchen was disappointing. Service was so slow. It was not worth the wait.  My prime was over done. I thought it would be as good as the last time but it was not. The only excuse for the wait was that they were busy. We had several people come by an apologize but the food just did not come out. We got there at 7;30 we left at 10:30. That was not our plan.  We ordered( 2  wedge salad, 2  prime rib  and chicken ,trout dinners were ordered and  1 desert)."}
{"text":"On our way from Atlanta  to DC we read reviews of this place and it sounded pretty good. We sorely underestimated it. There were few items on its extensive menu that didn't appeal so it took some time and the help of our excellent server Andrew to help us choose. We can attest to the shrimp and grits, Ocean 11 sandwich, flatbread and prime rib sandwich. Prices were quite reasonable, the atmosphere was very nice and Andrews service was as gracious and helpful as it gets. Webb would more than hold its own in big city DC. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Actually my husband made the reservations online first and then called twice and spoke to two different people once to say there would be 4 people then called again told someone else and told then it would be 6 total and they were a surprise - secondly NO manager every came to our table - only the waitress asked and we told her about the ribs and about the sweetness of the salad dressing and  we didn't finish what was on our plates and she ask do you want a to go box and we said no - I am not going to argue - I just won't be back"}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews on Yelp, I decided I had to try Webb Custom Kitchen during Restaurant Week and I was not disappointed! Every course was delicious and the service and decor was great! I can't wait to come back and bring my family when they come visit!"}
{"text":"This is the second best prime rib I have had in my 40 years of life.  Top notch all the way.   Tha is for the great meal.

Josh, the server was great too."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with a friend. This place is amazing and visually stunning to look at. The building was previously a movie theater and you can still see the screen (on which they play old movies), equipment, movie curtains...etc. You feel compelled to look up and all around as you dine. Really cool vibe. Although, at one point they cranked the music up so loud we could barely hear each other speak. The service was prompt (it appeared that our server was actually training a new server but she did really well. The new server's name was Sydney).  We both ordered the crabcake sandwich. I ordered a side of truffle fries and my friend ordered a side of the zucchini fries. All of the portions were generous. The food was delicious. I'm deducting one star because when they brought out my truffle fries I asked the lady - who was not our server, she looked like she was maybe a manager - if there was any type of sauce that she would recommend for me to dip my fries in other than ketchup. She gave me a weird look as if I had just asked her to take a trip to the moon. I actually had to give her examples of what I meant. And she still had this \"you're annoying me\" frown on her face and actually said to me \"no ,I'm sorry I don't have anything.\" She wasn't even willing to think about it and offer me any suggestions. Finally, I just asked her to bring me out the same sauce that my friend had for her zucchini fries which was the Siraccha sauce. I don't know why I had to go through all of that with her just to get a little bit of sauce. Anyway, other than that small exchange I would definitely dine here again. They have a lot of interesting things on the menu that I am eager to try."}
{"text":"Gaston County, this is your best restaurant. This is an amazing building with a beautiful old world ambience. The food was outstanding: try the artichokes, tuna, trout, salmon, or steak. The waitstaff is extremely attentive. Definitely go to this Gastonia gem!"}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness, what a hidden gem.  If you have not visited this new addition to the downtown Gastonia nightlife, you are missing some wonderful food. 

We started with the Duck Cigars.  To die for...literally could have eaten an entire meal of these  and been happy as a clam.  Husband had the caesar salad in the \"edible bowl\".  Wonderful, reminds you of the cheese crust on your mom's mac and cheese.

I had the Prime Rib, blackened with blue cheese.  Flavor combinations were outstanding.  Meat was tender and juicy.  Puts Old Stone to shame. Not even on the same level.

My husband had the dry ribs.  Nothing but bones left. He wants to try the BBQ sauce next time.

We were seated in the balcony. Lovely area.  Service was outstanding.  Dessert - Pineapple Upside down cake for him, cheesecake for me.  Nice New York style 5 inch high slice with a good texture and flavor.  A good cheesecake does not need any sauce.  It is delicious on it's on.  Coffee hot and strong.  

Could not have asked for a better meal.  Will definitely recommend it to friends and family.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Jim Morraso... 
1. After a ruined Valentine meal, due to being served the wrong item, having to wait for the correct item to be made and brought to me and then finding a bone in my fish and not being able to finish eating my meal. What if I had choked on that bone and it got stuck in my throat, then I wouId have had to go to the hospital. A bone is serious, people choke on that. So I asked you to comp our meals and you said you would. Thus we didn't walk out on anything. 
2. The waiter put my order in incorrectly and didn't bring my husband the beer he ordered when his meal came to the table. I am not tipping for bad service.
3. My husband was not complaining about his meal because he didn't want to upset me further at the restaurant. It was a Valentine Celebration and our first one as a married couple and he knew I was not happy because of everything that happened. 
4. I am not trying to disparage you or your business. The purpose of YELP is to let people know ones experience at a restaurant. 
5. It was a half hour before I had the food on the table. You said it was coming right out and it took 30 minutes from the time they brought out the wrong plate of food to bring out the correct plate of food. 
6. I have eaten seafood at many many restaurants in my life and never once have I gotten a bone in my fish.
7. Honestly I came with high expectations of a fine dining experience in Gastonia. Sadly I highly dissapointed."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I found this local gem. With a backdrop of elegance and old movies playing on the screen, you can come casual and enjoy a great meal.
I had the duck confit appetizer and blackened prime rib with blue cheese. Regretfully, no room for dessert.
Prices are a bit more than average but this is no average food. Great eats!"}
{"text":"After all of the glowing reviews, I decided to give this place a try this past Friday and didn't have the experience I had hoped for. I understand that restaurant week is chaotic everywhere but, this place took the cake. I made a reservation online and the only slots available were for 9pm and 9:30pm so I booked the 9pm for my boyfriend and I feeling it was a bit late for dinner but, didn't mind. Upon arriving 5 minutes before 9pm, I told the hostess that I had a reservation and she told me that my table wasn't ready yet, but would be shortly. Okay, cool... fair enough. Once it got to 9:30pm and saw other people being seated and still no update on the status of our table, I was furious. I went the the hostess stand where 5 hostesses were chatting amongst themselves and 1 manager and said that considering I made a reservation, it had been 30 minutes I wanted an update and was clearly frustrated. I'm thinking it'll be 10 before I eat the first course. Another 10 minutes later our table is ready. Another 15 before our waitress arrived to take our drink order, now we're at 9:55pm. She asks what we would like to drink with zero apology for the wait nor friendly what so ever. (Okay, it's been a long night, she's exhausted... I get it so I'll leave it be) My boyfriend ordered a beer with a glass of water and I ordered a glass of wine. After reviewing the menu we put in our order, still no drinks but I'm trying to be cool. We get our first course, 10:08pm I got cheesy bread bites and the boyfriend got lobster bisque soup and it was really good... but I wanted a drink.. still no water... no drinks. Nada. But the first course. Wow. So our server comes to ask how we like it... I finally as polite as a I could say it's great but a glass Of water or my drink with it would be better. The rest of the experience was just as awful and boyfriend got the wrong dessert but, wasn't worth even mentioning to the server... food was just a simple, \"Fine\" and the experience was beyond awful."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week.  This is probably the nicest restaurant in Gastonia.  The food and service are both outstanding."}
{"text":"This is such a great place. Old movie theater turned into a restaurant. The staff is incredible. They are kind, great at their jobs, smiling, and helpful. Managers walk around to make sure you are having the best night. The food is out of this world. It is delicious food with lots of flavors. I haven't had anything I didn't like there (although their lobster risotto and lobster bisque are my favorites). If it's your birthday the staff write you a card that was created by a local business, seeds from a local business, and you are able to grow the seeds. They really care about the downtown area of gastonia. I've had maybe one or two of their mixed drinks and they have been great; not too sweet, not skimping on the alcohol, but also not so strong it's unbearable."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Gastonia!! I've lived in NYC for 5 years and have eaten at my share of good restaurants. Webb Custom Kitchen is right up there with them in terms of quality of food, service, and ambiance. 

I came during restaurant week and had the shrimp cocktail, Caesar salad, duet of filet mignon and crab cake with pineapple upside down cake.  No exaggeration- everything was wonderful. I also tried my dads appetizer the pork belly- melted in my mouth it was perfectly cooked!!  We all  shared my pineapple upside down cake and liked it so much we ordered 2 slices to go!

The venue is gorgeous- an old theater. Be warned there are stairs if you are dining with older guests but the view of the screen, open kitchen, and bar are worth it!  Free valet make parking a breeze.

Last but not least the service- incredible!! The owner himself, Jim, showed my dad upstairs when he was snapping FB pics of the bar from the 2nd floor. The 3rd floor view was amazing. The manager also came by to check on us as well as our server. The entire staff was attentive without being pretentious. Made the dining experience!  So glad to have found this gem in Gastonia now I don't have to go all the way to Charlotte when I want a decent meal. It's a great place for a special dinner but also casual enough to drop in to catch a game at the bar. If you've read this entire review, I'll see at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had the crab cakes and lobster risotto for entree. Appetizers were great!!! Duck Cigars, Pork Belly, Cocktail shrimp, and wings. Good cheesecake for dessert. Drinks were GREAT...Customer Service was Great!!! Decor was amazing from the old theatre. A very nice hidden gem in gastonia."}
{"text":"Made the trek to Gastonia to try Webb Custom Kitchen.  In all honesty, I had never been to \"downtown\" Gastonia, but Webb Custom Kitchen is right in the middle of it all.  Typical southern city downtown with multi-story brick buildings... WCK is a restaurant that used to be a movie theater.  They carry the theme throughout: clever drink names, movie theme music in the background, and the whole place has a \"old school hollywood vibe\" which makes for a really unique dining experience.

Our server Andrew, handled our table of 7 brilliantly as we all arrived at different times and we were all taken care of with drinks and cocktails.  1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays ;)... so we took advantage.

Since we were a large group we ordered a main dish as an appetizer that we could split, the crab-stuffed trout.  We also ordered two orders of duck cigars.  Very tasty way to start our meal.  Then we got to the business end of dinner by splitting the beef short rib and duck duo plates with carrots and duck fried rice (we were all about the duck that night).

Overall a great dinner experience in one of the most unlikely of places.  The old movies playing in the background of what used to be the screen was a nice touch as well.  I love how the entire kitchen lives in the first couple of rows where the theater seats use to be and how this restaurant gives new life to a space that used to be something else."}
{"text":"Webb Custom Kitchen is a slick, well-run restaurant in the heart of downtown Gastonia.  My first impression upon walking in was that it's not the kind of restaurant you'd expect in such an area, so it was a very welcome surprise.

Our table wasn't quite ready when we got there at 7:30 for our reservation, so we got some cocktails at the bar.  I started with the Steve McQueen, which is bourbon, bitters, simple syrup, and a twist.  It was tasty, if a tiny bit too sweet.  It had two cherries muddled into it and I think it could have done without them.  Overall it was good, and my wife enjoyed her drink whose name escapes me at the moment.

Once we were seated, we started with the mozzarella grille, which is prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella with a balsamic reduction drizzle.  This was a great way to start our meal, and the roughly chopped tomato and basil it came with helped to cut the richness in each bite.

We were really hungry and split a second starter: the caesar salad, which comes in a parmesan tuile shaped like a bowl.  Their caesar is absolutely delicious and the tuile is a joy to eat.  The croutons are garlicky and the entire thing is well-dressed.

For our entrees, I got the special du jour which was called \"Three Little Pigs\".  It was a pork chop topped with an apple-bacon relish, served with andouille farro.  The pork chop was cooked above my requested medium, but it was still tender and juicy.  The sweet and savory relish paired well with the chop.  The andouille farro was tasty, but it was missing something.  It wasn't a very cohesive side - it was pretty much just chunks of sausage served with a pretty plain farro, without a sauce or dressing or anything.  The andouille needed some crisping, too.  It still tasted good but was the weakest part of the dish.

For dessert we split their blackberry cheesecake, which was divine.  Our server did an excellent job upselling us with a blueberry dessert wine, which while tasty, at $14/each for a very small glass of it, wasn't quite worth it.

The service here is excellent, and the decor is great.  We've been here probably about eight or nine times now, and if I could give it four and a half stars I would, but since I can't it gets four.  It would be a five-star experience if they were more consistent with hitting the requested temperatures for their proteins.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Once again I had the opportunity to dine at Webb Custom Kitchen and was not disappointed.  This is by far the best restaurant between Charlotte and Asheville.  I had dinner there last night with two friends, and we had a relaxing evening dining and catching up with each other, and while we treated like celebrities by the staff, the food was definitely the star of the evening.  We thorougly enjoyed petite filet mignon, deconstructed beef wellington, extra sides of vegetables, with a grand finale of creme brulee.  I am never disappointed when I go to Webb; whether it's lunch or dinner, week night business meeting, or weekend fun, it is THE place to go for fine dining.

Webb Custom Kitchen is located in an old movie theatre, but it is certainly a sensational new place to dine in Gaston and the surrounding counties.  This rising star of an establishment has an atmosphere that is perfect for business dinners or romantic evenings out when you want to savor the moment (as well as the flavors) and just relax with that special someone.  While you are there, take just a moment or two to appreciate some of the lighting that helps create that ambiance--actually made from some very old film found on reels in the building.  And feel free to ask the staff about the history of the building.  They'll be happy to share what they know, although most, if not all, of the old movie posters were lost in a fire some years back.

Amazing appetizers range from Duck Cigars to Angry Lobster, and anything in between, and I have yet to be disappointed with any soup or salad I've ordered there.

Entrees include a wide variety from which to choose; each of them is the result of a stellar performance by the kitchen staff, under the production and direction of Executive Chef Jon Spencer.  The Cab Aged Ribeye is outstanding, as are the crab cakes and tenderloin medallions.  And let's not forget the ever popular prime rib--served by many restaurants, but few manage to prepare it as well as they do at WCK.  

And if we are going to liken entrees to movie stars, then it is only fitting to liken the side orders at WCK to rising starlets that can be as intriguing as a film noir...and at times they perform their role so well you just want an encore.  Glazed mushrooms, ginger glazed carrots, and asparagus with hollandaise are always popular, but the lobster corn risotto and truffle fries are definitely worth of top billing.

WCK's custom cocktails, variety of both craft and bottled beers, and their wine list only serve to enhance your experience.  The only thing left to review is the dessert menu, and unfortunately, I cannot do that.  I've always been too full after my meal to enjoy anything additional other than a cup of tea, but the desserts I have seen taken to other tables looked as splendid as the rest of the food at WCK.

The challenge when dining at WCK is deciding on which items to choose.  And unfortunately, when you are finished dining, the servers (who are stars in their own right) get to ask YOU for your autograph (on the bill, of course!). Read less"}
{"text":"Couldn't do 5 stars great atmosphere food was delicious my husband had the aged ribeye was done exactly as ordered. My dish was a disappointment I had the fish special. It was extremely tasty just small for the price. It almost felt like it was the end of the evening and they didn't have a lot left so they reduced the portion size. It was extremely small 4 bites and it was gone. I just felt like it was an app portion and for the cost I wanted more!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this spot for awhile finally had time to check it out. We were apart of a large group. We had called ahead so there was no wait, we were able to sit right down. 

The ambiance is classy, yet casual. I wouldn't dress like a slob and come here, but you don't need to put on your Sunday best. 

There was the old movie playing on the big screen. From our table we couldn't really see what was playing, but it was nice background noise. I would like to come back & sit higher up. The inside, as you can see in the pics is freaking dope! There is a box of lights on the wall to the right that I want for my home. Nice touches all over. 

Our waitress was well mannered, knowledgeable about the specials, and was attentive enough without being intrusive. 

She, and all the other staff we interacted with were professional, I can't place the difference in the staff here, but it's almost like they are of a higher caliber than most restaurants around Gastonia. I appreciate the manner in which we were served here. Makes you feel fancy :) 

I ordered a craft beer, the Hoppilachan (sp?!?) and it was delicious as always! Loved that there were local beers, as well as, classic national craft beers. I don't really drink cocktails, but the menu was pretty extensive, and my co-workers were raving about the wines. 

For dinner, I had the spinach salad with walnuts, goat cheese, and it was crafted to perfection. Just the right amount of everything. 

You are served on these funky, yet clean looking contemporary dishes whoever set this place up put a lot of love into it. Little personal touches can be found all through the restaurant. Come to my house!! 

Everything came out quickly, and the kicker is it all came out together. That speaks volume to the team at Webb. It's normally an issue to get a large groups order to come out all at once. I really appreciated that. It's awkward to have one or two people having to wait for food while everyone else eats. We were all pleased, and shared our dishes so I was able to try the crab cakes, salmon, parm fries, steak. All to die for!! . 

Shout out to the kitchen & wait staff, you guys are the real MVP's!!"}
{"text":"Started with Duck Cigars for Evan to try, very good. We had The Wedge salad, and blackened prime rib, Airport Chicken & Filet  Medallions. Had to bring dessert home. Everything was Absolutely Delicious!! Our server was DeeDee, very knowledgeable and attentive!! Great food, Great service, Great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"If you have never been here you must go and go NOW!  The interior is absolutely amazing.  It feels like you have stepped back in time 60 years.  If you can manage sitting in the balcony I highly recommend it. The food was delicious and the portions were very large.  We went during restaurant week and were able to try out a a lot of their menu.  None of it was the least bit disappointing!"}
{"text":"Webb Custom Kitchen was a dining experience!from the time we walk in the door. the beautiful Decour, the atmosphere, the music, the staff. The Food was Phenomenal .it was truly an experience.  
The restaurant definitely was a five-star experience."}
{"text":"Favorite Place to grab food in gaston county.. Shoot, probably one of my favorites in the greater Charlotte area!! A Must try place with great service!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this place. Food was fantastic & the service was just as good. Can't wait to go back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"So I came here for my sister's birthday with my parents and a very discerning friend. She and my sister live in Charlotte and have been trying to get here for a while. I came from Durham where we have a plethora of awesome restaurants.  
Anyway....our waiter was Dillon, an awesome waiter with spectacular taste and recommendations.  We made the best decision to come at opening time (4PM).
I ordered my mother the crab cakes, my father the Wellington medallions, myself salmon cakes, my sister got the pork chops and our very selective fried got a salad and crab cakes.  For appetizers we had Angry Lobster and the grilled chicken wings.... these were incredible! 
I thoroughly enjoyed my Blue Cheese stuffed Dirty Martini and my wine suggestions of the Zinfandel that Dillon suggested.
The ambience was lovely as was the entire restaurant. 
My parents really enjoyed their meals.  They shared the Blackberry Cheese Cake.  My sister got the Crème Brulee and I got the Pecan Tarte. I can't wait to return.  So I will give it a respectable amount of time between visits, but I can't wait to get back!!"}
{"text":"In town for the day. No way am I eating at Arby's. These guys should be proud of the work they are doing. I've invested in 2 restaurants & these guys have their act together big time. People take notice."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place was renovated an opened! I had been wanting to go for some time. Such a great addition to the growing culinary scene in Gastonia. And now this is THE place to go when you're dress to the 9's. Valet parking is available also. It's downtown Gastonia and depending on the time you go, trying to find a park can be a challenge. Aesthetically, this place is STUNNING! I love that they keep the character of the old theater and the open kitchen is a feast for hungry eyes! We sat close to the kitchen and by the end of the night, I wanted to place a few more orders. Ive also visited just to have a cocktail or two and the bartenders have been very accommodating and professional. I would love a Sunday brunch, or simply to be open on Sunday's which is a bummer. Overall, one of my favorite places to dine or cocktail in Gastonia."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Gastonia so far! Food and service was off the chart. I'm obsessed with the crab cakes and flat iron duck (MUST TRY). Their salads are also very good and fresh. Can't wait to come back and try all their other entrees. I recommend making a reservations because they do get quite busy around dinner time. Plus they offer free valet parking!"}
{"text":"Came in a few weeks ago with friends for lunch. We had the zucchini fries and root chips as an appetizer. The zucchini fries were not what I expected however they turned out good and the sauce that comes with them was soooo good. I thought they would have been cut bigger. They ere cut like shoestring fries. The root chips were a little greasy, however they were good and tasty. I would definitely go back again and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came for drinks and appetizers. Taylor was our server and he was amazing also the food and drinks were amazing, as well as the atmosphere of the restaurant. Everything was perfect for a girls day out!"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal restaurant with stellar service, delicious food, great ambiance and an attention to detail that makes for a memorable dining experience. We recently went on a Wednesday night and we're able to get a table in the upper balcony area with a superb view of the state-of-the-art kitchens and the great movie screen where old black-and-white movies add to the vintage feel of an astonishing remodeling of the old movie house where old and new come together to create a stunning effect. The place was bustling with customers even on a Weeknight, but our server, Angie, made us feel like we were the guests of honor and her sole responsibility. We started out with signature house cocktails. I highly recommend their \"From Russia with Love.\"  The Duck Cigars are an outstanding appetizer that is delicious and copious. Their Prime Rib is heavenly and served with optional fresh horseradish and au jus, it melts in your mouth. Whatever you choose from their extensive menu will surely be a hit. Thanks again to the management and staff for making our night memorable, and we will definitely return soon.
9/27/17. We returned again to Webb's for a special tête-à-tête dinner and were again wowed and made to feel special. A cozy table upstairs in the balcony affording a beautiful view of this breathtaking restaurant. Our server was personable, attentive and professional. And of course the cocktails and the food were all perfect.  Delicious, beautifully presented and quite copious. Pair that all with a great Malbec on which the Manager was kind enough to give us some great background, and it made a special evening even more memorable. Thanks to all the team at Webb's. I only have one suggestion (which I did voice to management while we were there, it would be nice to have a really good espresso after such a nice dinner. I know we generally like to finish an exemplary meal out with that and some after dinner liqueurs. Give it some thought!  But needless to say, we'll be back and I will toot your horn to everyone!  Thanks."}
{"text":"A 1920's theater converted into an unforgettable dunning experience! The open kitchen with balcony seating is all breath taking! A true gem in the downtown city of Gastonia! Perfect for an intimate dinner or birthday celebration! Not only is the atmosphere inviting and warm, but the food is just that amazing! We will definitely be coming back! This is a must try! Bon'Appetiti!"}
{"text":"I am still find it super  wonderful that this  place is here in Gastonia!
What a special restaurant   It has character  and great food. 
I haven't had anything  I didn't love. They put care in the quality and preparation .
This is where I bring my food snob friends . This place is worth trip to come here from Charlotte 
I've brought my family and even grandkids who love it too
Alway staff that knows the menu and how things are prepared.
GO HERE! PLEASE we should support this local superstar"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the Webb Custom Kitchen! Excellent food, service and atmosphere. All in all, a great place to enjoy your dinner. 
The restaurant was built inside of an old theater and it's so nice to see that they kept a lot of interior setup the same."}
{"text":"Smack Your Momma Good! My husband and I tried this place out for the first time tonight. Do yourself a favor and go eat here! We tried the Duck Cigar; by far the best spring roll we've ever had. If you like pineapple upside down cake, try the Crimson Tide Martini! Hubby had the king size prime rib with cheese grits. His review = delicious. Cooked perfectly with a raw horseradish dip on the side. I had the crab stuffed trout with fried green tomatoes and cheese grits. Best. Entree. Ever. Amazing flavor, no fillers, and they use food from NC. You can't go wrong with Webbs! And make sure to order the cheese grits!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food but a bit overpriced.  We enjoyed ribs as an appetizer and prime rib.... Yum!  Since my first visit we have been back 2 additional times.  Each time we have ordered different menu items.  So far everything has been great.  My favorite has been the beef medallion over pasta!  It was the size of a small roast! And the chocolate mousse cake was absolutely sinful!!!"}
{"text":"Order the grilled pork chop medium well came to the table medium rare two levels away from what it should have been.. sent it back many apologies... 10 minutes later it was then overdone ..more apologies I was so hungry I ate it ...no offer of Goodwill not even a complimentary dessert no adjustment to the bill not that I was expecting it but no one offered anything I won't return"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. We had 7pm reservations and arrived at 6:53pm. We were told it would be about 10 minutes which was understandable but 7:15 rolls around while other people who walked in after us were seated and we go a \"I don't know\" from the hostess. The food was bland and not flavorable at all. I will say our waitress was nice but this place is not worth the overpriced food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Will definitely be back. Portions are large and my steak was cooked to perfection. Ambience is very cool too."}
{"text":"Gastonia has a culinary delight worthy of a big city!  This place is a gem. Very impressive from the decor and theme, to the staff, to the food.
The waiter was very professional and courteous.  He was also very knowledgeable of the menu and what goes into preparing the food.  
The owner stopped by our table as we were waiting for the food.  He was very pleasant to visit with.  He has another restaurant in Denver, NC. and one in Mooresville, NC.  I would like to try them someday.
This place has class and character.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago and traveling frequently, I have a chance to visit many restaurants.  Webb Custom Kitchen ranks with the best!  Beautiful setting,  great food, great service. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  These folks really know how to manage a restaurant.  The food is top notch, and there is an old movie theater screen inside that shows old shows/cartoons.  Very atmospheric :)  Don't miss it, Gastonia's best!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant ever!!! The prime rib is to die for and the service has always be impeccable!  They treated us so well last night for Valentines Day, it is always a treat to go there!  Thanks Webb Custom Kitchen for what you do!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is first and foremost an atmospheric experience. The shell of the old theater is played up in tiered seating and the kitchen is a focal point below a movie screen showing vintage films. Given that we were there during restaurant week there were things we would not expect to see or have happen. We arrived at 4:30, first course came to the table at 5:22- entree 6:15 and desert 6:57. The problem with having the kitchen as theater - we could see our food waiting to be picked up. Plate rims were dirty on several dishes. 
We will come back and give it another try. Honestly, our steaks were soooo good. Perhaps the staff was overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Just a very pleasant experience from the moment we got out of our car and valet was there to the last bite of dessert and waitress took our valet ticket and car was waiting. Wow. Great service, great menu choices, great food with a twist. Artichokes for appetizer and pineapple cake for dessert and lobster and steak in between. How good can it get?  Meredith was our server. Polite, helpful but not intrusive."}
{"text":"Found this gem on way to Charlotte. Had to order take out for lunch. Food was very good will be back for a dinner date for sure. Would recommend trying out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Greenville, SC. Very nicely set up space in a decorated historic firmer theater. Service was you sand the food was better. The lobster and duck roll appetizers were very good. However, the pork chop was one of the best I have ever had. I highly recommend it. This place is worth a stop."}
{"text":"We had an awesome birthday dinner on Friday night for my Mom here. The staff is very polite and very knowledgeable about their menu. Owner/Manager even took time out to thank us for coming!! Awesome Customer Service!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Talking to my Dad he found this place during Charlotte's Restaurant Week and told me that the next time I make the trek down from NJ, that we had to go here. He was 100% right, it is as delicious and amazing as the majority of these review read.

I'll only be going over the food that myself and my GF ate, as I didn't taste any of my Dad's entree or my Step Mothers. 

We were suggested by our server to try the Cheesy Bread as it was one of their strongest offerings as an appetizer, and we weren't lead wrong at all. This was cheese bread on steroids, maybe dusted with a bit of crack, but I kid. The entire plate was gone within a matter of minutes, the gooey cheese plus the sweet roasted garlic were flavor harmony.

I decided to try the Caesar Salad Theater which is described as; crisp romaine, parmesan tuiles, garlic-mustard emulsion, herbed focaccia croutons, shaved parmesan. Now, when I hear tuile I think of like little rolled pirouette wafer cookies, what came out, was the entire salad bowl made out of parmesan cheese. Very inventive presentation and it was super delicious being table to break away at the cheese \"bowl\" and add it to the salad as I wanted. My GF stated that the next time we would come back she gladly get that for her entree with chicken.

For our entrees I had the Bone in CAB Aged Cowboy Ribeye with a fully loaded baked potato, and my GF had the Parma Grana Crusted Chicken Breast with the fully loaded Yukon gold potatoes. 

My ribeye was perfectly cooked to the requested medium rare. As someone who doesn't get to eat many steaks at home, this was a great treat for myself. My baked potato was stuffed the gills with all the fixings you would expect, plus it had a nice crispy outer skin.

My GF thoroughly enjoyed her chicken dish, and was happy to see that the chicken was dried out. A lot of times you find that some breaded chicken can be on the dry side, and this wasn't. She was a bit nervous of the artichoke cream sauce as she's not overly fond of artichokes, but she didn't have any complains what so all.

My Dad and Step Mom had the Pork Loin Chop and the Prime Rib respectively and both enjoyed the entrees. 

We were too stuffed to sample any desserts, but I can say that anytime I find myself back in the Charlotte area I'll be going out of my way to dine here. Everyone that interacted with us was nice and cordial, and couldn't be more helpful whenever we needed anything or had any questions. 

Reading some of the reviews I find it funny complaining about the prices, but I guess coming from NJ, and going into NYC a lot, I find the prices to be very cheap especially when you look at the quality and quantity of food you receive.

The only thing that was slightly annoying was the fact we were sat maybe 20 minutes after our reservation time, Now this can easily be out of the control of the restaurant if people linger too long, or people just don't show up. However, this food was well worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Webb wins in my book! I hate that Webb is all the way in Gastonia as I live in Huntersville but the food is outstanding and the ambiance is unbeatable!  My husband and I joined them for Restaurant week last July and while some participants in the event seem to offer less, Webb does not do this! We had the tempura lobster for an appetizer which was out of this world good! I enjoyed a filet and my husband the rib eye, both of which cannot be beat!  If you have not already viewed pictures of the restaurant, I encourage you to do so as it is set in an old theater, and there is seating on the original balconies!  Above the open kitchen there is always an old movie playing which gives a very cool vibe!
I LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant a 4 star review last year but since then, our experience has been disappointing to say the least. About a month ago we returned and I ordered crab cakes as I had done before. There was hardly any crab meat but the manager took care of the problem. We returned on June 20, 2018 and had the same problem with the crab cakes except there was even more breading. Our server brought a different manager who assured us this was a fluke; that their crab cakes are \"97 percent lump crab\". The one good thing she did was to take the plate so she could show the chef the problem.  It's obvious the emphasis on atmosphere and table service is predominant. I doubt we will return because the food, although artfully presented, is over priced. Paying $25 for two scoops of breading and mashed potatoes is ridiculous! For $25 a salad and bread as well as a side should be included no matter what is ordered. We will opt for Safari Miles in Denver, NC. The atmosphere is not as nice but we get good quality, well prepared entrees and salad, bread and a side are included. If you go to Web's, you will love the atmosphere and service but expect over priced food."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best kept secrets of Gastonia county!! 5 star steak house with a classy/elegant atmosphere, and the best prices I've seen for the quality of food being served!! Hats off to to owner and chef of this fine establishment. I recommend this restaurant to everybody that has yet to try it!! Awesome food, great prices, and huge portions!"}
{"text":"Deedee (not sure if this is spelled correctly, I'm sorry if not) was amazing!  Wonderful service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"What a cool atmosphere! The food was inventive and delicious. They take a good twist on staples like caprese and upside down pineapple cake without going too far out in left field. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stumbled here during our road trip passing Gastonia, NC. Yelp reviewers raved this restaurant so we gave it a try. This restaurant definitely has a potential to be more upscale. Contemporary interior design and open kitchen, plush dining furniture, the list goes on. Dress code is casual, though. Some dressed up to enjoy dinner, while some others were wearing athletic leggings or cargo shorts. Staff were very attentive and welcoming. Food? AMAZING! They featured innovative menu, felt like I was dining at Culinary Institute of America, without breaking the bank! We had Duck Cigar, Daily Special Salmon with Sriracha glaze, Prime rib with Blue cheese, and cheesecake. We absolutely liked everything, even the fries tasted so fresh! Portion size is big enough to not leave you hungry no matter what you order. If you go there, cheesecake is a MUST-TRY!! Even if you are full, take it home for later lol"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good steak, so I tool to Yelp to read reviews and see what was in the area since it was all new to me. I decided to give Webb Custom Kitchen a try because of the great reviews it had. Well, I have to say, I did not get a good steak. I got an EXCELLENT steak!! Charlotte has some really awesome steakhouses and one right off of South Blvd that has been there for MANY years was....up until I went to Webb's....the best I had ever had. I have to say, I have never in my life had a steak that was cooked to perfection like the one here. It was also perfectly seasoned. I got the prime rib blackened with blue cheese. I will most definitely be back, and I will be bringing all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place. What can I say great atmosphere, great food , great drinks. The  Meiomosi was priced very low. The more money u have left for food. Lol. The short ribs will always be my favorite."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on the way to Asheville for the weekend. 

First of all, the space is absolutely beautiful! It is converted from an old theater and they really did a terrific job sticking to the theme. Old movies playing on the big projector screen above the kitchen, lots of movie related decor throughout. Given the origins, the dining room is really open with enormous ceilings and just make the whole environment feel amazing. There is also an upstairs section that would be perfect for an event. For the size of the restaurant, it's certainly pretty empty in there during lunch time. I don't know if it gets any better for dinner or weekends, but driving through Gastonia, I don't get a sense that the restaurant quite fits with rest of the town...

Anyways, a solid lunch menu from salads to sandwiches and entrees, lots with Southern inspiration. We weren't super hungry and both opted for soup and small salad combo. And shared truffle fries of course. The CORN AND CRAB SOUP was yummy and the salads are ginormous for being the small size. It would be a full size anywhere else... Both the CAESAR and the KALE SALAD were fresh and done very well. The TRUFFLE FRIES were stick thin and perfectly crisp!

The only star deduction comes from the slow service. Despite a pretty empty restaurant, it took quite a while to get a food. Otherwise a nice lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Back again and so glad I did! It was so hard not to order the fried green tomatoes with crab again since they were one of the best appetizers I've ever eaten....but I wanted to try something new.  Enjoyed the Duck Cigars with 3 dipping sauces as well as the angry lobster!  So good, I made it my meal!  Great service , especially,  Jen  at the bar!  Wow, she's excellent with the many locals as well as making tourists feel at home! Definitely worth coming to ear; unexpected gen in a relatively small town!  And the decor is fantastic since its an old theatre turned into a restaurant;  they have a big screen TV with B&W classic movies playing, no sound as they typically play show tunes or movie sound tracks!  Love this place!  Second time is a charm!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is awesome! Love the fact that they kept the old movie house feel including the old 35mm artwork on the wall. We started at the bar with the truffle fries and somehow there was an extra order of the angry lobster and duck cigar that appeared for us which was a nice surprise! The angry lobster was delish and reminded us of a larger fried shrimp with a dip that felt like hollandaise sauce. If ya love duck cigars are for you - the duck flavor was very strong. As for the entrees the crab cakes were huge with very limited filler and probably could be shared by 2 people. Other favorites for the table was the salmon, mac n cheese and the beef medallions. The staff was very attentive and had their southern hospitality at the fore! This is a place I'd highly recommend if you're looking for a unique place with good food!"}
{"text":"Once again my husband and I are having a wonderful meal at Webb's with absolutely outstanding service. He had the pork chop and I had the salmon with lobster risotto. AMAZING!
Thank you for being consistently awesome over the past year!"}
{"text":"The Webb Custom Kitchen is truly a gem in Gastonia.  It is housed in the former Webb Theater in downtown Gastonia and has lovingly and meticulously been converted into a super chic sophisticated restaurant, I can't adequately describe it but check out their FB page. Grand opening is Wednesday. When you are ready to ditch the ordinary and channel your inner Frank Sinatra or Marilyn Monroe, this is the place to be. 

The Food:  Like the Webb's other 2 sister restaurants (Epic Chophouse and Chillfire Bar & Grill), expect top of the line steaks and seafood, cooked to perfection.  Lots of choices and something for everyone.  On two separate dining experiences, I've tasted filet mignon, prime rib, burger (10 oz!), lobster tails, crab cakes, lobster mac & cheese, ribs and more!  I've never had a bad meal here (or at any of their establishments for that matter!!).
The Libations:  top of the line selections and generous pours (like you would make for yourself at home!)  They have an extensive bourbon and vodka selection.  The wine list is top notch with varying selections and price ranges.

This is NOT your chain restaurant, Gastonia and is unlike anything else you have here.  This place is very much worth the drive from Charlotte and surrounding areas.
Just.Go."}
{"text":"Found this place online while checking out the Summer Concert Series in downtown Gastonia.  I live an hour away and thought it looked cool and I love restored and repurposed old buildings in historic areas.   So without reservations on a busy Saturday evening in the summertime I ventured in.  Valet was most gracious and even parked \"Dixie\" up front as she was a hit as usual.   Upon entering, hostess's were most gracious and eager to accommodate. I requested a seat at the bar. The large u shaped bar is dead center upon entering the lower dining level and very inviting. Many people enjoyed a cocktail and conversation while awaiting their table briefly. Couldn't help but to overhear many locals recalling the days of the old Webb theater and the fond memories of a simpler and peaceful time.  Several first timers also in the house. Also noticed many young couples as this is always a good sign for future growth. The entire staff was very attentive from the bar staff to the server that brought the food promptly. Good beer selection from mainstay to local brewery options. Bottle and draft and a nice wine selection reasonably priced. Glasses from $5.00 and bottles from $18.00. Two tv's above bar area just where you could see if needed to at bar counter but didn't distract from the overall ambiance and out of site from tables. The main dining room and mezzanine dining opened up to the large area of the main seating area in the old theater and they have an old movie playing on the screen above the kitchen area which further reminds you of the quaint buildings unique history. Diverse menu with many options from appetizers to main course including aged angus filet mignon(which I ordered topped with blu cheese)  and they offer many toppings, and glazes. Prime Rib, short rib, pork,chicken,shrimp,crab cake,trout and even duck,meat options abound with creative styles consistent with the ambience. My filet was cooked to perfection with a slight char on the outside from the grill as desired. Tender and moist and a generous and filling 8oz portion. The Yukon Gold mashed and asparagus were perfect complementing sides and prepared just as correctly. Ordered the cheesecake to cleanse the pallet as I usually order desert after having a glass or three of wine and it was the most fluffiest that I have ever encountered. So thick I had to take half home. Jim, the managing partner made his way around speaking to every patron as if he had been friends forever with everyone inside. Sharing stories of the history of the building and the reclamation that he so-boldly embraced.
  Long story short, I will definitely be making this a routine stop in my rotation from now on\""}
{"text":"My family and I spent two and a half hours here celebrating my birthday. From our fabulous waiter LA we learned so much about the different types of food that they offered. This young man was a spectacular host. We never lacked for anything. We met the manager Aaron at the end of our meal. He spent time and spoke with us. He was very friendly and said he looked forward to seeing us again. The atmosphere was remarkable: the food was excellent; and the entire night was a success. Thank you Webb Custom Kitchen for bringing some class back to the area. Looking forward to your new endeavors."}
{"text":"The food is great, staff is amazing and the place is beautiful. We were late to our reservation and decided to wait for a table on the balcony. Ended up waiting over an hour. Once we were seated we were told dessert was on the house because of the wait. This surprised me because we were the ones late so even though it was really our fault the restaurant still went the extra mile to makeup for our wait!"}
{"text":"Built in 1926, the movie theater that Webb Custom Kitchen is built in is a true piece of history. You'll be serenaded by cinematic music (whether that be instrumentals by Hans Zimmer or Ewan McGregor from Moulin Rouge) and have a movie playing in the background (in our case, it was the 1972 film 1776, starring Mr. Feeney from Boy Meets World haha) and just surrounded by pure magic. Ambiance and decoration are on point, and they've kept so much of the memorabilia from the original facility that you'll forget you're in a restaurant.

Monday is half off bottles of wine night, and almost everybody took advantage of that. The Lady and I ordered a Zin and Andrew, our server, was more than happy to let us try it before we committed. 
Our group started off ordering the duck cigars, crab stuffed trout, and wrapped mozzarella. All were wonderful, a great way to start the meal. Main courses: I ordered the Pork Loin with cheese grits, and the sauce that came with it was this surprising Fireball Whiskey gastrique that seriously elevated the whole dish. The Lady got the crab cakes, which were HUGE, and she devoured them. 

Andrew was attentive and even took a picture of all of us, and that really made the night special for me. A group of 7 isn't the easiest to handle sometimes, but he pulled it off with ease. To anyone and everyone: make the drive, I promise it's shorter than you think. Downtown Gastonia absolutely has something to offer, and Webb is an excellent representation of culinary prowess this suburb has."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and everything was great except for the ribs which were cold and dry. I should have sent them back but didn't want to complain. Manager did stop by to make sure everything was great which is a BIG PLUS and rare in Gastonia. Lunch prices spot on! No more expensive than anywhere else and even cheaper than most. BEAUTIFUL DECOR. Great addition to Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Came for a super quick lunch, and the staff was very accommodating.  Rebecca was our waitress and without making us feel rushed, provided our checks promptly so we could leave asap, and even brought to-go drinks.

We both ordered the tuna tacos, which were very tasty.  The truffle fries are also very good.  I left satisfied and very full.

The atmosphere is spectacular.  I would love to come back for a date night!  The old theater gives a very classic look and feel.  Even the bar is pretty to look at.  Very elegant!

I don't live in Gastonia but I would come here often if I did.  I can't imagine many other restaurants in the area would come close to this place."}
{"text":"We started the night with an 8pm reservation. We get there about 15 min early and were immediately seated on the balcony like I requested. Let me say our server Dee Dee was AMAZING! She helped us with everything from drinks to desert. She didnt just suggest , she asked our taste and offered opinions with explanations based on that. We started with the Duck Cigar appetizer which was great. My wife had the Spiced Rubbed Teres  Major and I had the Filet with lobster tails. Both were cooked to perfection and tasted fantastic. We finished with a chocolate mousse cake that was just fitting to a great night!! Also the Blind Squirrel Nut Brown Ale is a great beer. Service was the best Ive had anywhere (thank you DeeDee) , food was great and we loved the new atmosphere of Webbs. We will be back VERY soon!!!"}
{"text":"My last visit to Webb custom kitchen was back on October 12,2017 and it was less than par. We went for my husband's birthday and I had made reservations online via open table. When we walked in, they did not know of my reservation. Anyhow we were seated in the mezzanine and ordered the cheesy bread. I sent the first batch back because it was burnt. This was highly disappointing because this was my husband's first time there and I raved about this bread. The next batch was great. I ordered a salad with salmon and he ordered another plate (I don't remember what).. overall we were less than impressed and have not visited since. It's hit or miss."}
{"text":"Gastonia has for a long time been building a cadre of \"destination\" restaurants that would convince the commuter crowd to drive home to eat here rather than stay in Charlotte for dinners out.  To my mind, Webb Custom Kitchen is the last piece of that puzzle.

The decor is amazing. Set in the old Webb Theatre building, the main dining area still has the high, vaulted ceiling and a movie screen suspended over the open kitchen shows a variety of old movies (without sound).  The brick walls, hardwood floors and comfy seating make for an elegant but not pretentious experience. The bar is well-stocked and creatively constructed, with lighting that seems to make the liquor bottles glow with intoxicating promise. (See what I did there?)

And the food?  Friends and neighbors, this is the good stuff.  Owner Jim Morasso is part of the team that made Epic Chophouse live up to its name in Mooresville, and the Webb menu shows equivalent promise. The \"Angry Lobster\" is worth a try, but my favorite so far is the mozzarella grill (fresh mozz wrapped with prosciutto and grilled, then drizzled with balsamic glaze).  The pork belly app will definitely be my next conquest.

When it comes to steaks, I'm a real snob.  Quite frankly, I can rarely find a steak in a restaurant that's half as good as what I can make at home.  It was a sign of my faith in Jim's vision that I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye ... and my faith was not violated.  This was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever sliced into, topped with perfectly melted Danish bleu cheese.  I even gnawed the bone!  The country potato cakes were a perfect (if a trifle salty) side, and I had to get a sample of the duck fried rice as well, which would make an amazing lunch.

My dining companion ordered the Parma Grana Crusted Breast of Chicken, and while I'm not normally a chicken \"guy\" when I eat out, I would definitely order this for myself sometime ... after I've eaten my way through the rest of the menu.  The shallot, garlic and artichoke cream sauce was a truly original creation that complemented the parma grana crusting perfectly.  I could have eaten her entire plateful!

I was far too full for dessert, but I'll rectify that mistake soon."}
{"text":"Gastonia finest downtown restaurant. It was very good and worth the wait! Just wished they didn't run out of the dreamsicle cheesecake although the chocolate cheesecake was yummy.....I reckon I will have to go back so that I can try it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if you live in Gastonia, are passing through or are here for business like I am, you MUST dine here. I didn't say eat, I said dine!  

The owner Jim is warm and personable. He gave me and my two training team members Sue and Ken a personal tour of the restaurant along with history and an insight to some of the fantastic additions coming soon. His staff is the best, and I mean the best! Attentive, knowledgeable and super nice. 

Now the food. We travel a lot and I live near San Francisco where some of the finest restaurants are located. WCK belongs right there with them. 

The center bone in pork loin chop was melt in your mouth with honey crisp apples sautéed underneath. The best cheese grits I've had on my tour of the south. The greens tasted like my grandmother cooked them and the risotto was smooth flavorful and quite tasty. The appetizer of grilled artichokes was something special as was the variety of in house baked artisan breads. 

The chocolate mouse was the perfect amount of sweet and deep chocolate with a moist cake on the middle. In addition, it was beautiful. 

Now the coffee. And I am a coffee snob, It is a blend made especially for the restaurant. It has the smoothness of espresso with a hint of caramel in the roast. Lovely. 

You have to, need to, must go. 

How often do you get GREAT food, service, atmosphere and architecture/design in one experience.

If I could give it a 10 I would!
Thank you Jim and staff!"}
{"text":"My fiance took me here last night for my birthday. The place was pretty nice. Very unique and interesting. We were seated in the balcony area on a booth which had a pretty good view of the screen and downstairs. I can't remember our waitress's name but she didn't seem/sound all too enthusiastic about her job. After we were seated it also took her a while to come by our table which shouldn't typically take that long. We've gone to plenty of restaurants and it usually doesn't take that long for our waiter/waitress to acknowledge us. She didn't speak loud enough which was annoying to my fiance. The male waiters that helped out and came by our table a few times were even better and we wished that we had one of them instead of her since we were there to celebrate my birthday. It probably would have been a better and more enjoyable experience. I couldn't help but think that if we had gone to a restaurant that we've already gone to that it would've been better. 
For appetizer we got the duck cigars, it wasn't really all that but I guess the sauces did make it better. It's just not something I'd care to order again if I was to come back. I ordered the parmesan crusted breast of chicken and my fiance ordered the king's cut slow roasted prime rib. It wasn't flavorful enough for neither of us. My fiance didn't like that his prime rib was undercooked also. The best part was probably the desserts we got which the male waiter was the one that told us what the restaurant had. I got the chocolate mousse one and my fiance got the black raspberry one. Both were very good. My fiance wants to give it another try someday so I guess we will be coming back to see if our 2nd experience would be better."}
{"text":"Good service and food, but they tend to undercook their steaks.  The bread is extra, but it's a variety of artisan styles, all are very tasty.  Also it's fun to sit in the balcony of this old movie house and reminisce."}
{"text":"The staff, atmosphere and food was great! What a hidden gem! I meant to leave a review after we ate here during restaurant week a few weeks ago. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and the staff said they were about 15 minutes behind so we sat at a table next to the bar. We were greeted by Jim the owner who apologized for the wait (we were fine with waiting a few minutes as it's restaurant week and the ambiance would cause anyone in the right mind to take longer than usual to request their check. 

Once our table was ready the hostess walked us upstairs to the balcony (highly recommended) and though they were busy, they sat my date and I in an oversized booth with one of the best views of the downstairs action, kitchen & movie screen. Our server Taylor, greeted us as if we were her only table. She did not act rushed and though we could see she was busy, she didn't act that way around us. Once we put in our order, the owner Jim came around and asked if we would like a photo so we stood in the middle of balcony as he took a few photos of us. Remember, they are fully packed yet the owner still took time to not just ask us how were were but walked us to the center of the balcony to take a few photos! 

The food arrived and the portions were large and the food was warm and very flavorful. I ordered the steak and crab cakes and wish it was served with a side of Béarnaise sauce or sauce for the crab cakes and steak, though, even without, both items were great. Also, I am not a dessert fan as most times desserts are too sweet, but I ordered the bread pudding to go and shared it with my father (Who is an avid bread pudding fan) the next day. He loved it so much he asked me to go back and order it to go next time I return.

Thank you for taking a risk with your restaurant concept and thank you for creating a memorable experience for all to enjoy in Gastonia! I'm so thankful for trying this place during restaurant week and can't wait to surprise friends and family when they request to go out for dinner! The staff was warm, food was great, ambiance was stunning and the overall experience was amazing!

Thank you once more!"}
{"text":"We were in town to sell our car and thought we would stop and have lunch as well!!

The inside is super cute and used to be an old movie theater!! Our server told us that they still show old black and white movies on certain nights. 

For starters we ordered duck cigars which were like a duck egg roll and they were amazing! For my entree I ordered a crab cake sandwhich and it was amazing as well!  I will say I think we were a tad bit underdressed but either way the food was great!

I do have a suggestion! There was no changing table in the ladies room so I ended up changing my newborn on the booth bench seat. Now I don't mind doing that but I think most places should have somewhere for mommas to change their children and not in the middle of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Wowwww!!!! My husband and I had an amazing evening! The ambiance was fantastic, our waiter (Rob) was phenomenal, and our food was out of this world. My husband ordered the cheese bread bc I told him it was a popular choice. Honestly, I wasn't excited about it until my first bite- crunchy, gooey, creamy, cheesy goodness! It's definitely not what I think of when I hear cheese bread, but oh soooo much better. We split a house salad with dressings on the side bc we couldn't decide if we should go traditional (ranch) or out of the box (orange saffron); we could've happily ended our meal right there as it was filling and delicious, but we pressed on with our entrees. I got the parmesan crusted chicken with potato cakes and my husband got the tenderloin medallion unwrapped Wellington with asparagus and smashed potatoes. Both were cooked to perfection and utterly delicious. We knew we wanted dessert bc of others' reviews, and still, it was so hard to stop eating bc every bite was spectacular. We finally asked our server to wrap up the leftovers bc we knew we'd just keep on going if left to our own devices. We decided on the pineapple cheesecake and the reviews were spot on- worth making space for after an already over-filling meal! We will definitely be back- what a hidden gem in downtown Gastonia!"}

{"text":"If you're in the Charlotte metro area, take a short drive to enjoy this gem. Had dinner here with my wife and some friends. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the atmosphere was just plain cool. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience in this unique setting.  Arrived early and had the opportunity to learn about the history of the building.  It has been renovated to enhance the architecture of the original structure.  Our waiter, Ryan, shared many points of interest and made knowledgeable recommendations from the menu.  He described the crab cakes perfectly. They were the best I've ever eaten -- very light crust and mostly crab without all the binding mix of most crab cakes.  All of the staff was friendly and eager to accommodate our needs.  Relaxed atmosphere for an excellent dinner experience.  Ryan, DeeDee, and Aaron made us feel welcome and eager to return."}
{"text":"Returned to Webb Custom Kitchen this week - my excuse - a friend visiting from Cincinnati. We both thoroughly enjoyed the food and the ambiance. This is an outstanding restaurant and we're so lucky that it's here in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant! We have never ordered anything bad here. The cheese bread, the artisan bread and the lobster appetizers are all amazing. My favorite dishes are the crab cakes and the airline chicken. All the sides are wonderful as well. The service is always great and the owners are always present and speak to each table personally. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wonderful.  Good service, absolutely beautiful atmosphere and great food.  I got salmon which was perfectly cooked as I requested and the little touches such as the crispy fennel on top was awesome.  I come to this area often for business and will definitely return.  Also is a great spot for a business dinner."}
{"text":"Funky bit upscale atmosphere, reasonable prices, FANTASTIC cocktails, delightful food and rock solid service make this a gem off the beaten path."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last Saturday night and we really enjoyed ourselves. We sat in the balcony and everything was beautiful. I wish we asked for a booth up there but instead we sat at a two person table, the chairs were a little hard but it was fine...next time we'll ask for something else. He ordered the standard hardware burger and really liked it, and I had the prime rib and it was good. We're thinking it's going to be a great place to bring friends and family in the future. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and so is the food. Don't leave without trying the pineapple upside down cheesecake/cake!"}
{"text":"Of course I'm still giving this place five stars. I've never left WCK and thought it could have been any more perfect. My father took myself and my mother out to celebrate Mother's Day to Webb after seeing the fantastic brunch menu they posted online. We had reservations for 10:30am but I think most of everyone was going later so we probably would have been seated if we hadn't had one. We got to sit in the balcony area which is always my favorite. I love watching the kitchen area below and seeing everyone prepare the food. My mother put it best last time we visited: \"That is a well-oiled machine.\"

Our waitress was very friendly informing us of the specials for the day and taking our drink orders. We all ordered a bloody mary and it was fantastic. The manager came by a little after checking on us and told us more about the drinks we ordered. They used this new pepper vodka from Charleston that's really smooth but also had a bit of a kick to it. It was fantastic.

I ordered the steak and eggs with chimichurri sauce that definitely complimented the entire meal. The steak was cooked perfectly. The entire meal was so fantastic there was no way I was going to leave any food behind. My mom ordered the eggs florentine with focaccia. I made sure to steal a bite and it was fantastic too. Everyone at our table was completely happy with our meals.

If you live in Cleveland or Gaston County and want to go somewhere nice and don't want to drive to Charlotte, this is the place. This is my favorite restaurant in the area above all and I wouldn't go anywhere else if I want to have great food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great ambience and Gustavo was the perfect host! He had great menu suggestions and was very attentive. This was our first visit and definitely not our last. We had planned a night at Lily's Italian Bistro, unfortunately we sat there for 15 minutes without even a hello from 2 separate servers. Webb was on our list to try and from the moment we entered, we were warmly greeted by several of the staff. This restaurant is in the old theater, so not only are there old films running on the big screen but several songs from different soundtracks that take you on an eclectic journey from Casablanca, to Grease to the Lost Boys.  Thank you for such a great time. We will see you again very soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I we were looking for a nice evening out in the Gastonia area. We tried this place because of the Yelp rating and it seemed like a nice place for a quiet, fine dinner. 
    The venue is very unique-- a 1920's movie theater turned restaurant. Service was great, and the food was very tasty. I had filet medallions and my wife had the salmon. Both dishes had creative sides that were full of flavor. The blackberry cheese cake dessert was terrific as well. 
     We live an hour away (in CLT), but wouldn't hesitate to make the trip again for a special occasion. I don't give many 5 stars, but this was a nice surprise.
    BTW-- We met the owner and he has another restaurant, Epic, in Mooresville, NC."}
{"text":"This place opened this week and it has so much going for it. It has great ambiance, great wait staff and solid food.

For a finer Gastonia establishment this place has it all. I got a Dark and Stormy from the bar (their name: Old Man and the Sea) and it was prepared well. The wait staff were all very polite and prompt. 

I got the vinaigrette chicken and it was absolutely fantastic. The combination of the chicken, vinaigrette and tomatoes left nothing to be wanted. Exceeded every expectation. Their fries were extremely good. 

Definitely recommend this place. I hope they can continue to be consistent and become an upscale staple in Gastonia."}
