{"text":"We live in Whitby and are SO glad to see some decent restaurants popping up. One of our new favourites is Marca. We've enjoyed their food a few times now and plan to go back again for sure.  Some of our favourites have been - spaghetti and meatballs (we think they're excellent), their Caesar salad is perfect, fantastic chicken Parmesan, and we enjoyed a special one night of seared sea scallops.  Make a reservation on the weekend, it gets busy, or enjoy takeout.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We recently brought a large group (hockey team) to the restaurant. We arranged a menu ahead of time with Vince and the Chef. These events can be nightmares. Ours went off without a hitch. Great atmosphere in the restaurant.  The smell of garlic and other wonderful aromas was so pleasing.  The Staff were so nice, accomodating and efficient and I cant say enough about about well we were treated. 
Kids had a large slice of Marguerita pizza, order of spaghetti with meatballs and salad. No complaints from any of them. 
Adults all had chicken Parm or Veal parm choice due to our time limitations. All were excellent. Ceasar salad was great. Only minor complaint was the bread. A little on the dry side for my liking.  Dipped in Oil and Balsalmic vinegar made it fine. 
Some had some dessert, Tirimusu which according to my dessert afficondo husband, was excellent. 
Hats off to Vince, Chef and the Staff. 
We had an excellent meal. Got out in time for our next game as promised. 
If back in Whitby, we will eat here for sure."}
{"text":"We have been frequent  patrons of this restaurant since it open. It was one of our favorite spots, could always be guaranteed a fantastic meal, unfortunately all good things must come to an end. They have recently changed their chef and not for the better. All four appetizers and entrees were extremely disappointing. Judging by the very few patrons on a usually reservation only evening showed that our feelings were obviously shared by others.

I do hope they read their current reviews and react as I will be sorry to say I will not be back unless they do."}
{"text":"We went to Marca a couple weeks ago on a Saturday night around 6pm. Walked in. Asked for a table, when we didn't have a reservation, the server/hostess just shrugged her shoulders and said they had nothing. This is just such bad service, I mean no table the whole night? No offer to seat us in an hour? No spot at the bar? It really was ridiculous. Anyway. That left a sour taste in my mouth, despite that, we tried again. 

This time it was a Thursday night. A few tables in the restaurant.  The experience was really just mediocre. I would love to love this place, as the decor is cool and casual, and it would be great to have a truly amazing go-to for Italian in Whitby.

The service was fine. Nothing exceptional, and a few little things but generally fine. 

I think the biggest issue is feeling like it's poor value for money. I'm all for spending bucks when the food is fabulous, but Marca just falls short. 

Caesar Salad. Good. Nothing to write about. Pretty salty if that is something that concerns you. 

Vittello alla Parmigiana . This seemed like a generous portion, however it was cutlet, cut paper thin and  heavily breaded. This came with pasta. It all had way too much sauce. For $24, it's overpriced 

Margherita Pizza. This was also ok. Nice flavour on the crust. No wood fire. Underdone + Too much + Soggy. Again, when you can get a Real Margherita at somewhere like Libretto for the same price, it makes me feel ripped off. 

The total was about $70 w/o tip. In my opinion, I would just love to come to a place like this if they stepped up the food, and made the pricing more reasonable.

On another note, a couple we know came here once... said the Calamari was basically inedible to the server, and then the chef came out and told them it was perfect and that they didn't know what they were talking about. It's just so uncouth.  For that reason, they will never return, and I can't say I blame them."}
{"text":"We have frequented this place since it opened. Their pizzas are fantastic. Menu items are freshly prepared and well presented. Service is prompt and courteous. Great place for a date or gathering with friends. Wine list has many wines not available at the LCBO and are matched well to the cuisine."}
{"text":"Well all I can say this is the closest thing to an authentic Italian that I have had outside of NYC and Italy. The family run feeling of the place with down home Italian food just makes the perfect. If you live in Durham come here.  You must try the meatballs!!! My son and I loved them."}
{"text":"How did a great downtown Toronto Italian Trattoria find it's way to this quaint little neighbourhood out in the East side of the city?  

The amazing, friendly service here was only complimented by the great food that followed throughout the night.  The Salumi and Cheese sampling was a tasty way to start the evening and the maitre d's suggestion of dipping cheese into the honey pot on the charcuterie board was the smartest thing I've ever heard.  

The Caprese Salad was a sweet reminder that the warmer weather is on it's way.  The sweet basil and olive oil/balsamic vinegar dressing was a perfect combination and a great way to cleanse the palette.  

Later on, the Veal Oscar special, served with my own personal recommendation of replacing the potato/veg combination with the Ricotta Gnocchi was, how you say, yummy!

Hopefully the sampling of the, yet to be determined, ice cream selections to the dessert menu will make the cut.  Seeing as the summer months are coming and what better way to celebrate that with a scoop of delicious vanilla and cookie mix ice cream  made the end of the meal an enjoyable finale.  Top it off with an espresso that will rival any mass chain outlet and you've got the perfect night on the (small) town of Whitby!

Other reasons to try this place out:  great price/portion combinations, a select wine list that doesn't break the bank, great ambiance, attentive staff, fun downtown Toronto atmosphere and lovely, quaint decor from the crystal chandeliers to the wall art of famous Italian personalities.  Marca Trattoria is enough to make this Big City Boy run to the country for a taste of good Italian family-owned cuisine!  Make the trip, it's worth it.  

Tip:  make a reservation if you're going on the weekend!  We didn't, but timing was perfect for when we arrived!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch. The salad was fresh and tasted good, though it came cold. I had a daily  special; ravioli stuffed with braised beef in a creamy mushroom sauce. The ravioli was delicious. The sauce was  rich and creamy, with the flavours from the mushrooms bring it all together. Service was friendly and attentive."}
