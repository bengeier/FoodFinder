{"text":"What an absolute waste of space. The staff doesn't even understand their own menu. I've been eating middle eastern food for decades, and I usually love it. They don't even know how to serve hummus - a container full of greasy, deep-fried pita chips, rather than bread. Unbelievable. This place is a total disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a small little place. They have mujadara, which I like. They have an appetizer platter that is very good. The hummus comes without tahini flavoring, but sauces are sold. Prices are very reasonable. They take credit cards."}
{"text":"First time trying the restaurant under the new ownership. Food was very good - everyone had compliments for their particular dish (and we had quite a selection). The portions were generous for the price. Only complaint was the French fries - but really, who orders French fries from a middle eastern restaurant? Quick service, too. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The beef Schwarma is the way to go! Customer service was great. I got my food quick and made to order."}
{"text":"I wanted the food to be delicious but sadly it wasn't. I believe it was called something else so, I'm not sure if it's under new management. I got the falafel wrap which was OK but greasy. We ordered the hummus appetizer and my husband had to ask for pita bread since it wasn't offered up originally. they didn't give enough bread for the amount of hummus. The hummus had no flavor. I'm not sure what my husband got but, his was greasier than mine wrap."}
{"text":"The only reason for 1 star is that the restaurant was walking distance to the Hospital.  While only 3 reviews posted prior to our visit, we should have taken the advice and gone somewhere else for some takeout.  The long black knotted hair that was in the salad...which we didn't see until my wife was pulling it out of her mouth is all that really needs to be said. The order wasn't correct even after pointing at the 3 things on the menu we wanted.   Also, the prices have been increased from the pix of the menu that is posted. Now there are 4 reviews...take heed."}
