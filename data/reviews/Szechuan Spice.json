{"text":"The food is really good ! It is hard to find the fresh authentic Chinese food in Shadyside, now we finally have one there, especially  if you like the spicy food. We ordered fish fillet in hot broth and Diced Chicken with Dried Peppers Chongqing-Style. They both are very tasty. And the place is huge, very comfortable. My new favor spot!"}
{"text":"Literally best Chinese food I've ever had. Excellent service. Fantastic people. They have such a huge variety of food it was hard to choose but everything was just so delicious."}
{"text":"I tried this with a friend, eager to compare it to the other Szechuan restaurants in the East End.  Aside from the fact that our server was new and hardly knew the menu, our overall experience was average.  We couldn't figure out how to order what the other tables had (hopelessly American we are) and our server was not of help.  We had an amazing appetizer of cold noodles with a spicy sauce, but our main dishes were only meh.  The taste was nothing special.  I might give this place another shot, and hopefully get a more knowledgable server.  As of now, I *much* prefer Chengdu or Sichuan House."}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan food - big portions, great price!   We ordered dry fish item (E9), pork belly with taro, fried peppers, fried rice - everything was super Was expecting a big bill - ended up being a third less than what we had in mind. Staff is friendly and efficient. Will visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"Impressively fantastic food. I think the waiter was a bit new and almost seemed apologetic and worried we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. There's not much \"American Chinese\" food here and that's why I love it. Everything we ordered was fantastic and very unlike anything I've had. Will definitely come back next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"The delivery was fast but the food didnt have the quality that we expected and it was very oily. The portions were really big though."}
{"text":"????? ?????? ???? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? The food is really tasty, atmosphere is nice. It's probably the largest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Overall this place is not bad.  ????????????????? The reason why I rated 1 Star is because the service attitude.  ???????????? ??????? ????9:34???????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????????????? We arrived at 8:30pm and we know the restaurant closed at 9:30pm. So we ate fast because we didn't want to delay the time of close. We finished at 9:34pm and we were about to leave. However the waitress kept checking if we were done and kept taking empty plates away one by one while we were still eating. That's really annoying.  ??????????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? I understand that she wants to get off work on time, but in other restaurants in Pitt, even we go in 10 mins before they close, the waitress will still serve us patiently, rather than keep checking on us and keep taking empty plates away often. I mean you could tell we were leaving in a few minutes, u just can't wait for 3 mins?  ????????20%  ???????????? ???????????? We still left 20% tip, but personally I will not come back to this place again.  The food is tasty and atmosphere is great, just dine in here early in a day rather than right before they close. XD"}
{"text":"Get ready for something out of the ordinary because this is not your standard Hakka restaurant. Fresh, flavourful and fiery Szechuan / Hakka style food. Their unique and closely guarded family secret recipes are palpable in each of their expertly prepared dishes. Been back several times since they opened and have tried quite a number of their items. There are so many addictive dishes that it is tough to narrow it down.  The following are highly recommended. Soup: Chicken Corn Soup / Hot and Sour Soup Appetizers: Crispy Chicken Wings / Veg Spring Roll (dip in their house made chilli oil) Mains: Spicy Peanut Chicken, Crispy Ginger Chicken, Dry Saut√©ed Szechuan Shredded Beef, Sizzling Sliced Beef with Scallion, Chilli Shrimps.  Lunch prices are also hard to beat, $7.99 for a combo: soup, main dish and rice.  This is truly an exceptional hidden gem which will not remain secret for long!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place and it was terrible. I got the general chicken all white meat with a salad. The chicken was dry and stale. It tasted like it has been sitting around all day. It was not fresh. The salad was just iceberg lettuce and 2 cherry tomatoes. The lettuce had a disgusting taste. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"First visit.  Table is dirty (see picture) and they seated me, but didn't assign a server.  Hoping food makes my visit worth it.  Prices seem reasonable on the lunch menu. Update: Never given water. Order finally taken, but wrong drink brought out.  I assume this isn't normal and hope your visit is better.  As for me, I left so can't speak to the food."}
{"text":"Loved the food here. Feels like home . It's not the fusion Chinese type . I can say it quite authentic!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"As a college student in a budget, I have to say this is one of my favorites. I can get authentic Chinese/Szechuan at a very low price. I've had many Szechuan restaurants in Pittsburgh, and I have to say that this one is definitely the best in terms of taste, price, and proportion!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here last night, it was the first time I ever had food from Szechuan Spice. I got pork dumplings, vegetable spring rolls and rice. It was all delicious and cooked perfectly. The prices were a little high but it is definitely worth it, I would eat here again for sure. The delivery came quickly as well."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese in the city! Completely bland, tasted funny, and the potstickers weren't fully cooked - still pink inside. The hot and sour soup was pretty good, but I guess even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes. I ordered delivery (UE), so it didn't help that it was cold, and came without utensils or condiments (Makes it hard to eat!)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night.   Pros: - Reservations  - Decently priced  - Servers were polite and professional  - Both small crab corn $3.50 and small chicken corn $2.95 soups were excellent   Cons: - Some items were a little bland. - Tea is not complementary like in other places."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Great place to take friends to. Not bad service. Mapo Toufu and dishes with fish recommended."}
{"text":"This new joint in Shadyside is definitely one to check out! They have a full authentic Chinese menu as well as an American Chinese menu and sushi! It was so fresh and flavorful and the service was very quick and extremely friendly.  I'm updating my review because now that I love this place so much I can't stay away, I've tried many more things.   I'm a HUGE fan of the 1/2 off sushi on Wednesday night deal! My typical order is edamame and a roll of choice (I love their rainbow roll and anything with the word tempura - obviously.)  The sesame chicken is as consistent as ever and is always ordered by my companion.   Service is immensely friendly and quick. Please give this place some love, they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Solid!! Only had Gen So and an egg roll but it really good, and fairly priced.  This is my new 'goto' for Chinese take out.   It's the old Jimmy Wans location. Looks a lot nicer inside too, even though I did stay.   Big menu.  All the bells and whistles."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Sichuan food so we definitely had to try this place out when we moved it. The staff was friendly and attentive. We ordered the beef tendon appetizer, double cooked sliced pork belly and the fish fillet in spicy broth. The food arrived timely and portions were generous and tasted as you would expect from a Sichuan restaurant. The fish however stole the show since I could tell the fish were freshly filleted as opposed to the commercial fillets a lot of other places use. If I had to make one critique, it's not as spicy as many Sichuan places which didn't bother me since I like food spicy or mild. If you're looking for a kick though you might need to ask them to make it spicier."}
{"text":"I have been craving Asian food all week and I will be honest... their home-style beef noodle soup hit the spot. I took the drove over, the service was nice. They were super sweet and welcoming despite getting takeout! I will definitely be here more often and I cannot wait to try more of their dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place because the previous restaurant at this location was good.  I was sorely disappointed.  All 3 dishes I ordered -- Dan Dan noodles, mapo tofu with fish filet, and twice cooked pork in black bean sauce -- were so heavily salted that they were inedible.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So good, had crispy ginger chicken / beef, and the dry shredded beef  Cannot recommend enough, quickly to become my go to restaurant  Try it out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"truly amazing food. friendly service both take out and dine-in. love this place and always come here to curb my chinese cravings"}
{"text":"So far, I think this is probably one of the better Chinese restaurant that delivers to us. They offer both American Chinese, authentic Chinese and sushi. We got geo chicken and shredded pork in garlic sauce. The geo chicken tasted really good but it could be more crispier, part of it I think is because it was delivery. The shredded pork was 6.5/10 authentic. It was not like some other place claim they have the authentic Szechuan dish but it was really not. This one it has most of the ingredients that the dish would have if it is in China. It tasted a little bit too salty. There are defiantly some improvements can be done but I'm pretty happy with the order. Look order again to try some other dishes they have. One more tip for ordering, make sure mention that you want the meal cooked in authentic Chinese style or American style. I think there are some dishes that can be cooked in both ways."}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious. Great atmosphere and quick service. Attentive to detail. Really fresh and never disappointing!"}
{"text":"Cesspool alert. I should have known when I tried to pick up my napkin and it was stuck to the table. The place is filthy, disgusting. The food was very bad both the ginger beef and chilli chicken... cartilage and fat throughout the chicken, msg laden broth. Asked for water and they straight out turned on the sink and filled a pitcher with luke warm water... wtf.. then I get a cream soda and it's warm as well even though it was in the fridge.....  .1 stars"}
{"text":"Water spinach 5/5 Fish fillet in silk tofu 4/5 tofu so soft Steamed pork with taro 5/5 The interior is not the best and the price is not cheap, but the food tastes really good. The portion is big too."}
{"text":"Is it just me or did it take forever for this place to finally get off the ground.  How many years was it that this place sat in a state of suspended readiness?  Finally, it opened it's doors and ran with it.  The good thing about working in Oakland means that you have a multitude of places to order your lunch from.  Working with people that seem to live off of Chinese food, you always have the best restaurants' menus available.    I was in the mood for some good vegetable chow down.  Looking over the 'Vegetables' section I honed in on a potato based plate.  I went with Sauteed Shredded Potatoes.  When you select this you have three choices of sauce: hot pepper, spicy sauce, or vinegar (not spicy).  Looking at that list, if you are like me, you would think that meant the the spice level was in descending order.  That would be why I went with spicy sauce.  My god, was I ever wrong, I should have went with vinegar.  I don't mind some good spicy food, but that's when I could enjoy it.  This had a spice to it that made me cry, and not with joy.  That's not to take away from the overall plate, it was a good taste and cooked amazingly.  It's just I was paying for this meal well into the morning, if you know what I mean.  I think at one point I even opened the fridge and pulled out some pesto to cool this down a bit.  Even though the spice level was burning my eyebrows off, I still went at this.  Sweat coming out of every pore, nose like a faucet and an uncomfortable feeling of what lay ahead.  Would I get this dish again, yes, but the vinegar sauce would be my answer to this.  Why not five stars?  The price.  Some of the prices were down right outrageous.  For the price here you could possibly get two meals elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delivery is fast and the food is hot and good. Last time they forgot the bubble tea I ordered and this time they forgot the rice."}
{"text":"great new restaurant!  ordered out through yelp delivery and it was much faster than anticipated.  Hard to find good authentic chinese food in the burgh, and pleasantly surprised.  Haven't eaten there yet but expect the same authenticity!"}
{"text":"Cheese creations. It's comfort food and good quality ingredients all served up in a warm gooey dish. Some tasty local craft beers are available in the fridge too, making this a go-to spot for some indulgent cravings. Great work Chef Boris! ,Thanks I'll come again"}
{"text":"This is the same restaurant as what used to be at Dundas and Chestnut downtown! This restaurant has the kindest staff and the best hot and sour soup I've ever had in Toronto. My favourite dish is the spicy peanut beef. I crave it weekly! I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Szechuan food and they deliver too! I've had the pork with sweet flour paste a number of times when I wanted one dish that was flavorful and not really spicy. Another really good one in the same vein is pork with sweet chestnuts. Delicious spicy dishes include both diced chicken with dried pepper Chongqing style (chicken is fried with a crispy coating) and diced chicken with dried pepper Chengdu style. The shrimp with leek dumplings have a gossamer like dumpling skin with tasty shrimp and leek filling, not uncommon in China but fairly uncommon here in Pittsburgh. The diced rabbit with red chili sauce tastes good but for most Westerners eating the meat around the bone might seem a little too much effort but the flavor is there. All this and very nice staff, prompt delivery, a winner in the Pittsburgh Szechuan sweepstakes. Try them soon!"}
{"text":"Would never order from here again. My husband and I ordered takeout, the person on the phone had no customer service skills at all, and the same when i went in to pick up the food. Then I got home and the food was even worse. The rice was like paste, we got the wrong soup with one combo, the fried wontons were burnt and inedible, the spring rolls were so under cooked they were cold and mush on the inside, and the vegetables in my dish were also not cooked. There was no soy sauce, plum sauce, or even napkins in the bag."}
{"text":"Awful. Two stars for being a clean asian restaurant in the city which is seemingly impossible to find these days. Filled with msg, tasted like old fryer oil, and chewy crappy chicken."}
{"text":"Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper Chongqing Style.  These are the words that changed my life forever.  I can't stop thinking about it. The flavors and the burning mouth and the herbal flavor of Szechuan peppercorns.   This is the ultimate dish."}
{"text":"Great food packed full of flavors, especially when you can eat spicy food. I highly recommend the black pepper chicken and dried chicken chongqing style. Surprisingly quite fresh and tasty sushi, too. The only reason for docking 1 star is the slightly higher price point."}
{"text":"We came as a couple on a Monday night, it was quiet. Service was courteous and prompt - all of them greeted us with a smile. Our waiter also went the extra mile whenever he served us, for example, by bringing out extra plates for sharing when we only asked for bowls.  The restaurant is spacious and layout is well thought out. Because there is so much space, the tables are placed quite far apart from each other which allowed us a quiet and comfortable meal in our own spot. This in itself was a big part of our enjoyable experience here tonight.  We ordered a pot of chinese tea and 2 szechuan dishes. The pot of chinese tea definitely added to the authenticity of dining here.  1) Flaming chicken wings on hot dish Served on a small flame that kept it warm throughout, portions were generous with mushrooms, cauliflower and celery.  2) Braised pork intestine noodle soup We really enjoyed everything about this dish - noodles, soup and intestines. The intestines were the big ones. The soup had just the right amount of spice and flavouring without drowning each other out. The noodles were similar like udon / lo mien style noodles.  Dinner for 2 people came came out to $27.00, fairly cheap for such a decent meal. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It gets the job done as far as a Chinese food joint goes. Pros: it's not bad. Cons: it's not mind blowing. For the appetizers we got the scallion pancakes and the hot and sour soup: both very lack luster. For entrees we got the general tso's chicken and the mapo tofu: both pretty decent. We also ordered a mango and a strawberry bubble drink: nothing special here, kinda tasted like it was straight from the powder packets. Would I return? Sure, if I was in the mood for mediocre Chinese food and if I was too lazy to drive to the better Chinese restaurants in squirrel hill."}
{"text":"We found out about this place on accident and have been ordering from there on a weekly basis ever since. Huge quantity for the great price and the food is always fresh and delicious. We have only ordered takeout and have not eaten in the restaurant yet but the place is really nice inside. The staff is always very friendly as well, and the orders are ready in no time at all. So happy to have this gem in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"The food has always been good.  But cleanliness of the place is deteriorating.  The washrooms are filthy at least the men's. There was no soap, no paper towels and the sink looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months.  For an Asian restaurant, how do you run out of chopsticks for take out orders?"}
{"text":"The lunch specials (which are available on Saturdays!) are a steal. Huge portions of Chongqing dry-fried chicken, green beans with minced pork, mapo tofu. The only dish that missed the mark were the dandan noodles - we felt that it needed just a touch of sourness or vinegar to cut through the sesame paste."}
{"text":"We came to enjoy a mix of Chinese food and half-off sushi specials!   Everything was good. Nothing was amazing but it was all very solid and I'll be back. Note that sushi is not half off the entire menu, but there's a select Wednesday menu (shown in photos).  Overall, a great addition to Shadyside!"}
{"text":"This place is the Chinese food equivalent of Stanley from The Office. Slow, rude and worthless."}
{"text":"Ordered Uber Eats tonight from here and it was surprisingly very good. I got the Spicy Tuna roll, Alaska roll, and Beef noodle soup. The soup arrived extra hot even though the restaurant is like 20 mins from me! That was a huge plus. The sushi was very fresh but could have had a bit more rice. I don't like a ton of rice but a little more would have been good. The beef soup was really good.   Also they packaged the noodles separate which was much appreciated so that they didn't get too soggy.   Would def order again or make a trip to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dinner here on a cold snowy night warmed my soul. Our waiter was young, 3 days on the job, but also very good. We started with really good hot and sour soup. Followed with a whole crispy fish that was off the charts great. We then had string beans. Followed by an extremely spicy dry chicken and pepper . So flavorful and yummy. Ended with Mooshoo Pork. A feast and the price was right all for under $80. Only complaint was tea was made with Lipton Green tea bags- they should serve authentic tea. Great food, great caring service and we dined on a large round table with a lazy Susan to spin the feast. The is in the former Jimmy Tsang on Center. One more quality Chinese restaurant - too many to choose."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Asian food that I have had in a long time I will continue to go back the atmosphere is awesome and the food is just damn delicious"}
{"text":"** Authentic Chinese food with sushi deals on Wednesdays. Very spacious and not very crowded so it's a good place to hangout with larger groups and have conversations.  I discovered this place from my girlfriend, who saw several ads and also frequently shops at Geagle and Aldi nearby. Needless to say we've been here several times and it's been solid every time. They have half off sushi on Wednesday, which I think tastes decently fresh (the unagi)  Typically we ordered the broiled fish as well as the pea shoots. Both are tasty and authentic - however the broiled fish sometimes has a bit too much mala numbing spice, making our lips very tingly and sometimes just a bit overwhelming, so we ask for less spice. The veggies are also a bit on the oilier side.   It's never been crowded and the place is very spacious, which I like since I never feel packed or disturbed by a lot of noise. Definitely give this place a shot if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I am from Sichuan (Szechuan), and I endorse for the food here. The decoration of the restaurant may not be very fancy, but the price and flavor for the food are top notch. We ordered spicy fish filet and Chengdu style pork belly. Both are very good. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really fast delivery and great food! I ordered the Dan dan noodles, wonton in spicy oil, and hot and sour fish soup. The fish soup was so delicious and exactly what I needed on a cold night! The dan dan noodles was also great, but was a little oily. Definitely need to try this place again because of fast delivery and great authentic food!"}
{"text":"Brought a Groupon to this place. Service was nice, food was decent and portion size was good. It is located in the plaza right beside the National Sports."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, fresh ingredients. I ordered lemon chicken and chicken with vegetables, along with wonton soup. Lemon chicken had way too much vinegar, my eyes were watering even from the smell and it burned my lips. I scraped off as much of the lemon sauce as I could since the chicken itself was really good. I was pleasantly surprised they used chicken breast. Vegetables in the other dish were fresh and crunchy. Wonton soup was very good, it earned the 4th star. The staff are really friendly and efficient. Restaurant itself is brand new and therefore very clean. Decor could be better, it's too generic looking."}
{"text":"OVERALL: decent Chinese food with slightly expensive prices. I would be okay with coming here again - however, there are better options elsewhere in Pittsburgh for Sichuan food.   I lived in Sichuan for the first few years of my life, and love spicy food. I was delighted to find another Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh, so I went here with a group of friends to check it out. We ordered a bunch of traditional Chinese dishes, such as Chongqing spicy chicken, Mao's pork belly, dandan noodles, shredded pork with beancurd, watercress, and shui zhu niu (???).   The taste of the food was a solid 3.5/5. It's  authentic for the most part, albeit a tad too sweet for me. I would give it a 4 because I liked the experience, but unfortunately I had to dock a point, because for every single dish I ordered, I could name a different restaurant in Pittsburgh that cooks it better. Not to say that the food was bad - I definitely enjoyed it - but there are better options out there. The dishes I enjoyed the most were the shui zhu niu and chongqing spicy chicken. However, the dandan noodles were cooked in a very strange way, and the watercress was not fresh. I would stay away from those dishes in the future."}
{"text":"I finally was able to stop by and try Szechuan Spice, and after multiple years of living directly over it in the past, this was a long time coming.  If I can give you only one tip with this restaurant, it is this -- Go. On. Wednesday. There is a half price sushi menu and it is excellent. After a meal of 2 specialty sushi rolls, one spicy tuna roll, two pieces of salmon sushi, a pork egg roll, and dessert, the bill was $28. Not too shabby.  I ordered the spicy girl roll which was absolutely perfect. It was spicy, but just a bit, and that was cooled off by the avocado. I really enjoyed how the whole roll was wrapped with imitation crab on the outside; it had a surprising texture and added a sweet note. (yes, most sushi uses imitation crab, don't gasp, deep down you knew that and it is delicious so don't judge).   The salmon sushi was of very good quality; the two rolls ordered by my companion (the rainbow roll and spicy tuna) were also yummy. Very fresh overall! But the most interesting and one of the most surprising parts of the meal was the red bean ice cream. I've never had red bean ice cream before, and it was actually quite good. For some reason it reminded me of stracciatella due to the texture and flavor.  The service was friendly and quick for fresh sushi. I'll have to stop by another time to try all if the different items offered on the menu, but it'll be hard to tear me away from the Wednesday special."}
{"text":"yes. yes. yes. Have you had Mao Pow Tofu? if not... your missing out. Place is large and bright... with what seems to be allot of options. I had take-out. I brought my own containers (trying to not use plastic/ zero-waste) They were open and friendly about it. I order Mao Pow Tofu and Chinese Broccoli. Wow. I grew up in San Fransisco and this is THE REAL DEAL. I requested vegan/ no fish oil/meat and they were also wonderful about that. Im going to plan a vegan dinner here. Such a great spot. Looking forward to going in for lunch specials soon. Yay real Szechuan Vegan food!"}
{"text":"Mistakes happen; it's what you do about them that really makes an impression. I've ordered from this place at least 3 times, alternating takeout and delivery. Tonight, my taro bubble tea was missing from my delivered order. I called the driver, thinking it might be in his car, but it was not, and he told me he'd clear it up with the restaurant himself (wow!). No more than 10 minutes later, my phone rings, and it's the driver outside with my bubble tea, made exactly to my specifications. I didn't know it was possible to be impressed with delivery service, but these guys are wicked fast (tonight's dinner was delivered a mere 25 minutes after we ordered) and very courteous.  The food--a perfect compromise for my szechuan cravings and my husband's \"mall Chinese food\" cravings. I get their version of mabo dofu, he gets something fried in a sticky sauce, and we share a Chinese takeout staple: green beans with a generous topping of ground pork. Other favorites include their steamed dumplings and the chopped chicken. The only thing we haven't loved was the dan dan--a little too sesame-y for our tastes (almost tasted peanut-y). And I'll throw down some fighting words--I think their mabo dofu is better than Chengdu and Sichuan Gourmet's.  Super fast tasty food, and they actually read your comments about customizations...what more could you want in a delivery place?"}
{"text":"I remember when this restaurant was Jim Tsangs's many years ago.  For those who also remember how good that food was, you will not be disappointed in Szechuan Spice.  The food is fresh and the flavor is excellent.  I ordered two avocado rolls, which were huge, with perfect avocado texture, and tasty Nori.     The pad Thai had delicious, fresh vegetables.  My husband got Szechuan beef, which he described as both salty and spicy with tender beef, fresh vegetables.  He also described the egg rolls as perfectly cooked , not oily, with a variety of vegetables.  I would recommend this his to anyone in the Shadyside area."}
{"text":"My go to place for when I'm craving Szechuan. I was incredibly impressed by how quickly I had my food delivered, and how delicious the food tasted. I absolutely love their diced chicken with dried pepper, chongqing style. If you've never had Szechuan peppercorns, this is a great way to experience their unique flavor and heat."}
{"text":"There was a place in the late 70s - mid 80s in Indianapolis on Michigan Road near the old Target that made the most amazing chicken fried rice. I grew up eating their food and I was so sad when that part of town dried up and blew away.   And now? I feel like I'm eating their food again. Best. Chicken. Fried. Rice. Ever. I almost wept as I shoveled it into my mouth. I also like their scallion pancakes. That's all I've ordered via Postmates but I really should visit their restaurant.   For management - Please take a look at the notes customers add to their Postmates, etc. orders. I would kill to add cashews to the fried rice for my next order.   And thank you! Good Chinese food is so hard to find."}
{"text":"VERY tasty food! The service was fast and extremely friendly. We ordered a variety of appetizers from the Chinese & Dim Sum menus, rather than single entees, and were pleased across the board. The atmosphere is light and appealing, and just a little campy.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Szechuan Spice!"}
{"text":"Awesome Hakka food. Had Chili chicken, crispy beef and Manchurian Noodles. Super fast delivery as well. This is our new Hakka place."}
{"text":"RUDE PEOPLE. BAD SERVICE! Do not order unless you want to wait for your unsavory cold food for over an hour an a half!"}
{"text":"Might be my new favorite Szechuan restaurant in town! I've been here several times, both for dine in and take out. I've had better experiences with the food for dine in, but it's still always been delicious! My favorite dishes so far have been the mapo tofu with fish filet (huge portions and spicier than most mapo tofu I've had in Pittsburgh) and the bok choy with black mushrooms (this was was surprisingly delicious). I also sampled my friends spicy beef noodle soup and it was amazing. Their lunch specials are a great value as well.   The prices are a little bit higher than other Sichuan restaurants in Pittsburgh, but I think the portions are much larger as well. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! For those of you who loved Spadina Garden on Dundas and Bay, and were sad to see them shut their doors, you can enjoy the same amazing dishes here. Tried it the other day, and this place stays true to its roots and makes some delicious Szechuan inspired food.  Favourite items include:   Spicy Peanut Chicken Shredded Beef (better than crispy ginger beef) Chill Chicken Chicken Corn Soup  RIP Spadina Garden, but I'm happy I found out about Szechuan Spice!!"}
{"text":"Walk by here almost daily for the last few years and glad to see they're open again. Don't know anything about prior or current ownership. But I do know the food is delicious and the portions are huuuuuuge!!! Prices on par with other restaurants of its caliber. Comfortable decor with a sushi bar. Love the ambience. Have enough leftovers for two days and I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"It was my first Chinese food delivery experience. Portions were big and i couldn't finish even half of them.  Food quality was good (not great) but satisfactory enough for this price range.  Delivery came very soon (much sooner that expect) and food was warm and in good shape expect sushis."}
{"text":"What a great Chinese place! There is a Chinese and American menu. I ordered from the Chinese menu, of course. The shredded pork in garlic sauce is supposedly one of their signature dishes. It was delicious! The portion sizes here are huge and I had enough for 1-2 meals worth of leftovers. The service was really quick too. This place is definitely worth to try for the large portion size, great price, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"My tour of Hakka places continues.  This time it was Szechuan Spice.  I noticed this place when I was at Golden Pocket Pita.  They are next door to each other.  Again as usual, my first meal at a Hakka food place is the Chilli Chicken and Hot and Sour soup. The H&S soup was decent in flavour and I liked it as it was not your standard brown glutoneous liquid with a few veggie floaters.  The soup really looked appetizing, however, it was a little better than luke warm - which throws off the flavour.  The server accidentally brought me the chicken corn soup and then promptly replaced it with my order.  What I think is happening is they pre-fill bowls of soup and leave it out for quicker service.  Really...how much effort is it to ladle out a bowl each time? The Chilli Chicken lacked heat and I found that they really over fried the protein.  Also the pieces of chicken itself was lost in the batter, as it was smaller chunks than other places.  It was quite hard and difficult to chew.  The gravy was mostly oily and was missing the green chilli peppers.  This is their version of the food, and unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. They do run a very busy shop and the staff is friendly.  Good to see that, what I am assuming is a family business, is doing well.  I for one will probably not frequent the place.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I ordered through the Eat24 food delivery service on Saturday evening around 6:45pm and unfortunately my food took almost two hours to come! Eat24's staff was very helpful (their online messaging system), however I really wish that delivery could be reliable!"}
{"text":"My friends and I (4 total) met up to celebrate our accomplishments from the semester. My friend made reservations for us which was not a problem. The place was well lit and the cooking from the kitchen left a delightful aroma which welcomed us in. We started with appetizers fried hot peppers and scallion pancakes. I was a fan of the pancakes bu the fried hot peppers were waaaaaay to hot for my American tongue. Only one of us were able to handle its spice but it was a cool experience. For my entree, I ordered the Chef's Special Szechuan Double Delight. The dish came out quickly and came with white rice. The flavor was delicious and it was a big portion. I probably could have shared it with someone else if I had eaten more rice. Additionally, I was able to take the rest home. The service overall was impeccable. We were given extra plates for sharing and water was refilled as needed. The mochi was also order for dessert and we were given a free scoop of ice cream since we had a hefty bill. They were also able to accommodate splitting the bill between us."}
