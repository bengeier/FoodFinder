{"text":"This is a review of the matcha sundae only.

I visited on a quiet Monday afternoon before their grand opening. I can see that parking at the plaza on evenings and weekends would definitely be challenging though, since there were only a few spots left open in the underground.

I was the only customer when I visited, and the staff were very friendly and made me feel welcomed. Their black sesame soft serve was not ready so I had the matcha soft serve sundae with a mix of fresh fruits ($8). The sundae was made to order in that the fruits were freshly cut right there and then. 

Unfortunately I did not enjoy the sundae, even though all the ingredients on its own were decent. Other than fresh strawberries, raspberries, and kiwi there was also a small scoop of red bean paste and clear jelly. I think the flavours do not work very well together and something is missing. I am sure matcha lovers will love this a lot more than I do but I definitely think some more fine tuning will greatly improve this recipe."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery/cafe in Markham. The people are friendly, the cakes are delicious and the environment is nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and the desserts look pretty, but the quality of the food was rather disappointing.

I ordered the matcha choux a la creme and the houjicha au lait. The matcha choux a la creme pastry was hard and chewy, definitely didn't taste fresh to me. The filling was very heavy, with a custard texture instead of the matcha cream which I had in mind.

The Houjicha au lait tastes like your regular tea latte, a bit too sweet even though I asked for half sweet and was told that they don't put sugar in. The worst part about it was the tea wasn't hot enough, it was at best luke warm."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to meet up with friends and talk with a japanese dessert.  Limited seating though, many plugs along the wall, worked here with my laptop for couple of hours.

matcha azuki - little on the dry side for my liking, but the layered with flavors of matcha, red bean and dark chocolate

choux a la creme (vanilla) - cream puff, yums, silky smooth filling, not overly sweet, thank goodness"}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0

Kirin Patisserie is a newly opened cafe and dessert shop brought to you by the folks from Tendou Matcha. I was a big fan of their soft serve so I was looking forward to see how this place is. However given the items that I tried, I must say it was a bit underwhelming:

Mont Blanc ($7.50) - A chestnut based tart. The top layer had a nice chestnut flavour and it wasn't too sweet either. However, the chestnut layer was a bit dry and crusty. Most likely because it had been left out for quite some time. 

Tarte Tiramisu ($7.75) - They use the same tart base as the Mont Blanc except there is chocolate cake inside the tart. It was not bad but would have liked the coffee liquor flavour to be more pronounced. 

Choux a la Creme ($4.75) - The texture of the cream was nice but matcha flavour was not too prominent. Others may find this to be bland with a hint of matcha bitterness from the after taste. 

For the price of the tarts, I expected a higher level of quality. If they are trying to emulate Duo Patisserie (which is at the same price level) then they have a long ways to go as their pastries are not near their level. Also it would be nice if they had a short description written below each item on their tags rather than just the name and price. It will provide more context and appeal to the customers.

The person that was taking orders was quite welcoming and approachable. She was able to provide feedback and recommendations quickly as well.

They are having a soft opening from 3/10 - 3/19 and there will be limited quantities of pastries available. Unfortunately their soft serve machine was out of service so we did not get to try it.

They will have new items rotating thru their menu as well so I will be on the lookout for that. Hopefully there will be some improvements down the road."}
{"text":"Quick fact: Tendou and Patisserie Kirin are one and the same or rather an evolution of the former to incorporate more coffee and pastries to their menu or so the server or attendant behind the counter told us. 

If you're used to more sweet ice creams, and especially if you expect matcha ice cream to be that creamy smooth sweet taste, THIS Is NOT the Ice cream for YOU. I'm not trying to shame anyone on their preferences but if the above is your expectation you may not enjoy this ice cream but I urge you to keep an open mind. The Matcha Ice Cream here has for what my partner and I that bitter sweet flavour that for us embodies the marriage between matcha powder (more earthy, bitter, and sometimes essence of the sea or seaweed tasting depending on where the matcha comes from). The sweetness is only the slighter side but you it definitely comes through and it definitely finishes with that bitter sweet highlights that remind you \"oh it's matcha, nice to make your acquaintance\". 

Kirin also has a selection reminiscent of Duo patisserie on Woodbine and Highway 7. 

We got the Choux A La Creme Matcha or Matcha Cream Puff. It has a lovely slightly hard texture akin to a pineapple bun, which provides a slight bite and a chew that's perfectly contrasts against the creamy filling to the matcha cream. The cream puff is also dusted with the matcha powder to again accentuate the bitter sweet flavour of the tea and the outside or the cream is brushed with a layer of simple syrup to give with a gloss and more rich colour while also offering you that slight hint of a sweeter taste against the bitter sweet of the matcha cream. Btw he presentation is not only elegant yet cute with the ornate tea spoons and dessert forks atop a small wooden carry tray. The cream puff also sits atop what can almost be described as a older candle holder with that curved protruding handle for you to grasp. 

We also bought two of their rectangles of layered cakes the matcha opera cake and the kirifuda. I will be updating this review later after we had a taste test post dinner meal. The take out box has a simple black design but opens on the like a butterfly door on a luxury vehicle, in that I mean it bottom front corner lifts up to allow you slide out cakes without much hassle of having to light the cake out of a box. 

Review of the opera cake and kirifuda. The matcha has this interplay of the bitter earthy matcha powder and the bitter sweet of the dark chocolate. It doesn't deliver very much in terms of texture but delivers a very indulgent rich envelopment in your mouth feel. I prefer the kirifuda it brings a third element or slightly tart flavour of the black currant as well as adds that praline crunch texture. The back half that looks to be covered in either chocolate, black currant or even a combination of the two add more sweetness to the cake. If you like you desserts a little sweeter the server recommended the kirifuda and the marron cakes. Also the only cake with milk chocolate is the chocolat praline. 

Patisserie Kirin is very much on the indulgent \"spend a few more dollars\" kind of fancy looking desserts. The interiors are nice and the fake marble vinyl tables give the appearance that matches the desserts. I would come back but just occasionally because \"I ain't made of money yo\" as my partner would say with a very bad thug like accent (lol)."}
{"text":"This place can be a little hard to find, just remember that it faces Highway 7.  First and foremost, I really like their ice cream - and this was before they turned into a cake shop lols.  Their service is great, as always, super gentle people and they are very customer-oriented.

So, now that I said all the good stuff, I'm sorry to say that their cakes are lacking in taste.  Since they first opened, I thought, let me give it a try and buy a whole cake.  And honestly this is my fault for not trying their individual slices first because the cake itself WAS SUPER SMALL.  For $45, i'd expect the cake to fill maybe 5-6 people?  No, unfortunately it only feeds 4 people.  Imagine their individual pieces but stacked side by side to create a square.  I agree with the cashier that there are many layers but the top was too sweet and the bottom layer comprised of a rough texture that I didn't like.  The cake I got was the mango one.  I'm not saying the cake sucks, but at a price point of $45 I can't imagine myself coming back to order one more.  I'd be back for their ice cream."}
{"text":"Not the best matcha soft serve I've tried. The soft serve was icier than excepted. There was still ice inside my soft serve. The environment was open and spacious. They also offer some very pretty cake slices for dine in and takeout. I'd come back again to try out their cakes next time."}
{"text":"Though for the most part I keep my diet pretty strict, sometimes I just have a hankering for something sweet, new, and tasty. Hence why I got a little giddy when I heard that Pâtisserie Kirin was opening up with a twist on the usual dessert fare.

Kirin is the reincarnation of Tendo Matcha & Desserts after a slight change in location, some rebranding, and a new menu. You'll find the mid-sized cafe/bakery around highway 7 & Warden (near Gal's Sushi if you're familiar with the area). The decor leans toward the minimalistic yet elegant side of things. There's a fair amount of table seating with chairs and benches, so you're free to bring the whole gang or sit by your lonesome and enjoy your own company. (Like myself. No shame.)

Like its predecessor, Kirin features several matcha inspired treats and drinks. I won't pretend to know what the health benefits are of matcha, but my hip and with it friends talk about the stuff like it's unicorn tears. What I can say is that though matcha is apparently supposed to be slightly bitter, the guys at Kirin have the know-how to not just cut that bitterness, but to completely neutralize it. This was definitely the case with their Matcha au lait tea. And shout-out to the generous amount of froth that helps make this an enjoyable drink to savour.

I started my pastry adventure with their Matcha Azuki Daifuku. These guys are half fist sized, doughy, white pastries, filled with a creamy matcha and red bean filling, and topped with matcha dust. I'm pretty sure these guys took the cake for me. (#punLife) Like all the pastries at Kirin, they are gently sweetened, which was quite the refreshing change in pace from the typical American pastry that sets off a sugar explosions on your tongue. They actually trick you into thinking you're eating \"healthy\". Sadly, I'll welcome you back to reality, because dessert is dessert. The last thing I loved about these is the gooey texture of the external pastry, that you bite through to meet even further gooey filling. I'll be craving this one for some time.

I also delighted myself in a choux à La crème, and a mont blanc. The choux à La crème is a larger pastry with similar filling to the Azuki Daifuku, but with a thicker and flackier exterior, whereas the mont blanc is completely different. With its unique look, the mont blanc starts to step into Instagramable food territory. The pastry consists of a sweet tart topped with what I'll incorrectly describe as spaghetti sugar fun. Rather than me butcher an explanation, have a look at a photo. Just know that it's a cute, little treat that doesn't disappoint in the flavour department.

So where do I fall on Pâtisserie Kirin in general? Well I wasn't kidding when I said I was giddy to try the place out, since I stopped by on their first soft opening day. So with that said, I couldn't tell you what the ambiance is like normally, or what everything is like on a regular day. What I can say is that the staff are welcoming, and for a guy who can easily not have sweets for months, this subtle twist on desserts has me craving round two. For now, I'm a big fan.

And word to the wise; apparently they have a rotating menu, so stop by for a surprise."}
{"text":"So I decide to pay them a visit after they rebranded them-self. On a Saturday night, this place isn't packed at all. My friend and I came by after early dinner hoping to grab some yummy treats. Kirin is located right next to Gal Sushi. 

Anyhow, we ordered a chocolate praline cake and kinako azuki shiratama. On picture both of these looked great. However only the cake is worth an honourable mention. So let's start: first off, the cake was moist and rich in flavour but not heavy. The base of the cake had a rice cake base. Not bad. The chocolate isn't too sweet, so this wasn't bad. The kinako azuki shiratama is very questionable. First off, the ice cream was meh. I can't even describe it. The fruits were tart and not ripe. Mochi balls were just unsweetened glutinous rice balls that had no flavour at all. Quite a disappointment. Only saving grace was the chocolate praline cake. That's about it. Price was a bit steep too and it didn't justify the cost, i.e. not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Patisserie Kirin sounds like an anime. Like the main character's super power is shooting whipped cream at people. Having said that, the name is appropriately Asian because well, they serve Asian-flavoured French style pastries.

These guys are brand new, sorta. They used to be Tendou, the popular soft serve place in the same plaza. But now they're going with the classic minimalist cafe look in a larger space. There are several tables which look great for the Starbucks laptop folks. But I'm guessing the main reason for re-branding is the branching out into pastry territory.

Along with some Western style cafe favourites like tiramisus, they bring in flavours like matcha and black sesame. I'm very excited to try the Yuzu Citron frap, though the syrup wasn't available yet on the day I went. I got a custard flauta in matcha and the pastry was flaky, not too sweet, and had strong hints of matcha reminiscent of their soft serve. For a limited time, any drink purchase also gets you a mini pastry so I got a tasty little palmier with my genmaicha tea. 

Their pastries are cute, though their selection doesn't seem very large. I see the potential for more flavours later on. I also think they can make the presentation a bit tighter. For example, some of the cream on top of the mont blancs seem to be a little lopsided. Definitely not a deal breaker, as I'm sure everything is still delicious but it'll better match the clean, pristine feel of the rest of the place. 

It's still early in their opening, so I haven't seen many people inside yet. Once they get that social media hype going, like with Tendou, I'm sure there'll be more. The more pastry shops in Markham, the better. Go, go, Kirin! I'm rooting for you!

{"text":"(Food:) 
HOUJICHA AU LAIT was light and not that sweet.  It's a good alternative to drinking coffee or bubble tea all the time.

TARTE TIRAMISU is quite expensive, but looks quite pretty.  Tastes pretty good too.

(Price:)
Houjicha Au Lait: $4.25
Tarte Tiramisu:  $7.75

(Ambience:)
Very quiet place to study, but difficult to find (It is on the side facing HWY 7).  Environment is sleek but the floors could use a bit more cleaning.  Tables are nice and spacious to do some work.  Lots of natural sunlight fills the area.  

(Service:)  
Great.  We even got free samples of Houjicha Frappe!

(Comparable:) 
Quieter than places like Aroma, and most other bubble tea places.  The Tarte Tiramisu reminds me of the Chatime cheese tarts."}
{"text":"We ordered their chocolate and vanilla cream puffs, chocolate croissant, regular coffee with creme on the side and their matcha au lait. 

Chocolate and vanilla cream puffs - one bite of their puffs and I was in heaven. The cream was airy and not too sweet, which reminded me of beard papa's cream puffs. Even though their price was a bit high at $4.50 each, I would still buy them again because they are so yummy. 9/10

Chocolate almond croissant - there was almond paste inside the croissant which were pretty good. Overall, it's not bad. 8/10.

Coffee - nice. 9/10

Matcha au lait - pretty good. On the same quality as Starbucks, maybe even slightly better. 9/10.

Service: the servers were all very courteous and helpful. The only thing they need to work on is learn how to use their credit card machine because the manager was trying to work with it when we were trying to pay for our order but after 5 min he was still unable to get it to work and we had to pay with cash. 7/10.

Ambiance: 8/10. I would bring my friends to this place for a casual hang out and chit chat."}
{"text":"Tendou is now Patisserie Kirin, which is located in the same plaza but on the other side, next to Gal's Sushi. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. We were excited to order our fave Black Sesame soft serve since we had no luck with our last visit to Tendou when we found out they were temporarily closed. Unfortunately it was not available due to the machine not working. We then ordered the Matcha soft serve - Warabi Mochi and they sold out of that mochi. Isabelle, who was taking our order, felt so bad, apologized and offered the other mochi that was available for free. We agreed and decided on a Matcha Soft serve and a Kirifuda opera cake. 

While having our dessert, Isabelle came over to tell us the machine was working again and offered us a cup of the sesame soft serve on the house! We were absolutely impressed with her service! 

Matcha Soft Serve - 
It was a bit too gritty, icy for our liking and it lacked a bit of sweetness. The mochi without the red bean, lacked sweetness as well.

Kirifuda - 
I love anything Black Currant! So this was a must try for me. I was able to taste the black currant in the cremeux and I loved the praline crunch on the bottom layer. 

Black Sesame Soft Serve - 
Loved the strong sesame flavour! Although I've noticed that it was a bit icier than the one we loved at Tendou.

Overall we give them 3 stars, as we were really happy with the service provided. Apparently I was informed that their grand opening is on June 2 so there is definitely room for improvement. We will be back to give another try.

{"text":"After a long winter, I've been looking forward to treats like soft serve. And when I heard to Patisserie Kirin just opened for their soft opening, it seemed like a great time to go check out this brand new cafe. By the owners of Tendou, this cafe serves black sesame and matcha flavours of soft serve that were popular at Tendou. They also serve delicious looking pastries.

The space is larger and more open in concept. Lots of seating for groups. They also have 2 wheelchair accessible washrooms within the cafe itself.

My cousins ordered the cream puffs which were soft in the middle, light, and filled with whipped cream. I enjoyed the texture of the pastry itself. 

 Hubby and I shared a mini cone with the black sesame and matcha soft serve swirl. Don't hate me but I found the soft serve texture to be different (icier perhaps? Less milky?) than when I last had it. I had really enjoyed the strong matcha and black sesame flavours from the previous Tendou location but somehow this time it felt watered down. Granted it is only the second day of their soft opening so I hope they tweak the texture and flavour of their soft serve.

Despite a slightly disappointing swirl mini cone, I would definitely return to try more of the cafe's offerings, soft serve, and Japanese tea beverage options. 3.25 stars"}
{"text":"So my friend decided to lasso me and another friend for dessert.

She got us 5 things: praline, matcha, chestnut, sesame, and strawberry.

All pretty mild, though I'd have to say the chestnut was the mildest. I didn't try the sesame because I'm not a fan of sesame in general. Praline tasted like Ferrero and matcha was... Well it's matcha. It was alright.

I would've preferred if there were stronger flavours in the cakes. Otherwise, the flavours seemed too simple for me and didn't really hook me in. 

What pulled the rating from 3 to 4 is the cleanliness and look of the place. Very clean, minimalist look. The pastry case looked full.

I also thought it was cute and funny that one of the desserts was called \"brown\" in French."}
{"text":"The place is really clean and it's nice and quite. Currently a nice location to have a nice coffee with a pastry.

Their current promo is when you get a drink you can get a nice small chocolate mousse files creme puff. 

The tiramisu tarts was very tasty. The bold chocolate flavour from the tart blend really well with the custard filled marshmallow dome. And in that dome it has a soaked piece of cake in the centre. I wish there was a little less custard but a little bigger piece of cake. The edges for the tart can be a little thinner as well.

The fruit tart was very refreshing. The custard in that was creamy.  It had the right amount of fruits to pair with each bite of the tart. 

Their house coffee was very interesting. I don't think I would get it the next time though.

On the other hand I enjoyed the tiramisu latte more. Maybe it's cause it has more milk... the flavours was very yummy. The sad part for the beverage was it lacked the latte art."}
{"text":"I'm glad tendou is back! I used to love their soft serves here and with a greater selection of treats and drinks, Patisserie Kirin is greater than ever. 

The shop now facing Highway 7, is bigger, there's more seating, and is nicer. However since they are only in soft opening, it does seem rather bear and the menu is on a board. 

Unfortunately when I went their soft serve ice cream machine was down so we went with a matcha cream puff and a kurogama (black sesame) latte. We were also given a cheesecake to sample which was a nice gesture. 

The matcha cream puff was light and featured a crisp exterior pastry. The inside cream filling was delightful with their strong matcha. They use some great quality matcha here and it was not overly sweet. 

The kurogama latte wasn't anything to write home about though. It wasn't warm enough and the black sesame was really light. It was lacking a richness. 

The cheesecake we were given was great. It was light yet rich, and again wasn't overly sweet. It was citrusy and refreshing. 

Please do note they do not accept card under $10. We'llack for sure for tasty Japanese inspired treats and drinks."}
{"text":"Good points - houjicha au lait was delicious. Cakes have a good flavor to them, highly recommend the zangetsu for sesame lovers. 

Bad points - the coffee has a strong bitter finish to it when it should be more mild. No air-conditioning yet.

Ordered the Zangestu and Natsumi cakes, house blend coffee, and a houjicha au lait.

8/10 - would visit again."}
{"text":"I went during their soft opening and tried their tasting platter, which consisted of 9 different signature mini cakes and cream puff. We got to chat with the owner and found out he trained with a master baker in Japan. The ingredients he uses are high quality including matcha sourced from Japan. 

The cakes and cream puffs were not too sweet which I liked and were very fresh. 

The drinks were also very unique, we had a yuzu frap which was very refreshing and a roasted marshmallow frap which is great for the summer.

I will definitely come back with more of my friends!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the great reviews and got soft serve and some pastries to go. They have cakes as well, but I felt like concentrating on pastries this time. The guy who took my order was very friendly and helpful, and the presentation of the bakeries were attractive.

Pastries: I usually don't like cream puffs, but decided to try the matcha cream one. I was not disappointed. The pastry was buttery and crispy, and had some matcha topping which reminded me of HK style pineapple bun. The matcha had a nice strong taste with a slight bitterness, so the whole combination worked well, making this not too sweet. The blueberry filling of the danish was sweet and tart with a nice crispy base, and the almond croissant had the same buttery rich flavor, with almond paste that tasted a bit like the filling of HK style coconut bun.

Ice cream: I wanted to try both the sesame and matcha flavours, so I got the swirl. At first taste, the combination didn't seem to work because both had strong flavors, especially, the sesame taste was overpowering the matcha. However, because they are so generous with their serving (double the amount I got at Saryo, for example), it tasted strangely compatible in the end, lol. Let me explain. I attempted to just eat the matcha flavor alone first. Like the filling off the cream puff, the matcha had a nice rich taste with the distinct tea bitterness. Then I had the sesame flavor, which too was rich and fragrant and sweet. If I had gotten only the matcha flavour, the bitterness would've been too much towards the end, and if only the sesame flavour, it would've been too sweet and filling. Now that it's the swirl mix, I could only eat each flavour alone for so long before they're mixed too closely together to separate. That was perfect, because then the sweetness of the sesame balanced the bitterness of the matcha, making the whole marriage work to become less filling.

I will come again for their soft serve and try their cakes next time."}
{"text":"Ambiance/Service: 4 stars 
Food/Price: 3 stars 

Dropped by Friday afternoon for something sweet.  I was planning to get the Tiramisu Tart or Mont Blanc based on pictures from other reviewers, but on the day I went, neither was available.  Instead, they have a full selection of fresh cakes.  I think they rotate the selection of desserts they offered, so do be prepared to make a decision on the spot to try something new if they don't have the one you had in mind. 

The lady managing the counter was really friendly.  She offered samples of the cake and also recommendation of what to get.  The cakes were not my cup of tea (based on the flavor and texture), however, there were a lot of flavor and variety to choose from, so people could pick what they like based on their preference.  It will be good for those who want to try something new.    

At the end, I opt for the fruit tart.  It was pretty standard, nothing too special but overall is not bad.  It will definitely satisfy you if you are craving something sweet. 

Overall given the different options around the area, unfortunately this would not be my go to shop for pastries and desserts."}
{"text":"Tendou matcha has reinvented itself into Patisserie Kirin - it's a nice change! It's still in the same location (but now in a much bigger space facing Highway 7) but a lot is different.

They've gone the clean/minimalistic route for the interior, with faux white marble tabletops and black. It does a good job of being clean looking without being too stark (which I find Duo Patisserie to be) because of the nice natural light coming in through the windows. It was quite comfortable there.

Very roomy inside, no one was there when I went and so I got excellent and friendly service.

I bought a fruit tart ($4.75) and their zangetsu (black and white sesame with white chocolate, $6.75). Both were delicious - the zangetsu was super heavy on the sesame so if you like sesame this would be a good choice! The fruit tart was refreshing with custard, which I really like. The only reason this is three stars is that I got mild food poisoning from the fruit tart... I recall there being a Yelp review about issues regarding this particular dessert as well but I think it's been deleted. I think it would be good for the business to look into their supplier or perhaps look at how their fresh fruit is handled. It happens sometimes. I love fruit tarts and it was delicious, but I think I will avoid fruit tarts from here for the time being.

Their soft serve has changed a bit as well - very rich in matcha flavour, though icier in texture than before. Still good.

Will be back! Just not for the fruit tarts."}
{"text":"A very welcoming environment, good place to come in small groups. This plaza itself is pretty busy but there are so many different popular chains, such as dessert kitchen or gong cha. 

We ordered two choux a la creme desserts (vanilla & matcha) which where $3.80 each. This is simply a more fancy cream puff, with lots of smooth & decadent filling. I personally enjoyed the vanilla more, the filling reminded me of an egg tart! The shell of the puff is perfectly baked, it doesn't crumble & has a nice chew to it. The matcha flavour is also really good, there is a good balance of bitter and sweet matcha flavours. So good. The cream was thick & there was a lot of it. Delicious & not a waste of money. 

My friend ordered the matcha sesame swirl, which comes in a waffle cone for around $6. Compared to other speciality ice cream places this cone is worth it, there's so much ice cream & it isn't crazy expensive. There are bits of matcha you can taste & the sesame flavour is fragrant. The ice cream for a soft serve is more thick &a rich, doesn't melt as easily. A definite favourite spot for soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Came here to buy takeout dessert after hearing Tendou opened this new patisserie. The staff recommended the Tiramisu Tart and Matcha Opera Cake. The presentation is great but the taste is mediocre. The price is also more on the expensive side because the two cakes cost me $16 after tax. If I visit again, I will probably stick to the Tendou soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"A place to chill with a friend or two!! Their cakes are not too too sweet! But I feel like a little over priced, just a little! Haha

They are in warden HSBC plaza, facing hwy7, beside Gal's sushi! 

Maybe it was a monday, so they dont have the other cakes like the others posted!

Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at Patisserie Kirin, and every time has been a good experience! Today I tried the Dessert Omakase and it was so good! I love the fact that you get to try almost everything on their menu, and it comes with 2 drinks of your choice for $26. 

My favourite was the matcha opera, as it had a rich matcha flavour and wasn't overly sweet. Paired with the black sesame frappe, it was a great combo!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize this place was from the owners of Tendou. This was a pretty nice place; it is spotless and the staff are very friendly. If you buy a drink right now you get a mini chocolate cream puff. I ordered the House Coffee for $2.50, though they have quite a few coffee and tea options available in cold or hot. I also had the fruit tart, which was pretty good. It wasn't too sweet and had fresh fruits. The selection of sweets is all right, though it seems they are still slowly expanding their menu. They have WiFi and many outlets along the bench, which is showing promise as a decent study/work spot."}
{"text":"The newly renovated and revamped Tendou. Beautifully renovated space with marble table tops- perfect for flat lays! Since they serve lattes and Its pretty spacious and relatively quiet, I can see myself coming here to study :) Ice cream tasted different than how tendou's used to taste imo. Same flavours offered but Patisserie Kirin does it less creamy and more icy. I preferred the black sesame flavour over the matcha. 

Matcha creme choux - Comes with a hefty amount of matcha cream that will fill you up after a couple bites. Would not recommend eating this by yourself

Bara cake- surprisingly tasted just as good as it looks!! Has a strong tangy raspberry flavour with a hint of dark chocolate underneath. Really loved this and would recommend."}
{"text":"Came from Seattle for the soft opening. I was a big fan of Tendou (the former brand), but ever since they expanded to become a dessert shop, I knew I had to come back. 

Space is great. A lot more modern and spacious than the previous store.

Loving the mocha au lait. Tried the selection of dessert they had. Can't go wrong with any of them!

I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Not the best of the best.
I would give one star, but I'll add one just for my best friend who has a soft heart.

Sorry to say, but I've had a creme puff in the subway station of Hong Kong better than this one :(

I got their vanilla creme puff and my best friend got their matcha creme puff. The creme has a custard-like consistency and isn't too sweet. The pastry itself is soft in the interior with a crunchy crust to coat. My friend said the matcha powder on top of hers made the pastry notably bitter.

I felt that the consistency of the creme and the puff pastry didn't work quite well with each other.

I wasn't quite impressed, but i might return to try their sample cake platter :')"}
{"text":"New cafe shop, currently open for soft opening. Formerly known as Tendou. The cream puffs and matcha au lait hot were amazing. 

Space: clean, modern and very open. Can sit around 25-30 people in the cafe. The lighting and decor is very aesthetically pleasing. A big upgrade from the previous store.

Food: the pastries were all shown at the glass display. The vanilla cream puff has a nice crispy top and the filling is just the right amount of sweetness. The matcha au lait hot was DELICIOUS! Really digging it right now.
 
Overall a cafe with a lot of potential and I will definitely be back to try the other pastries!"}
