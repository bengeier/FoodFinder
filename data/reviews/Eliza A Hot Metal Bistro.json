{"text":"Amazing new restaurant! It is in the contemporary Indigo hotel. Highly recommended! Creative, eclectic menu and drinks. The pretzel and beer cheese and crispy Brussel sprouts were excellent appetizers. The indigo house special drink was tasty and colorful! I really enjoyed the Jamison lamb meatballs. The sauce was amazing! The tamarind pork belly on pita beat was worth the trip alone. Incredible flavors! I also had the pepper appetizer with goat cheese. It had a perfect amount of spice. My wife had the salmon. She loved the crust and rice and plump beans that were the sides. The blueberry creme brulee was filled with sweet fresh blueberries. My wife had the warm brownie Sunday with Millies ice cream. Decadent! The staff and service were exemplary. They were only open 3 days, but you would never know. Definitely a five star experience, both food and service."}

{"text":"We heard that his restaurant had opened even though the hotel (Hotel Indigo) wasn't open yet.  We decided to give it a try.  BEST. DECISION. EVER.  The restaurant  was empty when we went in at lunch time but then more diners came in after us.  The restaurant is gorgeous.  It's very contemporary, industrial, and now.  We were greeted with the door to the restaurant being opened for us.  We were quickly seated.  The decor is a mix of blues, oranges, browns, and industrial materials.  The art on the walls is all about the Burgh but from a very different perspective.  There is a very nice outdoor seating area.  There is a big community table near the bar. The lighting is a mix of contemporary (the bar lights) and the lights over the community table are industrial.  The colors and the look of the restaurant pull you in.  We were given menus and there was a nice selection to choose from.  I went with the Scottish Salmon.  The hubby went with the Club sandwich.  We decided to start with Brussel Sprouts as a starter.  I'm not a huge brussel sprout fan but these were roasted and topped with a little shaved Parmesan cheese.  There is a lemon aioli served beside it and it was a wonderful companion to the sprouts.  The portion is huge so you might want to share with two to four people.  The club sandwich was also very large.  It had huge slices of fresh tomato and fresh avocado.  The bacon on the sandwich has a rich smoky flavor that adds to the taste.  It also had an Amish white cheddar that played nicely into the bite.  You have a choice of fresh cut fries or a side salad to go with the sandwich.  You also have the choice of doing half a sandwich and a cup of soup.  I had the salmon and I really didn't want to share.  It is a nice cut of salmon that is placed on top of asparagus, mushrooms, and Carolina Gold rice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the asparagus.  Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and some places just can't get it right.  Here-they nailed it.  It was the Carolina Gold rice that sealed the 5 star deal.  I don't know what it is made with but oh my goodness, it is like liquid gold.  I could have eaten just a plate of that although you might die from the richness.  Not wanting to stop the party, I ordered Blueberry Creme Brûlée.  It was the perfect ending to the meal.  My husband is not a Brûlée fan but he enjoyed it.  The blueberries were fresh and whole.  They were just a blend swirled in.  Of course we all know that the way to know Brûlée is on pointe is if you hear the cracking sound when you put your spoon through it.  The cracking was loud and proud.  Our server, Lana, gave us VIP service.  Toward the end of our meal a very nice woman named Liz came to our table and chatted with us.  We asked if we could see the lobby of the hotel.  She told us that the hotel was actually open.  She asked if we would like a tour of the hotel.  YES!!!  So the bartender, Jess, took us on a tour once we were done eating.  I found out later that Liz is one of the owners.  This was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The restaurant is in the middle of a technology park and part of a hotel and that may make some people think they want to pass because sometimes hotel restaurants aren't that great.  No matter where you live in the city, you need to go and check out this restaurant.  It is easy to get to and you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Today is the official opening day of Eliza's Bistro's and I was glad to visit it. The bistro is under different management than the Hotel Indigo which houses it but it carries the same industrial motif and color scheme as the hotel itself. Since this place was built on the former site of a J and L Steel mill the bistro decided to also recreate the authenticity of what once stood here. I was literally blown away by the paintings and the designer who I had met over at the hotel told me that they were planning on putting in a large full wall painting over in the corner. Even the ceiling made you feel like you were in a blast furnace. They also have free WiFi here. I also learned that in the near future they will be having weekend brunch.  I had a very friendly and helpful waitress. I sat in a booth away from the bar and high top area so I could take in the surroundings. Outdoor seating is available if you choose. I learned the place was named for a granddaughter of the J and L Steel Mill whose name was Eliza. I also learned that Steel mills used to carry names associated with their blast furnaces.  Most everything with the except the salmon is local sourced. The salmon comes from Ohio. I wanted to try the Brussels Sprouts so my waitress substituted that with my fried chicken sandwich as my side. Normally you get a side of French Fries or small salad with dressing.  I got my food fairly quickly. The sandwich was topped with coleslaw and had cheese on the bottom. The sandwich was moist and tender. I found the Brussels Sprouts a little on the dry side but my waitress explained to me that they are fire grilled. That made me happy because I love Brussels sprouts and was able to enjoy them better.  I'm glad they made that substitution because I wanted to try one of their desserts. Today they were offering standard flavors of Millie's ice cream or homemade cheesecake topped with cherries. I opted for the latter since I'm well acquainted with Millie's and can attest that they have good ice cream.  My cheesecake was not overly large which I was glad about but moist and delicious! I can see this place becoming very popular with the locals once word is out. There is a free lot outside the complex before you enter. Next to it stands a pay parking garage. There is no public transportation and I'm not sure if the shuttle I learned about in the hotel would cater to restaurant patrons. Since they are in a hotel they are open every day of the year which makes it a bonus if you would rather eat out during the holidays.  Eliza's bistro sits in the Hotel Indigo which is in the middle of Technology Dr that runs parallel to 2nd Ave. The only real drawback I can see is having to deal with rush hour traffic. Other than that it is well worth a visit. Good food at reasonable prices. You can't ask for more."}
