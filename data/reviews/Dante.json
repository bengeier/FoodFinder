{"text":"Review of Late Night Noodle menu only ....

Ok ... so we only came here for ramen ... always on the look-out for great ramen in Cleveland (still to be found) ... while the toppings were fine ... these really were just dried ramen out of the bag with fancy toppings ... the broths were really overpowering ... my only point of rating this a one-star is hoping that the chef who opened next door Ginko fixes this menu (even store bought fresh noodles would be a huge improvement) ... anyways ... multiple chef colleagues highly rave about Dante being the best restaurant in the city ... now I can see why the wait staff gave us funny looks when ramen is all we ordered and were encouraging us to order other things ... please fix the ramen on this menu or take it off, it's too embarrassing to your otherwise great reviews.  For those who think you've found a great ramen secret in the city like we did ... it's not publicized for a reason."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner. Great drinks and food. The lamb was so good. The clam chowder is exceptional too. Wonderful environment. Not a lot of parking. In an old bank with a great look. For a gourmet restaurant the portions were very large. The desert (apricot streusel) was glorious."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Dante the evening before Thanksgiving and were pleased to find that our experience met the high expectations we had based on reviews we'd heard from others. The wine selection and guidance was spot-on, and the the range of the menu's selections offered a pleasant conundrum. We particularly relished the salmon and sea bass. The space itself provided a neat ambiance, and we enjoyed checking out the massive vault that houses the cured meats. Next time we return we plan to try the blue crab gratin and lobster/scallop pot pie!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been for a multi-course Goose Island beer dinner (which was amaaazing) and recently, for happy hour. I have to say, this place is now at the top of my list for happy hour. The prices are very reasonable for some delicious asian-themed snacks. The hi-light was their Toban Yaki - little ceramic plates of vegetables and fish or meat perfectly cooked in a soy sauce. Yum! The cocktails are deliciously strong, but you can also get a beer for a couple of bucks. Pass on the sushi pop but hit up happy hour at Ginko downstairs instead."}
{"text":"Impeccable Food and Service!  Dante's did not disappoint.  Our server Darlene was personable and helpful and fun!  She helped us make our choices, love the 3 portion sizes available.  She suggested we start with the lobster roll and had it cut in half in the kitchen so we could share it, it was excellent!  Next, we had the tuna tartar, and omg, this was fabulous.  We then did some tasting portions of the carbonara and bolognese pasta.  Even tried the 3 cheese polenta.  Everything was delicious.  Loved the atmosphere too, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Dante.  The menu is suitable for all tastes and I especially like the portion options for some of the dishes (taste, appetizer & entree).  I like having the option of getting a few items to try and this is menu is certainly accomodating.  Nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Tasting menu is so good!! And incredible experience, it's full of surprises and every dish is delicious and so tasty, we went for our anniversary and they gave us a glass of champagne to celebrate. Very kind staff and always willing to clarify whatever you need."}
{"text":"Food was not bad, not the best Italian food I've ever had but certainly not the worst.  The wait staff is NOT friendly at all.  Both of my sisters, who each went on separate occasions, had the same experience with rude servers.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Five of us went for dinner.  New to the NE Ohio area from Chicago, we really wanted to like this place, having already been disappointed by most of the other allegedly world-class area restaurants (especially the deeply average Lola Cafe).  Sadly, and despite the breathless reviews on this site, this place is just okay.

There were highlights among the cocktails and starters.  I had a Manhattan up and it was fantastic.  As often cited, the tuna tartare is excellent.  The charcuterie plate was solid: very good meats, interesting assortment.  The seven vegetable salad was very good.  The huge, unforgivable miss was the pickled hearts of palm salad (two of us had that).  They were inedible: hard, fibrous, woody.  You just can't have that in a quality restaurant, and the server did not bother to ask why the hearts of palm was untouched.

The mains were a mixed bag, but mostly off.  I had the double porkchop: it was overcooked and therefore a bit dry, served in an uninspired sauce.  Two of us had the carbonara: the pancetta was present but the flavor was completely missing, totally lost in a bowl of warm, bland cream and egg.  The bite of parsley was also missing and the whole dish was very unseasoned: we had to request salt and pepper.  The chicken got good reviews, as did the duck.  As with so many local restaurants the portions are just too big.  It's off-putting to get this huge slab of food in front of you, especially as quantity seems to come at the expense of attention to detail.

A worrying sign in any restaurent of this price range is schtick, and Dante has it with the truly bizarre candy assortment at the front of the restaurant, which is then passed around at the conclusion of your meal.  Probably lots of folks think this is fun, but we thought it a cheesy touch.

Our waitress needs to go back to finishing school.  She was nice, but she did amateurish things like handing us our drinks instead of putting them on the table and mispronouncing every French word.  She was nice but not in a hurry.  And be forewarned: this place is LOUD, which a lot of hip restaurants seem to think adds to the buzz but all it does is make it a strain to talk to your fellow diners.

A B minus effort.  Our search for the great restaurant in Ohio continues."}
{"text":"The food was unbelievable and a great ambiance to match! We started with a plate of meats (cured in house) and split carbonara and muscles for our entr√©e. Our service was great as well! We're new to the area and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"To start our server was really strange and was constantly bothering us with his really dry, awkward sense of humor. It was really uncomfortable. The portion sizes were laughable. I ordered their \"surf and turf\" which was salmon and short rib. I'm really mad that I didn't take a picture of the short rib to post on here as it was about 2-3 bites. The salmon was average at best. My girlfriend ordered a seafood dish which consisted of shrimp, scallops, and squid. The scallops weren't very good, the shrimp was average, the squid was average, and the sauce was TERRIBLE. Her brother ordered the duck which again was average. The worst part about the meal was the price. It is one of the more expensive restaurants in Cleveland. I'm okay a pricey restaurant or small portion sizes if the food is good but it wasn't. I was extremely disappointed especially since I heard good things about Dante and needless to say I would never go back."}
{"text":"Chef Dante does it again.

They recently rolled out their new menu and it's pretty decent. We weren't wowed by the entrees, so we decided to stick with the small plates.

We started off with the Hawaiian Tuna Tartar. I did not care for the poached egg on top, but I really dug the caper remoulade and the elegant potato crisp. The tartar was followed by the Smoked Salmon Parfait--smoked salmon, avocado, and a potato foam. Very interesting. The avocado was fresh and the potato foam was mousse-like in consistency with hints of sour cream. My only complaints about the parfait was that it could have used more salmon (it was very heavy on the potato foam and avocado) and it didn't even come in a parfait glass--it was served on a pretty glass platter. Our last appetizer was the Maine Lobster Spring Rolls. Perfection. The lobster was succulent and tender and probably the highlight of the night. I highly recommend.

Next came the Banana Butternut Squash Soup, Potato Gnocchi, and the Garlic Butter Snail Oyster Mushroom Polenta. The soup was very different, in a good way. It was sweet, yet savory, with lots of pumpkin flavor with a nice pile of cinnamon foam on top. Another highlight of the night. The gnocchi was tossed in a gorgonzola cream sauce. That sauce was EVERYTHING. I could seriously just eat spoonfuls of it. If you are going to order any pasta, I recommend the tasting size. It's the perfect amount if you plan on ordering other food. You won't get full and you'll still get to try it. The polenta is a really generous portion, to the point where you can't finish it. I wish the polenta had been thicker.

I personally find the desserts here to be overpriced. Go with the dessert tasting menu. It's a much better value. We choose the Lemon Meringue Parfait, Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme, and Floral Black Tea Panna Cotta. All were excellent. The best was probably the panna cotta. I'm not a huge panna cotta fan because the texture and consistency kind of creeps me out, but it was delicious, especially with the apple sorbet which seriously tasted like frozen applesauce.

Random, but the hot tea here is really high quality. They serve it in a french press. It's a nice touch. It was the best hot tea I have ever had.

And last but not least, service. Our server Dan was incredible. He was very personable and had great menu knowledge. His wine knowledge was extensive and informative, offering plenty of information on pairings and producers."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a colleague of mine to Dante for some of the best food in town. They were certainly on point with that one.

My wife and I decided to go with the Chef's tour which consisted of several small courses of meats, cheese, main course and dessert. Everything was well prepared and there is no doubt in my mind that they use the highest quality ingredients in their food. Their wait staff is also very helpful and courteous.

It's nice to occasionally dress up and play rich for a minute. My only complaint is more for the patrons attending there more than anything. I realize we are in an upscale establishment but where the heck do some people get their cruddy attitudes from? I normally don't like to complain too much about the little things but this greatly impacts my dining experience. If you attend Dante, please be nice and smile, you are enjoying some of Cleveland's finest. Everyone deserves to try it at least once because it is a real treat."}
{"text":"Wow service a bit slow on a tues night, only coursed out times four... however the tuna tartare was perfect. foie gras amazing. menu set up to eat as little, or as much, as you like. novel concept for the Midwest but a welcome one for sure. Can't wait for Dante Akron... definately going broke there. bar staff btw was so attentive and professional. like I always say GO! carbonara is stupid good, sorry for being vague but it is. and as usual I conned the hostess out of a menu...priceless"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with this restaurant on multiple levels.

First, my friend and I received excellent service sitting at the bar. The bar is always hit or miss, but the bartender was attentive, taking our orders promptly and refilling our water glasses regularly. We were never left wanting!

Second, I love the concept of tasting and half portions. We all know that restaurant portions have exploded, so to have this kind of control over portion size is fantastic, and also allows one to try a few different things. I ordered a half portion of the banana and butternut squash soup, and and a tasting portion of the Bhutanese red rice. Both were unique and delicious,  and I must say, the portions were still very generous! I ended up taking most of the rice dish home, and I paid less for what ended up being two meals than for my glass of wine!

The last comment does not mean that I thought the wine was overpriced. Although it is common to pay far too much for wine by the glass, the glass pour list was diverse and interesting enough that it didn't bother me. The worst is paying $10 for a glass of wine that you know sells for $7 at Giant Eagle!

Last but not least, although it was very crowded, I found that my friend and I were still able to have a decent conversation, so Dante has avoided the problem of poor sound absorption.

I had a wonderful first visit, and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome and the food was fantastic. Started with the Hawaiian tuna tartare and had the white tuna which was perfect and my husband had the fish special that he loved. For dessert we did the coconut creme caramel. Don't leave without having that for dessert!"}
{"text":"Awful!  Rude waiter after waiting forever to get a table.   Food was Not special at all.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Dante provided our party with, by consensus, the best meal/party we have ever had.  He catered a private party for a special event and every single morsel of food was delicious - 6 fantastic courses -  appetizers, first course, lemon pasta, fish, beef and dessert, every course unique and special.  Both the presentation and the timing were perfect and the service was flawless, a combination of professional and personal.  It was an extraordinary and magical evening because of Dante and his team and all fifteen of us will remember it always."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We had the Chef's Tasting Menu! So full by the end of it though! Great combination of flavors! Atmosphere was very romantic"}
{"text":"If you happen to dine at Dante please avoid the Duck, you'll thank me for it. Unless of course you enjoy having your weekend ruined due to food poisoning and the like. Good service and atmosphere but not worth the risk."}
{"text":"Dante was a memorable dining experience...for good reasons.  We had a 6:30 Saturday evening reservation and were seated on time.  At first I thought I would be disappointed when lead to the back room...but we enjoyed the intimate setting, able to hear conversation easily of those at your table. Our table of 4 had the fried oysters and shrimp/calamari appetizers; main dishes were the salmon, a ribeye cooked to the chef's preference, and the daily special of fried walleye.  We chose the carnaroli rice because our server said paired nicely with the seafood which proved correct.  Desert was the chocolate pomegranate torte.  Everyone was pleased with their selections.  Our server was knowledgeable as we took and appreciated his suggestions.  Expensive?  Yes, for me to make Dante a habit, but I would gladly and eagerly return."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in a very cool setting. The service - our server was Michael - is fantastic. The menu is interactive allowing you to order different sizes of things to allow you to taste several different options on the menu. We sat on their attractive back patio and started with the Hawaiian Tuna Tartare - nothing special. Our main entrees were the Risotto (Carnaroli with Heirloom Tomatoes) - very very good, and the Linguine Alla Carbonara - good but nothing to write home about.

It's a very classy upscale place that is perfect for a date and definitely recommended to try. As I said earlier, their menu allows for the opportunity to try a lot. They also have a cool bar with a lot of options.

Glad I tried Dante but I have no burning desire to make myself a regular. Just a little too fancy for me."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this restaurant is lovely and the service was up to par. Unfortunately my wife got food poisoning and we found ourselves in the emergency room the next day."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Love that they have a tasting option for some of the meals. The male bartender is awesome. Good place."}
{"text":"Service and drinks are fantastic.  Food - I've had better. 

In the Tremont area of Cleveland (see my thoughts on review of Lolita).  The building is really cool.  In an old bank building.  There are tables available in the vaults themselves (although I'd feel a little claustrophobic - what if the door closed on us!?!)  They kept the original moldings on the ceiling and it's gorgeous.  
The service was impeccable.  Our server was knowledgeable, attentive but not too present.  

I had the foie gras and carbonara.  All the accompaniments for the foie gras were spot on.  I just wish the rhubarb muffin was smaller.  I ended up with too much muffin and not enough foie.  I love a good house made pasta and the linguine for the carbonara was just that.  Perfectly al dente, perfect bite.  The house made pancetta sucked - there was no flavor and not enough pieces.  The poached egg was a nice touch but because the sauce was already quite \"saucey\", the egg yolk just added to the juice of the pasta.  I like my carbonara not swimming in sauce on drier land.  This one was treading water. Loved the concept of three different sizes of pasta, risotto, and polenta.  This way, you can try a lot more without getting stuck with too much of one dish. 

I had a delicious cocktail (forgot the name!) that consisted of gin, violet?, and a black cherry on the bottom.  Weird, I know.  But it worked.  Not too sweet, not too dry.  Super strong.  Delish!

The ambiance of this place is better compared to Lolita down the street if you want to hold a conversation with your dinner party - no yelling involved."}
{"text":"Their ahi tuna appetizer would be an Island meal for me. It is mouthwatering. My husband and I have gone here quite often and when I was pregnant I swear I almost cried when he ordered the tuna:( 

I like the winter polenta's as they are usually hearty, flavorful with a braised meat usually, perfect with a hearty burgundy! I don't get to eat rabbit often and it was something my grandmother made so I usually get it here if offered.  I Loved a whole ranibow trout they had with crispy potatoes. The rock shrimp app was also amazing. The cavatelli is a favorite of my husbands.

The carbonna was pretty underwhelming as was the leek and endive salad.  

I like that he cures his own charcuterie which is a healthy portion when served. 

Adds another great restaurant to Tremont and I'm glad he left the east side and is so successful here."}
{"text":"As if the food wasn't good enough, the customer service at Dante is beyond compare. I came here alone on a business trip and have been treated so exceptionally that I just might have to come back tomorrow. 

The menu is divine and allows for sampling with tasting options (because picking one or two is just too difficult) and the wine menu is extensive to match. Partway through my meal the charming bartender, Paul, asked if I would like to move from my seat at the bar to the \"cockpit\" (look it up on Facebook) and I've had a wonderful time chatting with visitors and regulars alike while seeing first-hand how well this place is run from top to bottom. 

A new favorite and I will be back!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a good place to celebrate our country's freedom with family...

Very poor service. Rude management. Would not recommend. Go across the street to Lolita."}
{"text":"This is honestly the BEST restaurant in Cleveland! Chef Boccuzzi is amazingly talented as is his staff...front to back. The food is always on point and the service is always 5 star! We love this place! 

We don't get to go out as often as we used to (kids!) but when we do, we often think we want to try something new. Many times we end up right back here, because it's hard to breakaway from perfection!! 

Thank you Chef Boccuzzi for creating and running such an awesome place here in CLE! We love it! Try the Chefs Tasting...you will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm reviewing the Late Night Noodle Menu only!

The noodle menu seems to be bar-only, which was actually pretty empty around 10:30 when we went, but I have a feeling it picks up after people leave the local bars and realize they're hungry. Anyway, the menu is pretty straightforward; you choose your order size, noodle type and broth. We tried the ramen, udon and soba (in miso and pork soups I think). What I did like was the big piece of pork belly in each half order, with a decent amount of noodle + soup. But since I'm pretty picky with Asian food, I have to say that there is much room for improvement in some of these. The udon noodles were actually pretty decent, but the ramen noodles tasted like they came out of an instant ramen pack. The soba was just so-so. And the broths were far saltier than they need to be, but that is kind of the nature of miso. The service was good - the bartender wasn't busy, so we ordered promptly and the noodles didn't take long.

I will definitely give this menu another try, as the beef broth might be less salty and I did like the udon noodles. Also, I have to eat here for dinner!

Update 8/26/12: I went again last night for late night noodles and got the udon + pork broth, which was the best combination imo. Tasty noodles + not-too-salty broth = happy stomach. They did not put in the pork belly, which was a little disappointing, but they may have run out of it. The bartender is great; he offered a beer on the house because the one ordered was not available."}
{"text":"Had reservation at 8:45, had to wait by the bar until 9:20 to get a table.  Bartender seemed agitated that we asked for non-alcoholic beverages while we waited for our table.  Then a group walks in after us and gets seated before us.  Then, we're seated past the kitchen in the closed patio area and it's so cold in February!!!  We asked to be reseated in the main area and got some table by high traffic.  The place isn't very big.  Waiter was professional and was good.  Food was overrated -- each dish appeared to have one flavor that overpowered the other dishes - perhaps that's Chef Dante's style.  Was overpriced.  I've had better food and definitely a better seating experience.  Current hostess needs to go."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had anywhere in the world, much less Cleveland, and for a lot less than I would have paid for something comparable at a Vegas or NYC restaurant.  The tuna tartare, charcuterie, chicken miso soup, steak, and twice-baked brownie were all in the outstanding to mindblowing range.  The brownie (wrapped in phyllo dough!) was easily the best brownie I've ever had, and perhaps the most decadent desert I've ever had period.  The service was top notch and also ranks as among the best experiences I've ever had.  This was my first time at Dante, and I think that it may be ahead of Lola and Greenhouse Tavern in my book.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We chose Dante's to celebrate a birthday. Top notch service, excellent cocktails and fantastic food across all four courses. 
Very special night!"}
{"text":"This place is SOLID!  Our group of 4 wanted to keep it light, ( more room for cocktails) so we opted for a couple apps and deserts.  The apps were delicious, BUT the deserts were outstanding!!  Namely the Chocolate peanut butter parfait, and the poached pear.  Unparalleled!  Decor, service, drinks, and food are top notch.  Make a reservation and go!"}
{"text":"Food was fairly good, ambience decent, but finally the evening's pleasure was destroyed by the kitchen's incompetence. Perhaps the server over promised on the ability to service a five course meal alongside a duo of three course meals; the timing issues seem to point to an unfocused chef leading to an undisciplined staff. Once my filet finally arrived, 20 minutes after my previous course and 10 minutes after my fellow diners had finished their entrees, I simply had to send it back to the kitchen to be boxed for take-away. The server to his credit admirably attempted to salvage the night but I must strongly discourage dining at this establishment and certainly will never return to this venue or its sister properties."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was awful! Waiter was impatient and rude.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The tasting menu = a really fun night! The lamb ravioli was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I often start our nights out at the bar here for some wine, cocktails, and/or appetizers.  Food is awesome and bartenders are good people.  I'm always jealous of the old rich looking white people that get to sit in the bank vault though."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant.  I love it's predecessor in Independence.  But there just was something off about it when  we dined there.  I had made reservations and when I arrived was shown to the back of the house near the kitchen.  There were several very nice four tops near the front so I asked to be seated there.  There was no hassle involved or attitude on the part of the hostess, but why not seat us in a nicer location from the start?  We ordered drinks and they were stellar.  Loved my tequila/ St. Germain martini.  Had the carbonara as an appetizer and the charcuterie sampler.  The carbonara is always fabulous.  The charcuterie app was a bit on the meager side, with extremely thin slices of various meats.  As my main I ordered the pork cassoulet.  My partner ordered the entre size of the carbonara.  I asked in advance if it was traditionally made cassoulet, ie: baked low and slow in the oven, and I was assured it was.  When it arrived it was really a deconstructed plate, with a creamy bean base and some slightly rare pork tenderloin and a few slices of sausage.  Not at all a traditional cassoulet.  Very disappointed.  I loved the vibe of the space and the location.  But I won't be rushing back.  It just didn't score a big \"Wow I love this place!\" with me."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Dante, and was very impressed again! Overall, excellent food and reasonably priced. Great service. Main dining room is slightly crowded and perhaps slightly stuffy, but can certainly be overlooked. 

I shared an appetizer size Bolognese and Bass entree with my friend. Perfect amount of food. Very flavorful sauces, perfectly seasoned. Pasta was done just right. 

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I'd come again!"}
{"text":"As a person who eats out nearly every night I see a lot of restaurants and I can tell you that this is in my opinion my favorite. 

To me a restaurant is not just food or drinks or decor or service, the measurement should be how well the restaurant brings all of these together to complete the overall experience.

Dante, has managed to infuse all of these items together. I'll start with the space, a former bank, it has transcended into a fabulous work of art. Keeping the character of the former the restaurant is beautiful and warm and comfortable. It has a vibe that you feel when you walk in the door and are greeted either by Monica (Dante's wife or the General Manager, Branko Kidric (formerly of Ken Stewart's in Akron), both of which make you feel welcome. While waiting for your table to be ready you are offered to wait at the most beautiful bar in Cleveland (certainly the most comfortable stools), where you'll typically be served by the Olesia (Bar Manager), who no matter how busy the place is never appears to be rushed. She works with grace and class. 

Once seated you will be served by one of the professional servers most of which have been with Dante since the inception. All extremely talented and efficient. They are versed in wine pairings as well as suggestions for the most finicky palette. If you prefer you are always welcome to accompany Branko to the wine room to personally select a bottle of fine wine from there well thought out selection.

The food: First the menu changes frequently. My newest favorite is the Yellowtail Hamachi with Yuzu. Accompanied by light tempura okra, avocado and shitake. It is one of the best things I have ever tasted. However, all of their ingredients are high quality and fresh and are always prepared with style, rich with flavor. 

The little things: This is unique in that when you are there you will actually interact with Dante, who is always there. Not only a World Class Chef but also a gentleman who truly appreciates you being there. He will come out to the table, thank you for being there and actually listen to you. In fact on one occasion while I was there I was with a Vegan who mentioned that he did not have any Vegan items on the menu. Not only did Dante prepare a fabulous Vegan Entree for her that evening, on the next menu revision he added Vegan entrees as a selection. To me, that is commendable. 

The team at Dante is always eager to go the extra mile for the guest. I encourage you to make a reservation for your next special occasion, or your next date. You will be impressed. I promise you that. 


Many people write about Michael Symon's restaurants and I will agree that at one time they were great, but that time has passed. His places have the corporate feel of Flemmings or the like."}
{"text":"Great service. Staff friendly and courteous. Nice wine list. The salmon was excellent. The ice cream sorbet dessert will get us back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at Dante today which is unfortunate because after reading Yelp reviews I had high expectations.  Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing?  

The highlight of the meal was the fresh olive bread (I love olive bread) and the obviously homemade ricotta pasta, which had just the right al dente crunch and was really quite perfect !  I also loved the swanky, dimly lit atmosphere.

We also ordered the Seafood Gratin which was served with overcooked scallops, oozing in cream/butter and quite bland.  Uniquely terrible was the polenta, which was a looked like a large glob of paste, and was so saturated with butter, cream and cheese that it was virtually inedible.  The highlight however was the lobster that came with the polenta. While it was slightly overcooked, the portion was quite generous and it was sweet.  Finally, we also had a Bhutanese rice dish which was extremely salty and was basically a big bowl of rice with a little duck confit sprinkled in.

Based on the lovely photos (and reviews) posted by other diners, I may try again, but I'll really be careful to not order anything cream based, dairy based, etc, etc.  And also, I'll remember that portion sizes are quite large !"}
{"text":"Dante, Phil, and his staff are extremely welcoming. Food is tremendous. The tasting menu, along with the chefs table, are a great way to stretch your dollar. Drink prices are pretty reasonable, all things considered. My favorite restaurant in Tremont."}
{"text":"If this place is Italian, I'm Irish. Convinced \"Dante\" changed his name from something Appalachian. Because no self respecting Italian putting what \"Dante\" puts on pasta would call it sauce, they'd call it Chef Boyardee. Luckily, it's in a former bank, so you can pretend you were just robbed. Dare him to feed that drivel to his grandmother, she'd probably reach for her purse and tell him to at least spring for the Prego."}
{"text":"We try to get to Dante whenever we can. The food that he cooks is fantastic. From  the superb house made mortadella to the pastas, risottos and entrees like the salmon or branzino, we have always had a great meal whenever we have gone there for dinner. Also, the late night noodles are outstanding! I can't wait for Ginko to open downstairs!"}
{"text":"My Honey and I were invited to a wedding being held at Dante.  Now, pulling up to Dante, you see the austere front, which is initially intimidating.  Well, set your worries aside, Dante on the inside is warm and inviting.  The private party room has a beautiful wall with the most amazing mosaic detailing and looks out an a beautiful patio.  The service was warm and there wasn't lack for anything.  The food was earthy and easy to eat. I'd read about Dante about 2 years ago, and am so happy to finally have had the opportunity to experience the fine, locally grown fare. You should definitely make the time to visit."}
{"text":"Defuckinglicious shut down the patio the other night w/ a friend very cool staff aswell.  Rabit on summer menu was unreal."}
{"text":"Food: I went here for the Ramen, I have not eaten off their regular menu yet. 
The ramen was a generous portion. My broth (beef) seemed like it was missing something flavor wise, and my dining partner who got the shoyu had broth which was incredibly salty,  although once you got used to the flavor it was good. Apart from the broth, the contents (noodles, pork belly, egg etc) were tasty.  On the whole the ramen is OK. I also got a cocktail which was again, really only ok, especially  for the price . it did not go down very smooth and for $12, well i guess i expect a little more.

Service: We sat at the bar and the bartender was incredibly friendly and attentive. Great service. 

Interior: I love the interior of this place, the architecture is incredible and the vault is a marvel to look at. HOWEVER I do not understand their decorating scheme. The lights are blown glass, abstract pieces of primary colors which are beautiful on their own, but do not fit the art deco feel of the interior. This place has so much potential and the funky light fixtures are throwing everything off. I hope they consider a re-design to truly maximize the beauty of the space they have."}
{"text":"Dante lived up to its stellar reputation.  We had an evening free of kids and activities and enjoyed an elegant dinner out.

We started with the Hawaiian Tuna Tartare.  The combination of flavors was terrific.  I rarely pass up a chance to have beef short ribs and I'm glad I chose that last evening.  It was beautifully presented, tender, and delicious.  My wife had the seared walleye fillet and it was excellent.

The dessert menu looked great but we had left no room.  Next time?"}
{"text":"I brought my GF here on a date a few months back.  Very classy and upscale restaurant... not \"trendy\" like a lot of the other places in Tremont and Ohio City.  Service was great.  Food was amazing.  Wine was fantastic!

I grew up near NYC where food at a restaurant this nice would probably cost double.

Definitely would recommend!  Great restaurant for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and heard good things. I was excited to try Dante. Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience. Poor management. Better time at Lolita across the street"}

{"text":"Dante has the best Italian food in Cleveland, even trumping all of Little Italy. The wait staff was a bit quirky in my opinion, but diligent and helpful. Great atmosphere. The restaurant has a vault in the back from when it used to be a bank. Now used for curing meats, it adds to the authenticity and vibe of the place.

Food is phenomenal, a testament to Dante Boccuzzi's Michelin Star."}
{"text":"First, the full disclosure... part of a private party in the back room, and we \"know people\". So, I'm not saying this was the standard dining experience. So, part the company I was with, and the amazing service from Katie & Phil (Somm) ... food perspective, everything was very very good, but actually nothing stood out. So while several restaurants stand out for me because of an amazing dish or even a few, Dante was more like steady eddy.. everything very very good, nothing blew my mind. From a wine perspective, we were in Phil's hands and boy did he deliver with an AMAZING Amarone (I didn't think I liked those :) ).. as well as an amazing Barbaresco.which I already knew I liked.. we also had champagne and an after dinner drink, both of which I loved without worrying about whether I could ever find those again. Coming back to Katie, if you want great service with a great big smile, she's your lady!!  Great night, can't wait to go back. I will definitely again leave the selections up to Katie & Phil!"}
{"text":"Splurged on the Chef's table and the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings.  Worth every penny.  The courses and pairing were spot on and since the Chef is choosing, you try dishes you normally wouldn't.  I would highly recommend booking the table.  Be prepared the kitchen is much warmer than a normal dining room."}
{"text":"One word.... Awful
We enjoyed the Aps that took an hour to arrive.  
Dinner was also good- but we waited 75 min for it.
Quite frankly- the manger Phil really didn't care."}
{"text":"I'm not even finished my meal and I'm already reviewing this place. Wow. I'm speechless from this Ramen but i'll attempt to put my feelings into words.

The ramen came out pretty darn close to 9:30, given I had been at the restaurant since 8pm. NOTE: RAMEN IS NOT SEEVED UNTIL 9:30 ON WEEKDAYS. So the anticipation mixed with the fantastic red blend of wine from Dante himself, to the hunger in my stomach made the wait worth it in the end. 

Beef broth and ramen noodles is the way to go. Perfectly poached egg, tender and juicy pork, the most flavorful broth I've ever tasted in a ramen. Full shiitake mushroom caps too. I'm blown away by the craftsmanship behind this \"simple\" dish. A must try if in the Cleveland area.

Now back to my meal."}
{"text":"Just an update. Everything is still great! Dante is also mom-approved. She had so much fun fiddling over the menu and choosing which veggie-inspired dishes to try. (She isn't a vegetarian, she just plays one at restaurants. Unless there is something great that catches her eye--in this case, the brick chicken entree.)

New stuff we tried at the table included: pureed carrot soup with ginger foam; summer salad of seven vegetables; linguine carbonara; the \"special\" salad (which had two types of tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, arugula, jalapenos, cucumbers, and a roasted tomato dressing); and the 
brick chicken which was served with spinach, mushrooms, and basil pesto ravioli. Things we ordered last time that were so good we had to try again were the tuna tartar for my husband and the three-cheese 
polenta for me and my mom.

Momz was also quite impressed at her ice cream and sorbet sampler. Each little scoop was served in its own teeny rounded compartment of a larger metal serving dish. It looked like of like a candelabra, and each scoop was garnished with something cool on top. She had four choices out of around eight. She had the toffee and mango ice creams, and the each and dark chocolate sorbets.

I forgot to mention how much I like their bread--they have multigrain, sourdough, and kalamata olive, which they serve with a white-bean hummus and olive oil spread. 

We were again so impressed by the quality of the food and service at Dante. Your meal here could literally be whatever you make of it."}
{"text":"Dante's is one of the finest restaurants around. When you go you'll know why he is showered with accolades. The Pappardelle Bolognese is rivaled only by any pasta dish my Aunt Minnie decides to whip up. The service could have been better, for this type of restaurant with supposedly high standards I expected elite service. The place was packed and had an energy that most places would kill for. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went to Dante for happy hour so I didn't get to try their full on menu. 

I had a martini to drink and we ordered an assortment of appetizers: sushi pops, miso mussels, togarashi fries, and pork belly toban yaki. 

I really enjoyed everything and can't wait to try their dinner menu. Service was great and ambiance was upscale casual."}
{"text":"I was happy to go back to Dante last night since it's been about a year since my last visit.  

First, I have to give kudos to our server, Chris, who was fabulous.  We arrived at 6:25 and he brought us the happy hour menu (HH ends at 6:30).  We were able to order delicious blood orange martinis and a spicy tuna roll at HH prices.  Nice!  And wow, that sushi was some of the best I've ever had.

We decided to order a selection of items to share...

- Oysters- They were excellent.  And Chris recommended Proseco with them so we enjoyed that together.

- Tuna Tartare- Fresh, delicious and a unique presentation with an egg yolk.  Really anything with egg is fabulous.  Soooo good!

- Artichoke Salad- My friend ordered this based on her friend's reco.  I wasn't excited about it until I tasted it.  The blend of flavors was outstanding.  Who knew artichokes could be so tasty. 

- Risotto with Garlic and Tomatoes- All three of us thought this lacked flavor.  We added some pepper to kick it up.

- Polenta with Swiss Chard and Sausage- It's really not fair for me to comment because I don't like the texture of polenta.  I will say this had a really nice flavor.  And the sausage was delicious.

- Bolognese- While it wasn't quite as hot as it could be, the flavor was good.  

- Peanut Butter Parfait- Amazing!  And huge...we didn't even finish it.

All in all a grea night.  I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"They have Schramsberg champagne, great decor and great food! The carbonara was excellent and they cure their own meats. The service was very attentive- I recommend!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant with wonderful fresh, innovative food.  I met an old friend for lunch here when I was back visiting my parents in Ohio.  The decor in the bar is gorgeous... would be a great place to meet up for a drink before heading downtown.

Location is right on the Cuyahoga River. Close to the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad & Cuyahoga Valley National Park & Bike trails (one entrance to these is across the street.)"}
{"text":"Had the chefs whim which was excellent.  Make sure you have time as dinner took 2 hours."}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's best!  Everything on the menu is mouth wateringly delicious. Patio outside is quiet and charming. Best carbonara sauce in town."}
{"text":"1st time at Dante - We were seated at the outdoor patio.  The special drinks were amazing - I had the blueberry bourbon concoction and my wife had a Mojito lookalike.  Dinner was great too - I had the rabbit and my wife had the Mahi-Mahi.  both were unbelievable.  cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"AVOID. We waited 60 mins for 3 appetizers, and had to walk out starving to make a show. Used to be great but digressing at lightening speed. EGREGIOUSLY overpriced, 95 degree summer evening and all hot dishes on menu, no specials, poor service and poor management."}
{"text":"Cannot wait to go back!
We went to Dante for our anniversary dinner and we made reservations weeks in advance to sit at the chef's table. Dante introduced himself and he presented each course to us. We chose to do the experience so we had no idea what food we were getting - we trusted him and he did not let us down! 
Everything was delicious! Our wait staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The general manager came over and greeted us and gave us some information about his other restaurants when we asked - he even offered a personal tour of the 2 next door. 
We ended our meal with dessert - which may have been the best part. We watched the pastry chef all night and were looking forward to her dessert. She brought us a palate cleanser, a dessert then followed by 4 different kinds of homemade ice cream. We loved it!
The kitchen was spotless and they worked like a well oiled machine. We were there from 6-8pm on a Saturday so they were crazy busy but everything was so organized. We never heard 1 staff member complain and not 1 dish came back. It was such a great experience - we look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and nice atmosphere. Food was very good (except the Carbonara which was just adequate). A  bit pricy."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and exceptional service.  Easy 5 star rating on this one...

We decided we would all do the Chef's tasting menu (5 course) with wine.  The food at every step was fantastic.  I don't remember exactly what everything on each tasting plate was, but I will get you close...
1st Course - salmon tartare, green salad, light buttery sauce
2nd course - homemade pasta with crab, tomato slightly spicy
3rd Course - miso cobia (best course of the night)
4th Course - beef tenderloin with cauliflower pur√©e 
5th - various desserts

If the cobia was on the menu next time, I might just get that, but there was not one disappointing item on the tasting menu.  Oh yeah, the wine was great too..."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  Menu is varied, creative, and I love the option of a tasting, appetizer or entree size of some of the menu items.  The sweet potato risotto is a winner...rich!  And the pasta carbonara is equally as rich and utterly delicious.  The pre-selected dessert tasting menu was artfully presented on the plate.  Service is outstanding...attentive without being intrusive.  

The only complaint I have is the acoustics.  We sat in the back room
And when it is seated to capacity it gets loud in there."}
{"text":"Went to Dante for a birthday celebration dinner.  This was my first trip to the Tremont location having been a fairly frequent visitor to the previous Valley View location.  Greeting, seating & service were all great.  Our group found the venue to be annoyingly noisy and uncomfortably lit (a group of late 30 to early 50 year olds using their cellphones to try and light the menus).   I joked that it felt like we were dining in the glow of those annoying yellow bug lightbulbs folks use in the summer!

Our server assisted greatly with navigating the menu & staging the meal.  The soups were all very good.  The pasta course (carbonara & bolognese) were the stars of the evening.  I had the scallops with chorizo which I found to be too heavy on the spice and weirdly plated with mushy, flavorless black lentils that looked more like a gift from my dog vs. a meal component.  One of my friends got the steak - quickly devoured!  The chicken entree received an \"it's ok\" with most of it left on the plate.

Dinner for 4, with two $ 40 bottles of wine, was almost 400 bucks out the door.  As we got into the car, there was a collective sigh with the end of the noise assault.  We all laughed, slammed the doors and headed home.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fine dining in Cleveland. Great ambiance and food. Wonderful pasta and tasting menu - all fresh. Excellent and interesting wine list. Staff is very attentive and knowledgable. I've gone in with and without reservations and always been treated very well unlike some other places in Tremont. No attitude despite the level of dining. I'm vegetarian and especially thankful for the consideration they provide to their herbivore customers! My carnivore friends are all equally pleased as well."}
{"text":"There tonight and the service was horrible.  They dropped off the food at the wrong places and we're unpleasant.  Fine, off night but when they brought the wrong drinks, then charged for them when they weren't drank and gave an incredible attitude for it complaining, I had to call it out here, which I never do for service.  More importantly, the Halibut and burrata was good, but the pasta was horrible, which in their defense seems to be impossible for Italian restaurants to do right.  Brighter note, bread and wine was great."}
{"text":"We went to Dante for my birthday. We both enjoyed the 5 course tasting menu. The first course was a crab salad. It was a nice surprise; I don't normally care for crab. The second course was a delicious ravioli. Next, was an asian inspired scallop dish. My husband had a strip steak, and I had salmon. While these dishes were cooked perfectly, we were a little let down because they didn't taste as unique as the previous dishes.  The dessert course was excellent.  We were given different desserts, and I truly enjoyed the trio that I received. The meal was an experience and a great way to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"Wifey and I decided to cheap out and go to Dante for the Late Night Noodle Menu. Open past midnight and it's also good. Late Night Noodle Menu is happy hour where you choose a combination of noodle and broth. AND they serve Asahi and Kirin for $3... my friends, that alone makes the trip worthwhile.

Choice of noodles: ramen, soba, somen, udon. And you choose any of the broths: beef, miso, pork, shoyu. I would stay away from the ramen and order the udon, which is the safest choice. Can't go wrong with any of the broths. All served with nori, pork belly, mustard greens, shitake, cabbage, and a poached egg. Probably won't be satisfied with the half order, so go with the full.

Also ordered the Black Forbidden Rice, which was good. I like how you can order any appetizer in a half or tasting portion. Definitely interested in trying everything else.

Our server was FANTASTIC - Dante is a classy place. And even though we didn't order the $20 entree like our neighbors, our server made sure we're taken care of and offered high quality service. He definitely took care of us and we showed our appreciation... with better tips.

At the end, they roll out a candy cart station and literally give you a hand full of candies to take home. Plus, it's not the generic kind. Winner."}
{"text":"Dante was an awesome dining experience. Our party was a little confused going in, but our server explained the menu and how the tasting portions work. The food was phenomenal and the service was never hurried, but also not slow. I would recommend this place without a second thought to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best dining experience. Got the Chef's table for a little celebration. Food was delicious and the service very attentive. Desert was a highlight of the evening. 5 starts!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will not be returning to Dantes. My girlfriend I stopped in on a whim, Lolita's next door was booked. We did get seated immediately on a Saturday night, which was a very nice surprise for such a nice place.

Unfortunately our server must have been pretty preoccupied because she was slow getting to our table. At one point, she came over to take our order, I asked a question about the menu, and she left thinking I needed more time to look things over. Not a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that we waited another 10 minutes for her to come back. And another 10-15 minutes after that we finally got our bread (I was quite hangry by that point).

The food was delicious, but I regret my decision to order the marlin (not nearly as tasty as my girlfriends sea scallops). Also wasn't pleased when the bill came, although I knew it was pricey before I walked in. Overall, I left unsatisfied, which is a shame for how much I paid."}
{"text":"WOW! 

I went to Dante this weekend for my birthday and I could not be more pleased with the experience. We had a party of 10 and everyone had a really great time. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the carpaccio appetizer and sea bass for my entree and my wife had the brussels sprouts app and salmon entree. Everything was cooked perfectly and each dish had and exquisite balance of flavors and textures. 

The service was very professional but still friendly and jovial. I wish I remembered our server's name so I could mention him here personally. 
The restaurant itself if beautiful and our entire evening had such a great atmosphere. I'm very happy with my experience at Dante and will be going back again. 

Thank you helping to make my birthday a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Went here with friends while away on business. The food was great. Fresh, well seasoned food, with a nice variety.  I did the quail, that was a special. My 2 hosts had pastas that seemed to be amazing comfort food.  Had a few cocktails that they mix themselves & they were fun & inventive. I would def come back here when in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Dante is a culinary experience. I went here to celebrate with my friends and it was one of most fun dining experience I've had. What I like about Dante is the food is amazing but the entire experience of trying multiple plates is where it gets really fun. I want to try the wine pairing one day and I'm sure it will be amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Server was a little pushy on sales, but service was excellent. Cocktails were excellent."}
{"text":"So I was going to originally go to Ginko, but decided to stop at Dante instead and I'm glad that I did.  The backroom has a nice feel with wood walls and very eclectic artwork.  We started with the mussels that are marinated an excellent concoction with chile peppers, cilantro and buttery crab meat.  These appetizers are very good and the mussels were perfectly steamed.  The portion was large in my opinion for the quality and price (although I was recently in NYC, which may alter my perceptions on quantity).  Nonetheless, these are highly recommended and worth a visit alone.  For the main course, I had the pork tenderloin, which was very juicy and cooked to slightly pink.  The risotto cake was a surprise and paired well with the pork tenderloin.  The braised chanterelles were the stars of the dish and brought everything together.  She had the tuna steak that was seared rare and was complemented by the ginger vinaigrette.  Both main course dishes were excellent... we also had the polenta with balsamic and pork belly that was incredibly rich and very filling.  We had the polenta and several pieces of the pork tenderloin the next day for lunch as there was more food than we cared to eat.  For desert, we had the roasted hazelnut and banana parfait; this was again very rich and well balanced in taste.  I will definitely be back the Dante as this is probably my new favorite restaurant for the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I would give Dante a solid 3.5 stars for the waitstaff, but definitely a 2 for the food, and for me, that's what really counts. I believe in paying good money for good food, but the flavors just weren't there, especially not for the price. I had the scallops, and two of my party members had the polenta and short ribs. The black rice risotto served with the scallops was slimy and pretty inedible. My mother and I split the meal, and after the first bite of risotto, we both decided to avoid it. The presentation on the scallops was pretty, though, and they were happy to split the order for us. As for the short ribs, they tasted underseasoned. One member of our party has a wheat allergy, and she asked that the meal be made gluten-free. Our waiter was awesome about accommodating her, and even found her a gluten-free cider to go with her meal. The weird thing was, without the sauce, which my allergic friend couldn't have, the ribs actually tasted better. 

If you are a beer snoot, as I am, this place has a decent selection of bottles, and a surprising amount of unfiltered and belgian-style beers, so that's a plus. On the other hand, if you know how you like your beer poured, DO NOT LET THEM POUR YOUR BEER! They use tall \"cheat\" glasses to catch all the foam, and they pour it right down the middle. Thankfully, our waiter left the bottle to my Unibroue Fin du Monde, so I was able to pour a little beer back in and swirl it around (as is actually instructed on the bottle) to get to all the unfiltered goodies left in the bottom. Unfortunately, the bad pour still left it flatter than I would have preferred. It was also unfortunate that there didn't seem to be much on tap.

The menu, it must be said, is completely stupid and seriously pretentious. The wine and beer list is well organized and thoughtfully laid out. So why, I must ask, is the menu so incomprehensible? We had to ask the waiter to explain after we had several misunderstandings, and he sounded like he had done this about a million times before. 

The most unforgivable moment, though, was when they brought out our entrees. This place probably would have gotten 3 stars out of me, but none of our meals came at the same time. They brought out our delicate scallops first...cue a three minute wait, and then they brought the regular short ribs...cue a four minute wait, and then FINALLY the gluten free short ribs came. It was clear that the kitchen had their timing off, and rather than refiring the scallops, decided to send them out alone. For almost 30 dollars, I don't expect to have to watch my scallops cool and die on the plate while I wait almost ten minutes to eat them.  Maybe the risotto wouldn't have been so awful if it had still been warm when we started eating.

That said, the patio was a really pleasant space, the waiters were friendly, and the little guitar pick that came at the end of the meal instead of a mint was kind of pretentious (this place looks like it's never seen a live band), but still cute. It wasn't really a bad experience, but I was annoyed by some serious kitchen slip ups and will probably not be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner last week and had a great time.  We sat in the private room in the back with the large square table.  I love how they gave us different options for each courses.  I had the tuna tar tar, scallops, pasta and a cheese plate.  It was SO much food and everything was so rich and fresh.  If I lived here I would be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The short of it: The food is okay, but it's overpriced

The long of it: The atmosphere is lovely.  The restaurant is well designed, beautiful, and has a very cool \"vault\" table.  It's swanky, intimate, and impressive without being pretentious.  We went to celebrate a birthday, and they stuffed 8 of us at a table really designed for 6.  We were bumping elbows, but this restaurant isn't designed to host \"larger\" groups - so we took it in stride.  Overall the service was okay, neither exceptional nor atrocious, although her timing was a little off (we actually had to ask the hostess to find our server so we could place our order).  

A run down of the appetizers: the grilled spanish octopus was by far the best appetizer.  Unique, inspired, and truly a delight.  I would order it again.  We also shared sweet vidalia onion soup (sweet and tasty), risotto with asparagus and morels (creamy, nicely seasoned), and the warm buffalo mozzarella salad (underwhelming).  

Among the table for dinner we ordered the carbonara (better than average, but not \"incredible\"), the double boneless pork chop (beware, this is a large chop, but it was pretty tasty), ribeye steaks (BEWARE, this is a gigantic portion... even the men at the table couldn't finish the cut.  It was definitely not worth the price, and truly didn't taste \"special\"), herb grilled chicken (just okay), and the diver scallops (wonderful, light and filling).

Overall impression... it was expensive for the the experience we had; the tastiest options were the grilled spanish octopus (14) and the diver scallops (28) - but at those prices, we would choose to eat elsewhere.  There is nothing \"wrong\" with the restaurant, you will likely have a lovely time.  But there are better values to be found, especially with all the wonderful restaurants in CLE."}
{"text":"Ate dinner on a weekday night with a party of 6. We all greatly enjoyed the dinner. Firstof all the decor/atmatmosphere was great. Its in an interesting building, a former bank with lots of seating. Inside and outside a back room a table in the old vault etc. The clientele is diverse and fun. Combination of tremont hipsters middle age and older and families. The staff is super professional and friendly.

Menu is varied both in the types of food and also the ordering style. Besides the entrees there are appetizers and small plates and many of the items can be ordered in different sizes: tappas, appetizer or entree size. Provides an opportunity for tasting different things and sharing. Menu changes seasonally. 4 of the 6 of us got duck and were very happy.

 Price is reasonable for creative and very well prepared food in a nice atmosphere. I've never been to tremont before but will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Dante is my favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area. We've dined there too many times to count, and have done multiple chef's tastings there ranging from 5 courses all the way to 21 courses.

Everything from start to finish at Dante is about quality. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and they've brought in some amazing artwork from The Glass Bubble Project in Cleveland. The service is always friendly and knowledgeable, and very high class. You can tell the manager takes pride in not only the quality of the food and the wine but also the service aspect of running the restaurant.

The wine selection is the best in the city, bar none. They have an amazing selection of Italian wines as well as other domestic and international options, at every price point. My recommendation is to let your server guide you to a wine that will pair with your meal - you won't be disappointed as there's not a bad bottle in the bunch.

Finally...the food. Dante continues to create the most perfectly executed plates around. We usually end up doing a four course meal: appetizer, pasta, entree, and dessert. Don't miss the tuna appetizer with the poached egg: it's one of his signature dishes for a reason. Creamy, soft egg oozing over delicate tuna tartar with crispy potatoes....sigh. Heaven. Also not to miss is a sample through his pasta, polenta, and risotto offerings. The pasta is made in house, and my husband declares their Linguine alla Carbonara to be the best he's ever had, and I'd be hard pressed to disagree. On our last visit we had a succulent lamb osso bucco, absolutely falling off of the bone. The unexpected addition of pomegranate seeds made the dish sing!

I'd recommend Dante for any celebratory meal, but certainly wouldn't limit them to just special occasions. We make it at least monthly (sometimes more often!)."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a place. The menu is creative and unique. Not many Ohio restaurants offer skate - which is a type of fish. It was delicate and tasty. The risotto was a little bit of heaven. Different portion sizes were available for every size appetite. Had a \"special\" appetizer that included parmesan custard with roasted mushrooms and olives. Not many healthy choices which is the only reason i did not give 5 stars. Service was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine list. Impressive first date!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Dante. His food is amazing. I have experimented with other local Chefs in the area but Dante blows them out of the water. I have always had wonderful service from his staff. Pairing your dinner with wine was the best experiences for me. Thank you Dante for all you do. You are truly amazing!"}
{"text":"Before I delve into my review, I want to note that I'm pretty sure any diner will find a dish here that they would give 5-stars.  I think Dante is definitely worth trying; you just need to find the dish that works for you.  If you decide to sample many dishes, you're likely to encounter a few duds, though.

I wanted to love Dante, I really did.  After seeing Chef Dante at the Fabulous Food Show, I could hardly want to try his food.  Turns out, I wasn't missing out.

Our evening began with Dante's Sushi Happy Hour.  The boyfriend ordered the Pomegranate Lemonade and I had the Blood Orange Cosmo.  Both were amazing.  We placed an order for the \"Salmon Three Ways\" appetizer which took 40 minutes to arrive.  That's right, FORTY.  And the thing wasn't even good.  It was terribly bland and unoriginal.  I had one piece and was done.  The boyfriend powered through and was more disappointed with each bite.  He kept reiterating that the dish was poorly executed.

We were seated slightly before 5:30 in the vault, which was really neat.  I requested this area after reading other reviews without realizing that it's basically a private dining area.  It's located in front of the charcuterie drying area, which was super cool.

The boyfriend chose the 5-course tasting which included the charcuterie platter, tuna crudo, pasta bolognese, lamb, and chocolate peanut parfait.  I went a-la-carte and ordered the banana butternut squash soup, three-cheese polenta, the chicken, and the brownie dessert.

Bread basket- 4/5 stars. 4 for innovation, 3 for taste.  I love that the bread is served with hummus instead of butter.  I hate that they serve olive bread.  I hate olives.  This is a personal preference, though.

Charcuterie Plate- 4/5 stars.  Dante presented some innovative pates, which were great.  Other selections were bland.  Loved the crispy bread stuff.

Tuna Tartare- 3/5.  Was totally overpowered by the olive remoulade,  The tuna was fresh, though.

Banana butternut squash soup- 3/5.  The cinnamon foam makes it 4/5, but you run out of the foam fast.  Without the foam, no better than a butternut squash soup I can make at home.

Pappardelle Bolognese- 3/5.  I wasn't expecting much from this dish based on others' reviews, but I really enjoyed it.  The boyfriend said he wasn't terribly impressed.  I might be biased because I love pasta.

Three-cheese polenta- 4/5- Super tasty.  The cheeses made it rich and decadent, without it being overpowering.  Still, I felt like something was missing.

New Zealand Lamb- 3/5.  The lamb was perfectly prepared, but the sauce was uninteresting.  Best part of the dish was the tempura pear.

Chicken- 2/5.  Biggest disappointment of the night.  I actually sent it back after about 2 bites.  The menu fails to mention that it's a chicken marsala dish and I HATE marsala.  The chicken was perfectly prepared, but there was so much marsala sauce it completely ruined the dish.  The ravioli were boring.

Chocolate Peanut Parfait- 4/5.  Best dish of the evening.  I wanted to lick the bowl clean.  It includes chocolate mousse, nutella, peanuts, butterfingers, and heaven.  SO good.

Double Baked Chocolate Brownie- 3/5.  Far too sweet.  They wrap the brownie in phyllo dough, then top it with toffee ice cream and caramel.  I thought I was going into diabetic shock after two bites.  It was really good, but too much.  I hate three bites and gave the rest to the BF who loved it (but he loves sweets).

Our server was very nice, and pretty attentive.  Our water glasses unfortunately remained empty for some time.  Still, when I expressed dislike in my entree, he was very accommodating and offered to replace it.  He gave me the option to pick a new dish or have Dante prepare this one differently.   Since I was already full, I passed on the replacement, so he comped the dish.

I loved the atmosphere, too.  It was laid-back, yet classy.  Also very unique.

I would probably only come back to Dante for drinks and desserts.  I'd much rather get my dinner across the street at Lolita."}
{"text":"Tried Dante again and wanted to give them a second chance ..... Dante is an Italian chef who cooks asian fusion dishes . It's just not a good combo . Italian chefs need to cook italian food.  I see that there a lot of good reviews on this restaurant , and I just have to say that I really think a lot of people in CLE are blinded by this restaurant and think it's great for some reason . IT SUCKS !!! Probably one of the worst restaurants in CLE .... And the hostess stand is cluttered with candies . Very strange  . Not a cool place at all"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.  Can I just say delicious? Fabulous? Impressive? Delectable? The service was phenomenal. Super friendly, fast and knowledgeable. The food was SO good. I love the way the menu is laid out. Everything was superb. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We almost walked by the other night without even considering going in (looked super trendy/kind of pretentious), but the funky building (an old bank) drew us in long enough to check out the menu and be pleasantly surprised by what they had. The server at the front could not have been more friendly, so we decided to try it out for dinner that night. 

The prices are actually really reasonable once you realize how much food you get. I'd definitely recommend the risottos (try a few of the tasting size!) and the bacon crusted pork tenderloin! Also, the bartender makes amazing martinis if you're into them!

The patio is great if there's room- I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A great start on fantastic ambiance. Food and wine selection nothing less than inviting. Disappointed that the young staff a bit snobbish at the request for crackers and hits such to go with oysters...redeemed by the fact that they did bring out an alternative and acceptable cracker. Relax Cleveland... It's going to be ok. 2.5 stars was my vote."}
{"text":"Actual rating:3.5 

I'm writing this review purely on the Late Night Noodles. 

First off, I was impressed by the options they had with both the noodles and the broth types (see photo of the menu). They had non-meat based broths, but I went with the ramen option with the pork broth. I love my ramen, so I've been on a mad journey trying to find authentic ramen here in Cleveland. (I am still looking, by the way). The pork broth itself wasn't the typical salty broth that is usually associated with ramen. It had a faint pork flavor but was more watered down (and slightly sweeter) than I expected. I suspect the broth is supposed to be universal for the other types of noodles that they have, like the udon noodles. Added to the ramen was a poached egg, mustard greens, cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, pork belly, and some shredded nori on top. The ramen noodles looked like the dried ramen noodles that you would get at the Asian store. Not as oily as the ones in those Top Ramen packets. I have to say that I really liked the toppings added to the noodles. The egg is runnier than a normal soft boiled egg that ramen has - I would have never put a poached egg and ramen together, but it worked!!! The choice of veggies added a slight bitter taste to the ramen, while the shredded nori added a subtle flavor of seaweed. The shiitake mushrooms had a strong lemon taste to them, as if they had been soaked in lemon juice, which nicely cut the fattiness of the pork belly. The pork belly, by the way, was cut into thinner slices and wasn't overpowering. For those who like spicy, they gave the table the togarashi seasoning. I did add a spoonful or two, but it definitely changes the flavor. 

We came a little after the Late Night Noodles started and were seated right away. When we mentioned that we were there for the noodles, they graciously removed all the extra plates, utensils, and menus. They were quick to take our order (well, we made our choices rather fast out of excitement and hunger). It took about 15 - 20 minutes to get our food once ordered, and the rest was history! I barely had enough time to remember to take a picture of my food before I scarfed it down. 

Overall, I was less than impressed with their version of ramen and the broth - I would not recommend Dante's Late Night Noodles if you are looking for ramen. On the plus side, I didn't leave feeling like I had my week's worth of sodium intake or felt like the pork belly was clogging my arteries as I walked out. I'll have to try different combinations of noodles with broth. For $10 for a full bowl, I would say it is worth it to come back."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, especially the pasta. Service is warm, friendly, and obliging. But where this place really shines -- and unexpectedly -- are the drinks. The bar is fantastic, my whisky sour delicious, and the \"cockpit\" (think chefs table for two, but behind the bar) is very fun."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent drinks, excellent ambience. The rest of the reviews already describe that, so I won't go into it. So why only 4 stars?

I said it was excellent food. My friend and I were intrigued with the late night menu since it seems so out of place and we were rather amused, so we decided to order a small bowl of ramen to sample (on top of our ribeyes, polenta, linguine, dessert).

Well, I don't consider the ramen at this restaurant to be food. As an Asian who has had tens, if not hundreds, of bowls of ramen before, this was the worst one I can remember having. The noodles were maybe of slightly better quality than the dried ones you can get for 50 cents at your local Asian grocery store, the pork broth was too salty, the pork fell apart in the bowl. I ate maybe 2-3 bites. And I always finish my food (or at least take it home). I really couldn't this time. For that, they get -1 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, 5 stars really. I would add a star if I could for the waitress that took care of us (2 tired adults and 2 jet lagged kids)

They have great vegetarian options: the polenta was one of the best i have ever had.  The Wild Mushroom Gratin was flavorful and almost \"crunchy\". The 7 vegetable salad and the eggplant steak were also delicious .

only regret is we could not stay for desserts"}
{"text":"Before I begin my official review, I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with Dante. Almost everything went off without a hitch. 

It was our one year anniversary, and we figured that we'd go a little classier than usual. And because I am both lazy and easily influenced, to yelp I went. Pretty much closed my eyes and used the fickle finger of fate to choose out of the seemingly endless list of good choices. Dante won. And here we are. I made reservations for the vault. (A really really good choice. So intimate, romantic, out of the way...) Because it was our anniversary, we both got surprise glasses of complementary champagne! (Whoo!! Spelled it right on my first try!) We shared an order of calamari. It was very good calamari too... Light, crisp, and flavorful. Definitely a must try. I got the pork with white beans as an entree. Delicious and filling for sure. I almost passed up dessert. But thanks to peer pressure, I gave in and got the Chocolate Peanut Parfait. Sweet, but not too sweet. Loved the banana ice cream! It paired perfectly with the salted caramel. The food, the service, and the atmosphere, all get 5 stars. 

BUT Dante lost a star on one thing, and that's parking. It is horrendous to say the least. I know they have valet, and if we were in any other car we would have used it. Unfortunately, our vehicle of choice is a giant pickup truck. Its already hard to park, and handing the keys over to someone who doesn't know how to handle it and trying to maneuver that monster into that tiny little lot? No way. It was also weird that on a Monday night there was literally NO parking anywhere! We ended up parking almost three quarters of a mile away and hoofing it. Definitely plan ahead when you make a reservation. Come a bit early so you can circle to find a space if you don't feel like paying for valet. 


TL;DR version: Calamari is good, pork is great, service excellent, reservations a must, and parking is chaotic. Great place but plan ahead for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. The atmosphere is definitely more romantic. Excellent service and exceptional food."}
{"text":"I ate at Dante for the 3rd time Saturday night, despite a continuously bumpy ride, the food was excellent. The space is very \"Tremont,\" cool old bank. The menu is interesting with different size portions available on almost every dish. This makes ordering strangely enjoyable. i like the small touches that reflect Dante's love of music. The bread baskets are made out of old vinyl records and he leaves 2 Dante guitar picks with the bill (yes, I took the picks home).

I have tried all of the Risottos, a few salads and the vegetarian special. My family has enjoyed the meat dishes. The presentation on all of the dishes is GREAT!

Ok...Bumpy ride? The service is always a little suspicious at Dante. This was the best of the 3 visits and the waiter was knowledgeable and nice. It was a little strange that they wanted us to wait when we arrived, there were 2 empty tables clearly visible. After we looked at them like they were crazy, they decided to seat us. Don't get me started on Tremont and the ridiculous way restaurants want people to wait to eat when you have a reservation.

We had some issues related to wine (typical) and the manager/co-owner stopped by and took care of the issues. He was nice and very straight forward. This rocky start to the evening was immediately eliminated and we proceeded to have a great dinner.

Highlights? My starter salad was a really nice size for the price and dressed perfectly. It was a surprisingly interesting and enjoyable salad that really wet the palate. Amy had the Hamachi appetizer and the sushi looked spectacular, plump juicy pieces that put them on par with Pacific East (this is a big compliment). I got an appetizer portion of the Cavatelli pasta with fresh Chanterelle mushrooms. The portion was generous and the pasta and mushrooms were perfectly cooked. I'd love to try this with something less creamy and cheesy, it's be great with a simple olive oil and garlic sauce.

Did I mention we got some great wine? A Frog's Leap 2007 Cabernet that was smooth and elegant. It is pricey, but worth the upgrade when you are going to eat a feast. I had the Tempura Tofu which was delicious and presented well. 

Get Dessert! I was stuffed but we shared a parfait with peanuts that everyone raved about. I am not a fan of nuts in my dessert but did enjoy a nutless bite. This is such a huge improvement over the disaster at Lockkeepers, that I am truly happy for Dante. This will not be an easy town for him to be successful in, but his sophomore effort is really delivering. I would give this 4 Stars, but the efforts to make our experience enjoyable have brought this up to 5 Stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose Dante for our anniversary dinner, and I'm so glad we did. It was a great experience from start to finish. 
When we called to make our reservation, we mentioned that it was our anniversary, hoping to grab a table in their super cool vault. The place was packed when we arrived, and I could see that the vault seating was already full...bummer. But I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess lead us not to a table in the front room, which was very noisy, but to a quaint, dimly lit room in the back. There were about ten tables in this room, mostly of couples and it was much quieter and more private than the other room. And it was absolutely beautiful! Think wood walls reminiscent of a cozy cabin and red and yellow light fixtures creating a warming glow. 
Our server was absolutely awesome the entire night. She was obviously very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and took great care of us throughout the meal. Before we even ordered she popped us open a complimentary bottle of prosecco to toast our anniversary, which was such a thoughtful touch. 
We both decided on the 5-course tasting menu with accompanying wine pairings. They also have vegetarian and vegan options of the tasting menu, but we were celebrating so we decided on The Experience. Our server said it was the best way to experience the menu, and made sure to note if we had any allergies or disliked anything. I said I didn't really care for seafood, maybe one seafood course would be okay but please no more, and she assured me that usually only one seafood course is served. 
I can't remember the names of any of the wines, but each wine was brought out and explained extensively before each course, and these were pretty big pours for a tasting menu-I was not complaining about that!! All the pairings were wonderful, complimenting each dish perfectly. 
Our first course was a salmon tartare with apple, white balsamic, and beat pur√©e. It was delicious. Very light with just the perfect vinegary acid from the balsamic. Perfect start. 
Our second course was a homemade pasta in a red sauce with shrimp, mussels and crab. I'm thinking \"didn't I say I don't like seafood\" because they've basically served me the seafood feast on a plate, but that thought disappears when I take my first bite of the delectable homemade pasta. Man, that pasta was delicious. I even ate the mussels, even though I don't like mussels. 
Our third course arrived, and at this point I think I might be getting Punk'd because, you guessed it... Seafood. A seared tuna steak with wilted greens and a miso dumpling. I almost couldn't be mad because it was seriously delicious. I've never had such delicious tuna before. It was seared perfectly, and that miso dumpling gave it a perfectly salty punch. But this is why they only get 4-stars from me. Maybe I didn't assert myself enough when I made my objection to our server, or maybe the kitchen just decided to try to convert me to a seafood lover. Wondering if we are going to be served fish ice cream for dessert is now a joke at our table. 
I'll call the fourth course The Redeemer, because it was just that. It saved this dinner for me. Grilled lamb with roasted asparagus and potatoes in a delicious sauce. WOW! Upon first bite my boyfriend and I just looked at each other and said wow. I would 100% come back just for that dish. 
Next we were given a small palate cleanser of coconut sorbet with a couple citrus segments. Exactly what we needed about the heavier fourth course. 
And then last but not least dessert. I loved that they gave us each a different dessert so we could share. I had a maple banana thing that had about seven components that were all amazing. He had a parfait of apples and ice cream and I think some pretzel. I don't even know. What I do know is we ate all of it and it was delicious. 
We capped off the evening with espresso shot, and couldn't believe when our billed arrived that it had been almost three hours!! Time flies when you're having fun!
I will absolutely be coming back, and I would absolutely order the tasting menu again. It was a perfect celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

I went with my friend (hehe: You know who you are!) to try out Dante's after hearing that it was quite a great place to eat.  Joyce P and I ordered an array of appetizers, and entrees to share, as well as a demi-bottle of red.  Alas, I don't recall the vintage, but it was something merlot based.

Refer to Joyce P's review for a listing of what we had, but I have to highlight a couple things:

1) the Foie Gras was gargantuan.  Do not eat this by yourself unless you know that you're genetically immune to coronary artery disease.  Still, if you're with a group of 3-4, use the shiso and plum to balance the foie gras; you won't be disappointed.

2) The duck sausage has duck.  DUCK!  If you like duck fat, as I do... you'll love the duck sausage.

Decor is unpretentious with an homage to bohemian; reds/burgundies dominate the eyes with accents of bronze-tones.

Excellent find.

Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great menu with a twist.  Had the duck.  Was amazing.   Classy restaurant in a bar crawl part of CLE.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Salt salt salt salt salt. My dish was so over salted we sent it back. Calamari was inedible. My girlfriend sent back her lobster salad. Same thing. Way oversalted. For the price of their food I expect way better. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"Came back here with friends Rachael N and Lin W for Happy Hour. We ended up ordering a LOT of food, somewhat by accident! 

Here's what was great: Black Forbidden Risotto (very flavorful), Linguini alla Carbonara (Poached egg and house made pancetta -- so good, perfect creaminess), 3 salmon sushi (only $4!)

A-OK: Buckwheat spaghetti (handmade pasta is good, but a little lacking in flavor), pappardelle (a little salty), happy hour fries (decent flavor)

Could be better: the tempura chicken wings. Although, props because they were 4 of them and they were HUGE for $4! The flavor and sauce was good; the tempura wasn't fried that well though.

I'll come back for more happy hour sushi!

Also... I just realized that Dante is located in a former bank. We're intrigued by the private dining area in the bank vault!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian and vegan options.  

Pros: The food: the spaghetti with squash, the cauliflower gratin, the banana squash soup, the lemon risotto, the salads were all good.  Bold, adventurous flavors that really mixed well (although the addition of fruit to almost everything was a bit much). The service was incredibly attentive and friendly.

Cons: The decor: I love eating in a former bank, but I don't love eating in a suburban Panera, which is what the interior reminded me of.  Why the huge divider in the middle of the room?  Why the late 90s color scheme? And why, for god's sake, is there a flat screen TV in the place?  Tacky, tacky, tacky.

Overall, though, the food is quite good, and vegetarians and vegans will be very happy.  But the interior designer needs to enter the 21st century."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place.  Its an old bank where you can eat in the safe.  The safe door is still there, was pretty cool.  Happy Hour prices are very good.  The service and food were outstanding.  This is a must see when in Tremont area."}
{"text":"Oh. My. HELL.

Dante was an inferno of judiciously prepared, exquisitely flavored and divinely delectable treats.  Four of us went, three had the special tasting menu (DO IT. PERIOD.) I of course betrayed myself and those around me, deciding to go it alone, be an obstinate troll and order off of the menu.  Fortunately, my choice was not regretted.  The tasting menus may or may not have changed our lives.  My assortment of comestibles was well crafted and overwhelming.

For being upscale, I believe the prices are actual quite reasonable.  $65 for the tasting (5 courses) or I believe $95 if you add in wine pairings throughout.  My 5 courses I picked out for myself came to about $65 as well, plus my drinks, so we all spent maybe $105, and rejoiced in and around our mouths, eyes, ears and intestines.

Our server was Andrew.  He was a blessing.  You should request him.

My SINGULAR complaint.. was... the polenta was served in a horse trough and could have fed a starving family of 5.  I believe that any guest would gladly pay the same price for 1/5 of the portion.  

But, the polenta was great.

TRY DANTE!  Invite happiness into your lives.  (My Moscow Mule was unreasonably delicious)."}
{"text":"Worth the hunt.  Have eaten there thrice and always enjoyed the food and wine. Dishes tried and enjoyed are: Bolognese, salmon, red fish, dayboat scallops, duck, lemon crusted chicken.  Ambiance is nice wait staff are knowledgeable and attentive and you can linger."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that maybe it was an off night.  This is supposed to be one of the stars in Cleveland, but we left unimpressed.   Let's start with the good stuff:   The menu set-up: you can design your courses or go for the fixe and get 5 courses.   I like how you can sample the different pastas and polentas as apps.  The decor--it's in an old bank which has been nicely updated to have two seating areas separated by a long banquet of tables.  Nice art on the wall and interesting lighting.  The service was exceptional--every attention to detail was there.  The drink and wine list was superb--you can have signature mixed drinks (I had the Rattler which consisted of very premium tequila, honey, and rosemary) while also getting your wine on.    The pretty good stuff:  The soups were good--we had a saffron-infused fish soup with little shrimp dumplings and a garlic soup with what seemed like a green pea froth that mixed very nicely with the broth.   We both really enjoyed the soup.   Also pretty good was the appetizers--I ordered the pesto and braised short ribs tasting and was nicely surprised by how large the tasting size was, but also the creaminess the braised ribs yielded onto the pesto--mmmmmm.   The polenta was so so.  Now for the not so good part:  Entrees.  We ordered the balsamic glazed free range chicken with circle pasta and then the salmon with japanese crust and eel on top.  The chicken was very moist, but bland and the balsamic sauce did nothing to increase the flavor profile--the circle pasta reminded me of spaghetti-Os!   The sauce could have had more strength to it--maybe a bit more balsamic and a little more reduction and it would have been better.   The salmon came over-cooked and my partner is very picky when it comes to salmon--medium rare, or rare.   We would almost say that the salmon was medium verging on medium well.  Yikes. It, however, came with a nice, moist rice cake drizzled in a asian red sauce that I thought was really good.   We left the restaurant and upon getting out, both looked at each other and said, \"I was disappointed\".   There are a ton of better restaurants I've tried in the past few months in this foodie city--everyone we have spoken to has given Dante rave reviews...I don't know if I will go back."}
{"text":"Wow, another jewel in Cleveland's dining crown.

Five of us met at Dante last night for an early, pre-concert meal and I left wondering how soon I can get back.

To start, what an interesting, diverse wine list they have and it is great to have so many (maybe twenty?) by the glass options. 

I very much like the way the menu is set up in that it offers different sized portions of almost half of the menu items for one to choose from. I have never been an entree person so I dig this modern menu trend that offers smaller plates of this and that as that is how I enjoy dining. 

We ordered all small plates with one entree exception and every plate was great; there were no disappointing dishes.

I won't go through each plate but of the 10 or so apps/small plates/tasting dishes we had a few were my favorites. I adored the Bhutanese red rice with asparagus and tarragon. I also loved the acini de pepe with wild rice, hazelnut and leeks.  We sampled two of the three polenta offerings and the polenta with braised rabbit was heaven- the polenta itself is enough to make you shake your head for how well it's done and the rabbit braising liquid had a hint of cinnamon that made it sing. 

We all shared a variety of the house made ice creams to finish and each one was well done with great balance and texture. 

I appreciate how much effort was put into using local craftsmen and artisans for the building of the space. The blown glass light fixtures are from local glass shops, the wood paneling and tables were done by local woodworkers and that's just the beginning.

The service was impeccable. Our server was gracious and took care of us in a timely manner and all of the other waitstaff we encountered (bus person, other servers, manager) were friendly and present without being overly so. It was nice to see that the whole staff seemed to really enjoy where they were working and what they were doing. 

One thing I did not enjoy was the noise level. Even though when we started our meal it was early the noise level was already distracting and by the time we left it was painfully loud in the restaurant. I would like to see them take some noise abatement measures as the level of noise was such that I imagine it will keep some people from returning. As it is I would give thought to when I return in hopes that a middle of the week night might not be as loud as the Friday night when we were there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Try the tasting menu and sit at the chef's table and watch dinner be prepared. But save room for dessert, it's amazing and there is lots of it!"}
{"text":"Overrated!  Dinner started out ok.  The drinks were good and came out quickly.  Things SLOWLY went south when I waited over an hour for my meal and it came out cold.  Terribly disappointing, as is the case when a supposedly high end restaurant fails to perform.  There are much better places to eat in Tremont, so I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It is quite expensive. But then again it's one of the best meals I've ever had. The Best of Both Worlds cocktail I highly suggest ordering. It has this chile foam on it that is just the perfect amount of heat with every sip that kind of tingles on your lips then the cool tequila hits. Such a perfect drink. We also had coffee that they brought out in the french press that was the best coffee I've ever had. We had a couple lobster rolls as appetizers that were amazing. Then I had the scallops which were just fall apart perfect with just the right amount of flavor but the scallop itself shining through. We had the s'more parfait dessert which was just as amazing as the rest of the meal. The marshmallow taste in it and the crunchy chocolate... I also enjoyed being here, it could be a place to go when you are dressed to the nines but there were plenty of people in jeans too. We got there a little early for our reservation but were still seated right away. It makes sure that you get the experience you are paying for without being pretentious. There are giant bowls of bubble gum and candy at the host stand too as you leave. And they asked to take our coats as soon as we got in and put them in coat check free.
I'd love to go all the time but with the cost it will be a rare occasion."}
{"text":"Great experience and excellent food & service. Went to Dante on a Friday night and had dinner at the Chef's table. The hostess was welcoming and had us seated very quickly.

Our dinner was a great combination of service and food. Our waitress did an outstanding job in matching and reviewing the wine paring with each course. A few of the items that were selected by the chef would not have been my primary choose if ordering off the menu but I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the progression of the meal. 

The pace of services and food was spot on, enough time between plates without feeling  rushed or forgotten. The price for the 5 course tasting with wine was very reasonable considering the serving size of both plates and pours of wine."}
{"text":"Amazing ness ... Hands down best restaurant in Cleveland... And yeah it's that good"}
{"text":"To describe Dante in a single sentence would be a difficult undertaking - requiring an intricate appreciation for both creativity and culinary mastery within the complex realm of modern nuances.  Dante is a classical, yet eclectic synthesis that blurs the lines between old and new, traditional while at the same time daring and innovative.  Let's begin with the restaurant itself, it is located within the retrofitted interior of a former bank that dates back to the Jazz Age circa 1924, when streetcars still graced American roadways and prohibition was in full swing.  The inside still looks much the same as it did back then, with drop in tin ceiling tiles and an old vault that is now used as a dining area.  

The interior is dimly illuminated, with ample seating and a full bar with a wide ranging alcohol selection.  As for the menu options, they skirt the edges of classical Italian while also incorporating a bit of Japanese flare. The bartender brought out homemade bread with a red hummus spread, which was a nice prelude and tasted delicious! For starters, I had the \"tasting\" portion of the tomato spaghetti, which was a rather small but gratifying sampler dish of handmade pasta with a light blush sauce and squash - amazing!  For the main dish I went with the Verlasso Salmon, an ample portion of well seasoned fish that came on a bed of white beans, mushrooms, and braised in a balsamic vinaigrette.  I must say that it was one of the best tasting salmon dishes I have ever had!  While I opted to skip dessert, I will certainly try it during my next visit.  All in all, for an appetizer, and an entr√©e, the bill came to $39.00, which is not bad considering the quality and quantity of the food.  You don't have to have 20/20 vision to see why Dante is worth a trip, hell, even Ray Charles would see it!"}
{"text":"Dante might be my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Let me break it down for you.
The space itself is great- An old bank turned restaurant. It's romantic but feels \"funky\".... Not pretentiously dressy, which I appreciate. There's a long bar with ample seating, great for grabbing a pre-dinner cocktail (and/or post-dinner cocktail).
The service is always on point. Servers are knowledgeable about both food and wine. In fact, our server on Friday night happened to be a wine and tequila aficionado, so we learned a lot about both of those spirits.... ;)  I will say that there tends to be long \"pauses\" between courses, although I'm not sure if that's due to the service... We had gotten the tasting menu, five courses with wine pairings for $95, and we were at our table for nearly three hours. 
Now let's talk food! Whether you're looking to go all out with a fancy dinner, or you're just craving a bowl of pasta, this place has you covered. Everything I have had is incredible. Dante takes unusual pairings and creates the most harmonious dishes! I feel like the menu is a Japanese/Italian fusion. (Weird, right?) But it works! Also, the items seem to be seasonal and change a few times a year, which I appreciate. However, the carbonara, the pappardelle, and the tuna tartar are always on the menu, for good reason. Oh- one other fun fact- they serve ramen (Yes the noodles!) at the bar late at night.... Can this place get any better?!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful evening at the chef's table with a group of 8.  Service was attentive, helpful and great.  Chef Dante was there himself and was incredibly hospitable. We had a group including vegetarians and non beef eaters and those without restrictions.  The meal was incredibly delicious for everyone.  7 course meal and each one was memorable.  My favorite was spaghetti with basil and artichokes.  Dessert chefs produced an incredible array of dishes for the last course.  A great experience for a celebration and any other special night.  Big fan of the restaurant and the people who work there. Always a wonderful night no matter where you sit or eat."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food because we didn't eat there BUT we did have drinks at the bar .  Actually, we had the most incredible cocktails that have ever passed my lips.  The oh-so-talented mixologist, Dave, concocted several different sublimely delicious beverages.  Each was painstaking created and  resulted in an experience unlike an angel dancing on my tongue.  I would not hesitate to return to Dante to eat...and drink."}
{"text":"Dining at Chef's Table is an experience everyone should try at least once. Setting in the kitchen gives you a new perspective on how a restaurant functions.  Watching how the food is prepared, plated, and served is a joy to behold. We were seated at 8:30 on a Saturday night and were treated to a 7 course tasting that was simply outstanding. Dante was the first to greet us and ask if there were any food preferences or restrictions he should adhere to. He then went about the task of preparing seven dishes that could only be describes as heavenly. He did this while overseeing the kitchen staff and taking every order from the wait staff. We seriously expected yelling, clanging of pots and pans, and an occasional dropped dish. None of that happened. It was a well oiled machine with the staff doing their jobs at a pace that blew us away.  They managed to talk, joke, and prepare the meals effortlessly.  Now let's talk food.  From our appetizer plate to dessert, everything was beautifully prepared, seasoned, and presented. Our server, David, paired wines for each course and did a spot-on job. His knowledge of wine was impressive (I'm a certified wine specialist), and his table side manner was delightful. Even a few jokes thrown in.  I realize that when you're sitting in the kitchen and the chef is paying specific attention to you, that it would be easy to rate them with five stars, but if you break down the evening to just the food and wine, it was still amazing.  I read the other reviews and have this to say. If you don't eat at a restaurant, don't rate it. If it's beyond your means, don't eat there. And never rate a restaurant after one meal. Seeing as how Dante has only been open a short while, it's a credit to Dante and his staff for this fantastic addition to Tremont and Cleveland."}
{"text":"There are many good things about Dante.  The space itself is wonderful.  The converted old bank is a unique setting and it has been restored in a manner that provides an elegant but comfortable dining area. One negative however is that the seating is too close to other tables.  One of our chairs was literally back to back with the table next to us.  I wasn't crazy about the back ground music, but I guess rock is a Dante signature.  It moved away from 80's pop to more blues and got better as the evening progressed.  I had the salmon which was extremely good.  My wife had the prawns and my son had duck.  We were all happy with our meals, but there were no real \"wows\" like I've experienced at higher end restaurants. Deserts were so so.  The 3 chocolate item was a real disappointment and is an item to avoid.  The menu is a bit confusing but once figured out, kind of nice.  You can choose the size of your meal.  You can also mix and match which is a nice feature.  Service was top notch.  Friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  I would do Dante again but there are many other top level restaurants I would go to first."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I celebrated our anniversary of our engagement at Dante's! It was a wonderful night! Keith was our waiter, and he did a great job explaining the menu and offering suggestions, as this was our first time there. He also was very genuine in his interactions, and was always meeting our needs. The food was delicious, we couldn't have had anything better. My fianc√© had the carbonara and I had the salmon. We were offered a desert to celebrate our engagement and it made us feel so special. Thank you Dante's for a beautiful night, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just returned  home from dinner at  Dante. Underwhelmed! My wife and I had  the $110 tasting menu  with  wine pairing.  The two good things I can say were  the servers  service  and wine pairings. Main course was strip steak was tough and tasteless. Scallop course salty and overcooked and rubbery. No course was memorable or even above average. My wife  complained to the waiter and she started a conversation with the women at the table next to us who weren't thrilled with their meals either. Returned home and received an email from opentable saying my  reservation at Dante had been canceled with no explanation. Called the restaurant and Phil the manager said the woman probably hit the wrong button! Ya right! He said he would call opentable to correct.  We'll see."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine for a late night dinner on Thursday. It was the best choice that we made. Being a first timer here, everything was perfect. Food, service, and the knowledge from the waiters were exceptional. 

Decor is classy, dim lighting and intimate inside. However, it does have outside sitting. Being that this place used to be bank, I liked how they used the vault as part of their interior layout. 

For starters, we ordered their mussels and oysters. Oysters were raw so I was at first afraid to try it off my friend but it was the best decision I made. They didn't taste fishy at all, the citrusy /cilantro flavor gave it a nice fresh bite, that makes you want to eat more of them. The mussels had some chili spice in them making them also great to eat. It's like a kick in the mouth but not as spicy as you think. The mussels were cooked perfectly. 

For drinks - they didn't have the drink my friend wanted but they made it for her anyway. It was called the Aviation and all I know that it was filled with some really good green pool of goodness with a nice cherry in the end which was drenched with its liquid. So imagine eating a vodka infused grape! I got their red wine I believe it was Italian. 

For dinner, I ordered their sea bass with gnocchi - my favorite part. The sea bass was pan fried with the skin which tasted tender when you cut through it. My friends ordered their signature dish Tuna Tartare, Beef Short Ribs Polenta, and Carbonara. My friend said the tuna tasted perfect, short ribs were also cooked perfectly (meat was tender. not too dry, and carbonara being its hand made pasta, in my opinion, the noodles were kind of undercooked but overall, experience was wonderful! 

Definitely A+"}
{"text":"Dante is instantly one of the best restaurants in the region. I've been many times already, had several truly memorable meals and virtually no disappointments. 

All of my favorite dishes were part of Chef Boccuzzi's specialized chef's dinners: Salmon crudo, trout with (phenomenal) tomato jam, scallop \"cassoulet\", house cured duck prosciutto, sweet lobster in a rich Newburg style broth. Each of these dishes ranks as one of the tastiest things I've eaten in the period since Dante opened."}
{"text":"A posh staple of Tremont's growing gourmet kingdom. I wasn't sure when I'd have the occasion (and funds) to dine at Dante, but bae pulled through and surprised me with a reservation at the Chef's Table for my birthday! It's aptly named - you're literally taken to a booth style table in the front kitchen to watch as desserts are whipped up, noodles boiled, plates wiped clean, and dishes whisked away by suave runners. Just be ready to smell like kitchen oil by the time the meal is finished.

Chef Boccuzzi needed a vibe and menu to match the old-timey luster of an old bank building. This is the kind of place where waiters scrape away bread crumbs off the table and fold your napkins when you get up to use the restroom. Also, the type of place where you can barely see your neighbors and food unless you're in the kitchen. The setting perhaps also serves to remind that the restaurant has collected a fortune from the price tag on each meal. 

We opted for the 5-course tasting menu so that we could be surprised. And also to reduce the time agonizing over what to order. (You can essentially opt for as many courses as you can eat/pay for, but the most common choices are 5 or 7 courses.) Our waiter for the evening was uber attentive and started us off with some house-made bread and hummus. Both seemed pretty run-of-the-mill, but luckily we were also sipping some excellent prosecco and moscato. 

Our courses:
1. A raw fish (I think sea bass?) delicately arranged on colorful radishes with mushrooms, arugula and orange puree. I'm not much a fan of sashimi or tartare, but this dish was a hit. The two types of mushrooms were the stars of this Instagram-worthy show. 
2. Linguine with pork belly, purple potatoes, and garlic sauce. Knowing Dante's Mediterranean roots, we were really hoping for a pasta dish. However, this one was a let-down. The sauce was pretty bland and the pork too chewy. 
3. Scallops with apple, celery root, and pomegranate. Dante swung gracefully back into our good graces with this home run. I don't think I've ever had such buttery scallops, made even more impressive with the beautiful sear on top. 
4. Quail with prosciutto-wrapped carrot, radish, and mustard seeds. A fun, rich dish. Forever referred to by us as \"tiny chicken\". Watch out for the bones!
4.5 We had been watching the kitchen prepare these little dishes of sorbet and fruit and were joking that if they served this to us as the dessert course, we were leaving. Next thing we knew, two of these plates were set in front of us and I had to struggle not to laugh. Thank goodness, this was only a palate cleanser. 
5. Our lovely waiter actually got us two different desserts, somehow reading our minds as we were watching the kitchen prep and getting us exactly the ones we wanted. I had a layered blueberry and chocolate mousse parfait that I'm sure is the dessert of queens. Our other dessert was a unique brownie of espresso and chocolate-covered banana, with some torched bananas and a sesame seed crisp. This is for the dessert heavyweights, requiring a true dedication to chocolate and sweetness to finish. 

Two hours later we were stuffed with appetizers, 5.5 dishes, and 3 glasses each of wine, and barely able to roll out of the booth. The Chef's Table is a coveted spot at Dante, but also can be an awkward position since you're trying not to make the chefs feel like zoo animals while also wondering what they think of your dining etiquette (or lack thereof). However, it's also one of the best routes to getting a photo with Chef Boccuzzi himself (remember to suck in your post-meal pudge!). Be sure to stop by the giant glass candy bowls and fill your pockets on your way out!"}
{"text":"Outstanding and worth spending an evening.  The food was excellent with great selections!  Awesome for the Vegans!  I had some of the best pasta I have ever eaten in Cleveland.  Awesome wine selection!  The calamari was the best Calamari I have ever had -- a MUST!
The only down side I can say is if you think you can get in and out-- it takes hours -- it's an experience. 
The service was outstanding -- tables are a little to close together -- felt like this party of 4 was eating with us.  It is expensive but worth it -- perfect for the special occasions!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Happy Hour on a Tuesday, we pretty much had the bar to ourselves.  Having the bar and the bartender to ourselves we were able to take a tour of the restaurant!! We saw the kitchen, where the chef's table is located, the wine room, and the smaller 'private' room where you can see the meat being cured.  We had the $5 sushi rolls, both were good, and the $5 martinis were awesome!! Wish we could have gotten more but we were eating else where! Def going back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for valentines dinner.

Made reservation 3-4 weeks before valentines day, ended up sitting in the back room directly next to the kitchen, tabled next to 2 screaming children and a mom/grandfather. happy valentines to us. 

started off with the tuna tartare and mushroom salad...was pretty good, although the egg wasnt done well as it didnt really mix into the tartare, the egg whites just rolled off to the side despite multiple attempts at mixing it in.

wife is a vegetarian, she had the vegan pot pie...dough was dry, vegetables were still a little too raw.

i had the cavatelli with braised pork...was tasty although pasta was boiled too far.

cocktail: negroni...they went crazy on the campari, thats all it tasted like.

I've been to dante many times and its  usually good. was hoping for more, especially for valentines day."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8:15 pm for a party of 6.  We were sat a hour hour late and proceeded to be disappointed by the service for the remainder of our meal.  From drinks to our main course, which we did not receive until 10:30, the delicious food and drinks were not fully appreciated due to the timeliness of the wait staff and kitchen.  Working in the bar/restaurant industry for years I understand that a kitchen can get backed up, but there seemed to be no sense of urgency and there was no apology for the slowness of the entire meal.  The food and drinks themselves were delicious, but my party and I are all in agreement that we will not be back."}
{"text":"Dante did not disappoint. I had high hopes based on previous reviews and I must say, it lived up to the hype. The space itself is very inviting and warm. We sat in the back room, which seemed like an addition to the original space. I enjoyed it- but I wish we would have sat in the front dining room. Our view outside was of the patio which was quaint and super cute.

I had some type of champagne berry drink that was bubbly deliciousness. I could have gotten out of control with them, but limited myself to 2 (after I had a dirty martini- which was just eh.) Our server was very personable and attentive, no complaints as far as service goes- which is always a plus!!

On to the food. OMG the food. First of all, I LOVE the Dante offers different sizes (taste, appetizer, entree.) That is a MAJOR pro for them. It allows you to try different plates without having to waste food or stuff yourself and is perfect for sharing.  I got the appetizer of the 3 cheese polenta followed by an appetizer portion of the linguine. When the polenta came out, I wish I would have been sharing it because it is enough for 1 person to eat as entire meal! They definitely do not skimp. It ended up being a good thing though, because the polenta was the best I have ever had. The consistency was perfect, as well as the flavor. MmMm SO flavorful. At first, I was leery to order it, as I have had it at some places (Lolita) where it is very runny but as I said, the consistency was just what I could have asked for. I ate half and  took half home to my boyfriend who ate it the next day warmed up and was just as good as the night before. When the linguine came out, it was the perfect size and I STILL had some leftover. The dish itself is great- I loved the pancetta bits mixed in and the poached egg. I do however think it could have used a tad more flavor.

Dante is now on my list of go-to places to take family and friends when visiting, or my next date night. I can't wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try !!!! My husband got the chicken with the truffle sauce. He totally is a chicken with the bone person but actually loved his meal !!! I got the salmon and it was amazing. We also got the three cheese polenta and the quinoa risotto while they were great I couldn't help but wonder what the home made pasta tasted like. I love to try home made noodles. They taste so much better then boxed !!!! 

No room for dessert here as our meals were pretty filling."}
{"text":"We sat at the Chef's Table in the main kitchen at Dante. I have to say this was the best date I've ever been on! 

Dante offers a 5, 7,10, or 21 course meal created by Dante himself. You are able to pair the meal with wine, where they bring out a new glass for each course served. The table is set up in the kitchen where you can see food being made, plated, served, and cleaned up. 

Each course is a surprise. I was told that typically for the 5 course meal, a cold salad is served first, followed by a homemade pasta meal, a fish option, a meat option, and then dessert. If you so choose, wine pairings are also decided by the chef for each course. 

Our first course consisted of a salmon salad. Next, homemade ravioli stuffed with chicken was served followed by scallops served over mushroom risotto. Next we had a pork dish and ended the meal with 3 courses of dessert. 

This is a 5-star experience. It is worth EVERY penny spent. Once you try it, you will tell everyone you know that it is a must-do date night."}
{"text":"Deliciously crafted, creatively presented meal. I love the option to choose between 3 portion sizes: tasting, appetizer and entree. Opting for the smaller portion is perfect for sharing family style and even better to make an entree for those that can't choose between all the great menu options. Don't leave without trying the foie gras and steak tartare--- to do for."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Dante.  We were so surprised and excited when we were seated in the vault.  A few minutes after we sat down, our waiter came to our table with two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary! That was so great and we were so surprised again.  Everything after that was just wonderful.  The food and the service was phenomenal.  We will be back and definitely recommend this to everyone! Thank you Dante!"}
{"text":"Dante is GOOD.

I went there on a Friday with my father and it was perfect. I used OpenTable.com to make the reservation and everything went very smoothly. We were even about 15 minutes late (I called, of course) and there were no issues seating us immediately.

The ambiance is dark, inviting and full of life and luster. The food was just phenomenal. We split 3 dishes, black quinoa with pine nuts, Pappardelle Bolognese and the Specialty Fish (Octopus Terrine and Hawaiian Tune Tartare). We had a drink and vino and all in all it came out to about $85. Everything was just wonderful. Our waitress was attentive, kind and helpful. While we did mention it was my 30th b-day it afforded us no extra attention but she did mention it (thanks).

All in all, I really enjoyed it. I won't gush over it but well worth the trip. Go to Dante for a date, a trip with friends or just when you are looking for a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"Dante has been off our list for a while because on prior visits service had been incredibly slow. Gave it another try tonight hoping things improved. Nope. Pasta was good but not much else."}
{"text":"Yet another fabulous date night. My girlfriend and started with tastings of Carbonara, polenta and the special of cavateli with mushroom sauce. 

Entrees were the Sea Scallops for me. Tuna special for my lady.  Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"I love Fahrenheit, I love Lolita, but when someone asks, \"Hey, Chris, what's your favorite Tremont restaurant? \" it's Dante.  

Perhaps comparing Dante, Lolita and Fahrenheit are like comparing Rolls Royce, Bentley and Maybach.  At some point it's all about personal preference, because let's face it, they're all freakin' perfect.
Oh, the horrors of living in Tremont, where I have the terrible problem of where to dine.  

The Linguine alla Carbonara is by far the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  I suddenly realized that if I had to choose a last meal, I'd choose it, and not something my mom had made.  Friends, that is saying something . 

Dante just gets it all right.  Atmosphere?  Perfect.  Service?  Perfect.  Menu?  You need to ask?  Perfect.  The whole place is just so damned comfortable.  All your senses are wrapped in the warmest, cuddliest, softest blanket and coo'd into blissful contentedness.  
When I leave Dante after a meal, I'm always smiling, relaxed, well-fed...  I love it so. 

I read the one-star reviews Dante has gotten and I shake my head. Angry self-loathing people trying to discredit a genuine gift to Cleveland.  

Folks, Dante is in Cleveland's top three restaurants, maybe top 3 in all of Ohio.  Make a reservation, arrive early enough to get some happy hour treats before your table is ready and get ready for a perfect night."}
{"text":"We had reservation for 12 had bump it 15 they were little standoffish but they said ok..   lets start with drinks wine list was awesome and drinks were prompt. We all ordered different apps amazing good . The entre's were awesome we had all types people with us. Food snobs who eat out alot like me and my GF..and people who never go out. Every one with different pallat they all loved the food. Now the piece to put topping on the cake. Desert . wow the robust flavors.  we tried almost all of them YUMMY. Our server was was on the spot with things the atmosphere. was unique and refined. Thank you Dante.....
Michael and Suzy"}
{"text":"The best happy hour in Cleveland. Try the sushi pops! And on your way out grab some candy. :)"}
{"text":"Started the night off waiting for my reservation time (and my date). Had a couple of drinks at the bar. Nice staff, drinks were ok. Met a guy there who is a regular and started chatting. He raved about the Linguine alla Carbonara and ordered it for himself. As a loyal Yelper, I had already planned on ordering it as well, having read the glowing reviews. 

My date arrived, and we ordered the cheese tartlet with figs as an appetizer. It was pretty tasty! Bread at the table was alright. It was served with hummus, which was not that great in either of our opinions. He ordered the rabbit as a main dish at the recommendation of our server. My date had never had rabbit and was keen to try it; I was not previously a rabbit fan, but encouraged him to go for it. It arrived on the bone -- also not my favorite -- but wow, it was delicious! Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found my linguine only ok, for all the raves. (My \"new friend\" from the bar, who happened to be from the south, said it would be his final meal request, if he were on death row. Quite an overstatement, in my opinion.) 

Decor was quite nice and romantic. We were at a corner table in the back room which was mostly taken up by a large birthday party, but they seemed fun and not overbearing for the room. Valet guys were pleasant and appreciated since the area was quite full of street parkers. $6 well spent. 

Would I go back? Maybe, but I'll be more curious to try the spare ribs at Fahrenheit the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place ranks among the top restaurants in my book! Rather its for happy hour or for a special occasion, this place gets my recommendation all the way!

The first visit here was during happy hour. Dante's happy hour has a good selection of food and specialty drinks. I had the toban yaki pork belly, miso mussels, and tasting portion of their ricotta cavatelli (tomato braised lamb) pasta and the French 75 martini. For just $5 each, they were generously portioned and packed with flavor. The pork belly was very tender and was seasoned with just the right amount of soy sauce and salt. The mussels were fresh and the sauce was light with great aroma. The ricotta pasta was also very good with bits of lamb meat. The French 75 (aka Tom Collins) was also pretty good.

I returned here last week to celebrate my gf's birthday. We planned on doing the 5 course tasting menu but we decided to do a la carte since Chef Dante was not at the restaurant. Anyhow, we started with the lobster spring roll as the appetizer. $17 for spring rolls sound steep, but man was it worth it! You get 4 large pieces of spring roll thats stuffed with lobster meat, and all this was topped with more lobster pieces! The spring roll pieces were placed on thin asparagus and truffled mushroom sauce. The rolls were crispy on the outside and the filling was delicious! You can taste the freshness of the lobster meat as well as the truffle sauce. I would order this as my main!

For our main course, I ordered the walleye and she ordered the scallops. The walleye was amazing. Great sear on the skin and cooked nicely throughout. The walleye was fresh and had great flavor. I'm usually a salmon guy, but this was nice for a change. The walleye was served with roasted zucchini, eggplant (bits) and tomato and with light ramp pesto sauce. The scallops were seared with truffle oil and served with a white bean puree. The scallops were large and fresh. No fishy taste or rubbery texture at all. It was perfect. My gf said it was the best scallops she's ever had!

We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The tasting menu is the best way to really experience Dante and what the Michelin starred chef really has to offer. The 5 courses paired with wine was excellent. Ours included the Tuna Tartare, the delicious walnut & spinach Gnocchi, scallops with mushrooms, and perfectly seasoned strip steak. The meal completed with a wonderful selection of about 5 different desserts. Service and atmosphere was top flight. Time spent waiting for our group to arrive in the bar area was also excellent, as the cocktails are both unique, but approachable. The whiskey sour is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Best of Cleveland! Of course, Dante is an upscale restaurant. It is worth to try out for a special occasion. Your partners will love this place if you take them for anniversaries and stuff. (Reservations are recommended). 

I am amazed at this restaurant's creativity. We showed up without a reservation on Saturday night, but of course the restaurant was full. So we waited at bar for about 30 mins til the seating was ready. The bartender, David who workd there are real pro. Every single cocktail he made was superb. 
From the cocktail menu, presentation to its quality, I felt as if I was in a trendy restaurant in West Hollywood. I was very happy.
I truly think that having a skilled, experienced bartender is a huge part of restaurant's success. Always ask for David!

(Appetizers)
\"Hawaian Tuna Tartare\": My partner really loved this dish, which he described as \"Ocean version of Corned beef hash\". The palate was nothing like an ordinary Tuna Tartare but an art like a painting from Comtemporary art museum. The Chef's criativity was clear to see. Dayboat Scallop Gratin was very tasty too.

\"Crispy Calamari and Rock Shrimp\" very good fritto. they are tiny and very light, melts in your mouth. The chilli spicy mayo goes great.

\"Oysters\" Their oysters easily beated lola's. Wow they are so fresh. luv! It's so worth $14 for 6.

\"Dayboat Scallop Gratin\" What I love about this dish is that you get to smell and taste the ocean. The  Holandaise sauce does not kill the freshness of the scallop, which is amazing! It comes with a scallop shelf . This scallop is the best thing in Cleveland.

(Risotto)
\"Carnaroli Heirloom tomato\" Very good simple italian risotto with strong garlic flavor. luv.

\"Black Forbidden Rice\" is our favorite dish of the dinner.This apperizer size risotto is only $5!! But it is not tiny at all. It's got al dente cooked black rice, well seasoned rock shrimp, green onion on top and seasoned perfectly. Every ingredient in the risotto works great with each other.

\"Amaranth, grapes Pancetta\"
Sorry, i did not know what Amaranth was. I order it assuming it would be a rice risotto. Ok, so it is quinoa. 

(Pasta)
\"Linguine alla Carbonara\" The poached egg highlighted the dish. Usually carbonara can be heavy in cream but this one was very light! 

\"Pappardelle Bolognese\" The Pappaardelle, a broad fettuccine, was very nice. This perfectly cooked al dente pasta complimented the ragu sauce.

(Main)
\"Rib-eye steak\" for entree was HUGE! I did say OMG at the table.
It was good but did not beat the rib eye at Lola's.  


*5 course tasting menu($60) is a good deal. 

I visited Dante for the LATE NIGHT NOODLE. We had miso and shoyu ramen. Although the noodle was nothing authentic nor original but an instant noodle, the pork in the soup reminded me of \"Kakuni\" of Japanese cuisine and it was very very soft, quality pork, juicy.  
Lola and Dante are my two favorite restaurants for their style, food presentation, ambience, especially the quality drinks and food.

But I prefer Chef Dante Boccuzzi. I think he is very kind and a nice guy for offering their risotto/pasta as a tasting for $5 and as an appetizer for $9. It is insanely kind of Dante Boccuzzi. 
Plus there are free candies at the door!!"}
{"text":"Tries to cover too many food types and doesn't really pull it off. The duck had too many grains, mussels too much soy sauce, risotto a little bland. Soups were good though.  The place was too dark - everyone used their cell phone flash lights to read menu.  And the place was loud - couldn't hear the person next to me."}
{"text":"Might very well be the best eatery in Cleveland.  We had an absolutely fantastic business dinner for six the other evening.  The food, drinks and service were top shelf!

The atmosphere was also great.

Will return again and look forward to another fine dinning experience.

Much thanks!"}
{"text":"We have gone here twice. The first time was just for appetizers and cocktails. I wish I was able to have stayed for dinner as well. I ordered so many of them that each one just got better than the next. The second was for Valentine's Day. The place was packed and even with all the covers, our food was perfect. Service never skipped a beat. Thumbs up to the staff and management. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The service was elite and out waitress knew the menu like the back of her hand and the food was out of this world. The Hawaiian tuna tartare and all of the pastas are exceptional! Also, the desserts are hand crafted and unbelievably good. Can't wait to come back to Dante."}
{"text":"If you're looking for swanky restaurant with a cool vibe to take someone for a special occasion, put Dante on your list. It will not disappoint, in fact, it will really impress!

Jason and I had a wonderful experience at Dante for our 1 year anniversary! I would give it a 4.5 rating if I could. There were only a few things that seemed a little off, but overall, a fantastic night that makes me want to come back for more!

Jason had made reservations for Dante on a Friday evening, unknowingly the same night as the monthly Tremont Art Walk.  This was perfect for an after dinner stroll through the neighborhood galleries, but bad for parking. We're not opposed to walking at all, but it was near impossible to find a spot within a mile radius of this place. Finally, we spotted a space in a sneaky spot and headed over. I honestly didn't mind the walk either, especially since we got to see everyone out enjoying the gorgeous weather and neighborhood. :-D (If it were the dead of winter, this might be a different story LOL)

We walked in and Dante was a buzzing with people and staff! It seemed a little disorganized at first, but I soon realized it was just the bar that was giving off that vibe. The hostess took our names and told us our table would be up soon and to grab a drink at the bar. Well, the bar was a bit of a zoo...which is cool. I'm used to that. But, it just seemed a little strange for a nice restaurant. The clientele at the bar was a little \"old\" too. Not to be rude by any means, it was just odd to see it getting taken over by 60-65 year olds, wasted. Maybe it's because none of my grandparents drank. 

After waiting for about 15 minutes for our table, we were taken over to a very special, private table in the \"safe\".  For those of you who haven't been to Dante, they renovated an old bank and remodeled the inside. Although you can't see many signs of it, they did leave the safe door on!  This was awesome, to say the least. It was a private, little space with a lot less noise than the rest of Dante. Very intimate. Perfect for our anniversary.  Just a side note: Jason made the reservation online and told them it was our anniversary.  They handpicked that table for us and that's why there was a little wait when we came in. Worth it. 

Now to the food. I have to admit, I don't do well with a lot of choices because I tend to be a little indecisive. Literally, everything on the menu looked divine. I wanted to try everything! Luckily Dante offers tastings of just about half the menu, and these aren't little bites. They bring over a pretty big sample. We usually order things that we both want to try and share them, but this time was really difficult to choose! 

We finally decided on the Braised Artichoke Gratin and a tasting of the Brown Arborio Risotto to start. Both dishes were delicious, but the artichokes were notably better than the risotto. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't as different and memorable as the creamy, goat cheese filled artichokes...yum.  For entrees, Jason chose the Pappardelle Bolognese handmade pasta dish, and I had the Sea Scallops with Potato Strudel.  Again, both dishes were fantastic, but mine was a lot better.  Jason said the pasta was OK, but it seemed likes something he could make at home with the right ingredients. I tasted it and agreed.  The scallops were tender, perfectly cooked and although I was wondering how the chorizo vinaigrette was going to pair, it blew me away. I ended up sharing half of my entree with Jason because I know how much he loves scallops, and I was FULL!

Besides my company and the food, what made this meal for me was our waiter. I don't remember having that great of service in a long time. He was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, funny and cool! He left us just the right amount of time to eat and chat, but didn't ignore us. Perfect timing. Jason and I both also loved that the check wasn't outrageous! (Even though he wouldn't let me pay for anything, I snuck a peak) We skipped on dessert because we were both too full, but we didn't skip on cocktails and that racks up the bill more than anything. But still, very reasonable for such a nice restaurant!

Overall, I love the decor, the vibe, setting and lingering signs that the building used to be a bank. Loved the service, the food was great and the experience overall was fantastic. I'd come back for sure. Down side was a bit of a wait (although for good reason), the bar was a little crazy and loud, and the clientele was a bit odd."}
{"text":"Too much salt in everything.  Horrible.experience and service for the group of 12 of us.  We will never be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Dante on a whim on New Year's Eve. We actually had reservations somewhere else that got cancelled so we were lucky to find a table at Dante. It actually worked out great as the food was worth the price.

We were seated in the backroom which had a nice intimate atmosphere.  Our server was great - she didn't bug us too much and she was very knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the brussel sprouts, butternut squash soup, spaghetti, and apple risotto.  Their menu has some appetizers and entrees, but there are some items that you can order in tasting or entree portions. I liked this because then I could try more food for the same price of ordering an entree.

The brussel sprouts were amazing!  They had honey, butternut squash and ricotta cheese on them.  I can't wait to go back to order it again.

The soup was butternut squash and banana with a cinnamon foam.  It wasn't as thick as other butternut squash soups I've had, but it tasted like fall/winter.

The spaghetti was recommended by the server and it was delicious. The pasta was fresh and it had a little spice to it.

The only item I didn't enjoy was the risotto, but to be fair, the server said it would be more like wild rice which I'm not a fan of.

My husband ordered a pasta dish and the duck - no complaints there either. 

Tremont has a lot of good restaurants - most of which I've been to, but rarely return to. I will be going back to Dante."}
{"text":"With the chef's pedigree, I expected something much better. First, the place is too dark, and would be trendy, if it were 1988. It look like some eighties wall street banker's coke dream in there.

The food is decent, but nowhere near as good as Lolita across the street. The lobster corn chowder was mostly cream. The bacon wrapped foie gras could have been good, but the bacon was burnt and the foie didn't have that nice sear on it. Then I ordered an appetizer sized portion of the carbonara. First of all, the portion is ridiculously large. Second, it wasn't proper carbonara. There was a pool of creamy white sauce, with the poached egg on the bottom. There should be no cream in carbonara - just egg and cheese, with pancetta. If you're going to add cream, don't put that much in!

Service was good, though. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"If I could give a 4.5 I would. Very good restaurant would defiantly dine there again. The service was great. I really loved the caiamari, and the butternut squash and banana puree soup with cinnamon foam was amazing. Excited to have his new restaurants open."}
{"text":"Had an overall positive dining experience.  The layout of the space is very basic:  The restaurant as a whole is divided down the middle by a wall, with the bar on one side and tables on the other.

The table had the five course chef's tasting menu with wine parings.  First up was the charcuterie paired with a Gew√ºrztraminer, which matched perfectly.  My only minor criticism was that the selection of meats was slightly too broad.  I would have a preferred smaller selection with more to sample in each selection in order to get a deeper taste of each individual item.  Otherwise, it all just seems like the same blur as when the waiter goes through identifying each of the meats on the plate upon presentation.

Second was Hawaiian Tuna Tartare.  Ironically, there was an article on Yahoo! yesterday that tuna tartare was losing its cool (being replaced by sashimi) along with cupcake stores and communal tables.  Personally, I thought this was one of the better dishes of the night, particularly when you get just the right mix of the potato crisp, the poached egg, and the tuna in one bite.

Third was handmade pasta.  As there were three of us, the kitchen saw fit to serve us family style with an order of Linguine alla Carbonara, the Pappardelle Bolognese, and the Spaghetti con Pesto.  A nice thought, but, like the charcuterie plate, I really didn't get a grasp of the depth of any of the three pastas.  I ended up leaving the course feeling that each of the dishes were a bit subpar.

Fourth was the Grilled New Zealand Lamb Chops with chick peas and some other items.  The lamb was cooked just right, but nothing about the dish really stood out for me.

Finally, for dessert, I had the Panna Cotta, which I thought was a pretty solid end to the meal.  Of course, I am discounting the cart of dum dum pops, bubble gum, caramel, and other candies that accompanies the check.  Really, besides the \"Hey look!  A gigantic bowl of bubble gum!\" factor, that finish really didn't do anything for me.  I don't give Applebee's points for having a statue of an alligator wearing sunglasses and old license plates adorning their walls.

Overall, I was definitely pleased with Dante and certainly wouldn't mind dining there again.  Three stars probably seems a little too harsh, but I can't bear to elevate it to four star/\"Yay!  I'm a fan!\" status."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what I love most about this place.  It's in an old bank, and I always call ahead to get the vault room - it's just neat sitting back there. 

This is a great place to take friends becaues they offer tasting options on their menu.  You can get an entree, or sample a taste size of a few different offerings.  I've never had a friend leave without truly enjoying their meal."}
{"text":"If you have yet to dine at Dante, I'll give you one great excuse to sample their menu quickly and inexpensively: Happy Hour.

You might have steered clear of Dante for a perceived high price point - if so, you'll be pleased to learn about their $5 and under Happy Hour.  Why not meet up with some friends after work between 4:30-6:30pm to enjoy an array of appetizers (the $4 miso mussels and $3 togarashi french fries are not to be missed) and sip on $5 martinis (my favorite is the Rouge 75) - as if that's not enough reason, did I mention the $4 sushi rolls?  

The service is both formal yet friendly - similar to the elegant yet welcoming vibe of Dante's atmosphere.  The only thing that I would change is the size of the bar, wishing it was was just a little bigger - and because of the area being somewhat limited, I highly suggest arriving at Dante ideally around 5:30pm so you can grab a few seats at the bar, as it does get crowded quickly (for good reason!)."}
{"text":"Came here back in the spring for just a random fancy night out and I still think about this delicious experience! Group of four. All got the chef's tasting of five plates. Server was amazing. Showed us the kitchen and the other restaurants connected to the building. Just all around a wonderful night out with great company, tasty food, and excellent service. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Cleveland!! We had the tasting menu paired with wine. Enjoyed not knowing what to expect next. Each course was better than the last. Worth the price!"}
{"text":"Tried happy hour and It wasn't bad for a $5 meal. Something Yaki. Sizzling plate and all. Didn't have much else. Seat behind the bar is new and seems cool!

The regular menu is good as well. I love the pasta comes in different sizes so you can try a \"sample size\". The foie gras was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Server: Amanda. So knowledgeable and spoke from the heart. You can tell she really loves the restaurant, the chef and menu. On top of everything and we'll timed. Had great recommendations

Visit: Tuesday night, around 6pm

Ambiance: Very artsy. High ceilings, beautiful crown molding. Hint: make a reservation for the vault table. We didn't think ahead but it's so cool looking


Food:
I would definitely come back. I'm interested in what the spring, summer and fall menu tastes like. Winter was extremely innovative yet captured the traditional winter flavors and seasonings. I enjoyed every dish. All fresh as well as flavorful. 
Did had the duck entree. So delicious. Perfectly seasoned. Kudos to the chef for the great wine pairing. Ps. Not  a kid-friendly menu"}
{"text":"5 course chefs tasting dinner. Do it! My fianc√©e and I had dinner on Saturday night with a reservation for the table in the Vault.  She was amazed to see that they offered a gluten free option for the 5 course dinner.  We opted for the wine parings with the courses.  What a perfect dinner, we did not have to decide on a thing, everything was selected for use from the food to the wine.  The service was just as amazing as the food.  A truly special dining experience in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The food is amazing. Chef Dante has won so many awards for his food it's crazy. The setting is really cool inside and outside. Inside the restaurant used to be an old bank, so the bar is all lit up with the gears from the old vault. You can actually can make a reservation to sit in the vault which is really cool! You can also make a reservation to sit at a table in the kitchen which is SO FUN for groups. Service is impeccable, Richard is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We moved to Cleveland two years ago and have been hitting all the big spots but why did it take us two years to find Dante? Our server, Michael, provided us with excellent service. He was attentive without being smothering and provided helpful information about the menu, favorite dishes and the wine selection. His suggestion for a wine by the glass was spot on with the flavors he promised.

We opted to share several smaller dishes rather than entrees and it was a great decision. The mussels were among the best we've had and could easily serve as an entree with a starter salad/soup. The mussels had great spice and flavors and the sauce was so good that I may have been seen dipping my bread in it. Tacky but worth the public shame.  The Bolognese was quite tasty and filling; I would be hard pressed to eat a larger size as the appetizer size shared between two people was quite filling.  We also enjoyed the appetizer special of the day (goat cheese tart?) but it wasn't as pleasing as the regular menu mainstays. I was hoping for something warm and gooey but this was not that - there was nothing wrong with the dish it was simply a personal preference.  We topped of our meal with a shared portion of the Bananas Foster Parfait and it was amazing.

From start to finish our experience with Dante was exceptional and we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I went there twice with my boyfriend and I absolutely love their foods. I also love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Very cozy and nice :)"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Dante it's a wonderful experience! The food is so beautiful and sooo tasty its an easy decision for my husband and I to agree where we're going to have dinner. They have a huge wine selection and also make really good craft cocktails. The charcuterie is soo much better then MOST with delicious moose liver, mortadella and delicious cured salty meats and the food is spot on on! My first experience at Dante was Valentine's Day years ago and our server gave us a complementary tasting size of the carbonara it is literally TO DIE FOR so every time we go we get it every time (still a tasting portion because it's so heavy, but it's literally the best thing in the world) 

Dante is doing it,and doing it right!

{"text":"Went for a family dinner for six people. The bar service was was extremely slow. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks. 
Appetizers where delicious and came out perfect.  The signature porterhouse was not available at 7:30. They ran out. Our main course has not shown up and it's 9:15 has not arrived. 9:18 entrees arrived veal was under done, my wife's petite filet was over done. The polenta was cold and very disappointing. We have been here several times and always have a great meal. Chef thought by serving desert to a table where most don't eat carbs was the best way to say sorry. Not sure if we are going back anytime soon. Chef you might have list us."}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere for a special dining experience for a special occasion, this is a good option.  We were doing that, and were able to get a seat in the bank vault (the restaurant is in a converted bank).  Many menu options, but we went with the tasting menu with wine pairings.  Yes, it is expensive.  Yes, it was one of the most amazing dining experiences I have ever had.  I won't be making this a regular stop, but will be back when I need that over the top experience."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour with my 2 friends and at first sight, I loved the way the place was decorated. As my friend Joyce P pointed out, Dante was originally a bank and they had a somewhat \"private\" dining table where the table was inside the vault-- so adorable!

Their pasta, risotto, and polenta menu offers 3 different sizes-- tasting, appetizers, or ful course. Because we had the option for a tasting size, we ordered about 8 dishes to try.

Delicious Food: Black Forbidden Rice, Linguinie alla Carbonara, and Salmon 3 ways roll, miso mussels. 

Mediocre Food: Pappardalle Bolognese, Cavatelli, French Fries

Not as Good Food: Tempura Chicken Wings

I must rave about the black forbidden risotto rice. I'm usually not a huge fan of risotto but ever since watching Top Chef, I almost try risotto everywhere I go and I finally found a restaurant (Dante) where i truly enjoy riotto! Then, the miso mussels... i love how you don't just taste seafood but also the miso soaked in the mussels. On the other end, the tempura chicken wings weren't so great. The fried batter wasn't so crispty and the chicken didn't have much flavor except the flavor of...chicken.

PROs: the friendly waiter, the speed, the decoration of the place, the quantity of the food (it was soooo much food for $4 per dish!), and the quality of the food. 

CONs: the tempura chicken wings, the small tv where only the people sitting at the bar facing the tv can see it

Overall: This place is a MUST GO. I already know I'm going to be back here fairly soon!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We started with the tomato crab napoleon, which was very fresh. Next we had the oysters on the half shell with a fabulous vinaigrette sauce and had the unusual touch of being sprinkled with black and white sesame seeds. We  Highly recommend the polenta with sausage and the duck entree.  Both were superb! I liked that they used locally made Ohio vodka from watershed distillery. They make a fantastic vodka martini.  Then there's the impeccable service. Many thanks to our server, Branda, who was polite, charming, knowledgeable, and prompt. She left us wanting for nothing!"}
{"text":"Rude, condescending service. No concern for customers' well being and happiness. Had a better time at Lolita and saw some local celebs"}
{"text":"Memorable, but only by what went wrong

I was looking forward to a wonderful dinner at Dante based on a glowing description from a friend who had dined there just a month earlier. Sadly, it was a disappointment on all levels; food, wine and service. 

Despite individual dishes on the menu that looked interesting, we ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Big mistake. Without going into specifics, foods that were mentioned as favorites, and shown on the menu, were not served, though foods that were requested to NOT be served were.  One course was a complete duplicate of the previous course with just a change of the type of meat placed on top of the vegetables. Excuses were made, but only by a rueful waitress, not the chef or manager. 

I could go on and on, but it's not worth the effort since the kitchen couldn't make the effort to serve a dinner worthy of the price they charged."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I just can't. I will start by saying that the food is quite good. That being said, each time that I have been there (3) I leave feeling upset. The service is just plain poor and at a restaurant in this price range that should NEVER be the case. The servers have all been very nice but totally unattentive. I don't know if they have too many tables to serve or what but they are never around except to take an order. Also, while the food is quite tasty, as previously said, some of the portions can be comically small. We had a duck appetizer this past weekend that seriously had less than 1 ounce of duck in it. Again, for what the final tab is at Dante they really should be a better run restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars, because this is a 2.5 but not a 3. We walked in on a Friday night without reservations and were offered seating on the patio, which is a lovely space and very pleasant. Our waiter was attentive, and when one of our party mentioned that she was allergic to wheat, he made sure to note this on her order even after helping her identify a menu item he thought was wheat free. Sure enough, this proved to be a good thing because the kitchen adjusted her polenta and omitted a sauce that would have caused problems. He also made a special trip to the bar to ask about wheat-free beers, and was able to offer her a beverage that she enjoyed.

He didn't, however, understand how to pour an unfiltered beer, and despite my daughter attempting to politely intervene in his pouring of her beer ignored her. A small error, but not unforgivable.

Most of the problems came from the kitchen. The appetizers were quite good. Daughter and I split the goat cheese fritter salad, which had a very nice combination of a mild and sweet goat cheese and the bitter snap of frisee. The braised greens were flavorful, and hubby enjoyed his pasta.

Things fell apart a little with our main courses. Daughter and I split an order of the scallops over black risotto, and Hubby and our friend each had the polenta with braised short ribs. Our scallops arrived at the table, but the polentas were nowhere to be seen. It was at least 5 minutes before the polentas arrived, which says to me that someone in the kitchen fired the scallops much too early, and instead of dealing with the mistake in the kitchen, they brought them out to our table to quietly die while we waited for the rest of the party to be served. A delay of a minute is tolerable; this delay was ridiculous.

The scallops, once we did get to eat them, were well-cooked, but one of them still had a considerable amount of grit. Neither Daughter nor I liked the risotto, which had a slimy texture. Our guest liked her gluten-free braised ribs and polenta, but Hubby was not happy with his. I tasted the two different polentas, and honestly I think the gluten-free one, without the addition of some sort of bechamel sauce, had a better taste and mouth-feel.

On the whole, the ambiance of the place is very nice, but I will not be in any hurry to visit again"}
{"text":"Very good food. Place n service was nice. As some reviews mentioned the food took a while to come but I'm guessing they prepare everything fresh as it tasted great. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Dante's and we absolutely LoVeD it!   The energy is electric, the staff is uber friendly and ready to please you and it's just cool inside with that big bank vault.  I'm on a doctor restricted diet and figured I'd have to find a way to work around the menu, but to my pleasant surprise, not so!  Dante's offers several tasting menus and I asked our server, Katie, if the chef would be able to accommodate me and without hesitation she replied absolutely!  None of this, oh let me go check stuff, it was just yes.  She asked what I was not allowed to have and reported that to the chef and my meal was every bit as delicious and beautifully displayed as everyone else's at my table.  The sommelier, Phil, was knowledgeable and excited about the wines he paired with the courses.  After our dinner, which was a relaxing 3 hour experience, Phil gave us a tour of the restaurant and the kitchen, showed off the Chef's table and introduced us to Chef and Owner Dante.  Great Food! Great Time! We'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"Went there over the holidays with a group of friends, and the meal was wonderful. A couple of the pasta dishes were as good as any I've ever had, the charcuterie board was righteous, wine list was better than average, and everyone enjoyed their mains and sides. Service was knowledgeable and friendly, and atmosphere was nice. Certainly one of the better dining options in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Perfect for a fun night out with friends. In fact, get a group together (go fashion forward here, folks!). After happy hour somewhere else in Tremont, say 806, head to Dante. Sit at the bar and order a range of dishes (many items come in various sizes, such as Tasting, Appetizer or Entree so you can sample. My favorites: the polenta and the strawberry balsamic risotto!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Elegant & our waitstaff was extremely attentive! We ordered the honey roasted Brussel Sprouts & the maple glazed pork belly polenta - both were delicious! I would 100% order the polenta again & again! For our meals we ordered Pappardelle Bolognese & the Branzino - the pasta was loaded with flavor & delicious! Now I'll be honest.. I didn't pay attention to what I ordered (the Branzino) just saw filet & our server  said it's one of her favorites! I don't eat fish... but ate every bite! So that shows just how good it was! 

A elegant beautiful delicious dining experience!"}
{"text":"YYYYYYYYYuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmm.... Went for Valentine's Day. I can't say enough about this place. The food is extraordinary and the drinks from bartender Paul Norris are creative, edgy and fantastic. The thing I didn't like is that we were packed in there like sardines...I know it was Valentine's Day - but part of the reason we frequent there is for the intimate experience and ambiance. I think I heard every detail of our neighboring diner's \"evening plans.\" It seems as though some other yelpers share in my thoughts. I will go back for their perfectly el dente farfalle any day..."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Dante to celebrate a special occasion and absolutely loved it!! The ambiance is really intimate and my friend and I were seated in a corner so we could catch up appropriately and still receive personalized service. First, we ordered the Double Goat Cheese Tartlet. I loved it because goat cheese is my favorite cheese and the pear chutney complemented the bold flavor of the cheese perfectly. We also ordered the Three Cheese Polenta and it had just the right touch of boldness but was not too heavy. The cheeses tasted wonderful together, which is slightly surprising since it was a rather unique three cheese blend. My friend and I shared our entrees with each other. We each ordered an appetizer portion of pasta and split them. This was more than enough food for both of us! We ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara (minus pancetta) and one of the weekly pasta specials.  The poached egg on the Linguine was easily the best part of the dish and made it very filling even though it was an appetizer size. Both kinds of pasta looked really similar when they were served to us, but they were unique and dynamic! Overall, I loved this place so much. This is food you I cannot find at many other restaurants, nor it is something I can make at home myself. Well worth the money. Also, since we ordered many appetizers, the total cost of the meal was not too high at all!"}
{"text":"Tasting menu is the way to go!

This place is fantastic! Michelin starred chef, Michelin starred food! Experience is what you expect from a high end restaurant but without paying NYC prices. Everything is fantastic, I would strongly suggest having the tasting menu. It is not expensive and you get to try several different things. They have excellent wines by the glass not found in other places.

It is an outstanding experience, everyone should come here whatever special occasion it is!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service an I enjoyed the entire dinning experience."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for out drink order, we were just about to get up when they came.  We decided to stay and the food took 2 hours. We complained and the food finally cam out and they did comp our meal.  Food was good but not worth that hassle.  Will not come back"}
{"text":"Best filet I've had in Cleveland, over Red, Moxie, Flemings - it's not just steak it's steak paired with amazing gravy infused Swiss chard and wild morels.  I recommend splitting an entree and going with a few different pasta tastings. Amazing."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the 2nd time in the last 6 months,  and was as disappointed this time as I was the  last. The food is tasty and the value ok. I recommend the tasting portions of risotto or the pastas.  The calamari was ok, just not strong enough to differentiate from other fried squid. The lobster spring rolls are also ok, just a big taste of oil and a bit of lobster.

As for mains, the ribeye was good, and the current chicken is full of truffle scent but lacking in flavor. The duck was good, but smoked to the point that it tasted too much like a slab of bacon.

As for desserts, well, we didn't get to those and not because we didn't want them.  My major issue with this place is the HORRIBLE service. Our waitress disappeared 3 times tonight for over 20 minutes each time. First it was after we ordered our appetizer.  Second was after they brought the wrong soup and there was literally zero employees in the dining room for 10 minutes and we finally got her after the rest of our group had already finished their appetizers. Then, after we received the dessert menus she again disappeared. Not wanting to sit in a half empty reataurant until 2 am on a Wednesday,  we decided to cut our losses and just get the bill.

My recommendation is to go elsewhere. Today's dining experience is just as much about the service and experience as it is about the food."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience.  From the first course through dessert, this restaurant proved exceptional.  The foie gras is outstanding - buttery and mild with beautifully balanced accoutrements.  The cream infused mozzerella was rich and tasty.  I could eat it weekly.  Though the ribeye, the forbidden black rice, and the sweet bread polenta were all beautifully executed and delicious, even they could not stand up to the pasta carbonara.  And I don't typically care for pasta.  Oh, and the creme brulee, with sweet phyllo strands and passion fruit shot.  I normally order a more challenging dessert, but I was already stuffed, and I was absolutely wowed by this dish.  

The service was impeccable, the cocktails and wine list were very good.  This was truly one of the best meals I have had in Cleveland.  Great job, Dante!  Now if Tremont could just solve the parking situation... :)"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was dreadful. Make sure you dedicate 3+ hours to your dining experience and you won't be upset. My party of 5 was seated 35 minutes after our 8:15 reservation time, which is okay but at least acknowledge that you've kept us waiting until almost 9:00 for a table. Once seated we waited almost 30 minutes for our bread! Wouldn't you think to immediately bring out anything to eat for the starving guests who now likely won't eat until after 10:00?! An appetizer was forgotten, food was brought to the wrong people, and we finally got our main course around 10:30. Waitress was nice and our deserts and coffee were comped but by that point it was almost 11:30 and we just wanted to get the hell out of there. I am usually a very patient and understanding guest (having worked in the food industry for 5 years) but I will definitely not be going back. Ruined the mood of the entire evening for the guests I was entertaining from out of town."}
{"text":"Within one week in Cleveland, the BF and I came here twice.  Does that say enough or should I elaborate?  I'll elaborate so you can drool over our spectacular evenings. 

Dante offers a dark and intimate decor.  Perfect for romancing someone new or enjoying an evening out with the love of your life.  The dark wood interior with fun lighting sets the mood for a spectacular time. 

Our first outing was late and we were looking for a libation or two and something sweet to complete our evening.  There cocktail list is well constructed and has a little bit of something for everyone.  I can't remember the specific cocktails at this time but I can tell you that they were all exceptional.  Once we took a glance at the dessert menu we knew we had to have something.  Decisions are difficult when everything calls out your name.  Dante must know that decisions cannot be made for only one dessert so they offer a tasting menu option for three desserts ($18).  We're sold!  We'll have the, Peanut Butter Banana Cheesecake, Blueberry Lemon Parfait, and the Raspberry Tartlet please.  The standout by far was the Peanut Butter Banana Cheesecake.  The peanut butter and banana combination in the Cheesecake is genius.  Add on chocolate covered pretzels and rocky road ice cream for the full effect and each bite is ecstasy.  The other two offerings were impressive as well.  I enjoyed the tart flavor offered in the Raspberry Tartlet with the citrus cream.  We moaned and groaned with each heavenly bite and cleaned each plate.  

A day or two had passed and we were still talking about our wonderful time so when we opted to go on a culinary adventure in Tremont we decided that Dante would be on the list of stops.

A dinner stop was just what we needed after enjoying sushi from Ginko next door.  Another night sitting at the bar, our favorite place to enjoy the atmosphere at Dante.  More cocktails were enjoyed as we discussed the delicious looking menu.  The BF let me decide and surprise him with what we were having for dinner.  Again, because I can't choose, I decided on all three Hand Made Past dishes, a tasting of each at $5 a piece.  For a tasting portion we both thought these were very large servings.  We had the Linguine alla Carbonara, Pappardelle Bolognese, and the Ricotta Cavatelli alla Norma.  Our favorite was the Bolognese with a ragu of beef, veal, and pork.  The combination of flavors were brilliant and the hand made pasta was divine.  The Carbonara also stood out as we twirled our forks around collecting each strand of linguine with pancetta and a rich cream sauce that coated each luscious fork full.

In addition, I left feedback on one of those cards for the Chef and not a week or two later I received a hand written letter in the mail thanking me for coming and for the feedback.  A very nice touch indeed.  

I found Dante to be a dynamite restaurant with an innovative cocktail list and stunning menu.  I would gladly return time and time again to enjoy this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Cool Tremont fancy place. Great service, wine list, and well appointed menu with chef power galore. Dante takes care to be sure. Calamari was superb. Mushroom soup was perfectly done, I was told. You can opt for the full lobe of fois gras ($150 feeds six). Tempting, but we are on a budget, for now. Next time we may try a dessert or two."}
{"text":"Last night we celebrated our 50th Anniversary with a visit to this restaurant for the first time based on the Yelp reviews. The outstanding ratings were totally justified. The Tuna Tartare appetizer, which we shared, was elegant and delicious. My husband loved the Verlasso Salmon with the delicate horseradish crunch entree and I loved the Filet Mignon, garlic potato gratin, oyster mushrooms, sauteed spinach, truffle essence. The desserts were scrumptious!  The service was cordial and relaxed.  This is definitely our new favorite Cleveland restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Wonderful service. Tasting menu is the way to go : it adds a great \"surprise\" element to the experience. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"This place is damn near perfect. It has a perfect location. Next to my favorite bar (Tree House) and in front of my favorite store (banyan tree). I am madly in love with treemont so I am a bit bias.  
I will start with the bad part first. The hostesses were good to fit us right in with our reservations (wait that wasnt bad )However they walked us thru the kitchen which I can live with but it was a bit messy. Reminded  me of Monica's messy closet in friends. House was perfect but she had a messy closet. Another thing I didn't like was the table. Was annoyingly small. Between the two plates and the wine glasses there was no room.
Now the good part. The food was amazing! The menu was small but so versatile.  There were so many options. Definitely an Italian cuisine but with a great contemporary twist. I got the scallops and my friend got the salmon. They were made by the Italian gods of seafood. Meravillioso!!!
You know those food shows on TV where the stupid chefs eat the food and explain it and you have no idea how great it is because you didn't taste it? It would be like that. I can tell you how great it is but you won't know till you go in and try it."}
{"text":"Dante Boccuzzi. He probably doesn't get as much notoriety in the CLE food scene as he should. Dante's social media presence isn't as strong as other celebrity chefs in this town. His restaurant isn't overwhelmed with hipster foodies who seem to have an ever growing voice in the local culinary scene. He hasn't yet challenged Bobby Flay to a throwdown, he hasn't authored a cook book and he he doesn't conduct many interviews. You see, while all the other chefs you hear about on TV and print media are running around, seeminly with all the time in the world trying to build their image, Chef Boccuzzi is in the kitchen with his chef's whites on and sleeves rolled up. He's working on not building an image, but perfecting his cuisine. 

If you need more proof that Dante is a well trained master of his craft, other than the glowing review that is about to follow, check his r√©sum√©. He's been classically trained at the CIA, has traveled around the world and has worked in some of the best restaurants in Italy, France, Hong Kong, San Fran and NYC. His mentors include Charlie Palmer and  \"NOBU\" Yuki Mastsuhisa. None of this, btw, I knew of before I recently dined in Restaurant Dante on three separate occasions, all within the last month. Following my love fest for what followed on these three nights, I was intrigued to find out more. It all makes sense now. Compliments to the chef! 

The first visit was with friends. We sat on the courtyard patio. We came here on a tip. After stuffing ourselves during a Lolita happy hour, we pried the bartender for a recommendation in the area for dessert. He didn't think twice. \"Dante\", he said. And Dante it was. A Chocolate Peanut Parfait and a Jar of Creme Br√ªl√©e later, we were in love. Words can't do this work of art justice. See my pictures as proof. It was as good as the images suggest. Better even. 

The second visit was on a random Friday night. With help and a very detailed introduction by our waiter, we ordered several courses. The menu is divided into 3 sections. Lighter bites (salad, fish and charcuterie). You can see the cured meat hanging behind a glass window through \"the vault\" (more on that later). The second section of the menu consists of starches. All of which can be ordered as a tasting, appetizer or main. The final part of the menu consists of entr√©e items, all anchored by meat, game or a substantial fish.

On this night, we ordered the mussels. The highlight of this dish was the broth. It almost reminded me of veal stock. Silky, robust and meaty. It was so good, we slurped the bowl dry after the mussels were gone, one spoon-full at a time until there wasn't a drop left. Next, I ordered a tasting of the Linguine Carbonara with poached egg and house made pancetta. The tasting was a 4oz portion, which was perfect. The pasta came topped with a masterfully done poached egg, which I broke and scattered over the pasta. That and the salty cured meat made this dish heaven. Next, I opted for the Pepper Crusted Duck with toasted basmati, shitake, scallions and ginger mango vinaigrette. Again, heaven. For dessert, this time we shared the Chilled Lemon Souffle with toasted coconut, pineapple and margarita sorbe. Whoever does the pastries at this place is an artist. Colorful and abstractly presented. It was flawless and so was the flavor. 

Our third trip was our most recent one. We came for the happy hour. Sushi Rolls of spicy tuna and salmon three ways (raw, roe and skin) were ordered. As were an order of Edamame and Miso Mussels. All washed down with several martinis. The bill? A modest $30 and some change. A deal unlike any other in town. Now onto the sushi. It clearly was the best either one of us has had in the city. And not even by a close margin either. There's been a asterisk on the food scene in Cleveland for quite a while. It's a great food scene, mind you, sans the Sushi. Good sushi was previously non existent in this town. Not anymore. Dante, clearly has it down. And this makes me anticipate the soon to be opened modern Japanese restaurant Ginko, located in the basement of Dante, all the more.

The food was divine and the service impeccable. That much is certain. But what also sets this place apart is the atmosphere. The space is a former bank. There's even a table set inside a vault. It's great to see how they were able to reuse some of the aspects of the previous space when transforming it into a restaurant. The crowd seems a little more refined than some of the other eateries around town. With that said, it's still very approachable and not too stuffy. 

In summarizing my experiences with Dante, I am excited to say, Cleveland does indeed have another gem on their hands. I was so blown away on my three recent trips here, I am adding it to my coveted Top 3 in the CLE list and bumping Greenhouse Tavern."}
{"text":"Five stars! My husband and I were out celebrating a special occasion recently so we thought we would do the \"Chef's Special\". Absolutely worth it! We were both very hungry and were fully satisfied at the end of the meal. I was so full by the time dessert came that I was only able to take a few bites. 

I can't eat raw fish at the moment so the chef changed his raw salmon appetizer that he made for my husband, and I received a caprese salad which was so good! Next came a pasta dish in a truffle sauce. The pasta itself was made in house and you can tell! Just perfect! Next up was the fish entree which were scallops in a sauce that was, again, delicious! Then came the meat entree which was a filet in a tomato sauce with a side of polenta. And it was, you guessed it, delicious! Everything was just so so so good. I can't even pick a favorite. If you want to splurge on a well prepared and perfectly cooked and delicious meal, I highly recommend the Chef's Special!"}
{"text":"Great & Excellent Food and the wait staff is kind and Polite.  The food is delicious and excellent.  Portions are large as well one can always share around the table.

The only thing I didn't like about this place - it's right across from the FUNERAL HOME.  I know, it's part of life - I rather not be wining and dining and having fun across from the funeral home.  It didn't feel right.

Also, this place is in an old historic building (I think) - the building use to be a bank back in the day and beautiful building and setting.  But the FUNERAL Home was my BIG turn-off :-(

I was with a group and they decided to go there and not knowing the surroundings I joined in.

Will I go back - NO - reason - Funeral Home across from Dante."}
{"text":"Food was very good however service was not. We had a reservation on a Friday night and sat at a high table in the bar area. We would think we would get a dedicated waiter, but every time someone came to our table, it was a different person. We asked multiple times for a steady waiter, instead of having them just all \"tag team\" and after the 3 or 4th time asking we have a steady waiter. After a while of figuring that out, we were able to order our appetizer (oysters), which took forever and when it finally got to table it was wrong. They took it back and brought out a different complimentary app (tuna tartar), which was nice, but the oysters still took even more time to come out. When we finally ordered dinner, we ordered a 2 soups, a risotta, their seabass and steak. Each dish took over a half hour or more to come. We were so starving in between each plate as it just took so long - the 2 of us were there over 3 hours. We also ordered dessert and that even took a long time. 

We kept mentioning how we were a bit dissatisfied, and you would think they would step their game up but they did not. Unfortunately, the bad service overshadowed the food."}
{"text":"Still looking for a Cleveland-area restaurant that rivals Lolita.

This was not it.  The service was very good and the space is GORGEOUS!  The prices are very reasonable.

But the food was average.  The best part was the amuse-bouche of cauliflower and bacon soup (delicious).  We ordered the charcuterie plate and an onion and goat cheese tart for appetizers.  The charcuterie was good; the highlight for me was the duck proscuitto.   I'll take Lolita's version any day though.  The goat cheese tart was delicous but pitifully small.

Entrees were well-portioned.  Most of us got pasta, and we were all disappointed.  One person got steak, which was the best dish by far.  Sides were average - fried macaroni and cheese sounded amazing but was mostly just a really thick coating of breading around a little bit of tasteless mac and cheese.  The brussels sprouts with pancetta were good (but hard to screw up, too)."}
{"text":"I loved the food!!!!!! My favorite drink is \"Moscow Mule\". It was very refreshing with lemon and ginger Flavors.

Felt I should not have gone for the wine pairing (personally) only because it was too much of wine for me . Otherwise , the wine they offered was filled with lot of variety . However, the pairing could have been better.  

We tried from the pre-fixed chef tasting menu. Our waitress was very considerate to let us pick almost anything from the menu to match our preferences. I guess because my husband and I are mostly vegetarians. 

I tried Banana Butternut Squash soup. Like some yelper had mentioned it was really fantastic. Indeed it was mindblowing. I tried their shrimp and calamari ... Then , I tried tempura style portobello mushrooms and of course, Hawaiian tuna tartare ( how could I miss after trying at DBA ) . 

The dessert was baklava with pistachio ice cream/ 

Overall,  I was very very satisfied with the food. Everything tasted exceptionally good . Suggest for even strict vegetarians. They also have options for vegans too. This place had choices for everyone !  Amazing chef. 

-4 stars only because I wish there were more waiters just like how they were in DBA to focus on each table . Because most of the high end restaurants offer an extra ordinary service and therefore , usual expectations are high ."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience at Dante celebrating our anniversary.  If you haven't been, it's inside of an old bank in Tremont and is well appointed, cool and modern.  It had been several years since we had been and we weren't very impressed either time we went.  Admittedly, one of those times was a NYE dinner and restaurants shouldn't be judged on new years for many reasons.  Anyways, the bread on the table is fantastic and the hummus that comes with it is a nice touch.  We started with oysters and an appetizer portion of the gnocchi.  Both were wonderful.  The oysters were huge and meaty.  The gnocchi was my favorite dish of the evening, tender and delicious.  For entrees I had the tandoori rubbed eggplant which was very tasty, but the eggplant could have been cooked a bit longer as it was a bit too hard.  The husband had the coq au vin, which he said was very good, but said it was a bit uneven as some of the chicken had the wine flavor and some did not.  The service was great and we were sat next to the door of the vault which was a nice conversation piece and something to stare at during the lulls.  Overall, glad we tried it again and it's definitely in our rotation for special occasion restaurants."}
{"text":"We had dinner here one evening. I was surprised as the restaurant is an old school residential neighborhood - lots of large trees, very shaded. Which is very cool!There was no immediately evident parking spots when I pulled up - so I took advantage of the Valet parking and let them worry about where to park the car.

I arrived a few minutes early and sat at the bar to await the arrival of the rest of our party. The bar is kind of cool - there is one section at the end that has a glass top - and inside are some gears and other mechanical stuff - kind of a steampunk look almost. Turns out the building used to be a bank!

Our server was very friendly and efficient. I ordered an IPA - can't remember the name but it was a local IPA - crisp with tones of citrus and pine, with a nice bitterness and very hoppy! Delicious!

For dinner I had the \"Salad of 7 Vegetables\" and their Mushroom Bouillon with ginger, scallions, shrimp wontons.

The salad was fresh and full of crisp vegetables with a balsamic vinaigrette of sorts,

They bring out the bowl with the contents placed in the bowl, and then pour the mushroom broth fresh and hot out of a little serving kettle or pitcher over the ingredients. The broth was rich and flavorful, with a wonderful earthiness to it. I could drink a gallon of that mushroom broth!

I can see coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Been there over a dozen times and still haven't found a bad thing on the menu.

Definitely give it a shot next time youre in the tremont area and Try the polenta as an appetizer

I'm not one to give away 5 stars to places but this place deserves it"}
{"text":"Overall: An excellent restaurant in a great neighborhood.  

Food: 4 stars.  Food is very good to excellent.  The number of food choices is limited, but there are many different types of meat and fish dishes.   

Service: 5 stars.  The waiter was extremely attentive.  I went there for my mother's birthday, and the chef came out to say hello. 

Prices: 4 stars.  Not bad.  Entrees are $25-$35.  Appetizers are relatively expensive around $10-$12.

Atmosphere: 5 stars.  The decor is amazing since it was an old bank; especially the vault.

Parking: Valet is the best option, but you can find street parking if you're willing to walk a few blocks."}
{"text":"EAT THIS, LOTS OF IT:
Hawaiian Tuna Tartare.  You've never had tuna tartare before, you say.  I don't like raw tuna, you say.  Well, let me tell you something: I lost my tuna tartare virginity to Dante and daaaaaamn girl, it was SINFUL good.  Perfectly seasoned minced tuna garnished with a heavenly poached egg, crispy potato strips and drizzled with kalamata olive remoulade?  Um, symphony of flavors and textures getting crunk in your mouth?  Take a bow, Dante.  Take a bow.

EAT THIS TOO:
The homemade array of ice creams and sorbets.  Deceptively tiny, incredibly delicious and immensely satisfying!  And in general, for romantic nights out, the 5-course standard tasting menu is a good deal and a culinary home-run.

AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE:
Late Night Noodle Menu/Happy Hour.  Just...don't.  Soup base was a lukewarm, over-salted mess.  Asked for pork broth, found beef, was told all broths are really the same.  Miso was actually cooked to graininess for the miso ramen.  Literally had to dilute my overcooked miso ramen with all my drinking water to make it palatable.  Pass, pass, and pass.
  
THIS IRKS ME:
The exclusive vault seating is super hard to book!  Sometimes on weekend evenings, the waitstaff can be overwhelmingly numerous and hovering.  Some of the tables are situated in high-traffic, awkward corners so everyone and their mama walks through your personal space.  Mood lighting in the evenings is romantic but a little extreme--when you have to pull out your flashlight app to read your menu or see what you're eating at the dinner table, maybe it's time to throw in a few more candles.

BUT...I'M STILL IN LOVE:
Renovated former bank interior oozes modern sophistication, elegance and intimacy.  All the dishes are lovely in plating and like Lola, imaginative in fusing flavors--predominantly Italian/Mediterranean and Asian.  They take their meat seriously--all meats in the charcuterie appetizer are cured in-house!--but they're also vegan and vegetarian-friendly.  Small but respectable beer list, extensive wine list.  Staff are friendly and accommodating and the bar offers killer cocktails.

RSVP NOW:
Yourself, for some romantic me-time.  Your squeeze, for some romantic squeeze-time.  Best friends, for a easy and luxurious treat.  Business associates, for instant kudos.  Any strangers you want to impress, because if it's swanky impressions you're seeking, Dante delivers."}
{"text":"I have to respectfully disagree with E.P. \"the vegetarian from Cleveland,\" who said that vegans and vegetarians will love Dante. I'm a vegetarian and I thought it was just ok. 

The highlight of my meal was the amazing fresh bread and hummus...and the Moscow mules. My vegan 7 vegetable salad was very bland. I like all of the vegetables that were included in the salad (Brussels sprouts, radishes, etc.) but the vegetables were fresh but not flavorful. The hearts of palm vegan entree was also under-seasoned and not very appetizing, although \"neat\" looking on the plate. 

Service was almost too good. I appreciated that multiple waiters kept checking on us, but I was borderline offended when my waiter insisted on resetting the table before my entree arrived so my knife could be at the appropriate angle. Dining at Dante is definitely \"an experience\" as others have stated, and if you're in a hurry, this isn't the restaurant for you. 

In Dante's defense, they had just switched over to their spring menu on the night that I dined there. Perhaps a little tweaking is needed for the vegan items? Since so many other people have raved about it (including my meat eating boyfriend who almost licked his plate after having a steak), I think I'd give it another try. Maybe just at happy hour when I can get some small plates and drinks, though."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews, I figured we had to give this place a try.

Our evening began on a Wednesday evening so we did not get to experience all the loud conversations in a dining hall atmosphere that so many have spoken about. But we did get to experience the other diners setting their cell phones on there table and listening to all the obnoxious ringtones throughout our dining experience and people getting up from the table to answer their calls while pacing in the aisles or going back to the restrooms. I understand people need to feel important, but have some class, dinner is not the time for phone calls. 

We were seated slightly before 6:00 at the table just outside of the vault, which was a creative setting.  Being one of the first diners the hostess seated us in their signature spot as we were told. Needless to say as the other diners came in they proceeded to seat the other guests at all the tables around us, with 20 or so other tables in the restaurant, I'm sure there should have been other options as to not crowd us when we first arrived.

We had the opportunity to meet and greet with Chef Dante as he made his early rounds to tell us about his specials and new additions and strike up a small conversation. I liked this opportunity as it gave us a sense of his passion for his art and food.

We found that the food was good, well prepared and presented, but a little on the salty side. We made a tour around the menu and were happy with everything we ordered as there was much variety and the dishes were creative. 

Our server was very nice, and fairly attentive. Although more attention was placed on larger groups at other tables as we had to ask for water refills more often than I thought we should as well as drink replacements.

I wanted to love Dante, I really did, but I would probably only come back for drinks and desserts maybe a couple of starters and sit bar side."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite spots. I went on a Saturday night with a group of 6 at 6:30. The entire place was full, and we could see people getting turned away at the door; definitely make reservations! 

The food was fantastic. Being a vegetarian, I couldn't sample most of the appetizers and entrees that was eaten...but the food I was able to eat was fantastic. The complimentary bread from Stone Oven paired great with their hummus. The mozzarella bocconcini was so flavorful; the leeks were very tender and the hazelnut vinaigrette tied everything together. I had the \"Spaghetti Spaghetti\" entree, which was very good. You can definitely tell that they make their own pasta, which adds to the flavor profile. I didn't really get a lot of the squash flavor, so I was kind of disappointed, but the chestnuts added great texture to the dish. Overall, it was good, but I wouldn't order it again. 

The star was the pureed Banana Butternut Squash soup...yum. I am definitely ordering a bowl when I go back. I was afraid the banana would be overpowering, but it was very balanced. The pumpkin seed brittle added a little bit of a sweet crunch, which was absolutely divine. The cinnamon foam adds a fun touch, and makes the soup a little more unique. 

The dessert was good, but nothing spectacular.  I shared the Toasted Coconut Cr√®me Caramel with dulce de leche foam and a shortbread cookie crust. The caramel creme was very smooth, and almost tasted like a flan.  I love coconut, so you can't go wrong there. Would I order it again? No. I definitely want to try the PB&J cheesecake though!

As far as service, it was the only reason I knocked this review down to 4stars. Our server definitely made it a point that Saturday was one of their busier nights, and that our food may come out slower if some people chose to do the 5 course tasting. She was informative, but a little pushy. We definitely felt like our meal was rushed...especially when she came back to our table (after we paid) and started to buss it. We didn't hang around unusually long, but felt the need to leave since we did get her not-so-subtle hints. Definitely a negative in my book."}
{"text":"I recently discovered that Dante has a LATE NIGHT NOODLES menu - they serve their version of Japanese Ramen noodles after 9:30 pm on weekdays and 10 pm on weekends.  So of course, I was very excited to check this out....

Late night noodles - 2.5 stars.
Unfortunately, the noodles were a flop.  Got to try miso and pork broths with ramen and somen noodles.  They were not the slightest bit authentic.  The ramen was similar to the instant ramen that you can get in packages at the grocery store, and not your traditional Japanese ramen.  The somen was a little better.  The miso tasted like the miso soup you would get as appetizers in a Japanese restaurant; not the miso broth that you would have with your ramen in a traditional ramen place.  The pork broth tasted like beef, and it was definitely not your typical tonkotsu broth, but it was fine.  The pork belly chunks in the soup were pretty good and tender so the soup was fine overall, but not worth staying up late for.

The rest of Dante - still 5 stars.
The linguini carbonara is still the best pasta I've ever eaten.  Get the tasting portion so you have a greater ratio of egg to pasta.  Break open that egg and let it permeate through the pasta noodles.  Yum :)

Average: About 4."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this review is not about the food, as we never even got that far. We had a reservation at 8:30. When we arrived, we were told our table was being cleaned. That's fine, we were waiting for two more people so we got a drink at the bar. They arrive about ten minutes later, we were again told that our table was still being cleared. About 15 minutes go by and we are still waiting, and who I'm assuming was the manager comes up and tells us our table will be ready shortly, that its still being cleared. Meanwhile the hostess is avoiding us, 3 other parties arrive and are sat immediately, and were told again that our table was being cleared. After finishing our drinks, we left and went to Lolita and were sat almost immediately with no reservation. At 9:30. An hour after we were supposed to be sat. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal, one that was at least approaching some of the best I've had in London, Chicago, SF, LA, and Tokyo. Not bad for Cleveland! Mind you, we went for the five-course tasting menu with wine pairings -- perhaps the most expensive thing on the menu, all told -- but we were out looking for a great time and I find that it's best to just let the chef take care of you.

First course: Charcuterie plate. Really nice mix of unusual sausages and other meats, garnished with a nice mustard and an unbelievably delicious chicken liver p√¢t√© mousse.
Second course: Tuna tartare, topped with with a poached egg and potato nest. Fantastic.
Third course: Pappardelle bolognese. Tasty, and the pasta was perfectly al dente, but this was the only dish that was merely good and not amazing.
Fourth course: Skirt steak with some sort of amazing brown sauce. I honestly don't remember what was in it because I was too busy chowing down. Yes, please do take that as a recommendation!
Fifth course: Choice of dessert. We both went for the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, served with a tart fruit sauce. Surprisingly big portion, and extra tasty.

The wine pairings were uniformly terrific. Sweet with sharp, spicy with hearty, etc. Whoever made the selections knows exactly what they're doing.

We made our reservation on very short notice -- I think I called at 2pm to get a 6pm seating on a Friday night. They were quite full that night, but still managed to find a slot that worked for us. 

Street parking in Tremont isn't that hard, but why bother when valet parking is available for just $5?

The atmosphere is pretty nifty, since the restaurant is in a converted bank and the vault is still there inside. Unfortunately, it's not visible from everywhere and so not every location in the restaurant will really capture that ambiance. And in fact ours didn't. I won't count it against the place, as it wasn't actually a negative -- we just missed out on one of the positives. (It's certainly not the worst seat I've ever had: that would be the time at Chrissie Hynde's Vegiterranean where we were seated against an enormous concrete column.) 

All in all, a big thumbs up. Easily one of the best meals I've had in Cleveland and a great night out. I hope they keep fine-tuning it and making it even better than it is today. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"First-time, out-of-town visitors we were, and the Tremont neighborhood gets one away from the too-touristy downtown area. Our Uber dropped us in front of Dante, we took a quick peek at the reviews, and took a chance on it.
Cool interior, nice combo of the old and the new in a former bank. Nice.
The clientele was older than the millennial crowds we had seen and experienced in Cleveland's downtown restaurant district, fine with us. 
Dinners were pretty darned good, except for a chicken breast dish that had issues with the sliced pea pods (stringy). Service was perfectly fine, but it should be when you are paying this much for dinner.  It was $200.00 with a bottle of wine and four entrees.
One big issue that will keep us from returning? The loud music that started up halfway through our meals. It was far too intrusive, unnecessary, and irritating. This is a fine dining establishment with pricing to match an upscale crowd. We want to have easy conversations without straining to hear, or shouting across the table at each other. The downtown brewpubs have plenty of overly loud environments, and it is a significant faux pas for to experience it here at Dante. We would have considered dessert and coffee to linger, but the music drove us out."}
{"text":"I have been to Dante twice and was very impressed on both occasions. Our group enjoyed everything we ordered. Great atmosphere but service tends to be just a little slow. 

Absolutely must try the bolognese and the porterhouse for two."}
{"text":"For adventurous food lovers, you MUST try and reserve the chef's table! It's an exclusive table located in the kitchen where you're able to watch the chef's and Dante himself prepare everything. Have the 5-course, chef designed menu with wine pairings!"}
{"text":"Went here for a nice weekend in Cleveland with my husband. I ended up having the tasting menu and it was De.lic.ious! Great experience. Would go back in a second."}
{"text":"We had the 7 steps tasting menu! Was an excellent experience. They serve salmon, shrimp, mussels (pasta!!! the best), scallop, duck, and beef. The dessert was a sharing for the table, with lemon merengue, chocolate mousse, avocado/strawberry ice cream, and banana ice cream.  The only reason it's a 4 star, it's because of the timing of serving the courses.In the first 3 courses we had to wait almost 15-20 minutes...maybe because the restaurant was crowded, but not full. 
We are heading to go back to try the normal menu."}
{"text":"Delivering gourmet American  fare and an exciting modernist space providing all the dining options the modern consumer might want--including an honest-to-golly bank vault (!) seating area for those brave souls wishing to confront their claustrophobia head-on--Dante, despite two minor setbacks outlined below, is a real stand-out from the crowded CLE foodie scene.  
The staff are pleasant, plucky, and not at all pretentious. Hosts greet from behind a podium wedged full of more post- dinner candy treats than that creepalicious candy man ever offered to the scallywag kids in the Wonka-verse's original outing.  While this may be a bit disconcerting (\"Did we wander into a sweets shop by mistake?\" asked one befuddled diner), the candy array exists as a primary means of showing one how much Dante et al. care. These are fine hard working folk who ensure that fresh baked bread flows freely (with humus, gratis!) and drink orders are promptly and efficiency placed. 
Your reviewer was whisked through the kitchen to a table in back in an exciting, voyeuristic frenzy wherein glimpses of the behind-the-scenes magic were possible, even encouraged. While everyone seemed to be working at full tilt to hand-craft the delicious dishes we later enjoyed, it was obvious that no one was taking much time to salt. But more on that in a second...
Let's first say that Dante is apparently a steak and potatoes man run through with a modern gustatory purveyor's predilections for the strange and nouveau. Enjoy some squid ink with your pasta. Or perhaps instead of fois gras by the tin as in days of yore, you'd like it as an entire, mammoth Lobe (with an equally mammoth price tag). The menu here is small, primarily meat based, and unapologetically a la carte. There are some vegetarian options such as a rather delectable polenta, but mostly this is a place for carnivores. 
The wine list is staggeringly long (a good 10 pages or more), with the top entries fetching $2,000-$3,500 a bottle. The cocktail list seemingly changes often, and there were fun twists on old school favorites like a revamped Mule and some iced sweet brandy treat named after John Steinbeck. Those looking for beer shouldn't waste their time, as there are only about ten options (most of them paltry domestics). 
But let's get back to our salt trouble, shall we? The corn and shrimp bisque was probably the blandest soup on record for your reviewer, to the point where a salt shaker had to be procured (and kept at the table like a granulated life raft) lest taste buds atrophy from underuse. As far as chief complaints go, this is the only serious one. Elsewhere, the house salad dressing left a legion of red welts in its vinegary wake, cut with not enough oil by a long shot. Your tongue might plead for mercy after a half dozen overly sour bites. These are nitpicky quibbles to be sure, but should be mentioned in an effort to be comprehensive.
Overall, Dante is a winner. A wonderful, if pricey affair ($200 for four) with a meaty American focus."}
{"text":"Ya know, I enjoyed the food and so did DH, but both of our instinct was to give 3-stars.  Our server really turned us off- we sat for ever and ever once he established that we didn't want alcohol.  Watching him stroll around and chat with people while we waited hungrily for, no kidding, 20 minutes to ask about the fairly complex menu was ridiculously frustrating.  There is a tasting menu mentioned at the top of the printed menu which he didn't bother with til we asked.  I really believe that at a restaurant with a menu like theirs it is a MUST to ask guests promptly if it's their first time and then orient them.  We were so afraid he'd disappear again that we basically ordered whatever we could think of and hoped we had a reasonable combination of sizes and courses.  I don't know how to explain it, but some dishes have one size, some two, and some a third which turns out to be for the tasting menu but a tasting portion is also available a la carte... or something.  It was all over the place.  Fun, and I think it would be great with a large group, but it needs to be a little tighter in terms of organization, clarity, and coursing.  

Both of our soups were just ok, the chicken veloute was fine and the beef with barley wasn't too exciting.  I wouldn't order either again.  I loved my carbonara way too much, it was fantastic and I nearly exploded.  DH had rabbit which we enjoyed, nothing out of this world flavor wise but cooked perfectly.  Desert was the chocolate bar, which was refreshing with a blood orange sorbet and very good overall.  Throughout the meal though our waiter was forgetting what we ordered, disappearing, and just really a mess.  At one point we both started laughing because... is that dude HIGH?  We also sat near the bar and had smoky, tipsy people leaning all over the wall between the bar and our table.  Nothing says romance like a stranger's errant elbow between you and your love.  If you're going with a significant other, definitely ask for a table in the back or middle!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant service was good. The food was not good. Very bland food for all the thought that has been put into the menu. Example the soup with tortellini in a beef broth sounded great. When the dish was served it was flavorless and the broth tasted like water and the tortellini was not cooked properly. The next dish that was received as the sea bass. The bass was overcooked bland and was oily. The potato side dish was suppose to have saffron broth in it. There was no taste of saffron and the potato tasted like boiled potatoes. In theory the menu sounds great but the execution is lacking"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations, and Dante has met all of them.

As expected of a pricey restaurant, service was amazing and quick. With that out of the way, here are the comments on the food.

You can opt to order individual dishes on the menu, or go for a 5-course or 7-course meal. Many of the √† la carte options seemed to have Asian influences. We chose the 5-course, which featured off-menu dishes, so cannot comment. I expect these dishes to change (or at least rotate) over time:

1. For starters, there was a tuna tartare over cucumbers, lightly flavored with soy sauce and sesame oil. It had an amazing texture, although the fish could be ever-so-slightly fresher.

2. To follow, there was a lemon/squid spaghetti. In my opinion, this is where the meal started getting interesting. Every bite was a slightly different flavor. Artichokes would make one bite more acidic; it would be followed by a bite where the squid would provide a stronger grilled flavor. I was very impressed.

3. Third was the grilled scallop. This was perhaps the least memorable dish of the bunch, but still tasted great!

4. If my memory serves me correctly, this was small cuts of either a New York strip or ribeye. Regardless, the meat was cooked perfectly, with three sauces to complement. Again, this combination (along with the fingerling potatoes and peas) made every bite slightly different in flavor, which made the dish an absolute delight.

5. Two desserts were available: a chocolate cake and a cherry shortcake. Both were excellent and gave a satisfying end to the meal. My only critique would be that the dessert portions were HUGE. I would've preferred to have smaller dessert portions and a slightly larger main course.

Overall, if you're looking for super-fine-dining in Cleveland, Dante is it. Your wallet won't be happy, but if you're treating someone out or celebrating an occasion, the food will make a great impression and a lasting memory."}
{"text":"Just finished a nearly perfect meal at Dante. My husband and I did the tasting menu with the wine pairing on a lazy Monday night. As many of the other reviews indicate, the atmosphere and vibe of this place are really cool. We had a tremendous server who hooked us up with a few more courses and tastes than the five listed on the menu (there's an advantage to dining on a slow day). The food was rich to the point of decadence, and the wine pairings were all well suited for the course. Normally, this would all make for a five star experience. I hate to quibble or dock a star over one ingredient, but I feel I have to here. One of our courses was a tomato and warm mozzarella salad. The cheese and all the ingredients were perfect... except for the tomato. It came out chilled (!) and woefully flavorless and mealy. Given the overall excellence of what emerged from the kitchen during every other course, a cold and bland tomato was a shocking misstep. Doesn't everyone know not to chill tomatoes by now? And if it has no flavor, why are you serving it? Yeah, it's a nitpick, but it's a fundamental error that keeps me from total and emphatic confidence in the kitchen. That's a bit of a shame, because absolutely everything else (we're talking more than 10 dishes here) was balanced, remarkable, creative, and superb. This is a great restaurant with a kitchen that pumps out incredible food. It is way above serving cold styrofoam tomatoes. Everything was so good that I'm happy to go back and see if that was a one-time error."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. They have a tasting menu but on our recent visit we ordered some appetizer portions from the ala carte menu. All staff we encountered from the hostess to the bus boys to our server David were all relaxed and friendly while still being professional. The restaurant comes off as classy with just a touch of rock and roll (it is Cleveland after all). Set in an old bank building there are classic marble and wood features accented by hip blown glass chandeliers and pendant lights. This sets the tone for the evening. Expect classic dishes with a contemporary flair. The three cheese polenta was an excellent interpretation of a classic. Served on a wooden plank it was creamy, cheesey and delicious and at 6 dollars it was a total bargain. The 9 dollar appetizer portion of the Black Forbidden Rice risotto was plentiful and tasty. The real star of our meal was the Linguine alla Carbonara. Generous cubes of house cured pancetta dotted the fresh hand made linguine which was covered in a luxurious cream sauce that was both velvety and light and topped with a poached egg. It was decadent and satisfying. At the suggestion of our server we finished our meal with a late summer addition to the dessert menu, the Strawberry Trifle. Great suggestion David. Even after so much starch (pasta, polenta AND risotto) the trifle was bright and refreshing and somehow made us feel less full. After dinner Chef Boccuzzi came to our table and did more than just the usual glad-handing. He was genuinely interested in our experience and we were very pleased to be invited to tour the kitchen and back rooms. Based on our evening, I can only say great things abour our dinner at Dante. I hope you go and have an equally special evening."}
{"text":"manager called me to apologize......very nice guy, very polite. he made me an offer to return for a dinner and drinks on the house....i declined. i'm NOT looking for freebies or hand-outs. if i were to try dante again, it would be unannounced. it wouldn't be for any special occassion, since they ruined our anniversary dinner plans last year............don't know if i'd give them a second chance, too many great restaurants in cleveland to pick from that actually want my money and get it because of good food AND SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Dantes was a pleasant surprise in an otherwise depressed area in Cleveland. Startes with olive bread with humus than a charcuterie plate with some interesting meats including a duck prosciutto. Than the papardelle bolognese and finishing with seared scallops.  Thought they where a bit salty with the cherizo and caviar.

The service was attentive and the place was trendy and inviting.  A good but somewhat pricey meal. Would return.

The 3 stars are because of the price otherwise would have been 4."}
{"text":"I could probably write a very wordy review on Dante. My family and I had a long and delicious dinner here...and tried umpteen items. But, to spare you the arduous task of reading a long review, I'll keep it to the point. 

Ambiance: Really gorgeous, transformed old bank. Beautiful lighting, dark tones and there's CANDY at the host stand. Woot-de-woot! I may have pocketed more than a few Tootsie rolls. 

Dishes to try: 
Pappardelle Bolognese: FTW. Get it, eat it, love it. Carnivores and carb fanatics unite!

Lobster spring rolls: I believe this order only comes with two rolls, but they are super fresh and stuffed with flavorful hunks of said crustacean, asparagus, mushroom and topped with a ginger sauce. 

Goat cheese fritters: Crispy little nuggets of fried goat cheese accompanied by a really interesting vinaigrette and baby slices of grapefruit. 

Dishes you may want to pass on:
Spinach cavatelli: While the portion was actually pretty generous for an appetizer size, the nicely made cavatelli was blurred by the bland gorgonzola cream sauce. The dish needed fruit or acid or *something*. 

Baby Shrimp Polenta: I sampled a few bites of my mother's polenta. Again, quite bland. With so much pizzazz and flavor from the starters, I was let down by the mains.

Overall, though, I'm a fan of Dante. The service was spectacular, many of the dishes inventive and the ambiance is beautiful."}
{"text":"I've been to Dante twice now, and both times did the tasting menu with a wine pairing. It's worth every penny. The service is top notch, and both times I've had some \"Holy ----\" moments when eating. The house-made spaghetti with a pork sausage ragu I had last night was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"For Dante, all I can speak to are the late-night ramen noodles, served only after 10pm I think. This was a while ago so bear with me, but what I distinctly remember is 
A) how completely delicious the ramen was, B) how entirely filling the ramen was, and C) how cool, sexy, and popular the atmosphere of Dante is late on a weeknight. Go figure, right? The noodles were also probably the only thing I'd be able to afford here anyway, so I can't complain! I'll probably be back for noodles."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a weekend away from the little ones and chose to start the weekend with a Friday night dinner at Dante.  We had made a 7pm reservation for 2 and were promptly seated.  We both ordered the 5-course Chef Experience and included the wine pairing.  The food was outstanding, with perhaps one issue, which may have been the result of my own misunderstanding.  I knew that salad and dessert would bookend our meal, but I went in expecting a seafood, pasta, and meat dish during our dinner.  The 2nd course featured a perfectly cooked scallop and lobster spring roll, so I was expecting a pasta dish as our 3rd course, which turned out to be seared salmon.  It was excellent, just a little disappointing that we didn't get to try any pasta.  The service was excellent - our glasses were always full and the paired wines were explained very well.  Dessert was outstanding and an excellent final note.  I'm a fan of this place having good experiences twice, and I'm looking forward to another opportunity to take the wife or a visiting client."}
{"text":"This place had a cozy, fun and upscale atmosphere. I dont know how but that definitely describes it. All of the servers were so nice. We had random servers stop by our table to chat. I've never experienced that a restaurant before! After our meal a worker outside asked us how everything was and gave us a bunch of tips about the tremont area. She talked about how much she loved working there and told us a lot about the food.  In fact all the workers seemed happy and that means their boss is great and that makes me happy as a customer. 

Calamari appetizer: fresh, good but too salty for me
Foccacia bread and hummus: delicious!
Cheese polenta: delicious
Pasta cabenera (sp?): good but too salty for me. 
Desserts: hello...amazing. I am a dessert expert and this is one of my new top dessert places in CLE. (my favorite was the chocolate crem brulee)

I thought all the food was fresh and expertly prepared but i didn't love how salty some things were.  However i definitely want to come back and try other things. There is a cool table in the vault and it would be fun to eat there on a special occasion!"}
{"text":"This was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had. I got the beef short rib and my date got the pork. Absolutely stellar"}
{"text":"Went out for a friend's going away party. Four of us each went with the Chef's 5 course Experience. The service was great and the food was excellent. The 5 courses were fairly varied, the seafood and steak wonderful, and for me the highlight was a slightly spicy lobster pasta. On the pricy side, but well worth it for a special occasion.

Really nice interior, and a good sized porch if the weather is agreeable."}
{"text":"This is another classic special occasion restaurant in Cleveland.

We had reservations for 6 people at 8 pm and were a little turned off when we were sat at 8:45. They brought us over a small meat and cheese plate for our long wait, so that was a nice touch. This restaurant looks small when you first walk in but it is really quite large, the atmosphere is upscale and modern.

The ordering here was a little confusing, they don't have appetizers laid out normally. I would suggested ordering an entree and then a tasting of either the pasta or soup as an appetizer.

My boyfriend and I split the carbonara appetizer portion because I read great reviews about it. Well let me tell you, it was awesome, but not as good as the bolognese that somebody else ordered and I snuck a bite. Immediate orders regret!

For an entree I ordered the scallops and they came with three large scallops, a piece of pork belly and rice. The flavors worked really well together! I also tried the duck, and it blew me away. For dessert we ended with the raspberry parfiat and coffee.

So the meal was really tasty and the company was great, so why only three stars? Well if someone asked me if I would go back, I would probably say no. For the price of the meal, I would much rather go to Lola or L'Albatros, which in my mind still remain the top special occasion restuarants in cleveland."}
{"text":"Not good.  Not sure if I should even give it 2 stars, but the polenta and risotto appetizers were pretty good, and the brownie dessert was very good.  

The entrees?  0 for 4, with four strikeouts... the golden sombrero.  Myself and another in our party both had the short rib, and it was meh.  The texture/ consistency of the short rib was on point, but it was lacking taste, and quite frankly, it didn't sit well (not feeling well today).  Another in our party had the scallops and they were awful.  Truly awful.  I took one bite, and couldn't finish the rest of one scallop.  Literally could not finish.  My wife had the duck and it was tasteless and felt like it may have even been sitting around for awhile before being served.  She didn't even get halfway through the duck before giving up.

Contrary to the first review, Michael Symon can rest easy if this is his competition.

One saving grace:  the service was actually excellent."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Ordered several apps. The tuna tartar is unbelievable. Carbonara is one of the best I have had. The desserts rock. Great atmosphere, great restaurant. Dante by far is the best restaurant down in Tremont, beating out Lolita. Fact!"}
{"text":"This place is as close to culinary heaven as you will get in the Cleveland area. I went here for Mother's day when I was visiting and had their buffet, and all of the food was wonderful; everything from the cavatelli's to the braised lamb was amazing. But the best part of this lunch was the desert; they had all of their deserts in small portions and everything from red velvet cake to the chocolate was super tasty. I would recommend Dante to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Went for an anniversary and it was the first time I've ever been.  I found this place on the PD's \"A list\" of restaurants.  The service was impeccable, they filled our wine the whole night for us, the server described all of our food when it came out and it was perfect timing.  The atmosphere is great.  More importantly, the food was INCREDIBLE.  We bought the duck dish, which I would highly recommend and a pesto pasta dish.  They were both the right size and delicious with every bite.   In addition, the prices were fair.  We're east siders, so we have not been to Tremont much, but this place was worth it.   We frequent Bistro 185, but will travel for this place more often.  The ice cream and espresso dessert was also great!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend and I wanted to try at least one of the fancy restaurants in Cleveland, but I could not for the life of me decided on a place until the very last minute.

How did I decide on Dante? The name! I couldn't resist the name. And, as it turns out, I couldn't resist the food, either.

On top of the delicious free bread with dipping oils and hummus, I ordered the pappardelle bolognese. I had the server put extra, extra parm on it because I'm a monster, and it was outstanding. Just outstanding. Incredibly filling and I don't recall being able to eat all of it, but so very good. The pasta was clearly hand-made, as the menu indicated, and the sauce was perfectly balanced with the meats.

For dessert we got the tasting of home-made ice cream and sorbets, and the one I remember the most was the \"cereal milk\" ice cream. You know how, as a kid (and maybe as an adult), the best part of your morning cereal was the milky, sugary sludge that was left at the bottom of the bowl of your Cinnamon Toast Crunch? Imagine that in ice cream form. So. Good.

The patio area is very nice, very spacious. I guess this place used to be a bank (vault)? So the space is really interesting. The service is outstanding. Our server was there and knew what was up. I kind of didn't want to leave, but it was getting late and I had a plane to catch the next day. Definitely want to go here again on my next visit, though!"}
{"text":"This place is fancy and affordable.  Yes! I used those words together! :)  The atmosphere is a little busy but this time we went a little later on week night and it was steady but not overly crowded.  They also have a chef's table and a back dining room which is in a bank vault. Oh yea, how could I forget to mention, this was an old bank building :)  It is absolutely awesome italian food with a lot of new fusion foods.  Dante's has tasting portions which are big enough for me, unless you are someone that has a huge appetite then you can get an appetizer or entree portion.  It is nestled in the heart of tremont next to the chef owner's other restaurant called Ginko.  You can dress in cute jeans and a fun top and be fine.  Or you can stroll in with a dress and some cute heels... This restaurant is definitely a place I will recommend to friends and family.  I will definately return."}
{"text":"Bad experience for out of town guests.  We went to Dante because we love Ginko, but my wife being pregnant sushi was out of the question.  The food  here was ok, but it was overpriced and the service was terrible.  At half the price this would have earned 3 stars, with good service depending on the entree between a 3 and a 5.

We arrived for our 8:00 reservation and had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated.  From there, we ordered appetizers.  The spicy calamari and shrimp appetizer was excellent as was the bread.  My wife ordered the chilled popcorn soup which was ok.  Nothing special, it tasted like you might imagine cold cream of corn soup with popcorn sprinkled on top would taste. Meh.

The mains were pretty good.  Of the 4 mains we ordered the ribeye was by far the best.  The scallops were average to good.  The pappardelle pasta was like eating a deconstructed lasagna (the noodles were just way too doughy and wide at an inch and a half or more).  The duck was pretty good, not great.  

The timing of the service was off and the waiter was inattentive and rude.  This was the main problem with our meal.  It was about an hour from the time we were seated until the time we got our mains and it was probably another 20 minutes from the time we were clearly finished with our food until the time our waiter finally brought out our bill.  Apparently he had asked someone else to do it.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"4 friends out to celebrate a birthday at Dante's last night.  The place was packed, and we were seated promptly  Our server, Candace, was outsanding.  She was the icing on the cake to a very festive evening!

We started off with an exceptional drink with vodka, cranberry and cinammon spices.  I can't remember the name of the drink, but it's on their list of specialty drinks, and worth a taste.

Apps:  Calamari- delicious and Foie Gras- delicious

All the food served to us was presented beautifully.

We ordered a side of 3 cheese polenta, which was highly recommended on Yelp, but it was really pasty.. consistency of oatmeal.

Duck cassoulet, surf and turf, pork tenderloin, and chicken were cooked well.  All the food served to us was presented beautifully.

Candace bought us a complimentary birthday dessert to share.  Beautiful, delicious layers of nuts, whipped cream, brownie pieces, and other yummy bits of goodness.  

Plan on spending around $75/person.

The staff, atmosphere, and food will bring me back!"}
{"text":"So before we start, I just want to say this would have EASILY been a five star evening had it not been for the service.  And the service would have easily been five stars had it not been for the way our server responded to our request.  

So, here is what killed the service and a star.  We ordered the five course tasting menu paired with wine ($95 per person).  Three courses in, we were filling up and were slowing down a bit.  We asked the server to hold off a bit on serving the next course so we could enjoy the rest of the wine from the current course and let everything settle a bit.  We were told, \"No we are busy and need the table\" and she walked away.  I really thought she was kidding when she said that, but the next course showed up almost immediately!

Ok, yes, it was a busy Saturday evening.  But when you have two folks wanting to enjoy the hard work put into the food by the chefs on $95 tasting meals and you get railroaded though on timing, I'm sorry, but that's bad service in my book.  You need to allot more service time for that meal than a standard appetizer and entree service.  We didn't have a time to finish the previous or next course, so that went back to the kitchen unfinished.  And we also didn't have a chance to finish the wine (unless we slugged it down for the next two courses) so we left with two half glasses of red wine (each) on the table.   

With that being said, if you came here on a busy weekend night and ordered appetizers and an entree, I'm sure you'd be fine.  I'd just strongly recommend you don't go for the five course tasting menu on a busy night.

Dante - If you can't give folks time to enjoy the five course tasting menu  due to needing tables, I'd suggest you take this off the menu on busy nights.  It would work out better for both sides.

The food here was amazing - five stars.  I'm not going to put the time into reviewing it as they didn't put the time into letting us enjoy it.  All l'm going to say is everything was excellent and the two deserts we had (Affogato al Caff√© and Jar of Creme Brulee) were amazing! 

No question I'll come back here on future dates.  I'm just never try the tasting menu unless I'm there on a slow weekday.

Food   :            A+
Service :          C -
Atmosphere : A-  (A bit noisy)
Price   :            B-  (Would have been an A, but can't give an A on price when one can't enjoy their meal or wine)"}

One of Cleveland's gastronomic old-guard, a modern-Italian and Mediterranean eatery housed in a former Bank in Tremont, Dante had long been a place worthy of consideration for a special event in Northeast Ohio, the recent launch of a 21-course tasting raising eyebrows though the daily a la carte menu had long offered plenty of room for variety with value.

Owned by Chef Dante Boccuzzi, his collection of restaurants now bolstered by the casual Dante Next Door and a Cleveland-based Pizzeria in addition to spaces in cities further East, entry to Dante sees diners met by a hostess podium lined with candy beneath low lighting, the ceilings reaching skyward as Motown plays lowly and vibrant paintings decorate the walls.

Seated and greeted by a young female server, the restaurant menu accurate to that online with the addition of a few daily specials, it was only after substantial discussion of plates and portion sizes that decisions were collected, a dozen plates served in five courses beginning with three housemade Breads and piquant orange Hummus.

Making everything from Bread, Pasta and Desserts to Charcuterie in house, those favoring a good board would be foolhardy to pass on Boccuzzi's $18 platter serving no less than eleven Meat selections in addition to Pickles, Jams and Crackers, both Lamb selections as well as the Terrine and Confit particularly impressive, and by itself more than enough to serve as a proper meal.

Intrigued by the description of Foie Gras 'ala mode,' a seared Steak proving to be exactly that when plated next to an unsweetened apple pie topped in a slowly melting Vanilla sphere that added a mellow top note to each bite, course three  presented a trio of pasta \"tastes\" alongside a creamy mound of Cornmeal, the Linguine alla Carbonara unfortunately a touch undersalted while the Beet Fettuccine and ribbons of Pappardelle were each exemplary beneath their rich Sauces.

Attempting to show some restraint by sending back part of the Mascarpone Polenta after finishing more than half, in addition to the roasted Pumpkin and Pork Belly, course four was clearly more than was expected from $6 Risotto tasting portions, the all-red Bhutaneese, Wine, Onions and Apples a pleasant shock to the senses by way of its focus on acid while the Carnaroli and Black Forbidden Rice were both appropriately textured, though slightly overwhelmed by the addition of poignant herbal ingredients.

Happy to see a dessert tasting also offered, essentially three half-portions from the menu at a cost of $18, one would be strained to fault any aspect of the complex Pumpkin Parfait or forgivingly light Pistachio Mousse with Orange Curd and Sherbet, the Apple Torte with Butterscotch nonetheless an overwhelming favorite as fried Pecans were melded to the cake by way of Ice Cream, dehydrated Fruit Chips and sweet Cider Sauce."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere - hand blown Chihuli style glass, bank vault, gears. Food is also excellent. Not very busy on weeknights, no TV's at bar. Intimate and dimly lit setting. Also, it's a great area to walk around in Tremont. GF friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland!

I love their happy hour. They offer a sushi pop (sushi rolls in a push pop), mussels, toban yaki (meat cooked on a ceramic plate) for about $3-6. I loved the toban yaki! I've had both the pork belly and the hanger steak and they were both delicious. Nice and tender and juicy! So awesome, I'm salivating over the thought of it.

They also had a couple of cocktails, which were blah. I've tried both the passion martini and pomegranate lemonade, which were both bitter. But nothing can take away from the awesomeness of the toban yaki.

Make sure to collect the Dante guitar picks. You can trade in 10 Dante guitar picks for a $50 gift certificate. If you split the check, each bill gets a guitar pick."}
{"text":"This review only pertains to the late night ramen they serve here. 

Thrillest's top 21 ramen place HA. I could've made better ramen myself. The broth was very bland (like water) and the noodles looked and tasted like the $0.99 ramen package you get. NOT worth the $12 I paid for the full bowl."}
{"text":"Stopped here with fellow yelpers Lin and Joyce. Let's try out the happy hour, we said! And off we went to the west side.

Walking in, there was plenty of seating on a Tuesday night at 6pm. Modern interior- apparently, the restaurant used to be a bank, so there's even a vault in the back of the restaurant. Cool.

Off we went to get our dinner. We're all avid foodies, so we all ordered randomly different dishes and tried them all. For the handmade pastas, we ordered all three off the menu- the linguine alla carbonara, 
pappardelle bolognese, and ricotta cavatelli. The latter two pastas were ok- but that linguine- with the poached egg in it, was oh so good. 

And let me agree with them- the black forbidden rice risotto was pretty amazing. Holy cow, that was really good.

The rest of the menu was good-not super mind blowing amazing, but good.

We ordered off the happy hour menu:
The salmon 3 ways sushi: it was okay...
The miso mussels: Mmmm. A LOT of mussels came out for such little price..and the sauce was pretty good!
The french fries- were kinda of like frites. It was a tad spicy- didn't really taste fishy at all.... 
The tempura chicken wings- bleh. Not really that good.... I'm not sure what it was....just kind of....bleh. I guess I'm used to tempura being really crispy...and not so...soft? I'm not sure.

The drinks were way too strong that we ordered as well..... so...just get food here. haha.

Overall, the pros outweighed the cons, and still a great place to stop by when you're hungry. Great and definitely interesting food....."}
{"text":"2 times to Dante. Once back in May 2012 for dinner, and more recently for Happy Hour. 

The one thing I remember from the first time was that they had good customer service - complimentary 2 glasses of champagne for bf's birthday. Also delicious lavender creme brule served in a cute glass jar.

Happy Hour Review:
Way too salty. This is sad, as I really badly wanted to like the happy hour as it sounded so good on the menu. Ordered the mussels, toban yaki pork belly, toban yaki hanger steak, and fries. Fries were generously portioned for only $3 each. Toban yaki hanger steak (4 small bite sized pieces of steak) was really really really salty; the veggies in it were also unbearably salty. It seems that they just dump the whole soy sauce bottle in the tiny dish. Toban yaki pork belly was slightly less salty (3 small bite sized pieces of pork belly) as the meat didn't absorb as much of the soy sauce. Again, veggies were too salty to eat. The complimentary bread with hummus was yummy (3 different types of bread - multigrain, olives, plain). Ordered the $18 for 3 desserts - banana chocolate cake, creme brule with figs, and lemon berry parfait cake. Would come back for the dessert + bread. May try happy hour again, but need them to cut way back on the salt."}
{"text":"This place is so trill.  First of all, it's in a building that used to be a bank, and there's tables in the old vault.  There's a great patio for nice nights.  And the location is right in the heart of Tremont (across the street from Lolita).  

Geographical and architectural compliments aside, the food was amazing.  The highlights of our meal were the braised veal, shrimp, and desserts sampler.  There is a nice wine selection as well, and we partook in a nice bottle of red, the type and name of which currently escapes me.  

All in all, Dante made for a perfect summer night and I cannot wait to get back there."}
{"text":"This review is for their late night ramen only.

We went there for their ramen (after 10:30PM) because apparently they made it to the top 20 ramen places in the US. My friends from Seattle were so excited to be there and we ordered three different flavors - miso, pork, and shoyu ramen. I had to say we were all pretty disappointed by the ramen. The broth was very watered down and does not have the traditional japanese ramen broth's consistency and thickness. The miso ramen is the best among all and I would recommend it. The pork ramen tasted like seaweed ramen in seaweed broth, nothing close to the japanese pork broth that I was looking for. And the worst among all is the shoyu ramen. I think they literally just mixed the ramen in soy sauce and gave it to us. It was really bad, very very salty. I have heard so many good things about this place, and I have always wanted to be there. Next time, I'll come try the regular dinner menu, but no ramen again."}
{"text":"The restaurant was fairly busy on a Saturday evening, but we were still able to get a table for 4 out on their patio without reservations. 

We split several pasta dishes and appetizers to try a little bit of everything. Calamari and shrimp was excellent. The breading was light and not greasy. The sauce could have been a little more inventive, but overall it was very tasty. Also try the polenta and pork belly. Avoid the barley pasta. It tasted like eating steel-cut oats and was extremely bland. 

The prices are high for the main dishes, so I recommend smaller plates to get your money's worth. 

We were attacked by beetle bugs at the end of our meal.  They kept flying in our hair. And also, this morning, I looked in the mirror and unfortunately, their outdoor patio wrought iron chairs left huge 6 inch waffle patterned bruises on butt cheeks.  Sorry to be gross, but I typically don't bruise easily and I'm a small girl. I would recommend that they get some cushions on those seats because I won't be going back anytime this summer to sit there!"}
{"text":"We held our wedding on the patio and had our reception in the back room. Monica was supremely flexible and helpful in helping us plan the even-- offering suggestions and accommodations. She came up with ways to make our wedding really wonderful-- things I had not even thought to ask! The room and patio were lovely, the food was beyond delicious and the service was flawless and gracious. 

If you have a party for fewer than 35 people and you want to treat them to the best food and service in town, this would be the place."}
{"text":"The wife and I ducked into Dante on a Friday nite, after the Tremont Art Walk, without a reservation. The hostess was able to sneak us in ahead of another reservation...I really appreciated this. It foretold of good things, and we had excellent service all night, despite being last-minute interlopers. (We exited our table with exactly 1 minute to spare.)

A converted old-style bank with high, ornate vaulted ceilings, Dante's occupies a truly beautiful space in Tremont. The downside to all this open verticality is that's also it's pretty noisy...not so loud that you'll require semaphore flags or hand-signals or anything...but loud enough to be a distraction. 

The food was overall pretty good, if a bit-heavy handed. With several dishes, the ingredient that should have been in the spotlight ended up becoming a minor side-show. The crudo appetizer was overwhelmed by the heavy fried okra and sauce, and the octupus disappeared in the heirloom tomato salad. Both dishes were still enjoyable, but you needed to isolate the octopus and crudo to even stand a chance of tasting it at all...like LeBron calling a clear-out: \"Bosh, get the fuck out of the lane and go pour me a vodka soda.\" Also, you've got some weird portion sizes happening with a la carte side dishes. (Like, do you really need to confound me with 3 different portion sizes of polenta?) You have to piece together your own menu like a jigsaw puzzle, which is the sort of intellectual exercise that I really try avoid on Fridays after 5PM. We both spent a long time looking at the menu, wondering what the hell we were supposed to be doing. (If we had more time to eat, the chef's tasting menu might have been the way to go, just to remove yourself from all that decision-making.)

Overall, I think this might be a good drink and appetizer spot, just to hang out and enjoy this very cool old building. Maybe hang out with some happy-hour bankers who just can't get enough of this stuff...sniffing out the trace scents of old money that used to slumber in the vaults here...hell, I don't know what motivates those people. The menu is full of exciting, ambitious, seasonal ingredients, but sometimes there was just too much stuff happening on our plates to recommend Dante as prime dining destination. It was like Yngwie Malmsteen was back there in the kitchen...DUDE...EDIT!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip and dined at Dante with a group of six. Dante is in an old bank building and has some historic features around the dining area and bar. We sat in the front window where there was a little less nostalgia, but the food more than made up for it. I had crab encrusted sea scallops which were served with fingerling potatoes. The scallops were perfectly prepared and had amazing flavor. I barely had room for dessert but managed to eat the chocolate creme br√ªl√©e with sesame ice cream. While I was stuffed, I couldn't leave a bite of it on my plate."}
{"text":"Good service (well, the waitress and waiter were attentive anyway.  We waited over an hour from the time our food order was placed until it was served.  The bread served with dipping oils and hummus was solid.)

Classy looking establishment (located inside an old bank vault).  

Great cocktails.

Food=incredibly mediocre

I was with a large group of people; therefore I saw just about every dish on the menu:
-All three pastas lack flavor.   
-Their take on surf & turf was interesting, but didn't provide nearly enough quantity. 
-The filet was good, but if you want steak, you can do better.

I'd strongly recommend an appetizer of mussels and the horseradish-encrusted salmon.   Other than that, I can't endorse anything about this place.  

I might consider giving 3 stars if the prices were just a bit lower.  The poor value knocks it to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Dante may be becoming one of my favorite Tremont restaurants.  The place is really charming and has a really great ambiance.  Our service has always been really attentive, as well!

On our latest trip, I wasn't really feeling a super heavy meal - so I tired the three cheese polenta (so good!) and an appetizer portion of the spaghetti.  The spaghetti was amazing!  I know that upon reading the menu everyone is going to think it sounds very boring/bland, but Dante definitely gets it right!

I love that all of the pasta dishes come in multiple sizes (tasting, appetizer, entree) so you try more than one! 

I actually had room for dessert and ordered the most heavenly graham cracker crusted cheesecake that was inside of a dark chocolate shell with marshmallow creme and chocolate gelato on top. Yes, it really tasted as good as it sounds.  And that dessert should be enough to make everyone want to go there at least once."}
{"text":"Dante is one of my favorite places to eat. It is a great place to take a date if you are pretty sure the person is cool. The service has always been excellent and the vibe of the restaurant is great. Last time I was there, I believe the server's name was Charles. The guy was a real class act. He seemed genuine and definitely knew the menu and provided good wine recommendations. The patio in the summer is a great place to dine. There are so many options on the menu and the many small plates are priced well enough to taste a lot of flavors. The handmade pasta is good. I enjoyed the octopus more than the scallops. One of my favorite dishes is the salmon. The black quinoa and mushroom soup did not really do it for me. The salad of 7 vegetables is a little pricey for $10 but is wonderful and light. The happy hour is still one of my favorites. After reading Manoa's endorsement for the tuna tartare, I think I made a mistake by never ordering it. I guess next time I will do that. I have had some memorable experiences at Dante and am very excited for him to open the new place next door."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Cleveland! Whatever you order, you can't go wrong! 
Very nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good food, but overpriced for what it was.  The individual plates looked good, but the Chefs 5-course meal was waaaaaay overpriced at $75 a person.  The server was really odd, the expo was a mumbling mess when delivering our food, and the cappuccino (which was delicious) was $5 each.  Disappointing since I'd heard pretty good things.  Too much great food in Cleveland to waste another trip here.  Sorry"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place. The vault rooms are cool, but I'm not sure how you get one other than making a reservation well in advance. We sat near one, though, and it added to the ambiance. 

The food was mostly good, but I will say that sharing is a wise choice. We had the tuna tartar -- very good, though I'm not much of a fish fan. Then, we had the carbonara, which was very creamy, but not bacon-y enough. It also needed some salt and pepper, which were not on our table. Third, we had the three-cheese polenta, which was really bland. We told our waitress that we weren't fans, and she took it off our check. For dinner, we had the chicken dish with couscous and Swiss chard. Everything on that plate was delicious. It really blew the rest of the food out of the water. 

The wait staff was almost hovering, but I'd rather have that than be neglected. Overall, it was a good experience, but I would not have the carbonara or the polenta again. The other food (tuna and chicken) were top notch -- five star worthy -- but not the pasta and polenta."}
{"text":"The back room is so cozy! I'd recommend requesting a seat there especially in the winter as it puts you away from the doors. And the staff was so friendly and attentive. Our waiter and/or his assistants constantly refilled our water, filled our tea mugs from the French press on the table, and when our tea light candle went out he noticed just as we were commenting on it and relit it. 
When we first arrived our server was welcoming and explained the menu format to us. He informed us of the way the Chef's tasting menu worked. 
We had come here specifically for this special tasting menu so ordered it. It contains a salad type course, three entree type courses, a sorbet palate cleanser and a dessert course. The waiter makes note of any allergies, dislikes or dietary restrictions and then the chef gets to work. Our reservation was 1930 and the entire experience lasted about three hours. It didn't seem long however, we were surprised when we saw the time as we departed. 
Each course was described in detail to us as it was brought out. The 1st course was an octopus salad with radish and some greens. Secondly we had a pasta with rabbit. Thirdly we had scallops and white beans. Fourth was strip steak and mushrooms. We had sorbet and then a lot of desserts. Now it was my birthday so I'm not sure if we were given more desserts than normally comes out with the Chef's tasting menu, but I thought the desserts - all 4 of them - were quite large. 
I definitely want to come back and try another one of the tasting menus (other options include reverse, vegan or vegetarian)."}
{"text":"We had a good experience at Dante. We ordered a  seabass, a steak, and a gnocchi. We love all of our entrees. The only criticism I have regarding the seabass dish is the black rice is a little too creamy and heavy with butter and seasoning in my opinion. We ordered ahi tuna tartar and fried calamari for appetizer but we weren't crazy about them. While they were good, we had similar or better ones for half the price at other restaurants. So overall, 3 stars for service, 4 stars for appetizer, 5 stars for entree!!!"}
{"text":"They have the best happy hour!  Try their mussels and Toban Yaki pork belly!  They also have awesome tasting portions of their entrees!  I had their linguini carbonara, which was delicious!  But the best part of this whole experience was Victoria, the bartender, who holds no secrets when it comes to making spectacular cocktails!  They have their own homemade infused liquors that they use in their signature cocktails. I would highly recommend the Astoria's Book signature cocktail. On the happy hour, the watermelon bramble was also very good!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant. I ended up having an overall poor experience. Only one of the 6 dishes my table order was good (the Hawaiian Tuna Tartare), the bread didn't come to our table until after our appetizers, our appetizers and pasta dishes came out all together which was very frustrating and ended with having to eat cold pasta (the Linguine alla Carbonara tasted like plain Alfredo and the Carnaroli Rice was so overpoweringly lemon-y), everything was too salty and off balance and service was very slow. Also, the music was SOOO loud that everyone in the restaurant had to yell to hear each other. I was uncomfortable, couldn't talk to my parents and family who I flew across the country to see and none of us enjoyed our meal or experience."}
{"text":"It was nice, server was kind, but on the pushy side. The dishes were pretty looking... as we did the chef's tasting. But .. 
Wasn't impressed with the salad crab, nor with the spaghetti. Duck was great. And the beef was on the salty side. I would avoid the tasting menu in the future.. Kinda overrated..."}
{"text":"This is basically a way to impress a date. Its only good for happy hour besides that. I had the Salmon, which was very good, small portion and close to 30$. Really?! I have no complaints on the service, it better be good for these prices. Im definitely not cheap, but I know high prices for no apparent reason when I see them. Ill definitely be back, probably complaining in my updated review also, so don't not go because of this one review. Theres 100+ others to give you a better sense of what to think of this place. 

Other positives, they have a lot on the menu and ok beer selection, great wine list also. I suggest try it out for happy hour and make your decision, unless you're looking to impress a date like I said."}
{"text":"While I have never eaten at Dantes, since I'm addicted to Ginkos in the basement, I love coming up for drinks at the bar. You can wait for your table at Ginkos at Dantes bar and they come get you when seats open up. Paul one of the main bartenders there is very friendly and makes the best drinks I have ever tasted. I highly recommend drinking here, it is worth the price."}
{"text":"Loved Dante. In the heart of Tremont Dante is an old high ceiling bank building that's beautifully decorated with painted walls and tiled floor. The chandelier is unique. The entrees, apps, and drinks were top drawer. I had the duck entree, calamari, and Brussels sprouts which were all delicious. But there's so much more than the wonderful food. You can request the table in the vault if you want a little privacy. The smaller rooms in the back look out on a summer patio. The chefs table is right in the kitchen. You can watch the workings of the cooks and talk to the chef. So neat for six people, I think. Check out the old fashioned bar. My group of ten sat behind a wall. We could talk and see the activity, too.  So cool!"}
{"text":"Given the reviews I was hoping to find another CLE go-to spot but sadly this didn't do it for me. I went on a busy friday night to celebrate our anniversary. The building was cool, looking like a nightclub from the outside, with the old bank sign on the door, and with an old bank interior with sky high ceilings and cool architecture. The awesome interiors with the sky high ceilings did nothing for the noise level of the restaurant and I had problems hearing my bf the whole night. We took a look at the menu and wanted to order everything.

The service was good and we decided to forgo the tasting menu for more promising dishes. Foie gras brulee to start, sea scallops for me, and the special roasted pheasant for my bf. This is probably my personal taste, but I think I prefer my foie gras more on the savory side. The pairing with a cinnamon roll-like bread and dark chocolate mousse didn't do it for me in the long run, I think it would have been a good idea as an amuse bouche but not as a whole appetizer. My scallops were cooked well but it was drowning in sauce to the point where the sauce threatened to overtake my food. My bf's pheasant dish was similar where it had too much going on the plate to be good. 

The experience wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't what I was hoping for either. Nothing really stood out for me, the three stars are for the foie because it was probably a misorder on my part."}
{"text":"Awesome. Ambiance of this Tremont-based restaurant is great: from the wood-paneled walls, to the mod art, to the open vault door alongside a table in the main dining area.

Service is very good: excellent knowledge of the menu and recommendations, but a slight delay in water-glass refills at first (much improved when our poor waitress wasn't alone later in the meal).

And the food. You can get an awesome meal at a wonderful value, or you can splurge on entrees or even the tasting menu (given the amount of food we got- I cannot imagine doing the tasting menu unless you've fasted for days beforehand).

Dante offers all its soups, risottos, polentas, and pastas in tasting amounts, and these \"tastes\" are generous to a fault. \"Tastes\" of soup were basically small bowls. A \"taste\" of the risotto could have been an entree at a more penny-pinching place. The banana butternut squash soup was quite sweet, but the pumpkin seed brittle at least cut the intensely rich and creamy texture. The lobster and cannellini bean soup was delicious - a lighter but more extravagant version of a hearty beef stew. Finally, the shrimp dumpling consomm√© was a disappointing rendition of the Asian classic.  The BBQ eel risotto, meanwhile, was very interesting, though not necessarily more than the sum of its parts (get it if you like eel, but do not expect anything transcendental).

Finally, already beyond stuffed, we still had two entrees on the way: the Hawaiian tuna and the grilled seafood trio. The tuna was huge and excellently prepared. The veggies and miso tortellini were both fantastic additions.  The grilled seafood trio was very good, but no better than at a decent seafood restaurant.

Overall, a very good experience. The lobster spring roll and the miso tortellini were the best things we ate, and the ambiance was phenomenal. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Dante is delicious! The menu seems a little confusing at first but the waiter does a great job of explaining everything - including the specials."}
{"text":"Dante's been my best restaurant experience in Cleveland by far.  Part of why I love this place so much is that no matter how high my expectation or anticipation, Dante has never let my palate down.  Consistency is not something to be poo-pooed (I can't imagine anything worse than psyching yourself up for a great repeat dinner, only to have said culinary fantasy obliterated by inconsistent kitchen output).  Repeatability is the true mark of a great chef. 
 
This is the place to go if you gravitate towards complex yet clean tastes(a distinct departure from Michael Symon's & Zack Bruell's restaurants).  Nearly every dish has a pitch-perfect balance of flavors, along with just the right portion.  Every time I go, I leave not only satisfied, but also happy.  Really, my spirits are lifted--and that's what truly excellent food is meant to do, right? 

The Happy Hour is above average (mussels in miso broth are a very good deal--you get about 10 shellfish), but I'd recommend going there for a full meal. Try the oysters (get a full dozen!) and the polenta with spare ribs.  Also, the Aviation cocktail is a super-duper, olive-drab gem.  Delish!

My only criticism of Dante is the god-awful art on the walls. The previous faux Modiglianis have been replaced by some truly mundane photos of pasta-making.  Please Dante hire some interior designers and visual artists who are as good at their craft as you are at cooking!  I'd like some pretty to look at while noshing on your delicious food. :)"}
{"text":"When my friend called and asked for the Chef's table for our party of 7, I had no idea I would be, literally, in the kitchen.  Interesting concept, but I think it was an off-night and, in retrospect, maybe we should have gotten a table in the dining room.

Being in the kitchen somehow heightened my expectations, and I guess, I was expecting some more....I don't know?  attention, conversation, humor from the kitchen staff and Dante himself.  

We all selected the Chef's choice 5 course meal.  I was a little surprised that Dante was in the kitchen.  He explained 2 of the courses, then one of his sous chefs explained he had to attend a pressing matter, and he was not around the rest of the evening.  I enjoyed talking to staff, when they talked with us.  In the end, to me it felt like we were imposing on the kitchen staff, instead of being a welcome addition to the party.

But, here's where the true test is: the food.  And man, I enjoyed it a lot.  It's not French Laundry material, but it's real good (and not $500/person).  The courses were well plated, and the flavors were extraordinary.  The cocktails were great and inventive.  The food selections/courses were great, and ran the range from fish to beef.  Desserts were delicious.

Had we been in the dining room, perhaps I wouldn't have been let down by the expectation of sitting at the Chef's table, and the food would have spoken louder than anything.  For the price ($100/pp including drinks), it is a real deal (at least compared with what is the norm in the San Francisco area) and I would go there frequently if I lived in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Oh, Dante - you have to realize that when you use the overflow space in Next Door, that you need more staff to serve it! 

We visited Dante as a larger group of about 10 people.  Sitting over on the Next Door side, we were one of several large groups.  Our waitress was pleasant enough (although, polenta is not a rice mash dish!), but she was obviously overwhelmed.  We were often left drink-less, and we only got bread once.  I mention that because we waited for dinner for 2 hours and it wasn't till closer to 3 hours when we were out of there.  Dinner itself was delicious, but 3 hours?  Just to get our checks, we were all standing for probably 20 minutes (again, drinkless).  

On one respect, if we'd had a long dinner, that probably would have been fine if we'd at least gotten drinks regularly.  In fact, Dante could have made a little more money off of us, if that was the case.  It really isn't appropriate to be made waiting that long though and I fully see it as taking reservations for groups that they were not at all prepared for."}
{"text":"Made reservations here for my wife's birthday. 

We decided to go with the chefs tasting menu.

First let me state the the service was excellent. However the food left some to be desired.

1.) Beet Salad: 4/5 Goat cheese and beets were good, duck confit was dry.
2.) Seared Scallops: 3/5 Scallops were cooked correctly, however the broth they came in was completely flavorless
3,) Pasta w/short rib: 3.5/5 Pasta was cooked perfectly however the cream sauce was bland and there was barely and short rib.
4.) Filet: 2/5: Filet was cooked perfectly however there was a foam sauce all over it that was EXTREMELY SALTY and almost inedible. 
5.) Dessert: 3/5: Dessert was a standard chocolate pie of some sort, it was ok. Seemed like it was just defrosted and not made in house.

Overall the food was OK, however for how expensive this place is, I can think of 20 other places in Cleveland I would rather go. I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Delish.  Great salad. Fresh, tasty and healthy as well. Great server and atmosphere.  Love the neighborhood.   Decor was comfortable and trendy. I would go back."}
{"text":"Over the past few years, I've been here quite a few times. Every time the whole experience has been spot on. The food is always good, and the service is better. This last time a group of 6 sat at the Chef's table to celebrate the holidays. We started with a lobster ceviche. I think this was my overall favorite course. The dish was perfectly balanced and tasted so fresh. It had a sorbet on top so it was just such an interesting dish with the different temperatures. The second course was pasta with short ribs. This was good. Third, monkfish with roasted squash and shrimp risotto. The squash and risotto were the star of this course. The fourth course was beef with caramelized onions and also some pearl onions. I could eat an entire plate of the pearl onions that came with this dish. Dessert course I can't really describe because there were so many things to try and so many things that were good. I really enjoyed the parfait, it was pudding and grahams, I know they made it sound fancier, but in simple terms... yum. 
As always at Dante, the service was excellent and a few at the table ordered the wine pairings and I loved hearing and learning about all the different types of wine. 
As always, Dante's will continue to be a place for special occasions and is, in my opinion one of the better restaurants in Cleveland (and we have a lot, so that's saying something!)"}
{"text":"Went last night for \"Late Night Noodles\" and they exceeded my expectations.  The taste and cook was spot on.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  We sat by one of their floor to ceiling windows and the ambiance combined with the falling snow was really nice.  I've been here before and rated 5-stars."}
{"text":"Wow!! The food blew my mind, from the beautiful presentation and rich flavors! We had the charcuterie, linguine alla carbonara, and the Napoleon dessert, along with a few cocktails, all while enjoying from behind the bar at a special table known as the cockpit. What an incredible and unique experience! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Into the inferno with Dante. Hope we get through purgatory and then paradise after the 5 course meal is over. I ordered the 5 course and just told the waitress whatever they wanted to give me ill eat. First course Meat tasting app with different sausages, chicken loaf and pickled veggies. Starting off good, very tasty and unique. I don't usually get to try these exotic meats so far I'm excited. Next course Tuna tartar with egg yolk and capers and cream, starting to rise out of the inferno and into the shadows of purgatory. Next course, Pasta bolognese: authentic, fresh, and ate every bit of the small tasting portion. 
Main course, Pork tenderloin, done rare and very flavorful in its presentation. i can start to see archangels and clouds. Dessert: coconut creme and ice cream.  I can see St. Peter in the distance at what looks like pearly gates. This restaurant gets my Tremont stamp of approval. One note about our waitress: not overly friendly but the food and casual atmosphere made up for it. You need to try this place and maybe you'll reach paradise like I did."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot.

I have been coming to Cleveland for business for the past 3 years and I have rarely ventured outside of the downtown area because I did not have a car.  But this night, wanting to impress my client, I decided to get a ride to the Tremont area.  It was perfect as we walked into an old bank building, still with the vault!  (Side Note:  I'm in commercial real estate and my client is in the banking industry.  We both know it is impossible to get rid of old bank vaults and their 2 ton doors!).  Using it to age your meats was a great example of \"highest and best use\"...

Being Italian from Chicago, I admittedly have high standards for Italian food and Dante exceeded my expectations.  They did something that I have never seen before and I wish more places did it.  The menu offered three different sizes of pasta which is perfect for me as I like to taste the various fares, but don't want to fill up on a heaping plate of pasta.  Great idea!

I always enjoy an interesting craft cocktail menu and they had one drink (can't remember what is was called) that was a play on a Manhattan.  Very tasty!

Overall, food was excellent as was the service.  I will be back."}
