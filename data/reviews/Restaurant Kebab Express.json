{"text":"Turkish style Sandwich Restaurant. Went twice, the first and the last.

If it wasn't for the amount of time you must wait until your friggin sandwich gets prepared (between 20-25 minutes!) this place may have a modicum of chance with the other dozen or so Middle Eastern sandwich places around the corner. And believe me it is not a busy restaurant. Although one can quip about their mediocre decor or lack thereof, I can only talk positive about the bread they use which is ok, not too fluffy and slightly crispy after it's grilled. Otherwise their other ingredients suck and the sandwich has no real flavour. 

Oh and they change their menu prices quite often and I once got charged the older higher price when it was time to pay. Not cool!  :(("}
{"text":"Came all the way to NDG for some authentic Turkish kebobs. I had the mixed meat plate, which consisted of chicken, lamb and meatball kebab and some salads on the side. Let me just say, the portions are HUGE. One plate was plenty for two people. I couldn't even finish half of it and gave the rest to my boyfriend who was more than happy to devour it for himself. all in all, the kebabs are alright, not bad for turkish/middle eastern kebabs, but not quite worth coming all the way to NDG for either. 
  The price was reasonable, around $14 for the large plate, which can be shared generously among two people."}
{"text":"This place is nothing BUT express. Waited 20 minutes for two Chicken Kebab Sandwich for take out, and I was the only customer during dinner service.

The sandwich was extremely bland, with barely any seasoning, or lack thereof.

One more thing, the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce I saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either.

I won't go as far as recommending McDonald's instead of this place, but Subway is definitely a wiser choice."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this, saying it's as good as Antep (as if)

I took the mixed plate, very little meat and was still hungry.
Close to $20 with a can of coke.
No rice, just some salad and a bulgur type of side.
Bread was good, but meat felt re-heated.

It's only ok if you've had your fill of Shish-Taouk in the city and are in the mood to try something else"}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised with the reviews so far, I thought the food was good. I went with an Armenian friend who recommended it. I went there for lunch and ordered the Iskender kebap, it was amazing, very filling for the price. Starter (which was free) was fresh baguette with a chilli &  mint yogurt dip. All in all...very good, I will go there again."}
{"text":"Average Turkish/Middle Eastern cuisine place for kebabs. The food prep time is atrocious (almost 30 mins) and the food isn't extraordinary. I wouldn't go back. Farhat is a better option which is also on CDN."}
{"text":"Average. I ordered the sandwich with lamb sandwich combo with salad and a soda.  The sandwich is blunt. The portion of salad is generous. I can't finish the sandwich so I tried to pick the meat out of the bread and I found a suspicious hair probably a eyelash. 
The worst part was that the owner wouldn't give us the receipt and charged five dollar more than what we should pay. I even asked did he include the tips in the bill. After he \"\"realized\" he charged more. He said he thought we order one more soda. What soda worth 5 dollars? That's totally a lie. He is not a honest man and he acted like it was our fault not telling him we took only two soda. I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh yani ! When you can't find authentic Turkish food it's like you have no choice but to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent, but unfortunately you can't eat anything good here . First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be but unfortunately it does not work that way , Now is the restaurant busy ? Ya kind of but with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is . 
People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec .
Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages. Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate :))))) 
Is the place clean yes it is but then again that does not make the food good, 
Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York but I have no hopes ,why I don't have hopes?  Because who wants to invest in Montreal ? They rather go to Toronto Vancouver etc where they don't have to put up with tax or French bs. 
Thank you for reading my review"}
