{"text":"Spinach in Tonkinese Soup is a no for me.

I definitely won't use the word \"Authentic\" to describe this place."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Kate's review, though I will be more critical in mine.

I've heard the dim sum here is great, however I am only going to comment on the dinner service as I have yet to try the dim sum.

The first thing I noticed from the menu is that Chez Ping is noticeably much more expensive than other Chinese restaurant I've been to. The prices of the dishes vary between 13$-23$, but the portions are smaller if not the same comparing to other restaurants. I am willing to pay a lot for good food, but 16$ for a dish of stir-fried vegetable with bean curd, it better be the best vegetable I've ever had in my life. The second thing I noticed is that they really don't have much dishes for a Chinese restaurant.

I do applaud the Mayo Chicken & Shrimp, it tasted very nice, the proteins were moist, and the shrimps were properly prepared. The broccoli tasted slightly undercooked, and was just bland and pretty much ignored. However, this was the only dish that gave me a positive feeling about this place.

The Steamed Tilapia had an earthy aftertaste and was way overcooked, it was not even comparable to any steamed fish I've had before. On my way out after dinner, I noticed that their fishtanks were extremely dirty, covered with green algae and other microbes.

Other dishes either tasted under-seasoned and/or overcooked, nothing too impressive. At the end, we paid 236$ for 12 dishes and a bowl of rice, which is not worth at all given the service and the quality of the dishes.

We waited in line for about 20 minutes to get served by the waiters; the long wait was not because the place was fully booked, but because many tables were not cleaned after the diners have left. Even after being seated, the waiters ignored us for a good 20 minutes before taking our orders. I don't blame him, he had a good attitude, and it was a demanding task for TWO waiters to serve TWENTY-THREE tables.

We ended up waiting 36 minutes for food.

The service was bad, the food quality was below average, and the place is overpriced. This place is \"on par with places in Manhattan's Chinatown\"? The guy who gave a 5-star ratings for this place must have been locked in a cage for the past 30 years and this restaurant was the first thing he encountered after being released.

All kidding aside, don't ever come to this place, take the metro or drive to Chinatown, trust me it's worth it."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese restaurant  in LaSalle,  with a mix of canadianized dishes and what appears to be hk  style dishes.  We ordered for delivery,  less than 45 minutes,  prices good for LaSalle.  Unfortunately,  will not allow dim sum to be ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to this Chinese restaurant twice now when visiting my uncle in Montreal. He really likes it but I'm not quite sure why. The food is fine not really didn't strike me as amazing. The service is a bit weird... On my recent visit it seems like the later was telling us not to order the item that we ordered. We ordered it and then everybody in the restaurant looked at us like we were crazy. Not sure what that was all about. I guess they didn't know white people knew about broccoli."}
{"text":"J'ai été chez Ping à deux reprises et je compte bien y retourner. Les \"lendemains\" de fêtes, y'a rien qui remet \"sul piton\" comme un festin chinois.

Bien que certains plats ne soient pas à la hauteur de mes attentes, les aliments sont frais et leur préparation est satisfaisante!

Les prix sont raisonnables et le menu offre une grande sélection de mets traditionnels chinois, Szechuanais et thaïlandais. 

Le service est poli et très rapide.. Parfois un peu trop (quand ils veulent prendre notre commande).

Les wonton dans la soupe sont rien de moins qu'incroyables!!! 

Mes recommandations:
- soupe wonton 
- boeuf au sésame / poulet général tao (très similaires)
- chow mein cantonais
- Dim sum pour le brunch du dimanche!!

Chin chin!!"}
{"text":"Usually, I'm skeptical of randomly placed Chinese restos. This one is no exception--it shares a building with Super C. That to me is weird. 

But to my surprise, very decent Canto food. I find it $2-3 more expensive per dish than expected compared with other Chinese food places. Our uncle waiter was really friendly and originally from Hong Kong so we chatted with him in Cantonese.  We ordered the 4-dish combo and added an extra dish. That came out to $83+tx. Rule of thumb is to order one dish per person when sharing and throw in a request for a large bowl of rice. 

The starter is a complementary bowl of carrot, greens, pork broth \"soup\". Yes, Asians like thin soup :P  Then our food was served up pretty quick: salt & pepper white chicken, crispy garlicky fried shrimps (which were really good), bitter melon black bean beef, stir fried greens, and deep fried battered fish.  Meal concluded with a complementary taro tapioca dessert soup. 

Overall good enough that I'd actually go back!"}
{"text":"I just realized I hadn't updated this review. We've since been to Chez Ping at least another 3 times (again, because my in-law's like it and it's just conveniently located for them :)) and I truly believe they improved in the past year we lived in Montreal.  The steamed fish definitely improved. We even had our baby's 1-month celebration here and the service and food was great!

Perhaps management does read these reviews and work on making changes (at least I'd like to think so)."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal over the weekend for a little RnR and a relative had recommended this restaurant for Dim Sum. It's in the southern part of Montreal in a neighborhood called LaSalle.
Let me tell you it was on par with places in Manhattan's Chinatown.
Their shrimp noodle is nice and fresh, especially the way the noodle is made.  It is silkier than most places.
The shrimp dumplings were nice and fat.  I recommend their fire roasted suckling pork plate. The meat was nice and lean and the crispy skin was excellent.
Shrimp sui mi is amazing. I recommend the dry sticky rice as well, love that stuff, but save it for last as it is very heavy and if you have it first you will not want to eat anythinge else.
Their sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf was also quite yummy (filled with bits of ground prok, chinese sausage, dried shrimp and half a hard boiled egg.  
This place has the best dim sum in Montreal in my humble opinion.
Decor is nice, with just enough chinese touches without being too overdone :-)"}
{"text":"I don't want to sound mean and all, but this was worst than I thought. I went there once and didn't enjoy it very much, but I didn't remember why. Everything kept disappointing me by the minute. When it was finally time to drink my favourite shark/crab fin soup, I had my hopes up but it had absolutely no taste at all and the lobster had no meat. It doesn't help that I really dislike Chinese food though."}
{"text":"Pretty good Cantonese style Chinese restaurant. Right in front of a supermarket. 
We had an 10 course meal. So I can say I had a good cross cut of their food. I won't talk about each course but the notable ones. Their suckling pig was great and the crab and lobster were good. 
They also had this mayonnaise chicken fried with shrimp that was interesting. I have never seen that dish anywhere and I have been to more Chinese restaurants than most."}
{"text":"I saw some good reviews so I thought I would try it. I ordered #42 beef with vegetables in black bean sauce. Picture looked nice with red peppers etc. What I got was sliced beef (ok) with onions (ok) and only green peppers (not ok. Too bitter if not including red peppers). No sauce. It was in about 3/4 cup of water (I am not kidding). I should have brought it back to get a refund. Instead I will never order from them again. If they do not know the difference between a sauce and a soup then there is no hope for them."}
