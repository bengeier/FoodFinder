{"text":"This is my favorite lunch or break spot on far west side. Very good coffee, good deli items and you can have grocery items too. Very clean and nice staff."}
{"text":"This is a very, very nice grocery store; it reminds me of the HEB chain in Texas. The store is spotless and the staff are beyond friendly/helpful. They have a large selection of everything, including brands that oftentimes will not be stocked by other stores because of the price. They also have a nice deli/fresh food section that has lunch specials throughout the week. In the back of the store is a gluten-free, organic, etc. area that also has a good amount of choices. Do be wary, Metcalfe's is definitely on the pricier side of most grocery stores, but I am happy to pay for quality and a nice shopping experience."}
{"text":"I usually only come here for the fresh meat, deli, seafood and produce selection, although they do have some interesting exclusive and high-quality items in the rest of the store that you can't get anywhere else in Madison.  I went here for doughnuts yesterday, as my regular place was closed, and I had no complaints and the price was reasonable.  The French Bread I grabbed for dinner was excellent.  However, all in all, I wouldn't do the bulk of my shopping here due to the prices, but for what I come for it's pretty good.  The only comparable places in Madison are Whole Foods, Brennan's, Willy St. Co-op, and maybe Trader Joe's, that all have their own pros and cons."}
{"text":"I like going to different grocery stores and trying them out until I find something I really like from each store. As such I would find myself going to different stores every weekend to get a bunch of stuffs from each of them.  For Metcalfe's it is their huge selection of meat, especially steak, pork and lamb. They have all the different cuts, including the usual rib eye, lamb ribs, steak etc to the not-so-typical liver, stomach, kidneys, tails etc. More than enough options to satisfy my creativity in cooking!   It doesn't take a lot to realize they are more on the upscale end. Your everyday items are going to cost more than the nearby target and copps. For someone with the spending ability for healthier options, vegan options, organic options etc, this would be a good place for all your needs. Until I find a real job one day ~~~~ *wistful look*"}
{"text":"There are challenges in Madison finding a coffee shop with really good coffee, clean atmosphere, and attentive staff. The cafe at Metcalfe's suffers none of these.  The staff is great, the coffee (True coffee roasters), is better brewed than that of True coffee locations (especially the one in Fitchburg). They also have tea and a tons of other specialty beverages I don't drink but maybe I'll expand my palate some day. Pete does a great job leading things and it's obvious he has a personal commitment to his work."}
{"text":"I'm in love. I'm going to give this grocery store the highest praise I can - it's a cross between Brennan's (great fruit but mainly noncommercial items) and HyVee (great Iowa grocery store with normal items). I love the mix of items, the great looking fruit and Oberweis milk (I miss their Illinois stores with delicious ice cream too). It's really not that expensive and I can get everything all in one place. I was worried given the caliber of grocery stores I've found but this is the real deal. The people were nice and I'll be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to grocery shop. They have all of the high end produce and organic foods that you would expect from a place like Whole Foods, but at a more reasonable price. On top of that, they still carry all of the normal items you would expect to see at a grocery store. If you live within 15 mins of this store, you need to grocery shop here. Do It!"}
{"text":"The Good Lots of local food Delicious pre-made food options Pretty decent bakery  The Bad Not a lot of options for staples A little hard to navigate  The Ugly Price are sometimes just too high for my taste"}
{"text":"Don't bother with the coffee shop. It's a waste of money as the workers don't bother to make what you ordered. Starbucks in the Target or the Farmers Market is your best bet."}
{"text":"Today's review is for the floral shop at Metcalfe's - I worked with Sally Rossmiller for flowers for my wedding, and she absolutely outdid herself with the arrangements she created!  I had a very specific look I wanted, and she was able to take the cute Pinterest photos I provided as inspiration and create truly spectacular arrangements using the elements I loved.  She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!!   The flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of. Sally also had some great ideas that contributed to our day, as I probably wouldn't have gone hunting for vintage lace for my bouquet handle without prompting.  It made a lovely addition.  I can't recommend her work more highly, and I am so happy with the addition they made to our special day."}
{"text":"WOW!!  My boyfriend and I LOVE this place.  It is a treat for us.  We get lost in the cheese section for way too long.  The fresh fish, bakery and produce are just amazing.  Love the selection and atmosphere.  It is not in our neighborhood, so we don't shop here every week, but we try to go in once a month for some fun."}
{"text":"This is not only a grocery store, it's a staple in the community. Tim and Kevin Metcalfe have kept the tradition alive! Yes, this store is pricier than others but you do indeed get what you pay for. The Metcalfes also give back more to the community that all the rest of the grocery retailers combined!  This is a good hearted family running an excellent local grocery store."}
{"text":"I wondered for a year if this place would ever get up to speed. It seemed like the conversion from Cub Foods to Metcalfe's took forever - and every time I went, I left disappointed (because it wasn't even close to the fabulousness that is their Hilldale store).  Well, glory hallelujah - it's finally finished! It's much larger than the Hilldale store - in fact, it feels almost cavernous by comparison. But that's not a dig - there's nothing I hate more than an overcrowded grocery store. The lighting is interesting - spotlit in the fresh food areas and deli, with standard overhead lighting in the supermarket aisles.  Now, I have to say, I haven't done a \"full shop\" at Metcalfe's - and probably won't. Their prices on standard grocery items are MUCH higher than those at other stores in the area (Woodman's, most notably). But frankly, I don't think that's why one shops at Metcalfe's. It's for the lovely produce, great bakery and top-notch specialty items, as well as the terrific deli and ready-to-eat foods (soups, salad bar, etc). One of my very favorite things is that they always have chopped or shredded rotisserie chicken on their salad bar. Sometimes I by-pass the salad and just get a container of chicken - a welcome short-cut to a homemade frittata, risotto, or gumbo. (Of course, I probably shouldn't have mentioned that - because now everybody will do as I do, leaving me SOL when I need chicken.)  In fact, I've developed a little Sunday ritual - grabbing a latte at a nearby coffee shop, then stopping into Metcalfe's for a little \"coffee and\" from their wonderful selection of local, artisanal pastries. It's a lovely moment of tranquility before I dive back into the work week."}
{"text":"This grocery store is constantly out of stock of wayyyyy too many items. At least half the time I go there, several of the items I am looking for are out of stock. Not only that, but the store is over-priced and not well laid out. Additionally, other patrons in the store seem to think they own the isles and aren't considerate of their fellow shoppers. The ONLY reason I stop back in from time to time is the convenient location, right next to Target, and close (relatively) to downtown."}
{"text":"This is my go-to grocery store.    Yes, it might be a little higher priced than other grocery store options in Madison, but the customer service, quality, and variety of food is worth it.  They have a good selection of local foods in pretty much every section of the store and they are easy to spot because they are market with the distance the food traveled to get there!   Their deli, cheese, meat and seafood counters really don't compare to anywhere else that I go.  The selection is large, the staff is knowledgeable, and the food is delicious. The cheese section in particular blows me away with the variety every time.   Aside from the some higher prices the only thing that I really can say bad about this place is that the parking lot is a mess if you come when it is busy - but that might have to do more with the mall and Target than the actual grocery store."}
{"text":"Convenient place to shop near home. Prices are comparable to Whole Foods. Great meat/seafood dept. they carry several local brands which I love."}
{"text":"Very clean store, lovely produce and meat sections.  Enjoy the classical music while shopping.  The prices aren't very competitive with other markets, but the shopping experience is generally relaxing.  One problem: shopped there today and groceries were bagged by Karen L., whose nametag revealed she was an employee with 9+ years of experience.  She put eggs in the bottom of a paper bag and proceeded to pile over ten pounds of meat on top of it.  Handing us the bag, she advised the eggs were on the bottom!! Like most stores these days, no understanding of bagging protocol --or physics.  When I asked to please have a separate bag for the eggs--crickets as a response.  This is not an unusual experience at Metcalfe's, unfortunately--just the first time to complain about an otherwise pleasant experience. If I hadn't grabbed the bread from her, I am sure that would have been part of the bottom of another bag."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why anyone would go here. The prices are absolutely astronomical!!! Whole Foods gets a bad rap but honestly, the same products are available there for way less money. Take Barbara's cereals-- $6.09 at Metcalfe's. That's right, SIX dollars. For cereal. At WF, the same cereal is $4.99. And then there is the ice cream aisle. One would imagine that this place would carry premium ice cream, being that it kind of touts itself as gourmet. Wrong! It's all garbage. The only semi good brand is Sassy Cow and again, guess what? More than six dollars per container!! The bakery section is gross, too. I'm sure the booze and meats and cheeses are probably great but after seeing what they charge for fairly basic products I am not sure why anyone would go here when WF is 100 percent natural and costs less."}
{"text":"I was relieved to find a good quality grocery store in Madison since the city seemed to be flooded with barely mediocre supermarkets.  Metcalfe's has it all, variety, fresh produce, beautiful presentation of their products, and a great deli. Metcalfe's employees seem to actually enjoy their job. All except for one sad, pissed off security guard who seems to get some sort of sick satisfaction out of harassing as many people as he can.  My husband stopped at the curb to run in a grab some milk. I stayed in the car with our two sleeping children. I was there for less than 2 minutes when I was startled by an angry knock at the window. I cracked the door to some bitter, 20 something security guard who obviously hated his life. He greeted me with a very rude, \"WHY ARE YOU PARKED HERE?\" I explained the circumstance while the below negative temperatures creeped to the backseat where my sick children were sleeping but now stirring. \"WELL YOU CAN'T PARK HERE EVER AGAIN!!!\" He replied in a beyond unprofessional tone. He then walked away to harass the car behind me in the same manner. My 3 year old, now completely awake, asked me, \"Was that a bad stranger Mommy?\"  As soon as my husband got back (literally 30 seconds later) he knew exactly who I was talking about. He, too, had been a victim of the lonely, pissed off security guard.  As soon as that guy gets fired, I will give Metcalfe's their 5th star."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Metcalfe's.... I mean come on... who doesn't love low Grocery costs and TONS of samples! The people who work here are incredible and are always really helpful when trying to find something. It's a grocery store so I can't say too much but I always love coming here for some reason to get groceries."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this store and wish I had found it sooner! I prefer this location to the Hilldale one since parking is easier and the store is less hectic.  At the Hilldale location, I have literally had to wait 15-20 minutes at times for the deli counter.  I don't know about you, but I don't need lunch meat that badly.    They carry Boar's Head lunch meat and will ask you how you like it sliced.  Their produce is amazing, and to be honest, doesn't cost much more than the local store that is known for including free fruit flies with their produce.  You don't have to worry about needing to throw it away after 3 days, so your money is saved right there.  They have an amazing bakery section and also an amazing cheese selection.  You can find quality butcher meats on sale for very reasonable prices as well if you watch their ads.  I haven't tried their various salad bars, but everything looks really fresh.    I would say that this is the best grocery store in Madison."}
{"text":"This grocery store is so clean, it's always busy and busy with people and a ton of traffic on the weekends. It's a bit pricey here but I'm sure couponing would do some good here! Anyway, I went to the café and ordered 2 frappé's one white chocolate or white mocha (something like that) and one mocha and the regular mocha was not good, I don't recommend ordering that one. Service was fast and efficient and lots of open seats. I come in when I'm on the west side of town to grab a few items. They have some local foods here which is great, a nice deli area, and produce section. The store is very clean and there's always someone available to help. After a lot of remodeling, this place looks really nice. I'm impressed. I wish the parking lot was bigger or not so cramped but it does the job I guess. Anyway, if you need to grab a few things, this would be a good place to stop."}
{"text":"It's nice a neat here. Just currently under construction near the registers so that kind of sucks. Looks like they are redoing their self-checkout area. Which was bad timing for me because I really didn't feel like socializing. Hahaha. Anyway, the items here are pretty pricey but they have good deals every now and then. They have a nice deli and produce area as well. Also, I really like their floral section!!"}
{"text":"Straight up, this store is generally too expensive for my budget. I'm a student, and I just can't afford to make it my main despite the awesome and fresh goods it offers. I'm writing this review to let the world know about one thing here: $5 S-U-S-H-I. Go full on basic and pick up fresh $5 rolls here on Wednesdays with your besties, grab a bottle of wine, and go soak it up with some Netflix. My personal favs are the crispy crab roll and the spicy wasabi roll with spicy tuna and crunchy wasabi on top. All veg options available too!    Note: only some rolls are $5, and they generally stay the same week to week. Not a deterrent enough for me because they're so cheap and so GD satisfying."}
{"text":"Your bakery department sucks big time. You charge ridiculous prices on your desserts that are made just not right. Well we tried almost every item, EASY ON A SUGAR GUYS, YOUR STUFF IS WAY TOOOOOO SWEET.  We love the rest of the store though, deli snd sushi are great. GL"}
{"text":"I have only been here once so far and that was because a little birdie told me they have sushi for $4.99 on Wednesdays.  For that price, it was worth a shot!  Let's just say I now regret knowing this tidbit of information because now I will have to adjust my weekly budget since I live so close.  I thought the sushi was very good for \"supermarket sushi\" and well worth my $5.  I would even pay the full price for it.  Many of the rolls come with 10 pieces.  I found the Tokyo Fantasy roll to be my favorite.  Just beware that the $4.99 sushi is only the ones that have the big red sticker with \"Sushi Wednesday\" on it (this was unclear to me the first time around), though this doesn't necessarily mean the options are super limited.  There seemed to be something for everyone that fell under the Sushi Wednesday special.  I also have to say that the gentlemen at the sushi counter were very friendly and welcoming.  I shall return for more sushi in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"We go there for most of our fresh foods, it doesn't have the feel of a neighborhood grocer but the quality and selection are terrific."}
{"text":"Reviewed in a contextual vacuum, Metcalfe's would get 5 stars from me no question. Easily one of the best \"fresh\" and \"gourmet\" markets I've visited. But what did I say about context? Next to Whole Foods, it simply falls short in produce, seafood, and meat, my three key sources of food. There's just way more grass-fed beef and organic, free-range chicken, etc., at Metcalfe's competitor 5 minutes away. This tips the scale for Whole Foods, considering the prices are about the same. The coffee bar also closes way too early.  One place where M has Whole foods beat? The CHEESE department is unreal, just way more selection, and I know people who go there solely for this."}
{"text":"This place is like heaven to me. Yes, it's a little overwhelming. Yes, it's a little overpriced. But that spells the makings to a great grocery store to me! The selection is second to none...especially for us gluten free folk. Produce is phenomenal. And if you haven't tried them yet their marinated chicken breasts turn a normally boring meal into a flavor explosion. (Seriously, try them.) If there's something specific you're looking for, you're bound to find it here.  Only things I'd say they can improve upon: 1. The deli counter. I know it's supposed to be super good quality deli meats but every single time I've gotten some they are pretty dry. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong kind? (Suggestions anyone?)  2. The sushi area. I've never actually tried it but it always looks a little scary.  3. The prepared foods section. I tried getting a salad or something here once and the man working behind the counter had no idea what was in anything. Since I'm gluten intolerant this can be pretty important.   But even with these negatives, I keep coming back and actually look forward to going grocery shopping!"}
{"text":"I'm a die hard Metcalfe's fan, and I recently became even a bigger fan of this location. They have so many gluten free options - even a bigger selection than the location at Hilldale, I think. It's also all in one place, which makes it easier to shop instead of searching and searching around the store."}
{"text":"I like the variety of items availible and the number of Wisconsin produced product.  The prices can be hit and miss.  Some of the items, some of the time are very well priced.  Some times the prices are very high in comparison.  It is a great place of one stop shopping and finding some of the best available products."}
{"text":"After my wedding reception, I have to take a star away from my previous review of Metcalfe's.   For our cocktail hour, I chose Metcalfe's to provide some appetizer trays as they were on my venue's preferred caterer list and I had experience of their quality product. It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.  Come the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call \"Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff.\" \"But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,\" says Metcalfe's dude. \"I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you.\" \"Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event.\" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. \"YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!\" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.  Later (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).  The food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed.   All in all, the appetizers from Metcalfe's were delicious. But the service was ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is a review for their catering services specifically.  We got this catered for a party, and we ordered a couple of different trays: sandwiches, sushi, meat/veggies and dessert  Sandwich: not super great - it's your typical simple sandwich platter with a couple of different cold cut options (ham, roast beef), and it comes in pita bread. It wasn't special, and the pita bread was a bit dry. Also comes with tomato and lettuce.  Sushi: this was very average sushi, which I'm not expecting anything high quality because it's a grocery store. Had some veggie rolls in here as well  Meat/Veggies: this was pretty decent. It came with a couple of different meats (salami, prosciutto), and some veggies (olives, peppers, artichoke). This most resembled a simple characturie board.   Dessert: came with strawberries, brownies, a lemon cake/pastry and coconut/chocolate bar type of dessert. This was yummy! Can't go wrong with dessert.  Overall, I think it was fine and decent for catering to a large group."}
{"text":"I love Metcalfes! We used to shop at the Hilldale location but it's a bit too far from us to be convenient. My wife and I really did not like the old Cub Foods but Metcalfes Market is totally remodeled and the quality has increased across all departments in the store. It's our first choice for grocery shopping because of the fresh produce and meat. The selection is excellent for a store of it's size. The staff is helpful and friendly as well. It's well worth your time to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love this grocery store!! It's always so clean. I can find what I need very easy. The workers seem to really enjoy being here. I like that feeling that they care about my business. Hubs loves the meat here especially"}
{"text":"I love food, and even the act of grocery shopping is among my favorite things to do. Metcalfe's has impressed me since it's been open, especially that gorgeous produce section and much-better-than-average musical selection (classical). Madison has a pretty awesome food selection, from the farmers' market to the Willy Street Co-op to, yes, Whole Foods, but Metcalfe's mostly holds its own.  They could use more local and organic food, but they do have a large selection and I give them huge props for creating such a pleasant atmosphere. Plus they're open late, so I can go shopping at midnight - my favorite time!"}
{"text":"I recently used their On the GO service and not a great first time experience.  A couple of items were not included and they said they would return.  I explained I was going to order some additional items so they could wait and include in that order.  I called and asked if I could add deli items and they said I could call the morning of the delivery and add them.  I later found out that was not the case.  I needed to give them at least 2-3 days if not more notice.  I decided to just get a credit for the items I did not get, which I need to wait 5 days because the manager is not in until then.  I will most likely not use the service again.  I will continue to shop in the stores because I have always been pleased with products/service."}
{"text":"I have never been very impressed with Metcalfs.  I have always found then to be Overpriced, under stocked, rude and bad value for my money. I have always found Woodman's Markets clean, well stocked and a great value.  If I need something special or fancy I go to Costco or HYVEE.  Just because they claim that they have so many local products, I have found that they overcharge go those same products that I can get cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Metcalfe's offers the best fresh seafood selection in Madison; leaps and bounds above all other options to choose from! It's rare to find them (Midvale location) out of a certain item, or having something in their case that doesn't appear to have been caught in the last 12 hours. I make a commitment to always visit this location when I'm in the mood for fresh seafood & produce!"}
{"text":"Metcalfe's, what is this? I am new to Madison and everyone can't stop talking about what an experience it is to shop here. It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.  It was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).  Safeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.  Of course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).  As for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.  Whole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone)."}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to grocery store! Had heard mixed reviews over the years but after finally taking a trip over I don't understand why at all! Fair prices, great quality food, clean store, helpful staff!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be rich?  Be more refined?  You know, go to high-end fancy shmancy places?    My friend, welcome to the place where millionaires shop for groceries.    Okay, I have no idea if that statement is accurate.  But, how many grocery stores do you go to that play classical music?    This place pays a lot of attention to detail and it shows.  The store is very clean, bright, well laid out, and bears a friendly staff that is eager to help.  The produce department is world-class, with fresh clean produce that doesn't disappoint.    I think what I appreciate the most about this place is the huge deli and prepared foods section.  If you're in need of a ready made meal or something hot and tasty, this is the place to get it.    One downside is the selection.  The store and aisles are too small to accommodate a large selection, so don't expect to find 13 different brands of canned diced tomatoes.  But they do have a generic brand for most items.    The prices are a bit high, but not unreasonable.  In this case, you're paying more for the shopping experience and the quality of products.    Also, parents, they have nice carts with attached cars.  Plus a tiny cart with a flag on it that says \"Customer in training.\"  When you're shopping with a two year old, that is HUGE.  Bottom line, I like this place a lot.  I just wish their prices were a bit lower.  But I'm willing to pay the premium for the better experience than other stores in town."}
{"text":"Metcalfe's is what all supermarkets should aspire to be.  I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.    They also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!  Every department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep.   During the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that.   Local foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).  The only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers.   Although Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as \"Whole Paycheck\" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.   Tips:    1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.  2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference.   3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied \"gentle\" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for..."}
{"text":"The newly remodeled Metcalfe's are a real treat to visit. I love their focus on sourcing from vendors as local as possible. When I want to purchase local meats, cheeses and other specialty products, I visit Metcalfe's first.  Their deli, salad bar, soups and other pre-made items are delicious. The selection is so vast, it's overwhelming at times!   I always find very friendly and helpful employees in the aisles.   It's also handy to run in to the store whilst shopping at Hilldale."}
{"text":"Bomb ass grocery store. If we need something, this is usually where we'll end up."}
{"text":"Normally I don't think about reviewing grocery stores, but I feel like the meat market at this Metcalfe's deserves a shout out!  Shopped there for the first time yesterday (I'm new to the area);  I was looking for rib-eye steaks to grill for friends.  Not only were they on sale, but the butchers took the time to explain the differences in the various cuts on display (choice to prime to Wisconsin grass-fed).  And when I couldn't find the exact oz. size I wanted per steak (Yes, I was being awfully picky!), the butcher offered to hand cut steaks to my exact specifications!  He even brought out the side of beef so that I could choose from the less to more marbled end (I chose the more marbled side).  The steaks were absolutely delicious, they cooked beautifully.  My guests said they were \"Ruth's Chris\" quality!  I couldn't be more appreciative for such personalized service."}
{"text":"This review is for the floral department here and the manager, Diane.  We had our wedding in Madison and spent the months leading up to it trying to plan everything from LA. I've never planned anything of the sort and had no idea what I was doing, what we needed in terms of floral arrangements, or what anything was called. I was also crazy skeptical at first because let's face it... it's a flower shop in a grocery store.   After getting in touch with Diane and letting her know what kind of theme we wanted to go with (based on a pre-arranged bouquet they sell), she was wonderful and super helpful, giving us different options to choose from for our arch. The prices given to us were pretty fair too. Over the course of the entire planning process, Diane always responded quickly and answered all of our questions each time we thought of something new to worry about. She was also able to deliver and personally set everything up for us Sunday morning, basically giving us so much more time to prepare other things in an otherwise impossible day.  In the end, our reaaaaalllllyy cheap and crappy arch, which could've been serious disaster, turned out beautifully thanks to the gorgeous floral swags she put together for us. My bridal bouquet was equally perfect and I wish I could have brought it home with us. Such a great experience and would highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love how fresh their produce is. Everything is very organized and easy to find. The music they play is relaxing and the employees and very helpful/well informed. Their prices vary, many things a little bit more expensive than your mainstream grocery store, however they have great items on sale each week which are very affordable on a budget. It's closer to home for me, so driving else where to pay a little less isn't worth it to me. Also, a big plus is that they regularly have samples throughout the store and have a red box movie rental station."}
{"text":"Great place to shop. Friendly employees who are very helpful. Offers wide variety of products from local providers."}
{"text":"I really love Metcalfe's produce, fresh seafood and ready-to-eat meals.  While I love Willy St. Co-op, the selection of fresh seafood there is scarce, in my opinion. The bigger chain grocery stores around Madison are not better when it comes to fresh seafood. Metcalfe's fish counter is wonderful -- all the fish I've tried has been great quality, reasonably priced (considering that it's fresh/wild-caught) and tasty!  Other than the fish counter, here are my opinions of the rest of the store: - Great deli selection and ready-to-eat meals: I've had the creamy coleslaw and some other salads from the deli counter, and they've all been great. (I like to LOOK AT the ready-to-eat desserts available at Metcalfe's, but I've done a good job avoiding the temptation to buy them, so I can't comment.) - Good and reasonably priced salad bar: I filled up a whole salad container that totaled $5 at the register. ($2.50/person = nice!) The items on the salad bar are fresh. - The aisles are okay: I actually feel that the organic/natural aisles at Woodman's provide better selection than the aisles at Metcalfe's.  - The classical music over the speakers is lovely!  I definitely recommend Metcalfe's to anyone looking for a great selection of produce, fresh seafood and deli/ready-to-eat foods!"}
{"text":"When I am nearby I like to stop in to Mecalfe's Market to walk around and see what they have available.   I have been there over the last couple of months when they are having events which include sampling some delicious things that I normally wouldn't have tried.  Yesterday's event was the chocolate event where there were many different chocolate offers from different companies.  The area where they have the sampling's is pretty crowded and I feel bad for the people who are actually there just to shop.    My husband and two tweens were with me and we didn't mind waiting in the long line. The event was pretty nice and you could try as many chocolates as you would like, at the end was a beer sampling from Wisconsin Brewery which was a bonus.  The only thing I would have changed would have been for the store to have a few more people to cover the sampling area so which would have kept the line moving a bit faster.  Back to the store...this location is very clean and modern looking.  They seem to offer specialty foods to offer in their grocery section, a great bakery section, hit food bar, salad bar, etc.  I generally will just pick up a couple things here and do my grocery shopping elsewhere because the prices tend to be high.     Oh, parking has always been a bit stressful because they seem to have a relatively small lot compared to the size of the store.  I've parked at Target a couple times and walked over, because again I generally do not buy that much."}
{"text":"So impressed with their floral department! I ordered flowers by phone from Minneapolis for someone living locally in Madison and they did an excellent job! The gal i spoke with made suggestions to alter an arrangement listed on their site making an absolutely stunning arrangement!   Prices for average to better (for the size) than other madison florists i looked at online and their website and phone customer service were top notch."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is more expensive and has less selection than some other grocery stores (ahem, Woodman's), but it has it's own thing going on and I dig it.  They have this Food Miles program that tells you how many miles away much of their local items have traveled.  If you like buying local (from produce to New Glarus beers) Metcalfe's makes it super easy.  This particular location is almost finished with a nice remodel, and since it is the closest grocery store to me, I swing by often to grab that pesky item I'm all out of when cooking up a meal.  Also of note, there is a Redbox at this store which I frequent."}
{"text":"The hot bar and asian bar offer some good eats. Be prepared to eat with your fingers though. This store is a beautiful environment but apparently they have chosen to subject its eat in customers to the cheapest flimsy plastic forks knives and spoons I have ever seen."}
{"text":"An excellent grocery store with lovely produce, meat and deli. Just moved here from the west coast and this is the only big grocery in town that doesn't make me feel very very homesick. Produce section includes a big organic section. Products labeled with origin. Prices may be higher but if you watch for the sale items- the prices are good.  Helpful staff. Huge selection of local cheeses. (duh) Bakery seems full of variety, from boring midwest white bread products to many whole grain and local breads/pastries. They will slice anything. I go here when I do not want to be depressed by the other grocery stores in town and want a bigger selection than I can get at the local co-op. One Sunday they had over 40 free sample stations! Might be a regular thing?"}
{"text":"As I prepared to leave my daughter's family with a newborn and return home, I wanted to have some foods delivered to  make life a little easier for them. Metcalfe's confirmed for me on the phone that they do in fact cover our area. I ordered foods online, heard from the online shopping coordinator who had questions about my preferences, and received the order right on time during the bracketed period I had chosen on their website. All the ingredients were very fresh and now there is a kitchen full of food for them to eat during this winter weather. Thanks, Metcalfe's!!  A great experience and I look forward to ordering again soon."}
{"text":"This is the best grocery store in the world. Yes, in the world. I used to live in Madison, and during the 5 years I lived there, I did all my groceries at Metcalfe's. The quality of the fruits, vegetables, milk, is great and they have a good selection of cheese and ethnic food. The deli has some great food, Paleo and vegan friendly options and the price is not as exorbitant as Whole Foods (which is right down the street on University). The staff are very nice and helpful, and the cafe that is adjoining to the grocery store is great. I live in Boston now and fondly think of Metcalfe's!  It used to 24 hours open, which they later changed to midnight."}
{"text":"Very good selection of local foods, nice prepared foods. Prices on the high side but they have quality products here.  I was really disappointed to have read that they've been conducting union-busting while claiming to be a union-friendly business. Sadly I'm going to have to stop shopping here (and I shop here quite often) until they stop mistreating their workers."}
{"text":"Metcalfe's of Madison is a lot like Sendik's of Milwaukee.   I love that they carry Boarshead meats, they slice to order and ask how you like it sliced, and their house-made garlic Italian bread is addictive and soooo good with their roast beef and swiss cheese, add a little brown mustard and a little miracle whip and I am in heaven. I also love that they carry Greenbush Bakery donuts, and their produce is fresh and eclectic."}
{"text":"I'm  a regular shopper here.  The interior and exterior are so much  more appealing than the old Cub Foods that was here. Fantastic deli and quick meal selection. Good bulk food section, wide variety of 'local' food stuff. Never crowded, pleasant employees.  Only negative is price."}
{"text":"If ever there were a real live grinch, It would be the hag (presumably the manager) working 2 days before Christmas.  I was going to buy a bottle of wine, and she came over to let me know in a nasty voice that if I were buying alcohol, I better hurry up.  Well I did, and because the cashier was seriously slow, it was 9:01 when it was my turn at the register.  This woman came over, and snatched the bottle away from the cashier and said something to the effect that I should have hurried up, and they didn't sell alcohol after 9.  The cashier looked really uncomfortable, and mumbled some excuse.    What is it about the holidays that turns people into complete assholes?"}
{"text":"I have been using grocery delivery during my long car repair.  I love it!  Although you don't have the full market accessible, it certainly beats taking a cab there and home and is cheaper than a cab would cost.  I have ordered meat and produce and eggs that were in top condition. People say Pick N Save is cheaper but if you want lesser quality, fine."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best grocery stores in Madison but you have to watch your wallet at the check out.  I was there today and bought organic lemons for .99 cents.  A lot for one lemon, right?  When I was at check out, they range them up as $1.99/lemon.  Over 100% more and I had to wait 10 minutes for the manager to credit back my $2.00.  I just wonder how often this happens.  Plus, I think their organic produce is more expensive than whole foods.  If you have time, shop at Metcalf's for supplies but buy your produce at whole foods or the market.  And be sure to check the prices at the register!!"}
{"text":"I have heard a number of good things about Metcalfes but have never shopped there until today.  Overall it was sort of a mixed bag.   Let me list the reasons why. First the positives:   There is an emphasis on cleanliness right when you enter the store with hand sanitizers and also a clean floor and clean doors.  There is a lot of room which is in contrast to other grocery stores that do not leave enough room for you to shop.  They carry some unique selections on cheese, sausage and other items that you will not find at other stores.   They have a nice bakery, meat counter and deli counter with adequate and knowledgeable staff.  I bought a T-bone steak and it was truly delicious.  Nice bags to carry my groceries home with. The negatives:  Pricey.  I found a number of items that were more than I usually pay for them at my regular grocery.   Disorienting.  One department blends into the next without a clear defining line.  This is only in the outer areas of the store.  Maybe this is something you can get used to if you shop there a lot.  I got some filled doughnuts and they were way too sweet for me.  Too much frosting and too much filling.  One doughnut was difficult to finish.  The bags are so nice but I wonder about their environmental impact and cost. Overall you can tell that people are really working hard here to make this a good store and I am personally glad to have them here in Madison.  But, I get a strange vibe here and don't know for sure what it is.   I love grocery stores, how they tantalize my taste buds and get me to consider buying new items.  I didn't get this here.  Instead I felt led toward high priced items and turned around this way and that.   I almost never shop the middle of the store except for a few items so the outside is what needs to draw me in and keep me coming back for more.  The one thing that did do this was the meat counter.   Their cuts of steak were not only beautiful and thick but the ones I purchased were terrific.   So I will stop back again if only for some steak. Update: They have cleaned up the front area so it is easier to navigate.  This is a really nice store.   I find myself shopping here more for some very good selection and great steaks."}
{"text":"I grew up with this as my neighborhood grocery store so it's got a space in my heart.  I never gave it much thought, though, until I noticed it swanked it up big time in order to beat off the Goliath that is Whole Foods.  Rock out, Sentry.  You'll always be my favorite."}
{"text":"A superior market.  This review is about the AWESOME CHICKEN POT PIE SOUP I bought and took to the coffee shop to enjoy this past Saturday before shopping.  Hearty; perfect flavor; a variety of ingredients..peas; diced potatoes; tender chunks of white meat chicken; some interesting herbs..?  I think Metcalfe's is ONE BIG FIVE STAR WONDERLAND!"}
{"text":"The 2 great spots to eat in or grab to go is located at the coffee cafe and the salad and soup bar. Having worked at lululemon for 3 and a half years, I would go here often to get my meals.   They have a pretty fresh salad selection to choose from and their soups have never let me down!   The people are the coffee bar are very nice as well and they have a punch card system where on Sundays, you get doubles punches! So make sure to go there on Sundays to get extra punches on your card. In the summertime, their mocha frappuccino is excellent!! It has just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"One of the best grocery stores in Madison. Very clean, helpful staff, and excellent selection of products from high end meats and cheeses to all the normal dry goods.   I live on the east side so one of the only downsides is they don't have a Metcalfe's on this side of town. Anytime I am downtown or near hilldale, I make sure to get my groceries at Metcalfe's.  The one other thing I really like that I almost forgot was their support of local farmers/ingredients. Some of the items say how far they traveled to get to the store which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"You have got to train the high school aged staff. That I've brought several (Metcalfes) bags should be a clue I don't want $40 of groceries jammed into two bags that bust before I get in my front door. Don't assume common sense exists, Metcalfes hiring and training people."}
{"text":"Parking can be atrocious.  I feel their fruits/vegetables are solid and their cheese shop really shine.  Appreciate the fact they bring in and feature local goods.  Beyond that, it still feels like it's former self (Sentry Foods).  Call me spoiled but I enjoy the new grocery experience that HyVee and others deliver.  More products.  More services.  More choices."}
{"text":"I love this place, but now that they're not open 24/7 I never go here. They have fantastic quality, but the prices are definitely high. Woodman's is way cheaper, but the produce is hit or miss. The food bar is phenomenal, but they keep getting rid of my favorite stuff. This has never been my regular grocery store, but it was great for late night purchases. After all the stuff involving the owner and Brat Fest I'll probably never shop here again."}
{"text":"Walking down groceries store aisles calms my heart. If I'm having a stressful day I enjoy seeing the variety of canned goods and produce nicely organize. I guess I'm a bit of an OCD.   I've walked through most groceries stores in Madison and Metcalfe's is definitely my favorite. It's cheaper than Festival or Whole Foods and the quality is much higher than Woodman's or Hy-vee. They have lots of small food brands you won't find anywhere else.   It's the customer service here that gives Metcalfe's 5 stars. I was making lasagna and a lady was helping me Emmenthaler cheese. A month later while I was browsing through the cheese section, she came up to me and asked how my lasagna turned out! The checkout staff are also incredibly helpful. One day while the checkout lady was ringing me up, without asking, she called the butcher to make sure the lamb I bought was safe because it was slightly brown from oxidization. I live in downtown and will always make the drive out to Metcalfe's."}
{"text":"Great butcher shop, but the prices on anything not on sale in the rest of the store are out of this world. Get the ad, stop by for meat and any good sale items, and then go to an east side Woodman's for the rest of your stuff.... maybe whole foods for the produce."}
{"text":"I enjoy this store for the variety and the classiness of it! Given that it is located in Hilldale Mall and near the Shorewood Hills neighborhood, Metcalfe's does cater to a fiscally higher-tier clientele. The prices definitely reflect this.   The main reason that I will go here is for the specialty items; i.e. Clasen's Bakery items, deli and sushi. I do not come here for my main shopping but do not forget about it when I want a special treat!"}
{"text":"We have shopped here about once a week for the past 12 years. Great staff and great selection of local goods; it's the practically the only place we shop."}
{"text":"Very nice store, great selection, clean, helpful and friendly staff, when we can't get to hilldale we come here."}
{"text":"I live in Scranton PA and called to order a basket for a dear friend who had just lost his dad. They were amazingly accommodating and took care of everything immediately, following my item requests and price range. What service! Wish I lived close enough to shop there :-)"}
{"text":"One of my go to places in Madison, especially for their produce and for finding the specific something. It is not the cheapest store in Madison but it has a wonderful selection of fresh products and great ready take out dishes. Their specials (Wednesday is sushi day, Friday Fish day) and offers are always great. The store is clean and their staff is very helpful. Free parking is really appreciated. I do love their fast check out line, since I usually have a couple of items instead of a full cart, I appreciate not having to wait. I also like this is a family owned company and their inclusive hiring policy."}
{"text":"I like both locations in Madison - but this specific one I like because of their opening hours, they are fairly long. Their products are always fresh, I absolutely love their produce section and I can almost always find what I am looking for. This is my go to place for Sushi take out, made every day from scratch. Check out their specials!"}
{"text":"It's a lovely store, with high quality products, and reasonable prices for what you get. I wouldn't go there for my weekly shopping, as it is a bit spendy, but once I have my staples, I will go there for different ingredients I can't get elsewhere, sustainable fish, great baked goods, stellar produce, high quality meats. If I want something special, they're one of the first places I go to.  Their policy of highlighting local goods is fantastic. There are little yellow signs in every aisle to point out products made within 150 miles or so, each sign showing where the product was made and how far way it is.  When given a choice between a few products, if I know something supports my community, I will favor it.  It's a very relaxing atmosphere to shop, too. I normally hate food shopping, but it is a pleasant experience, and I feel better when I am in there.  That all goes away, though, in the parking lot, which is too small, and too crowded. I plan my trips for the middle of the day in the hopes to avoid too many people. It is the only bad part about shopping there."}
{"text":"My drink of choice is a dark n' stormy. It requires rum and ginger beer. Ginger beer isn't always the easiest to find....but at Metcalfe's there's ginger beer and even better several OPTIONS of ginger beer.   This is the place to go if you are looking for harder to find items or just to try new things.   Did you know Sabra made about 15 different flavors of hummus. I didn't until I came here! Again it's a place to go if you want OPTIONS! There's almost always a person in the cheese department to answer questions and help you with all your cheese needs.   I don't do all my shopping here since the items did to be a bit more on the expensive side, but it's always a treat and a trip that I enjoy."}
{"text":"I could try to put some spin on things and say I'm thrifty, but when it comes right down to it I am cheap. I clip coupons, shop sales, and generally go generic. For some things, though, I'll treat myself. Metcalfe's will probably never be my main market, but it's got some good finds.   My most recent stop was to find local items for a picnic I was hosting for Concerts on the Square, and Metcalfe's does excel at offering lots of local brands. Their in-house deli and bakery are also of good quality (holler back sprinkle brick!), and for being a smaller store their cheese game is on point. I was able to find several cheese orphans at a good price to sample, conveniently arriving just as their cheesemonger was dropping off a new batch.  There were some frustrations (no non-saltine store-brand crackers for my cheese, for instance), but to be fair the average Metcalfe's shopper probably isn't cruising for generic deals and will just pay the extra fifty cents for a name brand.   The store is clean and fairly easy to navigate, and the classical music piped overhead is a heavy-handed touch that I find oddly relaxing. Perhaps someday I'll find myself spending more time among the brand names."}
{"text":"I have an obsession with this particular location's triple chocolate brownies. Dense and fudgy, studded with chocolate chunks and topped with ganache, this is one of my favorites. It doesn't really remind me of a brownie so much as a slab of chocolate. Metcalfe's other location sells an item with the same name, but in the couple of times I've bought it it's been an entirely different product - a cakey brownie with thick, sweet, chocolate frosting.   Yes, Metcalfe's is on the pricey side, but for a few select items it's worth the extra scratch to get something a cut above the competition."}
{"text":"One of the Best grocery stores in town. It's clean and well stocked. Marvin is one of the best front end managers in the business.   It's a bonus that they offer and promote local Wisconsin products. They have a good meat, fish, and deli section. Their beer, wine, and liquor section has really good breath and is competitively priced. While the liquor section is only available until 9PM, the store is otherwise open 24 hours a day. Drive up is also available as is online ordering and delivery."}
{"text":"Looks nice but you will pay for it. Way to expensive for what you get. No worries many options to choose from near by. They scream about being local but they really dont partner with local businesses. Save a bunch by just crossing the parking lot or even the street. Just look both ways first."}
{"text":"They have become increasingly upscale over time, which is a good thing in my book.  However, the end result is extremely pricey.  On a recent trip, cauliflower was $2.49/lb, and organic cauliflower $4.29/lb. An average size NON-organic cauliflower prices out at $6.00  At Woodman's, a regular cauliflower is $1 on the same day."}
{"text":"I've been going here for nearly a decade. Their meat section has definitely improved! They sell even the \"throw away\" cuts! I love organ meats and the odd bits and quality items are difficult to find in the Madison area! Their cheese section is quite good as well; they sell small ends left over from packaging cheese and it's a great way to try new cheeses!   I do miss when they were open 24 hours. They also used to sell Bawls (favorite energy drink!) but I haven't seen it here for a few years now.    Over-all, I'd come here for more uncommon meat cuts, cheeses, and their excellent selection of fresh produce. Oh! And their to-go sushi is actually very good! I have never had a problem with their quality!"}
{"text":"Slow service at the butcher counter, meat was sloppily wrapped, and the butcher tried to make me feel badly for buying organic (\"expensive\") meat."}
{"text":"Visualize a Pick n' Save. The assistant manager boredly gazes out the window at the parking lot and sees me approach. \"Quick! Scott's coming! Put Phil Collins on the speakers!\" Me entering the store: *sigh*. \"Fuckin' Phil Collins.\"  I can think of no other explanation because I've heard Phil Collins on every grocery store trip I've ever made in my life, EXCEPT when I go to Metcalfe's!!! They play classical. It is so refreshing to not have to listen to shit-ass 80's soft pop when I shop.  The place is never as crowded as other places can be. All those people who are clueless about personal space: blocking aisles while they dick around on their phone, blocking doors while they check their reciept, reaching between your legs to grab a can of green beans. Those guys all hang out at Woodman's.   The store has a nice ambiance too. It's darker, not bleach-white and lit like a surgeon's table.   This place calms me.   They specialize in fancy prepared stuff, like artisan crackers, olives. cakes. It does those things well.  As for regular food, the selection is not quite as good as a Phil Collins supermarket. The prices are a bit higher as well. A lot of produce is only available as organic."}
{"text":"What a stellar local sweets section! That island near the registers... I know you put it there for people like me to fill their healthy cart with sweets at the last moment. GODDAMN YOU FOR BEING SO RIGHT.  Madison's own Gail Ambrosius & Candinas chocolates, and Christine's Gourmet Toffee. Sweet Monkees cookies and Eastside Ovens vegan cookies (chocolate chip/peanut butter chocolate chip heyoo) all from Milwaukee. Shopping local never tasted so suhhhhweeeeeet!"}
{"text":"Pros: High-quality speciality products, good sushi Cons: Premium prices  Metcalfe's feels like a local Whole Foods. So if you like Whole Foods, you will probably like Metcalfe's. The only things I buy here are quality bread, cheese, and grab-n-go sushi that I can't easily find elsewhere. Some common items (ie. canned goods) they sell at a lot higher prices than other markets."}
{"text":"When I need to do my weekly grocery shopping (and wine shopping and household supply shopping) this is where I head. Great produce, friendly staff, and fresh meat/seafood.   Plus, who doesn't love being asked \"Paper or Plastic?\""}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Metcalfes I'm hoping it will be as good as the one at Hilldale, and every time I leave disappointed!  Two biggies:  (1) The fish counter.  C'mon, you've been open over a year but its about 1/3 the size of the one at Hilldale!  (2) The deli (sliced meat) counter-- at Hilldale there will be 3 people behind the counter, 6 customers being served, and you can get what you need in no time.  At this Metcalfes, there will be 4 people behind the counter (2 doing who-knows-what-- wrapping something up, fiddling around with something), 2 customers being served, and it takes FOREVER to get through.  That second point touches on the biggest complaint I have about this store relative to the Hilldale store: Service.  The Hilldale folks have this locked down-- serve the customer first!  The folks working at this Sentry have not been in their positions as long and really don't seem to have this same mindset."}
{"text":"I wrote in my review for Woodman's that if Heaven had 2 grocery stores Woodman's would be one of them. Well, the other would be Metcalfe's, and for completely different reasons. I adore this place and have not come across any grocery store like it, which bums me out.  Whereas I love Woodman's because of it's huge food selection and cheap prices what makes Metcalfe's my celestial food emporium is it's dedication to serving quality and local products. Their Food Miles is a clear sign (literally) of its dedication to push local products. Since I moved to Madison five years ago I've become very interested in where my food comes from and try very hard to buy products that are locally-made--not just for health reasons but to support the local economy. Well, Metcalfe's makes my mission so much easier by not only stocking up on local products (so nice that I can get Marieke Gouda, fruit and vegetables from local farms, Clasens bread, Sassy Cow milk, Usingers sausage, Greenbush donuts, and Babcock ice cream all in one place) but also labeling them with a nice big sign so that I know from where they come.   Additionally, almost all of the counter staff I encountered over the years, especially the ones who work behind the cheese, meat, and seafood counters and coffee shop were all very helpful, patient, and eager to give me samples (cheese) or ideas of the best product to use in a particular dish (meat and seafood).  And, to boot, Metcalfe's is clean, well lit, and open 24 hours. Sure, you can rack up a hefty tab shopping here, but with quality comes a price (and, frankly, I did buy my cereal and other staples at Woddman's or other grocery stores--but I got most of my produce, cheese, bread, etc. here). If you're looking for good, fresh local food, this is the place, not those national chain stores. I'd take Metcalfe's over Whole Foods and Trader Joe's any day, hands down."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and would come here more often if it was closer to home. Always a great selection of fresh food. I mainly come here for the seafood. On my last visit they had 25+ different types of fish. Its always fresh with a large variety. It would be great if they had one on the east side of Madison. The meat section and prepackaged meat also has a lot of variety and it all looks great! Check out was quick at the self checkout."}
{"text":"I wanted to thank you for your service of online shopping, and delivery. I am coming to Madison, from Colorado, for Christmas. Rather than spend Christmas Eve shopping, in person, I was able to place my order online, and have the items delivered to my parent's door. Thank you again for your GREAT service! Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"So I tried several grocery stores in Madison (Trader Joes, Copps, Whole Foods, Willy-coop, and Woodman's), and I have to say that Sentry finally captured my heart. I love this place. Ok, WF still has the best bakery section, but Sentry carries way more selections. Lots of produces at good prices, pretty flowers, huge selection of condiments, etc etc. I just like walking around a pretty grocery store. If I had a car, this is definitely my destination for groceries, but until then, I'll save it for special occasions."}
{"text":"I have had an opportunity to visit Metcalfe's Market several times recently. I am always pleased by the atmosphere. They have a good selection and I often find something new to tempt me. I especially like all of the gluten free bakery options. The store to easy to shop and never too busy. My only complaint is that the staff could be friendlier and sometimes I can't find help when I need it. I look forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I'm on a Madison grocery store reviewing rage!   Metcalfe's is pretty much Wisconsin's own version of Whole Foods. It has the same brightly lit displays and wide open layout. I think the prices are comparable as well.  Metcalfe's carries all the local goodies (Potter's crackers, Mad Urban Bees honey, etc.) that Copps and Woodmans don't carry. Some items are a little more expensive than other places, but considering the convenience, I don't mind paying a couple cents extra to pick something up at Metcalfe's.   I was looking to pick up some side dishes for a picnic, and decided to stop by the deli to peruse their prepared dishes. I ended up going with the signature potato salad, which a hit at the picnic! I'd say that Metcalfe's would be the place to stop after work to pick up groceries if you are too lazy or too tired to cook for the night because you could always make a pit-stop by the deli/hot foods/salad bar before exiting!"}
{"text":"I came here for one reason, the free Sunday paper. I love free stuff. Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.  It is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.  Back to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!  There was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.  Sorry Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe (or whomever you are), work on the bakery, let me know and I will come back and re-evaluate you again."}
{"text":"Way back when my grocery bill was sponsored by my parents, this was the place I went for groceries.  The produce was usually the star of my shopping trip.  I like this grocery store, because it has the selection of Whole Foods but also carries Heinz Ketchup and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. (However their selection of perishables and ethnic food does NOT beat Woodmans.)   When I was required to make gift baskets for various people, this is where I would go to get my fancy olives, spreads, and crackers.  Yes it is pricey, and once I get a grocery sponsor again I'd never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Yelp ought to create a new category for places like Metcalfe's Market because the term \"grocery store\" just doesn't do this hip hap justice.   Food Emporium  Grocery Galleria Majestic Market  Call it whatever you want, this place makes AJs (a high end grocer in Arizona where I've been living for the past 6 years) look like ye old five-and-dime. Now I'll be the first to admit I'm barely breaking into the grocery scene here in Madison, and I know there are Co-ops and farmer's markets galore. But what really gets me going about this place is that most every meat, dairy and grain product has a sign with the distance in miles that product traveled to Metcalfe's. WHAT? Eggs from 40 miles away too far for you? Grab a dozen from the farm that's labeled 8 miles away... no yolk! Care to chomp cheese that doesn't drive more than 5? They've got it. Add java, pasta sauce even tortilla chips bagged 1 mile down the street at the local taqueria and you have a geographically conscious way to stock pantry fridge and freezer.   Oh and Chef Lea Caplan... I have no idea who you are, but I want to know who you are. She is Metcalfe's resident food expert, writing books, leading cooking demonstrations and showing up to festivals and fairs to teach Madisonians about how to take home Metcalfe's great local goods and start using them in rad recipes. Add to this the fact that the place is run on 100% green energy (that's like the wind y'all) and their bag program that awards you .10 for every reusable bag you bring in to pack your picks. Don't dig dimes? You can donate that savings to a local charity.   Metcalfe's you're a sign of the times."}
{"text":"Blergh!  I guess when you get uber used to something, it's hard to feel at home anywhere else?   I wanna pop back and give this Metcalfes another try when I'm on that side of town, but it ain't no Hilldale, I'll tell ya that much.   Smaller.  Sparsely staffed.  Colder/darker interio. (Really, they need more lighting up front.)   The gents behind the meat counter were very kind. They had awesome looking flank steaks when I was there which I can't say Metcalfes at Hilldale always has. Bonus.   I think anyone on that side of town would say it's a welcome addition, but that's because they don't know the joy that is Metcalfes Hilldale."}
{"text":"Wow,.  I was in this store years ago when they first Opened and I didn't remember it looking as it does now.  It was an experience and if I shopped here often I could Get in trouble.  It was all a about the presentation and customer service.  I felt like I was in different cultural areas on each turn around the deli, shush, bakery, cheese areas as they were each their own identity with full service.  It was a very enjoyable grocery shopping experience.  Wish I didn't  live an hour away."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons to shop at Metcalf's.  Sure, the price point may be a little bit higher than Copp's, but the produce and meat selection is fantastic.  They have a better cheese selection than the tiny Whole Foods one, too.  The thing that I really like about Metcalf's is that they are dedicated to the Madison community.  They are the sponsor of Brat Fest and are invested in the eat local movement.  It seems like every time I go there they have more signs up showing \"food miles,\" how far the food has traveled to the store.  They also have a beautiful display near the front of the produce area showcasing veggies and fruits from local farms.  There is a huge selection of prepared foods and even an espresso bar.  You can tell that alot of thought and money went into the recent remodel of the store."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, Metcalf's is as close to Marianos as you can get--and if you've been to one, you know that is a complement!  You can pretty much get anything your heart desires here: truffled mousse, fresh sea scallops, an amazing selection of aged beef, tons of awesome pre-made salads and a gorgeous floral cooler that rivals any florist in the city."}
{"text":"In an age of FedEx'ed groceries in a box, Metcalf's is here to remind us that grocery shopping offers inspiration to make something and new ingredients.   I prefer this location over the Hilldale one only because the people here seem exceptionally happy to be working there and they're proactive in asking if customers need help finding something.   Came across the Spotted Cow beer brats in the butcher section by accident and it changed my life. You'll never buy a 6-pack of pre-cooked, packaged brats again. Produce is always fresh and never goes bad prematurely like produce from Whole Foods or Costco often do. Liquor section is a little small but forgivable."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicest markets I have gone to! Its so clean and nicely setup. The interior does remind me of the Whole Foods market and I absolutely fell in love with this market.  Comparing this market to Safeway, I will definitely choose this store anyday! Safeway is pretty known for expensive groceries. Yes, it is clean and near but after visiting Metcalfe's, I have to say this market deserves more recognition from me.  I loved their produce section! Their produce is so fresh and priced just right. They do have a small organic section just like any other markets nowadays. Their meat department is super clean and the guys working there seemed very kind as well.  They have a lot to offer and have many departments to look over. I can see myself coming here everyday if I lived here in Madison, even if I had nothing to purchase just because I love going to grocery stores just to browse around.  Plenty of parking available and cashiers are friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Even when I decided to go with Copps since it was cheaper, I always missed my Metcalfe's. The produce selection is infinitely better when compared with Copps and the service is much better as well. I love to go to all their promotions: Salsa tasting, Tuesday Night Run, Chocolate tasting and more. It is a bit more pricey then other stores, but the service is up there."}
{"text":"I would agree that Metclafe's is best for speciality foods and arrangements that you aren't going to find elsewhere. For me the shining star in this category would have to be their fantastic selection of cheeses. They offer every kind imaginable, prioritizing on showcasing local creameries. Well the prices may seem a little steep in comparison to the day to day connivence of Woodman's, it's well worth it for the premium selection of local and international cheeses."}
{"text":"This place is so fancy.  The prices reflect that.  While I shop for my staples at another location, I know I can find a new flavor or a new product here almost weekly.  They do a fantastic job of promoting sales and have nice specials.  The deli is the best in Madison with so many choices.  They have event nights for sampling new items.  A great email news letter.  The staff is helpful and friendly usually.  It is my neighborhood grocery store so I will buy milk here if I run out but I have to have a real need for it.  One down side, sometimes the pre packaged sliced fruit tastes like veggies.  Like new knifes are not being used for slicing produce.  If you fix that, I could be more interested in that product."}
{"text":"I decided to update this review since I now go to Metcalfes about 2x a week for the last 2 years. Metcalfes is awesome. I don't care if certain items are a little bit more spendy, it's worth it to me to specifically go here instead of Copps.  Staff here puts a little more effort into everything.  For example, when you order at the deli, they will slice a piece for you and ask if you'd like it as a sample.  The meat counter staff will always ask if you need any preparation tips or guidance.  If you need to locate something in the store, they will personally guide you to that item.  And at what other major grocery store do you see Buddha's Hand (citrus type) stocked year round?  Plus it's open 24/7...there's no other place in Madison where you can get good bakery at 4AM (sorry Woodmans, it's true).  Get on their email list even if you're normally not into that sort of thing.  The weekly coupons in the email list are often AWESOME, like any type of butter (including the fancy organic stuff) for free, any frozen pizza free, a pumpkin, a boquet of flowers...never know what the deal is going to be!  I also enjoy their samples and the special events they host, like Battle of the Chocolates (try 50 chocolates and vote on the best one!)"}
{"text":"Lacks the charm of the Hilldale location but also less crowded.    Metcalfe's is well known for their high food standards, customer service, and, as a result, somewhat elevated prices.  The Mineral Point location makes no exception.  Good selection of cheeses, fresh meats, produce, flowers, and imported \"ethnic\" foods.  As a former Cub Foods, this store can feel a little cavernous (high warehouse ceilings) compared to the flagship Hilldale location.  However, the wider aisles make shopping more pleasant during special events-: ne of the events  at this location would have been extremely hard to navigate at Hilldale, but I encountered no problems here.  As always, the prices at Metcalfe's are higher, so stay away from the common durable goods and stick to the perimeter and you'll be good!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest grocery stores I've ever seen. Between a variety of self-service bars and posting how many food miles the items are, this location is definitely ahead of the curve with grocery stores, without charging out the wazoo like Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I love Metcalfe's. I think they have the freshest produce as well as meats and seafood. While they are pricier than Pick 'n Save, I think it's totally worth it. They also aim to sell local products, which is also pretty cool.  What stands out to me about Metcalfe's is the customer service. They're all very nice people working there and are happy to help locate things.  The atmosphere of the store feels welcoming in general."}
{"text":"Metcalf's is a great spot for lunch and dinner entrees to go.  Good prices for quality food.  They have sandwiches, Salads, and fresh sushi.  It's all delicious."}
{"text":"The swankiest grocery store in town that isn't Whole Foods or some sort of co-op.  While pricey, attractive people shop there and they have classical piped over the speakers.  Feels like shopping in some alternate America where everybody is hot and milk is one dollar more expensive."}
{"text":"You may want to consider making Metcalfe's your grocery store of choice. It's not the cheapest grocery store in town, but it's quality justifies their prices. Their wonderful selection of fresh (options for organic and non-organic fruits, veggies, and products are appreciated!) and prepared food is excellent and they carry a great variety of \"general\" grocery items (sorry Whole Foods, sometimes I just want unhealthy chips and soda). Their floral department is wonderful (and came through in a pinch on Mother's Day!) and their bakery is one of the best within a grocery in town. Free parking is appreciated as well and its location is great as it's also attached to the recently remodeled Hildale mall. The feel of the store is clean and welcoming. All employees are knowledgable, friendly and extremely good at their jobs -- this is another reason to shop here - to support their inclusive hiring policy. I applaud Metcalfe's specifically for that as well."}
