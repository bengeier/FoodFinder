{"text":"I brought my girlfriend from out of town here and we loved it! Our new favorite little spot in old town! Estella and Joe are pretty entertaining. Totally makes the experience all worthwhile. Beers good too!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best tap rooms in AZ      Their saison is the fresh tasting and the Desert Kettle board is so yummy. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon and enjoyed one of their pints and sampled a few others.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Their beer is great and they offer selection from other breweries.  Being a beer snob from Milwaukee, I give this place two thumbs up and would return."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a whim on a quiet Saturday afternoon, and had an excellent experience. It's a small space but inviting, clean and bright, and would be a fun spot to bring friends and play games in the evening. The gal that served our beer flights was knowledgeable and great to talk with. $5 got us three tastes of Bad Water's beers- the Saison was perfect for a warm day. If the salted caramel collaboration with North Mountain is still there, try it too!"}
{"text":"Great small brew pub! Staff was very friendly, atmosphere is great and the beer was good! Will definitely be returning many times to this new spot!"}
{"text":"Great place in Old Town Scottsdale. Beer selection is pretty solid. I really enjoyed Bad Water's IPA, mild taste without being overboard with hops. We also had the Brewer's Reserve cheese &  meat board which was a nice blend. Cool atmosphere and awesome service."}
{"text":"I kind of don't want to say anything publicly about how awesome this place is because I love the chill vibe, but Bad Water is so great that I feel compelled. If I could have designed a chill pub it would be this place.  Just off the beaten path, its clean lines, cozy atmosphere, friendly bar staff, and all around good vibes are a welcome respite from the club-centric neighborhood just a couple of blocks north.  The beer selection was small but well curated, and their IPA was stellar.  

The paninis, oh the paninis. Grilled cheese, all the way, so gooey and delicious. Watching the bartender create layer after layer of cheesey goodness warmed my soul.  (Go cheese!) I also appreciate that they have vegetarian/vegan friendly charcuterie options. 

The beer. Their IPA was delicious and crisp, and I sampled the porter they had on draft - also delicious. If you hate beer, this might not be the place for you, but I'm excited to see what their seasonal selections will shift to as we get closer toward fall.

The vibe. Solid 25yo+ yupsters - so exactly my type of people! Fellow patrons were relaxed and enjoying themselves, the playlist was a perfect trip down memory lane, and their were board games galore. I kind of want to live here. 

Bad Water is fantastic. Go. Go right now.  Ok, wait until they open, but go soon!"}
{"text":"Good beer, good customer service and nice hidden location away from all the clubs! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and were so glad we did. Great food, beer and service. I had the Prohabition Stockpile platter and my husband had the 911 panini. Both were made of quality ingredients and prepared with attention to detail. If we lived in Scottsdale, this would definitely be a frequent stop."}
{"text":"Was in town for a brief Sun break in the midst of Seattle's rainy season and saw this place was new so decided to check it out. My wife and I were the only ones in the place, but the lovely owners made us feel at home. Being surrounded by great breweries in Seattle, we have a high standard for beer, but this place is solid and has a unique take on their styles. The lager is especially malty for a lager and full bodied, while the IPA is less bitter band lower alcohol than most. The saison is the star, with a nice balance and spicy, yeasty, and banana undertones. If you're around, give them a try."}
{"text":"I heard about Bad Water Brewing from a friend, thought I would give it a chance, and have been coming back ever since.  It's the prefect place to unwind after a long day at work, or to start a night out. 

They have an astounding selection of beers, including three of their own; an IPA, lager, and saison. I have enjoyed all three, but my personal favorite is the IPA. It has the hoppiness we all expect with an IPA, but with a crisp finish providing an easy drink. Plus with a 5.0% ABV, you can have more than two and not be falling off your bar stool. 

The atomosphere is very calm and settling anywhere you sit. For those interested in sports they have two tv's easily viewable from any bar seat, plus a third in a private room available upon request. If you prefer a more intimate setting for a date night, or meeting, sitting at one the tables is perfect. 

Lastly,  the music selection really blew me away. I heard everything from Adelle to the Rolling Stones, but everything flowed together at a volume where you could hear the lyrics, without having to shout to the person next to you.  

I would recommend this place to everybody and anybody!"}
{"text":"I love how cozy this spot was.  There is a such thing as being too big and BWB hit the nail on the head in terms of size.  It's so intimate. easy to talk to the person sitting next to you, if thats what you so desire.  Or you can immerse yourself in your own conversation.  The bar staff here was amazing for this event and worked so hard to make sure everyone was taken care of.  We loved the beer flights.  Even I am not a fan of IPA's but the IPA they served in the beer flight wasn't too bad, sure it had the bitterness at the end but a lot easier to drink than most IPA's.  My favorite had to be the Saison beer, it had just enough sweet notes to captivate me.  I do want to talk about my favorite thing though, which was our charcuterie board.  We had the brewer's reserve which I think was a perfect combination of meat and cheese.  The fig spread was amazing but I am also a sucker for fig anything  I do wish they had given a little more of the fig, as not all the beer:meat:fig ratios were balanced and thats kind of a huge pet peeve of mine.  Regrettably I didnt find where the pistachios or almonds fit in with that board but that is just my opinion.  Overall this would be a spot I would definitely come back to again.  I forgot to ask if they serve any kidn of wine but even if they dont, they have a couple beers that I, pickiest of all beer drinkers, enjoy."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I went here while in town on business. We were looking for something local that wouldn't be too much food.  We loved this place.  The hostess/bartender/sandwich maker/cheese plater was super nice and patient explaining the different boards and sandwiches and making switches to accommodate allergies.  We'd have given five stars if they weren't out of fig preserves. Even if you're not a beer drinker, you have to stop in for the tasty charcuterie plates and paninis. They're all great and perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Horrrrible service the waitress picked our beer for our beer flights, and I asked for a glass of water three times when there was only about 6 people in the whole bar.  The beer was good but not the choice I'd pick."}
{"text":"We found a deal on Groupon for Bad Water Brewing so my boyfriend & I have gone in for a quiet night out in Scottsdale. The groupon offer was for 2 beer flights & a charcuterie board which we enjoyed while playing Battleship & other games!

By far one of my favorite things about Bad Water is that it's very small & homey but there are some activities to do such as play board games or throw some darts at the dart board ... a little friendly competition!

As far as the charcuterie boards go, we've tried a few different ones. We've gotten the Desert Kettle board which I call the \"jerky board\" since it comes with 3 different types of jerky, some cheeses, a really yummy jam, and lavash. The Salud board is a mix of meats and cheeses which we liked as well. Also, the Noble Stave is also really good especially if you're not a fan of meats as it has a few different types of cheeses. I've heard this from many different people that the Blueberry Goat Cheese is their favorite and it's by far one of my favorites as well!

The beer that they have is good too. My boyfriends favorite is the saison. While i'm not a beer connoisseur, I enjoy getting the beer flight so I get a variety & have something to sip on.

The service is a little bit off sometimes, but overall, they do a good job. I'd definitely recommend this place for a date night or even with a group! The Groupon is an AMAZING deal so check that out before you go."}
{"text":"I am mostly neutral on this place.  It is a nice place, friendly staff, and nice limited food menu.  However, their beer is made offsite, and shipped in...They do not make it locally, and I believe they have it made via 3rd party contract.  Their branded beer is ok, not a fan of their IPA, not hoppy enough for me.  They did have a nice selection of guest beers.

Overall-just know what you have here.  Its not what I would call a micro or nano, but a nice place that serves craft beer."}
{"text":"Great location, and tasty beer! The ambiance of this place is great down to the detail of the menus. The staff was friendly and were helpful in explaining all of the beer as well as the food options. I would recommend one of the delivcious boards offered or the panini's which are very filling.

Come out with family and friends, as they have a seperate breakout room for darts, hosting a get together. The place is spotless, and the bathrooms are a short walk away and stay clean as well from my visits there. Be sure to listen for the music that is played throughout the brewery as well, as they keep the music playing all night long.

Overall I would recommend this to the college student looking to grab a brew, to a couple looking for a nice night out and want to relax over food and some beer. As mentioned it is located in old town, so be sure to stop by for lunch, dinner, or happy hour and experience a great brewery."}
{"text":"First time here as part of the Synek Kickstarter pickup.  

Had a nice conversation with one of the owners. Recommend to try the Desert Kettle Charcuterie to eat.  WOW! It was amazing. The flavors paired well with their Saison and IPA.

Their menu was great in it told you the ABV and IBU.  Nice way to help determine what you want to drink.  I loved the IPA as not over powering with hops.

I'd say this place is on the must visit list"}
{"text":"Came to Badwater brewing with my fiancee on July 4th weekend. On saturday to be exact.  Walked from goldwater to Badwater in the sweltering heat. Just the thought of having a cold craft beer was in my thoughts as we turned the corner. 

Badwater is on a street with small shops around. It was a little bit hard to locate. As GPS said \"you have arrived\" I saw the Badwater sign up on the building. Windows were tinted and looked closed. I was bummed. We walked to the door and gave it a tug.. ahhhhhhh... they were opened!. Upon entrance looked to my right.. there was a glass case with memorabilia and shirts and stuff. To the left.. chairs and tables. And directly in front. A long bar. 

We were immediately greeted by the their female bartender. Super nice. We had great conversation. She gave us the break down on their beers. 

IPA - on tap. Well balanced. Not too hoppy but pretty refreshing. 

Saison - bottled. I think their Saison was the best out of the 3 that Badwater had. 

Lager- on the thick side and matly. I'm ok with thick malty beers but the Saison was the better of the 3 in my opinion. 

They also sell 6 packs of different types of beers. You're able to put together a 6 pack for a few bucks. As we stayed at Hyatt place- Badwater was literally 162 steps away. 

Badwater has really good things going on. Would come back when we come back to scottsdale."}
{"text":"They have no kitchen, but they still manage to charge between $15 and $17 for those fancy boards with some cheese, etc. Not a great concept. On my quick visit the bartenders nearly outnumbered the guests. They have a few TV sets, but would not classify this a place as anything more than a place to get a beer if your a guest at one of the local hotels. Had a lager, but they tasted better out of the can which is the way they were served at the Yelp event. More of an elitist bar with a non-elitist beer selection.  KInd of skinny place too, but still might be useful for a couple, but not the real drinkers of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pleasant, modest, modern stylings. They carry their own line and a few others on tap and bottles. I've never seen it very crowded but was usually able to strike up a conversation with Lauren or Joe, who are fun and engaging. Two large TVs behind the bar and they were always good about taking suggestions. Not much in the way of food offerings, but definitely went there a number of times after dinner when we were looking for a place to drink and relax."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Saturday night. We were the only people there. The music was great! 
The saison is delicious. 

The bartender is fun and played a few rounds of uno with us. 

They have a bunch of board games you can play while you are there."}
{"text":"I always try to sample some local breweries when I travel, so I was happy to discover that Bad Water was just around the corner from my hotel. The tap room is small but very nice and comfortable. The service both times I went was outstanding - very friendly and helpful. I didn't have time to try the food, but the Western Lager is a top notch beer. Definitely one of my all-time favorites. I even brought a six-pack back in my suitcase because it's so unique. The saison is also very good, though I'm generally not a big saison fan in the first place. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I'll definitely be back for more of that Western Lager. Hopefully I'll have more time to hang out and try their food too, because it's a great little tap room."}
{"text":"Mr. M and I hit this place yesterday because we had a Groupon for a charcuterie board and 2 beer flights.  It's tucked back behind the Marriott (good to know) and was totally quiet when we walked in around noon.  People must have been out standing in the return/exchange lines or shopping.  Right away I liked the design of the place.  They have some excellent iron work with the sign over the passageway, and on the bar stools.  Love that.  The interior is very comfortable and stylish.  Nicely done.  

We didn't get the bartender's name, but she was great.  She explained the available beers and we talked about the charcuterie boards and decided to order the Prohibition Stockpile board and the turkey and fig panini to share.  Everything was really nice and we ended up enjoying a leisurely lunch.  The quality of the meats on the board was outstanding and we got to try a few things we've never had before like caper berries and mostarda di fruta made with a pear.  Really excellent and paired nicely with the beers.  

The panini was filled with good quality ingredients and I loved that the bread was fresh and light.  So many places use large, dense bread that kind of overwhelms the sandwich and is also way too filling.  Their panini was perfect.  I would definitely order food there again.

The beers were nice.  That's the best way I can describe them.  Very mild, complex flavors and nothing with a knock-you-on-your-butt ABV which I appreciate.  Thank you thank you thank you for brewing an IPA that doesn't have such a bitter & dry finish that I feel like my tongue has been stripped.  The IPA is excellent and so is the saison.  The lager may become our new hanging out by the pool beer.  We brought a 6-pack of that home.  

They also have a very nice Abita Pecan brew on tap right now.  That one made me wish I had a growler with me.  Overall an excellent experience for us.  Some people may like their beers with a lot more aggressive flavors, and they may not like Bad Water as much as we did, but it's still a great experience and a priority for us to support our local brewers.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for 2 beer flights and a charcuterie board. I'm not a beer person, but my BF is. He seemed to really enjoy all of his beers and was able to discuss them with our waitress who was seemed very knowledgeable. 

The interior is simple and nice. My only complaint would be that none of the chairs have backrests, even at the tables. So I can't recommend this place to anyone with back issues. There are a ton of board and card games to amuse yourself with, as well as a dart board. 

The cheese platter was nice and had some original components. For example, I really enjoyed the sweet wasabi-like jelly. I've never had anything like it before."}
{"text":"This place is so cool!! The bar has a great atmosphere. Comfy chairs and a spacious bar. Good beers on tap and pretty good choices for wine as well. They also have games to keep you entertained!!! Love coming here. Bartenders are awesome and keep the beer flowing!!"}
{"text":"What a secretly tucked away gem in Scottsdale. It was my first time in tonight and it went very well. To start, the beer was phenomenal. Joe and Louis were helping us and they were awesome, even with all of our questions. I picked the IPA for my pint, and my plus one, he ordered the lager. For the charcuterie board, we got the \"noble stave\" and the standouts to me were for sure he blueberry goat cheese and the gorgonzola. Will definitely be back in."}
{"text":"I was confused by this place. I was expecting to see more than two beers from this brewery on tap. I came to this place because I like checking out new breweries, especially since I am from out of town. If I wanted an Oskar Blues or an O'Dell's I would go to another area bar. They had a Saison and Lager on tap that they brewed themselves. The rest of the taps were guest taps. Ill say this though: the Saison was delicious! I really expected more from this place. More than two of their own beers is not too much to ask. If you were thinking of checking this place out, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fun place to meet up with some friends for some beers and shareable snacks. The wait staff was great; quick and friendly. Prices are very good, especially considering this place is in Scottsdale. I'd go back again if in the area."}
{"text":"I loved this little brewery! The staff was very knowledgeable about beer and very friendly. The food was awesome! We got the desert kettle board and loved it. My husband got the IPA and really enjoyed it. I got the lager which was very carbonated but good. Over all we had a really great time!"}
{"text":"Super cute hidden gem!!! Estella and Joe are just as awesome as the beer they serve:) Girls bathroom is cute and provides emergency basket full of goodies:) girls you know what I mean right? Everyone go support local brewery"}
{"text":"I love the idea of being able to enjoy unique tasting beer in an environment outside of the bar-scene.  The food isn't too filling but just enough to hold you over until dinner.  Enjoy an intimate date night or conversation with friends. Either way it's perfectly located in Old Town and the craft beer is amazing!"}
{"text":"Very happy to find this spot in old town. I've walked by it a million times but today I decided to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised to find some solid happy hour specials. The beer was excellent and the cheese plate was fantastic."}
{"text":"There's a new bar with a speakeasy feel in Old Town Scottsdale.

Walk along Brown Avenue and peek in the salon-filled street to find Bad Water Brewing, a bar that balances its craft beers with fancy charcuterie boards and sleek, masculine furnishings that are part upscale sports bar, part minimalist hangout for those simply looking for a tasty brewskie.

The spot serves three craft beers, only distributed in Arizona: a lighter-than-usual IPA; a strong in alcohol, light-in-taste saison; and a caramely Western lager that was probably my favorite of the three (all $5 each). IPAs usually scare me because of their strong taste, though I'm attracted to the high alcohol content, so it's great this fruit-forward IPA went down smoothly and still hit the spot at 5.5 percent alcohol. The saison, with an orange spice tinge, had a whopping 6 percent alcohol percentage, while the lager with a smooth finish had 5 percent. I was impressed with all these local brews, and our knowledgeable server did a great job at explaining the nuances.

We ordered a vegetarian Noble Stave charcuterie board (there's also a vegan one, sans meats and cheeses), normally $15. It came with a scrumptious blueberry goat cheese, brie, gorgonzola, pistachios, almonds, olives, peppers, artichokes and more. It was definitely artfully presented and included some fancy cheeses, but I was disappointed there were only three flat lavash crackers. It came with three long, hard grissini crackers that were difficult to spread anything on, and overall, the offerings were a little sparser than I'd expect for the price.

My favorite part of the board was definitely the blueberry goat cheese. I've never had anything like it and would have enjoyed an appetizer featuring just that. The ingredients all went well together, though I would have loved more lavash.

As for atmosphere, the vibe was relaxed and would make for a great spot for industry folk looking to unwind after working in the area.  I just wish there were some purse hooks on the high-tops, since there was nowhere to put mine except for on my lap, on the floor or on the table.

I wouldn't say I would go there just for the appetizers, but the cheap-in-price, high-in-quality local brews are attractive, and it's nice to have the charcuterie boards (six to choose from, starting at $11), to whet your palate before heading to dinner.

The spot features a 16-seater private room that will be used for educational beer events and that can be reserved for parties, a cool aspect to the venue.

The thing I enjoyed most about Bad Water was its unique beer selection, also including seven drafts and 10 bottled beers from guest breweries, including a favorite of mine, the Lumberyard Pale Ale from Lumberyard Brewing Company in Flagstaff ($6.)"}
{"text":"Cool little place tucked away in Old Town.  Didn't like their IPA because it had barely any hops bitterness.  The lager was just OK.  They are known for their saison and I thought it was their best beer."}
{"text":"Fantastic tucked away gem in Downtown Scottsdale. It has a great speakeasy vibe to it.  I have all their beers on tap and all of them are good. Just make your way through them. Great boards and the inside is done very well. The bartender was super friendly and helpful. This is a great place to chill and have a few brews."}
{"text":"It was a great place to hang, chat, and they have GAMES!  I got the grill cheese panini.  It was great and cheesy!  The server was great in explaining all the differences in the food, apps, etc.  Too bad the dessert selection didn't call my name to stay."}
{"text":"Went on opening night and was impressed to find a real craft brewery as they are hard to find in Arizona as compared to other parts of the country.   This is a tap room so aside from a few gourmet cheese plates there is no food.  Yes, they only have three of their own beers right now but it is for a good reason as they would rather have quality beers over mass production.  Sounds like they have more beers in the works.  In addition to their brews they have another ten or so beers available from other craft/local breweries so there is ample options regardless of what you enjoy drinking.  I had the IPA and while lighter than many IPA's it was easy drinking and good for hot days when you want something more than a pale ale or lighter beer.  There are a few TV's to catch a game and also a semi-private room if you have a group.  Location is good just a couple of blocks off Scottsdale road and there is plenty of parking right out front.  Defiantly worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nice new place. We were treated well. Lots of super strong beers to knock you on your A--. We had a couple and had to slow down because they were super strong. Can't even remember which beer. But the vibe was good, they have a lot of pub boards to choose from. So you don't get too tanked from the strong beers...."}
{"text":"Bad Water is a very small brewery; the definition of nanobrewing, especially compared to many other large Arizona craft breweries. As a company, they produce 3 of their own beers and have about a 6 or 8 other local brews on draft. The taproom itself is a very nice looking place. The building and interior locals very modern and quiet in place with Scottsdale; I really like the look of this place. 

The 3 beers they have are the IPA, Saison & Wesern Lager. The Lager i was not too impressed by; it's maltier then expected, much like a Marzen. The IPA is not very hoppy but flavorful, reminds me of Deschutes Mirror Pond. The Saison is in my opinion their best and is bottled and avaible outside the taproom, so try it out. They are not a full restaurant but they do serve these very unique meat and cheese platters that one must try if you're there! 

Overall, this is a great place to stop by between lunch and dinner for a small plate and beers while in the heart of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really nice tasting room, with a beautiful bar.  They don't brew on site.  Beers was okay, but nothing too special yet.  Although certainly a fun space to have a beer.  The lady serving us was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Their Saison is legit. The best part of this place is that the sleeveless flat billed hat DBs seem to be avoiding this brewery. The only drawback on the day that I went to sample the suds was the Arkansas guy that kept singing \"God Bless America\" at the top of his lungs. To this point, please don't come here if it is your first beer."}
{"text":"Bad Water Brewing! A relatively fun place located in Old Town Scottsdale. I found this place when I was looking around to surprise my Girlfriend for her Birthday, and she sure was surprised. Its a small Bar that is perfect for a great beer and a few hours to kick around and enjoy great conversation. I have been here a few times now. The merchandise they sell is pretty great too, I would recommend this place to everyone who is wanting a fun place to pregame or even go to after the crazy night life. Cozy, Fun, & the staff make this place what is it! Everyone should try this place out, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Small little brewery tap room with 3 of theirs brews on Tap, all of their beers are delicious and flavorful. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Great little hidden gem to grab a beer(or a few beers) and a snack. Number of different cheese\meat plates. The merch is also great priced and lots of variety. 

I would recommend checking it out. Best brewery in old town!"}
{"text":"A nice little place now, but growing. They have been open about 6-7 months, but today was the only the second weekend that they were open for lunch. They have three Bad Water beers: IPA (draft), Saison (bottle), and Lager (bottle). But estimation is the saison will be on draft next week and the lager soon to follow. I had the saison and it was really good. The IPA was a bit lighter in color than I expected, but it tasted good. It was a quiet place today because not many know about lunch, but I imagine evenings and weekends it will be busy. There are only a small number of seats, so get there earl."}
{"text":"Confused about this place. A brewery but have 2 of their own on tap. Random assortment of other beers. But also serve chartruterie plates? I don't get it."}
{"text":"Since this Bar has opened I have gone every time I am down in Phoenix. I like this place as it is set up more like a tasting bar with a classy but not arrogant touch. My biggest criticism is that it is off the beaten path, but that is not always a bad thing. In terms of finding, you almost have to know about it by word of mouth. However, it is in old town which is brutal for parking yet this area, you will find a spot and really not that far of a walk from the main parts of old town. This area has potential as there are talks of more bars going up and I believe the owner was smart to start up in an up and coming area.

As for the beer. I am a great fan of the Western lager. It is a darker yet very smooth ale and I hope it comes up to Canada one. I'm not an IPA or Delirium Fan but his IPA an Saigon, I always continue to hear positive feedback from those into those types of beers. And for the food, it's still limited but they make a great Charcuterie Board, many different selections. So this is great for a small corporate event as they have their backroom, which is well set up or if you are just hanging out with good friends, definitely come here.

You can't go wrong with the service as the owner makes a personal effort to interact with his patrons and values them. For example I was in for super bowl and when so many parties where $1000 and beyond just to enter his party was $16 which included a gift, some food and 20 different samples of beer (the equivalent of a 6 pack). He ended up getting more people than he initially intended and refused to turn them away unlike the other places.

So overall, if you are in Phoenix, definitely do yourself a favor and try this bar out if  you are looking for a good hang out, with great service!"}
{"text":"A gem.  My wife and I stopped at BWB for a drink before dinner on a date night.  Staff was excellent, beer was perfect.  First time we had ever tried the beer BWB beers.  We have already been to Total Wine to pick up more Saison."}
{"text":"Probably the worst tasting beer in Arizona.  Bad Water is an appropriate name for this place since their beer is obviously brewed with bad water.  The guest beers are just mediocre probably because any really good beer would shine the light on how bad their beer is.   Located in Old Town Scottsdale so instead of going to this place spend your money going to any of the dozens of nearby places that have good beer and food. They have a number of charcuterie boards to eat, all overpriced."}
{"text":"Only two beers on tap of theirs and a lager in a bottle ...several guest taps and rotating seasonal  but would like to see them do more of there own. I tried the saison and the ipa...avg"}
{"text":"Great little craft brewery.  Very clean and friendly atmosphere. If your looking for a nice little afternoon break from the heat, stop in here.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable and super friendly.  Great selection of craft beers on tap.  If your looking for a loud bar type place, this is not it.  Very classy and well decorated."}
{"text":"Loved the craft beer selection and the charcuterie at Bad Water Brewery. I had the house brewed Saison and my husband had their IPA. Both were great.

We started with the charcuterie plate and then ended up splitting the 911 panini. Both were made with artisan meats and cheeses. The charcuterie also had really nice olives, fig jam and lavosh crackers. I'll definitely be back!

It's a smaller place in old town Scottsdale that is a little hard to spot. I enjoyed the laid back but modern ambiance."}
{"text":"LOVED Bad Water, but they have unfortunately sold the business and are no longer open"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love trying different breweries in the area. I saw this one one Yelp and figured we should give it a shot.

The location is kind of nice - it's in Old Town, but not on the main drag and parking is still accessible and isn't too crazy if you're just wanting a casual beer. 

We came here before grabbing dinner in Old Town at about 7:30 on a Saturday night. The place was not too busy, but we didn't feel strange or out of place walking in there at all. The bartender was extremely friendly and I believe he had some friends of his visiting and having a few beers. They were all really nice and I sure do wish I remembered his name, as he was very helpful.

The beer selection was very standard - a saison, an IPA, and a lager. My boyfriend and I each got a sampler and we were pleased with all of the beer. Both of us liked the IPA the best, but we both tend to gravitate towards hoppier beer.

Most of the time, I will rate a brewery based on beer alone. However, this place had a pretty laid back atmosphere and lots of board games that upped my rating overall. We had too much fun playing a Saved By the Bell board game from the 80's trying to be the \"most popular girl in school\". Trying to learn an overly complicated board game, drinking good beer, and a friendly environment made for a great start to our night.

We would definitely be back! My one suggestion would be for more of a Bad Water beer selection in the future. Good start with three solid beers for now! :)"}
{"text":"First time here, but the service was great.

DELISH Salud Board (Calabrese Sopersatta, Breasola, Argentina Cacciatore Salami, Blueberry Goat Cheese, Gorgonzola Dolce, Boschettodi Tartufo, Spanish Artichokes, Mostardadi Fruta, Golden & Red Pappadew Peppers, Grissini, Lavash)

Boarded a delightful flight with a Lager, Saison and IPA that put my tastebuds in a frenzy! Atmosphere was inviting and the dart board was a PLUS!

Ready to go back again soon!"}

 My coworkers and I stumbled across this hidden gem several weeks ago and It's quickly become my go to watering hole when by no fault of my own, I'm in old town Scottsdale.  It's a couple blocks off the beaten path and is nestled unexpectedly on a side street several blocks from the typical cluster mucks of Dbag/Sorrostutute bars focused on fire ball and fist pumping. 
  
 
The Bad Water Brewing tap room is a welcome oasis from the WWDB (World War DBag) outbreak that has plagued old town since the invention of the graphic T-shirt.  The interior is well lit and enjoys a really nice energy that's difficult to describe--5 star hotel bar meets modern day John Wayne. 
 
 
They have a rotating tap of 8-12 local craft beers and maybe an additional 30 available by bottle.  If an IPA and a Hefferveisen were equal parts in an arranged marriage--their first child would be bad water saison. Full bodied with a refreshing finish.  Currently my favorite craft beer that's come out of Arizona. That said, my fiancé doesn't drink beer but swears by the hard ciders and has now spent enough money on charcuterie to warrant ( in this author's mind ) the pawning of her engagement ring.
 
The staff is attentive, welcoming and artful at explaining the stories behind the respective craft breweries--the bearded bar keep Joe was good enough to explain the difference between farmhouse ales, lagers and IPAs to my colleagues and various guests.  I'm still figuring out who's who behind the bar but know that a local family owns and operates the place and have all been gracious and patient with ordering decisions and table turnover.  

I Highly recommend getting to know the brewmaster who has more stories and historical anecdotes about brewing than one knew existed.  He's happily kept the place open past closing for my guests and I on more than one occasion.  
 
Cheers, l'heim, Salud and Prost.  I tip my hat and to Bad Water Brewing I owe a toast...."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm just the neighsayer of the group here but I've got to think as a brewery in Phoenix we can all do MUCH better. Lets start with the name...why on Earth would you name your brewery Bad Water - beer is mostly water and I certainly don't want to think about anything bad to do with my beer's ingredients. 

Next thing, there are 3 beers offered here and of the three, well actually no, they're all really REALLY terrible. There's an IPA, and I love IPAS, but this one is lacking in hops, nose, flavor so basically a poor man's hopped water. The saison is equally bad with an overly alcohol forward, almost acetone-like flavor which overpowers the nice belgian yeast you're looking for in this style and then the lager. Well, that's the best one and I don't even like lagers as a style but it's the least offensive beer they have. 

Sure there are guest taps (Uncle Bear's, Angry Orchard, maybe an Oak Creek Hefe), but there are much better beer bars in the area - Craft 64 to name one standout. Also, there are some nice tables and decent cheese boards to enjoy here. So if you don't like beer, you might like it here? Honestly though, its a brewery and they are doing a disservice to the awesome AZ beer scene by calling themselves that. Go to Goldwater or Two Brothers, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Bad Water is a semi-hidden gym. Fans of craft beer seem to know about it, but it also seems to slide in under the radar such that it was nice and empty on a Saturday night with a playoff football game (just two parties of 4 while we were there). We came her on a groupon deal, and the bartender went above and beyond with recommendations, samples, and personalizing both our drink and food choices. I love their charcuterie/pub boards as they are the perfect pairing with a nice drink, and again, were personalized to our liking (even added cheese to a non-cheese board so that both my honey and I could be happy). This place is one worth stopping by and spending a bit of time; settle in, pick out a game from the pile (or darts on the wall), and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to get some craft beers in Old Town Scottsdale across the way from all of the other bars. So not too crazy busy. They do a nice variety of different cheese and meat boards as well as six or so and paninis. The location had a nice vibe to it in the salon district"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great beers on tap both their own and other craft breweries. They have games to sit and play if you'd like.  The food is also incredibly awesome!!! Me and a friend split a board (I can't remember which now since they all looked  phenomenal) and 2 different paninis the Italian (my personal favorite because of all the meats) and the Turkey and Fig which is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, they also come with chips! It's a little bit hidden but completely a gem and I have no doubt we'll be going again and again!"}
{"text":"Great food, killer beer.  The hubbie is a big beer fan, but I'm usually more of a wine drinker.  Bad Water Brewing has a great selection of beer, though, and I actually enjoyed every one I tried, ranging from the Sour Cider to the Season to some sort of beer which I'm pretty sure was blended with honey (awesome aftertaste).  We split the Salud platter, which had a tasty selection of spicy meats and sweet cheeses.  I love the fancy platters here - splitting one of those is a perfect light meal to go with a beer sampler.

Great vibe as well, with friendly staff who will pause to chat with you.  Definitely will be on my list of places to bring company and grab a drink when friends come to visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had ta Groupon that included a beer flight and a charcuterie board. The beers are okay. Not memorable. Saison was the best. It had a little more body than the the others. All were very light. The Salud board was good but again not impressive. The poor girl that was working was trying hard to keep everyone happy but the flow could have been better if there were at least one other person working."}
