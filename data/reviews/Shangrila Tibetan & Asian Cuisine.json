{"text":"One of my best restaurant with the taste of nepali food.i just love being there again and again.you will get very good customer service.i highly recommend 
This restaurant"}
{"text":"Really quite good.  What a very nice surprise, and it was a 5 minute walk from where we were staying.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was outstanding.  We went on a Tuesday and it was very quiet.
Will go again during our stay."}
{"text":"Nice food and fast service. Gotta try the tofu Manchurian and noodles. Tibetan tea and Indian railroad tea are great to try too. Must try, will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great food! Interior is pretty authentic too. Has a cool feel. 
I wouldn't suggest going on a weekend night because it gets quite busy!

Recommendations:
Crispy beef, chili chicken, veggie deluxe, momos for apps & the tripe for apps is AMAZING."}
{"text":"The decor is low key and comforting. The food is simply amazing. The weekend specials are perfect. Why have Tibetian anywhere else in the city?"}
{"text":"Just love this place! The ambience, food and of course the hosts. The trademark momos (I go for pork mostly) are delicious and you can't go wrong with the pork chilly. Crispy beef is another item you don't wanna miss on the menu. And the chow mein, and noodle soup, and everything else on the menu :)

Lately they started serving Steam Whistle on the tap, so yay! You can catch hockey on the big screen while lounging on the floor - I prefer this seating over the chairs, although you might want to come in a group of 4 for that.

The hosts are friendly and honest, which is always a good thing. Highly recommended and I personally come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Superb service and delicious food, what more can we expect from a restaurant, and the price is great!"}
{"text":"went for dinner mid week and the restaurant was fairly empty. so it's a great place to have dinner and chat with friends. 

we ordered 
fish chili - best of the night. 5 stars!
chicken manchurian - meh. not a fan, but you might be
pork momo's - yum! great portions and flavour
house fried noodles - a bit greasy.

I would come back for the chili dishes, momos, and skip the fried noodles."}
{"text":"First time to Shangrila under a recommendation just yesterday and were very happy with our picks - crispy beef ($6.99), crispy cauliflower ($5.99), pork Shangrila noodles ($7.99), and beef momo at $7.99 (large dumplings, deep fried with delicious meat filling)..

We were the first ones in at 6pm on Sunday night, so service was great.  The dishes all came within 20 minutes (momo last), and had great spice.  Just enough to seem naturally part of the dish.

The cauliflower was a big reco - which was amazing, but I'll try some others before going right back to them.  They were deepfried, and mixed with buttery onions, cilantro, and green chilis.  The beef was crispy and had a great mouth feel - dry slices, crispy, with a good chew - very different from some northern Chinese dishes where the beef is ultra tender with a crispy outside.  They were fantastic!

Portions were excellent - we ate a lot, and were able to take enough food home for two.

Will return (but not after trying the other Tibetan places in the area) - although this one seems to be getting a lot of the attention."}
{"text":"We go to Shangrila often and we are never disappointed.  The menu has a good selection and the prices are right!  The atmosphere is not fancy and the lighting is a bit cold, but you can't beat the value.  And the servers/owners are incredibly friendly.  Try the steamed buns and tofu chili, one of our faves!  Many of the noodle dishes also come with house-made noodles."}
{"text":"My GF and I had been thinking about trying one of the Tibetan spots along Queen West for a while and finally got out there the other week. Had a few ideas of where to go and Shangrila seemed to have the best reviews so we went for it. RIght off the top what sticks out is the value is outstanding, not to mention the food. The staff were extremely friendly and we've never been so we pretty much let our server order for us. I really don't care for cauliflower but that app is really good. We had two mains, veg momos and a kind of curry beef w noodles main with rice. We each had a drink and the damage came to a whopping $35! Now that it's getting warm I think we'll be biking there a couple times a month as we've been looking for somewhere like this where the food is great and the price is right."}
{"text":"Excellent momos, nice burst of broth when biting into the steamed ones. The hot sauce is intriguing. Kind of a menthol/camphor element to it, along with the fenugreek, chilli flavour. 

As a matter of taste, the chilli garlic noodles were not at all what I was expecting. They were brilliant red (the shade of this yelp app) as if they'd been cooked Classic Chinese food sweet and sour sauce. Tasty, in their own way, but not what I was expecting. Same with the crispy beef. Candied in the same bright red sauce. It's delicious, but super sweet and I hate to ask how they produced that colour red.

Great place to go with friends for a feast. Very friendly and nice environment. There are lots of other Tibetan restaurants to try in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


Shangrila is a lovely place to try for a solid Asian meal. Especially if you're a vegetarian, you'll find a wide selection of choices.
Flavourful soups, well-cooked dumplings, and a pleasant casual atmosphere. There's even a little shrine if you want to spend some time with Buddha.
I was impressed with the laid back, yet professional and prompt service. This is my kind of place.

4 stars"}
{"text":"Was a bit odd going into this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. There weren't many customers at the time but the good reviews had us intrigued. The food was excellent. Had the special of the day which included unlimited lentil soup. Mutton was well cooked and flavourful, same with the veggies. They give you way too much rice but oh well. Only complaint I would say was that they were blaring a basketball game over the speakers the whole time. This was strange given the type of restaurant. Other than that it was a good experience. Good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city. The food is consistently good, the prices are very reasonable, friendly service, and a lovely atmosphere. My favourite dish is the Paneer Manchurian, with spicy crispy beef, shangrila noodles, and of course crispy cauliflower as my other go-tos. Momos are my new favourite type of dumpling - I don't think I've ever been and NOT ordered some steamed veggie momos. Add some of their delicious house-made hot sauce to everything but be careful, it is very spicy.

We come here often and I'm so glad to see it's getting busier and more popular - they deserve it. If I ever move out of the neighbourhood Shangrila will be what brings me back at least twice a month!"}
{"text":"A great spot. I love the chili fish here, it's really good (not very hot but savory). The beef momos are also done very well - fried are always a fave but steamed are good too. Cauliflower app is great.

As for the atmosphere, it's another little gem in Parkdale. It's tranquil and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Looking for Veg momos, we found this treasure serving very tasty veg momos and Indian Chinese food. Mouthwatering momos and lovely people serving make it little more better.

Had Chilli Momos at next visit, awesome man. Hats off to the chef and sweet owner couple."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is AH-MA-ZING!!!!!! Just found our new favourite place to eat. Inexpensive, friendly, and the food was the best thing I've eaten in forever!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for some dumplings. LOVE IT. Especially with the sauce it comes with. It's really flavourful and very fulling."}
{"text":"We, vegetarians have been there twice and both times the food has been wonderful.
First time we came in on Saturday evening, so the place was packed and we were sitting down around the table our boots off. Was comfy, but as also the second time the vent is just above and it gets very cool there, so we had to wear our scarves to keep warm.
Second time we came Thursday evening and were the only people there, we chose again the place on the floor, was again too cold because of the vent, but that was our problem, as after a long day didn't feel like sitting down on a chair.

Staff is wonderful, very attentive, talkative and fast, they listen you out.

Both times food arrived very fast, was hot and delicious. Soy and hot pepper sauces are on the table. We had paneer, vegetable curry and veggie momos. Which come in a box of 10 and taste heavenly, not too spicy even for a mild tolerance as mine. Very enjoyable altogether.

Price range is not the cheapest considering that there is nothing to take home with, as all the food goes down, so the portions are not the biggest.

For somebody who is looking an experience of a new cuisine and is into Tibetan food, this place is heaven. Also many options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"If you've never had Tibetan you are missing out, and this is some of the best.  The place is small and cozy, with really nice, simple decor.  Usually there is some music playing quietly, but I've also been here when a  huge wedding party took over the restaurant (it was very loud!) and when the \"Indian Oscars\" where playing they put up a big TV.  Overall Shangrlla is quiet, and relaxed. The service is fine, but this place really shines when we talk about food and prices.   I highly recommend you start with the crispy cauliflower  ($6) and don't be afraid to get some hot sauce on it.  The Shangrilla Chicken ($8) and the Vegitables in Curry sauce (off the Tibetan page I don't recall the Tibetan name)($7) were both amazing and they came with rice.  Lots of good flavours, fresh ingredients, lots of chillis (!) and good portions.  I will say the chicken was a little on the salty side, but overall, all of the food really impressed me. The three dishes I named are way more than two people would need, uness you were quite hungry, and it's still only $30 with tip!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Butter tea and chilli veg momos, with chilli chutney on the side. The butter tea could have been saltier, though I think he held back. Momos were delicate and quite spicy. Wonderful overall.

Restaurant was otherwise empty, with a few people bustling around getting ready for the dinner service. Will go back one night to eat through more of the menu."}
{"text":"Shangrila is our favourite restaurant! We have been going for years and the food is always deelish!! 
The momo (dumplings) are a must, the crispy cauliflower is swoon worthy, and the paneer manchurian is amazing. My bf has considered marrying the crispy beef. The sekewa is also brilliant. Actually the list goes on... And don't miss the chili tofu. The noodles are made in house so the soups and noodle dishes are great.
We've tried and enjoyed almost everything on the menu. I highly recommend this restaurant. It is casual, but an excellent spot for two or a large group. 
The staff are very friendly and will make the dishes to suit your level of spice preference too.
We eat there with our vegan friends and our carnivorous friends.
Booze is very inexpensive and the food is not expensive either."}
{"text":"Yummilicious food. Great service. Cozy environment and most welcoming staffs. This place has got everything  u r looking for. If u ever come by...dont forget to try tingmo and pork chilly...typical tibetan taste and great combination."}
{"text":"De très bons plats pour moins de $10 par tête, servis copieusement et avec le sourire. Les spécialités du restaurant sont incontournables."}
{"text":"As a vegan, it is difficult to find decent places to eat, and Asian food tends to be most difficult. This place has to be the most accommodating I've experienced. The staff know what's in everything, making substitutions/omissions very easy. And they're happy to do it.

The food is delicious!  Jhol momo, which is a bowl of wonderful, spicy curry soup and steamed dumplings... so good. Try it if you haven't, because it's killer. The veg Shangrila noodle dish is flavourful and spicy (not like other places where the vegetarian options, especially noodles, tend to be bland and flavourless). Ther veg chow mein is also very good. The veg hot and sour soup (sans egg) is perfect, as is the tofu manchurian. The portion size of that one could be a bit bigger for the price, but it's still delicious. But one thing you MUST order when you go, vegetarian, vegan or otherwise, is the crispy cauliflower. And you must try it with one of their hot sauces. It is super. Just a flavour explosion! 

As mentioned, the service is accommodating, knowledgeable and attentive. There is a minimal wait for food most times we go. They are licensed, so you can have a Mill Street Organic or whatever you like with your meal. If you have not been to Shangrila, you MUST go. You won't be disappointed!

PS we found out they have karaoke every last Friday of the month, and we will definitely be checking that out!"}
{"text":"One time I went food was excellent.. The other time I went food was horrible. They must have different cooks.. So depending on when you go you might get lucky or unlucky...

See my pic for the not so good tasting version"}
{"text":"Their crispy cauliflower is AMAZING! For takeout orders, give them an extra 10 minutes on top of what they tell you. It's always pretty busy whenever we've gone in (on Friday or Saturday evening) which makes the wait understandable."}
{"text":"Having tried some of the other Tibetan restaurants in Parkdale I feel like I've finally found my favourite. Not only are there many options of delicious to choose from there are many vegan options for those who care. The staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable in helping you make the best decision to satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"More than ten years after living in a city somewhat close to Tibet in India.. and tasting delicious to die for momos served on the street in an ultra narrow lane.. I finally fine something close to it right here in Toronto! 

My salivary glands have no control near a bamboo box of steamed momos and the perfect hot sauce to accompany it; and Shangrila delivers! 

The chilli chicken and the chili potatoes are delicious too. Some of the other items I've had could be better though else I wouldn't shy from a 5 star rating 

The service is always friendly and courteous. The restaurant itself is very homely and warm. I'm waiting for the day I can steal that large sit down area on the floor with a large group. 

Oh and very decently priced too! Must try"}
{"text":"Our visit was amazing. Taste is simple and yummy. We ordered steamed veg momos/dim sums, crispy cauliflower and chowmein. Everything is yummy!! So happy to find this place."}
{"text":"The last time we were here in Toronto we saw a handful of Tibetan / Nepalese / Himalayan restaurants on queen street west of Parkdale. Hmmmmm never seen that before - to do list! 
Yelp'd it and Shangrila it was, we wanted to sit on the floor and eat! 
Having never tried this food before have to say it was delicious - yes the Momos are the bomb, literally too! We had the steamed ones and when you bite in some soup explodes out! 
It was like Indian food, but not as many layers of spices. Very flavorful and vibrant! We chatted with the owner, he looked Asian but sounded Indian, cool! Very knowledgeable and told us where to go in NYC ( Jackson Heights) for Tibetan food! 
The restaurant was definitely a hole in the wall place, could use a makeover, but will not stop us from coming back to try more things!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Tibetan food and we LOVED it.

It was the two of us and we ordered three things:
1) Vegetarian Momos aka Dumplings
2) Gyuma (blood sausage)
3) Stew called Aloo Phing Tsey.

My favourite dish would definitely be the Momos. The Guyma was a little bit too oily for me personally. However, all the dishes were very tasty. I really liked the decor of the restaurant and the waitresses were friendly and accommodating. Also the dishes are very affordable here. All together everything was a little under $30. 

Final Verdict: I would come back here and try out the other dishes they have to order."}
{"text":"The Tibetan dishes are delicious. The service is good. But I do not recommend any of the \"curry\" dishes. There isn't a hint of curry present."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered: Fried Fish Chilli with Rice, Fried Momos, Gyu-ma and the salted tea. My favourite thing was the Gyu-ma. I know blood sausage isn't for everyone but I loved it. The tea sounded interesting on the menu but I'm sorry, I did not like it at all (I tried!). I would totally go back here and try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We had been to Parkdale last year for Momo's festival and always wanted to try this one.

We came here for lunch on Saturday and were easily able to get a table. We ordered for Hot & Sour Soup, Sweet Corn Soup, Chilli Momo's and Spring Rolls. All the items were very well done. Though the next time I would skip Spring Rolls for another round of Momo's :)

If you're a vegetarian, beware that some items may contain eggs. And the staff doesn't believe that egg is not vegetarian :)"}
{"text":"YUMMY! I am new to the neighborhood and I was looking for some local Asian food.  I did a quick search on Yelp and found Shangrila based on the reviews and a quick check on the city of Toronto's Dine Safe website I decided to try Shangrila.  I have never tried Tibetan food before and boy have I been missing out!  They make the food FRESH and made to order, we tried their house Shangrila noodles and they were fantastic!  You do have to wait a bit for the food, I think we waited almost 30 mins but was it ever worth the wait.  I guess when you make your food fresh to order it certainly makes a huge difference.  Two of us ate for under $25 and we had some leftovers.  Shangrila will now be on our regular rotation of local restaurants, I cant wait to go back and try their momos.  

The service was friendly and courteous and the server did mention that you can call in and \"pre order\"  your food that way you dont have to wait as long when eating there, or just order take out.  Either way I am going back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Tons of seating, and I love the decor. It's also much cleaner than other restaurants in the Parkdale area. The owner is really sweet and welcoming. I've tried veggie momos at other restaurants, so far this restaurant has the most tasty veggie momo. They are also served in a bamboo basket steamer. Price is very affordable. The menu here has tons of options, and has many vegetarian selections. I'll come back on he weekend for their specials!"}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place to taste the lovely chilli sauce they serve . It is extremely spicy and goes very well with any dish. I have tried almost the entire menu here but I love the gyuma"}
{"text":"Delicious food at an incredibly affordable price.  The paneer manchurian had the softest most flavorful paneer we've ever had.  The momos (dumplings) were great fried and with theiri chilli sauce.  The mutton was tender and juicy.  The atmosphere was pleasant with tibetan music and old photographs from Tibet.  For three entrees on a Saturday night, our bill came to $30.  Not bad for the quality of the food and service we received.  The only disappointment at all was the bathrooms which reeked of mothballs and had neither hand towels nor a working hand dryer."}
{"text":"I have been past this place a million times and have never been in or ordered take out until recently. 

It was a cold night and my friend and I wanted soup. I ordered two soups (Hot and sour and a beef flat noodle),crispy cauliflower and tripe for takeout.

The interior of the restaurant is lovely. Very cozy and authentic feeling. I absolutely love Tibetian food so I just had to see what they had to offer.

The staff is friendly and chatted with me while I waited for my take out.  It was ready in a reasonable time too! (I was the only one in the resto).

The soups were lovely. The beef flat noodle was awesome. Fresh tasty broth and the noodles are made in house. Big flat ones. They were soft, not mushy and just what we were craving. The hot and sour soup was really nice as well and we gobbled up both.  The crispy cauliflower was just OK. I wouldn't order it again, but it was something different.

I liked the tripe as well, but not as much as I like Tibetian Kitchen's tripe. 

Overall I would return to try other dishes. The menu looked great and I would love to enjoy the interior of the restaurant while nom-nom'ing on other traditional Tibetian dishes."}
{"text":"It has been quite a while since I last went to Shangrila Tibetan Cuisine, and something seemed different when I went for dinner a few days ago. The restaurant is bright inside with the many coloured prayer flags hanging from the ceiling, bold-coloured décor, and pictures and mirrors on the walls. There is seating for about two-dozen at tables in the front (possibly this furniture is what was different?), a middle section with floor seating, and a small bar at the back. It was not busy as yet, and the service was very quick and friendly. There is a tv in the middle, but the volume was off as music was playing quietly in the background.

I started with the sweet corn soup with chicken which was steaming hot but very good. I then had the Aloo Phingsha, which had a little of pretty much everything in it: broth with thin beef strips, vermicelli, potatoes, black fungus mushroom, and a bowl of rice on the side. It was all delicious, not overly spicy but there is chili sauce to add if you wish. I finished up with my usual cup of butter tea. Their menu has all the expected Himalayan dishes like gyuma sausage, chili chicken, a variety of momos, and assorted curries, along with thali dishes on the weekends. My total bill was $18 for a very filling meal, so well worth it."}
{"text":"Loved it.

Visited on 12/28/11 in the afternoon. We were the only customers there. There was one person (owner?) who was dealing with the kitchen, preparing food for the afternoon and table service. But the food was so good, I really didn't mind having to stick my head into the kitchen when we wanted the check. We're definitely going to go back next time we're in T.O."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant in Parkdale. Food is great, servers are friendly, service is top notch and has a homely feel. They do karaoke on last Friday of the month and it's lit. All the bad singers jam and try to make each other feel good about their singing. On the food side, love their momos, mutton thali, chicken chilli and sekuwa."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place when Partner was craving something spicy for dinner. I had only ever had Tibetan cuisine once before, at another restaurant on the same strip, and had loved it. This place was amazing: small enough to be cozy, but not hipsterish enough to be crowded. You can actually hear your conversation partner(s)! 

The hot \"sauce\" (more of a spice mix) on the table was dead serious. Partner said it was \"like voting for Obama and getting Al Sharpton.\" Definitely wait for your drink to arrive before tasting it.

I had the crispy cauliflower (a must-try) and veggie momos (delish with sriracha and soy sauce). Partner got something with beef in it, which he loved; however there is a plethora of vegetarian options at this place.

Partner finished with some Tibetan tea, made with butter. He loved it, but I wasn't interested.

Service here was polite and prompt. I'd certainly go again, and bring a friend.

Only caveat is that there is a shrine to the Dalai Lama in one corner, which would make me hesitant to bring a super-religious person here.  That being said, I will certainly come back."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Ordered vegetarian food. Friendly service. Hot sauce is too hot but we loved it. Noodles were ok but rest everything was tasty. It was crowded and it did take 15-20 minutes for the food to be ready. I would recommend this place. Love hearing to bollywood songs here."}
{"text":"I don't have much experience with Tibetan food, so I can't compare Shangrila to many other places.  With that said I was very satisfied with my food. The dumplings and curry were pretty good. The meal was a decent price and filled me up."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. On the most recent visit, we dropped by in the early evening to an all-but empty restaurant and were told we could seat ourselves wherever we liked. We had come specifically for the cushion seating, but were immediately asked to choose a different seat. The waitstaff seemed irked with us.

While the spring rolls, broccoli and mushrooms and veggie curry were fine, the rice seemed very stale and hard. The Mango lassi was nice and not too sweet and I love the railroad chai, but I don't think that's going to be enough to lure me back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Shangrila Tibetan. I have been going there for last few years. I have tried almost everything on their menu. My favourite is beef momo's or Joel momo's. Shangrila chili chicken and weekend Chicken/Mutton thali are also my faves. 
Husband and wife who own this restaurant are lovely people. Shangrila tibetan is a great family restaurant with delicious Tibetan food.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves delicious food."}
{"text":"ordered delivery tonight, crispy beef, chilli chicken & mixed veggies, all was inedible, threw it out.  Gross"}
{"text":"I loved the decor and the fact that the family members were cooking and serving. Steam bread was amazing and the other dishes we ordered were authentic and tasty. Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out for a long LONG time and never got around to it (surprise~). With a start of a new job however, a free lunch was given and my new team brought me here for lunch.

I like the atmopshere here - it's rather private and dimmed - perfect to have a one one-on-one session with your bestie or have an intimate dinner with the apple of your eye.
What I love most  is of course, is the back area where you can sit  on the cushions (which I discovered, is a perfect thing to lean on when you reach your itis stage). 

There is very little I can say about this place - the food is good and the atmpsphere is good and most importantly, the service is great also. They're not really a chatty bunch but they make sure you have everything you need.

Definitely worth another few hundred visits:D"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant because of it's high Yelp ratings, I even ordered the recommended dishes (shangrila noodles, spicy crispy beef, and the cauliflower). 

I have to say that the food was bland, lacked any sort of the flavour I would expect from Tibetan and Manchuria cuisine. The noodles were soggy, the beef was tough and gamey...generally not what I would expect from such a highly rated restaurants. 

Will not try again. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Bikng home from Panamania at exhibition and we stumbled upon this nice Tibetan place for dinner. The place is nice and antique. We were seated by the entrance since we wanted to keep an eye out for our bikes but there seems to be more traditional seating towards the back. Ordered chili chicken momos and mutton curry. From what I know about Tibetan food it is a lot like hakka so when I ordered their shangrila chili chicken that was what I expected. However a stir fried chicken in tandoori type of mix was served. I wasn't disappointed. The dish was actually quite good. The spices wasn't over powering, the onion wasn't over cooked and the chicken was tender. The mutton curry was also good. Had a good mutton taste and a dark yellow curry type of sauce. It was so good we practically licked the dish. The momo was OK. The beef momo I found was dry. The chicken had too much cumin but over all not bad. It was a good meal. Good thing we were biking home or I would feel too much of a heffer after that meal."}
{"text":"Good food, very friendly service. Always enjoy the egg drop soup and Crispy Beef. The place is well priced and has become a Parkdale favourite among friends."}
{"text":"Beautiful authentic food. Loved the low seating and ethnic vibe. The momos were superior. The salt tea was so good!"}
{"text":"Both Tibet Kitchen & Shangrila were my first forays into Tibetan food, but if someone were to ask me to describe it, I'd say \"watered down Hakka food\".  At least that's how the food at Shangrila tasted to me.

First, food took FOREVER to arrive to table at just-under 1 HOUR!  To me, that's simply unacceptable, unless the kitchen is being slammed or something.  Restaurant was almost full, but I'd say manageable.

Servers were nice, but they mentioned at the half-hour mark that they had new kitchen staff 'cause people had called in sick.  I think it would've been better if this was mentioned during/after ordering.  Not 30mins in.

Paneer Manchurian - Ok, tasty, gravy was quite watery.  I didn't find it all that spicy.  Do NOT expect it to taste like Indian paneer.

Aloo Phingsha - Waaay too watery and bland tasting.  Tasted sorta like tom yum soup with some Jew's ear fungus, slivers of beef, pieces of tasteless potato, vermicelli, and some other chopped veg floating around.  

Indian Railway Tea (chai) - Good, but too too strong or sweet.  Fresh brewed I can tell, not from a powdered mix.

All in all, I would've had a better first impression if I was pre-warned about the wait time.  Again, to wait an hour for food is a-no.  Servers did seem sweet and apologetic tho.  

Food-wise, I think I may have ordered the wrong items.  Perhaps their drier, fried items are better??"}
{"text":"I recently discovered Momos thanks to a potluck dinner. Craving them and being in Parkdale meant that the fates had aligned. 


Or so I thought. I walked past the resto to go to another equally well rated on Yelp resto up the street to discover it was closed. I doubled back and headed in. 

The restaurant was empty but at 4ish on a Friday I figured it wasn't a sign.

I ordered the mixed Momos which provided me the opportunity to try beef, chicken and veggie. I was also advised by the waitress to try the spicy chilli sauce. I dipped my first chicken momo into the sauce and took a bite. I nearly gagged. Thinking it was the sauce I tried another one sans sauce. I can't even describe how gross these things were. I forced myself to eat them because I really don't like to waste food. I eventually just ate the dough pushing the filling out completely. Not only that but the waitress was MIA the entire time I was eating. I also ordered the sweet and sour soup which was pretty bland and was filled with mystery meat. 

I guess that sometimes it doesn't pay to be adventurous."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spot for Tibetan/Himalayan food in Parkdale.

Service: it's a family run business, so sometimes you might get served by teens (assumed the owners children). But the owners and everyone are friendly, haven't had any bad experience.

Food: I've tried multiple dishes from this place throughout the last couple of years - Thali (meal set), Chicken Chili, Droepa Khatsa (beef tripe), Sekuwa, Gyuma, Ngop Tsai Marlam (mixed veggies)...etc.

They don't have the best Himalayan food I've tried, and definitely close to a second best! Also, be careful on the spice levels of your order - I ordered medium spicy on Droepa Khatsa and it was hot (those tiny chili peppers are EVILLL) enough to make my nose run and eyes water, but again, the sensitivity of my taste buds and my eyes and nose don't match.

P.S. They have a small section of the dining area where you can take off your shoes and sit on the floor with cushions!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times the food is still good, but not the greatest I have had. I must say the ambience of the place is cultural and authentic to the Tibetan customs. Overall I would suggest to at least try this place at least once. I usually have the momos here which are Tibetan dumplings."}
{"text":"I was there on Friday night with my wife. I was greeted by young man which was kinda welcoming. They should do that on regular basis. Generally they don't pay that much attention.

I had chilli fries and hot & sour soup for starter. I like the portion of food. So far this restaurant offer best value of your money. Unlike other Tibetan restaurant where the price is really high and portion is really less. So thumbs up for this restaurant.
 
The young man who served us was very attentive. He was checking our table now and then. He offer to refill water three times. Generally the Tibetan restaurant doesn't care after they drop off food. But He seemed well trained and pay every little details. 
I wish every Tibetan restaurant had such server so that they had best standard of service. 
 
Totally 5 star for food and service of that particular youn man."}
{"text":"The crispy cauliflower... DAMN!!! Sure is good~~~ Then we ordered the steamed chicken momo, which was 10 pieces in a bamboo basket. ALL of them are good, first time trying Tibet food and it was GOOD!! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. There are so many good Tibetan places in the strip but i always end up here. The owner lady is very nice and their chicken momo are to die for. I give them 5-stars. I hope they maintain their quality and hospitality forever."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Prior to this ocassion I've only ever had Tibetan food once in my life. In Vienna, several years ago at that. Based on those 2 experiences I have to say that Tibetan food seems a bit on the bland side for me. However, this place was great for a cheap dinner in the neighborhood.

We had Aloo Phingsha (vermicelli, mushrooms, and beef), Chow mein chicken, Thentuk noodles, and momos. I liked the dumplings, although they were on the heavier side. The vermicelli dish tasted the most unique to me.

Frankly, if the food had more hot spice I would be a big fan."}
{"text":"Shangrila is an intriguing spot on Queen W. The restaurant has an authentic vibe but also caters to the western palate. 

I stopped by with a rather large group of friends one weekend and we managed to order about half of the menu. The service was quite friendly and all of our food arrived at the table in under 15 minutes. The pork chilly, crispy beef and chilly fries were the favourites of our group, while the blood sausage had a mixed reception. We ordered a variety of momos in friend format which I would not advise. I assume the momo in broth will taste better as this version tasted like a weak samosa. Finally the chef's own fried rice left us with a few questions to ask of the chef. On that note, I have noticed very different looking pictures from Shangrila on Yelp and the mention of multiple chefs affecting consistency of the taste. I assume this was a factor in our visit as our food matched more with the pictures from the reviews with lower ratings!! Aside from the food, one can appreciate a restaurant that can sit many people on a Saturday without a reservation. 

Overall, Shangrila is worth a try if you are looking for an interesting hybrid between Indian, Chinese and Thai cuisines."}
{"text":"The server was lovely and smiley. This is a mix of Tibetan, Nepali and Indo-Chinese food. Spring rolls - tasty but dripping oil in a way I've never seen before. Momos were great. Thupka was decent - fresh noodles and broth. Chili chicken and chicken with black bean sauce were ok - not good but not bad either. Fried rice (chef's special) was decent.

Quite a cozy casual spot for dinner. I'd definitely visit again, if just for the momos and the friendly server. Our total bill came to $50 taxes in for all this food. Do make sure to check into your Yelp app to get free soup or soft drink!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the food was absolutely amazing! The menu options were so distinct from what I was used to with typical restaurant. I really enjoyed the authentic feel of the presentation of the food. The staff were extremely friendly and the menu was so affordable!"}
{"text":"Wow, if all Tibetan cuisine is this good then I'm really surprised how it hasn't gained so much popularity. 
First thing I loved about this place was the colourful decoration and their attempt to make it as authentic looking as possible, with the framed picture of Dalai Lama, the flags, and the floor seating. We started off with the vegetarian momo's, but were warned that it will take some time to make. It arrived after around 15 minutes piping hot in a bamboo steam basket. They looked exactly like Chinese dimsums, so I found it really odd not eating them with chopsticks. They served this with their hot sauce. Omg, these momo's were spectacular and with the hot sauce the flavour was even more amplified!
Fortunately, it was a weekend, so I was able to order their thali. I chose the vegetarian one with the fried cauliflower. One friend got the mutton curry with their steamed bread (forgot the name) and my other friend got the paneer Manchurian with rice.
My thali was so simple but this simplicity was what made it so good. The spices and flavours did not hit you in the face, they were very subtle but yet the food seemed so pure, and again, simple, where you can actually taste the ingredients actual flavours. The portion size was perfect and there was free re-fills for the thali, except the fried cauliflower.
The mutton curry was a total hit! He loved it, especially when he soaked the steamed bread into the gravy. I tried the mutton gravy and again, you can actually taste the flavour of mutton rather than just spices. 
The service was great and I will definitely make this place a regular. Next time I gotta try their spicy fries, which I got a glimpse of from the table nearby, and it looked incredible!"}
{"text":"Shangrila is an authentic Tibetan restaurant from the food, the service and the atmosphere.

Family own and runs, I feel like I am dining in a friend place and I did feel right at home and even fell asleep.. (Disclaimer: I was tired since I have been walking and drinking the whole day!)

Tibetan cuisine is quite simple since their climate and geography limited to what they able to produce. Flour, meat and root vegetables are common ingredients used as bases of most of the dishes.

Mixed Momo and Thenthuk (house made noodle in broth) both have this rustic home made feel. There is nothing fancy here but just something comforting.

Service is slow but friendly... or maybe the lighting was just too dim and I just feel too comfortable.. zzzzzz"}
{"text":"Okay so we were a little tentative but something in the air pushed us to try a new spot and thankfully we came across this place!  Atmosphere is warm and comfortable and casual.  Menu is pretty straightforward though the repetition of the same dishes in the front middle and back of the menu had us wondering if for the same price you could have an appetizer , main or special sized plate!  The momos were reminiscent of Chinese dumplings with a hint of curry or maybe tumeric.  Glad we tried those.  The hand shaved noodles are delicious but the broth was a little too spicy for me,great texture though.  Their cauliflower did not disappoint.  You get worried sometimes when you see things like 'house specialty', but I actually think this was my favorite dish of the night.  Will go back and try more of the menu, round 1, a success."}
{"text":"We love this place! we go here probably 1 out of every 5 times we dine out.

There are so many options for vegetarians, and the steamed buns are perfect for sopping up all the delicious broths.

We always get one of the many dishes that feature handmade noodles and some momo's that come steamed or fried. 

Also, I would suggest trying the Potato Chilly, which is just French Fries in a sweet garlic chili sauce but it's amazing! 

The place is licensed with beers on tap and bottle and the Indian railcar tea is delicious as well.

It is criminal how under the radar this place is because the quality of food, Atmosphere, value and staff are all 5 stars."}
{"text":"We've lived around the corner for years and are finally attempting to try some new places in the 'hood instead of relying on delicious old standbys.

We ordered :: Vegetable Curry, Fried Veggie Momos, Broccoli & Mushroom + Steamed Rice.  It was all delicious.  There was a large family party happening towards the kitchen that was a bit overwhelming noise-wise but our servers were so friendly and advised us on how to order since this was our first time having Tibetan food.

Looking forward to going back and trying more dishes!"}
{"text":"Walking along Queen Street West we discovered a little Tibetan place called Shangrila. The place was long and narrow and flanked by mirrors on either side of the walls. It had a dark atmosphere that recalled other Tibetan places I have been, with some funky flourescent fixtures that seemed to buzzing and flickering continually while we were there. The table cloth and menus were more than a little worn making us wonder about the quality of the food. We ordered a couple of different mains, some spicy fish and some spicy beef, some steamed bread and a selection of tibetan dumplings called momos (pan-fried vegetarian and steam beef). Everything was delicious, infused with flavour and spice. It was a pleasant surprise. The more we ate the better the food became and the atmosphere more friendly and inviting. When the bill arrived we were delighted to discover we had eaten so well for an inexpensive price. Shangrila will be added to our list of regular restaurants."}
{"text":"A friend took me here last night so that I could try something new and it was fantastic!

We both got an order each of the fried beef momo ($8.99) and my friend also got an order of the chicken fried rice ($6.99). 

The momo was fantastic! I especially loved the house chili sauce that they came with. It gives a great kick! I didn't end up having any of the rice since the order size of the momo was perfect to fill me up, but my friend cleaned his plate, so I assume it was really good as well, lol.

The service was also top-notch, very friendly and the prices are unbeatable. We've already decided that we'll be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, the MoMo's we're delicious! If you get them though be careful of the soupy liquid in them! It's the best part!!
Oh, and they have HOMEMADE chow mein noodles!!!!! The crispy beef is one of their signature dishes and I personally found it a bit hard, but the sauce was still delicious.
We will definitely be back for more MoMo's and to try and few more things!
PS. Their hot sauce is amazing... We had some left over and I put them into home made burgers the next night..., delish!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Good value for large portions that taste great. The service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Food *1/2
Service ****
Ambience **

Really nice people work a this restaurant but the food is pretty bad.  I've read a couple reviews that there are different cooks, and one is good while one is bad.  

My food had a strange taste to it - like the noodles had chemicals in them. I also had the chlli shrimp and the sauce tasted like straight tomato/ketchup sauce.   The crispy Beef was not crispy.

I had really high hopes but this experience was underwhelming so I probably won't return."}
