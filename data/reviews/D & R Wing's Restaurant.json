{"text":"I eat here alllll the time! And i always get the same thing. Curry fish with rice. I have to say its much better than the chicken version. They prepare it better. Service is okay by asian restaurant standards... theyre usually pretty nice. Price is amazing. Portions are huge so i share it with a second person and the bill comes upto about $10 in total. I love this place!"}
{"text":"It is always been a challenge going there if you dont speak Chinese. If I am lucky they would have one waitress that would be able to communicate basic English. A few of the food is okay- for the price you pay esp the steak. But the chicken a la king and curry are a joke. The service is horrible - which is not surprising for a cheap eatery like this."}
{"text":"This place Is an amazing hidden gem in scarborough! I guarantee you won't be disappointed! The servers are the nicest people you will come across! They're like a big family!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was not the cleanest, and I will not mention the bathroom. Staff wasn't friendly, like they were doing us a favor. It's just another, plain Chinese place... Nothing special..  Cheap(inexpensive)...that's about all I can say."}
{"text":"My parents are the regulars of this establishment. Been coming here since I was a kid and things here don't change that much. The restaurant has renovated nicely but I'm too chicken to go into the washroom cause I know it's gross. If someone wants to go in and tell me it's fine, be my guest.   Pretty cheap with their all day breakfast and dinner specials. Their specials usually come with soup and salad too.   Since I only come here with my parents, who know basically everyone that works here (waitresses and cooks), service here is good. It's not hard to befriend them if you come here regularly, so talk it up~  They tend to accommodate to my mother's very bland and healthy palate so if you have dietary restrictions, don't hesitate! She's changed baked fish rice to boiled fish with rice...what.   Parking is shared with other restaurants but it shouldn't be a problem. No free wifi unfortunately.   Also, I'm eating baked ham and chicken with white sauce on rice while writing this."}
{"text":"This restaurant had been around a long time, probably dating back to the time the condo towers around it were being built.  Their staying power is a testament to the simple formula they follow - offer a limited menu, do it well, and charge very reasonable prices for it.  As an example, their lunch specials is maybe 8 -10 items, with nothing over $10.00  Like any typical HK Cha Chan Teng, you get a choice of soup, a main dish, and a choice of drink to complete the meal.  Food quality was average.  Not the freshest, best ingredients, but ok.  The service was ok too.  Tea was refilled several times throughout the meal without being asked.  I saw the servers bantering  with regular customers, a good sign.  The 1 star reviews are most likely from customers from the same table who had an misunderstanding with their server that day."}
{"text":"The service is not great, a fat lady behind the countertop working as a bar hop doesn't have good attitude, it's her every time. I was checking up on our drinks to a waitress, and when the waitress told the bar hop woman that, she responded with \"So what? Why should I care?\" And because of that one lady, I will never ever come back again."}
{"text":"Ok this place is by far my number one to go to place (when I have cash) D&R is a great place to eat especially during lunch when thy have their lunch special,   The food is amazing my top option is the curry chicken with rice, it's truly a dish to try and fall in love with, the lunch special consists of the weeks special; which can be either chicken, beef or pork curry, fish flay or an adoption of noodles. The Special comes with soup,  and a drink for about $9. Looking at the price to the quantity of items it's a good deal.   Service wise they don't speak the greatest English but you can definitely get your message across and not get the wrong order   WARNING THEY DO NOT TAKE CARDS OF ANY KIND ONLY CASH!!!    You have been warned, but truly I suggest this restaurant to anyone that wants a warm hardy dish"}
{"text":"I`ve been coming to this restaurant since they took over the location from Tin`s.   Hong Kong style cafes are on the one hand pretty much the same in what they offer, but they all do the same menu items just a little different...at least that has been my experience.   This is the one we keep coming back to.   My idea of comfort food....I usually like everything on their specials menu....especially on week-ends.   Anything curry, anything black pepper, etc...  We get great friendly service (maybe because we are regulars) and there is usually too much food for one sitting so we almost always have leftovers to eat later."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment for many years now and the one thing that I can tell you about this restaurant is how amazing the taste of the food really is. This is pretty much a traditional Hong Kong style restaurant in terms of the menu selection. I would definitely recommend coming to this restaurant for breakfast,lunch and tea break. The all day breakfast menu is very delicious . I would recommend the combo of fried eggs with toast and a Satay Beef Udon in Soup. For lunch, I would try the baked rice dishes or their famous Curry Chicken on rice. Although the decor may look a bit outdated even after renovations, I would still come to D&Rs for a quick lunch especially for the students from the nearby school, Dr. Norman Bethune Collegiate Institute, who would want a quick lunch during lunch hour."}
{"text":"The food is fine. I occasionally come here for breakfast out of convenience. This place serves typical Western Hong Kong food. I don't like their milk tea though because I think it's too bitter."}
{"text":"One of the neighbourhood's HK style cafe that has been around for a long time. Quite busy through out the day. So that is always a good sign of returning clients.   Venue can be described as blend and simple? But this place isn't about venues or decor.   Food wise, it is above average in terms of quality. They do make their food fast. So I ordered the baked fish casserole with cream sauce. It tastes just okay, more on the blend side? The quantity of fish fillets is pretty good. Just the pasta wasn't al dente (yeah, I've been spoiled by real Italian food).   Service wise, the staff are on the ball. Got good attitude. So overall, not bad in terms of experience. But not great?"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????dd.????????????d?????????????????????????????6.50"}
{"text":"Let`s be honest here, has anyone really stepped into one of these restaurants expecting \"oh I better get some 5 star service and food\". I mean look at the place, it's just a small family restaurant with questionable coloured sauces and loud waitresses. Jokes aside, the food really isn't bad and their wings during tea time are fantastic. Price-wise, although everything has gone up in price many times, it still falls under the category of \"reasonable\".  Verdict: yeah sure ok.   If you're in the area and don't know what to eat and don't have high hopes and expectations. This place has a decent amount of options and you can get away with paying less than $10 a person.  That's all."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week as I live close by. Just your typical HK style cafe. I like getting the breakfast combo items or sandwiches as a light meal. Lunches are also good and cheap.  My favourites: 1) Instant noodle combo with eggs and toast 2) B.L.T. sandwich  Meals come with a drink! Lemon tea and milk tea are good."}
{"text":"This time was not so great. Yeah they gave us our cream soup for free (soup is 3.50 - overpriced) but this is an anomaly at HK style cafes. Meals usually come with soup anyway.  The one star is for when the waitress very rudely and loudly tapped the tray with our money on it and told us to tip more, because they had given us the soup for free... which honestly we were not even aware of until she mentioned it. It would have been fine if not for the last 30 seconds we were there. I don't expect stellar service from Asian places, especially HK style cafes. Didn't even care when she didn't even look at us or talk to us when she took our order. Or when she questioned why we we were only getting two meals for three people. But asking us to tip more after we had given a reasonable one is deserving of my first one star review."}
{"text":"I remember the days when D&R Wing's used to be in the Buttonfield Plaza, the same place as where Hai Tang Cafe is now. Those were the glory days of this place, but several years ago they moved to the Bamburgh plaza and I haven't visited here until a few days ago.  Decorations were...well there isn't much, it's a HK style cafe focusing on bang for your buck. It's a family restaurant, take it or leave it.  What I like about this place is that they have all day breakfast. I ordered a breakfast meal for my dinner...love it! For $5.50 you can get two eggs, bread, and a decent size of satay beef instant noodle (as an example). The quality is on par for the price you pay, hence the 4 stars.  If you're a frugal person looking for something to fill you up...this is definitely the place for you. This and Yogi Noodle are both excellent choices in the plaza to be honest."}
{"text":"Thought I give this place a try since its been here for ages but this is going to be my first and last at his place. Their decor and furniture needs some serious TLC. Carpeted floors and chairs that are used back in the 70s and if this place were given a rating on cleanliness it would be a C....their prices are cheap and selection is limited, seems like a lot of ppl get their sandwiches which ranges from $3-$4....quality of food is not that good, my sister found a piece of hair in her noodle (grosssssssssss)....a lot of ppl come here but it seems to be the frequent comers as the waitress are chatting away with them   Go down 5 mins on south warden to me congee for much better and cleaner food"}
{"text":"All their food is deep fried so that we don't know how fresh the meat is. So we came with a friend and ordered Portuguese chicken, black pepper chicken and a cream soup. everything had a nice fried layer on it except the soup, which is far from fresh. the portions are good though, for the price. after we finished and we got the bill, the waitress wouldn't take the money because we hadn't tipped enough. yes, she didn't take the bill back after I paid (with 10?) for a very mediocre service. would not recommend"}
{"text":"The service here is below average. They put the menus down with an attitude, and proceeded to collect my utensils before I was done eating.  The food is comparable to HK's fast food Chinese food. The food was lukewarm, and the chicken was so deep fried I couldn't tell if I was eating a rock or chicken.  The worst part about all of this, is when we asked for the bill, she had the audacity to raise her voice and complain about the lack of tips, despite us not receiving any.   If you're reading to determine if this place is worth going to, I suggest Pho 88 or JeonJuHyang next door instead."}
{"text":"Honestly, although the place doesn't have fancy decor, if you're looking for value Chinese food here is the place to go! Food comes in big portions at reasonable prices. They always have a specials menu that comes with soup, drink, salad and main course for under $10! They have many options from Hong Kong style lunch to Cafe food and although they aren't super modern, they are definitely a local fave."}
{"text":"This place is OK... NOT the best, but definitely not the worse.  Their price point is not too bad, and has all sorts of daily specials- True Breakfast special - only during breakfast hours, All Day Breakfast, Lunch Special (which is served all day), Tea Time Specials (NOT served all day), Sizzling Plate, Dinner, Noodle, Single Item Sandwich, Double Decker Sandwich... and then their regular menu items if those specials don't tickle your fancy.   Their meals all come with your choice of Soup (Chinese or Russian Borscht), and Tea/ Coffee.  Their food is a-ok to fill you up but don't expect fancy well prepared foods.   They do have a liquor display but there are no pricing on their alcohols anywhere... maybe more for show? There is no TV showing the latest ASIAN IP-TV drama or news channel.  Just a no frills go in, stuff your face silly and go on your way joint."}
{"text":"I have no idea why D & R Wing's is called D & R Wing's!! Guys, don't get too excited.. this is not a Chicken Wings and Beer drinking place.. they don't even has a LCBO license and you won't find any of their TV showing any sport games,  it is just another HK style Chinese Cafe!  Lunch Specials from $5.99 that includes a soup and tea/coffee and yes you have to endure the indifferent services unless you are one of the regulars. All these older male regular patrons flirting with the waitresses did give me some sort of entertainment aside from the Chinese TV program showing on one of their TVs.  Curry Chicken Lunch Set ($5.99) - There is nothing authentic about HK style cafe's curry.. it is more like a yellowish coloured curry look alike gravy with dark chicken meat and potato flowing inside - Huge portions of rice that will make any rice loving guys or growing teens happy  D & R Wing's Restaurant is always crowded!! As I overheard the older couple next to me just finishing up lunch specials and now discussing what they should order for afternoon tea specials.. and I won't be surprise they might linger around till the dinner specials!!  Cash Only!"}
{"text":"It's decent quality, decent portions and the typical type of service you would expect at a HK style cafe.   Every time I come here, I either get the chicken stewed noodles ($6.50) or the All day breakfast #3 that comes with eggs, toast and the beef satay udon ($6.25). I honestly don't really know why I like the chicken stewed noodles, but the taste is great, portion is big and the chicken is tender. As for the udon, it's a tad smaller, but the satay sauce mixed with the udon is tasty."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I were feeling a bit frugal so after glancing around where to eat in Bamburgh Plaza we ended back up at D&R.  I haven't really been going back there for a while because there's just too much food at home now.  They have repainted the place and the waitresses are in uniform now.  Looks a bit cleaner now.  Anyway, we decided to get the dinner special.  I like coming here for dinners and figuring out what the dinner special of the night is, sometimes I like it sometimes I don't.  However, last night wasn't too bad.  It was a sirloin steak on a sizzling platter with corn, broccoli and gravy.  It comes with potato salad and house soup.  The house soup was a bit bland today, most likely because it was a new batch.  Maybe they thought I liked it, but I don't really like chicken feet.  The potato salad was okay.    However, the quality of the steak is pretty good for the price we paid overall.  The steak was juicy and fragrant.  Easy to cut and the gravy enhanced the flavor overall.  Also this is the only place that make cold honey lemon tea (tong ling ma cha) with no extra charge (aside from the cold drink upgrade)  With the cold drink upgrade and a pop for my wife we paid $20.50 inclusive of  taxes and tip."}
