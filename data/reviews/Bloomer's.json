{"text":"I've been travelling a lot lately and in the time I was away having fun and eating lots of great food, Bloomers opened and I was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this (still) new vegan cafe and bakery in Bloorcourt.

So finally,I got to visit them today. 

First impressions are: I love the wide open space, that there are multiple options for seating (booths, tables, high tables, etc). They've got free wifi (I didn't look for power outlets this time). Service was really nice and friendly. And I felt pretty comfortable just hanging out with my coffee for a bit

Today I saw a couple of different kinds of donuts, fluffy coconut donut holes, chocolate chip cookies, butter tarts, blueberry tarts, BAGELS, and a donut Bread pudding, and probably more, but I was especially drawn to the bagels, as I haven't seen bagels around any of the fine vegan bakeries we have in our city AND I happen to really like bagels (and usually end up making them myself). as an added bonus they had tofutti cream cheese available. 

They've got a variety of kombuchas, teas, blue sky soda, and assorted bottled fruit juices, in addition to fancy (and more regular) coffee options. 

I hear there is a menu extension coming in September with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so I'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears.

I liked it here, I would (and will) be back again soon. 

Accessibility-wise: Today the door was wide open (otherwise it's not powered), but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in. And  in a wonderful departure from the usual Toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floor.

And regarding one of the other reviews... it seems a little (no, it seems a lot) ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe."}
{"text":"The bagle and donut were amazing!!but two servers were rude.They didn't say \"Thank you\" even \"bye\" when I leave.It doesn't mean they didn't realize me.Definitely they saw my eyes.They were just busy for chatting."}
{"text":"great baked goods and coffee! nice quiet environment and friendly staff. yummy and fresh vegan options."}
{"text":"Very nice Cafe. Stopped off here on my visit to TO. The food was good! As a advantageous carnivore that's saying something. Good selection of teas as well!"}
{"text":"Really hip place for vegan donuts. Food is amazing ordered tofu club. Was amazing and had the hibiscus donut. Friend ordered sunflower cheese pouting. Was alright. Donuts are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love the concept, the atmosphere, the service, the presentation and the location. Very sadly, the only thing I did not like was the food, it was way to greasy for my taste. I only had a sandwich and a salad, but now I am scared to try out more."}
{"text":"Really lovely vegan food cafe. The donuts are delicious,  and the bagels are amazing!

I've had several items now, from the wakame bowl, to soups, to sandwiches, and the poutine.  NOT ever did even one dish disappoint. I've yet to make it in for their specials (which you can see on instagram), but I've made many attempts and each time the items sold out. 

The soups change ever day, and come with a tasty piece of bread. HONESTLY --- I have no idea how they manage to make their bagels and bread so good. 

Please note,  a lot of their baked goods sell out,  like the donuts and bagels,  so you might have to come back if you come at the end of the day.

Pair the food with a Live kombucha drink or one of their many coffees/ciders and you are good to go."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times...but it's everything I look for in a vegan cafe. Nice atmosphere, great menu, and there's always a bunch of yummy desserts. Prices are great too (about $8 for a sandwich). They could probably improve on their service though, its a bit lukewarm."}
{"text":"The reuben was flavourful but on the salty side for sure. I tried the mac and cheese and tbh I can make better vegan mac. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"We wanted something different for our brunch wedding reception \"cocktail hour\", so we reached out to the vegan bakeries in town about ordering mini cinnamon buns. Bloomer's was quick to reply and coordinate a reasonable price, pickup timing, and were happy to accommodate my request to have half with raisins (and made my dad very happy). The cinnamon buns were a huge hit and we're both tasty and cute looking. Bloomer's was the perfect vendor for us and expectations were more than met!"}
{"text":"Bloomers is a good mix of things. It's a cafe and a restaurant, open later than most indie coffee places. They strike a good balance between healthier veggie bowls and the greasy vegan fried food that this city seems obsessed with right now. Overall, the food is very flavourful, not expensive and there are a variety for options (even for drinks: booze, coffee, juices and even kombucha).

Tempeh Reuben: this sandwich is a punch in the face of flavour. The tempeh is awesomely thick-cut. Comes with mustard and pickles. Only downside is that it's a little greasy.

Caesar salad: strange and salty. The romaine was nice and the vinaigrette was light and garlicy but not the expected creamy dressing. The toppings were strange and were what made it so salty. Just lettuce and the vegan caesar dressing from Through Being Cool would have been miles better.

Pulled Jack: messy and delicious. The BBQ sauce is sweet and not too smokey. The jackfruit is actually pulled and was tender, like actual pulled pork. Definitely a do-again. (Would so be so good in a whole wheat wrap, like burrito-style.)


Open salad: the tomatoes tasted like they were from a real garden. Sweet potato is a novel addition but was undercooked. The sesame dressing may not have been the right choice for this salad in general."}
{"text":"Finally tried the famous rose pistcho donut via The cold pressery in mississauga.  You guys don't   disappointed!!!  It's not just the flavour it's the yummy ohey goey dough .....so fresh and thick."}
{"text":"I heart Bloomer's! 

I love the space, the vibe and the delicious vegan treats. There is a great selection of gluten free items (I especially love the banana date or zucchini choc chip muffins) and an expanding menu to include lunch! 

I went last week with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed an incredible potato, celery & garlic soup. My gluten-consuming boyfriend LOVED his donut, fresh out of the oven and I was really pleased with one of the aforementioned muffins. 

They've got a lovely selection of teas from Herbal Infusions (as well as coffee and kombucha) and it's a great place to chill and get work done with free wifi and comfy booths.

Really excited that they've just added gluten free bread to the menu and can't wait to have one of their new sandwiches!!

It's a stellar addition to the neighborhood, and Alex & Kelly couldn't be more awesome humans."}
{"text":"Bad, slow service. We walked in, with no acknowledgement from the staff so sat ourselves at one of the empty tables and grabbed a menu that was left behind. We proceeded to wait 10 minutes but no staff came our way. There were three tables with customers who had finished eating. No one else was waiting for food... Shitty. This is the type of thing that will make this restaurant go under. Bye bye Bloomer's."}
{"text":"So glad to have discovered this spot in the bloorcourt neighborhood.  Lovely vibe, great lattes, and a great menu!"}
{"text":"Bloomer's is my favourite vegan cafe in the city! The baked goods are to die for (made fresh daily) and the owners are lovely and chill. This place has amazing energy. 

Can't wait until they expand to a full menu, which I've heard is coming soon."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found Bloomer's and it is so close (too close?) to home.

The owners and staff are fabulously lovely and the food is to die for.
The first thing I tried was their Doughnut Breadpudding with Salted Caramel Sauce. OMG.
I then promptly ordered a whole one to bring to a family gathering, it was SO good.

I'm really looking forward to the menu extension coming next month :)"}
{"text":"I went into this place with high expectations, looking to get a warm cup of Matcha on this rainy day, when the barista  rudely corrected me saying \" Let me correct you its pronounced MAKA\" and I thought to myself maybe I have been or maybe she doesn't know herself, so I didn't think anything of it.
A few minutes later she brought over a drink which was indeed the wrong drink, she gave me a MACA latte. Frustrated, I confronted her she insisted I was the wrong one and that a MACA latte was what I ordered. She refused to correct my order and insisted I pay for it! 
What kind of stubborn individual works in the customer service industry and forces people to pay for things they never ordered in the first place and makes them feel like they are in the wrong and never admit to their own lack of Cafe beverages. 
Will never go back, Terrible, rude Batista and service!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Bloomer's on a weekly (or more frequent) basis for a year and a half. It is far and away my favourite restaurant in Toronto. The owners are amazing and the staff I've gotten to know are incredibly nice and very helpful.

There is a great range of sandwiches, bowls and salads, as well as loaded fries, onion rings, deep fried pickles etc. I've tried almost everything on the menu (in many cases several times over) and it's all delicious as heck. On the whole, there are no things I order more than others, because there are just so many great options. 

Oh and they have a huge number of incredible baked goods--donuts, muffins, cookies, cinnamon buns, tarts etc. They are my family's go to for birthday cakes we don't make ourselves.

If you want to go to a great sandwich and salad and dessert shop in Toronto--go to Bloomer's. And then go back. They are lovely and great."}
{"text":"To my dismay, yet like so many blossoms, my love for Bloomer's has peaked and prematurely shriveled. 

Many moons ago, when I first tried the Portobello and Kimchi sandwich, I was blown away. Flavour, texture, proportions - bang on. Naturally, I came back for more. Again and again and again! (It's five minutes from my house.) Yet with each order, the portobello portion of said sandwich noticeably diminished. \"Kind of lame,\" I thought to myself, but it was still a solid sandwich. However, the last time I came in, the sandwich consisted of one puny mushroom cap & the saddest sprinkling of kimchi I've ever seen. Deal breaker. There was more bun than anything else, and it was no pleasure to consume. What happened?? Improperly trained cooks? Inadequately stocked rations? Stingy owners? Can't say for sure, but I'd lean towards the latter since their loose leaf tea bags have also drastically decreased in fullness so much so that what I drank with my lightly-dressed-bun-called-\"sandwich\" was more like very mildly flavoured hot water. The experience left me feeling utterly ripped off and compelled to share this tale with others. 

I'll likely come back for the odd cookie or whatnot, but nothing more. Regular customer status: lost. Poor show, Bloomer's. I miss the way we used to be."}
{"text":"Omg - my friend brought me a vegan burger from this Bloomer's place, and it was spectacular. All crunchy and fresh, no or very little processed oil (so rare) - it was a mix of all sorts of fantastic raw shredded veggies, with a very fresh dressing. I'll definitely be back. It's so exciting to walk into a restaurant and know for sure that I won't get a random unwanted chunk of animal flesh in my sandwich. My friend is a non-vegan, and he loved his sandwich as much as I loved mine."}
{"text":"We popped into this place to see if they had anything vegan, and were pleasantly surprised to find that everything was. A great find for dessert! Friendly and pleasant service, with a warm and inviting atmosphere.

The lemon donut was so full of flavour that it almost tasted fake. It was hearty and delicious, but not too heavy, and bursting with lemon. The cinnamon bun was also fantastic, with an excellent faux cream cheese icing. We finished with a chocolate cupcake, whose wrapper I licked without shame. The hot chocolate they whipped up for us on the spot, even though it wasn't on the menu, was also tasty. There's also a long list of teas.

They even had board games, but we didn't have a chance to try them out this time. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"i want to thank the great server that suggested the gluten free banana walnut bread it was really delish i wonder what he will suggest next"}
{"text":"I can and will eat here every time I come to town. Great food, great atmosphere. It can be hard to get a table, but they're super friendly staff will be more than helpful. And 100% vegan. Love this place."}
{"text":"If I could go here everyday, I would. But I no longer live near bloor and have moved more uptown so I definitely come by once in awhile for some awesome treats. 
I love Bloomer's, at first I was unsure weather they would be any different from other vegan places and they would be bland, but they are quite the opposite. 
I love their doughnuts / doughnut holes. They are my favourite doughnuts in Toronto (I'm sorry but I went to beechwood doughnuts and no one can beat them). I love that their doughnuts taste fresh and their dough seems to have more effort than just being deep fried and bland which I find is the case at some other vegan spots in the area. My only complaint is that I wish they had a more variety of doughnut flavours on a daily basis because well I've tried them all and I want more!
The atmosphere is really nice, even with limited seating. I've tried their other baked goods such as their cinnamon rolls and bagels and I love them too. 
I've had their food before and their sandwiches are good as well, but I'm more of a dessert kind of person anywho. 
Good vibe, good food, keep it up!"}
{"text":"French Fries, Bagels, Donuts! 
Carb loading. 
Very laid back very friendly staff. Highly recommend the authenticity of the place. 
Food is tasty."}
{"text":"Simply the best. Their baked goods are amazing, the cobb salad is the dark horse and all of their sandwiches are delicious."}
{"text":"Im not Vegan but I LOVE coming here. Great pulled Jack fruit sandwich, wicked good Caesar salad and killer killer killer desserts. Better than Bunners. Omg I said it"}
{"text":"Having tried the mushroom burger and the club sandwich, I can't say that they were that great. Serving them both on white bread is perplexing. The donuts for dessert weren't good. Nice to have another vegan place on Bloor West, though."}
{"text":"This is my very favourite place. Chilled out, great for meeting people or doing some work (power outlets everywhere and reliable wifi), great value delicious vegan food, including amazing bakery treats, and tasty coffee. Also excellent for dinner or a great selection of drinks in the evening. Ingredients for all the bakery goods are listed with the price in the display cabinet, which is really helpful for people with food allergies. 
The staff are super lovely; the kind of people that you'd want to come have drink with of an evening."}
{"text":"Overall this place is great. 
If you're looking for tasty vegan food that's still somewhat health oriented, this is the place to go. They have a wide selection of salads, bowls and sandwiches.

The Cobb salad is literally to die for, hands down best vegan Cobb I've ever tried. Also the yegg salad is definitely worth trying if you're vegan and miss regular egg salads. It's scarily similar to the real thing. The \"other\" salad/bowl is also quite delicious. The sandwiches and burgers are over seasoned and too saucy, they need to tone it down a bit on them. The tempeh Reuben is overpowering and the chunks of tempeh were not fully cooked when we got it, would not recommend the tempeh Reuben. The soups are usually flavourful and filling. 

I've only ever had some of the raw desserts and the butter tart. The raw desserts are amazing, do yourself a favour and get the snickers bar of you're feeling like a treat!!! You won't regret it. The butter tart however, is sickly sweet and way to runny. I've never tried their donuts but I've heard good things. 


They have a nice selection of drinks, their lattes are good and they have a wide varieties of teas.

The service is great and the staff are super friendly and down to earth. I had a lot of questions when I went and they were able to answer all of them. 

Definitely one of the best vegan spots in Toronto, good for a casual muffin and coffee meet up or a date night!"}
{"text":"Be careful. Gluten free buns have egg. I am so tired of vegetarian restaurants in Toronto who purchas their gluten free bread from the same company that puts egg in their products...egg = animal products = no longer vegetarian."}
{"text":"I want to start off by stating: I am a carnivore. Simulated meat is usually a major turn off for me. But I'm not super picky and I'm open to trying mostly anything. By default, because I moved around the corner, I started going to Bloomer's because I was new to the hood' and it was recommended to me by some ladies in my yoga community. 

THIS PLACE IS THE BEST. I go there all the time. You don't have to be vegan to love this spot. 

Weekend lazy mornings are for tumeric lattes and the DONUTS. Hands down, the best donuts I have ever tasted in my life. 

Other favs: 

- Kimchi Fries
- Wakame Bowl
- Tempeh Reuben Sandwich
- Tempeh Wings *Siracha Spicy*

Atmosphere is cute and service is super friendly.  

I usually do take out because I live one minute away. 

I'm craving the kimchi fries as I write this review... Mmmm...."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan -- but I will give up real cream cheese for their bagel and cream \"cheese\" any day of the week...and (if I remember correctly) they have some kind of chocolate zuchinni muffin that is AWESOME..."}
{"text":"Recently I often go there.  I tried a cup cake before and it was not that good, so I tried hot chocolate with coconut milk. The hot chocolate was very good. Bloomer's is a trendy cool cafe. Customers and staff are cool. They are a vegan place. If you want to bring a friend who loves cow milk, be careful because Bloomer's do not have cow milk for coffee."}
{"text":"**5 STARS SO THIS WOULD BE VISIBLE**  I give this place NEGATIVE ZERO. 

I had such high expectations for this place and I was disgusted and disappointed with my experience here. My friend and I walked in with no acknowledgment from staff so we waited by the cash register thinking that someone would eventually come and speak to us. After a few mins, we realized customer service was lacking we grab menus and seated ourselves. There was a man and woman l going around serving people so eventually, the woman came over to us with the most nonchalant attitude, took our orders without writing it down and left to serve others around us. I asked for a large vanilla soy latte which I got in a regular size mug with no vanilla so I kindly asked the man to just add it in. It took about 5 mins to get my latte back which was remade and still no vanilla in it. I didn't understand why the drink was remade but I just dismissed it and drank it anyways. I ordered the tofu club with pickled onions so when the sandwich came out and I started eating it, they had added avocado spread to my sandwich and I AM ALLERGIC TO AVOCADO. I gave the staff the benefit of the doubt thinking that I must have missed the part that said avocado was in the sandwich. I checked the menu and it said: \"add avocado for $2\". No one asked for avocado so at this point I was livid! The woman came back with a new sandwich which I couldn't even end up eating because I was bloating and cramping. She had the audacity to serve me a half ass apology and offered a \"donut or something\" for my allergic reaction. I was completely done at this point so I packed the sandwich to go and went up to pay for the bill. Of course I did not pay for my sandwich but they were smart enough to charge me for a large cup of coffee when my friend ordered a small. I had to go to shoppers to buy allergy medication. I had enough with the staff and their service.I was so embarrassed for hyping up this place to my non-vegan friend. Needless to say, I will not be returning nor will I be recommending people here. 

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."}
{"text":"best vegan restaurant I've been to in Toronto. got the pulled jackfruit sandwich and kimchi fries, their vegan poutine is amazing as well. heard good things about the tempeh wings, look at their Instagram page for all the amazing pics of their menu and food items"}
{"text":"Bloomers has quickly become my favourite cafe in Toronto. The fact that it's vegan is the cherry on top. It has a great atmosphere with lots of seating, and more importantly, everything I've had so far has been delicious. The owner, Kelly, is lovely and seems to be behind the counter most---if not all---days. This is definitely a local business worth supporting. I highly recommend the cowboy cookie and tempeh reuben!"}
{"text":"Solid meal here with my veg sister! 
We shared the wakame bowl and the the jackfruit sandwich. The sandwich really did have a familar zest to it, like it was a pulled pork sammy. Enjoyable! The wakame bowl was super fresh as well, and I liked the bite from the sauerkraut. Fun for both the omnivore and those on a plant-based diet. 
The place was not packed on a Sunday night, but comfortable. Wine in water glasses help make this a nice and casual spot, that is healthy but also lets you indulge."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are great and the americanos and espressos are good, but they don't have real milk (no latte) and the internet is bad and not reliable."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 
But I have to lean on the 3 side for this one.

I went here to get take out for my coworker and I. Ordered two veggie salads.

The Good:
1. Ambience. It's a very cool spot with awesome decor.
2. Taste. The salad I had was very good.

The Bad:
1. Slow. I've never waited so long for salad in my life. It was dead in there, and it took 30 minutes for them to make 2 salads. That is a key way to ensure I never come back.
2. Price. It's pretty expensive for a salad that just had veggies in it. My salad was $13 plus tax (and tip that I should not have gave)

Recommendation: it's a pretty solid place with good salads, but if you're in a hurry or on a budget - skip it."}
{"text":"Cute cafe location with great service. I only tried sweets-the lemon poppy seed cake and espresso donut were very yummy."}
{"text":"I just know here from searching bakery in Toronto. Also this place is pretty cozy and peaceful. I tried blueberry donut cuz the colour is so pretty ( I just thought that it is definitely raspberry flavour tho lool) It was the best doughnuts ever I tried... ! Sooo fluffy and super soft. Obviously I will come back soon !"}
{"text":"a really cute place with great food! i only tried the sprinkle cookie which was good, but not great. pricing was decent. a great location being right on bloor street, especially because there aren't many vegan restaurants around."}
{"text":"I really hope that the food is not as poor as the service. I went there tonight really looking forward to the experience,  and I have to say, I was extremely put off by the poor service.  After two staff members made eye contact directly with me, I had to wait a significant amount of time before any staff acknowledged I was there. Once a man acknowledged me, I told him I was waiting for a table. This man said he would clean a table for me, so I waited patiently... A lady came to clean the table with a cloth and at the very moment, two ladies arrived, whereupon the female server told me that she had to give the table to the ladies who just arrived, and repelled me to a stool after I got ditched by a friend and had to wait an unexcusable amount of time. I decided to take my money to a more welcoming environment.  You would think that a vegan venue would be more considerate since there is an expectation of a higher moral standard."}
{"text":"To start, Bloomer's has a very sentimental place in the hearts of my partner and I because we went there on our first date.  He had been raving about their donuts for weeks, when we were still just \"Friends\"... he said i had to try one!  He even sent me a picture of the blueberry donut in a cute little box sitting on the grass at Christie Pits park.  He told me he found the little box a little embarrassing to carry around in public, but the tasty donut was worth the embarrassment.  

Aside from love and donuts, Bloomer's has a variety of other baked goods including fresh made muffins, brownies (tasty!), and cakes!  Haven't tried them all, but sign me up for anything with a bit of icing on it.  I'm a sugar tooth.

We usually come here for the donuts and get one flavour each.  Make sure you don't come too late in the day cuz the dodos will be all gone.  In all honesty, I was never a fan of donuts.  I actively disliked them and thought they were kind of nasty and too dense but the Bloomer's donuts have really opening my eyes (or mouth, haha) to this great sweet snack!  My favourite is the wild blueberry, my partner likes the lemon but also the blueberry, too.

They have free water, like every establishment should.  It come out of a little canteen spout thing.  I must say, it comes out way too slow!  Fix this please!  Sometimes you need a drink of water, and you need it quick!  Great water, though. 10/10

Now, for the staff... They are quick to help us get our donuts which is all that really matters!  There is a rather pleasant lady who actually makes the donuts, she is so kind and about 5 foot 5 (in height).  There is a guy who usually works the counter, too.  He is nice and will crack a joke or two.  One time I saw him jump over a cardboard box, way to keep us guessing!

Now, for the decor... They have 3 nice booths for sittin'.  The table is kind of far away from the actual booth where you sit, making laptop times a bit awkward.  There are also arrangements of photos on the walls that are a not cohesive and seem a little far-fetched-forced-hipster chic vibes.  We like making fun of them sometimes.  

The bathrooms, there are two, are very spacious and gracious!  10/10, never had a bathroom that big in my life.

Sandwiches could definitely be a dollar cheaper for what you get.  Don't make it so hard to be vegan, guys. (jokes). It's not that hard if you substitute meat with other protein. 

I remember the first day that Bloomer's opened. I thought to myself, \"jeez not another dumb vegan hub\", but this venture has surprised me and continues to WOW me with their vegan fare and guilt-free treats. The clientele seems to be university educated for the most part, with the exception of a few college graduates trying out vegan food for the first and last time. Overall, the clientele makes for some decent to good people watching as i sip my soy cappuccino and indulge in my graciously topped, flax filled dream of a morning donut.

Thanks Bloomers for letting our love bloom."}
{"text":"after living right around the corner from here a few years ago i'm absolutely kicking myself now for not going here sooner.

I'm not vegan- but I do eat mostly vegan due to some allergies and wow this place might be my new spot. I got the mac n' cheese and of course added the fake bacon- because why wouldn't you!

My friend got the poutine and added the jackfruit and at first I was kinda confused about how good that would taste, but let me tell you- it's good, like super good. 

Best of all- they have the most amazing looking donughts and I know I have to go back real soon for one of those! 

Super great service and great food makes this place my new fav 5 star joint."}
{"text":"One of my FAV vegan spots in the city. They need more breakfast/brunch options, but honestly I could eat their jackfruit sandwich for any meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already and have tried a few things. My favourite is definitely the other bowl as it's really tasty and the price you pay for the portion is worth it. The pulled jackfruit burger is another good one. Before having that burger, I had never ate jackfruit so I was a little unsure but glad I took the risk! On my most recent visit, I got the tempeh reuben sandwich and was disappointed. It was quite greasy, the tempeh tasted like nothing and the pickles in the sandwich were overwhelming. Definitely something I would not order again. One thing I wish at Bloomers is for burgers/sandwiches to come with a side of fries/salad. I mean, for the price, it's not exactly worth it. Anyways, I will be back for the other bowl sometime."}
{"text":"I have never been a big donut fan, but bloomers donuts make me reconsider. The blueberry and pistachio rose ones are amazing - better than their conventional counterparts. Light, fluffy and full of flavour - I keep craving them. My next try will be the boston creme one, which I hear great things about (I'm excited!)."}
{"text":"This is legitimately the best cafe in the neighbourhood. Easily my new fave for sure. The people who work here are so friendly and polite they make you feel like your having  cup of coffee at gone because it's so comfy and cozy. I have to give a shout out to their zucchini Choco chip muffin-YUM. And why was this the first time I've had it? I'm addicted. Americano great flavour and was just the ticket after work and needing that caffeine fix to function."}
{"text":"All i've experienced here is the donuts and i have to say Bloomers hands down makes the best vegan donuts in Toronto, light fluffy and almost impossible to differentiate between the non and vegan varieties, they are that good. Now to be fair my only other experience i've had with vegan donuts is with another Toronto vegan food shop called \"through being cool\" (i know terrible hipster name, but that's what hipsters do lol) , the difference between the 2 shops donuts is vast, as TBC's donuts are so incredibly dense that they verge on being undercooked. they are heavy and drop like a rock into your stomach. They are nothing like the perfect donuts that Bloomer's produces. So if you are looking for amazing vegan donuts, this is the place.

Update:

I finally popped in here and it was an interesting experience, I had the pulled jackfruit bbq sandwich and it was really delicious! The bun was fresh and it was topped with some tasty slaw and a fresh made onion ring, very messy, very good, I'd definitely get it again. Being a bit of a coffee snob, I found their drip basket coffee really good, whatever beans they use, they are very fresh. My only complaint is that the service was kinda strange, the servers were nice, but it seemed like half help yourself, half table service, they served me coffee at the table but I had to take my mug over to the counter to use the sugar and cream substitute. They also took quite long to serve us after we ordered, but at least the food was hot. Over a Link would return, but temper your expectations as far as table service goes."}
{"text":"Was walking several down Bloor, STARVING, but didn't see a place that looked appetizing. Actually passed Bloomer's thinking it was just a cafe. But luckily I turned around, saw that they served lunch, and decided to give it a try. Only til I sat down did I realize it was a vegan spot, which made me hesitant at first, but since I'm making an attempt to be more healthy, I figured why not. Almost went for a sandwich but decided that one of the \"bowls\" was more my speed. I picked the \"Other Bowl\" which had brown rice, steamed greens, purple cabbage slaw, avo, sweet potato, dried cranberries, marinated grilled tofu, mixed seeds, and tahini dressing (which I took on the side). I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was! The ingredients were kinda separated (as opposed to everything being mixed up, which was great cause it allowed me to try out different combinations. The cabbage slaw was tasty, the greens were clean, and the sweet potato was a nice touch. I could eat that dish often. Also had the ice tea of the day which was a ginger blend. Not too sweet, just right. The service was great, the atmosphere was chill, and I definitely hope to pass through next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came to Bloomers with my friends and the food was delicious. All of the food is Vegan (lactose free) and they offer lots of gluten free options.

I was there with a group of 12 people and I found it was difficult for them to manage such a large group. They ended up being sold out of a lot of items and they forgot an order. We then had to ask them to redo it. I felt really bad for my friend who had to wait over an hour for her food. Once her dish arrived, she said it was fantastic.

I would definitely go back but I would only go with 2-4 people to avoid the delay of trying to push together tons of tables and waiting on food they forgot to prepare in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Overall their food is pretty good. It's a great option to come solo, with a friend or even a couple of people. Menu offerings for everyone (as long as you're happy with vegan) from brunch, dinner and snacks. 

The one downside of this place in my opinion is their coffee. Their brewed coffee is not good. I find it weak and lacks quality. Of course that is only my opinion but I highly recommend they change their supplier, or offer another blend for those that want something richer."}
{"text":"The pulled jacked burger I really enjoyed. The jacked fruit was cooked to a similar texture and flavor to meat. The maple and pecan donut was too sweet for me. The butter tart was just pecans, sugar, and maple syrup- again too sweet for me. The ginger tea was soothing. The service was nice."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered four donuts.. Mocha, blueberry, Boston cream and rose pistachio. Great textures and unique, long lingering flavour profile. I did not enjoy the  rose pistachio but do thing it is a must have! You won't find that flavour anywhere else. The service was nothing spectacular... Or very friendly but i wasn't offended by it either. I think they were just very busy."}
{"text":"This place is just so good! I love the atmosphere and most importantly the food! I'm a long time vegan but have taken so many omni friends here and they absolutely love it. The baked goods are top notch, bagels are unbeatable, the bowls are filling and healthy, the sandwiches super satisfying. I think what I like most is that you can have a really tasty lunch or dinner/drinks date here or get a coffee and donut and read all by yourself. Keep it up, Bloomer's!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the donuts. The sandwiches and healthy bowls are good too, but who are we kidding, the donuts are ridiculously good. The rose pistachio is everything but it's like, always sold out. There's no dairy in anything incl the espresso drinks which would usually turn me off but it just works there. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"Bloomer's used to be our favourite neighbourhood place for lunch (I love the mac & cheese), and I wrote an enthusiastically positive review when it first opened. Sadly, standards have slipped noticeably. On our most recent visit, service was non-existent; the place was nearly empty, yet we waited and waited just for a menu. Finally we got up and fetched our own menus and placed our orders at the counter. Strike one. Strike two: the glare coming through the front window was so harsh, the lighting so unpleasant, that I could hardly read the menu, even with sunglasses. Any light-filtering blinds would easily solve the problem, but the front window remains bare and the atmosphere in the restaurant is neither pleasant nor restful. (To make matters worse, the music being played was atrocious. Even if you're a fan of heavy metal, which I'm not, is this appropriate music for a relaxing mid-day break?) Strike three: for the first time, the mac & cheese was dried-out and badly overcooked. It's so sad when your favourite place goes downhill like this. We won't be going back to Bloomer's."}
{"text":"I had the chocolate chip cookie here. It did not meet my expectations but it did have chocolate chips which helped the flavour. I could not really taste the cookie part except for the cookie consistency which was a bit moist and chewy. I have had their cookie and brownie at the vegan fest last year and it was much better."}
{"text":"I finally was able to drop by today for the first time. I got the sandwich and soup lunch special and it is the best meal I have had in a long time! I had the Reuben sandwich which was HUGE, and full of flavour! If you love the pickle/vinegar flavour and mustard then this is for you! It is served on a toasted made in house bread that was just to die for! And the \"meat\" was very delicious!

The soup of the day was a pumpkin and apple purée. They serve it in a coffee cup for to go orders which was super convenient since I could drink it on route to my next location without worrying about making a mess or needing a spoon.

I also bought their chocolate chip cookie to try. It's chewy and vegan tasting ( don't expect it to be the best chocolate chip cookie you ever had). 

Overall this is definitely a place I will go back to for my lunches whenever I am in the neighbourhood! The menu and pastry selection all sounds delicious and I am dying to try more!"}
{"text":"Ive only ever ordered from Uber eats but I have yet to be disappointed with the food! DEEELISH."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. I generally go for either the seitan reuben or the tofu BLT, both very tasty. The pulled jack is also great, although a bit intense so I got slightly tired of it after a few times. Also get the french fries, they are thin, crispy, flavorful, delicious.

The muffins here are truly amazing. Some of the best muffins I've ever had, vegan or not. Although, they are more of the moist cakey variety as opposed to those muffins with a huge top that have a texture similar to banana bread.

The vegan carrot cake needs some work, sadly. I'm not a huge fan of their vegan cream cheese frosting. The butter tarts are tasty, but definitely not as good as the original non-vegan version. In particular, the filling is a bit too runny.

I found the service is a bit slow at times, perhaps simply because it gets really busy."}
{"text":"In the department of Reasons Why I Love Bloorcourt, Bloomer's Bakery opened their doors in late July and have been open every day since except the holiday Monday. 

Naturally, I have been gorging myself on Boston cream donuts, dream cookies (empire cookies), blueberry muffins, cupcakes, butter tarts, fresh made bagels with cream cheese, and carrot cake. Did I mention everything is vegan and some things are gluten-free?

It's a soft opening, because they are just sticking to baked goods and drinks at the moment, but they plan to roll out a sandwich menu come fall and offer soup and other nice, simple items like cake by the slice that for some reason aren't common at the other vegan spots around here. 

The space used to be an Ethiopian restaurant whose sign advertised \"Organic vegetarian sandwiches\" but they always seemed to be out of these and the only time I tried the Ethiopian food, the veggies were under cooked. 

The space has been painted blue, booths added and a bar across the window. I love their large wheat stalk logo. The place is adorable and right now with the nice summer weather, sitting at the window bar with garage door open is the perfect place to people watch on this colourful stretch of Bloor while enjoying an iced Americano and a donut.

I'm so glad that the owners, a friendly couple from Winnipeg, chose this neighbourhood for their business and not, say, The Beaches or Leslieville. My dream is to see them become a Sweetpea's (Portland's greatest vegan bakery) of the east offering a new soup daily, satisfying sandwiches, a variety of dairy-free schmears with their bagels along side some of the best vegan baked goods around!

TLDR: Get a Boston cream or dream cookies and iced Americano and park yourself at the window bar on the nice day."}
{"text":"If you like your donuts big, a little bread-y, with a kiss of grease then you need to try the ones from here. I got the Boston cream donut, which had a sweet but light filling, not quite custardy but more like a buttercream. I only wish my donut had more of it. If you're taking your donut to go, expect any frosting on top to smear onto the paper bag. No fear, you can always dip your donut back into it. 

I didn't have the chance to try anything else from here, but the donut was pretty solid and I'd come back to try other donuts or food (but donuts first)."}
{"text":"$15 Cobb salad with half rotting greens each time I've ever had it.... I really like the place but as someone who cooks for a living, it's truly lazy to not pick through your greens before serving them.. you wouldn't eat rotting spinach at home so why am I paying for it?
Also the consistency is always off... one dish will not be the same the next time you get it. 
The cookies are awesome, as are the cupcakes but the bagels are prrrreeeetty awful. Unless you enjoy trying to digest a brick."}
{"text":"I came here thinking i'd try the jackfruit pulled sandwich, however I ended up trying the \"Other\" bowl. The server recommended it so I thought i'd take her advice. It ended up being one of the tastiest things!! So flavourful and healthy too but it didn't feel like I was eating something healthy or bland at all. I really enjoyed it and it was huge portions. Afterward I tried a cookie and cupcake. Both were amazing! They ran out of donuts but i'll have to try one next time."}
{"text":"This place is straight up my favourite spot in the whole god damned city of Toronto."}
{"text":"I am upgrading my rating to 5star.  I love their donuts, they are the best. Even non vegans like them better than other high end donut shops. The carrot cake, brownies and almond butter cups are fantastic too. I have had a few meals and food is great. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Legitimately impressed in these vegan baked goods, and that's as a guy who doesn't actually care if things are vegan.

I picked up a bunch of donuts, muffins, and other snacks to impress vegan clients and I'll say that everything I sampled was delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the rosewater donut but others liked it so it's obviously a subjective flavour and not a fault of the donut itself.

They were decent sized items too as we were able to cut them up to share and sample.
Recommended!"}
{"text":"Very small servings and limited space. Everyone can hear your conversation as you speak."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Excuse my excitement as I explain why this place is so awesome. 
This little hidden gem close to Ossington is to die for. I promise you. Everything on the menus is vegan, fresh and made with love. The salads are packed with so much goodness and flavour. It's mouth watering. I wish I could eat this clean every day. Definitely my favourite spot to grab a quick bit that fills me up and also makes me feel good.
I ordered the soup of the day and pulled jackfruit."}
{"text":"Don't come here on a Wednesday.

I've been to this place many times (usually part of my Tuesday routine) and the food and service has always been amazing. The past two Wednesdays I felt like I was in a different restaurant. The food was subpar; forgotten items and burnt onion rings and the service was just plain rude. It breaks my heart to say this because this place has been excellent in the past."}
{"text":"I love finding new cafe places, so this one is definitely one I'd come back to...on a weekday. I'm not a huge fan of extremely busy coffee shops where it's difficult to even hear the other person you're with sometimes. Plus we had to move some seats to help a bigger group find seating.

But with that being said. The service was very good and quick. Plus, we had a Canadian Maple Cream donut to share....which was definitely the best tasting donut I have had in a very long time. I would definitely check this place out when it's not super  busy."}
{"text":"Friends!!! Do not run from a vegan bakery, especially not when it's Bloomer's. 
I had no clue that this place was vegan, let alone offered a nice variety of gluten-free options (I thought \"Bloomer's\" = wheat blooming, and being celiac, gluten is my kryptonite). The vegan/gluten-free zucchini chocolate chip muffin I shovelled into my face this morning was AMAZING! It had all the flavour and moisture that all gluten-enduring human cherish in a good muffin, and didn't taste like sawdust or applesauce like most gluten-free stuff out there. 
I also love that they only offer organic almond or soy milk for your beverages, the 'Silk' stuff that most places use is full of gross additives and preservatives, but this thoughtful touch shows how much tasty, wholesome goodness goes into everything they make.
I saw that they use tofutti cream cheese for their bagels, my only complaint would be that there wasn't a gluten-free bagel to go with it but I see their working on a lunch menu and I've got high hopes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE BLOOMERS! 

Best bottomless coffee in town for less than $3, vegan muffins to die for, delicious bagels with vegan cream cheese you won't even care is vegan if you're not. Chillest vibe, super creative awesome space, tempeh 'wings', incredible soups on the daily. Just love it. love love love."}
{"text":"Surprisingly OK donuts! The donuts here are NOT gluten-free, so they are better than I would expect from a vegan bakery. The dough is very raised, hyper firm and  spongy - texture very much like an overstuffed pillow! It has a nice flavor though, and the options aren't bad.  We sampled the vanilla sprinkle, cinnamon sugar, and mocha chocolate varieties - all very edible. (You can tell how low my expectations are for vegan baked goods, haha.) I took these to a party with some healthy people and there was nothing left - lots of competition for the last bites of donuts, gluten-free carrot cake, and gluten-free cookies. I'd recommend Bloomers to the gluten-free crowd, and those that prefer denser donuts."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place because a nearby coffee shop was full. I was surprised when I tried to order a cappuccino with 2% milk, the staff said it was a vegan place and that they only had soy or almond milk. I was surprised because this is the first vegan only place that I've been too! I got a chocolate cookie that tasted amazing for vegan food! 

The seats was nice and comfy. They had outlets everywhere for you to charge a laptop or phone. The cost was fair for vegan baked goods. 

I had two issues. First, when the front door opened, the draft from the outside came in. I had to keep my jacket on because of it. It would be good if they had a curtain to cover the entrance to limit the draft. Second, they close at 6pm on Fridays. Would be cool if they were open until later. 

I will come back to try their vegan meals!"}
{"text":"The best vegan food I've had so far! I love that they're not just about the salads and bowls (although they have those too) and there's everything from poutine to mac & cheese - all the classic comfort foods. Location is very convenient as it's right outside Ossington station, but as others have mentioned, service is quite slow for take-out. I didn't really mind though since I wasn't in a hurry anyway and the great food made up for the wait.

I got the tempeh reuben and a rosewater pistachio doughnut to go. Both were delicious and exceeded my expectations. The reuben was surprisingly flavourful and honestly unlike anything I've eaten before; the tempeh was perfectly marinated and super satisfying - didn't miss the meat at all! It was my second time trying a vegan doughnut and I am happy to say that this one was much better (almost on par with the rosewater pistachio at Glory Hole Doughnuts). My only complaint is that there was a little too much of the sauerkraut and pickles on the reuben, which made it quite sour near the end. Not a huge deal though, I'd still be down to go back and try the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I love their donuts. They are huge and delicious. I haven't tried anything else but it all looks fabulous."}
{"text":"The freshly baked blueberry muffin I purchased had a lovely spongy texture, unfortunatly it was so sweet it was more like a piece of cake then a muffin. 
There is plenty of seating, however I wouldn't recommend going there in the morning to sit and study. The music played resembled tunes better suited to a night club, and the table I sat at was uneven an rickety."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place! First time ever that I've been somewhere that doesn't serve cow's milk - YAAY - and you're not just restricted to soy - no sirree! Rice, almond and coconut milk options! Delish doughnut - just the perfect consistancy! Had the \"chicken wing\" sandwich - oh my god - tempeh? Cauliflower? Who cares! It was great!
My only pet peeve is that each of the (roomy, seats 4 or 6 people) booths there had one person, with a laptop/papers spread out, while a group of us was squished, touching the the other table next to us. Would I be complaining if I was there and had a booth all to myself? Probably not. Also LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that all of the ingredients are listed right in the pastry case. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Bloomers has a great vibe, really wonderful owners, decent coffee and very tasty baked goods. Pleasantly surprised when it first opened, Bloomers has become a major go to for a quick breakfast in the morning."}
{"text":"Excellent place. I often meet my sister here to catch up and then do some work - and the environment is perfect for both. Haven't eaten full meals here yet, but the vegan cream cheese bagel was damn delicious (and this is coming from a non-vegan who loves her cream cheese bagels). A good place to bring someone who is nervous about vegan food!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when a new bakery opened up in the area (I'm obsessed with baked goods, what can I say?) and once I tried their bread pudding and donuts, I was hooked! Since then,  I've tried most of their baked goods and I have yet to try anything even remotely disappointing. I was hesitant to try their lunch items because I'm not a vegan and have had some \"blah\" vegan food in the past but their BBQ tempeh sandwich was very satisfying. I recommend any of their pastries and the roasted almond latte is amazing!"}
{"text":"It would be nice if I could review their food, but I can't and I'll tell you why.

They pretty much ignored me on two separate occassions when I asked about accessibility. I had to literally keep asking for information on IG and Twitter. This last time it took over FOUR days and repeated questions to get a simple answer while they retweeted other people. 

It should not be this hard to get a business to tell you the information that you requested. By having me ask repeatedly, they made me feel like I was being a hassle. This is NO way to run a business and I'll never go there, ever. I'll happily go to other places that are accomodating and helpful both online and offline. 

BTW, their bathrooms are not fully wheelchair accessible. There are no grab bars and the space is likely too small for motorized mobility equipment to turn (i.e., power chair or scooter)."}
{"text":"I was there for an event so didn't get to try the food, but the huge (vegan) chocolate dip donut I had was delicious, as well as the roasted almond tea that was recommended to go with it. The server was a peach, and the whole place was clean and pleasant. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. They are just starting to expand their menu to offer more lunch and dinner options. So far I have tried both the reuben sandwhich and the \"other bowl\" which were both delicious. They offer gluten free bread (huge plus in my books!) and have the yummiest baked good to grab and go.. Don't be fooled by the GF (gluten free) symbol - you'd never know it!!! Like others have said already, those zuccini muffins are heaven."}
{"text":"The best food items are the sandwiches and burgers. The salads are mostly just the mixed greens and the dressing selections don't really fit well with the cranberry and sweet potato salad toppings. The tempeh rebeun, and pulled jack fruit are the best items.  Seitan veggie burger is decent. 

Service is really slow and the restaurant is cold during cooler weather because the main door opens directly to the street without a buffer. Not many seats and people hang out on laptops. 

I will come back to eat the food but I wish the service was speedier. The restaurant is seat yourself and it took about 15 minutes for server to come to our table with menus, then another 15 minutes for then to come back with water and take our orders."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan food. Baked goods, sandwiches, soups, etc...

Also great drink menu so great to unwind after work."}
{"text":"We got the burger after asking the server if it was big enough to share between two people (because we werent that hungry and had had a big breakfast, also it was expensive) and he said yes, definitely. We get the burger and it is seriously the smallest burger i have seen. It also doesn't have much inside it, its very plain, not especially flavourful or anything. Paid $14. Walked out hungry. Dont think i will visit again."}
{"text":"Met a business contact at this place for coffee. It was a midday meet but strangely this place was very busy. Can't really comment on anything beyond the coffee...it was decent."}
{"text":"This review is purely donut based.  I've been going to Bloomer's for the past while only to get a donut to go.  The donuts are astounding.  The donuts are the reason I wake up in the morning.  My only complaint is that sometimes they are not open when I go.  This means I am without a donut for the day.  This thought makes me sad."}
{"text":"Bloomer's is probably the only vegan restaurant I've ever been to that manages to stock a varied and balanced menu.  Rather than leaning into one trend or another, the offerings here cater to a vast variety of consumers, from casual morning coffee addicts to health nuts to people who walked 30 minutes to meet a friend here and just really want a greasy sandwich.  Most vegan spots have a trendy air of pretension, but Bloomer's just feels like a restaurant.

I had the pulled jack sandwich, something of a play on pulled pork, and it was fantastic.  And fantastically gigantic.  I was initially a bit disappointed that the sandwiches here don't come with chips, but after eating about half of one, I was in pain.  Having never tried jackfruit as a protein substitute before, I was a bit apprehensive about how it would taste, but it ended up being just like all other things when smothered in barbecue sauce: effing delicious.  Pulled pork has never piqued my interest, but I would walk 30 minutes every day for this sandwich.

Also sampled: the poutine (great fries, great gravy, meh cheese substitute), maple walnut donut (oh god so good), elderberry hibiscus iced tea (tasty but super sweet).  Service was very polite and efficient, but food itself took a while to come out.  I really like this neighborhood - it reminds me of Connecticut Street in my dear Buffalo.  I would absolutely return here!"}
{"text":"Over the weekend, my pal and I had every intention of having a work date together. But rather than working, we ended up here and had a huge vegan feast. 

I have never been to Bloomer's before, but have heard nothing but incredible things about their doughnuts. So I knew I had to order one. My friend also told me their onion rings were the best in the city, but apparently, they have taken them off the menu. So that was also a write-off. 

The vibe of the place is cozy and casual. It gets super busy on a Saturday afternoon. The service was a bit slow at times, given how busy it was. But that was okay because my friend and I were catching up. I ended up ordering the \"Other\" bowl  ($14) with tofu (additional $2) which was delicious and was topped with greens, cabbage slaw, sweet potato, black beans, cranberries and tahini dressing. My pal gave me a bit of her pulled jack sandwich and it was incredible. Literally tasted like pulled pork.

They serve Reunion Island Coffee in-house and it is tasty as heck. Just keep in mind, they don't serve dairy milk. Oh, and their tea menu looked pretty great as well. 

Btw, their doughnuts are totally worth the hype. I'm not a person who is into sweets and I was shocked. So chewy and soft and delightful. I'm craving another one, tbh."}
{"text":"Had it to go. The cookie cracked.

Chocolate chip cookie 8/10
Like the texture: crispy at the edge and chewy in the middle, but too sweet for me.

Brownie 8/10
It's overall cakey, a little bit gooey at the middle. The taste was rich with the chocolate batter and bunch of chocolate chips. And there was a sprinkle of salt to balance the sweetness. The first few bites were delightful, but it's a little bit too oily (I guess they need the oil to keep it moist) that I couldn't finish the entire thing.

Rose water pistachio donut 9.5/10
Love it. The dough was chewy, light and moist. A little bit greasy. Not too sweet. The best part is the donut will make your finger smell like roses if you eat it with hand!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Not worth the 1/2 hr wait for food or the 15 minute wait to pay the bill. If you have some time on your hands, go visit. If you have kids with you, forget about it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from hurrier to try out this restaurant for the first time. And while the delivery was exactly on time, the food was sadly not great. I really wanted to love this place and have a new vegetarian spot to order from, but I'll never order again. I got a salad, French fries and the batteries tempeh. The salad was strangely already mixed with the dressing which made all the leaves entirely wilted, wet and lukewarm. I get take out salads all the time and normally the dressing is kept separate for this reason. The fries are overcooked, totally cold. The tempeh is alright, also cold but not bad in terms of texture. I still tipped as always, but apart from the tempeh, nothing is edible."}
{"text":"This place is a 2.5 start at best.  Have been back a few times since they first opened and have expanded their menu. 

The service here is not very good and their ceaser salad is horrible. Like you have to return it horrible. What vegan wants a sour vinegar based ceaser salad. I want creamy garlicy goodness.!!!   The description on the menu should be more clear so as to not disappoint people or should be removed from the menu. Their kimchi fries are also really weird as in addition to the kimchi they also add a bunch of seaweed, which doesn't really belong.  They also use canned jackfruit in their sandwiches which is disappointing as fresh is just so much better.

It's very mediocre food with bad service. There is no reason to go here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan spots to hit when I'm downtown. Great music, rustic worn in feel, and always a great section of gf/v bake goods."}
{"text":"I love to support businesses with heart. When you get to eat a delicious cupcake AND contribute to someone's labour of love all in one swift motion? I mean, come on. Owners Kelly and Alex are pretty sweet, and it's so clear that Bloomer's is their baby.

It's a cozy lounge spot with booths and mismatched 2-seaters. Every day seems to have something new in the baked goods department- caramel glazed donut pudding, coconut donut holes, fresh bread, bagels, muffin and cupcake galore... the opportunities are vast. Staples are the un-butter tart and boston creme donut. Damn.

GREAT tea selection served in the CUTEST assortment of antique dishes. Chill vibes to work away on my laptop or just zone out + watch the stragglers from Monica's Bar (down the street) stumble by through the space's big garage-door window.

Stoked for Bloomers to extend their hours- they'll be serving drinks and a full dinner menu soon. Sidenote: excellent music tastes for your optimum atmospheric experience."}
{"text":"Such a cozy place. Amazing drinks kind staff and INCREDIBLE baked goods! Really great prices tops it all off. Definitely will be spending quite  a bit of time here. :)"}
{"text":"Very cute bakery. It was filled with people and the baked goods and dinner items looked great. I got the zuchinni chocolate chip muffin which is actually delicious! Definitely a great week day place to hang out and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan café/restaurant for casual fare. The baked goods are great, as is the coffee and tea. The atmosphere is charming. It's a good place for any time of day, whether it's lunch (sometimes breakfast), studying café-style, or a quick dinner. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfect doughnut! Easily the best everything bagel I've had. You can taste how fresh everything is and made in house. Strongly recommend if you want a chill vegan spot with some quick bites for breakfast. Service was super friendly and place was clean and very laid back."}
{"text":"Its been over a week since I finally tried the donuts at Bloomer's and I am still dreaming about them. 

So sweet, so perfectly chewy and soft, so satisfying. You would never know they were vegan and isn't that just the sweetest thing of all? All the indulgence without any of the guilt over what it took to get in your belly. 

My only regret is writing this review because now I'm thinking about them again and its after 9 PM on a Tuesday and Bloomer's isn't open."}
{"text":"The donuts are pretty good, but other things that I've had have been hit or miss. Probably the best vegan donuts that I've had in Toronto, and the worst mac and cheese.

Service is OK for this type of casual place."}
{"text":"I wasn't impessed with this place. 
From the second i walked in, I felt pretty unwelcome. No one greets you, and they didn't even bother to place some water on the table or ask if I wanted a drink. I had the seitan+black bean burger. The most advertised item on their Instagram, but it wasn't even visible on their menu so I had to ask for it. When I went up to pay, it took a pretty long time for them to notice me and it came out to 18 bucks for a burger with a side of fries. I don't think I've ever paid that much for a veggie burger.. ever. 
I don't think i'll be going back."}
{"text":"While out for a Saturday walk on a cool fall day we stopped in to try one of their donuts. The place is located on the south side of Bloor Street and features a selection of small tables on one side and a bar with a dessert case on the other. We walked in and waited simply to be served. While the place was busy with a younger, hip vegan crowd, no one made an effort to engage with us at all, until finally someone who was sitting at the counter like a customer decided to take our order. Needless to say we weren't impressed with the lax attitude towards customer service. We ordered one donut to go and were surprised not only at the cost but also how sweet it was. Too often vegan places over sweeten their desserts and Bloomer's is no exception. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Best vegan cafe I've been to so far :)

Their curried cauliflower soup was so creamy and the flavour and temperature was perfection. 

I tried what my friends ordered:\"The other bowl\" and the \"Tempeh Reuben sandwich\"
The bowl was a very lightly seasoned and filling. Loved the sandwich! I'll definitely be ordering that next time.

Felt so warm and cozy here both food and the atmosphere. Also relieved to know that there's no dairy used as I'm lactose intolerant. 

I wonder if I can buy their roasted almond tea in bulks 'cause I'm about to become obsessed!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan bakery in Toronto! 

Their donuts are perfect. Fluffy freshness all around. My favorite flavors are, Boston cream, cookies and cream, pumpkin, apple cider, chocolate raspberry truffle, and the berry. Ok, pretty much all the donuts I've tried are my favorites. 

I recently ordered a pecan pie from them and it was the best pie (vegan and non-vegan) I've had. Just the right amount of filling and the crust was \"buttery\" Crisp. Even the non-vegans were impressed. Which is annoying, as if they never had bad tasting non-vegan food. PUHLEASE! 

Mind you, I ordered the pie with gluten. Just because I'm vegan doesn't mean I'm gluten free, but they did have gluten free pies available for you celiac intolerants. 

Someday I will eventually try their meals, but with all those donuts, I tend to make them my meal replacement. :X"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good stuff about this place. I've visited a half dozen times in the last couple of months, and each time I've come away extremely happy. The food's consistently been great, the two people who run the shop are kind and personable, and I've been very impressed both by the restaurant's dedication to ensuring that they serve only animal-free foods and by their openness about their ingredients and sourcing.

I've tried a bunch of stuff on the menu: the roasted cauliflower soup, the bagel and cream cheese, the reuben, the club sandwich, the portobello-kimchi burger, the butter tart, and a bunch of other little baked goods and treats. I've not found a dud in the bunch. The portobello-kimchi burger is absolutely phenomenal--perhaps the best sandwich in all of Toronto. The bagel is certainly the best bagel in the city. And the butter tart (which I tried today for the first time) knocked my socks off with just how tender and decadent and gooey it was.

I've only had one less-than-ideal eating moment at Bloomer's. I've gotten the club sandwich a number of times, and I've generally loved it. But the most recent time I ordered it, I found the tempeh to be a bit too hard and dry. The texture would've worked well if the slices were a bit thinner, but because the pieces were quite thick I found them a bit too difficult to bite through. This is a small complaint, though, and I am mentioning it mostly to emphasize just how fantastic my experiences have generally been.

I've heard rumblings that Bloomer's will be opening later and eventually (hopefully!) staying open as a bar into the late night. That would be a huge, huge win for Toronto's vegan community.

If you've not checked out Bloomer's, you should make a point of giving it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Things I like: Almond milk lattes, the muffins and the beet burger. Things I am not crazy about: the rocky tables, the uncomfortable vintage chairs, the way the bagels are hidden from the world and the music. 
I will comeback for a crazy giant doughnut but I will get it to go. It's really not inviting there. 
Warning: don't get the Ceasar salad it's so oily."}
{"text":"A great local spot. Delicious baked treats with plenty of tea and coffee selection. Full menu options for lunch and dinner. I've been here a few times and I love the cafe vibe. It's also licensed. Beer and a donut? Don't mind if I do. 

Seriously chill environment to enjoy a beverage and some nibbles. Great to linger, chat, play a board game or get some work done! 

The baked goods are unreal though. I had the hibiscus donut and it was perf"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a sweet baked treat on my way home from work on a frosty evening. (Recently diagnosed with celiac, I'm still in the mourning stages of all the baked things you could want steps from wherever you're standing in this city.) So I happened upon Bloomer's and was offered lovely looking muffins and cookies, but my decision was made for me when I learned that the miniature carrot cake in the display case was safe for me to eat. (This is what I miss most right now from my wheat-eating days, strangely.) No joke, this was easily the tastiest carrot cake I've ever had, and I've had (and baked) a great many. The people there were also wonderful, super nice, even though it was almost closing time. Give it a whirl, whether or not you're a vegan or have issues with gluten, it's that good."}
{"text":"OMG I had to review right away. Like others,  I didn't realise this was a vegan/gf bakery until I read previous comments. 

Firstly it was immaculately clean - unlike other bakeries that have flies swarming over the food. There were ingredients listed in front of everything, which is basically my dream - as a person with peanut and fish allergies. I was excited just about the listed ingredients alone - most places I have to ask, the server seems inconvenienced, and they often just tell me that I shouldn't eat anything. 

The server/cashier (who was a total babe by the way) made a recommendation of the lemon donut. 

It was hands down the BEST donut I have ever eaten. Super fresh, nice and soft but also chewy. The glaze was perfectly done - not too sweet or too tangy. It was like pillowy lemony goodness. Yuuuuum. I will be back for sure!!"}
