{"text":"You decided to kick out customers because a  \"regular\" didn't like them on top of that that regular sexually violated my best friend and when she informed the bartender the bartender excuse the regulars behavior needless to say this is a disgusting horrible establishment."}
{"text":"Patty, Carol and Windy are awesome bartenders-friendly and make awesome drinks!"}
{"text":"The building itself wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Had the Bubba burger with cheese curds and fries. Food was ok. Meh. Not noteworthy. Beer was not ok. Tasted like the lines hadn't been cleaned in an age. Looking around at the regulars after that,  noticed they were drinking bottled beer or mixed drinks..."}
{"text":"Been here several times...first thing you notice are the bars on the doors, like it used to be a check cashing place or pawn shop. My beer tasted skunky, so I always order bottles at this place. Bartenders were friendly, crowd was older at 5 pm Friday, last time I was there. Looks like a log cabin inside. I'd go back to this dive bar if asked, but would never ask others to go with me ...."}
{"text":"Madison dive bar for sure.  Drinks are reasonably priced. The bar is large so you are never crowded in. They have some pool tables and a dart machine. Some slots and pull tabs. The bathrooms are acceptable.  The crowd leans toward bikerish which is fine. The bartender makes good drinks and she was nice.  I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"It has pool and darts and decent localized music but the costumer service is ~awful~ I called and checked if they where open the bartender replied, \"I answered didn't I?\" And hung up. When we eventually got to the bar she was inconsiderate and was only focused on the old men she could target to serve and stuff $1 down her bra. Otherwise she couldn't care less about new patrons. If you just want to play pool, cool. If you're a female don't go here, this particular bartender is a hater."}
