{"text":"The best Italian food in Vegas.  People are great, price is great.  I visit at least 1x week. I saw a few problems with staff posted, I have had the opposite experience every one was friendly and sociable."}
{"text":"Our family enjoys Sunset Pizzeria very much.  From their pizza to appetizers!  We are a big fan."}
{"text":"Best pizza and chicken fingers! Chicken fingers are the best I've had also they have a secret homemade ranch that's Amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Vegas and Henderson, and here's why!

I love the atmosphere, its small, there's a game playing, there are decks of cards to play while there, the room is open to the kitchen so you can see what's going on, and the staff are all SUPER friendly, there are \"the regulars and the family\" and its like we get to step into their home for a bit!

Okay the food!  Yes its served on china, which is a great touch, but here's the nuts and bolts of why its my fav!  Its a thin crust, not hard like a cracker, and its covered with the best tasting sauce, and freshest toppings, and stringing out cheese!

Honestly my favorite pizza in Vegas and HENDERSON, good pizza my whole family enjoyed!"}
{"text":"First and last time I order pizza from this place. I asked if they had fresh basil for the pizza. They young woman on the phone said they did and  added it to my toppings.  My pizza arrived on time but luke warm if that and no basil on the pizza and hardly any cheese.   I usually and I truly mean that do not complain about bad food or service but as a chef I thought they should know about my frustration.  A young man answered the phone this time and upon asking for a manager I was told that no one was available and that he could help me.  He proceeded to tell me that the basil was in the pizza sauce and had nothing to say about my cold pizza.  I was completely at a loss for words when I hung up the phone.  As a chef for over 20 years now, I know that one upset customer will tell many more people about their bad experiences versus their good.  Hence my decision to write this review.  I will never recommend this pizzeria to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get great pizza been coming here for many years! And if you are a ranch lover like me, you will come back for more of their delicious ranch. It can be a bit pricey depending on what you get but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been eating from sunset pizza for years now and have never disappointed us. This is a wonderfully family owned business who provide the best pizza in town and even better yet they deliver the best pizza in town. Make sure you get extra ranch because it is like no other ranch dressing you have ever tried you. Make sure you say hi to Jodi because she makes the whole place run."}
{"text":"We order from here regularly and they have excellent customer service!  Delicious NY style pizza with the best ranch!"}
{"text":"So  i google sunset pizza, their website comes up, i read their menu, call to order food to go, and discover its \" bait and switch\", prices are Way higher now, kyle says thats not us!!!??? What??!! Website was put up by soneone else he says, we cannot take it down, yeah, duh, grubhub helps business's get going, yes kyle you can take it off!! I literally almost ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken and a tuna melt but when I was quoted $12 had gone up to 16 for the Alfredo and the tuna melted on from $6 to 10 dollars I'm like forget it I will just come in and talk with someone about it of course the cashier was Kyle he kept insisting they can do nothing about it that's b******* of course there was no owner or manager around be careful people what they quote online is not what they really are I will definitely never be going back Angelina's Pizza in Seven Hills did the same thing last summer ordered $50 of food and when it came out to be $70 they said oh we haven't updated our menu get a clue Sunset Pizza what you're doing is it illegal"}
{"text":"I've tried a few of their New York style pizzas and they've all been delicious. My family and I love their mushrooms and homemade ranch. They have yummy desserts too. We usually dine in and have great service. Prices are fair too. They do have a good take out special too."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza in a cool little hole in the wall pizza joint.  Just the way pizza should be served.

I got the Medium with half mushroom / pepperoni and half cheese for the kids.  From ordering to receiving, it took less than 20 minutes.  We also ordered the mozzarella sticks which I would skip next time as I'm not a fan of the bread crumb type breaking.  I prefer my mozzarella sticks dipped in the batter. 

The pizza though was just like u enjoy.  Nice crispy yet chewy crust, fresh ingredients and not too much grease.  I'm from the east coast so I'm overly picky about my pizza but this place is spot on.  

This is a definite repeat for us on pizza night."}
{"text":"The pizza was definitely 'da bomb'. The service was great and they even had a couple flat screens to watch football. Great New York Pizza and Football. You can't top that!"}
{"text":"We've been customers for several years and this place is fairly priced and the quality remains fresh and consistent. The owners and/or manager are nice and overall staff is generally polite. This place is by far the best little hidden pizza joint around these parts of Henderson.."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in on a whim for some tasty pizza.... damned if we didn't hit a lil jackpot here.... the 2slice special was perfect for us to tryout something new without the entire pie commitment.  The crust was crispy and the topping was quite delicious... usually the sauce is the first thing I notice about eating it, good or bad, this was great. I'm always apprehensive about proprietary tomato sauce recipes or family pass-downs. They always letdown or are bland. These guys nailed it. Although it did seem a lil stuffy in there... we walked in to a table loaded with pizza boxes..... a good spot too.... we were relegated to the back last table..... not what we wanted. Try out the special, try the milk before you buy the cow. 2slices and a soda"}
{"text":"Their pizza is average, maybe slightly above, but they have a good take out special. Their sandwiches are WAY overpriced for what you get. Who doesn't bake their Italian sub??? The only thing warmed was the bun. It was only an 8\" bun and was $9.89! About $3 more than it should've been. In fact most all of their menu items are ridiculously overpriced for the quality. The meats were good and the bun was good, but the dressing was very cheap golden Italian. Won't order a sub here again but would keep getting their pizza."}
{"text":"BEWARE! The sink to wash hands is right next to the cash register. USE IT!  We ordered the Sunset combo pizza and 2 salads at the Tropicana location. The cashier prepared our salads but didn't wash her hands first. We watched her do this twice! I called her on this and asked for a refund on the salads. We figured the pizza was cooked so let it slide. We won't be coming back to any location!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! I am all about toppings on my pizza, but the plain cheese here is by far the best pizza I have ever had. Make sure you order a pint of their ranch to dip it in. Seriously, to die for."}
{"text":"I ordered a sausage park hero and a coke.   Loved the food and service was fine.   My only issue with them was the portion size or the dollar amount paid.  My order cost me over $10.00. And what I got was 2 sausage links on both ends of the hero.   Like I said, I enjoyed it.. I just thought the price could have been cheaper or the portion size bigger.   Other then that I thought it was a good place to try out."}
{"text":"My family and friends have been ordering from this place for over 3 years now and never will again. 

They have a pickup special which is a 16\" Cheese Pizza for $9.99 that is listed on their ad and store window. Two days ago we ordered 2 pickup specials and when I came to pick up the pizzas, I was quoted over $25. I didn't understand why the price was so high until I was told that the limit is 1 per person now. Nowhere on the ad or the store window does it mention a limit of 1 per person. Even after calling in the order for 2 pickup specials, I was not told I was only able to purchase one at $9.99.  

The girl at the desk must have many people questioning this price hike, since she was so quick to point to the menu showing 2 large 1 topping pizzas for $23. So not only was I not told of the price hike over the phone, I was charged for 2 pizzas with 1 topping on each and never given to chance to add the topping."}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza!  The ranch is the BEST around, and the hot fries kick ass!  The Boulder Highway location is better, but Horizon Ridge is awesome too!  Get two Xlarge Cheese pizzas with two pints of ranch...and your weekend food choices are set and set good!"}
{"text":"This place never let's us down. Super fast and delicious. We always order pizza, (9.99 pick-up special) chicken fingers, and antipasti salad. Do not forget to order EXTRA house made ranch!"}
{"text":"My family loves Sunset Pizza! We have lived in this town for almost 24 years and have tried almost every pizzeria in town. Sunset is one is the best. The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I ordered  pizza for our staff today and as usual it was the best pizza we've had. I have not only ordered pizza I have ordered several other items from their menu. Their food is always consistently good. The owner Jodi and Mike are wonderful. They have a very friendly staff. I look forward to my next purchase from them.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I happen to live basically next door so convenience is terrific and the customer service is always perfection. I typically order from here about 2 times a week and they have my order memorized which is the cherry on top!!"}
{"text":"Just moved here a couple of months ago and this place by far has the best pizza around. I ordered pepperoni with extra cheese. I highly recommend getting extra cheese. The pizza was great and the crust was perfect. I asked for some ranch and the ranch is a must, too!  Nothing like eating the crust with ranch. I didn't know that they delivered, so next time we order I'll have it delivered. The customer service was great. The people working took the time to say hi to my 5 & 6 year old boys. Found out from previous reviews that this place is family owned and this means a lot to me!  I'm going to make this place my go to for pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service everytime!
Definitely a good place to stop by for lunch.
Prices are perfect aswell"}
{"text":"My go-to local independent pizza joint. I call it in, show up in 20 minutes and take home a great pie. Crust, sauce and cheese are solid with a decent selection of toppings. The crew is a good group. Leave 'em a tip."}
{"text":"We have gotten pizza here before.  It was ok, not particularly bad, but not anything special either.  It is also disappointing that they do not deliver.  

We decided to eat here tonight with our 2 toddler age children because it is a very casual atmosphere, good for kids and they had a special price on dine-in/take-out pizza.  I called ahead to order the pizza so when we arrived 10 minutes later it wouldn't take forever to cool off, since it is straight from the oven, so the kids could eat it.  The person on the phone refused to make our pizza ahead of time.  He told me they had \"had trouble with people pre-ordering dine in orders before\" & now refuse to do it.  

Please explain to me the difference between me ordering a pizza and you trusting I will come to pick it up for take out and me ordering a pizza and showing up to eat it there.  Either way, you are making a pizza and I am showing up after it is made and paying for it. What difference does it make where I eat it?  I did not appreciate being made to feel like an untrustworthy customer or the fact that we would have to show up, order, wait for the pizza to be made with antsy kids, then wait another 10-15 minutes for the pizza to cool before they could eat it.  Not my idea of a relaxing time!  So, no thanks Sunset Pizza!  We took our business elsewhere.  They were more than happy to accommodate our needs and had better prices and food than you.   We had a lovely evening, no thanks to your establishment.  We will not be returning for your \"nothing special\" food."}
{"text":"We just went here Saturday night and had the best plain pizza!!  I've been searching for a good east coast style pizza and have found it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. At first, it was great. We would order all the time. But, eventually, each time we came here, the pizza was a little less great. The last couple of times we ordered Sunset, it was bad -- extremely stingy with the cheese and even stingier with pepperoni. Most slices only had two pepperonis each, and there was actually a slice with One! I would love to hear that Sunset Pizzeria revives their old standards, but until I do, I won't even think about it."}
{"text":"Visited again today as I was famished from running errands.  I hadn't been in in a while as we've been doing take away from them.  It looks like perhaps they've either expanded to a second location and have new staff or they have sold the business.  In any case, the place looks a bit cleaner and they've put plaid tablecloths on the tables.  The staff was very nice and friendly and I am thrilled to say the quality hasn't changed!  The calzone was made to order and cooked to perfection.  The sauce was  very tasty.  I'm still a devoted customer!"}
{"text":"It's consistently hot & delicious even when they deliver. Honestly, probably the best cheesesteak in town. Our delivery driver knows us personally by this point & is such a nice guy. Great food & people. Support this & all local business."}
{"text":"Yay!! So excited to have found a great pizza place near me! I usually drive to the opposite side of town for pizza but Sunset is amazing. They have great salads and appetizers and it's never a long wait."}
{"text":"I order from here because the pizza tastes good. The pizza is flavorful NY style pizza. 

They deliver to my area which is great. The person that takes the order and delivery person have been professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Coupons and specials on the tables to make a great deal for your meal. Large varieties to choose from anything from sandwiches to pizza. It is more like a New York style or a fin cracker crust Chicago style pizza. Ingredients were fresh and service was fast"}
{"text":"This place nails the New York style. They have the look of a traditional New York style pizzeria but most importantly they have the taste of New York style pizza. The crust is done to perfection with the exact amount of crunch you want in every bite. If you have ever been to Manhattan, you know joes is the place to go and they have captured that here. Even the sauce has it going on. Don't be a fool and come try this place every slice is a work of art and the big guy Kyle is a composer and the oven is his orchestra."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza around. The French fries are incredible. The owners are extremely nice."}
{"text":"Eh this change ownership?  New website, the ranch and other things didnt taste the same.  No specials listed on their new website which is not user friendly.  Ranch tasted watered down.  Wings always cooked well but had a \"this fryer oil is just about to get stanky smell.\"  Not sure whats going on."}
{"text":"Few years ago I used to go to their other location on Sunset & Eastern and it was very good. However the pizza we had last night from this location on Horizon Ridge was terrible and tasteless.  Sorry to say but frozen pizza would have been better."}
{"text":"Best pizza and food in the city.   You can't go wrong    With anything you order dine in delivery or pick up."}
{"text":"We always wanted to try this place and we finally did about a month ago...boy were we pleasantly surprised!

The pizza was nice a crisp with generous toppings. We also ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and that was on point! We added mushrooms and jalapeños to it which made it even more so perfect. I have to say this is the best pizza place in Henderson and we'll definitely be back even though it's quite a distance from our place."}
{"text":"So I came here hoping to get an amazing slice of pizza and came up disappointed.  The gentleman working the counter was nice enough but there were some mistakes.  #1 I didn't like the sauce.  I like it a little sweeter and this had some tartness. Also, the dough was crunchy and chewy, not to mention so hott I burned the top of my mouth. I like the grease on top but this was too much it was piled on top like a grease lake sitting on top of my pepperonis. I wouldn't come back, fatty calories need to be worth it every time."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! So delicious and tastes like it's from New York!!! The service is wonderful too!! I love coming here to relax and enjoy some quality pizza!!! Also free wifi!! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings. Food was ready for pick up. Food tasted good, not really outstanding in any way. The ranch dressing was fresh and appeared to be made at the restaurant. Kinda expensive for XL pizza and half a bucket of wings(20 wings). $41+. Glad I went to pick it up to avoid tipping."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place, the Lunch specials are a great deal & include a side & drink for under 10$. Usually go for the philly cheese steak or a giant cal zone . Their fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Used this place a few weeks ago, first time. Order taker assured me best pizza in henderson. Ordered pizza Sausage & Mushrooms, Got delivered a large pizza, maybe 15 pieces of sausage, almost no mushrooms. Called back to complain, Was basically told to go F.. myself. Wanted to talk to owner, but was told he was not available. AVOID this pizza dump."}
{"text":"We really love this place.  The pizza is great.  And the price is great.  We've only tried a few other items on their menu: antipasto salad, fried mushrooms, and wings.  All were very good.  Occasionally we stop in for their 2 slices and a drink lunch special and eat in their dining room.
The only downside is that nowadays we find ourselves eating more pizza than we should be!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza & hands down best ranch ever!!! Pick up is the best I had it delivered once and it was totally cold, so we just go there & get it or eat there :)"}
{"text":"I like Sunset Pizza but they gave me the shaft........... Pizza was cold when i came to order it to go by the box it looks like it was someone elses pizza that cancelled there was a order number crossed out on the box give me a break thats just plain bs lazy lazy lazy..Our Italian sub not toasted how dare you......... Fries reheated strike three  Fyi short hair  mexican guy was the cook and short haired white guy with beard at register if you see these guys there check your food before leaving. I want my tip back"}
{"text":"Great take out specials. The pizza, chicken fingers, fries etc. Excellent! Their ranch is also to die for. Amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Sunset pizza is consistent. That's a good thing today. I always forget to order from them because they really don't advertise and unless you're driving slowly down Horizon you miss it. Still it's good and the prices are moderate. Not cheap but not expensive."}
{"text":"This place is by the house and I've driven by it 100 times so we finally decided to try it. Pros: family owned shop with good service, decent prices. Cons: pizza was good, but not great like Grimaldi's. The crust was light and airy but lacked flavor. Toppings were good. I really wanted to love this place but I'll try it again and see if it's better next time. Will be back."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I have this place a shot, but I must say we were disappointed. I lived in New York for 3 years and this was nothing like the pizza I experienced there. 23 bux for a pizza and 2 drinks...I'd rather go to Napoli pizza and for 8 bux get a better pie."}
{"text":"Strangely enough I don't think I have ever gotten a pizza from here. When I visit I go for the Philly cheese steak. Although they are missing the authentic bread of Steakout or Pop's, it is a very good sandwich. For a quick, casual lunch or dinner, this is one of my wife and my favorite spots in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Highly recommend!!!!!! It's a little pizza shop but well worth the drive. The prices are good and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Did it again and we were pleased. he pie was awesome with the pepperoni.  about a 4.5 but they did well this time."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great calzones. Delivery is a little slow but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Excellent customer service.  The lunch deal is very economical...and the pizza is filling.  Plan on taking my husband here soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. I thought the spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good. We stopped in to order takeout and the service was fast and courteous. Looking forward to trying more from their menu."}
{"text":"Delivery was super super fast!     Pizza was good but not the best.   But for delivery they were super super great"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza I've ever had aside from Villa !! Prices are great too :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok. I guess I'm spoiled after trying Evel Pie. Salad was good and chicken fingers were spicy. Won't go back."}
{"text":"So this place is located 4.4 miles and a 10 min drive from me and apparently they don't deliver to the location despite having done so before. Decent pizza but if you don't deliver within 5 miles where do you deliver???"}
{"text":"I Love Sunset Pizzeria!  I was introduced to this place by a good friend and now it has sort of become \"our place\".  We both really love the chicken cheese steaks with peppers and onions. We always order fries with our cheese steaks and there is just something about their ranch dressing.  I am a sucker for a good white pizza and this place delivers just that. They have a couple different options of white pizzas that are interesting too.  Their crust is not too thick, not too thin and has just the right amount of crisp.  The staff is friendly, even when we walk in close to closing."}
{"text":"Just craving pizza. A little skeptical, I don't like sweet sauce, but the pizza was good."}
{"text":"I usually come to this place after I catch a movie from Cinemark. They have pretty good pizza a bit oily though so I try and get well done. They have a pretty good cheese steak sandwich. Good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I live just down the street and finally decided to try this place out. Boy am I glad we did! Ordered their 2 slice pizza special and I've gotta say the pizza was absolutely delicious!! Thin crust, no heavy pizza sauce (yay), and wonderfully melted mozzarella cheese that when you take a bite you keep biting because the cheese is so slinky :). Everything I could ever ask for in a slice of pizza. The slices are giant and satisfying. Hands down best pizza I've tried in this city. Oh and the friendly, smiley faces on the cashier and young lady were the icing on the cake. Great pizza and great customer service... Yes please!

had to take away a star because everytime we order a pizza for pick-up, it's never the cheesy goodness that i described above."}
{"text":"Had a Caesar salad and a large pep pizza! Sooo good! I'll go again next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Stopped in based off reviews on Yelp. Friendly staff, excellent NY style pizza. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone way down since, the last time I ate here. Order the mozzarella sticks and they tasted like cardboard,  I've never tasted cardboard but I assume it taste like nothing .  The sauce was also  watered down . My sandwich had no sauce and was dry like a bone."}
{"text":"Updated review..... and they still hit a solid 4 stars! Since the change in ownership in September the only difference you'll see is they redecorated the place (took away some of the charm, but it looks much better) and got rid of that god awful country music.

The pizza is still great, they still don't cut corners, just wish they put some oregano in the sauce or cheese. My wife got the meatballs and spaghetti one night with a salad and garlic bread. Meatballs weren't half bad, but the spaghetti & marinara were standard \"pizza place\" quality, same goes for the salad, and the garlic bread was pretty standard.

This is still my 'go to' pizza place for parties and days my body screams for carbs."}
{"text":"I love the white pizza here, it's delicious, but a little pricey.  The last few times we've called in an order they've told us it'll be 20-25 minutes but then when I get there to pick it up, it seems like it's been sitting out for awhile."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for true NY style pizza in Las Vegas . Extra large is the way to go. Great from the tip to the last bite of crust. Even open today on Memorial Day. Awesome!! 
I'm pretty sure that before I started traveling for work I ordered a pizza from Sunset every weekend as I enjoyed it that much. So good that I may order one right now..."}
{"text":"very good pizza, huge pasta dishes, delicious wings and fries.  A little pricey, but good."}
{"text":"Got a large cheese pizza for around $9. The pizza was so good! Even better their ranch is amazing! Best pizza ranch I've ever had. They are super nice. They let me put my froyo in their freezer while I was waiting. Did I mention the ranch?! They also give you a ton of it. A whole pizza and i didn't even use it all. Will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place and I did for a short while. I am an Italian food snob to some degree. I grew up in the Bronx New York near Arthur Avenue Little Italy and was raised on homemade Italian food. My all-time favorite is chicken parmesan. I ordered one from sunset about eight weeks ago and it was rather enjoyable. Actually it was quite good this sauce I thought was outstanding. The second time I ordered I asked that the pasta be put on the side with garlic,  butter and olive oil. It was dry as all heck. There was no garlic in it at all just a little olive oil. No big deal I'm used to being disappointed in this world today. I called about a week later and told them about the side order of pasta and ask them to maybe put a little effort into it which they did and it was okay. Then a week or so later I called again for the same meal this time they gave me 3 slivers of chicken which I later found out was chicken fingers they give to kids because it was near closing time. I mean it was probably about one-third of the portions I was used to getting here before and other places. I called to complain and they said we owe you one. Everyone deserves a second maybe even a third chance. I called tonight and took them up on their offer and ordered my chicken parmesan with the pasta on the side and when I got it there was literally a couple drops of cheese on the whole thing. Again the chicken cutlet was cut up as it was going to be used for chicken fingers. Anyway a huge disappointment again so I need to find another place to order my weekly chicken parmesan take out.... like I said I really wanted to like this place it's so close to where I live. If anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear them. I'm hoping the order reads this and fixes the problem. Very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service!!  I ordered a take out delivery right after a bad rain storm.  The credit card machine was down and all I had was $11 on me.  The lady said, \"don't worry, I'll just take that\".  It was about a $25 order.  We order from them all the time and now I tip the driver extra!  A large cheese take out is only $10.  Great deal and much better than Metro!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, great lunchtime specials.  If I hear another east coast goon bemoan \"there's no good pizza in Vegas\" I'm gonna lose it. I swear 20% of the people living here are NY transplants.  If you can't find a good slice in Vegas, you obviously haven't tried, or wouldn't know a good slice if it was sitting on your face."}
{"text":"good pizza: dough is very good & consistent product for carryout (delivery: $2). single topping large pie for $10 is what to order. they bill it as new york style - i'll just call it tasty.
guys that work here seem like they might _just_ be frm new york (if that's an excuse for curt service).  sometimes when i've been in there I've heard some pretty rough talk from the staff, so take that fwiw."}
{"text":"We get take out from Sunset once every two weeks the crust is perfect and they don't over do it with the sauce.  If you want thick crust and heavy sauce go back to Chicago, this is NY style pizza.  
The take out/eat in special is now a $9.99 large cheese, it was a one topping.  economy I guess...  Still great for the price."}
{"text":"We had delivery and it looked promising at first. I ordered a pepperoni calzone and it had no pepperoni. It must have been like 5 lbs of cheese and it was difficult to eat. The bell peppers I asked for on it were totally raw too."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Nevada. Love the pizza. The sides are great.  Come here about once every two weeks and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Overdue review . I eat here on occasion . I always get the large cheese pie for 9.99 . Not only is it a bargain . Definitely one of the best NY style pizzas in town."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to say I saw the reviews and decided to pop in. This is my new favorite pizza place! Hands down. I usually am just \"meh\" about most pizza, but the service, quality, and general environment about this place sets it apart. It seems like most families in the area love it here! In terms of loving this place, I am no exception! I have been recommending like crazy!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! Love coming here for their $10 carry out special and I love their lunch special of 2 pizzas and a drink for $5! They add the perfect amount of sauce, unlike some places that are so stingy with it. The staff are so friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed! They play great music so if you're eating alone it's not depressing and you're not listening to sad greys anatomy music that makes you think about life."}
{"text":"For starters this place now has new owners, really new owners like in this past week kind of new. The food is so good I've been sent back almost every day since , no one wants to eat home anymore. And with such excellent food and service it is easy to stop all that cooking at home nonsense.
 The owners and workers are courteous , professional yet friendly and care about their customers. I can't tell you how many nasty salads I have been served in this town and here it is FRESH , excellent ! - washed well & doesn't taste like pesticides or it came out of a freezer ladled with sulfites like some casinos will give you ! WOW , fresh real food what a concept!! I wish more places had this much common sense. 
 Quality deli meats & generous portions. 
Fried foods are the bomb! Eggplant is the real deal. Big menu for a pizza place with enough choices for different preferences or dietary needs. You can get chicken fingers, chicken wings, zucchini, mushrooms, salads , meatballs, Italian dinners, pizzas with all kinds of toppings, gyros , cheese-steaks,  and burgers. 
Do not shy away from the burgers..  I know the Italian is so good you may think to yourself  \"Eh, I can gets burgers anywhere and why bother at a sub shop.. you know why?! Because it is huge and fresh and the bun actually holds the meat! Because it is gourmet size real cooked to order food. That is why. No weird mystery pink fillers or soy.. just meat! imagine that?!
Seriously this place rocks. Speaking of they play good music and often have the better shows  playing on the TV. You won't be tortured with loud inappropriate music or watching Rachel Ray selling waist cinchers! ( woo hoo!).
Most importantly they are accommodating . You can get fries or a salad with your sub which is great. It's a nice side salad too with red onion, cucumbers , tomatoes.
Size friendly seating, and clean.
They deliver! I give 5 stars sparingly so check with place out if you can.
** Tip: Best deal is the lasagna with antipasto salad for 20.99 you can't go wrong there.
** They have lunch specials including drinks every day until 4pm."}
{"text":"Still the best place in Henderson for pizza!
Jodi your awesome!
Sometimes I like to make pizza or Stromboli's at home and I buy my pizza dough here!"}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza place. It's New York style, but a little less greasy. Great service, and they're also incredibly consistent - good thing, because I order from here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a tiny neighborhood pizza place. Not great either. The pizza crust was crunchy and perfectly cooked. The ingredients on our pepperoni and mushroom were just ok, not top shelf ingredients. The chicken wings were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Hot, fresh, and yummy pizza. Crust is awesome- I love a good thin crust and theyve got it. Its fun, sporty atmosphere, and really good customer service. I highly recommend Sunset pizza"}
{"text":"Nothing special about their pizza or pasta. Had a carry out orders. Small place, my first time with their food."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and when I come to Henderson I always get a pizza here.  Excellent food.  Little pricey but what isn't around Vegas."}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars I would! This place is the real deal; excellent pizza, excellent prices, and excellent service! The new owners have really fixed the place up and are great people. This is the only place I go for pizza in Henderson. 

-The hot wings are excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Hubby wanted carbs for dinner so we decided to try a new place for a change!  

Ordered the \"Mikey's Favorite\" (former owner's name) -- and it was dellliiiiicious!  We also had the mild chicken wings -- and the Ranch sauce that came with it was excellent!  We even dipped our pizza in the sauce!  They have the new and fancy \"touch screen\" soda machine... love all the drink options!  

Thank you, owner and Chef Kyle!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza we have had in the Vegas Valley.  We drive from the east side of Las Vegas to eat here.  Great people and great food!  Love you Jody and Mike!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, steak sandwich, fresh hot steak fries, stromboli freshly made. The lasagna great, Nick and his staff great, that is why I keep coming back.  :):) Great prices"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new pizza place to try while watching Monday night football. I saw Sunset had pretty good reviews and gave them a try. I knew it was a bad sign when I picked up the box of our X-large pizza and it felt empty. 

There were three of us so we went with the X-large with sausage, mushrooms and green peppers. When I got home I noticed there were hardly any toppings visible and very little cheese. I did like the crust, it was thin and crispy. However the complete lack of cheese and toppings was a big disappointment. 

There are way too many pizza places in this town to be skimpy with toppings and still charge $20."}
