{"text":"I went few months ago with my friends and sister we were very excited to try bbq hotpot for the first time OH BOI how i regret going to that place.. 1st the table they gave us was sticky and dirty.. second the portable stove was also sticky and dirty... 3rd My sister found a \"PLASTIC\" in her eggroll (The man whom we complained to takes it and puts it in his pocket and says that \"It's Normal\" WTF? ) . Then when we payed for everything they still wanted tip from my sister O_o... and yes the man who took the plastic was no where to be found.

 I would never ever recomend this place to anyone or to even give it another chance this is the worst restaurant i ever and i mean ever went to."}
{"text":"I went there with a few friends 3 weeks ago, it's an all-you-can-eat hotpot buffet for $20, plus free beer. It was soooo good! I had never had hotpot before but had been meaning to try it for a while now. Everyone loved it. They played Christmas music and happy birthday for a while but I figure that's just part of the random weirdness you get when eating at asian places lol.  Along with the waitress misunderstanding us and offering us milk when we asked for soft drinks. Personally it didn't bother me, I just found it funny :P We only had the hotpot, not the bbq. The food was all fresh, they had a really good selection too. The smell from the bbq was tantalizing, I'm definitely gonna go back there for the bbq as well."}
{"text":"So I'm back in Montreal again, this time just with the wife and no kids...
We take a nap at our favorite motel, head over the bridge and cruise into Chinatown around 9:00 PM.  We decide to try this place, because three years ago we went to it.  I think its under new ownership and frankly it was somewhat disappointing.  I'm giving it three stars because the food was ok.  But there was no staff!?  It was a Friday night, one week 
before Labor day and the town is crawling with tourists.   For some reason they have one hostess, who is also the only waitstaff.  

So we get the BBQ, which includes free beer!  The meat selection was ok, I guess.  They had some nice selections of appetizers on a side bar.  I loved the pig ear salad!  So I asked for some soup, it turns out they only let you make soup if you pick the hot pot, not the bbq.  So the hostess graciously gives me a pot of soup plus some veggies that I picked out.  But then it was down hill from there.  I asked for a half glass of beer, because a full glass would have reduced my capacity for food by half.  After the meal I asked for some tea, the hostess spaced out, so ten minutes later I nixed the tea and asked for another half glass of beer, again, she took someone's order and spaced out again.  So we left and  I will come back, but next time will bring in my own drinks.  The food again was ok, not really much of selection of greens.  But the meats seemed pretty good, and the prices were definitely reasonable.   Again they need to get on the ball with the staff, more training and just more staff!!!  Please!!!"}
