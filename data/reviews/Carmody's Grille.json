{"text":"Love this place. Best new bar/restaurant in the area. Limited, but excellent, on tap beer list. Food is solid. Good vibe. If you haven't been, definitely give it a try. Similar to Good Fellas on Mt. Nebo Rd. acros the river."}
{"text":"Got here on a Saturday night around 6:30 and was seated immediately. Waitress was at our table within s couple minutes and took our drink order. We got the fried pickles and they were wonderful.  Had the seafood salad and power slaw. Everything was amazing. Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Great place wonderful staff and food I have tried several dishes all great try provolone balls nicest bartenders around they really make you feel welcome especially since I come in by myself chef Anthony is a gem talented and sincerely nice owners really got it right"}
{"text":"I'm the middle of a shady area . Food was over priced .  Too far to go for really a average burger"}
{"text":"Just ate at Carmody's  in Neville Island. Food was okay, service was a little to be desired. Our party of 6 had 3 checks only one was correct.  Waitress was extremely rude when it was bought to her attention.  She corrected one check and copied the check  that was correct  for one that was wrong. Told her again she grabbed all the checks the checks with an attitude and corrected them.  One couple paid cash and had to ask for her change."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Had a Reuben and it was really good. Sauerkraut was a little more bitter than I am used to but was still good. The onion rings are outstanding."}
{"text":"I came here with family as I'm visiting from San Diego. It was so much fun! They have a great beer and wine selection. The food was delicious!! There was a man playing guitar on the patio. The building was awesome, very pretty. It was cool to have an inside/outside bar. Our waitress was very fun, and made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Just found out that it still exist. Went for dinner tonight. When the other place closed we were sad. All is the same if you remember how good it is. Had my favorite the zucchini the best ever. Wife
And I had a sandwich. Made with real food. Stop by you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Welcome back Carmody's... great addition to Neville Island!  Great atmosphere but limited seating but weather permitting they do have an outside patio, friendly staff and the owner try's to reach out and talk to everyone! Great job.  

We had the fried Zucchini was excellent! Would recommend everyone to try it.  The fresh cut fries YES!  The French Dip was also a 10 however the fish I wouldn't recommend... it's a cookie cutter cut portion like from Gorton's or McDonald's, thin, breading, flat on flavor ; ( 
 I took it home and gave it to my cats.   

So in all the everything gets a 10 except for the fish...... stop by & see what you think..."}
{"text":"When making my annual trek to Pittsburgh, I typically do the Eat N Park thing.  I just like that place.   I was tired and didn't want to travel far, so the hotel recommended Carmody's Grille.  I am so glad they did.  

The first thing I noticed was that the staff was friendly, but not in a sycophant type of way, just glad you decided to visit for a meal.  The server recommended some things, so I opted for the burger.  I am so glad I did. The first thing I noticed about my burger is that was hot, not that lukewarm stuff restaurants serve these days out of a fear of folks burning their mouth.  The bun was well toasted and the cheese was melted just right.  

I also had the homemade apple pie and ice cream, which was a bit disappointing.  The pie was supposed to be warmed (not sure why they didn't just put it in the microwave for about 60 seconds), but it actually was cold.  You do get a generous slice of pie, so I ate the crust, but the apples were a bit hard.  When I was asked by the manager or owner how it was, I did indicate that it was cold and not that enjoyable.  She offered to fix the situation, but I felt I had consumed more than a bite and told her I was fine.  Frankly, I shouldn't have been eating pie anyway, so it's a good thing I didn't eat the whole piece :-).

I went back the next night and just had an entr√©e.  Service was just as good and the meal was delicious.  I opted for takeout and the bartender was very attentive.

The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be stopping by Carmody's again.  I have also told my family in the area that it's worth a trip to Neville's Island to check them out!"}
{"text":"Very good local restaurant. The recent remodel as others have stated, makes the place look really nice. Very nice at area. Really good food for a decent price. Jacey was our waitress and was super nice. Would recommend for anybody to try this place and hopefully they will get a great dinner at a very reasonable price with good service!"}
{"text":"When one thinks of Neville Island, one really doesn't think of groovy classy bars.  Not saying anything adverse about the island or its residents .... it's just Neville Island is known for its industrial presence right?  We'll think again kids.  We went to Carmody's last night for a birthday party and I LOVE this place!  Classy, clean, and the staff are all wonderful.  The food for the party buffet was awesome and the wings were om nom nom alicious.  Rumor has it they rock fried zucchini like no other.  It's a fairly new establishment which is kind of a bummer because many moons ago I used to work on Neville Island and you can bet your bright blue britches this place would have been my hangout.  If you're looking for a great place with great food and a casual but classy vibe ..... you just found it."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. Zucchini and Turtle Soup are the same as we remember from the original Carmody's. French Dip is my favorite! Actually, everything that we have ordered so far is excellent! Nice atmosphere and very clean! Everyone from the greeters to the owners are always friendly and make us feel at home. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to unwind."}
{"text":"Had the artichoke and kale dip and it was absolutely the best artichoke dip I have ever had. Also had the fish sandwich and onion rings. Hand breaded onion rings were wonderful. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The re-model looks fantastic.  Took a peek upstairs.  It is not open yet but shouldn't be too long.
Went for dinner.  Everything was good, except they currently really don't have a dinner menu other than what they have on special.  Server informed us they are still doing a 'soft opening'.   Our group had the zucchini strips for an appetizer and then the shaved french dip, chicken sandwich and the shrimp rolls.  Sandwiches served with fries or power slaw (which I'm assuming is cole slaw). 
My only problem with the shrimp rolls was that while it is supposed to be on a grilled butter bun, it seemed more like 2 slices of bread folded in half.  And the one was falling apart with the shrimp falling through.  Also had a chocolate covered strawberry martini which was very good but a bit pricey at $9.95.  

Meal was $58 without the tip."}
{"text":"Just bar food? Yea maybe but it is a cut above. Mancinis Hogie rolls is a great start.
The bride had fish tacos. She enjoyed then along with those onions rings too good to be true. I had a large codfish on that Mancinis. Side of fresh cut fries were great. So what did I miss? Well the zuchinmi fries appetizer. We are addicted to most places nearby version. Carmody's hit it out of the park. I wish we had ventured In Sooner. 
Not fine dining but certainly great bar food. Can't wait to test the menu again"}
{"text":"Had a lovely summer dinner on the patio. Great outdoor patio, great beer and wine list. Fish tacos are wonderful. Reasonably priced menu. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Nice bar, very clean with a beautiful outdoor area. Food was awesome and reasonably priced. They probably have the best French dip sandwich in Pittsburgh. 

Fast & friendly staff and a good place to watch a game. Beer selection is decent."}
{"text":"Great place to meet family and friends.
Owners are on site to stop by your table and say hi and check on your service.
Very friendly owners and staff.
Food was good and fresh.
My mother loves the Fried Zucchini....oh and the selections of beers. 
The rest of our table ordered the Cod.  It was very good.
Fish sandwich is huge.
Fries are excellent.
This was my second visit to Carmody's Grille.
I will be back again while in Pittsburgh.
And YES, I would suggest this place to friends for an evening out."}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Salmon salad - it was good! Not going to blow anyone away, but the overall experience was good enough to recommend over the other local choices in the area. Good prices, too."}
{"text":"If stumble upon Neville Island - give Carmody's Grille a try. Don't turn left towards Paradise Bowling - turn right past King's - and keep going until you find Carmody's on your right. 

This restaurant was original off the Wexford exit, but the location has been open for a least 2 years. I believe they are going to expand in the next store front, but this restaurant & bar has plenty of room for the whole family. 

We hit the restaurant around 6pm on Sunday evening - it wasn't busy, so we got seated right away. 

To start we ordered a bottle of Shine Riesling & my dad ordered a Yuengling draft. They have plenty of drafts on tap. 

For our apps - we ordered the zucchini appetizer and the fried cheese balls. They were both good. 

For my entree, I ordered the large fish sandwich with a side of fries. This sandwich was delicious and the fries were were good. I would definitely order this fish sandwich again. 

Overall, I'll come be back to Carmody's again s"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of style.   I stumbled in the bar after a work event.    The drinks were good, the food was amazing. 

You must get the fried zucchini is awesome.   If you are on Neville Island - check this place out."}
{"text":"I have frequented the original Carmodys for years. This is not it. The food was sub par other then the zucchini. The service was slow. To top all of this off, they lease a parking lot and a landscape boulder was  left in there parking lot causing thousands of dollars in damages to my car. Then I guess one of the owners is a lawyer so they give me a card and say he will handle only to take no responsibility and Blame me for this boulder blocking a parking spot. No wonder the parents didn't leave them the original place. Poorly run, bad food, bad owner. Stay away. Many better choices to be had."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way so far. Clean, well  designed, great beer and food. This is awesome!!! So far I just got the fresh cut fries and they were great."}
{"text":"Having read a very favorable review from \"Munch\" of the Pgh. Post-Gazette, I decided to give it a try.  I got there around 2;30 PM on Thursday.  First problem is parking, which is on-street only and very limited close to the bar.  Walking in, I noted what is going to be their outdoor deck area, which looks like it will be nice.  Inside, with apparently a complete remodel, is light and airy, a pleasant atmosphere.  I was seated and served quickly.  I felt the menu was quite limited, far more appetizers listed than anything else.  I also felt that the prices were quite high.  I mean, in Sewickley or Fox Chapel, $9 for zucchini strips and $12 for a burger would be business as usual, but on NEVILLE ISLAND??  I asked for and received an au jus cup of a little turtle soup to try, as I never had, and I was considering soup and a sandwich.  It was spicy and tasty, but in the end, I ordered one of the specials--Salisbury steak with mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes and corn.  My order came very quickly, and the food was standard comfort food fare--a burger patty about 3\" in diameter, and mushroom gravy which had a good flavor.  The mashed potatoes were piled high, also covered with the gravy, and they contained actual pieces of potato, so they were \"real\".  The corn was, well, corn.  With it, I had a domestic draft beer, I want to say maybe 20oz., which was $2.95.  Sorry, I don't recall the price of the special I had, but it was actually reasonable.  My suggestion to the owners is, if you want to be in this for the long haul and not just the grand opening yahoos, you should probably bring ALL your prices, both food and beverage, down to your \"specials\" level.  Location means a GREAT deal, and you seem to be offering champagne prices in a beer neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just returned from our first and last visit to carmodys.  I asked the waitress what the specials were and she said their were none even though I could hear the waitress at the table next to us telling her customers the specials. The zucchini was undercooked and so were the wings when I told the waitress she said she would inform the kitchen and then she never came back.  My husbands cod fish sandwich was totally tasteless and the fries were overlooked and no taste.  The power slaw was great .  For what  we paid we could have had 2 nice dinners somewhere else. When the waitress returned I asked for a container for the wings took them home cooked them the next day and they were still lousy greasy and only the top few were sprinkled with garlic par. What a rip off."}
{"text":"Great place. Worth a try. Huge portions. The fried zucchini was heaven. I had the fish, more than I could eat. Bathrooms were spotless and I'm a bit of a germaphobe. There is a parking lot adjacent to the location. Furnishings and remodel are very appealing. I found prices to be in line."}
{"text":"So good!!  I'm a French fri snob and these are some of the best hands down Gabriela was our server, her recommendations were spot on !!   The turtle soup ROCKS !!   I saw a past review of the service and I'm shocked 
We've been there multiple times and were treated  with fantastic service every time   Some people just can't be made happy, no matter what you do 
We'll be back to see you Gabriela!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, right by my work, go here all the time for happy hour. The food is great too. A little pricey for being the only bar on Neville island. Get more deals!! And lower lunch prices. Just a thought!!"}
{"text":"Update on my prior review and my stars are a a reflection of both visits. 

We returned for dinner and sat at the bar this time. Had to wait for a few minutes for service but the bartender was super friendly when she got to us. We ordered some drinks and food, including the turtle soup. The turtle soup came first and I tried it - ugh, super salty and earthy. Definitely stronger flavor than other turtle soups I have had. I told the bartender that I wasn't a fan and wanted to get a salad instead. She took the soup and graciously removed it from our bill. The other parts of our dinner were good but not memorable. After food was delivered, we weren't visited again so I never got another drink like I had wanted. 

I want to give this place one more chance. I hope service is a little tighter and the food is more consistent between visits. I definitely WANT to like this place!"}
{"text":"I remember Carmody's in Wexford. For years it was my family's go to restaurant for family milestones. We were heartbroken when it closed. Then I heard about Carmody's Grille and I could not wait to try it.

If you're going there looking for the same style and decor as the old Wexford location, then yes, you are going to be disappointed. There are no teal vinyl seats and ceramic clowns to see - and I say that with nothing but love for all of it. But this is a new type of establishment, run by the family and carrying over many of their standards, and that is more than enough to celebrate.

We ordered the the fried zucchini and were so pleased that it was EXACTLY as we remembered it. They do need to bring back that crazy horseradish sauce they used to serve with it, but it came with a marinade that worked very well. You cannot NOT order this.

I ordered the large fish sandwich which is planko breaded and served on a Mancini roll. Please. Fantastic. My wife had the Reuben and said it was really great.

Non alcoholic beverages, a large appetizer and two large sandwiches with home cut fries and it was about $40. That's not bad, and the service is great. 

I cannot wait to go back and in the meantime I'll tell everyone how great it is, even though I'd rather keep it to myself!"}
{"text":"Recommended from the hotel and i was not disappointed. Had the prime rib dip and a Guinness on tap. Delicious!!  Just wish tbe patio was open did not likt the table in front of the hostess booth."}
{"text":"This was bookmarked on my Yelp page and I finally had the time to go. In fact, I went twice within one week. This is a very cool place tucked into an older industrial park. Driving to get there I thought I had the address wrong. But then BOOM!  there it was. We were delighted when we walked in. It's actually a very cool place with a great wine list as well as a great beer list. 
My first time there I had the Cowboy Steak. It is a ribeye that comes with grill marks. My steak was cooked to order. That doesn't always happen when you order steak. The inside was cooked to a perfect medium. The outside was slightly too charred for me but it was still good. It came with asparagus and potatoes. The potatoes were slightly crispy on the outside and seasoned perfectly. I love asparagus but theirs was too soft for my liking. I prefer that it be firm.  My husband ordered Beef Tips over Rice. It has a lot of mushrooms but they bring the flavor. The beef tips were some of the best I've ever had. I had their homemade coconut pie for dessert. It is delicious!  The crust is flaky. As we say in the south, \"It's so good it makes you want to slap your momma.\"  (That's a compliment.) 
A few days later we were going to dinner with friends. They always want me to pick the place. I chose this little gem. My husband ordered fish tacos. You get two in an order. They come with large chunks of fish. The tacos taste fresh and really it the spot. I ordered the Talapia with the lemon and caper Piccata sauce over rice. There were 3 big pieces of fish. They were cooked and seasoned well. The Piccata sauce was on point. I almost licked the plate. It came with asparagus and it was wimpy as it was earlier in the week. For dessert I had chocolate pie. It was the real deal old school kind. It also had the scrumptious flaky crust. 
Everyone looks bed their food. We had a great dinner. 
I was disappointed that they don't take reservations but the woman I talked to said that she would put us on the call list under my name. One set of friends got their before me and we were not on the list. They put us on the list.  Thankfully they were seated right before my husband and I got their at the exact time I had requested."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was very happy to find and try Carmody's.  We tried the zucchini and steak salad.  I even recommend the turtle soup!"}
{"text":"Late arrival on a Monday. Hotel sent me to Carmody's. 
Excellent prime rib french dip. Beef so tender and the roll was just excellent. 
Honestly the best french dip I've ever had. 
Patti took good care of me. Shes tough yet kind. Wonderful bar tender."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!  Great job remodeling and a nice trendy bar.  Staff and ownership is very friendly as well!  Definitely recommend Carmody's!!!!  Best place on Neville Island!"}
{"text":"Fantastic new place!! Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff - (especially bartenders Kevin, Patti & Sandy) make for a great overall experience. The food is out of this world. I highly recommend the French Dip, Fried Zucchini, Steak Burger and pretty much everything on the menu on any given day. The chef is awesome and her daily specials and creations keep me coming back for more! Can't wait until the weather is better so we can enjoy the outside patio as well. The owners and manager care about your experience there and make efforts to incorporate changes based on suggestions! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great menu! Great bar! The power slaw and zucchini appetizer was excellent. I ordered a prime rib sandwich and it was delicious. My fianc√© ordered fish tacos and loved them. Definitely a local spot."}
{"text":"Great new place that a friend recommended.  Great atmosphere. Friendly people. And the food was excellent and had a unique spin. Obviously a good chef. Prices we're good too!"}
{"text":"Busy place at lunch time.  Interesting long narrow place with a long bar with windows that open up into a outdoor type of place that is covered & walled by that old ripple fiberglass and has some space heaters.

A nice list of beers on a chalkboard.  Also a small chalkboard with daily specials and soup of the day. Was interested in some of the appetizers but not real hungry...probably should have gotten a couple of appetizers instead I ordered the Bacon Turkey Swiss on a croissant with lettuce and tomato. The sandwich that comes with a choice of fresh cut fries or power slaw.  The sandwich and fries were good.  
Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food great people! The beer is cold and the food is plentiful. Have to try the zucchini and the Reubens are great."}
{"text":"This is a comfortable place for a drink and a sandwich.  

The restaurant does not have an extensive menu so expect to order a sandwich or a salad.

We've been a few times and the service is very friendly and we've tried most of the menu between us and guests.

Nice bar, friendly service.  

What they offer, they do it well."}
{"text":"Great place in Neville, super close to RMU rinks to grab drinks or great food. Have a mix of great beers and awesome mixed drinks and their food is always superb. Service is unmatched in Pittsburgh. The outside looks a little run down but the inside is really nice with an large outdoor area with access to the bar. Well worth the time."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to eat after driving all day. Expansive beer menu, I chose a Southern IPA. It was what I needed after a long day driving.

The food is well done, nice combination of traditional bar food with some innovative entrees."}
