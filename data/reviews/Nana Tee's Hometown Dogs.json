{"text":"Excellent grub!!!!! Mmmm mmm mmm!!! 
The staff are friendly and down too earth.
I couldn't decide between the Sonoran Hotdog or mushroom swiss burger I had both! And I loved them both. I'm happy I have a huge appetite so I can enjoy both. I will definitely be coming back here during my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"I thought the tater tots were the best I have ever had. The hot dogs were very good and the service was great. I give my rating based on how likely I would go back and if I would make the 30 min drive again; the answer would be \"no\". Though all those things were good, the atmosphere was poor and the cleanliness was mediocre. There was no hiding that the previous business was a Quiznos and there was no effort to make it their own. The sings were just pulled off and the tape residue was still present... The bathrooms were disgusting and my theory has always been; if they are comfortable with the bathrooms being dirty they are comfortable with other things being dirty."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! This is a locally owned joint that serves up some incredible hot dogs, polish dogs, hamburgers ect. Also their salsa is amazing. The owners are really nice and helpful! I love that it's in my neighborhood. Give it a try if you're hankering for something that will make your taste buds scream for more!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience, I had the $5 lunch special and it was great!   The people behind the counter were well mannered and eager to make the dining experience great."}
{"text":"Was not impressed this used to be a Quiznos and they are using sandwich toaster to cook tater tots portion was extremely small it was smaller than a small size of the tater tots anywhere else they were not hot or crispy what do you expect use in a toaster oven for sandwiches the hot dog lacks flavor they said that you sauteed mushrooms which had no flavor at all again the hot dog was cold had to wait for tater tots to get done in the toaster decided to order a tamale although the homemade salsa is amazing tamale was cold yes the tamale was cold was not impressed with the prices  for cold food father and son team was extremely nice tables were not clean they still had crumbs on there to be honest I got better hot dogs from a food cart they really need to improve their temperatures of the food and if they can't do tater tots right put something different on the menu there is no excuse for a cold tamale and a flavorless hot dog I even ask for extra seasoning hello I wasn't impressed flavorless but salsa was only thing I like so disappointed"}
{"text":"Greatest tasting Polish Dog! Polish sausage was tender, sauerkraut had Great flavor! Great service!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place because of a coupon in the Clipper magazine I got in the mail.  I'll have to go back a few times to try all the different dogs.  I got a Lil Italy brat with the potato salad this time.  SO good.  A friend had the Wisconsin and also loved it.  I doubt you could go wrong here.  They've got punch cards for frequent eaters.  I took home some salsas but did try some mild at the store.  Very fresh and good.  For those of us who are cilantro haters... the owner said with notice they can make some without!  That's some good service!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best hot dog place in phoenix,  friendly service, and cool cats love hot dogs.  Make it the way you want or come up with a recipe of your own and if they like it they will put it on the menu.  If enough customers buy the recipe they will remain on the menu.. It is a must try. Diane & Bill F"}
{"text":"This place makes the best hot dogs I recently had one and I am hooked I will be going back for sure. the service is great and so is the food. this will be one of my regular places to go."}
{"text":"You will never feel more American than when you eat a hot dog at Nana Tees!  The first thing I tried was the Sonoran Dog and it was great!  So many things looked so good I wish I could have tried them all.  I can't wait to go back and try something new.  BTW their homemade salsa is award winning... Literally!  Very friendly, easily conversational staff and reasonable pricing.

Been going back since and found a new favorite... The Philly! very tasty with a brat."}
{"text":"Bomb! Ass! Veggie! Dog! Seriously, the best veggie dog I've ever had. I could not tell it was a veggie dog and it had the snap of a quality hotdog with great flavor. I like to eat healthy and they had plenty of healthy alternatives. I got a Chicago Style veggie dog with grilled broccoli and it was delicious. I heard the guy say they won My Nana's salsa competition in 2013, so I look forward to trying that next time on my cheat day Check it out, I love giving my money to local small businesses especially when I see people working hard to create a positive atmosphere. Very nice couple, laid back, positive atmosphere, a little something for everybody and just a fun place to take the kids or grab a bite for lunch."}
{"text":"Found this little gem last Sunday. The people were very nice. A lot of hot dog options and burgers too. I absolutely loved their coleslaw!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for traditional and unique hot dogs and sides.  I ordered the Sonoran dog and it was the best I have ever had.  The Staff had extremely good customer service and cares about what you think.  Great experience here.  The place is very patriotic as well. The owner has two kids in the Marines. 
Semper Fi."}
{"text":"Amazing. Absolutely amazing. 

My love of hotdogs has been fulfilled in this perfect neighborhood joint. They are so incredibly friendly, even going out of their way to give us a sample of their amazing tater tots. 

The menu has a wide selection for everyone, it is a MUST try."}
{"text":"I always order the Carolina.. absolutely love how it's loaded with my favorites; which is macaroni salad and coleslaw. I always get potato salad on the side too. Reminds me of summer BBQ. Luv it!!!
Next time I'm going for pastrami. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I am a supervisor at my place of business and I ordered for a large group of people. 
I found this place on Grub hub and it looked good so we decided to try it out. 
one of my employees wanted to know if they had pastrami fries. I didn't see it on the menu so i decided to ask. I called and spoke with JR. He was very helpful and very accommodating to this large order. I asked about the pastrami fries and even though they do not serve this, he was willing to make this special order. Everyone that ordered stated that the food was phenomenal and the Diablo salsa was really delicious. We will definitely eat at this establishment again and again. Tuesdays are now deemed as Hot Dog Tuesday."}
{"text":"Today I had the Sonoran hot dog combo with pinto beans and cheese. 
The hot dog itself was awesome. All beef, big, good flavor. Not the kind you can get in grocery store. The bun was good. My Sonoran toppings were awesome! Usually, you get bacon wrapped around the hotdog with mayo and salsa over. Not here, everything chopped up including the bacon. It was a huge mess (in a good way). 
The side dish of pinto beans with cheese were simple and delicious. I could just eat those beans for dinner. 
The service was attentive and polite. These are real people, wanting to succeed in what they do.
My only complaint was the Sonoran needed more heat. I told the owner, she said next time just ask....they have a ghost pepper mix they can add if asked for! Wahooo! 
This place is \"expensive\" for a hot dog, but the quality backs up the price. I can see this place getting a cult following with time. 
Can't wait to try out the burgers."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dogs in Arizona. The owner was very helpful and nice. The hot dogs are fresh and very delicious. I definitely recommend this restaunt to everyone who loves hot dogs you will definitely be going back as they have earned us as lifelong customers."}
{"text":"Been awhile since my wife and I have been in decided to stop in again. They sign they have added to front of store looks nice. The food as always delicious. Very friendly customer service and always see them helping new customers with the menu. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Hot Dang! I mean, hot dog! I'm not usually a hotdog fan but even if you're a hot dog hater this place will blow your mind. They take the term \"Gourmet Hot Dogs\" to a whole new level. I got the New Mexico dog which has green chile, salsa, cream cheese, majaca cheese and I forget what else on a very home made tasting bun. Simply amazing!

The dogs themselves are huge too! But the prices are small. They have a great variety as well, many dogs to choose from for every taste and don't forget to try their award winning salsa. Very friendly service too! I was skeptical coming here and they quickly won me over. 

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Owners are great and very friendly. Food is good although I did order the tamales and upgraded to a double however was not impressed with amount you get for what you pay. It seemed as if I ordered a child's plate. All in all, I will go back but just try something different. The prices are still scottsdale prices even though they moved to phoenix."}
{"text":"Outstanding selection of hotdogs! Their sonoran dog is something you'll want to order again -- very tasty and the bread is toasted just right."}
{"text":"This place is OUTSTANDING! I went here with my brother one day to try some Chicago style hotdogs. My parents are from Illinois, and I  was craving a taste of home. When I walked in, we got more than I asked for. The owner answered all of our questions about his business and made some great recommendations for us to try. He made us a sample and it exploded with flavor! I am so happy they finally decided to open a place like this. They have so much to choose from at great prices. I will come back. A MUST TRY hotdog joint!"}
{"text":"Nana Tee's is our family's favorite restaurant! The customer service is always awesome, and is family run so you really get that family feel. Their food is absolutely amazing, and we haven't found a hot dog or side that we don't like. We even had them cater our daughters first birthday party, and were so satisfied! They provided everything we needed to make any kind of loaded dog our party guests wanted, and the price was beyond reasonable! Not to mention their salsa is so good that I ate the leftovers for breakfast for about a week! 100% satisfied with every aspect of Nana Tee's! Favorite dog is the Sonoran and favorite side are the loaded tots, which are extra crispy and delicious on the parts not loaded with liquid cheese!"}
{"text":"WE met the owners at a previous place of business and started talking. They told us they had a hot dog business and where it was. The next day I stopped there for lunch.......best lunch I've had in a long time. A very wide selection of dogs, brats and condiments. You will have to check out their menu. It is as mouth watering as much as their food. I had the Sante Fe Hot Dog. Perfect! I brought my hubby the next day and we both got brats.......OMG....SO GOOD. He loved it, too!  Wonderful staff...family owned and operated. 
Very clean, good hours of operation and enough TV's to watch for entertainment and sports. We will make this place our new \"honey hole\". Thank you Hometown! 
P.S.  GREAT SALSA, TOO!"}
{"text":"This great restaurant is very well kept. I had the opportunity to meet the owners, one being Nana Tee.  They have a great variety from hot dogs that come in many different loaded formations. To different kind of hamburgers to specially made sandwiches. Although for me I enjoyed a great delicious green chile chicken burrito! The environment there was very welcoming for anybody and everybody! I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious all beef hot dogs in lots of varieties! You can also get a burger or a sandwich, we went with the hot dogs!  We also tried the pie and it was fantastic! Will definitely be back to this adorable mom and pop place!"}
{"text":"noticed the sign while I was driving by earlier and love hot dogs so thought id give it a try.
TERRIFIC, people couldn't have been nicer the actually care about the customer experience and very nice  educating a first timer . the food was TERRIFIC.
had a Chicago dog but with a toasted sesame bun with garlic butter that they recommended.
just fantastic, the potato bites, tater tots with cheese and garlic butter were FANTASTIC.
IM definitely going back, and I suspect ill be a regular from this point on."}
{"text":"Tried the stuff mushroom hot dog it was heavenly, that's a real hot dog. Great Customer  service"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food I have had the total and absolute pleasure to enjoy! I have been buying salsa from the owner since she worked in the swap mart on 43rd ave and thunderbird. NOW she and her husband both own this phenominal resturant and the food blows me south of the boarder every time! There's nothing I have even second guessed once when it comes to Tee's food. The home made hand crafted art that this company produces is top of the ladder! Excellent service, salsa, burgers, dogs, hands down, no questions!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  A ton of options and you can build whatever you want out of everything they've got.  I had the New Mexico hot dog on a bollio roll.  I also got Frito pie and broccoli on the side.  Everything was cooked well and had good flavor.  I can't wait to go back and try more things!  They also have pies that you can order.  Haven't picked which one I want to try."}
{"text":"No joke, the best hot dogs that I've ever had! El Guerro Canelo Sonoran hotdogs don't compare, nor has any other Sonoran dog that I've ever eaten. Nana Tee's has the best combination of dogs and is a must try for tubed meat fans."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Love the food, the owners are amazing people, and you can tell they take pride in their business. My favorite thing to get is the New Mexico hot dog with Mac Salad."}
{"text":"I just had in the Sonoran hotdog and it has to be one of the best hotdogs I've had in many many years! Great location plenty of items on the menu go in and say hi to JR tell him Gary sent you"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs, fresh , and delicious. Highly recommended. A hole in the wall you must stop at."}
{"text":"4 solid stars.

Old Quizno's made into a mom and pop hot dog joint. The owners were really cool and the food was good. 

I had a lunch special which is 2 small (regular) sized dogs and up to 4 toppings. I had chili, shredded cheese and mustard. Detroit coney type. They brush the buns with a garlic type buttery spread, on the outside, and sprinkle it with paprika or something. It added a nice touch. 

The chili could have been hotter and the cheese fresh shredded and this would have been 5 stars. easy. 

The combo meal for $5 was well worth it, with a drink and chips. I also sampled the salsa, it was great. Just need to spice it up if you like the heat."}
{"text":"This place is magic. If you ever get a chance to eat here. Congrats. The salsa will change your life."}
{"text":"I have to start this review with a caveat:  I am not a hotdog fan.  Most of my family is, however, so we gave this restaurant a shot.  I wanted to love this place - local business owners making a go at a very complicated hotdog menu - and there are things to love, but they may be trying to do too much at the same time.  Overall our food was decent and the people working there were so very nice and trying so hard to accommodate us, but it probably wasn't good enough to prompt this non-hotdog-lover to try again.  If you like hotdogs and want to try a wide variety of unique variations, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Arizona!  Owners were super nice and let us sample homemade toppings and the soup which were all delicious!  Will go back many many times!"}
{"text":"Loved the dogs. We got the classic, Chicago and a pick your own. They were all great."}
{"text":"It's not just hot dogs at Nana Tees. Anything you can get for a hot dog you can get as a loaded baked potato, and there's loads of custom sandwiches and I think burgers as well. 
Today I had the loaded baked potato version of the Sonoran, with sour cream, a bit of sriracha sauce, a wee bit of onion, and freshly cooked bacon. Mmmm. Bacon!  $7. The price included a drink and great conversation with the very friendly owners. Some 30 toppings available for your dog or potato or sandwich.
Establishment was clean and comfortable with multiple tvs lining the room, and so for the second time in about a week, I find myself in another restaurant with Maury's who's the daddy derby on the telly. 
I didn't think I had much of an appetite, but the potato was good, the hospitality exemplary, and with no survivors left on the plate, I left comfortably full and will go back for more at Nana Tee's."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for an awesome hot dog and then some. The frito pie, the chili and don't forget you can get a huge baked potatoe topped like a specialty dog or whatever else your heart desires.
Everything is fresh (ofcourse) and delicious.
Service is always great, and the desserts........GERMAN CHOCOLATE CHEESE CAKE...OMG. Done deal."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've had. Small homey feel. Plus friendly staff. Can't stop saying good things about this place."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are fantastic and service is great. I love mom and pop shops especially when the owner makes really phenomenal salsa"}
{"text":"Had a polish dog here with sauerkraut, cheese and mustard--wonderful!  A pickle is on top, too, and normally I would hate the taste of a pickle on my dog but this one was great tasting and added something.  These are the best polish dogs I have had in ages.  The bread they use, also, is soft and doesn't break apart like the cheaper breads do on dogs.
Don't know about any sides other than their potato salad which is definitely homemade tasting.  Like it also.
Just a casual joint, nothing fancy, with good prices and wonderful selection of foods to eat--mainly in the hot dog arena.  
They have a variety of foods other than hot dogs, and I did notice they had homemade lemonade for $3.50 which I will try next time I am there.  I did get their ice tea, and the quality of the tea was good and not bitter like most places have.
For some reason, when we went they were totally slammed, so we had to wait quite awhile to eat.  But, luckily, we were not in a hurry or famished so not too much of a problem.  I know every time I looked at the guy making the dogs he was working hard, but they had so many people come in at once I think they were playing alot of catch-up all the time.
However, I would definitely go back here to eat.  I loved the food!"}
{"text":"Good people good service great hot dogs  awesome salsa great burgers and prices are very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Finally a hot dog joint! Great food and service. I had the Kansas City Style dog. Great buns and quality ingredients. Very reasonable pricing. The staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Where do I begin! This place is simply delicious all around :-) hands-down this place has the best hotdogs that I have ever eaten. And I have eaten hotdogs at Ball Parks and at places locally and in different states around the country and this place definitely wins out-not only in flavor but also cost for what you get. Outside of their hotdogs, their salsa is simply amazing and I am totally addicted to it. The ingredients they use, the flavor combinations, and the seasoned hotdog  buns make their  product very tasty and unique. When I stop in-I also always pick up a pint or two of their salsa to keep around the house. We also ordered one of their tasty pies for dessert around the holidays. Specifically we ordered the Mississippi mud pie and it was a hit!

Outside of their food-this place just has a great vibe. The owners are the sweetest most polite that I have met as of recent. They always come out to chat with people in the restaurant and are just simply very nice and hard-working people. I enjoy coming in there whether I'm by myself to pick up an order or with an entire family and always feel welcome. The dining room specifically is over clean and has a great combination of table types whether you're there with one person for a larger group. In addition we truly love the fact that they have several TVs so we can go there eat a great hotdog and watch our favorite sports game. Please try this place and support this business-this is one that you will definitely want to be around for the long haul!"}
{"text":"Nice laid back restaurant. Cashier/cook was nice. Hot dogs were a good size (a little salty). Buns were fresh. My son got a nacho chilli dog. I got the new mexico dog which was good but could care less about the toppings. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was suggested by yelp...and was worth it! My favorite was the Carolina yummtastic!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good hotdog place FOREVER!!! After getting some fliers from a friend, my husband and I stopped in and decided to give it a try. We tried the Wisconsin, Seattle and Detroit Dogs. Everything was SO good. I was stuffed off of just one hotdog. I have absolutely no complaints. I am so happy to find a Seattle Dog too, they are the best! The sauerkraut on the Wisconsin was delish, along with the cheese sauce. Frito pie and tater tots were good too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Owner Tee is great.Home of the Homemade Salsa the best.Great HotDogs of all kinds,burgers.A must to go, everything is homemade"}
{"text":"There's not much to say other than this place has some decent hot dogs with a lot of different options.  The only negatives that I can say we're the tater tots and the speed of the meal.

The fries tasted like your frozen bag tots which are just bland and uninspiring.  In addition, I wish they had cooked the meal quicker.  I love things made to order, but it was a good 20 minutes to get the food, which is a bit too long especially as no one was inside and we're talking hot dogs, not something that would need extended cooking times."}
{"text":"Wow! OK this place is awesome. Found them on yelp and so glad we came over here. I got the Sonoran and the wife got the New Mexico on potatoes. Delicious! We have been looking for a good hotdog and especially a good Sonoran. Jackpot. The staff was great too. So nice and personable. Food came out in a timely manner and we'll definitely be back. Thanks for the great food and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy! First timer, was greeted by the owner, who was sitting by the front door. I mentioned I was a first timer and he wakes me through the entire menu. I ended up getting a pizza burger and tots. Was not disappointed at all, everything was perfect. I also love how it's heavily decorated with U.S Military stuff, something you never see.  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Google Maps showed this place as open till 8pm. Turns out they're permanently closed and didn't bother updating it. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting a Groupon refund."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a whim. Driving down 43rd Ave, I noticed a new sign and thought ?????Hot Dog?!! who does love a good hot dog?

The employees are super friendly. They could see that I was new and trying to figure out what they had to offer, so Tee took a few seconds and explained the menu. I had to try the one I grew up on (Chili, cheese, and onions). While I waited for my order, I noticed that they have a Patty Melt. I told them if I like the dog, I'll be back to try the Patty Melt. Looks like I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Good 'ole Yelp wins again! We are still looking for a good hot dog...we're from the land of Windmill Hot Dogs in Long Branch, NJ....so a review of Yelp brought us here for a late Saturday lunch. We were warmly welcomed by the owner and his family, which includes Nana Tee. We go simple with the dogs, my boyfriend with mustard and sauerkraut, me with just mustard. We were not disappointed. The dogs had a great taste and the rolls were soft with a nice flavor!

My boyfriend enjoyed his potato salad and I really enjoyed the Frito Pie...for future, which is not anything negative, but I'll ask for it sans the scallions next time. 

A funny little thing, but they have great chopped ice for the soda machine!

Finally, took a slice of one of Mama Tee's pie slices home. It was in a graham cracker crust, peanut butter, chocolate and caramel drizzle...YUM!

We'll definitely be back, likely going to try one of the melts or potatos that they are adding to the menu. 

The place was clean. We felt you got what you paid for!"}
{"text":"After reading stellar reviews on multiple sites I talked my husband into giving Nana Tee's a go.

First off I have to say the customer service in this place is excellent. They truly want you to enjoy your experience.

We started off with chips and salsa. A small medium salsa and a small hot. The salsa is extremely fresh with lots of cilantro. We ended up combining the 2 and it was the perfect spice level for us. The only draw back is the chips. They are the average Costco pre packed type. If they made in house chips that in itself would make me go back.

My husband ordered a classic brat with a side of potato bites (tater tots), son ordered a hot dog, ketchup only. I ordered a Philly baked potato, or I should say I wanted a Philly potato..out of potatoes. So I ordered loaded potato bites, I'm not much of a hot dog fan!

Food came out hot and quick.  Husbands brat looked really good, he said it was just and average brat, nothing special. Son said same of the hot dog. My tots (about 12 of them) looked really good smothered in all of that liquid gold cheese and bacon, but they weren't crispy. They were like I make at home when I am too lazy to fry them and I pop in the oven instead.

Overall Nana Tee's was a pleasant local business experience. I want to go back to try the homemade tamales and finally get that baked potato and get some salsa to go!"}
