{"text":"I haven't been here for many years and I was in the neighborhood so I stopped in for lunch. This is one of the very few places that cooks the meat so that the edges are just crisp, exactly the way I like it.  Still one of the best in town."}
{"text":"Fast and phenomenal. This mom and pop shop makes filling and tasty treats that any local should try. They offer a variety of sizes for regular to large to jumbo as well as a 1 pound Gyro. Have a nice menu of a variety of sides and sandwiches made quickly and freshly. The sauce is not as tangy as Joe's at 25th and market but it's better than Gyro world on lorain and appears to be freshly made and not from a container. Overall I cannot say enough and simultaneously my words fail to adequately do it justice. Do not allow the tiny size of the storefront to fool you. Absolutely some of the best takeout in the West Park area"}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly staff, fast yet good quality food. Very clean and food is prepared in front of you. Also, portions are crazy! Got a regular gyro and it was huge! Good job guys"}
{"text":"The best gyros ever. I've been coming here my whole life. Small place, take out only. Super clean and the food is fresh not frozen gyro meat. They make it right in front of you. They also have homemade hummus and grape leaves. The staff is always friendly too."}
{"text":"It has been a couple years since I ate here. Something has changed!!!!  Although the gyros were good it doesn't compare to years past. A few years ago I would have given the place 5 stars.  I would still buy from here but it was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Even though they are well known for their Gyros,  which I admit are great, there Catfish dinner is just as awesome as well as their Corned Beef sandwiches. The side are also good.  The price is right and it Does matter which item I get it has never failed to be Great!"}
{"text":"Real Deal. Awesome gyros grilled to perfection. This is my spot for gyros while in Cleveland"}
{"text":"CARRYOUT ONLY!!!! Very friendly staff.  Great value at a great price. Simply delicious with a hearty helping of gyro meat.  Gyro is cooked on rotisserie right in front of you and not the frozen kind."}
{"text":"I Love this place.  Everything is handmade from gyros to grape leaves.  I highly recommend this place.  I have not had a better gyro.  Great place for grab and go.  No tables."}
{"text":"I been going to this place for well over 10 years and always solid.  Fresh and very reasonable.  They keep it clean and fast.  A great place to grab a gyro and fries.  The steak sandwich is killer!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable value for the quality and size of gyro. Make sure you get extra napkins...you'll need both hands to eat. Worth going out of your way to get one...or three."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick bite while working in the area, and was blown away by the great meal I grabbed to go. I had to work late, and was really craving some greek...this hit the spot perfectly. Would return, very good food and service."}
{"text":"Very good gyros, and fast, friendly service. The gyro is huge and a good value for the price. They have canned drinks and other foods but I've only had the gyro. This place is carryout only."}
{"text":"Love this little hole in the wall. Amazing food, huge portions and the staff is so friendly. Low low prices for great quality. Best gyros in Cleveland. Don't forget to try the baklava too."}
{"text":"I've been eating here about 15 years this is the place for Gyros and they don't cost an arm and a leg . The meat is very nicely seasoned and Ziti sauce is killer . Do you remember how the Gyros in the flats used to taste in the late 80 s well the Gyros here taste alike . I've had some of their other items like the Chicken Gyros, and the chicken Philly. Nothing fancy but a great family business serving quality food for a great price . I order the jumbo Gyro it's so big some of the meat I make an omelette the next day because I can't finish it all . A must try if you like Gyros best in the City and I've had em all over the East and West side you can't top this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious! They have their meat right there in front of you cooking, no pre-sliced frozen gyro meat. They have home made grape leaves and hummus. I've always had fresh tasty food. It's one of my favorite little places to pick up lunch & go."}
