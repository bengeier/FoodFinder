{"text":"Ce restaurant est souvent très occupé. Cependant, ne vous méprenez pas! Ce n'est pas en raison de la qualité de ses repas, mais davantage en raison de son emplacement.   D'abord, nous avons été reçu par un maitre d'hôtel très peu discret sur les erreurs de ses employés quant aux réservations. Quoique il nous a gentiment offert l'apéro en guise de réparation.   Quant à la nourriture, nous avons pris en entrée la soupe de courge et la rillette de canard. La soupe était crémeuse et très bonne. La rillette était également bonne, mais il n'y avait pas suffisamment de craquelin pour l'accompagner.  Quant au repas principal, nous avons pris le tartare de saumon et le Parmentier de canard. Les 2 repas étaient trop salés. La présentation du tartare était particulière et n'ouvrait pas l'appétit.   Le Parmentier est servi dans un ramequin carré et est arrivé sec et semblait réchauffé. Au goût, il était fade et aurait pu être davantage relevé par des fines herbes ou des épices au lieu du sel.  Pour le dessert, et bien autre déception....la crème brûlée que nous avions commandée n'était plus disponible. Eh oui! Une soirée de grande affluence et le chef n'en a pas fait suffisamment (et il n'est que 19h00!!)  Point positif, l'emplacement est chouette et tranquille pour discuter en tête à tête.   Était-ce une expérience horrible? Pas du tout. Reviendrons-nous? Probablement que non!"}
{"text":"Only reason for going to this place is because it's close to place des arts.A perfect pre-concert dinner spot. The food was below average.Grilled octopus used a lot of bizarre dried black flakes(possibly blackberry), which tasted very tart and was way too much on the plate. It over powered the octopus. The octopus was cut into tiny bit pieces so small you cannot get a taste at. Main course was the beef tartare. It came with a half plate of potato chips, came straight from a packaged chips snack you can buy anywhere including a gas station. I know it's a wine bar but come on, you can make some more effort than that. Ordered a glass of wine before ordering food, and the waiter completely forgot. When I reminded him where's my wine after my appetizer has already arrived, he accused me of not ordering. He said he asked me if I want any drinks and I said no. Then I said remember I ordered the Italian white wine BEFORE food? He suddenly remembered now. After a while after serving main courses, the waiters come to the table SEVERAL times try to collect our plates. WE WERE NOT FINISHED FOR GOD'S SAKES! I felt the need to hurry up, so I finished first. They immediately took away my plate and left my friend's because she's not done yet. Naturally she felt the need to rush after mine was taken away. So she rushed to finish. If any of their waiters received proper training, it's a big NO NO. Why on earth do you rush your customers when there's empty seats all over the place? You are suppose to take everyone's plate all at once when everyone has finished. I felt so embarrassed to bring friend to this place. Better go some proper restaurant near by the concert hall next time.   After I submitted my review on bookenda.com, the restaurant choose not to publish it. Instead, sent me an email \" In regard to your critic about our food and service, we would like to make things clearer and answer some of your concerns. Our chef has a lot of experience and our policy is to cook everything from scratch. For what you thought as blackberries are actually olives dehydrated in the oven, as written in the menu. The chips with the tartare are homemade in our kitchen. We serve the octopus sliced thin cause it's a salad and we think all the ingredients in a salad should be the same size. Our team is working hard all the day to assure a good night shift, we are sorry you were disappointed on your visit. About the forgotten glass, we are truly sorry about that and we will speak to our waiter about that and make sure it won't happen anymore. Wishing to see you again at Bar à vin Place Deschamps, Lyne Simard,\"  wow... I just have some questions to ask this 'prestige 3 star Michelin chef' whomever he is:\"have you dined at top restaurants? Have you tasted your food before sending out to the dining room? Can you tell the good/bad difference in food? I don't really care if it's olives or blackberry, it's tart as hell when you put that much. Should change the name to \"black olives' salad\". Go to Ferreira Cafe and try their octopus appetizer and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you've already tasted your octopus salad and you still think it's good, I have nothing to say. No wonder there are so many empty seats around. Good luck with your business.  p.s.Do not trust bookenda.com's review. Only the good ones can be published."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing find! After attending the 2:00 pm presentation of Les Miserables at Place des Arts, my friend and I were in the mood for a quick bite: something a little more upscale than a St. Catherine St. eatery, but a little less pretentious than a white tablecloth venue. What a joy to find Deschamps a hop and skip as you exit PDA. Deschamps offers fancy fare without pretentiousness. The entire staff was witty, helpful and friendly. This place is a wine bar, so my friend was thrilled as he is quite a connaisseur. I'm a vegetarian, and the menu offered a wonderful selection of both vegetarian and meat appetizers and entrees. I had the soup of the day, a perfectly spiced lentil potage, with the goat cheese salad, which consisted of perfectly dressed fresh leafy greens and other finely cut vegetables, atop which rested two chèvre-stuffed philo bundles. I couldn't have been more satisfied. My friend was thrilled with his soup as well, followed by the duck confit with a side salad. I'm not a wine drinker, but I AM a coffee fanatic and Deschamps offered a PERFECT cup of coffee. In fact, although I did not indulge in dessert this time, I'm looking forward to returning for coffee and cheesecake. If their desserts are as scrumptious as their main courses, I'll be in heaven once again. Deschamps is five-star all the way...service, ambiance, food and price."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many poor reviews. A friend and I went here a few weeks ago and had a great experience.   We got there around 8pm or so and the place was pretty empty. However, when we left around 10 there were a lot more people. It's like they all came in at once. We started off with some alcoholic beverages and they were delicious. I had a strawberry mixed drink. It was like an alcoholic smoothie. They came recommended by our server and she was correct. I am a vegetarian so I opted for a broccoli soup and grilled cheese. They were both good. They also gave us multiple servings of bread for no charge. I was very satisfied with both the food and service.   The ambiance is pretty casual. It's kind of an \"open air\" restaurant inside of a chic shopping center. Not really a food court, not an isolated restaurant. They have a large dining area with a separate section with couches/lounge chairs. They also have a separate bar.  The only gripe I have is that the place is not well marked at all. It's in a larger shopping center and there are absolutely no signs at the entrance or any map showing where it is. I guess that isn't the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"Bar a vin I liked their wine lists. There's a lot of choices. They also have signature cocktails that are great and affordable."}
{"text":"Horrible service before going to see show! Buratta was inedible and clams were okay. Chips were only good thing about the meal. Would not recommend and would not return."}
