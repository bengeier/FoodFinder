{"text":"Sliders.  Yummy juicy burgers.  Super friendly staff. Will come back for a second visit when in the area!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. From outside there is no hint of the quality and value found witin. I assumed it would be just another joint where angry old men yell at you if you don't order fast enough or you have questions about the menu (think square boy on the danforth). This was not the case. The place is impeccably clean and the staff is very pleasant. The menu isnt convoluded and pretentious, you will find classic delicious burgers at very reasonable prices. I ordered the classic and a poutine and was not disappointed. Fresh crisp vegitables and juicy delicious meat with that beautiful crispness around the edges. On my next visit i will take some pictures. Take my word for it this place is a hidden gem. FYI they sell beer too so you can have a cold one while waiting for your order. Give this place a try you wont be disappointed, I wasn't and im a cynical jerk who hates everything."}
{"text":"Meh.  Overpriced, small portions, not that great.  Can't believe people still spend money there."}
{"text":"Aayo, so heres the deal.  This place is kinda actin a fool.  There are 3 main faults 1)  They chaarge an exxtra 50cents for cheese PER SLIDER.  2)  They won't give you a free cup of water.  3)  Andd their $4 grilled cheese sandwich did NOT have enough cheese on it.  Plus it was overprised in general.  If I was a new business on Greenn st, I would be charging much less to try to attract more people.    By the way, my guy waalked into their bathrom and saw a gutted cigar in the toilet and weed residue on the sink.  aka people roll blunts in the bathroom.  they do have a good sauce selecion tho"}
{"text":"good place to grab a burger eat it, and get on with your day but to ponder on how wonderful the food you had earlier was. wow. wonderful."}
{"text":"Ok after several visits I have to say this place rocks!  Chili cheese burger, fries onion rings, and the best sliders around!  Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"tl;dr:  Expensive, not very good, they tend to overcharge you if you don't watch your ticket.  I've had them a few times over last semester to try them out, I've been dying for a really good burger joint on campus.  First time I had a burger, fries and a drink.  Totaled over $12.  I found the burger to be over salted and overdone, but the fries were tasty.    Decided to try them again later in the semester, giving them a second chance.  Tried the sliders this time (you know, signature item).  Again, they were way over salted and I found the same thing happened to me as a previous reviewer, I was charged 3x $0.75 for the cheese on them and other prices were higher than the menu board (even 3x $0.50 for cheese is a bit high for slider-sized burgers).  Well, in all I'm sad that there still is no good burger joint on campus."}
{"text":"Mediocre quality food. Tasted fine, but was lukewarm. The fries were cold and I recieved half a cup of fries. Not a good experience at all for over $20. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great burger joint on the Queensway. Burgers are all fresh flame grilled beef, lots of fresh toppings, fries and rings are all very fresh and crispy too. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went today and I'd have to say best burger I have had in a long time. I had the double cheese stacker and it was great!! No wonder this place has great reviews . Juicy burgers the secret sauce  was recommended and totally awesome. Fries were crispy . Will be back with more ppl"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever tried...from the patty, to the buns, to the secret sauce!!! I have a hard time trying burgers elsewhere because I always feel like I'm just going to be disappointed. Bonus, with Sliders new menu, they now have a meatless option!"}
{"text":"Very uninspiring and boring burgers.  Onion rings were the same you'd get at any dingy restaurant.  Tasty but mass produced. Service was OK.  Decor was OK. Lot's of other places to try before returning."}
{"text":"Decided to go to check this place out based on the reviews. I'm glad I went, the burgers were awesome!  I ordered a 4 pack of the bacon cheeseburger and a 2 pack of the classic cheeseburger w/ fries. I waited about 10 minutes for my order. They have a couple of tv's you can watch while you wait for your order to finish. Parking is right beside the store but you have to pay.   I went immediately home after receiving my order. The sliders had 2 patties, tomato, lettuce, diced onions and slider sauce. They tasted delicious! Patty had a nice crust and the meat they used was high quality but what really made the burger was that slider sauce. Even my gf who is extremely picky with food loved it.   I would not hesitate to grab burgers from here again!"}
{"text":"After being in the neighbourhood for a couple of years, we finally decided to drop by for a bite. We had the jerk chicken slider (real chicken breast), the veggie burger and a regular hamburger slider - we were pleasantly surprised! All burgers were really fresh and tasty!  We imagine we will be stopping by for the occasional indulgence!  The owner was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"I live too far away to go here often, and that might be a good thing for my waistline.  Sliders has probably the best burgers in Toronto, and maybe the best fries.  They seemed to have cut some of the topping options on my most recent visit (didn't see any tzatziki there), but still a perfectly cooked patty every time.  The West Coast was great, poutine is amazing.  I'd rate it up there with Nom Nom Nom's in terms of tastiness and authenticity."}
{"text":"If you aren't stopping here for the daily Triple with cheese and Fries deal, you're missing out. The burger is juicy and huge and the fries are crispy and good...for $6.50!  $6.50!!!  It's worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Sliders a couple times, and it's definitely one of the best burger joints in the west end. The sliders are a lot bigger than I expected, two will definitely fill you up! They're pretty tasty as well, especially the Swiss & Mushroom slider.   The side order of fries are pretty generous as well, although the quality of the potatoes were hit and miss - the first time we visited, my boyfriend and I ended up with fries with a lot of black spots on them. On our second visit, we thought we'd give them another try and they were fine."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of burgers or sliders, but this place impressed me. Sliders and fries were great, good prices, and awesome customer service from the store owners. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Awesome place quality burgers no filler or cheats in the meat. Great chipolte sauce that can be used on burgers or fries. I like the classic burgers best the caramalized onions make the burger sing to you. Staff and owner quite friendly"}
{"text":"Driving down the Queensway I had a hankering. One of those low blood sugar - I'm getting really PISSED off at everything hankerings. I wanted something better than Harvey's. It was this or Apache Burger.   Was concerned that it was dead empty, that the lady behind the counter didn't have the \"greatest\" grasp of English, and the ultra Christ-y pictures of Jesus behind the counter.   Well sometimes low expectations are a good thing.  Had two orders of a Slider special with fries (mini burger) for $2.49 each. That's it! They didn't even look that good. Got the \"Slider Sauce\" on those bastards. It was a smoky mayo.  I loved these burgers. Crispy, charcoaly. Not overdone. I'm going to go back for a big mother. They had lots of greasy breakfast options, are open late, and serve booze ($4.75 a bottle for domestic)- as Leeor J. notes.   Thought to myself, who the heck comes in here to drink? Well then a scraggly-ass old guy walked in from across the street at the House of Lancaster peeler club. Makes sense. Who wants overpriced burgers from a strip-club? Just walk across the road (note: I'm only assuming the burgers are overpriced at the House of Lancaster: Foxes Den).  Is this place a chain? I don't know. It looks like it. Are the burgers from frozen like some dude down here wrote? Well I don't know. But they were good."}
{"text":"Exactement ce qu'un restaurant Hamburger style 'Diner' devrait être : accueillant, propre, un personnel qui s'y connaît, un service excellent et un menu varié avec un très bon rapport qualité prix.   Les 'sliders' - ces petits hamburger miniatures sont très populaires aux États-Unis comme au Canada : on en fait souvent une ou deux bouchées !   Et si les hamburger ne vous plaisent pas ou ne plaisent pas à votre compagne ou votre compagnon, alors ne vous inquiétez pas, on peut passer commande pour une omelette en soirée sans hésiter."}
{"text":"I'm always down to try new places when they so I came here despite what I had already heard from my friends. Turns out, pretty much everything they said was true, and sadly none of it was good.  First is that it's overpriced. 2 dollars for a burger, another 2 for fries, and another 2 for drinks. They don't have combo meals. I ended up asking if they had any specials and the girl told me it's buy one get one free for the burger so I got 2 burgers, small fries, and a small drink. Came out being $10.80. Yea, I'm as confused as you are. Asked the lady how that works, she flashed my receipt at me and said it was taken off. Wouldn't even let me look at my own receipt and didn't get it when they gave me my order. That right there is a big no no.  As for the food, it wasn't all that good either. the burgers were alright, but like some of these other reviews, you can get a much better burger with more stuff on it for about the same price or cheaper at other fast food places. The fries were average. They were made fresh for me at least so that's one good thing about this place. And they do have a big sauce collection but i mean, it's mostly the basics like ketchup, mustard, bbq etc.   The actual store is kinda dirty looking. They have like 4 tables when there's so much more space that they can use. Definitely not efficient.  They have TVs but they were not on, so not really sure what the point of that is. Don't think I'll be coming back here anymore and don't suggest others do until they fix their prices."}
{"text":"HIDEOUS is the best word I have to describe this establishment. It would have been worse if I had spotted a health code violation but no, instead I call fraud and misrepresentation on the whole concept and its cost.  I paid $11.63 for three sliders topped with grilled onions, pickle, ketchup, mustard and American cheese and a medium Belgium fries. I could have gotten a bigger and tastier meal in the form of one double-deluxe bacon butter burger value basket from Culver's for $3 less and more ingredients!  Sliders: Not better quality than a fast food chain. And they charged me extra for cheese and toppings. I call bogus.  Fries: The only slightly saving grace in that these were cut like a Belgian fry and were tasty, but too salty and doused in oil to be accurate. (I've been to Belgium, I know). HOWEVER, they ran out of garlic mayonnaise, the quintessential topping to Belgian fries.  So I tried the regular mayo.  BIG MISTAKE. The regular mayo does not taste like Belgian mayo. It's regular sandwich mayo. Gross.  I also tried the honey mustard and fry sauce also in hopes that I could find something good about Sliders. Nope.  This place was packed with undergrads loading up on food before drinking the night away. It's cramped, greasy and I nearly turned around and did not order. I wish I went with my gut instinct.  Fail."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is the bomb for burgers! I ate here almost everyday for a week while I was staying down the road from here. I usually ordered the mini burger sliders with bacon and they were darn great! Then one day, I ordered the hotdog and It was amazingly scrumptious! Nice friendly young staff and very clean appearance. I would eat here again 4sure!"}
{"text":"Not much to recommend this place. The burger and fries were basically average, and the Greek salad was soggy and bland. I didn't have the heart to be honest with the earnest cashier, but those are the facts. Not coming back in a hurry, as in 'ever'."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Sliders twice and both times I was really disappointed.  The first time, they screwed up my order -- twice. I was let down by the menu to begin with, since one of the best parts of Belgian fries is the sauces, but for the most part their selections are very ordinary: plain ketchup, BBQ, hot sauce, etc. Between my friends and I, we ordered burgers/sliders (which were just decent), fries, a number of different sauces so we'd have variety despite the options being quite ordinary, and were delivered a completely different selection of sauces than what we had ordered. I called Sliders to request that they deliver the correct sauces and they delivered a bag *with our order correctly handwritten on it* yet with another seemingly random collection of incorrect sauces inside! We gave up. The fries were bland and oily anyway and bore little resemblance to authentic Belgian fries I've eaten in the past.  The second time, I tried to give Sliders another chance by ordering a burger and a slider -- since the burger had been the only decent component of my meal the first time -- and it was awful. The bottom of the burger was not only sort of charred, but absurdly, horribly salty. I *love* salt but I found this barely edible. A burger this bad from a cheap burger place wouldn't be as disappointing, but this was $5 to start plus they charge you extra for cheese and some other toppings (including the jalapenos, which were not very good jalapenos -- all heat, no flavor). The slider was a little better but nothing special, and seemed more like a tiny burger than a proper slider anyway. Overall, too much money for really lousy food."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, very nice staff. That is where my compliments end. I spent $21.10 on 2 slider burgers, fries, and a shake. The meat was dry, nothing special. Fries were so disappointing. Cold and doused in some salty crappy seasoning. The oreo shake was okay, but not worth the $7. I could have got the same thing at Harveys for $4..and considering it's a couple of cookies, milk, and ice cream it was far to overpriced  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Before I visited Sliders I had been so disappointed in burgers around GTA in general that I stopped even trying to find any new places well over a year ago. But what do you know, there's life on Mars!   Out of four different sliders (the classic one, the mushroom-spiked version of the latter, the parmesan cheese chicken and the spicy jerky chicken) I tried during my first but definitely not last visit I'd have to call the mushroom version a winner, though they were all pretty awesome.  The specialty spicy sauce went very well with the beef burgers, and tzatziki is just what you need to cut through the spicy chicken. The chilli & cheese fries didn't disappoint either, and the size of a large potion simply blew my mind (beware, it's humongous and it has lots of beans to boot). On top of all that goodness the place sells beers and it's open till midnight (always the time I have the worst cravings). I mean what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Quick Review:  I showed up for lunch, ordered the classic burger, the burger was put together nicely, toasted buns, two ( thin ) patties, lettuce, tomato, onion, and their special sauce called the \"slider sauce\" (mayo based and no lactose in it) Yay!   Before I went there, I thought for some reason that they only served slider size burgers, but actually they serve regular, slider, chicken and hot dogs. So whatever tickles your fancy, they got it..  Ok Now let me sum it up  Customer service 5/5 Taste 4/5 Quality 4/5 Value 5/5  Overall I would definitely return if I am in the neighborhood   PS. When I said 2 thin Patties, it was not a negative thing for me, I think they split the 4oz or 6oz burger in two, so the burger would have a double meat effect.  Keep on Yelpin****"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot dog to eat in the restaurant.  Hot dog came out spilt in half, over-cooked, dry and cold.  I complained, but the staff, who could not speak English very well, did not care at all!  I will never go back!  The milshake was SO thick that it could not make it up the straw and the cheap chocolate syrup was not even propserly mixed yet.  Very upsetting!  Never again!"}
{"text":"BEER WITH MY FAST FOOD! Need I say more??? Actually I can say, BEER WITH MY VERY GOOD FAST FOOD!   Finally, I have stepped foot into Sliders and thank goodness because it was one of the most satisfying lunches ever! The meat in the sliders is top notch. The portion of the Greek fries was huge (you have to share with at least another person) and delicious. Additionally, choosing a beer instead of the typical pop was an awesome joyful option. And the customer service was friendly too!  Sliders, I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"There is no way to look pretty when eating these burgers... They are so delicious!  I stopped by before my resolution kicks in and I'm so glad that I did.  I tried their new west coast style burger and would highly recommend it!  The thin fresh cut fries are also delicious but it's hard to go wrong with fries.  I was really tempted to try the Oreo cookie milkshake as well but I'll save that for next time.  Really great neighbourhood joint, very stylish, clean and the staff is really friendly too."}
{"text":"Sliders is the best burger joint by far in Toronto. Awesome burgers, fantastic fries and yummy onion rings. I find it a bit pricey, that is until you get your order and see what you are getting for your money."}
{"text":"This is my guilty pleasure.  After teaching a bootcamp class, I come here and indulge in those tiny perfect Black and Blue sliders, which I take with extra blue cheese and nothing more but the special sauce.  Great flavour and juicy patty inspite of its size.  The meat is iencased in a yielding sesame seed bun. which is fresh.  Also they have free wifi so you can blog about how badly you have sinned at this place, like I do when I also get the fries with chili and cheese or the onion rings on the side.  Sigh.  I think I am going to go right now and get all of them!"}
{"text":"My son and i were driving by and spotted this place, and a quick round the block later we were parked on the street outside.  It has a retro feel, but a very modern product.  The staff is very friendly and accomodating.  We both had the stacked sliders with cheese and bacon.  These were tasty and juicy and everything a burger should be on a toasted bun.  Its a great place to go with kids, actually we both enjoyed it and will return in the near future.  But even better than the sliders were the milkshakes.  Its been a long time since i have had one that good, so even just to beat the summer heat i would return for a milkshake and hang out and watch basketball on the their TV.  I had no idea what to expect when we walked in but certainly left with a good impression, the vibe here is one that says welcome"}
{"text":"After hitting my first library I stopped for lunch, making this stop 2  and this was close to corner of queenway and royal york, since i was heading south on york after this was on my way,  So i had double bacon and cheese which was two 4 oz patties it was semi filling  food but given I had plans on eating again. It was tasty and juicy,came out pretty quick, I had with fries and drink and for 12 buck for 8oz combo wasnt terrible. It wasnt anything special but it was good  Just have to knock it down because the  slider sauce which is their signature sauce  was too runny and dripped everwhere i think more ended up on my tray then on burger, as well it wasnt that great of a sauce which isnt good since they put this sauce on everything.  Meh probably wont be back... the sauce is disappointing and burger isnt anything special.   As well, the bathroom was a mess, two urinal were out of order and toilet was a mess, come on that just terrible for  anyone to use a dirty and unfunctional washroom."}
{"text":"This place isn't much to look at; the décor is kind of blasé, stock photos adorn the walls, hard seats, minimalist to be sure, bordering on cold...and too bright! I had to squint for a solid 10 minutes when I walked in.  That all said, I do plan to go back. Multiple times. The food is simply fantastic. Little bundles of joyous burgers. Delightful. Tasty. Sauced perfectly. Seriously: a four pack and two fries for under $20!? You couldn't get out of McDonald's these days for that little - feeding two normal adults.  You have a craving for a bacon double cheeseburger and fries - hit Sliders up - you'll be more than satisfied. Guaranteed. Just take your sunglasses."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at Sliders a few nights ago and all I can say is FANTASTIC burgers!! We live in Etobicoke and we've been to all the local joints (Apache, Magoo's, ACME, South St. Burgers, C Dubbs) and I have to say we've found our new fav. place for great food!   We both got 2 sliders (my friend chose the mushroom-swiss, and I picked black 'n' blue which is spicy peppery with blue-cheese) and let me say neither of our choices lacked in flavour!   2 sliders each was more than filling and did not disappoint.  Delious beef and their fries are double-fried (the only way to have french fries)!  5 Stars = will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Fries and patties are home made so the taste is authentic and rich. In fact you don't get that aweful feeling you get after you eat a heavy meal. Milkshakes are recommended and the service is good. Will come back hte again."}
{"text":"As I write this review I'm actually sitting in Sliders having my lunch.  It's one of the newer entries into the burgeoning burger market in the big smoke.  They offer up WiFi here at the shop which is cool so I can partake of my lunch and still do some online stuff.    At first Sliders struck me as being another version of Acme or Hero Burger but I'm delighted to say that I'm wrong.  It is actually pretty damn decent.  I ordered up a two pack of sliders with bacon & cheese and a small side order of fries.  This set me back $7.40 (tax included) but I have to say that for sliders these are pretty good sized little burgers.  The patties are hand made and fresh.  They use real cheddar not those edible oil orange slices.  Big points for that.  The bacon is well cooked.  They call you up when your burgers are ready and you finish it off with toppings.  There is no frou frou here.  It's pretty basic stuff and I'm ok with this.  After all, I came here to eat meat.  It doesn't have to be pretty just as long as it's tasty and fresh.    The fries are fresh cut and well cooked.  For a small side it is a substantial amount of spuds and is quite filling.  Eating in here is pleasant, it's clean, bright and friendly considering this is probably really geared to takeout.  If you are eating in they plate the food.  The gal behind the counter came over to me after I sat down and offered me metal utensils.  I just heard her call out after a customer as they were leaving to drive carefully.  All this and a decent burger.  Oh by the way, the tunes overhead are rocking pretty good too.    The menu is also quite a bit larger than what I expected offering lots of breakfast sandwiches and signature burgers.  Prices for burgs run around $5.00-$7.00 with combo options for another three dollars.  So it's your basic ten buck burger/fries/drink purchase.  The burgers are decent, really decent and this is a surprisingly great little addition to the desert along the Queensway.  I'll be back....I can hear the whirring of the milkshake machine.... it's calling my name....  Quick Edit:  Note - Right now they accept CASH only.  One other small deet I forgot to mention....they are licensed so you can have a beer with that burger!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted a great Burger place. We tried many different burger places and this is defiantly up there .  Awesome Burger overall. My wife had the Sliders. Perfect size for her . Lol  I had the Bacon and Cheese double. awesome !"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to drop in for lunch this afternoon. After a sweaty workout I decided to treat myself to a burger and ended up with a two cheeseburger slider combo.   Like other reviews here...it was very good. The sliders were hot, nicely browned and the buns were very fresh and the right size. At the garnish station I knew to ask for slider sauce, which had a nice kick and complimented the meat.   The portion of fries was too large for me (why is that the norm these days?)...and I would have preferred them crisper, but overall they were good. I'm really picky about fries...  If I lived closer I would be a regular...and bet the breakfast is good as well."}
{"text":"Easily the closest you can get to In-N-Out in Canada. Their \"West Coast\" Burger is essentially In-N-Out's \"Animal Style\" (i.e. fried in mustard, grilled onions, special sauce) and they also have \"West Coast\" Fries which are very close to the Animal Style fries you can get at In-N-Out (they're smothered in cheese, topped with onions and doused in special sauce).  Went here after a few mediocre experiences at Burger's Priest and will definitely come back. The price/value ratio is pretty awesome. Huge portions of fries, and the burgers are extremely filling and delicious. Honestly, this might be the best burger I've had since I was in California a few years ago.  The only negative here is location. In the middle of Etobicoke, it's not somewhere many people would see walking by, and downtown-dwellers wouldn't likely take the 45min public transit trip just for some fast food, no matter how good it is. THAT BEING SAID, anyone with a car considering the drive - it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I liked it, the couple times I've been here.  Not too expensive, and the sliders come in sets of 2, 4, or 6  Order a 4 pack with fries and there is no way you'll finish it..  if you do, you definitely won't be hungry.  It's a feast.  Plus its nice being able to customize 4 burgers 4 different ways.  If I lived closer, I'd eat here often"}
{"text":"Holy eff. This is probably the best burger I've ever had. And I'm not an easy girl to please!   My boyfriend mentioned passing this place during the 'long way' home from work one Friday night.   We got into his car around 8pm, and drove all the way to Etobicoke - living downtown (King/Brant), we felt like slight traitors, traveling to the 'other' end of the city ... but my lord! It was worth it!   The sliders, and tiny perfect little things of perfection ... the fries don't disappoint & even the onion rings are spot on. Neither were soggy messes by the time we got home.    I did push the envelope on this one, and even tried a homemade chocolate shake, that left me moaning .. and my boyfriend wondering what the hell he had just ordered for me!   While one of the owners (I asked him, who he was) looks like a total Jersey Shore douche bag, this dude sure can deliver on a good burger & fries!  I'll be going back to Sliders. No doubt, yo!"}
{"text":"The food and service at Sliders is outstanding!  The portions are very large for the price that you pay.  I usually get a burger combo with poutine and a shake, and I always leave satisfied, and with leftovers to take home.  The service is quick and friendly.  If you're looking for a casual dinner in a classic diner atmosphere, Sliders is the best choice in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My girlfriend seen some pictures of the hamburgers at this place. It looked really good. It reminded us of an in-n-out burger. It looked really juicy and delicious and we just had to go and try it.  We drove by this place many times on the Queensway and every time we're like \"we got to try this place\".  We finally went and it was not a disappointment. We both ordered a stacker with grilled onions and one with onion rings and the other was fries. The burger was as good as it looked. It kind of reminded me of 5guys. The onion rings were nothing special but the fries and gravy was terrific. I do not like fries but these fries were tasty and addicting. They were homemade shoestring fries and it tasted like it was twice fried. My girl and I couldn't stop eating them. The owner was a great guy. He came and asked if everything was okay. I told him the food was awesome. That put a smile on his face like I know it would.  Great food and great customer service. I recommend this place to all burger lovers. You got to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Seemed pretty pricey to me for what you got.....burgers tasted pretty flavorless....fries were good with their fry sauce...$8 for two little burgers some fries and a small drink..will not go back...I was excited when I seen this place...dissapointed"}
{"text":"Very good ,solid coowner Tom = pure nice guy . Clean. Good flavour.Recc. the Sliders.Will return.Slider Sauce is a keeper"}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  Cooked perfectly, juicy, not messy.  Buns fresh and toasted (this is a plus for me).  Fries nicely done as well.  It's always a plus when you find a good burger place that also pays attention to the fries. Tried the 2 pak sliders, wasn't sure if that was going to be enough, but it was enough.  pleasantly filling.  Got the pak so I could get different topping on each, just to be difficult I suppose.  Great for when you can't decide.  Small place but with pretty decent seating.  Parking is metered, but across the street is a large parking lot for the House of Lancaster.. Service was excellent.    Good stuff."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of this restaurant. Sliders and fries are cool and I'm glad to have them accessible on campus. They're very tasty too. On the same token, the prices are kind of high for a campus restaurant. Not sure I can afford to spring 10 dollars for 3 sliders and fries without a drink. Also, the service was a bit on the slow side but my guess is that this will get better as the restaurant matures."}
{"text":"When I moved to Mimico one thing I thought I was going to miss was all the amazing food from downtown. Boy was I wrong!  It all started today when a friend of mine tagged me in one of Slider's Facebook posts. It was a picture of one of their burgers and I knew immediately I needed to try this place. I'd driven by many times before but thought all they sold was sliders because of the name and the look didn't really draw me in either. In fact I don't really like the look of the place, but who cares how a place looks if the food is good.  I decided to try their West Coast Style 2 Patty burger after reading reviews here with fries. I tried the fries first and while I loved that they were thin cut I was really hoping they would be a bit crispier. But after all, I wasn't here for fries, I was here to try the burger.   On first bite I knew this was something special. The flavour was amazing as the burger is cooked in mustard and the Patty was seasoned perfectly. The sauces and other ingredients really brought everything together making it juicy, a little messy but damn delicious! Everything I want in a burger.  This place is definitely worth a trip and it is my new favourite burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and finally went in for lunch. My excitement for sharing a mix and match slider meal with my niece was quickly squashed as one of the sliders offered on the menu, was not available.  This could have been overlooked if the service was not so bad.  We had a table of 6 and our food was slowly delivered over the course of 40 minutes and in random order.  We had to ask several times for components of our meal giving us the sense that they had not accurately recorded the order.   In terms of quality, I would say, the sliders we make at home were better.  The food was nothing to write home about but something that needed to be shared here."}
{"text":"This is my goto burger place in Toronto. I love all the different kinds they have: classic, mushroom-swiss, jerk chicken, chicken parmesan (i know that sounds weird, but its good!). and all the burgers have that charbroiled taste. plus they serve beer. plus they're open til midnight. sweet."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with Christine C... I'd been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant ever since I saw the bright red sign show up a couple months ago, couldn't be happier that it didn't disapoint. This place is a great new addition to my neighbourhood. After my dinner there today, I've decided I'll be going here at last a couple times a month, and definitely weekly once the summer comes around. Tried the cheese burger, messy but yummy, and a couple bites of the philly cheese steak(not the best cheese steak I've had, but much better then you'd expect from a burger joint)  Going to return and try out the breakfast,  the milkshakes, and many of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I have to say, very decent fast food burger. The sliders aren't quite as good as the full size burger, though."}
{"text":"You can practically smell the Abercrombie and Fitch cologne and hear the sound of collars popping as you enter this place. Douche central.  Food was decent, but it took 15 minutes for them to make 3 sliders to go. They advertise these fancy dipping sauces but they were out of everything except ketchup -- how exotic. Prices are also outrageous -- $14 for 3 tiny sliders and a small fry.  I will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Good tasting burgers but these are diner type burgers and not really gourmet fare. Kids loved the fries too. Sliders are small enough that a Hungary adult could eat 4."}
{"text":"I don't know why people said so many bad things about this place. I accidentally ended up at this place. 6 sliders of reasonably big size were about 10.xy$. The sliders were yummy! Don't know if they improved their quality or I was lucky!"}
{"text":"Burgers & fries here are quality made. Presentation kinda reminds me of In & Out in the states. Pictures are cool, but try it & see for yourself. West coast style burger & spicy chipotle fries are my go to"}
