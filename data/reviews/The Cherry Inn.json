{"text":"Cherry Inn has been our \"go-to\" Chinese take out joint for as far back as I can remember. It's a family run business, and owner Yen always has a warm smile and handshake at the ready for customers.

The restaurant is small and usually crowded, particularly on weekends. Just entering can be a challenge at peak times with people waiting to be seated and others retrieving their take out orders. In spite of the chaos one meets at the entrance, the staff is quick to seat you. Tables are very closely nestled together so if it's intimate dinner conversation you want, this isn't the place for you. Service is quick and efficient. Dishes arrive hot and in quick succession.

The food is generally very good, both eat in and take out, but sometimes suffers from a lack of consistency. For example, I've had excellent Ginger Beef there, but I've also had it where it's been tough and chewy. Overall though, I've been hard-pressed to find Chinese food that I like better, particularly close to home."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. They are able to do all their main dishes without any msg which is great as I'm allergic. Their portions on the meal for one are huge. Try the salt and pepper squid!"}
{"text":"Chicken ball tastes like flour and spring roll taste like flour and been sprout. Safeway makes better spring rolls than that"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are reasonably. The only thing that is the same between Chinese food in the west and in the east is deep fried chicken balls. Delivery was fast and portions are large."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years!  I guess I must love it.  It definitely satisfies my Chinese food cravings when they sneak up on me.  Egg rolls. Noodles. Chicken or beef dishes. All sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"While the food is great here - they recently cut the size of of the main dishes by cleverly changing the packaging - you now get a little less then you use to get - keep this in mind.  Still great quality though!"}
{"text":"Been going to Cherry Inn for years now. They've always been good but I think they are even better than before.  If you want western Chinese food this is your place! It's nice they can make it without msg if you request it and I find it doesn't alter the taste at all.  Only thing is they changed their packaging for some items so you get a little less (ie ginger beef). Hopefully nothing else gets slashed. But I still recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for 30 years! Best takeout ever.  They'll even make their food without MSG if you request it."}
{"text":"I like this place when I go for lunch and am craving a westernized Chinese food meal..  You get all the westernized classics here.   They are fast and efficient and it is all good."}
{"text":"I've lived near this place forever... and have finally set foot in here for a meal!

This restaurant is quite cozy, and was quite full during the duration of our meal. If you're looking for western style Chinese food, this is a great place to go. The staff speak English quite well, and there was even a hockey game playing during our meal. 

the menu is straight forward, and has all the classic items one might expect. We loved their chicken sizzling rice, and sweet & sour pork chops. The mixed meat hot pot was fantastic, and very boiling hot. The portion sizes are fair to their price and service was very fast even with a full restaurant. We ordered two appetizers, two rice entrees and three main entrees between the six of us and the bill only came up to $16 per person including tip.

If you're looking for western style Chinese food, I'm sure this would be a good place to hit up for both take out and dine in."}
{"text":"This place has always been a family favourite. We've tried several other places and if your going to pay for Chinese food you might as well know it is good food. We always end up back here. Lunch special you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"If your looking for a nice small place and western style chinese food then this is the place.  It's a very small place but gets busy.  The menu is straight forward and you will find lots of familiar items like ginger beef.  The service staff are very nice and attentive and the food come out quickly and hot.  It was a great place for satifying the chinease food hunger pain.  My only reason for three stars is because I was hoping for an option for genuine chinese food menu option.  
Overall a great little place that is tucked away off 64th ave."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese take out in Calgary.  I love the ginger beef, chicken fried rice, beef and broc,  and their deep fried wings are so so good.  You should try it!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for quite a few years and am a fan. Food is great, service is fast and the family run nature of the place makes service pretty first rate. The won ton soup tastes great, also check out the chicken wings, ginger beef and lemon chicken. Fried rice is a good bet. Their prices are very fair and the lunch deal is great. I think it is $10. Sometimes tough to find a table as this place is small and relatively popular so that is the only real drawback."}
{"text":"It has been literally years since I have had Chinese food.  I have had enough bad experiences that I had shunned them from ingestion.  After reading some stellar reviews I decided to break my streak and give the Cherry Inn a try.

I will admit the service is quick and the owners are nice people.  BUT the place is kind of dingy and run down and I can't stand a restaurant with carpeting which harbours mould, mildew, fungus, you get the picture.

The food itself was alright for westernized Chinese fare.  I hated the gingered beef, I found that it was not crispy enough, too chewy and the sweet to sour ratio was a bit off... and that for leftovers the next day tasted rancid.  The beef and broccoli was very good and I loved the beef chow fan noodles, albeit a bit too greasy for my liking, hit the spot for decent Chinese grub.  We also tried the chicken with veg and found there was way too much bok choy which I am not a fan of but the dish itself was decent, nothing to rave about.

Would I go to the Cherry Inn again? Maybe, if I have a huge hankering for it I would stick to the food that isn't battered and deep fried, the wok fried versions were way better and were good for leftovers."}
{"text":"family owned restaurant. my friend Gail brought me here. service is quick. great price. its a cozy resto...hard to find parking though since it is surrounded by different establishments (on lunch hour). great price. its a good authentic chinese /western catered restaurant."}
