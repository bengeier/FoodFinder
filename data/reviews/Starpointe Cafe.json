{"text":"Such nice folks, love the Cuban sandwich! 
Owners are super nice. Best place to order food when pool side at Starpointe. 
They also have great salads and a kid's menu. Big burgers and not overpriced. 
You can even get Popsicles for the hot summer days!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. 
Will return soon."}
{"text":"Came here while being at the pool and was hungry! I got a hotdog and a soda and my son got the burger. Took a long time to get our food from the time we ordered. The staff was very nice but thought the food was a little over priced for the flavor or lack there of. Will try this place again though."}
{"text":"The Cuban Sandwich is very good!  They do not skimp on portions either. Chicken Sandwich is huge.  :)

This small hidden gem located inside of the Estrella Community Residence center is wonderful. Yummy eats with the familiar feeling of homemade. They are closed on Mondays and do not open until noon all other days. I love this place, the food and it also gives me the opportunity to support a small locally owned business.  :)"}
