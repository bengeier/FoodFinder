{"text":"Fish and chips here are the best.  As good and look the same as Yorke Fish and Chips on Laird Drive.  If you want to dine in you have to go in the middle of the afternoon.  There are only 3 tables.  If you make the mistake of going at 6:30pm and think you can dine in like I did, another problem pops up.  The owner, a very nice man, prioritizes the orders that have been phoned in.  He actually gets panic stricken about it.  He will let you sit there until it gets quiet.  I waited 45 minutes for my one order.  No problem, I'm retired and the food is really good.  During the summer time you can get a takeout and eat in the park just to the east."}
{"text":"Which Fish and Chips is the best in Toronto is one of those things that will be argued for a millennium but I prefer to say \"It depends what type of Fish and Chips I'm in the mood for and how far do I want to go.\" Do I want the almost tempura like batter from Reliable, do I want the thick, not crisp but truly crunchy batter of Harbord etc etc....
I have not even began to talk about the chips, thick or thin, level of crispness etc etc.................

When I'm in the mood for a relatively thin and crisp batter and really tasty fries I call ahead for a pick up and head over to British Style.  I have only ever had the Halibut and Chips and have found it above average but a little inconsistent.  For the most part it has been not excessively greasy, well cooked and quite tasty.  I have gotten fish that was overcooked and greasy but they were extremely busy both times so I tend to forgive them these 2 discretions, plus as someone said maybe the oil was in dire need of changing, who knows but I've received more good than bad so I continue to go. 

TIP : If you are going to call ahead for a pick-up try and get there on time. The one time I got there about 10 minutes too late the fish had been sitting in the bag, tightly wrapped up and by the time I got home the fish had been sitting in the bag steaming for about 20 minutes and the batter had lost most of it's crispness and the fish continued to cook in the hot steamy bag.
That was not a good F&C dinner, overcooked fish and steamed batter, but I think it was my fault.
(unless it was overcooked to begin with but I won't blame them for that cause I don't know)"}
{"text":"By far the best Fish and Chips I have had in Toronto.  For the person who commented on the greasy staff and depressing ambiance...It is a fish and chip shop not a 5 star restaurant. The man who cooks the fish is the man who owns it and he works everyday. The woman who cashes you out also works almost everyday and works hard based on the amount of people who go in and out. It is a take out place so I would rather he save the money on decor and put it into the amazing Fish, Fries and gravy they make. 

To the man who commented on the mass produced tartar sauce not helping...They let you take as many of those packs as you want. This is unlike some places that charge for tartar sauce whether its homemade or not. I for one like that brand."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great batter on their fish. Nice and crispy with a large helping of fries. 

This tiny hole-in-the-wall has limited seating (~10 seats). Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Was driving from client to client and found this place. My son and I had the haddock and fries. I'm sure glad we stopped here and not mcd's. Service is fast and friendly, food is excellent. Prices are great also.  2 haddock and fries was just under $20. Highly rec"}
{"text":"This place looks sketchy, but the fish they are serving up is delish. Greasy, yet light and flaky. The chips are pretty good too.

I think this place changed owners or something. A few years ago, it was written up everywhere, and they even deep-fried Mars bars and had amazing homemade tarter sauce. Don't think they do that anymore, but thankfully the taste of the fish and chips has stayed the same."}
{"text":"I ventured in mid week shortly after 6pm. There were a few people eating in and I noticed many came for takeout. 

So I put my order in. While I was waiting, more people came in for pickup or they would get calls for pickup.

Eventually, there was 5 other people waiting. I got my order within 15-20 minutes. 

The pollock was ok for $5.99. It was on special. It was very doughy and lacked flavour. The haddock on the other hand was very good and only $1 more.

The Handcut fries were soft, moist, fresh and delicious. 

They offered ketchup, tartar sauce, white vinegar, malt vinegar for self serve in packets on the counter. 

I would definitely order from there again. The halibut was priced at around $10.50 so will have to try it next time."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here is great.  I always go for the halibut (for the helluvit) and chips, large portion of both.  Very tasty and very reasonably priced.  The owner is nice.  Dining at one of the three tables isn't ideal, but call ahead for take away.  Pro tip: Ask for the homemade tartar.  Lemon wedges also available on request."}
{"text":"Definitely the best fish and chips in Toronto. Maybe even the GTA. It looks quite shady but there is a police station across the street so it is really safe. It does get busy but you can phone ahead and place your order which is a really good idea if you don't want to wait too long."}
{"text":"A small mom-and-pop type place on Coxwell Avenue. There is a small amount of seating, and you can see the kitchen where they are preparing your food (if that is an issue for you). It isn't a fancy place, but the owner was friendly and served me promptly.

I had the pollock and chips, and the generous portion surprised me for the $5.99 price. I'm not a fish aficionado, but the pollock was tasty and had a smooth, creamy texture. The batter was light and crispy, and had a clean, mild flavour (sometimes if the oil isn't changed frequently you can taste it in the batter). The fries were delicious, and appear to be cooked in lard (if you remember the flavour of fries cooked in lard and not vegetable oil). The condiments are self-serve, so you can take as much as you like (some places tend to be stingy with tartar sauce).

The prices were very competitive, my food was fresh, hot and tasty, and the restaurant (while not elegant) was clean and well-maintained, so I recommend this place as an excellent value. Oh, and there are a lot of advertisements in the restaurant for Atomy cosmetics and supplements :-)"}
{"text":"My first priority when seeking out good fish and chips , is of course a nearby police station.
BSF&C succeed on both counts.To know my safety is assured as I douse my malt vinegared fish in tarter sauce , just adds to the overwhelming sense of well being this place provides."}
{"text":"Small Fish & Chip joint. Seating for 10. Mostly takeout. Good fish and chips for under $10"}
{"text":"I am not a fish eater, but I LOVE Halibut & Chips from British Style! The prices are extremely reasonable and the quality is exceptional. Old school, wrapped in paper as it should be with amazing, golden, crispy batter. If you call 10 minutes ahead it will be ready when you walk in the door. This is one of Toronto's hidden gems that only the locals know about. You will not be disappointed with the price or the quality! The only challenge is that parking is not easy when it's busy, but you can always find something even if you have to walk a minute or two."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place since it was Friday and didn't want to drive to olde York on Laird.  Oh boy do I wish I did.  Ordered haddock and chips $7.50. Very reasonable price.  But the fish was non existent under a 1 inch of greasy mushy no flavour batter.  The chips were cutthick not crispy and undercooked. The lot went in the garbage.  Complete let down."}
{"text":"This place is real old school with great fish! Don't forget the tar-tar sauce on the counter."}
{"text":"This was really good. Halibut and chips, shrimps, onion rings, poutine. All really good. A bit greasy and the poutine needed more gravy, but taste was the top fish and chips I've had and the shrimp were deveined thankfully, so delicious."}
{"text":"It is British Style and it is very reasonably priced for such good quality of food."}
{"text":"It's almost a hole in the wall but the food is was fresh and delicious and not greasy!! The prices are reasonable. I really liked the halibut fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Blink and you'll miss this Dundas and Coxwell institution. It defines hole in the wall and it's understated interior certainly encourages takeout. Portions are huge though and British Style is one of the best spots in Toronto for authentic fish and chips.

They offer a variety sea fare, including traditional favorites like cod, haddock and halibut. Most meals are priced in the $10 range.

Located at 73 Coxwell Ave. at Dundas St. E."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best pub style fish & chips in the east end & the also have pop shoppe soda. One these day I will try the deep fried mars bar."}
{"text":"TLDR. Awesome value, great food, best in the area for fish and chips.

This place rocks. Feels a little retro inside, which I love to see when old places are maintained so well. The menu has some interesting options I haven't seen in other fish and chip joints, like oysters, scallops etc.  

If you are at the nearby beach this summer and burger priest is packed, head here. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is right in our neighbourhood and a few years back it was a great treat to order from here. Tonight was our second bad experience in a row. Last time we ordered I am certain we were given cod, not the halibut we ordered. I called and the owner insisted this was not the case. Tonight we went there to pick up our order and we didn't realize until we got home, but it was the wrong order. We called and they said just keep the order ( there was more food than we had ordered ) as if they were doing us a favour. They had charged us for this expanded order!  I didn't want $40 worth of food. So we walked back and picked up our order. The fries were definitely not fresh. The fish was greasy.  And there was no recompense for their error. So we are done with thus place. Quality has decreased. Clearly the service is suffering. I can find better ways to spend our take-out budget."}
{"text":"Really greasy fish and chips. Well okay, the fish was greasy and the chips were decent. Methinks a oil change was in order. Huge portions however-you can easily get a greasy order of fish and chips for $7. (haddock)"}
{"text":"I too drive past this location and always wanted to try...

Fish batter is a tad too thick.

Fried if beef oil which is supposed to give it more authentic taste (I would have to try real fish and chips to really compare).

Price is right.

Fries soggy but not sure it's because we had take out and it sogged up in the paper wrap.

Overall I would have it again, close location... Friendly service... and price is right. ... oh and lots of msg..."}
{"text":"At first glance this seems like authentic enough fish& chips place. The fish and chips come wrapped in brown paper( not recycled newsprint).
I am not sure what kind of oil they use, but I had lard like taste in my mouth for about an hour and half after eating here. 
The portions aren't bad and the fries are decent but the lard taste is disappointing.  
 Pre packed mass produced tartar sauce doesn't help things either. 

I have had better fish and chips in local pubs."}
{"text":"Another really great fish and chips shop in Toronto. FIsh is fresh and batter is crispy. The owner delivers friendly service with a smile. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips joint. Used to go once a week but the quality started going so we haven't gone in a while. Huge portion of chips."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a thousand times and was always meaning to stop, and finally this past Sunday we did.

I'm glad I read some reviews while waiting for my order to be prepared.  The fish here has amazing batter, and the house made tartar sauce is a must have!  Hubby had the haddock and chips and I went with the Halibut and chips.  The Haddock was an amazing value at just over $7 for 1 piece with chips.  Halibut was closer to $11 (it was 10-something).  

It's totally worth having, just about every one take's theirs away, and you can call in advance to place your order so you don't have to wait.  Does it get better than that?!?"}
{"text":"Ordered from there twice. If you like greasy breaded and fried fish it's quite good and not expensive."}
{"text":"Best Fish and Chips in the city. As good as the best of Britain! 

Fantastic value for money. 

Haddock is my go-to and tastes great everytime. The batter sticks to the fish like it should. Proper thick cut chips are spot on and always cooked to perfection. Gravy tops it off. 

I'm totally spoilt now, I'm unable to eat Fish and Chips anywhere else!"}
{"text":"It was exactly how I expect. Their service was pretty nice and also their prices were not much. I can suggest to who think go there."}
{"text":"We had the haddock and chips with some clams... very light batter, really delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We had Scallops and Chips and Halibut and Chips. Both were cooked to perfection and not greasy. Coleslaw is awesome too. Only downside the gravy is a little salty. It is best to call ahead and order as there are a lot of people waiting for their order."}
{"text":"Not as good as Reliable but not as expensive either. If you're craving fish & cops (they're across the street) you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pollock & chips, $5.99.
Haddock & chips, $7.05.
Poutine, $4.85.

Haddock fish had some hard parts.
Fries were authentic and really good.
Poutine was ok.

For the price, it was worth it.
Old-school, wrapped in paper."}
{"text":"Value for money.  
Street parking is available and free.
Small restaurant only about 2 tables for two n 2 tables for 4.
We ordered 3 different fishes. Pollock which is the cheapest, flaky texture, good portion.  Cod, medium price, good texture, just too much batter.  Halibut, priee a bit of on high side but still better than other restaurant. Small portion.
Very good portion French fries."}
{"text":"Food is yummy not too greasy and the price is amazing for the potion you get. 
Best to call in first for take out   and always get their house made tarter sauce."}
{"text":"British Style is in my top 3 for fish and chip places in Toronto. The batter is very light and crispy. It never hinders the flavour of the fish. You get a nice sized piece of halibut with your meal. The fries are always fresh cut and are cooked to perfection! They have Halibut, Haddock, And Cod. They also have shrimps and chicken fingers.  I always get the Halibut and Chips and they are top notch. Don't hesitate to try British Style you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Small place but it gets busy! Not a lot of seating, would suggest take out. Price is good but amount of fish is not enough. However, food tastes great!"}
{"text":"a bit inconsistent, but when they're in the zone, the fish is the very best in the city.  the fish, not the sides or the service or the ambiance or the..."}
{"text":"I am suddenly into fish & chips.  Kat & I were on one of our patented 'I work from home' weekday adventures and we decided to hit British Style for a comparison against my favorite, Reliable Fish & Chips.  To summarize in one word - greasy.  I mean everything was greasy; the people working here, the depressing ambiance and of course the food.

Location:
Reliable is closer to my house but British Style has less stressful parking. Tie.

Price:
British Style was less expensive.  Point BS.

Ambiance:
No contest.  Reliable is classy, comfortable and clean.  BS is none of these things.  The door actually says Beck Taxi on it, it was freezing inside and extremely run down.  BS encourages you to leave while Reliable encourages you to stay.  Point Reliable.

Staff:
Again, no contest.  The woman at BS was a 'shouter-talker' and I was distracted from my conversation by her... shouting. Point Reliable.

Food:
Personal taste.  I prefer Reliable with it's lighter batter.  BS is VERY greasy (like lard-film coating my mouth for an hour after leaving) and Reliable is lighter tasting.  You get a much larger portion at BS (the fish was HUGE.. like the size of a dvd case) which was not really a selling feature for me, but it might be for you. The batter is very different at these places making this a rather editorial point being awarded to Reliable. Both places have a good selection of specialty pops, with BS having my favorite Stewart's key lime and Reliable having a cane sugar cola drink. Point Reliable.

Clearly, Reliable wins the weekday work at home crew fish & chips shootout for February 2010.

I will never go to BS Fish and Chips again outside of force majeur unforseen circumstances (Reliable IS closed on Sundays...)."}
{"text":"Haiku:

Desperately hung
Need some grease in da hood
Fuck yeah, British Style"}
{"text":"Very good food, good pricing, only issue is parking, but they do encourage you to phone in your order for fast pickup. Dine in is an option, take out is what everyone seems to do. Food is always fresh, fish is always excellent, staff are always great."}
{"text":"I agree that the fish and chips are a little greasy, but that is probably was makes them so tasty. I am note a big seafood lover, but this place is definitely the best fish and chips joint for miles around. A \"must stop\" when you are in the Beaches!"}
{"text":"Truly fantastic fish & chips. Huge portions - biggest we've ever seen in the city, and for incredibly good prices. Chips are incredibly crisp and the fish portions are huge and crisp. Not sure why the other reviewers were complaining about greasiness - um, deep fried food that's greasy? Isn't that the point? Honestly, this place is one of the best parts about living in this 'hood. :)"}
