{"text":"Bons tacos surtout celui au chorizo.  La prochaine fois j'essaierai à la crevette panée ou aux champignons.  Les sauces goûtaient un peu similaires je mettrais de la Valentina ou ce genre de sauce piquante sur la table. Je ne suis pas certaine que l'emballage des tacos soit adéquat,  ça coulait de partout."}
{"text":"Great tacos ! Good service I  liked the ambiance the chorizo taco was great octopus a bit fishy but still good! Guac is good as well!  2 tacos is enough and very filling."}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé tous les tacos classiques, avec un verre de horchata. Les tacos étaient bons, assez gros, mais c'était assez dispendieux. Le service était rapide, mais pas très chaleureux."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! The corn tortillas are fragrant, and the fillings are generous, 2 tacos makes a full meal. I'm a vegetarian, so I had the cactus and the vegetarian chorizos tacos, both were tasty! Thumbs up for the guacamole appetizer, however the chips were generic store bought. Don't miss out on the très lèches. And the service is  genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"The Garbenador was extremely scrumptuous and fresh. I recommend the sirloin and the chicken tacos as well.  Avoiding the drinks would be a good idea, rather go for their Tres Leches Cake. It was divine - A perfect end to the best tacos in the city"}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis 2 semaines. Le service est sympathique. Le menu est simple et efficace. J'ai essayé une salade de cactus, c'était original. Le goût citronné était bon.   J'ai essayé un tacos a la pieuvre. C'était bon, mais malheureusement la pieuvre était trop caoutchouc. J'ai demandé la suggestion pour l'autre tacos et on m'a suggéré le tacos a la crevette panée. Je n'aime pas trop la friture, mais j'ai bien aimé que ce soit une grosse crevette et non de petites crevettes.  L'endroit est sympathique. C'est un peu cher à Montréal pour des tacos, mais ça vaut la peine d'essayer."}
{"text":"Had the machete de choriqueso and the fish taco. Both were great. The sauce that came with fish taco is outstanding. Owners were incredibly friendly had a nice chat with one while I was waiting for my take out.   Word of caution, the place was very busy when I went, may want to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos place!! The service is excellent and the staff is very welcoming ! The quality and quantity of the food is worth the price . I had the shrimp and the octopus tacos and they were both excellent. I will return again for sure."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and just tried this place for the first time.  The tacos are terrific.  I had pork tacos; my husband had the grilled octopus tacos.  Everything was perfect.  Great gluten free options."}
{"text":"I stopped for a quick lunch and just ordered the sirloin taco because the waiter said it came with two tortillas and that it might be enough. He was right, and the taco was delicious. I'd like to go back and try something different. Very friendly staff and strategic location on Rue Saint-Denis. Well done."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are traveling in Montreal and we wanted good Mexican food. We found this place on Yelp and went for lunch today and it was AMAZING.  We started out with the quesadillas, which were simple yet delicious. We also got the sirloin and chorizo tacos. Both were a good size and perfectly made. The highlight of this place though was their guacamole... wow. Honestly, I would recommend going to Tintan just for the guacamole alone. So fresh, so delicious, and a great size portion.  The staff is super friendly, the prices are great, and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, I want to give it a higher rating but because I'm Mexican, I have high expectations for tacos. That's the reason why I am only giving this place a three star rating.   I decided to visit because of the reviews. Let me say the size of the tacos is big! One taco is really more like two tacos. I had a chicken and an al pastor taco, they were okay. That's just it. I wish the pastor had more flavor.  However, their guacamole and esquite are fantastic!   The service was also very good. And I love that the food is cooked to order. You can basically see them cooking, and washing dishes. I like that for some reason.   The place is small but it was not crowded when we stopped by on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"What a treat! Having been traveling all over Canada recently, I was wishing for something that was a bit closer to food I would find at home. Tacos Tin Tan did not disappoint.   I had threes tacos, Chicken, Montreal (steak), and Nopalitos.  They were delicious and generous portions! The meats were tender and flavored perfectly, and the grilled onions and bell peppers inside the taco were also delicious.   Two salsas provided were delicious and clearly home-made. Red super spicy hot! Green milder but delicious.   I also had the guacamole which was perfectly chunky, just how I like it. It was delicious on the tacos.   I highly recommend a stop. The place is small but has great character, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"It was very good and authentic. The tacos are a decent portion/size each taco cost around the  5-6$ mark.  The also do take-out which we didn't do but probably will be taking advantage of in the future.  Everything is cooked fresh, which is great but on the other hand you do have to wait a bit to get your food."}
{"text":"We were drawn in from the very high reviews and had high hopes but most of us didn't enjoy our meal.  I didn't enjoy my steak tacos, and the chicken quesadilla was basically just two chicken tacos with cheese. I'm not a big fan of cilantro though and i didn't know it was part of the garnish since it wasn't listed in the ingredients. Almost everything comes with cilantro so if you like that then you're good, if not, make sure you ask to remove it.   The fish taco was delicious though! If I came back I would just order those.   They had a good special of 3x tacos for $11. They all have to be the same though.   Find out what the favourites are here because we tried a wide variety and only a few stood out."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my take-out tacos from here! I ordered the chicken and fish tacos. At first, I was worried about the price-to-quantity ratio, as the order came to $15 or so. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I got home and saw two fish tacos and a large chicken taco. It was plenty.  I was asked if I wanted spicy salsa, said yes, and the server clarified whether I wanted it \"very\" spicy. I was glad I said medium, because it was hot!   A nice authentic place that is definitely worth a try. Next time, I will come and have a drink on the patio!"}
{"text":"We went to this place around 10:30pm on a Saturday hoping to find some great margaritas. Ending up with over-priced, minimally alcoholic, frozen margaritas that just tasted like salt. Not sure if they put salt at the bottom of the glass or what, but way too salty. Also got chips and guacamole and the guacamole was brown as if it had been sitting in a container all day. Overall, not impressed and over-priced for what they sell."}
{"text":"Walked in somewhat near closing for takeout and the staff weren't bothered at all, they promptly prepared our food and OMG it was so good. I ordered 1 pollo taco and 1 Montréal taco, both were excellent. I loved the hot salsa served on the side!"}
{"text":"I got the vegan chorizo tacos and they were delicious. Kind of spicy, but a great place to go if you're with and omnivore since there are options."}
{"text":"Coming from the US and been to a lot of amazing Mexican restaurants in southern states of US, I was pleasantly surprised with the food of this place. The tacos were really good. The place is small and cute.  The Mushroom taco was may be the best Mushroom taco I ever had. 5/5  The veggie taco was ok. 3/5 Shrimp taco 4/5.  The drinks were ok for the price you play."}
{"text":"This place is great! Ate for under 15$ a person and it was absolutely delicious. The fish taco was amazing and a good portion. Overall, a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Très bon tacos !  Situé sur la rue Saint-Denis, Tacos Tin Tan ne paye pas trop de mine à première vue. Le restaurant est assez petit et ne dispose que de 3-4 tables en terrasse, mais la nourriture y est bonne et le personnel est sympathique et à l'écoute.  Les tacos sont vendus à l'unité, mais ils sont assez gros. La galette est une galette de blé et non de maïs, son goût est donc assez léger.  Pour ma part, j'ai testé : - Un taco au chorizo (ou saucisse mexicaine), pas piquant du tout et un peu gras, mais bon quand même ! - Un taco veggie avec des oignons, poivrons, courgettes et du guacamole, très frais.  La prochaine fois, je m'aventurerai vers des tacos plus originaux, notamment celui au poulpe ou celui au chorizo vegan ! Les margaritas ont également l'air d'être très bonnes.  Je recommande de prendre 2 tacos/personne, ou 3/personne si vous avez un gros appétit.  Niveau prix, on s'en sort pour 12-15$ avec 2 tacos/personne."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss if you're passing by, but what a pleasant surprise it is! Their tacos are on the larger side, 2 or 3 leaves me feeling satisfied. They cook everything to order, which means the meats arrive juicy and not on the dry side, like most pre-prepped taco places tend to. I highly recommend the fish taco, vegetarian with guacamole (WOAH, Did not know you could make vegetables taste this good), and the chorizo.   TL;DR hands down the best tacos I've had in my life. Go here."}
{"text":"This is a great new discovery. Cool and intimate little restaurant where you can either dine in or take out. I love the decorations and the atmosphere. This could be a perfect place to meet with friends or have a bite before going out. The tacos are flavorful and budget friendly. Definitely, a must visit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos! I generally dislike Americanized Mexican fast food but the stuff here is pretty authentic and everything is incredibly fresh. I had the lunch special of 3 tacos for $10.95 , I got the sirloin beef tacos and put hot sauce on them because I'm Indian after all and a spice-freak and they were perfect. Excellent guacamole also. Bonus: Tons of  cool wall art based on Latin American personalities and motifs."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about good tacos. I'd have to say, it was one of the best tacos I've had Montreal. The restaurant is filled with fun posters, good music, and with place to sit in or outside. First off, their Coca Cola is straight out of mexico! Talk about authentic. Then, we started out with the guacamole and the mango & beet salad. Delicious ! We proceeded with the shrimp tacos, sirloin and grilled octopus. Wow talk about a great price for the quantity and quality of the taco! They were all very tasty and they gave us three of their sauces to try which we're very good. I would def come back here for my tacos. 5 STARS!"}
