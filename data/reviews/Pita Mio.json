{"text":"Terrible. Shwarma was like a salt lick. Lentil soup they initially overcharged me and only after pointing out on the board did they change it. It was the worst lentil soup ever - all it tasted of was burnt lentils. Never again."}
{"text":"Pita Mio.  Mio, mio, my. Wow, this place is terrible!  Ok.  Where do I begin?
  I'm a patient woman.  Forgiving to a fault, even.  However, this travesty, for it's wrong doings, is headed straight for the guillotine.  I didn't expect much.  It's a take out joint.  Clean.  The overhead menu board, is easy, and simple, complete with spelling mistakes.  A random sampling of beverages in a half empty cooler, and a few spits of meat cluster in the space, nestled next to the menu offerings.  
  I asked for the chicken shawarma plate, my friend opted for the pita.  I had the suspicion, departing with our eats, that I was wrong to be enthused over this place.   Upon opening the styrofoam container, my notions were confirmed.  There it sat.  My dinner.  A tremendous pile of bland rice, with sad, dried up shards of chicken strewn over top.  It was dry.  And gross.  A handful of shredded iceberg lettuce beefed up a smattering of tabule, tucked in with a few pickles.  Some oily vegetables, comprising a pale version if fatoush salad, lay over top of the concoction.  No hummus.  Some mayonnaise (lacking garlic) managed creeped into the corner of this flavorless mess.   I tried to pick my way through, to no avail.  Even the hot sauce I requested was bland.  Come on.  
  For heaven's sakes, Pita Mio, step it up, yo!  You have a niche to fill here, and, sadly, have failed.   Even if I was raging drunk, I wouldn't eat this garbage.  Wait..  Yeah, no.  Not even then.  
  Shame on you."}
{"text":"Pita Mio is a fine, solid, pita joint.  Came here for a chicken shawarma and got a chicken shawama.  Nothing remarkable, but nothing glaringly problematic.  Shawarma was decently sized.  Meat, pita and toppings seemed generally fresh.  Pricing was good service was pleasant.  A good spot for cheap eats in the area, which is sorely lacking the area. 

agree with other yelpers, they need to rethink their sign....it just ain't working for me!"}
{"text":"This little shawarma place opened up in my hood.  Instantly, I was worried, since that spot seems to be a bit of a cursed location.  Then seeing the sign go up, I was skeptical.  It just seemed a little too Scarborough - no disrespect and big up yourself eastside!  Still, this area is gentrifying fast, so I was a little worried considering it didn't have nearly the panache of its immediate neighbours... to the east side.  Regardless, yesterday we thought we'd grab a quick shawarma on a miserable day... and I'm glad we did!

Gotta say, I like shawarma but more times than not I'm left underwhelmed.  Firstly, I cite the stale pita.  Secondly, the gristle in the meat.  Thirdly, the fact that sometimes the sauces soak into the stale pita leaving the rest dry.  I am happy to report that NONE of these apply to Pita Mio.  There wasn't a ton of meat, but the quality was excellent, and the fresh toppings totally made up for it.  For around $7 or something, two shawarmas made two meals for me... so no one can every question the value.  I think I even enjoyed the leftover portion more which says a ton!

Honestly, it was damn tasty and I will absolutely return.  It's a big space in an area that's slowly defining itself, so I think they've set themselves up for a battle.  If you're in the Queen and Broadview area and need some solid, cheap eats, I say please support them!"}
