{"text":"I came here before a party for a quick slice of pizza, and was service surprised with the service and the quality of food. It was 5 minutes before close, but they took happily took our order. We had the \"first choice\" pizza - pepperoni, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. The pizza took 10-15 min to arrive.
The pizza itself was very tasty - generous amount of toppings & warm crunchy crust.
It was a random visit only because we were in the area, but this turned out to be hidden little gem."}
{"text":"My Little Pizzeria is not your regular pizza joint that sells just pizza for take out with the standard garlic bread and chicken wings. They have salads, panzerotti, hot and cold panini, and pasta. There are also daily lunch specials till 2pm. The restaurant itself is bright with comfortable booths/tables. There's wallpaper and prints on the wall to give it a homely feel. 

I had many of their pizza (bbq chicken is awesome!) and also some food from their catering menu like chicken parmigiana and everything is delicious. My eating-in experience was a bowl of chili for lunch and it was perfect. Rich with tomatoes and mushroom, served with Italian crostini. 

They also offer gluten-free dough and whole wheat dough. Just ask!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Good quality ingredients and cooked well. Sauce is excellent and so is the cheese. Offers whole wheat crust or plain. Both are excellent.  

Prices are good too. Competitive.  A tiny bit higher than big chains, but considering this is a small family run place, and the ingredients are fresh, it's a fantastic value. 

Ordered the \"First choice\" ( pep, bac, mushroom) and a Hawaiian. Large. For family of four. Lots of yummy left overs. For about $30 with tax. Not bad for a family meal. 

Highly recommend if you're looking for some good quality pizza."}
{"text":"this local pizzeria came by selling a coupon book for $20 and we took a chance on them considering we had never tried their food before. What a gem!! We've now used 3 coupons over the span of a month because it's delicious and a great deal! (Side note: the pizzeria only keeps a couple of dollars from the book, the rest goes to support children's minor hockey.)

We've ordered the  First Choice - always topped with generous amount of cheese and fresh toppings; and the All Meat - plenty of protein and cheese. What's most impressive is their pizza dough, it's somewhat thick (compared to the franchises) but the texture is super light and fluffy. The evidence is in the leftovers which when we microwave, stays soft and chewable. 

Can't wait to try the other things they have to offer!"}
{"text":"The pizza 'cheese' is really unique and thats what I like about their pizzas. One of the best Italian places in Markham for sure! A couple times, I have experienced poor service."}
{"text":"Marghuerita pizza was fantastic. Caesar salad was well made. And garlic bread delish. So much better than the many chain pizza places in the neighbourhood. And they said they deliver."}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza's from this place for years now. Food is excellent, good tasting with generous amount of toppings. I typically order pick-up, ready really fast & hot. Delivery is good too but usually takes a few more minutes. The owner (Neal/Neil) and staff are very courteous and in good spirits. 

I don't usually give 5 stars but this place deserves it.

Thanks

{"text":"My friend lives in one of the condo buildings across the street so we thought we would try this place last Friday night based on the recommendation of a Pizza Nova delivery guy. And we were so glad we did! We ordered their Specialty Tuscan Pizza with no onions and they asked if we wanted to replace them with something else so we chose pepperoni. We both agreed it was the best pizza we have ever had. The crust was flavourful, airy and light, but crisp at the same time. All the ingredients tasted so good together. I don't know how they get the spinach to be so light and roasted with a tasty seasoning, but it's damn delicious! We ordered a medium and ate the whole thing. Needless to say, every time I visit my friend from now on I will request that we get pizza from here."}
{"text":"I love lasagna, and I especially love the one made here! It's super fresh and well made (with love!), and the pizza here is definitely different than the ones you would get rushed through the oven at other pizza places. The service is amazing, and everyone is super friendly! I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great pizza made with REAL ingredients.  The cheese is real mozzarella and not that oily processed type that most chains use.  Reminiscent of \"Mother's Pizza\" from back in the day!   The crust is soft, chewy and heaven sent! Have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the bbq chicken pizza and it was pretty good the first time I ordered it.   The second time it wasn't so great and lacked flavour.  Also, the pizzas are a bit on the pricey side.  So while you may get to try some unique pizza combos, I'd rather save my money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great place for Italian food and fair price! We love the pizza and chicken wings combo."}
{"text":"Needed a nice quick place to eat before a show at Long and McQuade's music up the road from MLP.
Found them through an internet pizza search.
I ordered a medium with pepperoni,mushrooms, onions, olives.....free anchovies and hot peppers on the side.
Really good pie.......baked just enough to make the shrooms start to dry a bit, the crust was firm but not crunchy, the body of the pie was thick enough that it didn't flop like others do when you pick up a slice, and there was enough sauce for you to taste, but not drown out the toppings.
If every pizza they create is consistent like this one, I am going to more shows at Long and McQuades just for an excuse to eat at MLP.

4 thumbs up!!!!  (2 diners....)"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza a few times but each time the pizza is a bit warm but gets cold very quick. Not sure how long exactly they cook the pizza's for but not quite sure why it would always be warm. 

I've ordered pizza from other places and they always come hot with steam coming out."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is very close to my house. The first time I tried their food was 10 years ago. I loved it then & still love it now. The quality is VERY good! Pizza has good amount of sauce vs cheese and the toppings are always fresh. The slices are excellent if you eat in or take out!  Sandwiches are large and have a lot of meat - they can start to get a bit pricey when you add toppings, but taste very good. The only problem i have with this place is the young staff (male). He has a poor attitude for serving customers, huffs & puffs under his breath and tosses things around. I've never seen him happy. In fact we walked out twice without ordering when we saw him working. I can't believe the owner is ok with someone like that working there. We always get delivery now instead of take-out or eating there."}
{"text":"I mean, here's the thing....the pizza was really delicious. BUT they do indeed cheap out with the ingredients, as others have said. 

We ordered the Margherita pizza from their \"gourmet\" pizza menu. It describes the pizza as extra virgin olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, tomatoes, basil, parmesan. The pizza was cheesy and delicious...but there was about one tomato per slice of pizza and the basil was the dried, \"spice\" kind that you shake out of a jar, instead of fresh basil. So I mean the ingredients are anything but gourmet. But it was still really yummy, I won't deny. 

The garlic parm bread was like a slightly classier, better crazy bread from Little Caesars. Also good. 

I won't hesitate to come back here, but it won't be a go-to. The prices aren't cheap and the ingredients not what I would expect given the prices...and the descriptions."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this place a couple of weeks ago. I was starving and waiting around on a freezing cold day all by myself with my mind totally engrossed in my computer. My bedtime clothes...basically a raggedy old t shirt and a similarly run down pair of shorts and disheveled hair.  Expecting the usual when the bell rang, I simply opened the door, and without really looking, i turned around to walk back to my desk and pick up my wallet. Then suddenly my mind snapped back and I turned back around to do a double-take..and then another double take... I noticed these massive gray eyes and a glowing smile holding a pizza and I just stopped and was thinking to myself....\"huh...whats going on here?!\" I couldn't help myself so I said, \"not the sort of pizza delivery person I was expecting\" ...she explains her role in today's pizza delivery which I understood and asked me to let her know if I was impressed by them.....could there be any doubt that I was? I forgot that I hadn't even gone to pick up my wallet yet...I dont even remember what the pizza was like...but you get 5 STARS from me"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighbourhood for years and have driven by this place without giving it a second thought.  After seeing the stellar yelp reviews, I decided to give it a shot. We ordered a large caesar salad and the L.P. pizza, with hot peppers and extra mushrooms, and left out the green olives and anchovies. 

The caesar salad description has a bunch of stuff including bacon bits in the description but it's really only lettuce, dressing and croutons. 

The pizza was decent but nothing special at all. I would say it's slightly better than Pizza Pizza and that's not saying much as far as I'm concerned. The crust was nothing special. It didn't taste like cardboard necessarily, but also didn't taste much better than that. There were ample topics but it just didn't come together the way I would have hoped. Overall, it was mediocre. 

We did decide to eat in on a nice spring weeknight.  They had the door open and the delivery guy came back and put the hockey game on, so not a bad environment."}
{"text":"In the land of terrible pizza places it's great to have My Little Pizzeria available. Every time we've ordered the pizza is very good. The delivery can be a little slow so make sure you order about an hour ahead of when you want your pie. It can also be a bit expensive but inline with the major chains and 100x better tasting. 

I've had pizza in many great places, New York, Chicago, Italy, so my expectations for pizza are very high so this is why only 4 out of 5. For sure this is my go to pizza place when home. 

Things to remember:

1. They have gluten free pizza crust, just ask
2. You can order your pizza thin crust, thick or regular - again, just ask. 
3. I've only ever had the pizza, not sure about the other non-pizza items on the menu."}
{"text":"My Little Pizzeria is another local gem of Markham.  It sells standard and gourmet pizzas, pasta, lasagna, deli and homemade sauces.  I have only tried its pizza and lasagna, so I can attest to these two items only.  They are delicious!!  The gourmet pizzas rival restaurant quality, and the lasagna is hearty with lots of meat and sauce (my young nephew loved it).  A friend of mine who is a girl guide leader told me that My Little Pizzeria also sells to schools and groups like girl guides on discounts.

MLP has a few tables for dining in, but its main business is take outs."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a neighbourhood pizzeria! We wanted to try this place out compared to the regular chained ones like pizza pizza. 

We ordered a large sized Deluxe Pizza with thin crust for around $17. Price was a bit steep! However, the overall pizza was delicious! The crust was just perfect and there were adequate amounts of topping on each slice! For the price, you get quality toppings as the cheese was not thin like other pizzerias but thick! Also, the pepperoni wasn't as salty as other places. Would definitely come back to try a different pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for about 5 years and love their pizza! They also do pizza days at some local schools which is great to keep it local and fresh. Highly recommend my Little Pizzeria - best pizza in Markham!"}
{"text":"After many years of living In the area we decided to give this pizza joint a try. 

Loved their pizza been very consistent. Toppings were fresh and they never skimped on them. 

The crust was cooked perfectly. 

We haven't try anything else on the menu but the pizza is top notch. 

This is our go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Soo good ! Took a bit of time to deliver but it is friday and so worth it. Had it for the first time and is it just me or did the crust kinda taste like fried chicken. Only getting this pizza for now on"}
{"text":"3.5 / 5
I have finally tried this little place out after months of driving past it. It's a small location with minimal seating inside..I really don't see many people 'dining in'. Along with pizza, they have some other sandwiches and the like.
I've come here for pizza a couple of times now, just a simple pepperoni pizza is my usual order. I found their crust to be fine, but nothing special. I got the Large pizza 'special' which was just cheese for $9.99. Additional toppings are $1.45...seems a bit steep, for a Large pepperoni with extra cheese I paid $15 when all is said and done. When I can get a large pepperoni for $7.99 pretty much next door, it gives me pause when thinking about my next order. I also noticed that there only seemed to be 1-2 pepperonis per slice. I'm not a fan when places are chintzy with the toppings.
If the pizza I got here totally blew away the competition it would be worth it, but it doesn't. I will come back on the odd occasion, but I'm going to continue my quest for good pizza in Markham!"}
{"text":"found this place via yelp. ordered the first choice pizza and it was excellent. when you eat too many pizzas from chains, you miss the shops that make pizza with cheese that stretch for days. the moral to the story here is that you get what you pay for. can't wait to try out some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I have driven past this little shop so many times over the years. I was actually looking on Yelp to find something different in the area and stumbled upon different reviews for this Pizzeria. So my husband and I drove a whole 10 minutes to get here and discover that we had been missing out all this time. We both had a veal on a bun and it was excellent. There are many items to choose from if you look at the menu.
 Best of all the service here was super friendly. Very clean. I am definitely going back again... perhaps I may go again today :)"}
{"text":"My Little Pizzeria is a good neighbourhood pizza joint. 

Pick up Special with a large for $9.99 and additional topping for $1.45 is quite decent and it was ready as promised.

I personally found the regular crust too doughy and thick and there were hardly any cheese or sauce. Maybe I would order a thin crust next time? Or even their gourmet pizza?

3 Star for now, I just wish it was better!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizzas and found all 3 seriously lacking sauce! Disappointed. Pizzas are average and wonder if with more sauce they would taste better. For now I'll stick with Pizza Nova!"}
{"text":"We thought this place would be an authentic Italian type pizzeria, however the pizza had too much dough to the toppings and sauce ratio . The taste of the dough was good, however too overwhelming, it just tasted like bread, with a little flavour. We also tried the \"roast beef dip\" ... the dip was terribly salty.. and the beef was just heated up cold-cuts from the package. Overall, definitely better pizza out there.... and do not try the roast beef dip."}
