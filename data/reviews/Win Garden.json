{"text":"Want a quick lunch at a great price this place it it!!! 
Staff was so friendly and seated us and asked for our drink order in a quick fashion.  The buffet selection was fresh and wonderful so much to choose from and such a small stomach. LOL. The food and the Desert was delicious and the price was out of this world!! 
Lunch with water for 2 people was under $20.00!! 
Don't have to worry about parking your vehicle, there is plenty of parking.  This place is a hidden gem!  We will be returning."}

{"text":"Nice restaurant but the buffet isn't that big. In fact, it's too small. Not enough selection and across the room, you can see the sanitation materials that a janitor would use. Not a big deal but makes the environment low rent. I had an okay experience but would recommend the Silver Star restaurant between no frills and the dolls store. Bigger and classier restaurant with much more food selection and still a very reasonable price for the buffet."}

{"text":"For a buffet, the food was great.  Very busy place on a Friday night, seemed a bit understaffed. All in all good food good price."}
