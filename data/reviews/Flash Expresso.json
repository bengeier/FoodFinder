{"text":"Location: On Notre-Dame Ouest. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and from there, it's less than a 10-minute walk. Street parking is available [metered].

The place: Discovering Flash was a really pleasant surprise. I LOVE the space - high ceilings, big windows, wood floors and minimal decor. It's got an old-school meets contemporary feel to it. All they need is a hammock for me to nap in when I visit, and we'll be all set. They play great tunes too, and have vintage cameras + photo books lying around. Definitely my kind of place.  They also offer photography classes and workshops and that's way cool. 

The goods: I only had tea so can't really comment on anything else. They carry Camellia Sinensis, which I like and they have a few sweet treats on hand and of course, coffee. 

Service: Great. The person who served me at the counter was very nice. But Sarla, one of the owners (I think) was superb - I LOVE her. She came over to clear our table as we were leaving, and we got into this great conversation with her about a variety of things. She's incredibly friendly and warm! Neither owner makes you feel like you've outstayed your welcome so you can cozy up with your coffee and your book, or check out the photo books they've got on hand - sit back and enjoy the music. 

Price point:: The tea was a little expensive at $4 a pop."}

{"text":"Love the style and love the service! Perfect for studying or meeting some friends for coffee after work! Photos meets expressos! Really inspiring and love the old school cameras!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent cafe right on Notre Dame.  It actually doubles as a photography studio which is a neat concept.  I was a fan of the cozy and minimalist decor and as an added bonus there was tons of natural light in the cafe.

They have a limited food menu but they are one of those places that does a few items very well.  I had a piece of apple cinnamon bread which was fresh, moist and balanced in flavour.  The owner kindly warmed it up for me which was a nice touch.  The latte that accompanied it was very nice too.

The service here exceeds expectations.  The owners are very welcoming and always talk to you with a big smile on their face.  They really make an effort to treat their customers well and that is always appreciated.

My only beef was the price which was a little high for my liking.  The latte and apple cinnamon bread were around $9 which is expensive compared to other coffee shops.  They were very high in quality but that price tag seems excessive."}
{"text":"Un café?  Un Studio pour photographe?
Les deux vous dis-je!

Découvert par hasard après une promenade d'hiver dominicale à la recherche d'un café et de chaleur.

Nous sommes tombés sous le charme du décor avec ce plafond haut, les luminaires magnifique et les divans ici et là, plus confortable que les chaise de terrasses en hibernation ;)

Le service: très courtois et chaleur par la propriétaire et photographe.  Vous commendez style libre au comptoire, allez vous asseoir si vous rester et on vient vous servir à la table .    

Leur café équitable du Santropol est d'excellente qualité et arômatique et bien coulé par les baristas en herbe!    Mon coup de coeur:  leur chocolat chaud délicieux servis dans un verre et avec une touche artistique!

Un studio pour shoothing photo à l'arrière où en plus de prise de photos, on y découvre que les photographes amateurs peuvent s'inscrire à des ateliers et y apprendre les bases de la photographie.   Vous pouvez faire faire votre portrait et m'a t'on dit en  semaine, en vitrine avec le mur de brique à l'avant, vous pouvez vous aussi être photographié ou utilisé l'espace pour un shoothing.

Un concept original juste pour St-Henri, en plein coeur de l'ancien quartier de St-Cunnegonde aux limites de la Petite Bourgongne à l'ouest de Griffintown.

Situé en face du Théâtre Corona à 10 minutes du Métro Lionnel Groulx."}
