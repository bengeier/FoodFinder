{"text":"We went there for dinner, the place was empty, no guests there.  
The Manager, or the Person in charge, was busy playing on the VLT's and the Waitress had \"Pink Eye\" and shouldn't even be serving Food and Drinks.
We were told the House Wine was on Happy Hour, but one I paid my bill I detected it was not.
Also my daughter ordered Gin & Tonic, but no Tonic Water in the house.
For dinner we ordered a Steak Sandwich, but sorry, they were out of Steaks.
Then my Daughter ordered Fish and Chips, but had to return the first order, because the fish seemed to be raw and freezer burned and had a funny taste.  
I was not charged for the Fish & Chips, but guess what, the second order they made took almost 45 minutes, and tasted just as awful, raw and freezer burned, we had it wrapped and chucked it in the next garbage can.  
Same with the Fettuccine Alfredo I ordered, they tasted doughy and just terrible and I had an upset stomach for two days.
The Manager or Person in charge tried to apologized and said the Kitchen had someone in training.
Sure wount be going there anymore.  
No wounder this place has no guests, and they can blame themselves for that."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and had the Linguine Vongole, my wife had the pizza that was on sale, 2 topping 10\". Both entrees were exceptional.   The ambiance was nice and cozy in the lounge.

I would definitely advise you to give them a try."}
{"text":"This is one of the best  Italian restaurant that I've eaten at in calgary. I went there with my family. The girls loved the pasta dishes. The kids menu for my little guy was a good change and my pizza was perfect. There are other non Italian dishes on the menu - table next to us were having wings poutine and drinks and it looked great. I will be back to try those next."}
