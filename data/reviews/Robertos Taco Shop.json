{"text":"Great Robertos location, though my favorite is now the one on Centennial since it's so close to my house!  Carne Asada Fries = Winning Menudo = Winning  Weekend of Bi-Winning!  (Menudo only served on weekends)"}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious food and always fast! Favorites are burritos for breakfast ham or chorizo is always good. Love the rolled tacos."}
{"text":"One of the fastest and delicious taco shops that are open late (open 24 hours)!  The Carne Asada fries are one of the best items on the menu (make sure you get some of the green hot sauce).  The price is also pretty good for their large portions and is a great meal for any time of the day."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries! Open 24hrs and never too packed! Minus 1 star cause they got no Mexican Cokes!"}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hour.  The food and service is good.  They have a small salsa bar that includes green and red hot sauce, cucumbers, green onion and a carrot mix.  They will provide you with a water cup that you can fill up at the soda machine.  They have $1 hard shell Chicken Taco's on Wednesday.  You can also call in your order if you are in a hurry. I recommend the Chicken Burrito.  The parking lot is busy, but I can always get a close spot."}
{"text":"got a chorizo burrito went home started grubbin down and as i was eating i didnt taste no sausage thought to myself oh its somewhere in the middle then as i kept eating still all egg.. came back to the store told them and didnt get a refund or another chorizo burrito.. had to eat carls jr next door... very disappointed"}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Beans were very salty, tacos were good but not exceptional.  I would return but not a favorite."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant near my house, it's open 24 hours a day it's always not super busy when I come by late at night and the food is simply outstanding."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. The restaurant it's good to grab a quick bite.  Quick and good service. Great prices"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for quite some time. I enjoy the food and customer service. But who is in charge of scheduling!? When there's only 1 guy doing the cashiering, the cooking, the cleaning. Like really?! I feel sorry for this guy. Like WOW. My heart goes out to this lonely single hard working dude. My condolences..."}
{"text":"Best Shrimp Cocktail on this side of town. I've been to a couple different mexican spots on this side of town and always come out dissapointed don't really like to have robertos either unless I absoulety want mexican food quick or I'll cook it myself lol but my brother told me about this one and said i'd like it since im very picky when it comes to mexican food, guess he was right taste a lot better than other robertos"}
{"text":"Yummy! Saw it on the Travel Channel and had to make a stop. I love their tacos and salsa bar."}
{"text":"Just went there and the food was ok. I got a chicken burrito the portion was ok. Except my friend got steak burritos and the portion was small they used to  be bigger but now the are making them smaller the floor was very dirty I did not like that because is the first thing you see when you enter then you wonder how clean is the inside of the kitchen.  So I might not be going back as I was not impressed"}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant ordered and waited too long. At least four people that ordered after me received their food first and my order was taken incorrectly."}
{"text":"Love this location, food is always good.  They don't skimp on the taco fillings.  Love the staff here, always friendly even if their english is not very good."}
{"text":"Great location.  Food is consistent.  For the money not bad.  I will come back to this place.  Love that they never skimp out on the cheese.  Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Always come here they take there time  to cook the food they give a lot of meat in the carne asada fries worth every penny"}
{"text":"i like the 99cent Wednesday chicken taco special. it's a very authentic experience to me. if you are a pretentious kind of person you won't like it here - better stick with high end restaurants and pay a lot more - being pretentious comes with a price."}
{"text":"Very clean location and new! if you're in this side of town do yourself and favor and drive to the one on gibson! this is probably the worst roberto's in town food wise! i've been here 3 times now because it's the closest location to me. i will NEVER eat at this robertos's again! If you are a fan of their franchise i can assure you that you won't find satisfaction in the food at this location. i thought maybe it was just a fluke with the first 2 times, but nope 100% this location is terrible food wise. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice staff. I wish they would consciously make an effort to melt their cheeses, but I still come back like every other day."}
{"text":"I was super excited when i thought i found an \"authentic mexican taco shop\" close to my new home, (im originally from Los Angeles so i KNOW what a real authentic taco is, i was practically raised eating authentic mexican food) anyway this place was dog shit. I mean u walk in n the ppl working there are clearly mexican n dont speak the best of english (which is fine), i ordered Carne asada taco and chicken taco... Since when is carne asade little chunks of grizley flavorless meat?? So gross... Everything was gross tasting there. Im not a pickey eater but i couldn't do it, my body wouldnt allow me to swallow all the chewy grizle (gross)... I gave it to my dog n she wouldnt eat it either. The chicken was not as bad but it wasnt good.   This place was an epic fail, i feel like they have lost touch w theyre culture n what mexican food really is.  Maybe this is mexican food in vegas (god i hope not). its just whitewashed bland not even close to real mexican food. Im surprised they didnt put ketsup ontop as the sauce.  Im warning u.... U might vomit if u eat here  Oh ya... even the rice and beans weren't edible for me or my dog, if thats not enough the girl working there was a BI%*H. That is all :("}
{"text":"I had the shrimp burrito.  It was very good.  Lots of big shrimp in the burrito.  Also you can get a jalepeno pepper on the side for those who want to spice it up a bit."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are bomb, but today I asked for a tamala and was given a tamala with all these extras.  What the heck is this? I want a tamala.  The lady was rude when I asked at the counter, but overall the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Found a metal/plastic twist tie in my undercooked bacon breakfast burrito! Terrible surprise."}
{"text":"This is Las Vegas with top service, however this place is below par. The employees need to be better trained with manners. The condiments are not fresh with the store being so empty you'd expect it to be clean!"}
{"text":"The day my Mexican-born husband (now ex) said the food at Roberto's (Henderson location) was pretty good, I knew it'd become a staple on my \"go-to take-out food\" weekly menu. So, a year ago, when I moved to a location equidistant from two locations (Durango and Rainbow), I knew I was a winner!!! That is, until yesterday (Saturday, 14Nov15 at 5:40pm).  The moment I approached the cashier, I knew there was trouble. Just the look on her face was evident that she wasn't having the best of days...but who doesn't have those kind of days, right? She was \"decent\" with what she said. How she said it needs some work...lots of work. I ordered their \"12 rolled tacos\" special (w/beef), chile verde burrito (which I had to repeat twice) and a mango agua fresca (which she thought I said 2 and asked me to verify - I wanted one large one). She placed the cup in front of me, which was torn down the side from the top but I don't believe anyone standing where she was would've seen that. I asked for another cup, pointing to the tear and my perception was she grabbed the cup in a much more aggressive way that seemed unnecessary, tossed it and grabbed another, in a similar fashion as the defective one. I paid cash, got my change and receipt and stepped aside. After she rang up the next customer, I asked her for the drink as they need to dispense it (where the soft drinks are self-serve). She barely looked at me and said \"ice\". My mistake - this was the first time I ordered one of their aqua fresca drinks so I was not aware that I had to put ice in the cup first. I said, \"oh, ok\" and got my ice. She filled the drink and while I waited for the food, I went to the salsa bar, got sliced cucumbers and waited. I heard her call out for an order that was similar to mine - the burrito was a chile relleno burrito. She scanned the people standing in front of her and we made eye contact but she didn't see who placed this order. So I didn't think anything of it. Another order was called out...she had to call it twice, and the second time, in my opinion, was done in a very condescending tone. But with the attitude that was coming from this girl, I wasn't surprised. That was when I looked at my receipt....there it was - chile relleno burrito.   Great...now I have to approach this girl again (not just to collect the food). And really, I was ok with the chile relleno burrito. I never had it in a burrito but I was willing to try it. I decided I was going to point out the error and say that it was fine.... I only wish I could have.   I waited for her to finish with a customer and I said \"excuse me, I wanted the chile verde burrito, but....\"  I was given an attitude-filled, overly exaggerated \"No\"... you said chile relleno\". She doesn't remember that I'm the one who placed this order but she remembers that I said chile relleno? I almost fell to the floor. Again, I said \"Excuse me? I said chile ver...\" And I got the same \"no\", only this time, it lasted a second or two longer than the first (I kid you not!) I couldn't believe this. I've worked with the public for 24 years and was stunned, no, appalled at the sheer gall this girl had. If she hadn't interrupted me the first time, none of this would have happened. We were literally yelling at each other. There was another man behind the counter next to her who was trying to help and I certainly appreciate his attempt to resolve the issue but little miss attitude was more than I cared for. I said to him that I'll take the food but I'm never going back there. And I know that means nothing to them. One customer, $20, maybe once a week will not hurt them. The only mistake I'm kicking myself for is taking the food. I should have said that I didn't want any of it and I want my money back.  Attention: Roberto's at 8680 W. Warm Springs Rd, my order #1759, was rung up on NO. 643990 Reg 1, \"employeeFE\" at 17:38 (this is on the bottom of the receipt)....you will want to teach this one girl to leave her attitude at the door before she clocks in for work or you may lose more loyal customers like myself. And if she's confronted by ANY customer, she needs to listen to them before responding. None of this, including this very poor review, would have happened if she just listened to me.  Lesson in life: Anyone who starts any confrontation with an aggressive defense is lying just to save face. The way she handled this is a perfect example."}
{"text":"Me and my family stopped at robertos taco shop in las vegas ..the food there was excellent so much could not finish it all.....service was great the workers were very kind and friendly and the restrauant was clean.. I give it a 5 star I will be back.."}
{"text":"For the price, it's pretty solid grub. Got a carne asada chimi and chile relleno. Didn't finish either since it's soooo much food. The chile relleno was one of the better ones that I've had and it was crazy-cheap. The chimi was good, though not spectacular. It's a good go-to spot for takeaway mex food. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I know these guys have a strong, dedicated following.  But I've tried it a few times and I strongly feel that their food is tasteless and makes you feel endlessly bloated.  Service and atmosphere are equally mundane.  The best thing about this place is the salsa bar.  But it is often messy and depleted."}
{"text":"Awesome deal 12 rolled tacos for $10, what a steal. More cheese and guac than you know what to do with. Can't beat it!!!"}
{"text":"The first few times I visited this particular location, the food was great. It was hot, the portions were abundant and the staff was friendly as well.  The last three visits sucked. The carnitas were hacked up, dried up, hard, greasy, and had that clear look that meat gets after it's overcooked and then dries out on the counter. I guess it's needless to say, the meat was flavorless as well. The adobada was hard, greasy, and hacked into tiny, tasteless granules of meat. The rice was dry. The beans were so dry, you had to scrape the top off to get the bottom bland portion.  There used to be two men behind the counter (one very handsome : )) that did an exceptional job with the food. They were friendly and humorous as well.  The two women that I had seen on my last three visits were just and dry and bland as the pitiful food...They knew that they were passing off crap. I'd have to agree with Nick R. on this one.   GO TO THE LOCATION ON S. NELLIS INSTEAD!!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is by far that one place to always keep in mind for that quick lunch or dinner. Having been to many here in town I have to say this location is the BEST!!! It stands out from the rest from the hospitality offered by the two running this place. After just a couple of visits they began to recognize me. They don't speak perfect English but enough to pick up what you are getting at most of the time and always offer service with a smile while keeping the place clean.   I recommend anything with the carne asada. I love the nachos. There is never a time I have came away hungry as they always give you a good sized portion for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest Roberto's I've been in.. Always good service and food."}
{"text":"The worst Roberto's I've ever been too! It's so close to me and I keep trying it out hoping it will be better but it is always terrible! Beans like mud, cheese is never melted and corn tortillas are cold and nasty! I couldn't even eat my meal tonight. Lesson learned. I'll be driving to Rancho & Craig from now on."}
{"text":"Not the best experience but wanted to try something new. The chicken burrito and salsa bar were ok but everything else was terrible, including the $3.08 they charged for greasy disgusting chips. It was also hard to communicate with the 2 employees they had on site as my Spanish is limited and there English almost seemed non exist ant."}
{"text":"For someone who grew up with Roberto's, this location's food is decent. Meat ratios in the food are especially good. They can be a little stingy with the guacamole but what Roberto's isn't? My only complaint is the service and wait times. I wouldnt recommend you go out of your way for this one but it's nice to have in the neighborhood for those tired nights."}
{"text":"This location always misses the mark. Salsa is watery here unlike some of the other Robertos. Sadly after three bad experiences I will be taking the extra time to drive further. Beans and rice are mediocre. There is no love put into the food and it definitely shows. I wish they were all consistent but clearly each one is different."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here! They have great food for a good price. Love their sausage breakfast burrito! They have really good refried beans and are always nice."}
{"text":"I ordered carne asada fries with extra sour cream. I get home and there's no sour cream. That's not the first time they messed my order up. Not going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"This has to be home to one of the laziest employees ever.   She claimed they ran out of forks in a 24 hour restaurant.  This place always has a slow cashier, but add lazy to the description.   I'd go to other places."}
{"text":"enchiladas were not good, and the beans were very bland. and the rolled tacos have more tortilla than filling. i like robertos so i didnt think i would have room for ice cream afterwards but now i definitly do."}
{"text":"Perfectly tasty quick Mexican food.  Awesome that they're open 24hrs, and they run good weekly specials.  Food's always a little on the salty side, but usually pretty decent flavor.  The people that work there are friendly too, and usually pretty prompt with the counter service."}
{"text":"You get immediately impressed by the big serving, but I feel the taste is just not enough to \"hit the spot.\" It's good to know they're open late enough when I have an horchata craving.   Pros: serving, price, late night horchata Cons: taste"}
{"text":"Try the breakfast burrito...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this establishment half a star, I would. I went to go enjoy what I thought would be a great meal alongside with great service. That was not the case tonight. We ordered carne asada fries with everything on the side. First of all carne asada fries don't ever come with lettuce. (There was an excessive amount of lettuce in my fries). I asked for horchata & the lady that took my order rolled her eyes at me when I did. Not only did she roll her eyes at me, she also gave me 90% ice when I asked for no ice to begin with. I went inside to see if I could refill my drink or at least just take out the ice & she talked to her employees like I was in my wrong for asking to refill my drink. (It wasn't empty) She then grabbed a fork from who knows where & proceeded to take out the ice instead of just using a different cup. I then apologized to her for the inconvenience & she never apologized back. No manners whatsoever. I wasn't being rude or picky. I would know, I work at a restaurant myself. Overall unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times, since I work in the shopping center directly in front. This location gets surprisingly busy, but the staff is always friendly and the food comes out correct the first time, in my experience. On busy days, you could sit and wait upwards of 15-25 minutes, even for a small order. Not their fault, but still an inconvenience. That coupled with lack of cleanliness even during slow periods keeps the restaurant at 3 stars for me. Convenient location, right inside fabulous Freddy's"}
{"text":"For a chain food place, this place tops all of the other Mexican fast food places in Vegas. The owner and all if the employees are cool people and they will change the food to how ever you want it. I give this place a double thumbs up. The crane asada fries are my personal favorite and are 'da bomb'"}
{"text":"If I could I would give it zero stars worst place to go and eat worst service doesn't give you your order right and food is old please close this place or mange it batter"}
{"text":"Under $20 for two people to eat...with a condiment bar and free refills! Thank you Robertos for existing. You make me torta-licious."}
{"text":"This is my first time here I have heard about them so I decided to try then for lunch...omg they have the best chicken tacos & burritos I'm not big on Mexican food but this was great I'll be back ago"}
{"text":"Seriously, shut down this location.  By far, they have the worst service ever. What is the point of calling in your order and being told to pick up at the drive thru if you're not going to start making the food until I get there? I get to the drive thru and wait behind 3 cars for 15 minutes. I get to the window, pay, and now they start making my food.   This is not my first experience with this Roberto's location but it will definitely be my last. Their customer service is worse than any other place I have been too. Shut it down."}
{"text":"I normally love the food from Robertos. Tonight I got a massive wooden toothpick in my chimichanga. I called several times to make them aware of this, but nobody answers the phone. I'm so disappointed! I won't return to this location!!"}
{"text":"Purchased a burrito and chips with guacamole. Saw the cashier scoop the last bit of guac out of the bin, put it in the cup and set it aside, after I paid for my meal. Got home and the guac container that was scrapped with what was left was given to me. Not a problem. I opened up the container and it was more brown than green. Thank you for that. Usually average food with average service. Tonight just tipped the scale to not eat here again."}
{"text":"Mexican food that is quick and to the point. Great for a quick lunch. Good food, but fast food atmosphere."}
{"text":"The carne asada breakfast burrito is an EXCELLENT way to soak up last night's beer!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Roberto's twice and each time it has been horrible. I don't really expect much from this below average taco shop. But the family was craving tacos,  and it's so close. Never again though.   Carne Asada - Bad Adobo - Really Bad Fish Tacos - Really really bad Horchata - Even this was bad!!  I honestly don't understand why Roberto's is the most popular taco shop in Vegas. Next time I will drive the extra 10 minutes and go to Fausto's."}
{"text":"Excellent,  food and service! I recommend taco Wednesdays.  Their busy but fast and the chicken tacos are perfect."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Five stars because this location is so delicious. Every time I go there I could care less about the calories I consume, all I can think about is the heavenly taste. I usually get the rolled tacos. They're so addicting."}
{"text":"Shrimp burritos are the best. The guy at the register messed up our phone order once but they gave us free burrito and theme we ordered. Love Robertos!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the Carne asada burritos we had ordered, the meat is full of gristle and is tasteless. Had to smother it with sour cream. It didn't help."}
{"text":"Quesadilla was like molten lava, chicken taco was ice cold. Had lettuce when I specifically asked for no lettuce. Brought it back and they had just tried to take the lettuce off, but failed miserably as there was still lettuce all over the taco. Their lettuce is soggy and tastes like dirt most of the time. The guy at the front acts like he is the busiest guy in the world when he's got 3 people in the whole place. Doesn't care to speak English to customers. (Or just doesn't care to learn)... Anyway, there are much better Roberto's locations than this one.   Solid 1 star."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos and nice service!! You need to try the Horchata even though it is a bit on the sweeter side."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos but they can't get an order right. This is the third (and last) time, I won't be going back. If you order a no meat, no cheese breakfast burrito, expect bacon and cheese. The bacon is too finely chopped to simply remove and cheese is melted so it can't be removed. Tired of getting home and having to go back for a redo, today was my last order."}
{"text":"Quick, Fast, Cheap Mexican Food. Open 24 Hours Oddly enough, I've NEVER gotten sick from eating here! ;-) The Horchata is a MUST!"}
{"text":"quick service. i got the beef tacos.  Their rice were pretty much salt balls and the beef was super dry. so it was really salty and really dry. I threw them away after my 3rd bite.  Taco shell was crunchy though."}
{"text":"Whether you are ending your day on a drunken bender or waking up from a severe hang over, this is the place to be...   The Chili Relleno burritos are super yummy and are the perfect thing after a night filled with punk rock and debauchery.  The staff is super friendly and they always have your food out in a flash"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and they're open late which is a huge plus! Would definitely recommend to anybody. Great service as well"}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito is my favorite.. i Hold the Pico and the Guac however they then charge you $2.20 for Cheese and Sour Cream. Making it an almost $9 Burrito!! not worth that much HOWEVER at other Robertos locations it's under $6 for the exact same thing.. C'Mon Roberto's charge the same at every location and stop charging an arm and a leg for extras.. I won't go back to this location.."}
{"text":"The food is great but the lady who works cashier at night has nothing but attitude. I would love to come back and eat there again but she's the reason why I won't! I came in one time and order rolled tacos and I told her instead of sour cream on top I want guacamole instead and that's all I said. When the food was ready she really told the kitchen crew to only put guacamole on top so I came back with it and ask her nicely if she could add cheese on top and she reply  with a lot of attitude and said  \"no you never said you wanted cheese you only said guacamole\" and I replied to her okay so I have to pay extra for it and she said \"no but for the next time you will know how to order\". Not only was that rude but I never told her not to put cheese or lettuces when it comes with it. If I didn't want it I would of said it. She just assumed that's how I wanted it. I didn't know I had to tell her I want cheese and lettuce on top even though it comes with it!!"}
{"text":"Same thrown together nonsense...its never better the second time..save your money or go to rivas next door...not the pre-cooked sitting on the grill crap like here..just saying..i give it two stars for being clean"}
{"text":"I've never been to any other Roberto's location other than this one, as its right by my house. Food is absolutely disgusting. However, the employees are always friendly. Always have a stomach ache after eating there. I only get a bean and cheese burrito (I'm vegetarian) but the bf loves their menudo."}
{"text":"I come into town often and I love to stop by this place.  Everything is good. Asada burritos, nachos, chicken tacos, breakfast burritos... Not only good but pretty good portions. Nice and meaty."}
{"text":"This Mexican-food lover is adding Roberto's to my top ten favorite Mexican food restaurants of all time. Yes, it is just counter-service, and the service is neither here nor there, but the food is muy bueno! Get chips and cheese (simply tortilla chips with a dusting of grated melted cheddar) and anything carnitas. The salsa bar is fresh and clean, and they have horchata and (a bit too sweet) aqua frescas."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times and it has been great. Hot, fresh and fast Mexican food.   However, because of tonight's service I will not be back. When order my chips with cheese and guacamole (on the side which I expressed twice while ordering) I was upset to find only guacamole on the side.   When I asked about it, the server shook his head and said no cheese on the side. I informed him I had ordered the same item more than fifteen times before with no issue. He just continued to shake his head and stated I never informed him to put the cheese on the side. When I stated I did twice while ordering he shook his head repeatedly and said \"No. No \". With this service I'll take my money elsewhere where people do not call me a liar."}
{"text":"I went here once and my boyfriend threw up and hour later and so did the friends we went with. I will never ever go back!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in here in several months. Got sick from the food last time I was in. I thought it was the grease.  Thought I'd give it another try as I was craving Mexican food and it's close to my home. Big mistake! The food prices have doubled and the quality has decreased. I ordered 2 beef tacos. They were not cooked enough, meat cool on the inside, taco shell half cooked. Yuk. Don't waste your time. I won't return EVER. I should have stayed away."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest restaurant in town, however, when you want some fast Mexican food, you can always count on Roberto's."}
{"text":"Tried the California Burrito.  Man, that carne asada and yummy fries sure go good together.  I will be back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"one of the better Robertos locations in las vegas when it comes to the quality of the food. The employees are friendly ad this is a great place for quality food!!1"}
{"text":"First off this is the only Robertos that I'm talking about  I'm not vouching for any other locations Most of the Robertos I've been to were hit or miss Not this one it's a hit every time morning noon or night  I love that this place is open 24 hours a day Always fresh always quick  They also have a condiment station Hot sauce,onions, jalapeños, cucumbers etc.  I get the bean and cheese burrito Chili relleno burrito chicken burrito And carne asada burrito all good  This is a Mexican fast food place  Not a restaurant there are no waitresses Go in place order get food that's it"}
{"text":"By far the worst Robertos I have been to.  Ordered four items, two of the items were wrong.  Order a chicken chimichanga and got beef.  Ordered a breakfast burrito and got something else...... not sure what!  Tried to call the number on the receipt numerous times to let them know and get replacements and no one answers the phone!  Terrible service!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and have come to this specific location many times before, but I won't be back. The later it is, the worse the food is. I found multiple pieces of something black and white plastic in my food. It was so good, but I couldn't even eat it. :("}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out. This was my third and final trip to this Roberto's. Tried the carne asada nachos this time. They spent less than a minute getting my order together. The carne asada was dried out and tasteless, the cheese was not melted, the guacamole was plopped carelessly into one corner, and the rest of it just plain sucked. Wonder if anyone checks out these franchises for quality? Do yourself a favor and pretend this location doesn't exist."}
{"text":"I grew up in San Diego, so I know what Roberto's should be.  For starters, and my main reason for only 2 stars is the Guac.  It is pretty bad when you can go to El Pollo or Islands and get better guac than a taco shop.  It should be thick and with chunks of avocado not something that almost looks like a was ran thru a blender.  The food itself, is ok but not as good as their San Diego locations.  I have yet to run into someone who is from San Diego and has eaten at the ones here, or people from Vegas who have eaten at the San Diego ones who have disagreed.  Now I do know that, the shops here are a franchise and not actually ran by Roberto's.  But they are, suppose to be following their standards."}
{"text":"Apparently a lot has changed in about a month or two that we haven't been here. Prices were raised and the quality of food went down. At least Rivas is right next door...."}
{"text":"Good food like always just the worst service. I wasn't aware it takes 20 mins to get horchata."}
{"text":"Great food. Menudo is awesome. Cant wait til next weekend to get more. So many locations throughout vegas."}
{"text":"Love their stake fries . At times the do over cooked them and taste dry but  I still love them.  All the guacamole , sour cream, beans , cheese , pico de gallo with steak and fries then add some salsa and they are delicious.  My fiance has tried tortas and they are so good too , along with the enchilada combo.   I  Recommend this place if you craving Mexican food ."}
{"text":"Havent been to a robertos in 5 yrs so i was excited to try but to my disappointment it was not as great as it used to be . The asada fries were small for the price and not as tasty as other restaurants. I suggest you try Don Tortaco they have the best asada fries double portion for $1 less."}
{"text":"Good greasy Mexican food. Just what I was wanting! Ordered the combo #1 and everything was good. Taco wasn't too greasy, enchilada had a lot of flavor and rice and beans were yummy.   My husband had the rolled tacos and they were delicious. Will definitely be coming back when I'm in the mood for some dirty Mexican food.   Oh and make sure you get a drink from the counter, we had the pineapple juice and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a milanesa torta from this place and it was horrible. The meat looked and tasted like it was old. It was tough like beef jerky but not as tasty. It was like they had fried it once before and then fried it again. Milanesa is one of those foods that don't taste good reheated and u think they'd know that but apparently they don't."}
{"text":"Food, Food, & more Food!! For so little you get so much & if they like you & ur not rude they are 100% generous. it dont even matter how good ur spanish is or how good there English is. Kindness is universal.... I love the Super nachos with carne asada no beans xtra meat & chesse AHHHHHH! so DAMN GOOD!"}
{"text":"I'm not really feeling the love for this place. This was the first Roberto's I've been to and it may be the last. I ordered guacamole here and I swear to god, it came out in a paste. A $4.00 paste, what a ripoff. It looked like they had mixed together sour cream and some green food coloring. I don't know what that was, but it was not guacamole.  The food is good, greasy, standard fare. The chips were good, but again, drenched in grease. If you're into that, okay. Nothing was remotely spicy and all the sauces felt like they were missing something, and again, greasy as hell. You're going to pay for going to this place in a gastrointestinal sense. What goes in must come out, one way or another...  I'm not really sure what the hubbub is about this place. Seems pretty standard and mediocre to me. I might try another location just to see if it's moderately better there, because this location is seriously gross - general gas station ambience, unclean tables, a grotty trash can right next to the cash register. I wanted to smother myself in hand sanitizer after I left.  Is this what passes for Mexican cuisine in Vegas?? I've got to find something better."}
{"text":"50% of the time the order is wrong. Make sure you check your order before leaving. Can't wait for the other robertos to open up off teneya and azure. It's further for me but the quality of this location has gone down hill lately. Other robertos I've eaten at are much better."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Roberto's.  I've been to others but this on is best.  The staff is very friendly and FAST.  But, the food doesn't taste like fast food, it's fresh and good.  I usually get the carne asada plate which lasts me for three meals!  The salsa verde is excellent."}
{"text":"Great location with nice outdoor patio seating, always good food and fast service. Salsa bar is always stocked and the salsa's are always amazing!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Roberto's in a while, but I was in the mood for Mexican food and since I had my dog with me, I needed to find one with a drive-through. This Roberto's has a drive-through (yay!), but the food was just as lame as I remembered it :(  I brought my meal home to eat. Good thing, because it would have been an unholy mess trying to eat my order in the car! I got a beef taco and a chicken quesadilla with guacamole. I appreciate the freshly made taco shell, but the meat was really tough. (I must say I am not a fan of shredded beef tacos, so maybe if I would have gotten ground beef, it would have been better. But I didn't see that as an option on the menu...) The quesadilla was HUGE--maybe that's how they justify the $7 (with guac) price tag. But the chicken was bland; the peppers were undercooked; and the whole thing was really greasy. I only ate half, and I didn't even give the rest of it to my dog, because I was afraid it might make him sick.  I did notice some out-of-state license plates in the parking lot while I was waiting in the drive-through, so maybe they get a lot of tourist traffic. And I do know several locals who swear by Roberto's. I guess it's just not the right Mexican food for me."}
{"text":"Spent $29 for a small portion of food, the cashier was rude and didn't say thank you or smile and basically threw my food at me her name was olga  She was behind the register eating tacos and didn't even wash her hands before she took my order  Very unprofessional and won't be eating here again ever"}
{"text":"Its Roberto's, if your a local you know it well.  It's consistent and who doesn't love Wednesdays?  It's good and fair priced and all over town. As for Mexican food, I've had better but also have had worse.  It's good, fast, and near by.    Don't know if anyone has ever bragged about it but it's WAY more authentic then other fast food 3(bell, del, &pollo)"}
{"text":"I went into this location today (11/8/16 around 3:00 PM) and ordered a chicken chimichanga.  I got about 1/3rd of the way into the chimichanga and found a 3.5\" toothpick inside of it laying horizontally.  Not only is this incredibly disgusting but its VERY dangerous as well.  Will not eat here again.  Pics: http://imgur.com/a/hfzzW"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Roberto's in the valley. They've all got their different quirks and slight variations on some menu items, but this one's got it down.   The staff is friendly, and remembers me when I come in.   Check out the Carne Asada Fries, Carnitas Burrito, California Burrito, and Cheese Enchiladas. Great stuff."}
{"text":"I'd hoped this restaurant was similar to a taco truck I'd so loved to go to in California.       Unfortunately, this resturant didn't hold up to my standards. I felt the food was of low caliber and due to the unclean bathroom, I suspected poor sanitation.       The amount of uncalled-for grease was just amazing and the characteristic rice and beans were simply unappealing and lacked flavor.       The high price just didn't seem to match the quality of the food, nor of the quality of the establishment."}
{"text":"This place is always so great! Never had a bad experience! Good food and awesome guys behind the counter!"}
{"text":"Robertos Taco Shop, open 24/7 is the place to go for a quick snack--I heard so many great things, about service, and the food.  You don't have to go to a fancy Mexican restaurant for good food, cause Roberto's not only has the taste, but their service is quick and the staff always has a smile on their face, especially the cashiers.  And if you go there often, they remember your order.  Robertos makes the grade and is 4 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this location because they have a drive-thru and it's raining and I didn't want to get out of my car and get wet.  Well I pull up to the drive-thru and I was immediately greeted with a GOOD MORNING HOW CAN I HELP YOU and I proceeded to place my order.  Before I left to drive around to the window he even gave me my total before I drove off.  Most places tell you to pull around before they give you the total so that was a plus to me.  There was a car ahead of me and it appears that they were in park waiting for their food.  I understand because they don't have pre-made food sitting around and your food is made as soon you place the order.  I was in the drive-thru for about maybe 10 minutes but it wasn't long enough for me to say \"what's taking so long\" so I was fine with that.  The gentleman that helped me was also very friendly and pleasant and gave smile when dealing with me. (+++++ for me)  Now onto the food.  I ordered a steak breakfast burrito and requested 3 of the green salsa cups.  Well the burrito is not as big as the other ones (since I'm greed) but it did hit the spot I needed it to.  There were a couple hard pieces of steak that almost killed me because my tooth is somewhat bothering me and I was almost in tears because it literally hurt that bad.  So not sure if it was because my tooth is sensitive that it appeared really hard because when I chewed on the other side it wasn't a problem. There was a balance of the meat, cheese, eggs, and potatoes which makes for a great breakfast burrito.  It was hot an warm even after I got to work and got settled.   This location is okay and I probably will come back because of the service alone. Please don't let the wait time in the drive-thru discourage you because when you place your order that is when they start to make it which is a good thing.  Some people complain about every little thing and inpatient about everything.  7-10 minutes in the drive-thru while they prepare your food isn't bad at all.  It's easy in the drive-thru but not any faster than going inside because either way they still have to prepare you food after you order it."}
{"text":"Well, I'm gonna regret this in the morning (says every person that ever ate at robertos). I don't come to these cheap taco shops anymore and now I remember why. The first thing Id have to say is terrible customer service. And that's coming from a white guy they grew up on the east side who already gets treated bad usually. I'm always nice but I guess they don't like the whedos lol.   The soft shell taco was just like I remember from the east side robertos. Taco soup. Wrap a couple napkins around your wrist before you dive into those. Don't waste your time or your toilet paper people just go to taco y taco"}
{"text":"The Chili Colorado plate special $8,95 is a no no. It's all very very hot sauce and little amounts of fat infested meat. I told the cashier (gum chewing) about this. The cooks made me wait 10 min for a new plate. Once the plate was ready, the cashier said \"they did this for me\". Who is the customer? Anyway, the dish tasted even hotter. Robertos fliers says they are customer friendly. I did not think so. Never again. On to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shop is great wherever you go and this location is no different. I like this location, though, because it's inside a Fabulous Freddy's. You can get your car washed or get gas while waiting for or eating your food. Another nice thing about this location is that it is right next to Splash. You can either buy a big drink at a low cost from the Freddy's soda machine, or you can get an equally inexpensive soda extravagance including coconut creamer and lime from Splash.  One thing I don't like about this location is that, unlike most Roberto's stores, it doesn't have a salsa bar. I like to pick up cucumbers, radishes, and carrots from the bar to enjoy with my meal. You can ask for these items and will receive them at no cost from the cashier, but you can't get your own.  Viva Roberto's!"}
{"text":"First, I love and hate the fact that there is a 24 hour taco spot right by my apartment and I'm trying to lose weight. Second, you get sooo much for not a lot which, again, adds to my trying to lose weight dilemma. I had stopped by to get three tacos (chicken & carnitas) and a #13 which is the chimichunga meal to eat for dinner. What I didn't know is that I would be getting a chimichunga the size of a baby or at least a chipotle burrito but it's real mexican food. I will definitely be going here again, although sparingly because my jeans don't fit this morning, for a Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Food is not authentic Mexican one bit. It's edible but so is Taco Bell. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but if it's late at night and you don't have many options, this will do. The customer service is also ok, not great. The drive thru speed is also a drag, if there is a long line of cars, good luck!"}
{"text":"There so sloppy here and the wait was ridiculous, every table dirty and there wait time is outrageous! The picture explains it all! Safe eating :)"}
{"text":"4 stars for food... extra star for being open in a gas station 24 hours!!!!!! had chorizo torta... wife had a couple tacos. torta was awesome. tacos were standard - solid. awesome little taco shop"}
{"text":"Not only is this place like 2 miles from my house, it's my favorite local Roberto's location. I just read down at some of the awful experiences and am honestly surprised. The food has always been great here, and it's a super clean spot! I have three kids, two of which like to run around and laugh like wild animals even when I attempt to contain them, but the staff at this location engages with my kids. There is one lady who is always there who is just the sweetest. My daughter likes to go up on her own with my debit card and pay for churros after the meal, and this lady just smiles at her like she's the best thing on the planet. So for good food, clean digs, and sweet service, why all the sad panda reviews? We'll continue to populate this spot for more than just location, location, location."}
{"text":"Always one of my go to spots for awesome food that reminds me of being home in So Cal. The carne asada fries are hands down my favorite, but the fish tacos and tortas are amazing too!"}
{"text":"I typically eat here after a night of heavy drinking. It's good"}
{"text":"When I feel the need for some greasy and thick mexican food..I head straight to Roberto's!! Whichever location you choose, you can't go wrong..they all have the same taste.  I always get the #4 combo plate..2 hard shell beef tacos w/ rice and beans.  Price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give.  I really like the fact that they are open 24hrs also so after a night of clubbin, it soaks up all the alcohol! :)"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience i have had at a Roberto's the meat tasted old and dry like it was made during lunch, and it seemed like it was 2 kinds of meat the chopped carne asada and pulled beef.  My husbands chimmi had way too much grease like they took it straight from the grease to plate not shaking excess grease from cooking off. My husband asked for his sour cream on the side because he does not eat it but i like extra and they put it on the side and the top so he scraped it off. The restaurant looked like it needed cleaned like they opened and just didn't tend to the dinning room. The server was not friendly and like sat our food where you get your sauces instead of either waiting for me to get up to the counter or just bringing it out. I will don't be coming back to this location ever! This is not the quality of food or service that i am use to getting at a roberto's. This location needs to do better because it can ruin the reputation of the other restaurants."}
{"text":"Located inside a Fabulous Freddys...this location makes for a busy spot when it's open (not 24 hrs).  On a previous occasion, I sent BW inside to purchase the meal, while I waited outside.  Now that BW was out and about, I had to park in a very busy parking lot and step inside to place an order around the witching hour that is the dinner rush.  The service was friendly enough, better than most Robertos I have visited.  I placed an order that I have eaten since my teens dining on Robertos in Cali.  It consists of a carne asada burrito with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream.  In addition, on most occasions, I also include a quesadilla because I love them.  After purchase, I stood around and observed the others standing around waiting for their orders.  I had seen while waiting in line, some rather intricate orders being placed while others were right off the menu.  An mix mash of the human circus.  I waited. I waited some more.  There was no sauce bar...you know, the kind with sauces, radishes, onions, and that spicy carrot & onion bar to keep you company while you wait.  Eventually, my order came up.  I bolted home to consume my meal.  Given the close proximity to the house, the meal traveled well. I found the quality to be that I have come to expect from Robert's.  All this being said...if one tickles the flat screen of the yelp app....I guarantee you will find better suitors of your taste buds in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"It used to be a treat to eat at this establishment on an infrequent basis.  Now that I am in the immediate area on a daily basis, I takes everything I have not to eat here everyday.  The service is quick and friendly.  At times it seems busy and you might not get a table, but this has never happened to me.  The hot sauce bar contains both a delicious red and green variation.  The radishes, cucumbers, onions, the spicy carrots are all super fresh.  Every experience has involved carne asada in either a burrito, fry or nacho configuration.  The carne is lean and tasty on what every platform it is served on.  This particular Robertos Taco Shop is the best RTS I have been to in the valley!  Let me say that again..Este particular Robertos Taco Shop es el mejor RTS he estado en el valle!"}
{"text":"Best location of Roberto's, my special order has always been correct and delicious. Very consistent. The staff is prompt and friendly. My go-to spot for quick and quality Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My son talked me into visiting Roberto's Taco Shop for some Carne Asada Fries. I have to admit, I was impressed with this location in comparison to some others I have seen in town. The restaurant was clean and had a wide selection of seating. The fresh veggies bar had an enormously generous portion of cut carrots, cucumbers, onions, and sauces from mild to hot.   My son enjoyed his meal, and I really enjoyed my marinated carrots and horchata! If you haven't tried a horchata, it is a refreshing rice based Mexican drink made with milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla that is served over ice. This is a must try item!"}
{"text":"Place is okay but I'm a little shocked I got charged 1.70 to add onions and cilantro in my burrito I understand the charge for rice and beans but 1.70 for onion and cilantro is a bit much"}
{"text":"Called in for a Togo order and I asked the guy, David, what kind of shrimp dinners they have. He says, \"All we have is a shrimp burrito.\" I say, \"Well.....I thought there was garlic shrimp.\" He says, \"Oh yeah, there's that and the burrito. I agree to the garlic shrimp even though I wanted ranchero. But, David insisted that it doesn't exist. I get there and see ranchero on the menu. I was totally pissed and the level of customer service was so low that I never return. To add insult to injury, David says he's the manager. Pitiful!"}
{"text":"Great for a late night snack or meal! Decent Mexican food and cheap prices. I have had the chicken tacos, breakfast burritos, tamales and shredded beef tostada. So far it has been good. The register person is usually just there to take your order and get your food to you. Don't expect much else because you are not paying much for the food or service. 99 cent chicken tacos on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Roberto's that I have ever visited, I will not come back here again for lunch due to the slow service. Avoid this location for lunch at all cost"}
{"text":"Disgusting! I ordered the carne asada fries and buried deep within hair inside the food. Just gross! Walked right back in n showed it to them. Poor service, poor food quality. Lost my support"}
{"text":"Good food able to get custom orders correct no matter how complicated. I ordered 4 items all with different changes and they were all correct. Fast service and very friendly."}
{"text":"I am in Heaven right now! My grandmother passed away over 10 years ago and this is the first place with good that taste just like hers. I am in love and can't wait to have their food again (and again and again and again)!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 beef taco combination & 2 tamales. Got home with 2 chicken tacos & 1 tostada. NOT Even CLOSE TO WHAT WE ORDERED."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's! The fact that they are open 24 hours makes it my number 1 choice after a night out. The California burrito, rolled tacos and carne asana burrito are my favorites. Very fast service and such a great value! I will probably never go to chipotle or qdoba again after discovering Roberto's."}
{"text":"I ordered a chili relleno burrito to go. There was no one in the place. When I got home my burrito was filled with meat. Mind you I don't eat meat. Such lack of customer service. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Super good! The rolled tacos are crunchy and full! Not just fried tortilla. Every time I've been there the dining area and bathroom are super clean. Portions are perfect, not too much. Staff very friendly. One of our favorite places to go anytime of day or night."}
{"text":"Papas & eggs burrito with a bit of cheese and pico.  Enjoying sitting outside, hanging with family & friends, and splitting this very large burrito!"}
{"text":"This is the best Roberto's in town, hands down! Their food is very fresh and the dining room is sparkly clean. Granted we do go late at night when there's few people, but I can always count on this location to serve great food when I have random cravings. Not sure why it has such low ratings but it's delicious food, a clean restaurant, and friendly service."}
{"text":"I love this location because it's right down the street from me. It's clean and they have cheap food. It always hits the spot and I haven't gotten sick, which is a plus considering the cheap prices. The location is kind of small and has very limited seating."}
{"text":"I been in drive thru for 15 minutes and once I got to the window I still had to wait an extra 15, worst robertos ever & the worst part is there is only 2 people!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't like robertos at all really,  but it's a local favorite and I have been here so so many times.  My husband would eat here every day I think.  Yuck. Not my thing at all"}
{"text":"We always come to this location because they seem to be the nicest and food is definitely the freshest. The super nachos are one of our favorites.  But im a huge chile relleno fan . So when im being lazy to make some i turn to this robertos :=) the chicken tacos are always flavorful and juicy. The asada meat is really.yummy too"}
{"text":"I didn't like the food or atmosphere here.  It seemed kind of dirty which I unwisely ignored initially...but then I got my burrito which tasted kind of dirty if that makes sense.  Best word to describe this place is sloppy.  The food isn't fresh nor are the salsas...overall a big dissapointment b/c I saw this place all over Vegas for weeks and I was like hmmm i gotta try that before I leave it MUST be good..unfortunately NOT...oh yeah and it made my bf sick so we def won't be back...  :("}
{"text":"Roberto's never disappoints. Great food consistently. This happens to be my favorite location. Anytime day or night you're gonna get fresh, delicious food.  The staff is really nice. I do find the painting under the counter very interesting. Why does the senior at the door have a butcher knife?"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly, food is always good, I personally love the chile reino burrito. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Terrible! My bacon, egg,cheese, potato breakfast burrito had maybe 2 pieces of potato in it. The bacon was waaaay under cooked and it was probably made with 1 egg. The carne asada nachos were very bare and burned/over fried chips.  Definitely never coming back. This is the same place I got a bandaid in my burrito a few years ago. I should have learned my lesson then!!"}
{"text":"Todo es perfecto en esta locacion menos Faviola una cajera mexicana con complejo de Accionista de Wall Street que regaña a los cocineros por no ponerle un kilo de frijol y arroz a los burritos, 20dlls 3 burritos que mas bien parecian mulas flacas hahahah enserio con eso hubiera comprado 3 libras de steak."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant with great service from Jose he was friendly and professional! Ordered the pcarne asada fries which I thought were the best I've had in town. I highly recommend this location. Thank you Jose and the chef in the back for the great experience"}
{"text":"Delicious, as usual. Everything I've had has always been good. My favs are anything Carne Asada (burrito, torta, taco), chicken taco, beef tamale and chicken enchilada. Can't go wrong and the low prices keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Upon our first visit my husband and I both ordered the carne asada burrito. It was a very large portion served with rice and refried beans. It was so good! You can tell that they make the food fresh and it was delicious. Also, it's pretty hard to beat $1 chicken tacos on Wednesdays. xD"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for the past couple of years without issue. As of recent, they have a new guy at the front counter who cannot seem to get the orders right. My order is pretty simple. I always get the five rolled tacos with extra guac and extra cheese with no pico. So why did I get five rolled tacos with next to nothing of the items I asked for and a huge amount of pico with extra onions. This has happened a couple of times. Please beware of this and check your order before you leave the store."}
{"text":"Sometimes you get an undeniable craving for a lengua burrito. If you don't mind your walk-in order taking ten minutes without a line, this might be the place for you!  If you really like lengua with cilantro and onions, you're set. Because that's what this burrito is: an arm-sized burrito stuffed with nothing but lengua, cilantro, and onions. But if you want a burrito, maybe look elsewhere- not sure why there weren't any vegetables, beans, rice, cheese, guac, etc on my burrito at all and the menu doesn't really say anything to explain it. On the bright side, I didn't have to worry about filler bites with just rice and lettuce or anything, but this wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered a burrito.  The salsa bar up front is stocked with radishes, onions, jalapenos, and various salsas- the green and red were both better than I expected, and I preferred the red. Wish I'd gotten more."}
{"text":"I love me some Roberto's. Their rolled tacos are delish! Especially covered in cheese, sour cream, and guac! The chicken and beef are equally as good, although I may like the beef a bit more. Their taco salad is super yummy, but the juices of the meat tend to make the bottom of the taco shell bowl a little TOO soggy, which is a bummer. The quesadillas are yummy too, especially with a side of rice and beans. I gave this location a 4 cause they tend to be out of something almost every time I go, but that doesn't take away from the deliciousness of their food."}
{"text":"And then they figured I don't speak Spanish. So I order over the phone. They tell me 20 minutes later I show up 20 minutes later and they start when I walk in?! I then ask them how much longer the lady said in a minute... Walks back and says \"chingado\" telling the chef that I'm waiting and I'm impatient .... Smh I do speak Spanish fluent yet choose not to. A little disappointing BC they were talking about me as I'm waiting right there at the counter. I don't know if I'll come back to this location."}
{"text":"They have refilled everything, I ha e been in three more times and each time the carrots and radishes are fresh and filled and they were cleaning."}
{"text":"Worst Robertos taco shop EVER!!  Salsa disgusting, so watered down it doesn't even have taste.  The Red salsa tasted like dirty dish water.  The green salsa had absolutely zero flavor and was like soup broth.  Tonight I ordered 2 chicken tacos and a bean and cheese burrito wet.  Everything was wrong even though she repeated my order correctly when handing me my bag she clearly did not check what she was putting inside the bag which was unfortunate for me to get home and find the incorrect order.  When I got home my tacos had lettuce even though I ordered no lettuce.  Then I open what should be my burrito which was another order entirely.  An enchilada, beef taco beans and rice.  I decide to eat the enchilada which was awful.  Tortilla wrapped with cheese inside that was not melted at all and covered in a sauce over a completely raw tortilla.  The beef taco was so dry and had only a tiny speck of meat in a ball in just the middle of the taco.  Do not eat here Ever!  Go to another location this place is the worst Robertos"}
{"text":"WHERE DO I START... well let's start with the idiot workers!!!! Came in on 12/22/16 at 5pm to get breakfast burritos and came home to the potatoes being undercooked in all of them! So I called the idiot guy and he answers so nonchalant and says \"umm... well.. ok.. we...can..like...make..a..new...one\" like are you that f**** slow???? I felt like I was talking to a damn wall so I go back to get my burrito re made and he doesn't even greet me just with a straight face asks what do I want. Like where's the customer service??? Who hires these employees I want to know because the front cashier boy is a perfect example of someone who hates their job and acts like a dumbass on purpose. So then I ask him to put cheese INSIDE of on the burritos and I get the food back and I get the cheese in a CUP. Like are you retarded??? So then I told him \"I asked for it inside but okay thanks\" and he looks at me all dumb blank stare \"oh\" yeah that's IT. OH?!!! I'm so mad I can't believe this place is still running like this. SUCH A SHAME. Don't go here unless you wanna talk to a dumb wall"}
{"text":"When you click the stars for two stars its says \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"   that pretty much says it all."}
{"text":"I think this place is good for that quick take out on the way home from work. I will say the food was good and fresh and at a reasonable price. This is a newer location with a large open window to look into the kitchen as your food is being prepared.   Now here is the bad part and the reason behind the loss of stars. The prep cook was dicing tomatoes all the while he had a phone between he shoulder and ear. Ding ding Health code violation and on that note the new regulations state that no employee can prepare food with bare hands. Well not one employee had gloves on. This is a big NO-NO as I am in the restaurant business.   For now I will go to the Roberto's on Blue Diamond as i have never seen them break this many health code violations."}
{"text":"Food is good. There are better locations in town. I like the carne asada fries or the California burrito."}
{"text":"The food is good but the past few times I have been they have messed up my order.  No one speaks English and I don't hablo so I find myself repeating my order several times. Yet somehow my order is still incorrect."}
{"text":"I've never had any issues with Roberto's. This one is closest to my newest place and they always treat me well here and very fresh food! They are really fast here, which is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"So first of all.. the cashier needs to smile.... your face made is making my mood not so good. Get your shit together and atleast fake like you like being there. I asked a simple question and it's like lip. I only come here cause it's close to my place but I think imma go else where. You guys should really hire motivated people that ACTUALLY like working there."}
{"text":"Good food and clean facility but make sure you spell your order out because I swear I can write this shit on a piece of paper and they would still get it wrong."}
{"text":"Hmmm..it's hard trying to write this review. I mean, it's Roberto's, come on. This particular location looks better, appearance wise. It's open 24 hours and I've always had good experiences at other Roberto's. My son normally eats Roberto's too but on this particular night, he refused to eat here. Was it a sign?   I ordered a shredded beef burrito and it was completely soggy and leaking when I received it. It resembled a stew burrito. I wasn't even halfway done with it when it started coming completely apart. That's a first. I got fed up and just took the rest home. I went to bed and my husband ate what was left of the burrito.  The next morning we both woke up and we were sick. I'm pretty sure it was the food since my son was the only one who refused to eat here and he was fine and dandy. I'll probably give them another try but my first experience here was very unpleasant."}
{"text":"You know I come here for their breakfast burritos and I really enjoy them the bacon is great for the price and the size is big."}
{"text":"I have been going to Robertos since it opened the restaurant is always clean  . The food fresh and the  the employees very friendly.  I have tried  almost everything on the menu and the food  I  have eaten"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, and the quality of it is good. All the employees are cool EXCEPT the one older man. Probably 40, 50 year old Mexican dude. He's a f!@#$ing creep which is why I gave this place 2 stars. I'd gone here a number of times with my husband and have seen the creepy man, but he was always normal when my husband was with me. Well this particular day, I was alone. I just was ordering a big order for my family and I and the creepy tio took my order and rung me up. The WHOLE time, he gives me this creepy, pervy smile, no blinking, no words to me except thank you, and he was looking me up and down like I was a piece of meat. He just stood there at the register while I pretended to not notice his weird behavior. I sat down at the tables far away from him as possible and was pretending to look at my phone the whole time 'cause I just wanted my mf food.  Look, I'm just a fat chick  who was wearing MC Hammer pants and a loose t-shirt with some greasy ass hair. I just wanted some damn burritos. Could you fire this guy or tell him to grow up or something ya'll???  I drive to the Roberto's on Lake Mead where the cops always are instead now. I'd rather go to the ghetto Roberto's than see the old creepy old perv ever again."}
{"text":"Robertos Taco shop being 24 hours is just brilliant!  They have wonderful fresh guacamole that I always order extra of!  The meat is always fresh and tasty, I also love their tortillas.  I have went all different times and whichever staff it might be are always friendly, the restaurant is always clean, and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! Amazing hangover spot. Always good service and the side section is fully loaded. Tables are clean and neat as well as food being prepared and served in a decent time! Highly recommended. No complaints to be honest."}
{"text":"Awesome food, best Robertos since San Diego.  Very, very clean....food is great and so reasonable,  best in Vegas! !!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever eating a fried cockroach..  unwillingly. I called the location and they didn't respond to doing anything about it. Can the owner please message me."}
{"text":"This location is by far the best Roberto's inall of Las Vegas. The friendliest staff the cleanest restaurant and best food"}
{"text":"Roberto's is my all time fave! My two absolute favorite menu items are: Carne Asada Nachos and the Shrimp Cocktail (spicy). This location has definitely been one of the best ones I've been to. Not only is it in a great location, but there's an awesome patio to sit at. Go check them out if you haven't yet...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love how a taco shop that originated in San Diego ended up having three times the number of locations in Las Vegas.  Maybe it's because they realized the untapped potential of the drunk Mexican food market in the desert.  Maybe it's because they just can't compare to Mexican food in SD (ok this isn't really a maybe, it's true...more on this in a second).  In the end, I still appreciate that it's around.  Basically, the only time I've ever come here is one of two alternatives: (1) after getting back from a bender on the Strip or (2) after a bender the night before, struggling with hunger in the morning, and realizing that it's the cheapest and fastest food option available.  Regardless of the scenario, it always gets the job done.  Solid enough California burrito and super fries.  And most importantly, cheap!  But remember, don't expect the best Mexican food ever here.  You're only here because you needed to have Mexican food or else you would've died."}
{"text":"My friend and I were famished and craving Mexican food on our way back from a day trip to Death Valley National Park, which is beautiful but doesn't have the greatest restaurant scene.  Middling-at-best Yelp reviews steered us away from the Mexican eateries in Pahrump, and we initially stopped at another Mexican place that advertised being open but wasn't at 5:15 p.m. on a Sunday. I'd expected I'd have to settle at Roberto's, but I can't imagine anything else we'd have visited would be better.  The size of my chicken burrito surprised me, given that it costs less than $4. The chicken wasn't too dry, yet the burrito wasn't greasy or otherwise overly filled with fat. The restaurant has one type of red salsa -- a really spicy one, which I liked. I ordered a bean tostada, not knowing that the burrito alone could have been divided into two meals. The tostada, too, was a great value at less than $3.   Our food was served quickly; it no doubt helped that we were the only two people in the restaurant. My only quibbles with the place are that a.) the styrofoam cup I was given for my water was tiny, and b.) the only napkins available are the ones you're eventually given with your food. I spilled on myself at the salsa bar and had to wait to clean up.  Roberto's is open 24 hours, which would have come in more handy for me back when I worked nights. It's good to see there's a quality option for those who do work different hours."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Always smiling. Clean place and as always, delicious food at really good prices.. Couldn't think of a better spot for football game food or late night munchies"}
{"text":"Although the employees are still friendly, the food quality has deteriorated (mainly the beef).  I'm a Roberto's fan, but will drive past this one after trying it three times in the two months."}
{"text":"Recently raised their prices.  Its just not worth the price now for cheap mexicsn takeout.  I used to come here as often as 3 times a week, but even the service seems to have suffered.  The few people taking orders are short tempered and overall just give a bad experience (particularily the short lady that takes orders occasionally).  I might be able to deal with prices getting raised a lot, the orders that are taken wrong, the new rule of no substitutions even on things that are allergy related, but the bad service makes me just want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is okay - but it takes forever. Like way too long. I order cheese enchiladas, and the cheese is never melted. The chicken ones are great - but don't order mix of anything for a to go order.... They will mess it up."}
{"text":"It was a sad day when my other favorite taco shop closed down, but then I found Roberto's Taco Shop just down the street and things started looking up again. Another 24 hour local taco shop to satisfy your cravings at any hour of the day or night...whether you want a breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, potatoes and any meat you like (chorizo, bacon, or sausage) or you rather come in for lunch and get a carne asada or carnitas burrito, or a late night snack of fish tacos, then you have found your place.   The service is fast and they have a serve yourself salsa bar with both green and red salsa and of course their selection of pickled carrots and jalapenos.  One item that I know I want to try on the menu is their carne asada fries...definitely something that I used to get back in LA and San Diego at all the local taco shops."}
{"text":"Wednesday night \"dollar\" chicken tacos are incredible. They used to be a dollar but now they are dollar and some change. Still absolutely amazing tacos.  The cheese is incredibly fresh, so good. They are always friendly when we come in and the food has always been amazing. We have also had their burritos and carne asada fries. Both were so good."}
{"text":"Had chicken rolled tacos for lunch. Ice machine was out of ice. Sour cream and guacamole had an off taste, like bitter and left over from a few days earlier. Stomach has been upset ever since.  Won't go back here again. Definitely not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Sucks because half the time it's great and the other half its terrible. I order a specific item a certain way and they often mess it up! All in all pretty good#"}
{"text":"Roberto's is what it is. However this Roberto's is very nice and clean! The staff is always helpful and friendly. The Carne Asada is yummy. The tacos are great, and the tortas are fresh and tasty. I love that they always make your meal when you order it. This location doesn't have a drive-through, but that's OK, I'm not so lazy that I can't get out of my car and go inside. Come here and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"While the menu and quality of food might be typical \"Roberto's\", this location is definitely one of the newer and cleaner locations. Thus, the additional star.  Got food to go tonight...the #4 (two beef tacos) w/ beans and rice, a cheese quesadilla, and CARNE ASADA FRIES!!  The fries NEVER disappoint since they're always cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong?  Its a Robertos, inside a gas station.....first I ordered my delicious breakfast burrito with bacon and extra cheese... and then I go and get my favorite beverage - Gatorade G2....     Perfect combination.      The breakfast burrito was as expected... Tasty for the midnight craving that it was and always at the right price.... definitely had to get on my bike the next day to work that one off !!"}
{"text":"Came here so many times within a week, love the breakfast burrito so much, watched the cooks making them, and cashiers are very nice too! Will try their other dishes too!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Roberto's we have visited.  Breakfast burrito mostly potatoes very little egg and bacon. Then the nerve to charge 2.75 for pico on burrito. Never again at this location."}
{"text":"35+ years of patronizing Roberto's in San Diego and in Las Vegas is now finished. Why?  Roberto, you can thank your employees at the shop located on Cactus (just East of So. Highlands Parkway), in Las Vegas.   Earlier this month (March, 2015) while waiting for my food, a female employee began vigorously sweeping the entry rug located INSIDE the front door.  She swept in the direction of the condiment island and the service counter, all the while oblivious to the cloud of dust she was creating in the room. In a matter of seconds, the entire room was engulfed in dust.  It was so bad, in fact, that I was compelled to go outside, where I could breathe.   Not only did the dust settle on the condiment cart and its contents, but it migrated into the kitchen where my food was being prepared. NOTHING was said by any employee about the dust cloud as it lingered in the kitchen AND SETTLED ON MY FOOD. It was DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING DISGUSTING!  This experience has led to my loss of confidence and trust in the cleanliness of Roberto's shop and the safe preparation of food at this location. It has also caused me to doubt the manner in which Roberto's other shops are being operated.   Hasta la vista Roberto!"}
{"text":"The girl tonight was horrible rude.... flipped me off called me a bitch in front of everyone."}
{"text":"Well I think this Business is not going to last much longer, they had just raised their prices and the quality of the food has changed. Charge more and give less. I can understand them raising prices but the combos were raised about 3.00 more! Not worth it anymore. Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wanted chinese food but ended up here. I heard this place is great when you're drunk but when I walked in, I was fully sober. I walked up to the counter and tried to decide what I wanted. After long decision, I ordered the chicken roll ups and a burrito for 6.65. I ate the roll ups and they were beyond dry. I could of dipped them in water and could of been still thirsty. They had a little sauce station which I grabbed some sauces but that didn't help. The burrito was at least juicy but it was over packed with chicken. Apparently it had bell peppers and onions but all it was dryish chicken. The plus was it was authentic food. The walls were all painted different colors and none had an outlet so that was a negative. With it being 24/7, it would probably be better if I was drunk."}
{"text":"The two younger Latin girls who work the drive-through in the middle of the day. Have the absolute worst attitude anything you ask them they act like they're doing you the biggest favor. I understand this is not a five-star restaurant but still customer service should still be a priority..."}
{"text":"I have gone in twice in the last week with my girlfriend and gotten the worst service at any Roberto's ever. We've gotten dirty looks from every employee and cursed at under their breath in Spanish. The last Cali burrito I ordered was about half the size of any I've gotten from other locations. This place is a horrible experience all around I would not recommend coming here ever. Zero stars should be a rating."}
{"text":"Drive thru Roberto's !!! I love their bean and cheese burrito... But those spicy pickled carrots is what I think makes it the best! I could eat those carrots all day, every day!!!!! Roberto's for life!!!"}
{"text":"I know I know! I disliked Roberto's because I felt that there food was too oily. However, these past few days I have been binging on some food and I can't believe how much I fell in love with the chicken tacos! I can't believe they are so darn good and crispy fried! In addition, the chicken rolled tacos was even more filthy delicious considering it was slapped on with avocado sauce and sour cream.    Yes, I am reverting back to liking Mr. Roberto's!"}
{"text":"I have never had such a bad experience at any of the many Roberto's I have patronized over the years. Alejandra (at least that's what she said her name was) should NOT, under any circumstance be in any area involving customer service. She is extremely rude and obviously does not know or hasn't been trained properly in resolving  simple customer issues. I understand that maybe no one within this company cares that they lose my business, after all it's just one customer. It's just a shame that one person can ruin what I assume the original owners worked so hard to accomplish."}
{"text":"I always give this place a shot when I say never again and everytime they fail me once more. Ordered Rice and the lady gave me Fries. Gross"}
{"text":"Reminds me of LA's Albertos, Umburtos, Albertitas, etc, etc.  I love those joints so this place was great for me.  Standard taco shop salsa bar.  Just as it should be."}
{"text":"Went for a late night snack, the person taking the order could not get it straight, when it finally looked like he had gotten the order right, they gave it to us.  The cheese queso was so oily and greasy it was disgusting, I asked for a chicken queso with just chicken and cheese no veggies and got a load of onions and peppers.  My brother in law got a steak taco that was soaked with water.  I will never eat at this horrible location again and we are fans of Robertos.  Honestly all these mess ups it is hard to believe was coincidence considering I never have had these troubles at the other."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh Roberto's - how I miss thee!!!!  Decided to stop here because we were hungry. Oh - don't forget to get the churros!!!   I got the Carne Asada with rice and beans. It. was. magical. I also got a churro, which was equally fantastic. Roberto's is one of those places where you go for drunk food, dinner, breakfast, doesn't matter: ANYtime is good to go! Many of the locations are also 24/7, so you don't lack for access.  The food is not too greasy, the meat is good, and the lettuce and cheese was fresh. I love Roberto's and cannot wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE WORST Roberto's EVER! I literally live 4 minutes away. Ordered $60 worth of food over the phone. By the time i got there (4 mins later), the counter person was just bagging up my order..... Perfect ? No. 4 minute drive back home.... All 3 burritos were not only bland, but ICE COLD! The burrito shells were crumbling, as well. My wife ordered a chicken taco salad, but where was the chicken? Probably still in the kitchen of Roberto's. To top it all off, one of my kids ordered beef tacos, which actually looked great - until he picked them up. There were runnier than undercooked eggs. I've seriously never seen such a liquified taco. They couldn't even get the subtleties right - i.e. pico or no pico. My stomach as well as my wallet are in much pain right now, and my family is left unsatisfied. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one! I will never dine with them again."}
{"text":"A 24 Hour Taco Shop?  Yes please!!!  Robertos is near the Majestic Softball Park and an awesome place to grab a bite to eat in between games!  I got the #4 Fish Taco Combo with an extra fish taco.  My belly was happy, happy.  My son got the carne asada fries, which were so large that he could not finish them.  My hubby and daughter got carne asada tacos which they loved.  Definately a great place to chill out in the A/C and have a great, cost effective meal.  Clean bathroom, nice staff and awesome food."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they get my order wrong. I swore I would never go here again but I was stupid and decided to try it again. And you know what they messed it up again. The staff here are incompetent and don't understand their own menu or what vegetarian means.   Will never go to a Roberto's again."}
{"text":"Greesy drunk food, nothing more, why are you reading this? if you are drunk, eat here at 3am, you wont regret it...well maybe you will"}
{"text":"Walked in and placed my order. Asked for green sauce and limes with my order. Was told they had no limes. I then said no thanks, I'll cancel my order. There was 3 people in line behind me and when I turned to walk away the clerk said to the rest of the people in line, \"Can you believe this guy?\" They continued to laugh at me as I walked out.  I felt disrespected all because you didn't have any limes and I canceled my order? For that, I will NEVER spend my hard earned money in this store ever again."}
{"text":"Always quick and good food. Service could get a little better though. Employees always seem like they're hassled to have to take your order."}
{"text":"Terrible unfriendly service in an empty restaurant. Who do you people think you are? All out of a job soon I hope."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is great and they're always extremely nice except recently the lady who took my order was immensely rude. I've been to this Robertos well over 10 times and every time I ask for a water cup I've been given one. This time, the lady who took my order said \"we don't have water cups but you can buy a water bottle.\" To which I replied with \"that's odd because I was given a water cup last time.\" And then she proceeded to roll her eyes at me and ask if my order was complete. Lucky enough there are two Robertos in the town I live in and I'll never go back to this certain location again."}
{"text":"So this review is super late, but I couldn't just not give this place the love it deserves.  I went here last week Saturday during my weekend trip to Las Vegas. I was kind of nervous, because the location I went to is located inside a gas station, but my dad said it was really one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas. And boy, he was right!  I was pretty hungover from my previous night on the strip, so I ordered menudo. I was surprised by the huge size & the price ($6.95). It also came with flour or corn tortillas, cilantro & onion. I've never had menudo from a fast food restaurant, and I'm very impressed with how delicious it was. It was very meaty & had a good amount of hominy as well. It definitely helped with my massive hangover! LOL!  The next morning, my sister & I went in again for breakfast burritos. We ordered the chorizo with egg, and added potatoes. They also came with red & green chile, which was pretty delicious as well. These burritos were MASSIVE, and we could've probably just split one between us. I could only finish about half of mine...They were seriously the size of Chipotle burritos! And delicious! I also loved that they had a drive-thru. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Being so close to home, I really really wish this location was better. It's trash. I've been consistently disappointed. The cheese is never melted, I've been given nacho plates that are half full with chips, nachos with an insane amount of sour cream, breakfast burritos so thin I could lace my shoes with them, gotten insanely sick from their child relleno, and many more defects that made me raise an eyebrow at least   I'm giving it more than one star because the staff is pretty personable, nice people, but I'm shocked to see another review here where they use the word \"consistent\", it's anything but"}
{"text":"Don't forget Wednesday's are .99 hard shell shredded chicken taco nights. You wont see any advertising or p.o.p, but all locations in Vegas offer when asked."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I ever ate.  I did not even give it to my DOG... We got the chicken burrito the chicken was hard and chewy.  We also had the carne asada french fries the steak was all fat and we could not even chew it... That was a HUGE waste of $12.  Oh did I mention that they charged an extra $1 for cheese on the burrito that had a little sprinkle on it.... DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"Not all Roberto's are equal. . there is another one close enough on Gibson where you can just pass this location by.  Why you ask . . . . very simply:  1.  They charge for refills on drinks - others do not 2.  On $1 taco Wednesday, the only do this for the hard shell taco.  Other locations let you have the soft tacos also for $1. 3.  The taco's here are GREASY and don't taste the same as other locations.  The hard taco was more like the type of taco you'd get at Jack-in-the-box where they deep fry the taco in oil with the meat inside.  I've NEVER had something like this from a Roberto's.  It appears that things are slipping a bit and the lack of attention is hard to ignore.  Maybe you expanded too quickly and simply can't \"police\" your own locations.  Time to hire someone to pay closer attention to the details."}
{"text":"Roberto's is a go to here in NV. It's decent for the price and like most of it's counterparts this one is open 24/7 great for late night breakfast burrito runs. This spot is close by and kept clean. As far as i know the menu is the same as all the other ones. It's great for when you need to dine on a budget or if you are in the area and craving something that's good on the tummy & the wallet."}
{"text":"I love this place I come here quite often but I've came here twice now and each time I just got so sick. I had a very bad upset stomach and was throwing up. I was and still am very disappointed. I didn't even eat that much here."}
{"text":"I shoulda known better when you buy food from a gas station restaurant.  However the menu looked decent with lots of quick service Mexican food offering's and reasonable prices.  My girl kept telling me stories about how the Roberto's Super Nachos are \"Bomb\" when you have belly full of beer and blurry vision and need a moment to sober up.  I was neither of the two at the time and now I understand why you would need to be in that state of mind to enjoy slop like this.    The nachos were decent with real chunks of steak (i think) and layered with beans, guac, cheese, sour cream on a bed of homemade tortilla chips.  I was concerned that they came out luke warm when I began consuming them right in the seating area.  I hope I don't pay the price later on with a bubbly tummy.  I guess I will keep you updated.    I was really surprised at how busy the location was.  They had a continuous flow of customers the entire time I was there so that is a good sign of having fresh food often.  My reservations of eating at a gas station restaurant might be diminishing slightly."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Roberto's is a franchise and I love their food in general - but this particular location stands out and I've had the best food here. Their food quality is consistent! Some other locations had good days and bad days on the food depending on who's in the kitchen, but the Cheyenne location has been nothing but good days for me.   And they are the only location in Vegas that I've found to have POLLO ASADO, not just shredded chicken. I don't eat beef so having the option of pollo asado fries is amazing! Thanks Cheyenne Robertos!"}
{"text":"Had two fish tacos and a beef taco. Not very good. The lady working was friendly, about the only positive. Can't wait to get back to O'Side for real fish tacos."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant over 25 times and have never been disappointed!  Excellent food, customer Service and relaxing atmosphere.  Enchiladas are scrumptious and the carne asada is tender.  The \"expecting\" mother who runs the cash register goes above and beyond every time I see her.  God bless her and her new baby!"}
{"text":"Rude night cashier!!!!  All co-workers and I used to go multiple times a week.  I then took Family out one night and horrible customer service.  None of us will be back!  Order incorrect and because they were out of water cups, they charged me full price for a Cup."}
{"text":"I'm NEVER disappointed when I come here to eat. The food is delicious and plentiful. The customer service is always top notch, they're always pleasant and welcoming. If you haven't tried this place, I HIGHLY recommend you do!"}
{"text":"You know the food is good when you're choking and you still continue to eat. Luckily the delicious food I continued to hoover up, dislodged whatever I was choking on. Talk about a crisis averted! (True story)   All jokes aside, I was actually hesitant (reluctant) to dine here. I wasn't really looking forward to a stomach ache. I feel so stupid now. The food was good!! Don't get me wrong, it's not gourmet or fine-dining - but I can definitely see myself having a late-night-taco-craving and making my way back here. No doubt.   I enjoyed their salsa bar and went to town on everything they offered:  - Pickled whole spicy jalapeños and carrots - Salsa verde (green)  - Salsa picante (red)  - Sliced radish  - Whole stalks of green onions   Here's what we ordered: Combo #14: Chile relleno and cheese enchilada with rice and beans $7.95 - Flavor rating: 4/5. Not a bad choice at all. Simple, comforting and tasted like it's supposed to.   Combo #4: 2 crispy fried tacos plate with one chicken and one beef and rice and beans $6.90 - Flavor rating: 3/5. The chicken had the better overall flavor, but the fried taco shell was too hard for me to bite into and the beef filling in the other taco was a little too dried out. I wouldn't recommend ordering the tacos fried.   Also I ordered a fried fish taco a la cart $2.75 - Flavor rating: 4/5. Great refreshing flavor with a crispy fish. I actually enjoyed this taco the most out of everything I tried. The only issue I had was that the corn tortilla was flimsy and it broke apart right after the first bite. It's cool, I didn't mind getting a fork and spoon involved.   For $20, did I stuff myself silly? You bet I did. This place is cheap, open 24 hours, great service and satisfies the naughty Mexican food cravings. I'll add it to my list of trusted-late-night-eateries."}
{"text":"The guy that works during the day as cashier and food prep cutting lettuce and making the Chicken Tacos is RUDE ! He's a older guy with like a mild beard. He throws a attitude as you order and also when you ask for a recpiet WTF ! At times he doesn't wash his hands."}
{"text":"roberto's was my first encounter with mexican taco shops especially with carne asada fries. and for me i stopped getting their fries because the fries get soggy quick and i dont like that it comes with tomatoes. but this last visit, i went with a couple of classmates and they recommend the 3 rolled tacos with guac and shredded cheese on top. they come in a choice of chicken and beef. i ordered 2 beef and 1 chicken. overall, 3 rolled tacos doesn't get my mexican fix. the portions are small like taquitos. and the meat was fit to the roll, so i tasted meat in a total of 2 bites and the rest was the fried roll. as for the guacamole, it tasted unfresh and the consistency was wateryy. as for service, its whats expected from robertos."}
{"text":"Came here on my 30 minute lunch break with my coworker. We weren't greeted at all. A \"hello\" isn't that complicated. There was someone in front of us ordering though so I'll give him that. The young cashier with no name tag ignored us for 5 minutes after the previous person ordered then walked up to the register and practically whispered \"what can I get for you.\" It seriously took me a good minute to realize that he was talking to us. No eye contact no nothing. I got my carne fries with extra pico and extra sour cream and a churro. because let's face it, that's the best way to do it.   We waited for about 20 minutes (yup, I was late going back to work.) there was 3 other groups coming in after us. I see the cook with a ton of ready food in the background. He had about 8 orders ready to go. I waited a little bit longer then said, \"look man I'm on lunch at work and either need my food or a refund.\" He walked to the back without saying anything and bagged our food. Both of us had our food ready to go but he just didn't bother checking. Also keep in mind that most of the other people had their food ready (including the woman that was in front of us.)   The service was horrible. I understand that you're not working for much money but you'll never move up if you don't knock off that little attitude and actually show effort. When I got back to work, the fries weren't that hot anymore and the churro was soft and kind of sticky in the center. As someone who's worked in the food business multiple times before, let me just say that it's really not that dramatic. If you don't like your job, quit so someone who would  appreciates it can have it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at about 7 different Roberto's all over the valley and this one is by far the best on a consistent basis. I'm not sure what they put in their carne asada burritos here (probably crack, they are that good) but this location in particular has a different flavor than the others. Other menu items are good as well, but if you're going to this location do yourself a favor and get something with carne asada in it. As others have said... Don't bother phone ordering, just order when you get there to be sure you get exactly what you want. Bonus: open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Usually love robertos and know it's hit or miss on locations. Went in today and they were super busy. Even watched as a customer asked for ketchup for her kids fries and was ignored. Customer finally just sat down. Got my chicken tacos and went back to work only to find a hair in one of them. Lost my appetite !"}
{"text":"I get that this place is open 24hours, but that's no excuse for giving customers crappy food after hours. I order the  chicken taco and enchilada combination plate, instead I get tortillas filled with nothing but onions and bell peppers! I'm totally disappointed and for sure will never purchase from this establishment, ever! Keep my hard earned money, thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to taco shop in Las Vegas the food is constantly the same and you no what to expect"}
{"text":"food is decent but expensive for mexican, nothing special but ok, service is ok, not a bad place but not something to ever recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"The drive-through here's a little slow but it's convenient that they're open 24 hours. I work at an animal emergency hospital next-door. The staff is always friendly and nice but sometimes I see them taking their Mary time while making my food."}
{"text":"I went few days ago and I was not impressed I ordered a stake burrito and parts of the meat was cold it felt like they just got it from the refrigerator  it did not have a lot  of flavor and the portion was smaller then before the place was dirty the only nice thing I have to say is that the lady that helped us was very nice but the food was not very good."}
{"text":"Frickin' Awesome!!! I love their horchata and carne asada burrito. I especially love that this location supports the military and gives a discount!!! A+++++"}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm still NOT impressed....Last time, the carne asada fries were so bland, not to mention there was very little guac and the cheese was not melted. AND! !! This location doesn't have much variety (no Lengua Burritos!!!! :( )  I went in today and as always the cashier was not pleasant, not only did my food take forever to get to me, but my California Burrito just SUCKED. It seemed to be soaked in grease and salt, there was mostly meat in the frickin thing..hardly any \"fries, guacamole, & pico de gallo\" as they claim... and guess what? THE CHEESE WAS NOT MELTED, AGAIN! Ugh, I don't know how they cooked that meat...but it has left a bad taste in my mouth. I will never return to this location.  P.S. this location has a \"C\" Grade as far as food inspection."}
{"text":"the best breakfast burrito. they are always friendly and nice. Fast service. ALWAYS GOING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here cheese enchilada the cheese was not melted at all I brought it back they said that's how it's supposed to be don't play me stupid you idiots f****** Roberto's 0 stars for me I don't know why it has to dirty place also"}
{"text":"Perfection! I'm a San Diego native and I'm so thrilled that we have Roberto's here in Vegas! This particular Roberto's has great workers who will remember you and what your preferences are! Love, love, love the food!"}
{"text":"Just got off the phone with Abraham Rodriguez because of the order of rolled tacos that my husband brought home was covered with guacamole that was black/grey. The top layer was ok smothered with cheese but the bottom looked disgusting. Nice job trying to pass this off on a to go order even though the receipt was marked as \"dine-in\". He said I had to go back tonight to get a replacement order because their policy is they can only replace within five hours. I asked for the Name of the Manager and it is Malgro (sp??) I asked when he was in and was told he is in in the morning. I said that I would go in and speak to him directly. This is usually our go to on a Friday night for a quick bite. I would recommend you check your food before you leave the place to make sure it is ok. I don't understand how people can try and pass this off as edible. Guess it's time to go back to Jefe's Taco shop which is a little further away from my house but I've never been disappointed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"every time i go here the food is good but they always mess up one thing.  But it is small like, no Sour cream or add rice to my burritto.  So i have to wait for them to make it over again."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at this location 10/15/14. Ordered the same thing I ALWAYS get at Roberto's. Number 2 combo....no lettuce. Cashier girl took my order but never made eye contact the whole time. Acted weird. Then slides my card and receipt back to me without a word and just looks away. No \"here ya go\" or \"thank you\" or \"your order will be right up.\" They weren't very busy but order took probably 20 min to come out. They set it on the counter and....lettuce. Everywhere. I tell the girl, I'm sorry. I ordered no lettuce. She just stares. Then, after an awkward 30 seconds, she says...\"No, you just ordered #2, you never said no lettuce.\" No offer to fix it...nothing. She just waits for me to take my food. WORST SERVICE EVER."}
{"text":"We had Roberto's to go last night for dinner. I got a beef taco and a chicken taco. Easy enough.   Mike ordered a beef chimichanga with no cheese or sour cream. The guy read the order back to him and everything was good to go. Mike got home and there was cheese inside of it. He went back and showed them and it took him multiple times saying he ordered no cheese for them to understand what he was talking about. They ended up making him a new one and he came back home to join me.   This has probably been the 5th time that they have messed up an order. It's gotten to the point where I stand at the register like a crazy lady watching them make our food. Every time I catch them about to put cheese on something that shouldn't have it I yell, like a crazy lady.   I don't know where the miscommunication is or where people's orders get lost in translation since its printed out for them to stare right at. Every time I go there I want to go back less and less."}
{"text":"Ordered two adobado burritos to go.  Trying to support Trump owners.  Lousy burritos with grisly chopped meat, too many onions, and less than a 1/4 tsp of guacamole."}
{"text":"Went to Robertos last night at this location and ordered 7 of their .99 tacos.. paid $7 and some change. Looked like they wanted some tip and decided to charge my card for an even $8.. I don't mind it IF they had told me they were going to do that AND there was no tip line on the receipt. . Right now every penny counts ... that's the last time were going to that location. ."}
{"text":"gotta have my carne asada fries... with pickled jalapenos n carrots n green sauce"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was an off night but my 2 beef taco plate was subpar. The tacos were on the skinnier side than what I've had at other locations, the rice had chunks as if scraped from the bottom of the pot, and everything was super salty, more so than usual. Will try Faustos across the street next time for my Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"UGH! Two stars for a reason. Gross. On the daily I order my delicious #3 daily special (for you newbies is the cheeses quesadilla with beans and rice). But when I received my scrumptious meal it was how you say different then usual. When I took my first bite it was as if they melted spicy rubber and slapped it in a tortilla and decided it was good enough to sell to the public. Would recommend if you have a thing for spicy rubber. One word: disappointing especially for you Roberto's.    Update I am sorry for my brash review. I must understand that other people have feelings too and I do sincerely apologize to all staff at Roberto's taco shop. This is Judy speaking. Xoxoxoxox"}
{"text":"Its hard to give a 5 star to Robertos Taco shop, but I have to do it, its deserved, and its because of the concept and the food, its just done right with some thought and authenticity.   If I looked at any of the many locations, I would think, hole in the wall, due to the simple take out setup, but the food is better than some really fancy sit down spots.  I love the rolled tacos, the burritos, the hot sauce bar with carrots, peppers, green and red sauces, radishes, etc.  Its just perfect, I feel like I am in Tijuana every time...bravo!  5 star for food, 1 star for decor!   food wins!"}
{"text":"Always consistent and always good food. What more can you ask for? If you want gourmet go to a since Mexican restaurant and pay the price. This is really good here though for the price.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Another good machaca burrito!"}
{"text":"Not the best, but it does the trick.   I walk-in with sunglasses on, a hoodie pulled over my head, and a docile demeanor. Nope, I'm not trying to rob the place of money, just of it's delicious burritos and as many salsas as I can fit in my burrito bag.   Robertos is not the best Mexican food in Vegas. Hell, if might even be number twenty-two on my list of \"A-OK\" Mexican fast food places in the valley, but what this Robertos location does have that I love, as they say in real estate... location, location, location. I can pretty much walk here from my house. I came here after a raucous night at Yelp club night event that ended up going back to Henderson and resulted in me going to bed at 4am.   As I stare at the blurry menu, I zero-in on the Adobada Burrito. My main go-to when I need food meds to cure what ails me. If you haven't had Adobada Burrito it's basically chunks of slowly cooked pork in a red chile sauce, sometimes served with pineapples, and wrapped in tasty warm blanket of flattened bread, and paired with a guacamole/salsa mixture. This really is all you need, stop fussing about with rice and beans, pure filler! Stick with the basics, meat, veggies, and bread.   Anyone who doesn't think this place is fast food location is wrong. By the time I put in my order and walked over to the salsa counter, my burrito was already wrapped up and ready for consumption. That's pretty damn fast to me and under $6, sold.   BTW - The burrito was great and I took a nap immediately after. Food coma power down."}
{"text":"Robertos is a great stop at 3am for a taco or two.  I like to eat here when I'm too lazy to fry my own shells and shred meat for dinner."}
{"text":"Ever since I first tried their chimichanga here, I've been coming back so often to get it. I don't care much for the chicken inside, I really just like the wrap itself. This place is hit or miss with their customer service; the younger female cashier is really nice, the older one, not so much. Same with how the speed of how you get your food. I love getting the ham breakfast burrito as well, it's delicious."}
{"text":"You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back."}
{"text":"Clean and fast. The food was good and the order was correct. Better than most of them."}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shop Always friendly faces. Great food. Easy-going with brightly colored walls. You can't go wrong getting this kind of Mexican food. True spirit of Mexico. Mexican food is awesome."}
{"text":"There are many Roberto's in the valley, some better than others, some worse. But, in general the product is consistent and you're never too far away from one They provide good food at a reasonable price.  I used to go to this location before it was a Roberto's, it was a non-chain Mexican restaurant that had great chili rellenos, one of my favorites. I digress, back to the Roberto's Yelp.  I was working in the area and have been to this location several times, but had never Yelped them. I usually have the carne asada burrito, lunch special. For $7.35, you get a carne asada burrito, sides of rice and beans, with a drink. This is what I had today.  The burrito is filled with carne asada and avocado, very tasty, The sides of rice and beans, beans a little above average, rice average. Soda was the Pepsi genre.  I gave three stars, which is an average rating, which I consider them to be. But, I have Yelped many Mexican restaurants, as of late, many were so below average, I would seek out average. I like the food here, it tastes good, you get plenty, at a reasonable price, can't ask for much more than that. So if you're in the area, give them a try. If you're a Roberto's fan, this location is about average for them, I've been to better, been to worse, but in general the Roberto's are consistent, I recommend them."}
{"text":"Omg... To people are used to normal Roberto's ... This food tastes like dog food. I go outta my way to go to the Roberto's on rancho,  it's 5 miles further than my house,  but way better than dog food.   I could walk to this Roberto's ?  So close to my house,  but DO NOT want dog food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Always hits the spot. I recommend the chile relleno burrito and the nachos!! They never disappoint"}
{"text":"OK so being that I can cook really good Mexican food( or obtain it thru family) I am usually harsh when rating places like this. But when first walking in I was amazed by how clean it was. Also the staff was super super friendly like showing us the size of the tacos and quesadillas. I got the chicken taquitos and I have to say the freaking guacamole is amazing!!!! The rice and beans were very mediocre and lacked flavor. But my taquitos and hubby's asada tacos were pretty good. I also liked that they have orange soda. If grape soda would have been present I would have given this review 5 stars. All in all for a Robertos chain it was pretty good and Ill be coming back!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican dishes. Certainly more of a fast food quaintly rather than authentic.. Greasy but good if your in rush."}
{"text":"I must say that the carne asada fries and nachos are very addicting. I'm not a fan of their chicken tacos at all. This location is pretty hit or miss. The food can be anywhere from cold & old to hot & fresh."}
{"text":"This is not a good Mexican food. Wack. Over priced. The tacos have lots of meat but they are not good. Tortillas taste old. Burrito too much green peppers.:("}
{"text":"Love this location. They always put a good amount of meat on my carne asada fries and the fries are usually pretty crunchy. Their carne asada burritos are really good too. The service at the drive through is pretty fast compared to their other locations."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite location!! Not because it's the closest to my house but because they are the most clean and friendly! That goes an extremely long way when we are talking about eating out right? Well the portions at many robertos are always generous but usually get the California burrito or the Carne Asada burrito! Both are my favorite and you can never go wrong with either or!"}
{"text":"True authentic style Mexican food. I have tried almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the $1.00 chicken tacos. All the food is good; however, the service is always a little slow."}
{"text":"24 hour tacos? Yes please.  This place is a modest spot in the middle of a strip mall, seats about 2 dozen, and has a little self serve (I think? I hope?) mini buffet nook for peppers and veggies and whatnot.   The dude working here was nice enough, but the real point we care about is the food, huh?   I got the shredded beef burrito, which was tasty, but wet/soggy and not exactly overly flavorful. We also got the chicken chimichanga, which was huge, stuffed with a ton of chicken and cheese. Lastly was the shredded beef enchilada plate, which had a ton of onions, despite being told otherwise.   Overall, if you order a plate, the portions are huge. 3 stars because it's satisfying and a decent price, but not memorable."}
{"text":"Stop at Roberto's about 3 to 4 times a month.  Several reasons, Love Mexican food n this meal totally fits the bill. Very convenient to my home  and reasonably priced. Finally  golden spoon yogurt that's next door makes a great desert!"}
{"text":"Roberto's has been our go to for fried fish tacos and Mexican shrimp cocktail as well as various typical \"platos\" for decades. Fast, efficient, friendly service, super fresh and inexpensive. Don't miss the serve your self fresh salsa (green and red), marinated cucumber, radish and onions and fresh scallions. And don't be a cheap skate -- leave a tip for these wonderful people! Over twenty locations throughout the valley."}
{"text":"This location is good.  Clean and the staff is nice.  Much better than the location a mile away on Eastern.    Carne Asada Burrito and Enchiladas are my favorite items.  The rolled tacos are ok, but not great."}
{"text":"Being from California and having a resealable expectation that putting a fried egg in my breakfast burrito would be typical to some but not to the cashier. She was shocked and with a modest attitude she verified if they could do a fried egg !   I don't know, maybe it is unreasonable but the cook said yes, and was super polite and I thanked him. The cashier didn't seem to happy about but other wise not a bad spot just first impressions mean a lot !   My advice is to the cashier ! Settle down, just because you don't recognize something doesn't mean it's wrong of your unable to do it . Be polite and courteous! We only want to eat not rob you! We're paying for it after all !   Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Food is good!! The customer service is not. Very rude. No thank you no smile. Just a grumpy lady with an angry face handing you food. At least my food was good!"}
{"text":"I love the chimichangas here. Smoothered in guacamole and sour cream with rice and beans. It's def not the tex me you can find in good Ole tejas but for nevada it's not to bad for a quick fix. I def want to try some of the other items on the menu and the salsa bar is also fresh and a nice complament to the food."}
{"text":"I love the food, but styrofoam has got to GO! Bad for the environment!!! Please Stop!!!"}
{"text":"I AM DISGUSTED. This was the absolute worst Roberto's taco shop I have ever visited. Space I would rather eat McDonald's and eat at this location again, none of the food tasted fresh the employees were extremely rude and all that I got out of this was a stomachache and possibly food poisoning. I saw One of the employees was preparing food without gloves and touching his cell phone at the same time. I will never eat here again. One specific employee was so rude (tall with a mustache) he wouldn't even give me a water cup after I paid for my food."}
{"text":"I stop there every day for breakfast as it is open at 4AM and they dont mind I bring my bike in, which is cool. I have the breakfast burrito which is awesome."}
{"text":"Faustos is better in my opinion. The & $.47 unposted credit card charge is a rip off and just makes me want to take more salsa and condiments I'll never use. $1 taco Wednesday is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's.  We all know there's a bunch of locations in town but to me this one is the BEST.  First of all, it's always very clean.  Second, the food is always good.  Last but not least, the crew here is made up of some awesome people.  They are always so kind to me and my family.  We usually pick up food to go from here once a week.  Thank you Roberto's"}
{"text":"Gave this place another chance and see it hasn't CHANGED  a bit, no hello, no apologies for the wait time, NO NOTHING! Like no communication at all with customers. If your gonna take forever and a day on food, let me know so I can go inside and wait instead of wasting my GAS on yall. Just beyond crazy I gave this place another chance, then I look inside my bag it's been thrown at me, sloppy n all. I'm furious at this experience."}
{"text":"Super fast and amazing food after an all nighter. Great time had by all. The staff welcomes you and makes sure you're acknowledged and then gives you you're order in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Another Roberto's!  There's no difference to me between this location and the one on Blue Diamond, except for the fact that it has a little bit more seating.  Still a solid late night choice for food. Hell yeah."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burrito and it was so wonderful. I highly recommend this Roberto Taco Shop 1000% over the location on Lake Mead & Rancho in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"WORST FISH TACO'S EVER!! I had ordered fish tacos with extra white sauce.  The cashier said \"tartar sauce?\"  I replied, no, white sauce.  They use tartar sauce, and I was assured it was good.  My fish tacos came and were most definitely refried; meaning cooked previously (at least twice), as the breading was thicker, dark, and hard.  They also used lettuce, not cabbage, and the tartar sauce was nasty.   i should've gone to Rubio's, I know, but there wasn't one close and I was starving.  Now, I won't even go back for other food."}
{"text":"Best Roberto's I have been to. I'm extreamly happy this location is close by. I've had some dreadful food from other Roberto's locations but I knew I would eventually find a good one and this one is it. I always get the carne asada fries and they are delicious. The meat actually seasoned pretty good, unlike other Roberto's. I have also tried the taquitos and burritos all very delicious. Love the horchata and the fresh pepinos, relish and lemon they have set for the costumers. I am very very picky when it comes to Mexican food, I have certain expectations and they sure make the cut."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside Fabulous Freddy's, this Roberto's has some of the best customer service Roberto's has to offer. It doesn't hurt that you can play a little video poker while waiting for your chow. I was a little taken back by the \"B\" rating left by the Health Department. I guess that could pretty much be from anything, right? What am I complaining about, though. Back in school I would have given my left testicle for a \"B\". The food and the service is always good. So I will be back. B'a are fine. I just don't want to see any one legged A's."}
{"text":"They have drive thru !!!!! :)  Very nice place , its big and its clean . Friendly people and the food is great !"}
{"text":"Place is open 24 hours!  Carne Asada fries were great! The chorizo quesdilla were super greasy though...this place satisfies the late late night munchies."}
{"text":"Mixed Feelings. They prices are wonderful, and 80% of the time the unlimited cucumber/carrot bar is fresh. More specifically, I'd give 5 stars to the afternoon staff (on the ball, kind, quick), and 1 star to the evening crew, who refused to serve me the dish I always get in the afternoon, and mocked me for trying to order it.   I'll go there for lunch...but not dinner."}
{"text":"If you want fast food Mexican, go to Taco Bell. The food is good but I can't give them 5 stars. EVERY time I order they mess something up. If you order from the menu no problem but if you want something take off like tomatoes they will still be on there."}
{"text":"There is a guy who works here that has the worst customer service I've ever seen! He has negative energy, he always looks down, he always seems frustrated and that he doesn't want to be there. I used my card to pay for the meal I had there and when I had gotten the piece of paper to sign, I made a joke and said \"Keep that, it'll be worth $1 million in 20 years\". Trying to see if I could get him to smile or laugh, all I got was \"I doubt it\". I have dealt with this guy twice, and both times he has been absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Roberto's for about 3 years now and I haven't been disappointed once. I usually order a regular bean and cheese burrito or the Carne Asada Nachos but everything I've tried is still good!"}
{"text":"This location always runs out of chicken tacos which really makes me question how they make them. Like how does a Mexican restaurant run out of tortillas and chicken?? Whoever restocks this location needs to get it together."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY horrible. I usually eat here and the food is always wonderful. However, the customer service there is horrific. I came in and ordered a number 7 (enchiladas) and number 4 (two tacos), both of which I paid for. After coming back to pick up my meal I left the store with my meal before checking, after looking at it two minutes later I found that the order was wrong and went back to the store. I told the girl, who ended up being the manager (Angela), that the order was wrong. I told her what I originally ordered and that's when she started to get attitude, like it was my fault she got the order wrong. She than proceeded to ring me up for the tacos. I told her I was not going to pay for them since I had already paid for two meals, of which I over paid for apparently. She than told me she could not let me walk out with another meal without paying for it, and she couldn't take the other meal because I left. I told her I paid for my meal already, I just wanted her to fix her mistake. She continued to get attitude and told me I had to pay for it. I than asked where her manager was, she smiled and said actually I'm the manager. I said this is ridiculous that she wouldn't help me, and it was her mistake. I told her she had horrible customer service and she started to laugh and said \"sorry miss\". I asked her who her store manager was and she laughed again and said he's not in. I said I wanted his name and I was going to tell her store manager about her. She just said that's fine and started to write down the store number and her name while laughing. She also started speaking Spanish to her colleagues, of which I understood, her thinking I didn't. She is absolutely a horrible representative for the company and makes a bad name for them and herself. She made a fool of not only me in front of other customers, she made a fool of herself. She should not be working in any food places until she learns what good customer service is and how to go that extra mile for the company. I speak from experience because I am also a manager that works with people all day. I work with customers all day. If I make a mistake I don't make the customer pay for it. I will not say what the company should do with her, but something should be done about her behavior and the way she acts with customer."}
{"text":"This Robertos has consistently good food. Sometimes the sidebar is not fully stocked. Convenient location makes it our most frequented Robertos in town."}
{"text":"The employee working the counter was rude, wasn't helpful and when asked for military discount informed us it was too late.  Ask upfront your service isn't appreciated enough to reciprocate after you ask what you want."}
{"text":"Wow the chorizo plate is awesome. This place is beautiful and smells clean. I love this Robertos. Numeral #1"}
{"text":"Pissed I went through the drive through and ordered my chicken and rice tostada with double rice no beans and they charged me an extra $1.00 for a Jamica drink instead of a Pepsi no other Roberto's does that. I get to work and there's rice and beans. WTH she even repeated it back to me. Now I'll stick to the Roberto's I go to. Ugh this sucks. I even called and the girl was like I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Fast service! The chicken soft tocos are so big and good. How much you get the price is unbelievable! You won't believe it until to try it. One of my new favorite spots for sure!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Robertos, you must live on mars!  lol  Yes, I love this place, I love there Taquitos....Thats what we use to call them back in the day, but they call them rolled tacos!  What ever!  I love them!  Robertos have stepped up there game as well, with there beans, these beans are off the chain, they have so much flavor!    Ok....Sooooooo We were getting ready to order...you know how you go over to there veggie bar, and get your onions and peppers?  Ok, check this out, this family's order came up,and they had a plate of grilled green onions and peppers!  Did ya'll hear me!  I had to ask, where is that on the menu, and what is it called!  She said something in spanish, I can't tell ya'll what she said!  I did understand that she said it was free! SAY WHAT!  OMG,  I wanted that asap! I wanted to sink my teeth into that pepper in the car, but I held back until I got home!  If you love Robertos, get the grilled green onions and peppers!"}
{"text":"Not much for real or good Mexican Food in this neighborhood.  Roberto's may be good if you fighting a hangover or desperate for some Mexican.  But if I had to choose I will take Del Taco, Taco Bell or Drive across town for some authentic.  The restaurant are always clean - so here's an extra star"}
{"text":"Every Wednesday night during my lunch break I stop by this location for their 99 cent chicken taco special. For less than 4 bucks I get very filling, greasy, and delicious tacos in my belly before I have to go back and toil away at my miserable job. Its the only thing I look forward to every Wednesday night. Haha."}
{"text":"The guy who was working when we went in was sooo nice and funny!  He gave me some Spanish lessons and joked with us.  The place is spacious and very clean.  Our food was awesome with huge portions.    This is the best Roberto's I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Exactly how do you confuse Chicken Chimichanga & French Fries with Carne Asada Burrito & Enchilada Combo Plate?  IDIOTS!"}
{"text":"I love the food... however, every time we order our food to go the order is wrong... EVERY time.  Even three ingredients, how do you mess that up?  I am defeated... I can no longer be tempted by the thought of enjoying one of Roberto's greasy burritos in the comfort of my own home...  Always a disappointment."}
{"text":"Simply put, after stopping here once, I've never stepped into a Chipotle again. Authentic Mexican food, incredibly delicious, and all at amazingly affordable prices.   The carne asada burrito is a home run every single time. It comes standard with guac and pico de gallo, but I usually add rice/refried beans, cheese, and sour cream, and still pay less than for what I'd pay for a burrito at Chipotle.   You know what the best part about Roberto's is? THEY'RE OPEN 24 HOURS!!! So if you're coming home late from Tao or XS or whatever may have you, this is the place to stop in to satisfy those late night cravings.   Great food, great prices, great staff!!!"}
{"text":"I just can't handle a place that charges extra for sour cream and guacamole. It breaks my heart! Especially when it's for carne Asada fries or a carne Asada burrito.   I've been here twice but those were late night munchie runs when I didn't want to drive to far locations.   Service is quick and the food is good.. But not that good. Their hot carrots are crunchy too and not spicy what so ever, but their green salsa is delicious and always hits the spot.   Id recommend you come to this location if you're in the area and not wanting to drive far."}
{"text":"Im only giving this place 2 stars and that's because the young girl that is the cashier is not friendly at all. She is just rude! I guess maybe if it's family owed she doesn't feel the need to be customer friendly."}
{"text":"Ah Robertos. Your location is of no relevance, Eastern, Bermuda, or anywhere else for that matter I can always trust you to give me the bubble guts. I think I'll leave it at that.   Oh thanks for the free limes for my Coronas tho."}
{"text":"Carne asada is very disappointing, poor quality with a ton of salt to give it flavor. Im from So Cal, we have amazing Mexican food especially quick shops like this. I feel like they should care more about their meat quality.  Their hot salsa (red) has zero flavor.   The place is really dirty, I can't imagine its clean in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite taco shop in my area. Until I found a piece of latex glove in my taco. I haven't been able to return. Glad they wear gloves though."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the family and got dinner to go. Wife got a #7 Carne Asada combo and I got the #4 shredded beef tacos. While we were eating, wife found a plastic disk in her beans, and an old, nasty french fry in her guacamole. There was not a piece of meat that wasn't gristle, so we threw most of hers away. Mine, on the other hand was just bland and tasteless, or so I thought. I spent the night wanting to throw it all back up as it sat like a festering rock in the pit of my stomach. Do yourself a favor, go to the Chipotle down the road; it may not be \"authentic\" but at least it is edible."}
{"text":"I usually stop here from time to time, hoping that the food has gotten better.. but it still hasn't.  Roberto's used to be my go to late night eats b/c it's right down the street from my house and the price wasn't too bad for a huevos rancheros plate.  But, the quality has dipped a bit a couple of months ago but, somehow, I keep coming back hoping that maybe they would magically improve like in the beginning.  But, it's the same everytime.  The only thing I like about this Roberto's is that they usually get my order right and the workers are nice, but it still pushing me over to Rivas for some better eat and the refillable fountain drink machine."}
{"text":"Wow. The location is filthy dirty and I got chicken tacos to go before I saw the gross dirt everywhere and they are the worst chicken tacos from Robertos ever. Don't eat here. This is a rare review from me"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, open 24 hours.  What else could I want?   I love the carne asada nachos and $1.30 tacos on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs!!!!  Best chili rellenos, chorizo tacos, & cheese enchiladas, are our favorites!  Cooked fresh so it might take a while. We like to order by phone and take it home. Wish they'd deliver. Always crowded, but we've found after 8p is ok as is 3-4p."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Robertos to go to. I've been coming here for years it's not a bad location and the bullet proof glass shouldn't scare you. They are friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"For a taco shop they are consistently good and always have something that sounds good.  The tacos are good, the plates are good. The only thing I don't like is the breakfast burritos, just too much tortilla."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is non existent. I went there yesterday, ordered my food over the phone, when I got there the young woman in the front didn't say anything when I said 'I ordered for pickup ' so I told her what I ordered and she walked to where the carryout was without saying a word to me still. I asked her a question and she simply nodded her head yes. Still hasnt said anything to me. Finally she says '$12.77' I hand her my card, when she handed it back to me I said thank you and she still said nothing and walked away. Not only did the service lack, the condiments area was extremely dirty. There was not any green sauce so I politely asked for some and once again she just walked away without saying anything and got the sauce. If you are wondering, she spoke perfect English. The food was okay, not worth it though. I would rather go 15 minutes out of my way to go to a different Roberto's location."}
{"text":"That 4am cashier dude who looks like mario is rude as hell. He got my order wrong and heard him tell his friend \"cabron\" which im pretty sure was referring to me. The food is good but service is bad. Wont come back. Dont go here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Best Mexican food we have had in Vegas!!!! The service is fast and large portions!!!!"}
{"text":"Who the hell doesnt let you alter the menu?   I wanted a sausage and bacon breakfast burrito, the same thing I get at the other 2856 locations in this town. I go to order my burrito and was told I can't make any changes to the menu. Our exchange went something like this:   Me: Can I have a breakfast burrito with sausage and bacon?  Him: I can't do that.  Me: do you have sausage?  Him: Yes Me: Ok so give me a bacon breakfast burrito and add sausage. Him: I can't do that, I can only give  you what's on the menu with no changes?  Me: wtf?    This is the craziest thing I have ever heard. I have never been to any restaurant in any part of the world that you weren't able to order an item and make preference changes to it."}
{"text":"As good as it gets, my favorite Mexican fast food place. They seem to be everywhere and open all the time, so its a solid spot to go to in the middle of the night. The Carne Asada is seasoned and marinated to perfection, and the breakfast burritos are great!"}
{"text":"I'm from Ocean Beach in San Diego, where the original Roberto's is. The food is fast and easy and the staff is very friendly. I usually get the carnitas or the tacos. The tortillas are yummy- which any person is from SD knows that is important ! It's my go to for Mexico's in Northern Vegas."}
{"text":"This picture speaks for itself. I ordered chicken fries and this is what I got. I have never ordered food from Roberto's and been this dissatisfied. The food was nasty looking, nasty tasting! The money I spent went straight Into the trash! Never again would I ever go to this Roberto's or any other Roberto's!"}
{"text":"I only like the Rolled Tacos and I'm pissed because my husband went to buy some for me and walked out because they charged extra for Lettuce! Really Roberto's Really!? Now he won't eat there anymore because that...Sorry Roberto's you had a forever customer in me until you did that today. ?"}
{"text":"The absolute best robertos in Vegas been to many and for some reason this location has th we freshest ingredients and good service..."}
{"text":"This specific Roberto's is very clean, never busy, and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend coming to this specific Roberto's if you live around the area. They will actually take their time and make sure you have delicious Mexican food. They're open 24 hours a day at this location which is really nice. On Wednesdays, they have .99 cent chicken tacos. (Hard shell taco with shredded chicken, cheese, and lettuce for only .99 cents)  In my opinion, this is the best Roberto's Taco Shop location in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's in general, but this particular location is FABULOUS. The staff is friendly and helpful with good attitudes. The eating area is huge and there are tables outside as well. But the best thing is the speed. They are ridiculously fast with getting out the orders. I eat here all the time and my orders have always been perfect with no mistakes. If you are in the area and you like Roberto's, this is definitely the location to go to."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, these shops are only south Orange County/ San Diego, Ca & Vegas! There was one in Riverside, Ca. But like most great things it woke up one day realizing it was in Riverside, Ca & then got the F--- out! L.A. Has Alberto's & Alvarro's etc.. (Their font and signage is nearly identical) but once you try Roberto's it's clear their ingredients are FAR superior than the other Taco chain(s)! I used to say Alberto's had the best drunk food, but after trying Roberto's, I can't even stoop to the Alberto's level anymore...  Rolled Chicken tacos Chicken Burrito Chicken Chimichanga!"}
{"text":"Bleh! I had a Chile relleno & cheese enchilada combo and I was disappointed from first bite to last. The enchilada sauce was extremely salty, the enchilada tortilla was tough to cut as was the Ortega chile used for the Chile relleno, which was also filled with seeds. The beans were thick & pasty. I want my money back."}
{"text":"The food was great! We were highly impressed! Just moved to vegas from California and its hard to find good mexican food out here. Im only giving  two stars because my family and I all had upset stomachs and had to run home to immediately use the restroom (very urgent situations). Very disappointing considering the taste was great! Also had to pay $1.19 for for a small scoop of pico de gallo (rip off)"}
{"text":"This is the best Roberto's I've ever been to! I wouldn't recommend any other location I've been to except this one. A bonus that you get to watch them make the food through a little window in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"This is an OUTSTANDING ROBERTOS!!! The staffs are Very Quick and The guy cashier name Abraham has a nice quick flow on taking customers orders when this place is packed. I also been coming to this one for years already. I don't know why these people complain about there food missing something just go back and they can remake you're order or you can get your money back. No other restaurant will give you a Return policy 5 star RATING."}
{"text":"Stopped into Robertos for the first time the other week after a binge study session at the Starbucks next door. I have heard mixed reviews about the franchise and decided to just find out for myself.   I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I just got an order of carne asada fries to go and ate them outside and enjoyed the weather while people watching. The carne asade was a little too salty for my tastes and the fixings with the fries were alright. I think the saltiness of the meat threw it off for me. Way too salty.   The portions were great though. It was huge and I had enough for a whole other meal the next day. Granted it wasn't as good the next day since the fries were a tad soggy but hey a meal is a meal sometimes.   Honestly, I'm not sure if I would come back to any of the chain locations. Maybe out of convenience if I'm ever near one and I'm craving some Mexican food.   There is also an ample amount of parking at this location so that's always nice too!"}
{"text":"Horrible plain and simple I have to drive to the anthem location because this one is too painful to endure"}
{"text":"I got two words for ya: shrimp burrito!!!! Try to get it with some red sauce for an extra kick."}
{"text":"My husband ordered Shredded beef nachos with no guacamole, a chicken soft taco, and a #2 . However, we got nachos with JUST CHEESE AND GUACAMOLE, a CARNITAS soft taco and a #2. He didn't realize until he got home and when I checked the receipt, it was entered correctly yet they still got it wrong. This is the 2nd time this has happened and I'm done. Lost my business!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why they changed there fish tacos. They used to be so good! Just went there for dinner and the fish tacos I got were awful!!! They need to go back to the way we're! Has anyone out there noticed the change or is it just me?"}
{"text":"Order takeout my hole meal was cold except for the beans how is that possible... The meat taste like it was in the fridge and the rice was dry and also felt like it came out the fridge... Not to mention the stale tortillas smh never again never again will I eat at this place"}
{"text":"The food here is usually good but the service is terrible. I waited 30 minutes today for a simple burrito because the staff didn't put my order in. I explained (politely) that I had to get to work and would just like my money back. They refused and kept telling me that it was coming any minute. When it finally showed up in the middle of my last request for a refund the girl said \"Whatever.\" I through the food in the trash and went somewhere else - I will never come here again and advise anyone in a hurry to reconsider this place. If you have 30 minutes to wait and don't mind the rude staff go for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ran to this Roberto's last night/early this morning (9/3/17) around 1:30am. We live within walking distance. He asked if I wanted anything and it's lucky for me that I said no. He ordered two beef tacos and it had the usual beans and rice with it.   Around 4:30am he started barfing and shitting. He's been terribly sick ever since. I'd suggest not eating here."}
{"text":"I've been to Roberto ' s twice . beef chimichangas are pretty good. packed with peppers and onions for In  your face flavor. only complaint is that the platters do not come with enough rice & beans. Also, the chimichangas are kinda soggy . but that's probably because they cover them with sour cream & guacamole.  I'll have to remember to request them putting it on the side."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 carne asada burritos. One of them with no pico de gallo and both of them with rice and beans(not included). The young man at the cash register read back the order to me and everything was correct. When i got the receipt I told him it was incorrect, it said no beans on one burrito only and no rice. I asked him about it before the food was made and he said that it was correct the way to their understanding so i said okay. I get the food and I go home. One burrito is double the size of the other, we open both burritos and they are what it says on the receipt (which is wrong) I called them and spoke to the same young man and he was nothing but rude with me and he said i need to drive back so they can fix it and that I can't get a refund until they see the burritos. I agree with that but it's just upsetting when i tried to make sure the order was correct from the start. Won't be going back, we decided to not return it because god knows what they would do to the new order. And to top it off the food wasn't that great either!"}
{"text":"**************Updated review******************  So my previous review was kinda harsh and I have actually come to enjoy Roberto's! Love the little condiment bar they have. Fresh limes, jalapeños, salsa, and green onion! Their breakfast burritos are good as well as their asada fries. The only downside is its not very greasy (lol). It's fast, easy, and really hits the spot sometimes! Love that it's cheap too!"}
{"text":"I have tried several time to like Robertos and it literally does nothing for me.  I give 3 stars for the employees, everyone is always nice and personable but the food just doesn't tickle my fancy. I love mexican food but the taste just doesn't agree with my tongue... idk all i know is ive decided I wont be back!"}
{"text":"Summary: A roller coaster ride of review updates for this Robertos Taco location.   I am not sure why it has to be this way, but it is (this way). This place is as consistent as I am religious in keeping to \"clean\" language in reviews (which is to say not at fucking all).   You get a public service discount one day, you don't the next.  You get a drink with your combo (they are listed as coming with one, and certainly implied in the term), and you don't.   I'm wondering if they are as A or B with their hand-washing back there. (Every one working with food should be A-type personalities when it comes to sanitation.)  One year they are two stars; incrementally they make a fan out of a skeptic; then, they manage to fuck it all up again.   The breakfast burritos are the shittiest I have purchased at any other location on planet Earth. Pro Tip: Don't buy them. Just get a lunch/dinner burrito really fucking early. Your stomach will suffer one way or another at 4 a.m..  I wish I never met you, Robertos. I wish I could Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind you. Damn you."}
{"text":"Avoid this shop at all costs!  The food was fine, but they were totally dishonest.   We paid for our meal with a Visa, and when we checked our account, we were overcharged.  I had signed the receipt and added a tip, however the worker must have gone back and added more of a tip!  When I called to let the manager know what happened, I got nothing but attitude from her.  She told me that they don't keep any records of sales, and couldn't do anything.  Pay with CASH!"}
{"text":"Ordered plain carne asada fries. The cost went up but my complaint isn't about that. When I got home and saw what they gave me, the order didn't even fill half the container (this is just the meat, cheese, and fries). The fries were soggy and undercooked. They didn't use the wax paper so the container had melted under the fries due to the grease. Store manager refused to provide refund even though I had a picture of the subpar food and receipt. (Sorry I don't need my car smelling like crap so I can show you your employees can't make.a simple order)  Update: spoke with owner and notified him of the subpar experience and my inability to go back the same night due to my thyroid cancer recovery. Still refused to provide any type of refund and definitely didn't care if he would lose customers over this terrible experience. Won't be going to any robertos ever again."}
{"text":"I am sorry but this place gives you way too much food and I don't like the vibe of the restaurant. The employee didn't speak English and didn't know what to say to me. I tried my best to make him understand but I totally got the wrong food. I did not care but he was annoyed I wasn't eating it. He gave me a dirty look and I was very annoyed as well. I don't think I will be going back......"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location many times and have never had an issue until today.  We picked up take out and brought it home.  I ordered a burrito with only potatoes, cheese and sour cream. Half way through the burrito, I bit into something hard, pulled it out of my mouth and found a large pebble in between the potatoes and cheese.    I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the owner.  I spoke to someone who said they were the owner and she offered me a free burrito or my money back.  There was no apology at all. She acted as if they only got the order wrong. I don't need my money back.  I wanted to know why they have rocks in their food! Do they drop things on the ground or do they store ingredients under the sink in open containers?  How would a rock get in their food?  She didn't care at all, so I just filed a complaint with the health district instead."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time.  It's a great standby for some good Mexican.  Ultra affordable and has more character than going to Taco Bell.  The carne asada and the adobado could be served on a shoe and it'd be delectable.  24 hour place, therefore great for an early morning breakfast burrito.  And it's right next to a pink box donuts (though not 24 hour like their parent store) so everybody's got a chance for a great local two-fer."}
{"text":"Food is great here but customer service isn't as great though. Unfortunately the young girl in the front doesn't greet and came off a bit rude. There is a sign up right by their register to ask for a receipt upon receiving your food. When I did, she told me that their store doesn't give out receipts but gave me one that came from the cooks. I've worked with food last year and customer service is a priority. She may have had a bad morning or something but I felt that I wasn't welcomed to stay here."}
{"text":"Food here is terrible. Quality of meat is awful. Better off going to Taco Bell. They don't have ground beef or anything with white meat chicken either."}
{"text":"3 chicken rolled tacos for only $2.25 with no guacamole. hands down the best 24 hrs taco shop to go to. Love begging my friends to take me after a long night of clubbing. You can also pick up a Las vegas weekly for free at every location. The magazine is a local thing and its a Great way to see whats going happening in almost everywhere in vegas"}
{"text":"Desperate.  Hungry.  Impatient.  I want it now!  That's what happened when we were right in the middle ground of two different Roberto's Taco Shops in our area.  We ended up going to the one slightly closer to us for an afternoon snack.  The Roberto's that is located literally in a hole-in-the-wall...in Fabulous Freddy's Car Wash.  Not really used to this, being our first time here we made our way in.  Everything about this Roberto's is like the others around town, menus all look the same, kitchen all smells the same.  Thankfully!  We had a need...the need for....carne asada!  Sorry all you Top Gun lovers out there.  Ended up ordering one of my usual suspects from Roberto's, the Carne Asada Burrito ($5.65).  This bad boy has no frills - just meat, guac, and salsa.  On a fresh tortilla.  No cheese.  No sour cream.  But damn is it tasty!  Still one of the better burritos I've had!    Service was fast, order was even faster since we were like the only ones there that day.  A couple of things knocked this Roberto's down a star.  Ambiance.  So strange, who likes eating Mexican in the middle of a non-Mexican car wash station?  I literally sat on a tiny table next to the snack racks on one side, and the beer coolers on the other.  Need a Twinkie?  I could have reached out and grabbed one as dessert.  Other gripe is that this Roberto's has NO condiment/salsa bar like all the other ones do.  I like buffet options dammit!  I like making my own little plates of cucumbers, radishes, pickled carrots & jalapenos.  Plus I like copious amounts of red & green salsa for my meal.  None of this available at the Roberto's in the car wash station.  But they do have all of these items for you, just ask the cashier behind the Roberto's counter and they will give you little baggies & containers of veggies and salsa.    Roberto's luckily your Carne Asada Burrito is just as good as the ones I've had before in other locations.  Meaty, fatty, rich, carb & calorie loaded, with a touch of fresh.  Just the way it should be!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, Roberto's is my go-to when I want me some fast Mexican food...and don't wanna deal with those huge 'Mexican' chains!  Yeah, that's you DEL & BELL...  This one is probably closest one to home.  Often pretty busy too.  We usually eat in the restaurant because of what else...the FREE salsa bar!  Thing is loaded with all the sides you need for your meal - pickled carrots, sliced cucumbers, sliced radishes, jalapenos, limes, heck..even stalks of fresh green onion!  Their red & green salsas are good as well.  Stock up!  What the fam & I usually order doesn't change much when we visit any Roberto's.  We'll stick with the popular carne asada burrito or the machaca burrito (I do like breakfast for dinner), the rolled tacos or carne asada nachos or chicken tacos (don't forget their $1 chicken taco Wednesdays), and I feel like a change one of their tortas.  But no matter what we get it's a decent quick meal.  Watch out though...the fillings in the burritos can be DAMN HOT!  They literally cook it, place it in a warm tortilla, then send it out.  Tasty, tasty, but watch your mouth!  Enough to cause some heat backlash.  Be dainty like me if you have to...cut the burrito in half to let out some of that steam!  Their red & green salsas accompany their food very well.  I can't really decide which one I like better so I always douse my food with some of both.  Delegation, y'all!  Their carne asada nachos are actually quite HUGE, they really give more meat than chips in this one.  And they pile on the cheese...not to mention the sour cream & guac!  Like a massive spoonful of each.  Fatty city, here I come!  But really, they taste good enough I just don't care.  I'll just eat a side of some of Roberto's raw veggies from the salsa bar to even it out a bit.    Don't start on those rolled tacos.  They are no doubt fatty, fat cholesterol bombs!  KABOOM!  Rolled tacos, covered, and I mean COVERED in shredded cheddar cheese & topped of with generous amounts of sour cream & guac.  Get yourself a defibrillator if you're eating an order of these along with a burrito or nachos.  Oily goodness!  Oh yeah get extra napkins too.  Folks are nice enough there and never give me any trouble.  Fast & efficient service.  Es muy bueno!"}
{"text":"I love this robertos its best in town they give you ample amounts in steak on there carne asada fries youll never be disapointed going here."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the cashier was so rude and disrespectful. I have a pretty high tolerance for people but she had 100% no manners. I asked her nicely to get extra pico on my nachos and apparently that was an issue for her. No tip for you! I don't feel bad that you make minimum wage."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance food is edible, service is awful. Don't expect friendly service."}
{"text":"Haters gonna hate! I had read the bad reviews and usually stay away from Mexican chain restaurants but gave this place a try and was happily surprised.  On weekends if you're looking for decent (and greasy) menudo - is there any other way- hit this place up. Any day, their tortas are delicious, and their tacos are good but overpriced $3.25?!  They do use regular size tortilla and not taco tortilla, but you be the judge.   I'm taking a star away is because their tortillas are not fresh, so I have to make my own."}
{"text":"This is pretty average mexican food. The service was quick and the people working there were nice. The guacamole has no taste. It was the worst I've ever had. The burrito I got was ok. The portions are big. I don't think I'll be back as there must be better mexican food shops out there that are better."}
{"text":"Loveeeeee my Roberto's !!! Awesome people and delicious food! Carne asada fries, cheese quesadilla, beef tacos!!! Sooo yummy love this place !"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Robertos. The food is always hot and fresh and served quickly. They accommodate my veggie requests without hesitation, and I'm never disappointing when we visit. The restaurant maintains cleanliness more so than other Robertos I have been in, which is very nice.   Note, to all my veggie loving friends they will make Carne Asada fries sans the carne, and they are delicious! #veggie4life"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for awhile now, so I finally get I and place my orders. Chips were piping hot but lacked a good hot sauce to dip them into, Beef tacos were good just not as good as a taco truck as had been told, rice. An beans, just soso. Was happy for jalapeños and carrots just wished the whole meal were a little more spicy"}
{"text":"Never been to a robertos before I actually liked the rice and beans. I had the rolled tacos aka flautas lol with chicken. Chicken was good with both mine and one taco my husband had. The downfall was the beef had no flavor  other then that good food"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, plentiful portions, very. affordable and served quickly with a smile.  This was our first time in to this location and we were very pleased.    The restaurant was clean.  Comfortable seating, easy to read menu.  I ordered the Carnitas plate that came with two enormous tortillas,and I also ordered a beef tamale. My wife ordered a fish taco and a chicken tamale. The food and sauces were delicious like what I grew up with.  Excellent value.    I would have liked access to pico de gallo and more flavorful salsa on the bar that offered serve-yourself salsa, hot peppers, carrots, scallions and cucumbers.  In summary, this is our new favorite Mexican food joint!!! Food is very good, the portions are big, prices are very reasonable and the people inside are friendly.  If you like Mexican (not Tex-Mex) food, stop in and give them a try.  You'll like it!"}
{"text":"There are two reasons I decided to give a one star review. The first is more of an annoyance. The second is the reason I will NEVER return...  Today I got some carne asada nachos. I've gotten these from plenty of robertos locations in the past, it's one of my favorite things on the menu.   The first reasoning I gave a low review for this location is that they don't have the \"bar\" where you get carrots, salsa, cucumbers and more. Instead you must ask for them from behind the counter and they'll give you a small bag. We ordered multiple meals for multiple people, asking for carrots and salsa and they give one bag. Even though we asked for a particular number. They're very stingy when it comes to giving salsa, carrots and everything else. I would understand only giving one of each if I got one small meal, but when I buy a lot of food, I don't understand why I'm still only allowed to get one bag of carrots. The more items I buy should allow me a bigger helping of these things. Example: I should get a minimum 1 bag for each meal I pay for. Honestly I could see past this, it's really not a great reason to give a one star review for but it is one thing that annoys me and others about this location.  And now time for the biggest reason I gave them one star.   The reason I'm giving only one star is because what I found IN my food. I found a BUNCH of chopped up rubber bands. (The ones that usually hold bunches of cilantro together) at first I just thought some parts of the meat were chewy, until I looked harder at my food and I'm glad I noticed, the rubber bands are green so they blend in pretty well. My stomach is starting to majorly ache, I really hope I don't get sick from this. I understand mistakes happen but this sounds more like someone was just being lazy! I will not be returning to this location. Truth be told, I might not eat Robertos at any location again. Thankfully I found a better tasting taco shop, way cleaner and great pricing. And their food is even better at curing hang overs. LOL.  Sorry Robertos, we had a good run. Goodbye!"}
{"text":"Coming from Texas where we have glorious, amazing gas station tacos, I was a bit underwhelmed. It probably had something to do with the fact that the tacos were covered by guac and pico, two things I generally don't put on a taco. A true gas station taco - as prescriped by www.gasstationtacos.com - should be meat, corn tortilla, onions, cilantro and possibly some crazy hot salsa. These seemed much more California, trying to be fancy.   The pork torta was good, short of the massive amount of fat and connective tissue I got halfway through. Other than that, solid choice."}
{"text":"This place is usually great but after today I will not come back. We went through the drive through and we had no one acknowledge that we where there. After serval minutes we finally asked for someone attention. The lady then asked us for our order and the say hold on. Once again we were waiting the we said hello because she didnt day anything . She continued to say wait hold on. Then she finally says it's going to be about 5-7 minutes before she could take our order. So we waited about 20 more minutes and then drove to the window. We continued to wait at the window for about 5 more minutes while the lady at the register was counting change. A different lady the opened the drive thru window and let us know that their system went down. When she asked us if we would like to wait the lady that was  counting changes then jumps in and says \"you need to change your face it's the systems fault\""}
{"text":"I do love me some Roberto's food! No, it isn't fancy or good for you in the least, but I do enjoy it from time to time.  I just wish I could talk my hubby into eating here more often.  Here's why I like Roberto's:  1. Huge portions!  I rarely can finish any meal that I order from here.  I almost always have leftovers that are great the next day.    2. Good and cheap! My wallet is never crying after I pay for food here. You get a ton for what you pay for.  I love a good deal.  3. Super fast! It is totally fast food! This is great because I am usually in a rush.  I do think they should add a drive thru window though.  I rarely go, because I usually have a crazy 2 year old in the backseat and getting her in and out of her car seat is too much work most of the time.  4. It's open 24 hours!   Why only 3 stars? Well...  1. The staff isn't particularly friendly.  They aren't mean or rude, but they aren't very welcoming either.  2. I do like it, but I don't make a huge effort to go there, which means it is just ok in my book.  I know that is totally subjective, but it is the truth.   So I do enjoy Roberto's and everyone should try it at least once.  And if you do, try the Carne Asada fries!"}
{"text":"This is really just okay. Like, not terrible, but not great. I've been a couple times and both times I was like \"mehhhhh \"... I lived in Mexico for 3 years, so I feel like I kinda know my stuff. Mind you northern Mexican food differs from southern Mexican food, I think they are trying to do a northern Tex-Mex thing.  If you're looking for an enchilada or something real basic, then this'll do it for you.  The inside could be cleaned up a little, too. The tables are left uncleaned for the whole time I was there, I had to wipe away refried beans off my seat.  The ladies behind the counter were nice though.  *** the help yourself salsa/pickled veggies buffet is pretty foul, a lady took out her dentures, left them on her napkin on the side of the buffet and grabbed some pickled veggies. Grooooooss."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to write a bad review,  I have raved about the French fries here and have hooked a lot of people on their fries. I had hoped it was just a fluke that I was getting undercooked fries, but 4 times in a row isn't a fluke. I use to come on every Tuesday for these fries, but I can't continue to be disappointed and eat soggy undercooked fries. I think this will be my last time getting fries here. It's a sad day."}
{"text":"20 minutes for two  chicken tacos. And two orders came in after me got their food first. Under new management... Right..."}
{"text":"Food is average. Customer service is horrible they never smile even when you smile at them. The negative attitude she has is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The worst place to go eat. Messes up your order and says \"I repeated your order\" when clearly if he did, we wouldn't have had this problem. We ordered two number 14 and three number 12, later when we got home, I only see that I have gotten one number 14 and one number 12, got really upset so went back, I have explained to him that he got the order wrong and told him what I should have gotten. He tells me \"oh. You got two number 14 and one number 12, here look I have proof in my register\". He prints out the receipt, and it says two number 14 and three number 12. Things got really complicated and heated. I told him that what we got wasn't correct. He kept insisting that I only asked for one number 12.  Than later he told us that we were \"you were laughing and giggling too much so I miss interpreted\". I'm sorry, I didn't know ordering food can be so funny. Maybe if he turns down his music he could hear better.If I can give this place a zero star lol  Here's a little tip: CUSTOMERS are always right and you are wrong, I've worked in a good place and every place goes by that \"motto\""}
{"text":"This place is great food and u have to wait a little longer than some other places but its worth the few extra mins.. The breakfast burritos r so yummy. If u have never been to a location just once hive it a try. U will like it, better yet get the fries and carnie asada or chips and carnie asada the best. I have not tried a lot of stuff on the menu but I am pretty sure everything is pretty good."}
{"text":"Service is quick and the food is delicious. I frequent this place for lunch. The burritos tend to be a little on the sloppy side, but that's just because they're incredibly juicy and extremely packed inside, so I'm certainly not complaining about it.  Biggest tip: There is a small cart on the back wall with many side items that you can place into provided baggies. I *highly* recommend the spicy carrots. No extra charge!"}
{"text":"Always get the $.99 chicken tacos on Wednesdays, but this location was so good. The chicken was seasoned very good. The staff was nice and friendly. I will return this location next week."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this Roberto's it sucks. I would give it zero stars if i could. Employees don't give a shit, salsa bar is filthy, and you're going to pay for less food. I've paid $7 enough times for a carne asada burrito that was no bigger than a good sized taquito. This place is garbage, but I wont let one location ruin my Bertos fix. Unfortunately all Roberto's are a bit different in how they make each item, so be specific in what you may want on/ off your food. Go to the Ft. Apache and Tropicana or the Hualapai and Twain location, the difference is night and day. Great service with quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Order the carne asada nachos. I couldn't finish it, and I can eat a lot."}
{"text":"I went to this Roberto's this morning for a breakfast burrito, as I've been to other locations and had good experiences.  This one was different, however.  When I walked in the single employee working there was not friendly at all...almost seemed like I was bothering/inconveniencing him by coming in.  I asked what was in the breakfast burrito, and the employee stated \"egg, cheese, bacon, tomato, etc...\".  I asked if they have a ham, cheese and egg burrito because I don't like bacon, and he said \"yes\".  I then went ahead and ordered the ham, cheese and egg burrito, and asked for it 'to go'.  When I got to work and opened up the burrito, sure enough it was the original breakfast burrito with bacon.  Maybe its just me but I really look forward to a good breakfast burrito sometimes, and it was really a bummer to have to throw this thing out.  I may go back to other Roberto's locations, but I was not impressed with this one and won't be back."}
{"text":"Used to love this location but lately the quality has declined. Just went tonight and had my $20 order messed up, paid for extra guac... didn't get ANY guac on my burrito. Cashier seemed rushed to where he halfway didn't want to take our order. Definitely disappointed with the food and service lately, especially being a loyal customer. I've eaten Roberto's since I was a kid in San Diego. Not sure if I'll be at this location any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two instead of one stars for the simple reason that it's a Roberto's, and if I wasn't already married, I would marry Roberto's. This has the propensity to be the best Roberto's around because of the large dining room and view of the Strip from the beautiful, covered outdoor patio...BUT! I'll forgive that they got our order wrong, but I can't forgive the FILTH! Trashcans dirty and overflowing, dirty tables and drink areas, and disgusting  men's and ladies restrooms. No soap, no toilet seat covers, no paper towels.  We were the only ones there, so they could have been knocking out SOME cleaning! I hope I live to Yelp another day. See photos."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food but Roberto's is pricey for typical Mexican food. Love that they are 24 hours never closed. Salsa bar is usually clean and well kept. I just wish it wasn't so expensive lol but it's ok food I can make better lol"}
{"text":"The staff late night are friendly and sometimes hook you up by stuffing your plate with more meat! The tostadas are cheap and bomb to eat. My personal fav is the California burrito, use lots of lime and thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Great Mexican fast food. My favorites besides chicken tacos are the California burrito and pork burrito."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a breakfast burrito, here was one person waiting for their order in front of me. The cashier stood with her back to the counter and didn't even acknowledge that I was there for at least a minute while she texted on her cell phone. Then while I waited for my order, four other people came In and ordered. Well it's been about fifteen minutes and everyone has gotten their food and left and I am standing here. The same cashier begins counting the change in her money drawer when another person comes in to order and she ignores him. I still have no food. About five minutes has gone by and she puts a burrito in the counter. I go up and it is NOT what I ordered, instead it is the ticket before mines order several people ago! I stood at the counter for about three minutes watching her count her cash drawer and finally was able to get her attention and let her know that this order is wrong. She takes it, throws it in the counter takes my receipt and says something to the cook in the back. No apologies for the screw up or the fact that I have now wasted a half an hour waiting for my breakfast. I am not sure I will ever come back here again. Poor service and attitude. Use caution when coming here, you probably won't get what you ordered."}
{"text":"Still a great place for cheap mexican food. had a carne asada chimichanga for the first time ever. It was glorious. Taking a burrito and deep frying it is genius. period."}
{"text":"I like coming to this location when I'm craving carne asada fries because it is near my house.  Don't be alarmed by the bullet-proof glass behind the counter, the neighborhood may not be the best, but the staff are always friendly and the food hits the spot.  What I like about the carne asada fries here is that the fries and cooked perfectly!  I took an order to go and usually fries get soggy by the time I get home.  The fries were so crispy and delicious despite the mound of sour cream, guacamole, salsa, carne asada, and cheese that was piled on top.  I devoured the whole thing and every last bite was just still as good as the first, with that nice crunch.    Another thing that I like about this location is that they have the salsa pre-filled in little cups so you just have to tell them the amount you want before they give you your order."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! This is our last minute, tired, don't know what else to get, save the day kinda spot.  We can always count on a delicious Super Nacho to hit the spot. The staff knows us and know how we like our Super Nachos and NEVER give us any problems with our unusual requests! Kind of bummed they charge for the Horchata refills now but it's all good. It's understandable since people like my family can down like 3-4 cups each in one sitting. I apologize that I don't know them by name but the two ladies (one elder and one pretty young) and the younger man that usually takes our orders are always so nice! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very quiet place. No music so it felt awkward if my friends and I talk loud. Staff didn't really seem to like there job. I mean there's only three of them. Good thing about this place is the 24 hours and of course my all time favorite carne asadas fries. Yummmm expected to be full and ready to eat."}
{"text":"Ahh, Roberto's. Can't go wrong with the staple Mexican food offered here. Affordable prices, big portions, and the horchata is always a winner! Oh, it's also open 24-hours. We need one of these in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few items off their menu and the burritos are pretty good but if your looking for something affordable and delicious try the 1$ tacos every Wednesday!!!! So damn good!"}
{"text":"I had a late night craving for some tacos so I decided to give Robertos Tacos a try. I felt proud to give some business to a place other than Taco Bell or Del Taco but that pride was short lived. First off, the lady that greeted me was about as friendly as Roseanne Barr (not friendly). The tacos were as hard as man hole covers but would be great chew toys for your pet Rottweilers. The tacos were completely flavorless except for the overcooked chicken. The lettuce was yellow, brown, and horrid. The cheese was the only redeeming taste factor but, sadly, not enough to save the experience from being dreadful. So next time you're craving tacos and it's after midnight stick to Del Taco, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"I'm a regular and this is the best Roberto's location as far as the food quality. The other locations are usually more stingy with the ingredients (specifically guacamole and sour cream) and their French fries taste like taco shop fries and not fast food fries. I don't eat at Roberto's unless its this one at in the gas station. The food taste has been pretty consistent (hardly any \"they didn't make it that good today\" occurrences)- but of course nobody is perfect. Also I never had order errors after frequenting here for over 3 years. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I  can really only review the Breakfast Burritos at this location, but OMG...... they are good!!! I always get the Bacon Breakfast Burrito and I add Pico De Gallo! Then I get some red sauce from their salsa bar, and add red sauce on a bite for bite basis!!!! Seriously, add red sauce take a bite.... add red sauce, take a bite..... This is usually after a night I have been drinking, I wake up late and go get this magical hang over burrito. FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Before dropping my rental car at McCarran I knew I needed dinner but I just didn't feel like eating at the airport. Yelp found this joint and off I went.  This 100 or so unit chain located in Southern California and Nevada has a high amount of stores located in the Las Vegas area and I can see why. They are serving up large portions for a very wallet friendly price.  The portions and value are there but for me the taste left a bit to be desired. I wasn't able to detect much seasoning in my visit.  Ordered combo plate #1 which is a a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with refried beans and Spanish rice. The rice had to many crunchy kernels and the beans  were not seasoned. The taco was massive and had a nice deep fried tortilla. The lettuce and Cheddar-Cotija blend was fresh and liberally applied. The beef was underseasoned. The enchilada was just a gooey mouthfeel and the enchilada sauce didn't bring much flavor.  Overall, I would return if I wanted to just chow down but the lack of flavor really drops this place to just OK."}
{"text":"ALL the cashiers are rude AF and they need to learn some manners. They don't ever greet you they just stand there staring, waiting for you to give your order. Once my order was ready they just called it out, sat it on the counter and left. No \"thank you, enjoy\" nothing. On a different occasion, I was walking in and an employee happened to be walking in right before me, they didn't even hold the door open for me they just walked in and let it close on my face. Just RUDE! And I've formed this opinion after several visits, not just one. This location needs to reevaluate their staff because they're lacking in the customer service department. I gave it 2 stars because the food is decent though"}
{"text":"Didn't think that it was all that. The food was a little bland and uninspired, but that seems to be the state of Mexican food here in Vegas... Seriously, do I have to go to Del Taco to get a good chicken taco?"}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of Robertos locations throughout the valley, but this is the first time I'm actually reviewing a specific location. This one is actually pretty close to home, so driving back from going out around 4 AM this was the perfect place to get good food with awesome prices and it's open 24 hours a day!  We ended up ordering four things, two to go for later. We got the two chicken enchilada meal ($8.25), the bacon breakfast burrito with extra bacon and cheese ($5.95 plus $2.00 up charge), the carne asada quesadilla ($8.75) and the carne asada fries ($9.95).  Everything so fresh and delicious, the carne asada fries are to die for and I LOVE their breakfast burrito. The only concern was that we were going to share the chicken enchilada meal, but it came topped with lettuce (the boyfriend doesn't do lettuce lol) But that was our fault, because we forgot to ask for it on the side. Love this location, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We are trying this for the first time. Heard great things. Just so happens to be $.99 chicken taco Wednesday. So far, we've waited 30 minutes to get our 7 tacos. No special order. Nothing but the tacos. I swear there are 2 people working here. The nice girl working the counter and the guy in the back making all the food.  For those of you who haven't been here let me explain the set up. It is fast food- at least in style and set up ( fast is not a word I can use to describe this place). U stand in line, order, get ur food and go to a table that has obviously not been bused in quite some time.  The tacos are good. Shells look like they were onsite. But not sure it's worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Located within a Fabulous Freddy's, you'd be surprised at how busy this place gets. I come here at least once a week and its because out of all the Roberto's I have gone to in Vegas, this is by far the best one when it comes to service and quality of food. They are ALWAYS busy, but with this being literally the only location in Centennial Hills, its kind of expected. But the carnitas tacos! The carne asada nachos! The breakfast burrito! This place has restored my faith in Roberto's! Its located within a GAS STATION, so I don't understand what some of these other reviewers are expecting. If you want a 5 star, exquisite dining experience, please try somewhere else. If you want quick, greasy but delicious 'Mexican' food, eat here."}
{"text":"Great fast food mexican style, almost authentic - not your Taco Bell.  Have had the carne asada combo plate, dry burrito, taco combo plate and the chorizo morning burrito.  Fresh and hot cooked to order.  Inexpensive and nice condiments of cucumbers peeled, carrots, jalapenos, lemons, both green and red sauce.  For quick, fast mexican food 24 hours a day this is the place."}
{"text":"Service is prompt, environment is clean and staff is friendly. I always take large breakfast ordered to go, the order is always correct and the food is ALWAYS good. I have never once been disappointed. The carne carne asada breakfast burrito is my favorite!"}
{"text":"great Mexican food at great price .. there are lots of Robertos in town this one is the best"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a long time. I saw that they increased the price of their food. That's ok, and understandable. However the quality should be better. I bought some tacos today, and I was not impressed. The little chicken that was in the taco was just that, little. It was also dry as a bone. I will no longer be going here, and will be taking my business to Chipotle from now on."}
{"text":"It would be nice if they could teach the employees to answer the phone for a call in order."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time here, but it's been over a year since my last visit. I don't prefer dining at Roberto's locations, but this one is open 24 hours and I wanted tacos after midnight. They were pretty busy for a Thursday night, but then again it's summer and no school. I ordered two Adobada tacos from the less-than-enthusiastic cashier (I mean, seriously, no one EVER seems happy at the counter of these joints).   Anyway, we get our food plus the usual condiments (salsa, pickled jalapeño, radish, carrots). The corn tortillas were hard on the edges and dry. The pork was also not very tasty. I've had their Adobada before (at another location) and enjoy the marinated, juicy meat. It was nothing like that. Cooked much too long and crisped until there was almost nothing left. It was disappointing. I don't know if it was an off night, but if I do return to a Roberto's, which will be rare, it won't be this location.  [ 2014: Review #100 ]"}
{"text":"This Roberto's location is one of my favorites. They are clean and cool the food well. I have been to some locations where the food was undercooked and some that over cooked stuff. I don't mind this one because it's also in a convenient location."}
{"text":"Sign shows \"Under New Management\" and being lovers of Mexican Food and Alberto's in Cali- being from Hawaii we always look for an Alberto's or Roberto's Taco Shop.   There's a lot of parking available.  SERVICE: very friendly and welcoming w/smiles And very patient w/us ordering. When you're  served with a beautiful smile and genuineness the food tastes even more delicious.   FOOD: It was by far one of thee best carne Asada burritos and crunchy taco rolls and chicken tacos and quesadillas . Carne asada was very well seasoned-unlike Manu others who don't season their beef well and cover it under guacamole etc. they were very generous with guacamole and sour cream in our carne asada. Just simply delicious. They have a self serve bar for your typical condiments and self serve soda fountain and yessss they have horchata .  CLEANLINESS: As you can see from pictures it was very clean and welcoming. Restrooms just need a simple tidying up.  I love supporting small businesses and hard working immigrants and hardworking people period. if you're ever in Las Vegas-and want to eat good Mexican food. PLEASE go and visit them and it warranted a 5 STAR RATING."}
{"text":"Definitely not on my list of favorites. The cashier was not at all friendly, they didn't have any menudo on a Sunday and I didn't care for the flavor of the food.   First off, I went in wanting menudo. The sign stated that they had menudo on Saturdays and Sundays. Well, we went in on a Saturday night/ Sunday morning and they didn't have any menudo. Didn't help that the cashier was not at all friendly. This place just rubbed me the wrong way from the moment we walked in. Probably because the cashier looked pissed from the moment we walked in. We had just gotten off of work and wanted an easy meal and that was the reception we received.  The food in itself wasn't spectacular. The taco meat was very bland. They got my order wrong for the enchiladas. I ordered beef enchiladas and received pork enchiladas which were also bland in flavor.   I won't be going back to this place. Too many options in the area to stick with a bad one."}
{"text":"Food is good but they mess up my order every other time I'm there. I order a burrito with everything on it, they give me only beef. If I ask for \"no meat\" they add bacon. Drives me nuts. And to think that I've always tipped is insane. For what? They need a competent cashier to handle all the orders."}
{"text":"Everyone seemed really nice the place was clean and the employee were very nice but the prices were very expensive at this location the food wasn't that good I recommend their other location At Bermuda and St Rose food less expensive and the food tastes better."}
{"text":"Love getting food from here always fast convenient and so yummy. They have great prices for specials also."}
{"text":"Excellent as always! Always fast and great food. I love all the locations. The employees are always pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"This Roberto's taco is by far the best one! The staff is always very welcoming and this place is the cleanest!  The salsas are by far the best, compared to all the other Roberto's. I think they should incorporate the cleanliness, salsas, and service in all locations. Learn from this location."}
{"text":"I was a regular of Roberto's in the early 2000's when I first lived in Vegas.  After having moved all over most of the Southwest, I could not wait to return to Roberto's when I decided on moving back to Vegas.  The flavor of this cheap and easy Mexican venue is something that no other town or chain can replicate!    There are not many options for a full-course mexican meal at 3am, for a decent price.  My only advice is early morning hours, they are rather slow.  I will often stop in here on my way to work and load up for the day and the service isn't quite ready for prime time.  Food quality is still good though!"}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure. When I'm in the mood for the best tasting/ most unhealthy Mexican takeout, this is my stop.  I highly recommend the carne asada nachos, chicken tacos- roles and crunchy shell. Almost everything comes smothered in your choice of sour cream or guacamole and cheese. Need I say more?  This location is relatively new and I feel like it's cleanliness is better than some of the other locations.  So if you're looking for a cheat meal, give them a try."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for a couple years or so. They've had a new crew the last month and the food has suffered. Usually go for taco Wednesday and this is the second time the food has been below par. Undercooked tacos are no bueno! Not sure I'll come back and sad about it cause this has been my Wednesday tradition, but I like my food cooked thoroughly. I was wondering why they were not so busy, I guess more people are having bad experiences too. This place used to be really busy..."}
{"text":"Got the brrakfast burrito. Very good. I have also had the rolled tacos, carne asado tacos. Never got anything that wasnt delicious. Its great when you nrrd something good and quick. Lots of other locations too"}
{"text":"Decided to give it a shot despite the reviews. Ordered my food, the lady tells me to come to the window without reading back my order or giving me a total. Then I get up to the window and asks me if I still want my food because they're cleaning their grill or something. She was mumbling the last bit. Nevertheless I told her no, since I need to go back to work. Ended up getting Jamba Juice instead, maybe she did me a favor lol. It's a shame cause it's right down the street from my job."}
{"text":"Best Robertos in town always fresh and fast I drive the extra miles to go to this one they are not all the same"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!!!! Great hours. I can eat here several times a week. My favorites: wet bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tacos, California burrito, and carne asada nachos."}
{"text":"My husband always goes to this location, while I frequent the horizon ridge location.  I think today was his last trip here. The last two times They can't get an order right causing him to go back for it to be corrected.  They charged him .50 for a debit transaction when the sign states credit transactions would only be charged and I found a tooth pick hiding in my rolled tacos (which had no meat) and I almost choked.  Yes it's not fine dining but you are spending hard earned cash.  This place is a joke and gives the Roberto's  name a bad rap.  Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Robertos is really good.  We just ordered 15 chicken tacos and they were all so good. The service is always outstanding and the emoloyees are alway very nice. Price wise it is  very cheap, this is the only Robertos that I will go to.(all the others are a little off)  The only Negative is they have a lot of oil or grease. They need to let the food drain for just a tad bit.  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Can't live anywhere without 24 hour tacos!  Always get the flautas with chicken. You get 5 and a drink. Best deal. Wife gets chicken tacos so we come on Wednesday for the chicken taco deal. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"This place is awful! My carnitas was like where's the pork? Geez so disappointed Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"I love the burrito breakfast!! Test like heaven!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT go to this location!! Today is the 2nd time they've messed up my order & this one almost led me straight to the HOSPITAL! My husband specifically ordered 2 chimichangas with only carne asada, beans & cheese on the inside. On the outside we only wanted sour cream. I wrote this order verbatim & that's how he ordered it.   When he gets home with the food both chimichangas are smothered with guacamole & I am ALLERGIC to avocados. This is not a mistake on my husbands part because he knows I am allergic. Good thing I look at what I'm eating before I eat it because I would have ended up in the hospital because of their ridiculous mistake.   Last time I went, I ordered the same exact thing & the only thing inside was carne asada; no beans & no cheese. I don't understand what's so hard about getting an order correctly. I have leniency the first time because mistakes happen but 2 times & with something life threatening is ridiculous. I'm across town now, so I can't even go back to exchange my food for the correct items, nor should I have to waste my own time or my money for gas to get there.   DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!"}
{"text":"The menudo is the best!!! I go there every Saturday!!! They have great tacos too!! The guys that work there are nice. Must try the menudo on the weekend!!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. I ordered delivery through Postmates and they brought the wrong order. I understand that people and businesses make mistakes so I called to let them know. The guy who answered didn't speak fluent English so communication was tough but I did the best I could. I explained to him what I was missing from my order and all he said was okay and hung up the phone. I called back to ask if he knew my address and he said no. I told him I paid delivery fees and he hung up on me. I called back and he put the phone down so that it was off the hook and had me waiting for 20 minutes. I called back and the line was still busy. I believe he was intentionally trying to ignore me. Very disappointed and never ordering from Robertos again."}
{"text":"The people are always very rude here which sucks because it's right by my house ... lame  I think I will be going a different location they suck I ordered take out 10 minutes ago and when I got there 15 minutes after I called my order I still had to wait.... ? when I asked her why she said because there was a lot of people there yet no one was there and I called 15 minutes ago maybe even 20. The girl with the blonde hair and cat eyeliner is very nasty and so is the tall gentleman who looks like the manager I'm not sure  so I went home with my food and I'm expecting my delicious carnitas tacos and California burrito and they sucked it tasted nothing like Mexican food.  They get 1 star for warmness because they started making my food when I arrive but my food was take out I should of just went in and ordered instead of doing \"take out\" which I don't think they know what that means And this is the second time that they are RUDE!! And their food sucks ?"}
{"text":"It's fast food. It sort of passes for Mexican. It's not Taco Bell.  Ordering was kind of a pain because the employees at that time spoke almost no English. With that kind of experience, you'd expect damned good carne asada. 2 of the salsas were out and not replaced. The bathroom was dirty."}
{"text":"This location has the best, freshest food of any Roberto's in the valley (especially if you visit between 10am and 10pm, when the couple who owns the place is working)! I highly recommend the adobada tacos. They season the pork meat themselves and cook it up perfectly. The meat is not too greasy and the flavor is amazing! Other favs include the mix burrito which I get with chicken and beans. Come here if you are looking for quality food, large portions and a decent price."}
{"text":"Alright so tonight was the last straw for me. I used enjoy going to Robertos, I always order to go, my order is not difficult \"3 rolled chicken tacos with CHEESE & SOUR CREAM ONLY NO GUACAMOLE. 8 of the 10 times I've gone there this year have been WRONG. My order has been completely wrong. I could totally just open the box of my to go order in front of the lady to double check my order, is that my job? Shouldn't that be the businesses responsibility?  Today I received 3 BEEF ROLLED TACOS w/ 2 of the tacos with cheese. This is the most pathetic business . I will never step foot in a Robertos taco shop again."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed- I'm a tried and true fan of Robertos I've never been to this location but I was getting gas and decided I'd pick up dinner  First off the girl behind the counter was a snot she was just seemed annoyed that she was waiting on us  When I got home my order was incorrect - my tamales very fatty to make matters worse I found not one but two strands of hair We also ordered  taquitos they were stale - I'm still going to recommend Robertos to everyone- but maybe not if they are in a gas station and definitely not the one on Grand Montecito."}
{"text":"Oh Roberto's! I can't even begin to count the number of times you have been there to satisfy my drunk munchies! HAHA this location is conveniently open 24 hours and is clean & fast! The best thing on the menu is the Carne Asada Nachos!!! Mmmm! But if I'm feeling like I should be somewhat \"healthier....\" i get the Carne Asada Plate LOL Although Roberto's & \"healthier\" shouldn't even be in the same sentence..   I will say though.. One time I came when they were cleaning the whole kitchen and so the flat top grill was turned off.. They cooked our food in a separate frying pan which I've never seen them do and the food came out not so great.. So if you go when they are cleaning I suggest you take a rain check~   Muy delicioso~"}
{"text":"This place isn't horrible, it is what it is.  It's unhealthy fast food.  It's a good place to get decent food for a decent price.  Most of the stuff is fried so not the healthiest place to eat, but it's a nice treat on occasion.  Most of the staff speaks little English, and they aren't overly friendly, but they aren't mean.  You do wind up paying extra for extra condiments, and there are signs to not take more from the relish bar than you will eat, I don't know why they do that.  Regardless, I go here when I need a quick bite.  It's pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Sadly, must say I'm going to go back to the original location I frequent. Even though this location is literally a mile away vs the 3 miles- I got my typical Carne Asada fries home and they were barely warm.  Not only that, they were just oddly skimpy on everything.   The inside is dirty, the salsa bar was not only dirty, but not stocked well.  The order took like 15 minutes- the cooks looked too busy hanging out in back.  The girl up front was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Carne Asada burrito changed my life!"}
{"text":"Hungry- need authentic?  Check this place out.  1.  Portions - Nice and big for the hungry beast in you.  2.  Quality - Authentic and good. I really enjoyed the Nachos with beef and the Carne Asada Burrito. Ok, these are not authentic choices, I know, but I love lengua, and taquitos and they have the real stuff. Their little salsa bar with the two salsa's, green onions and pickled veges are great!  3.  Prices - A bit on the pricey side, comparing to a Del Taco or Taco Bell, but this is the real deal.  4.  Service- More or less self service, but good overall.  5.  Room - Plenty of room to sit, clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"I went here 3 times, every time, I received the rude, no smile service (from the same girl) I felt uncomfortable and was embarrassed I had brought my family to this place after telling them how good Roberto tacos (at another location) was, I had assumed the food and service would be similar. At this location the food tasted bad and looked like it was slopped on the plate.  I got the impression they didn't want my business and they got what they want, I will never go back. I should have got the message the first visit. Please let this not dissuade anyone from trying another Roberto's taco shop location though."}
{"text":"Cheap, good, authentic Mexican. Open 24 hrs.   Mixed burrito (beef and beans) - yummm.  The guac is nothing special so you can pass on that.   If you get a breakfast burrito make sure to ask for the sausage to be extra crispy, and get some lime wedges to squeeze on top."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito!!! Hells to YEAHHHAAYYY!!! Its a good place to get some fast grub for the evening or lunch.."}
{"text":"I ordered the #4 and it's around 2:35am there's two other gentlemen here besides myself and my boyfriend. My tacos were....well not like I remember Robertos ever being. They were awful. The chicken tasted like nothing, no flavor. I loved the beans and rice, but the taco shell and chicken were awful. I was not drunk and this wasn't a need for food to sober up it was a decision on which place on Cheyenne could I get food at this hour. My choices were tropical smoothie but it's freezing out or here.. I should've went to bed starving."}
{"text":"The service at this Roberto's keeps getting worse. If you do eat here make sure they get your order right. Since they don't repeat back what you ordered if they missed ringing something up or they ring it up wrong they look at you like it's your fault."}
{"text":"tastest damn great. Love this place. Only drawback is most of the menu is very caloric, but otherwise, it rocks!"}
{"text":"tasty Mexican fast food. The Carne Asada burrito here rocks world. Service is usually very good. love it."}
{"text":"Food was great! The quality is far superior than a few of the ones across the valley!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, unlimited condiments bar (lime, pickled veggies medley, cucumbers, scallions, salsa Verde y rojo). I ordered the lengua, carnitas, adobada tacos and tortilla chips with guac.  The cook the meat on the stove top so you get a nice sear/crisp to the meat. I didn't really like the Guac, it's blended so it's very much like a puree.   The tortilla chips and guac weren't that great. Chips seem to be made in house as it retains a lot of grease. The guac didn't have texture so it didn't taste great together. I think guac puree should be used in different dishes, not tacos and chips.  Staff was nice. I probably would not return."}
{"text":"The fat dumpty guy with long hair that works the drive through is an absolute idiot I added 3 rolled tacos to my order at the window and he rolled his eyes like I asked for a loan, this location is horribly slow and the food is garbage. Visit pepes down the road for better food for the same price and less attitude overall the food and wait is the worst part."}
{"text":"An Absolute Insult to Mexican Culture...Mucho Loco Pindeho Gringos.................................I would prefer to give my money to homeless people than one dime to Roberto's."}
{"text":"Good Roberto's. Food pretty consistent, and not out of ice like they always were back in the day.  Try the Carne Asada Nachos. Chips, cheese, Carne Asade meat, sour cream, gaucamole, refried beans, and salsa. One plate is a good size meal for one, or a snack for three.  Unless youre me, then it's for one. Me. Heh.  The Horchata is perfect here, and the parking lot is remarkable, not just saying that because I made out there once.  If you want a big meal that isn't nachos try a Chimichanga but with carna asada instead of the usualy choices. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I hate to drop a rating but I gave to in this case. The shiny newness has worn off leaving a handful of the least caring employees I've ever seen at a Roberto's. There is one younger lady that cares, the rest think it's a major inconvenience to do their jobs.   The latest blow to the rating is being told they're doing shift change and waiting ten minutes to be rang up and handed my food at the same time. I really have issues with cold food.  There are too many locations around to tolerate this."}
{"text":"Place is a dump to begin with, then they claim to change management as an excuse for drastic price hikes.  The machaca burrito was like 4.50 now its $7 dollars same price as a steak burrito. Definitely not worth it and notice no difference in the restaurant out side of higher prices."}
{"text":"Man I love Roberto's! Been eating here since I was a kid! Quick, cheap good food! This location is right by my house but I'm glad there are so many so no matter what side of town I'm on I can get my fix! I love their chicken Tacos Wednesdays when they are only $1. I haven't had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss kind of place. I usually only come here if it's late at night or when I don't feel like getting out of the car. It's alright."}
{"text":"Just a update that this one is fairly consistent and I've had few issues over the years. Even on a \"off\" day it's never bad, just maybe a tad dry/salty/greasier than I like.   I mostly order the same things when I go here. I get the California burrito (carne asada, pico, cheese, potatoes), carnitas burrito, super nachos, breakfast burrito, chicken taquitos or chorizo plate. I have delved off before, but I feel these are the better things to order so I stick with it.  The only thing I avoid though is shredded chicken here - I'm not a fan of it shredded and then sitting in a sort've sauce. I prefer grilled and diced style chicken at other places.   I always have found it amusing that somehow this is the unofficial hangout for teens who just got their cars. I guess there's not much up here they're allowed late-ish.   24 hours, fairly decent fast food, inside the Fabulous Freddys. Don't be afraid of gas station food, this one isn't seedy or anything. It's rather clean and big, with seating inside. No, it's not like my favorite hole in the walls where they don't speak English, but don't turn your nose at this chain.   It's decent late night food and is part of our rotation when we don't want to cook. I come at a certain time at night every night and usually on days we work. I don't know if that makes a difference as it seems its the same cook, but whoever is working after 10pm has been decent."}
{"text":"Some Robertos can be good. Some are not. This location is just okay. It's fairly clean and really doesn't have a ton of people coming into this location. Roberto's is always open 24 hours for people who need some seriously heavy drunk food!  Ambiance: 3 - Fast food shop style. Small kitchen with a good amount of chairs.  Service: 4 - The people were okay, they got our order done quickly. They were nice and spoke Spanish!   Food: 3 - There's a giant menu at Roberto's of fast food Mexican. Not really authentic food if that's what your looking for~!  Meh. The food was just alright. I've had better Roberto's from another location. I felt that the carne asada was a little dry and flavorless here. Mexican isn't really my food of choice, but man, is it filling!!  However, if you do plan to eat here, I suggest the breakfast burrito or the carne asada fries (which are not that bad, even with the meat)!!!"}
{"text":"Aye carramba!  This spot has been a regular for me eve since moving to this side of town. Located inside of the Fabulous Freddys carwash/gas station, it is convenient to come, fill up, get your car clean and grab some food to go.  Regular buys Carne asada fries/nachos 3 rolled tacos chicken with guacamole and sour cream Carne asada burrito  All come in a very hefty size. Oh and they are not shy with their sides at all. Wait time here is usually under 10 minutes, but you can always call in for a pick up. Don't forget to ask for the pickled carrots and onion, yes they have it, just behind the counter.  The only down side of the location is, with all the business coming in for gas, car washes and regular convenient store transactions, it is hard to find parking. So be prepared to wait during the mid day, for a spot.  They do have a limited seating area for eating in. So come get your mexi  fix in a clean and very friendly toco shop."}
{"text":"This place is super close to my house and Ive eaten there dozens of times. I like it, their chicken tacos they are always crispy and hot sometimes a little greasy but hey if you get a deep fried taco its going to be but it is great. Their carnitas are fantastic. I love the shrimp cocktail. Ive never had anything there that I did not like. The breakfast burritos are fat and a good price. Their two slasa offerings are both good I like them both. But the best thing about them is their staff, they always smile when they see me and say hello they offer great customes service and I will continue to go here as often as I can. Usually Taco Wed when they have a deal on their chicken tacos and  love me some chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"Good pricing for the portions. The kids loved the tacos and quesadillas. The green salsa was good and the salsa bar was stocked with cucumbers, radishes, onions and pickled carrots too. Very clean and fresh."}
{"text":"They're food is so greasy and it doesn't taste good at all I've tasted way better tacos. ROGOS TACOS ARE THE BEST"}
{"text":"Great food but don't go if you ate in a hurry.  I was in the drive thru for 20 minutes with 1 person in front of me."}
{"text":"If I can put 0 stars I would. I ordered asada fries ($8.10) without the meat and he rings in fries with guacamole, cheese, beans, sour cream, and pico and comes out to $8.17. Uhhh...How are you gonna charge me more for something that is less?! Ridic. I love robertos, but after today, nope. Byyyye!"}
{"text":"You jacked up my order AGAIN.   It is bad enough that you were out of chicken, but what part of NO TOMATOES was hard to understand?  This location consistently gets orders wrong.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in for takeout after work. Simple order; Carne Asada Nachos with an extra side of guacamole and a sweet tea (which is listed on the menu). I got an order of Nachos with absolutely ZERO guacamole, and a raspberry tea. As soon as I realized the error, I got in the car while attempting to call ahead so that I didn't have to wait. You do realize that people can hear the background music when you pick up the handset and hang up rather than answering, right? I kept calling the whole drive back, to no avail. When I finally arrived, I had to shout repeatedly before anyone even came out of the back, and then I was treated like the error was my fault even though the order ticket CLEARLY stated my order. The blatant disregard for customers as evidenced by this encounter will serve as the reason that I will never return to this location again.   And if you do not serve an item correct the sign rather than passing off something similar. Sweet tea and Raspberry tea are two very different drinks."}
{"text":"Went last night to get dinner. Ordered the food...forgot to order side of sour cream..so did another transaction to get the needed cream. No biggie. Get our food and I didn't get the cream...I also forgot..had to go back in to get it. No problem..showed receipt, he acknowledged not giving it to us.   Get home dip my quesadilla into the sour cream and had to spit it out. The sour cream was SALTY....as if a whole container of salt was mixed in. Threw that $1 side of cream out. Nothing like wasting money. Go and take a bite of the chimichanga...SAME THING!! Sour cream that is all over the chimi is SALTY. Now I'm pissed. Go and take a bite of my carne asada fries...same thing!!!   I just find it irritating after spending $30..portions of the food was inedible, some had to be trashed. So unfortunate because I haven't ever experienced something like this from Robertos."}
{"text":"This is a stand up place. Front worker always if friendly and actively helps me to create the best meal for my buck. I love that, you dont get that at a jack in the box or a taco bell. 10/5"}
{"text":"I switch between going to this location and the one at Fort Apache and Trop, but they are equally good and both open 24 hours. My regular order is 3 beef tacos with plenty of green salsa on the side. The salsa is a bit spicy for me yet delicious! Also the horchata here is perfect.... not too sweet, not too watery. I have also fallen in love with the chicken burrito. It sounds like it could be plain but the chicken is shredded and so juicy, and also having tons of onions and peppers leaves me in heaven. Also a fan of a good ol' bean and cheese burrito and beef taquitos.  The prices are very fair too, even though they were raised about a month ago. I believe the beef tacos were $3.05 before and now are $3.35. Not a huge change and I would much rather they raise prices a bit than decrease portion sizes. My only real beef so far is that burrito sizes vary. Sometimes it is very generous, sometimes not, so you never know exactly how much you'll get.  Also a note that Roberto's serves their menudo on the bone. I love menudo but hate eating it off the bone, and once heard some unknowing customer complain to them about how she was eating their menudo and almost chipped her tooth on the bone. She acted like a douche about it, so.... \"if you don't know, now you know!\""}
{"text":"price- reasonable staff -helpful and attentive portions - huge(enough for two, if you get the chimichanga plate) food- too salty, as u know when you cook or add anything with cheese, it has it's own salt, no need to add more to the meats...pls kill the salt and then you can taste the goodness of the food...ty"}
{"text":"The worst meal my husband and I have ever had. Dry meat, greasy burrito, poor quality. We will never go back again!  To give my order the girl didn't understand chicken instead of beef, or how to ring it up!"}
{"text":"For a taco shop this one is good. They always get my order right which is a big deal. Love the spicy carrots. The tamale is yummy and the nachos are good too."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate this establishment 0 stars. They have the worst customer service of all the Robertos I've been to in Vegas. No one will greet you when youre dining in. Even when you stand in front of the cashier to order they wont say anything, they just wait for you to start your order. I mean, if I am choosing to spend my money here, you should be thankful you have a job. We come here for the carne asada fries. They are the best in town, its too bad their employees have no type of customer service. Also, save your time, and DO NOT GO THROUGH DRIVE THRU. Ever. It will be at least 40 minutes to get your food, including the 15 they make you wait until they answer the mic."}
{"text":"The thing about Roberto's is that they are all different. It's not like McD's where a Big-Mac is a Big-Mac wherever you are...  This Roberto's is OK for this side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sorry I cheated on you with Durango Taco Shop. It'll never happen again. It wasn't even worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the carnitas burrito enchilada style . Ive gone to various locations but no one does this specific burrito like this exact one !"}
{"text":"This place is great for a late night grub. It is as close you can get to a authentic taco shop. There are a lot around town so you can always find one somewhere near you."}
{"text":"Sneaked into Las Vegas last month (Lol! Many of you know why!) and indulged Roberto's! It's fresh and fast. I saw the three orders before, the Carne Asada fries, I had to try them. Delicious. So delicious that I had to take one of my chicken tacos back to my hotel. I had those carrots and peppers before and packed up almost a 1/2 pint! My only wish Roberto's was north of the boarder in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the restaurant is clean. The staff is nice sand helpful. The food is incredibly reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. They also have great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The Order was correct, but deceived a customer about the Carne Asada Burrito and wrote the wrong names on the wrapper."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not knowledgeable enough about Mexican food or something, but I really don't understand the hype about this place/chain. Everyone is always talking about how great and \"authentic\" it is, but it just seems like standard, uninteresting Mexican fast-food fare to me. Plus, from what I have always heard, although Americanized-Mexican dishes rely on mounds of cheese, real, authentic Mexican food is rarely covered in a cup and a half of shredded cheddar. I don't know, though The food was okay and the service was okay and the prices are okay, but that's really all I can say about it...it's okay. I will say that, when I was in, their salsa/veggie bar was absolutely wrecked. Maybe some quality salsa would've somehow elevated my rolled tacos to another level, garnering another star in the process, but there was no way I was going to pick through that mess to find out. Hell, maybe I'll try it again and it'll knock my socks off. If so, I'll be sure to update this review accordingly, but as of now, I'm in no real rush to go back and see."}
{"text":"Will not go back. Food was inedible. I ordered beef burrito. Couldn't even chew the meat. Was so gross just threw it in the trash. Not to mention the girl behind the counter kept messing everyone's order up as she didn't understand what we were saying"}
{"text":"Mmm Roberto's Carne Asada Nachos..... mmm rolls taquitos with fresh guacamole!!!! I've been to many Roberto's but since my store is in the diagonal shopping center I decided to give this one a try. My bf, friends and I went there late at night, around 11:30pm and it had a decent crowd. The food is a bit salty, but the meat is very well seasoned! I love the carrots & jalapeños they have sliced, it has the perfect amount of spiciness. The carne asad nachos & fries are perfect for a group of friends who want a full filling snack ;)  The only reason why I give this place a 4 was because the bathrooms were kinda dirty~"}
{"text":"To start off, they got the order wrong.  You know that feeling when you stop somewhere because you're craving something?  UGH!  Not only did they get the order wrong, but it was with two things that were so hot that my stomach was burning by the time I finished.  Good, but hot.  The guacamole was watered down, the salsa was watered down, and the refried beans were watered down!  Saving money maybe?  The rice wasn't done the same as usual Robertos either.  Too salty.  I was really disappointed.  Skip this Roberto's and go to a different one.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Just plain awesome. Down here  LA, we have Albertos, Albertacos, Rigabertos, but it just doesn't come close to Robertos. Good fresh quality at a decent price. At this location, you can get it anytime, assuming the gas station didn't close its doors.  Love it! Do get the Carne asada burritos or tacos and ask for the green/red sauce to go with it. Thanks to my buddy Kong for introducing me to this place in Vegas, but I think I have already tried one of their SD locations.  http://www.robertostacoshop.com/locations/"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the other roberto's taco ships but this one is very consistent. They have never failed to please for quick cheap Mexican food. Portions are plentiful, even tacos are well filled. Carne asada fries are my go to! Also love the chimichangas and lengua tacos, even the fish tacos will satisfy my cravings! Green and red sauces are a must as well!"}
{"text":"i have mixed feelings about this previous visit. Food taste great as always. Like i literally devoured my enchiladas lol. It's my goto place for a fast stop for enchilada's.  The reason I'm having mixed feelings is because my food was done really fast & yes i get it, it's a fast stop but it shouldn't be that fast it was literally done within 5 minutes.  My beans were cold, my food was lukewarm. :( i had to warm everything up as soon as i got home.   I'll come back again because i normally do since it's down the street from my house, so the only complain i have is that the food should be hotter. I like my cheese super melted!"}
{"text":"Very fast today. Good customer service.  Food is hot (not spicy hot) and delicious. I love there bacon breakfast burritos"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I only order the bean and cheese burrito. I substitute cheese for rice, but for some odd reason they don't view rice as a substitution but something more expensive. I got charged $1.70 extra for rice. This has happened twice so I know it is not a fluke. I won't be going back. They aren't doing anything special I can't do at home."}
{"text":"The W. Warm Springs location is the worst. Poor customer service at its finest. I love Roberto's don't get me wrong but this locations is king for screwing up your order then arguing with you about it instead satisfying the customer. I called a pick up order in today and asked and paid for extra chicken in my enchiladas. I get home and begin to eat and notice that my enchiladas are filled with way more bell peppers, onions, and enchilada sauce than meat. I'm not a complainer and I rarely send food back but there was barely any meat at all so I finished the first one dreading having to call back complaining and/or go back up there for them to make it over because I was starving. When I cut open the second one it was totally disrespectful not only did they fail to give me the extra chicken that they charged me for there wasn't even enough meat to be called an chicken enchilada in the first place. I didn't want to go through the hassle of calling them about something so petty but I did because I felt like I didn't receive $12 worth of food. When I called the woman who answered the phone was super offensive and confrontational. I was very pleasant when I called I didn't think it was a big deal, I was simply letting them know that they should check the proportion of the mixture because the vegetable to meat ratio is completely off balanced. Either she wasn't trying to hear what I was saying or she didn't understand what I was saying because no matter what I said she kept saying bring it back with the receipt. I sent my daughter back up there with what was left and she got loud and ignorant with my daughter and made a scene in the store. My daughter called me and I called back and she told me she's not doing anything because I ate most of it. I asked to speak to a manager and she refused she first told me that he's not going to give me anything because I ate it and then she told me he was walking out the door. I told her then just give me the money back and she said she would give me only $2 back the price of the extra checking. I told her to just give me back half and I would leave it alone. She told me she's not even going to give me $2 back and that she's giving my daughter 2 enchiladas without extra chicken. I told her I don't want any food from that store and to give me half of my money back or let me talk to someone who could. She told me that she's not going to let me talk to anyone else and that she giving my daughter 2 enchiladas and she hung up on me. I have never been talked to like that or treated like that in my life. I'm very respectful and I give respect so I expect it back in return. I will never go back to that location again and I probably won't ever patronize with Robert's period if this is the type of service they foster!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a few times and every time, my food has been made with love. I'm so picky and they've never once messed up my complicated order. I just got some carnitas a bit ago and I've fallen deep into what I believe is love. Very juicy and seasoned so perfectly. Whether it's been after a night out at 3am or a breakfast burrito before work, it's always been a great experience."}
{"text":"Great location. About time to have one on the north east side of Vegas. Not a big seating are inside but it works. The employees are wonderful. This one has a special for almost every day of the week.. On Wednesdays are Chicken tacos for 99 cents. I had it. And it was a little dry, had to add alot of green sauce. But it was good. The carne asada burrito in my book was tastier than other robertos. The Steak tasted fresher. So did the pico de gallo."}
{"text":"Roberto's was definitely a winner in my book. I'm from San Diego where I grew up on Mexican food.   The facilities inside were very clean and that's always a plus.  I ordered the carne asada fries and 5 rolled tacos. I would recommend both and come back to order both.  I'm a fan and would come back when I need my authentic Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Cheap affordable Mexican food. The Carne Asada burritos are great. Locations all over Vegas."}
{"text":"So last night my girl and I went to pick up some food. She always gets the same thing. Bean and cheese burrito with adding sliced avocado. The counter help Martin said they can't do that! We say well all the others do. And he says \" I'm not going to put up with this\" we were shocked!! If I was 25 I would of dragged him over the counter but I'm better than that!! This is not what customer service should be!!! Failed Martin!!!"}
{"text":"Never crowded, service is quick and efficient. Food is typical Roberto's. Love their enchaladas and rellanos."}
{"text":"What I expect from a robertos. They have good service and good food."}
{"text":"I've been to Roberto's about 4 times this was my first time at this location and my last which sucks because it's so close to my house... beside the point, the customer service (which I'm not expecting four seasons but at least normal common human decency) was beyond horrible the girl (didn't get her name but she had pretty blue eyes... masked by her horrible personality) didn't even look at me when I walked in so I was looking at the menu waiting for her to acknowledge me and then when she continued talking to the staff for over 5 minutes which feels like forever when you're doing nothing but waiting for someone to take your order. After I ordered I went to the little sides bar and got my cucumbers and sauces one of the staff in the back yelled something at me really couldn't hear so I asked if he was talking to me and they both said in Spanish thinking I didn't know what she was saying \"is this idiot deaf\" let's say that would usually throw me off the edge but I let it go because I was in a good mood then when I got my order the drink I ordered wasn't filled and she asked me more like forcefully and irritated by the fact I was there said do I want ice and I said yes not knowing at this location you have to put your own ice then they fill your drink (the specialty drinks like horchata)... idk but I've never done that at a restaurant before so I didn't know the way they operated and her rude stare and acting like I was a \"deaf idiot\" really wasn't helping either. So I put my own ice in handed her the cup she filled my drink and then slapped it down looked like she was going to get a top for my drink and then couldn't find one I guess and helped the next guest without saying a word so I stood there unsure if she was ever going to get me a top for my drink which she didn't and knowing I was obviously an idiot or idk possibly confused at the lack of service she could have pointed me in the direction of a lid or at least said here's your drink b*tch in fact if she would have said here's your drink b*tch I'd probably be more satisfied than her complete ignorance and act of irritation about me being there. So I was left very confused, pissed and assaulted. My good mood was ruin, thanks Roberto's (and yes I directly blame Roberto's because there are many reviews complaining about her and obviously she's still there). I'd like to call and speak to a manager however from reading other reviews I'm sure that won't do any good. Very disappointed.   Ps my carne asada had no flavor and was chewy, work on it."}
{"text":"This place totally sucked!  When I first walked in, it seemed okay, but when I went to the restroom to wash my hands, there were filthy paper towels all over the place and it was just disturbing.   I didn't let that get to me because I figured maybe they just didn't clean it after a huge crowd came in or something lame.  So we ordered the taco salad special (which was way overpriced), chips and salsa and the Carnitas plate. The chips were totally saturated with oil, The Carnitas was disturbing with all the grease at the bottom of the plate and it cost way too much.  The chick behind the counter didn't seem interested, even forgot to give us our cup for the soft drink machine.   Definitely two thumbs down. Save yourself a bunch of money and find a roving taco truck, less heartburn from grease and more bang for your buck.   Saturday, February 21, 2015 at approximately 8 PM"}

We ordered chips and salsa (which was way overpriced), the Carnitas plate and the taco salad special.  The chick behind the counter didn't seem interested.

{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised. The space is a little peculiar. It feels like a 70s throwback. That aside, they were very friendly, clean and the food came quickly. Taste was good, no ill after effects and reasonable prices. Horchata was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a Roberto's with good customer service. They kinda look at you like you don't know what you want to eat. I simply ordered a carne asada breakfast burrito with no cheese and the cashier made it the most complicated thing to order.   Other than the service, the food is very good! Roberto's is the best place to come for those late night cravings because they're open 24 hours & most have drive-thrus. This location, however, doesn't have a drive-thru and parking can be tough if you come at a busy time.   It's a bit pricy, but I assume you're paying for the huge portions. Here are my favorites:  Carne asada fries -- I can only share these delicious fries with someone because I can never finish it. It's probably the best thing there, but there's so much. And you really have to finish it in one sitting cus soggy fries aren't good the next day.   Chimichanga -- The chimichanga is to die for, yet the chicken is sometimes dry... maybe I'll try the carne asada next time!   Carne asada breakfast burrito -- this burrito has eggs and potatoes in it! I never like the cheese in there because it's always sprinkled in one section so you jut get a bite-full on cheese. Eh.    Roberto's is consistent. Any one you go to, the food tastes the same. I just wish the customer service was better."}
{"text":"This is a fast food family owned Mexican restaurant with sit down quality.  Some of my favorites are the adobado-pork loin taco and I put Verde sauce on it with tomatillos. Their Chile Colorado is fantastic as well as their famous chicken tacos on Wednesdays for only $1 a piece.  The number 4 daily special Carne Asada with refried beans and rice is out if this world, with lean, marinated sirloin in a big soft taco."}
{"text":"Good stuff here at a great price.  No complaints from me. The \" price to what you get\" ratio is perfect. The chicken burrito is very tasty too.  Dollar for dollar, one of the best places to eat if your on a budget."}
{"text":"We go here quite a bit due to convenience. I think the quality's gone down a bit since they first opened. The food's decent but nothing really stand out, the service is mediocre but they're fairly quick and close to our house.  The California burrito served at other locations includes sour cream and guac, not at this one though they charge you extra."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food? than here it is... very clean,  staff is very cool, they have made there green salsa way better now, everything is homemade...its  delicious...I love there chimichangas...yummy and there orchata,drinks. .."}
{"text":"always clean never too packed aside from late night munchie crowds. I got the carne Masada combo with rice and beans. no complaints here. located in a good part of town by the 215. for $8.00 it is much sometimes. sometimes if you get the females at the register they seem to cook you more for your dollar. I come once a week or so but its worth it."}
{"text":"There is something about this place. My Cali and my Vegas Friends speak of this place like they are crack heads. I had to see what all the fuss was about, I don't just eat anything being a fitness model.   I have to take it easy. Let me cut to the chase this place is the opposite of healthy. If your a healthy eater with a balanced gut... man this place will destroy you lol. I asked the cashier Juan what he recommends he was not much help after  telling him it's my first time here. I ended up getting the carne asada fries, Shredded chicken chimichanga, & two bean & cheese burritos. WHAT! I was hungry, jk it was for my lady and I to split. The flavor was good it left a greasy lard taste in my mouth and left me quite gassy.   If your used to heavily fried Mexican Foods & your tummy can handle this is a good spot for you my friend.   1. Fast  2. Convenient  3. Affordable  4. Open 24hrs"}
{"text":"Terrible service . Foods bomb but the employees attitudes are terrible and a 20 min wait in an empty drive thru is stupid ."}
{"text":"I order a chicken taco plain and get a chicken taco combo plate rice and beans. ????  Didn't pay much attention to the price being that other food was ordered.  Ok, so I take it back and said I wanted a chicken taco plain. And cashier throws his hands up and says awww come on!  And says next time order it without cheese.  To me, and prob most people with common sense, I thought that's what PLAIN meant!  He had such audacity.  Very rude.  Shouldn't be dealing with the public."}
{"text":"First time to this location and will probably go more often. We love Roberto's tacos, and the food is pretty consistent throughout all the locations, so far...Actually this was the first time that I ordered a beef burrito. And the reviews do not lie, this thing was HUGE. I was only able to eat half as I was also eating some rolled tacos that hubby had ordered. I love the crunch of the corn torillas.   Back to the burrito. I think it was a little salty for my taste although it had good flavor and the beef was shredded and really tender.  since it was my first time, I'm not sure if this is how it usually is, but it was good with the side of guacamole, sour cream and salsa. We had to pay extra for the side of guacamole and sour cream, but for the portion they give you its worth it. I've paid for these same sides elsewhere and gotten only a third of what you get here.   Love the pickled carrots, onions and jalapeno's. The salsas at this location were not spicy at all.   The workers here are friendly with smiles on their faces! The restaurant was pretty clean as well.   We visited this location at around 2p and so it was pretty empty, but there was a steady flow of customers coming in, mostly takeout."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here all the time and always get the Carne Asada Burrito with extra green sauce on the side. My wife sometimes gets the California Burrito, which is also very good! I honestly never order anything else so can't give an honest review of the rest of their offerings, but from the 20+ carne asada burritos I've had, this is a definite 5/5!"}
{"text":"The only good thing at robertos is the carne asada fries. The quesadilla has more onions than meat and the tacos are drenched in grease"}
{"text":"Someone told me that Roberto's is the best Mexican restaurant around here so I gave it a try.  I cannot say I agree with that opinion. It's not that the food is bad, but I wouldn't call it the best at all.  To be fair, the only outright terrible item I had there was the guacamole - it was the consistency of SOUP- horrid!!    Now, I also had a bad experience when the cashier charged me more than was stated on the menu and didn't speak enough English to resolve the problem. She had to call the manager and have me speak to her before I could get a refund. The problem was that they changed their prices in the register without updating their menu.  I was so annoyed that I swore to myself I'd never go back, but then I decided to try again. I  mean, mistakes do happen.    This time there a woman working in the kitchen who I recognized from before.  She said to the cashier that I was the woman who cheated them last time! Hey- hablo espanol, mujer!   You better believe I watched her closely to make sure she didn't spit in my order, 'cause she sure was giving me the evil eye. I've never gone back there- too disappointed.  But don't let my little adventure stop YOU!  If you don't mind runny guacamole and don't make the people in the kitchen angry, you should be all right.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I honestly would recommend this Robertos to Everyone. ! Went here last night/ morning almost 3am and everything was just so fresh ! The guy was by his self with three orders , but had everything fresh and done in a good ammount of time. You can never go to any other Robertos or as the one that they changed to \"Ponchos\" and get fresh good food the way this Robertos does it ! Happily satisfied !"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 because it's cheap, always open and fills the void.  The only down fall is if u order more than 2 breakfast burritos at a time because they always jack them up.  Late night run is on point.   Plus this location makes them the fullest. Other ones in town their burritos aren't as big."}
{"text":"While this wasn't bad, it wasn't massively fantastic.  I ordered a taco salad to try to get some greens in my diet, and it was very little lettuce, mostly meat and beans.  The carne asada in the salad was ok, chopped very tiny so if it was tough I couldn't tell.  The best part of this salad was the taco salad shell was actually fried fresh, which I've never seen anyone do before.  It was very tasty.  Husband had a chicken burrito plate which was massive for only $5.00.  He thought the chicken tasted weird, as if it was cooked in cambells chicken noodle soup.  I thought his rice tasted nice and light and fluffy, and his beans were ok.  He had a cheese quesadilla on the side that I liked a lot.  I'm not sure if we'll go here again, because as usual when we seem to eat this kind of food lately, our tummies regret it later."}
{"text":"Best Taco Shop EVER! Fresh & hot food! Very delish!"}
{"text":"The rolled tacos were like chewing hard rubber and the carne asada burrito had a stale tortilla around bland meat.  Having enjoyed Robertos in other cities, I was very disappointed in the quality here and will not be back."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast burritos! We also had the menudo which was ok. It was all meat and no corn which was kind of disappointing but I would defiantly go for other food items"}
{"text":"Nice place, food is good for mexican fast food.  clean.  decent service"}
{"text":"Okay - this might not be the food find of the year and were not talking about anything earth shattering... but it needs to be said.  Roberto's tacos has 99cent  chicken tacos on wednesday!  Talk about cheap eats!  Everyday I struggle with the \"where to eat a cheap lunch --- other than subway\"  ... dilema.  So these crunchy and tasty little tacos do the trick!  The taco is premade, but they fry it up and stuff it with cheese and lettuce.  Its that simple and it is that good.  I ate 5 tacos for lunch and went back for dinner and ate 4 more!!!!!  BTW - this particualr Robertos is in the nicest gas station I have ever been in!  Do not be afraid of a taco shop in a gas station."}
{"text":"This place was really good. A little pricey, every time we ordered something shed put in one number which was on the menu and then add a few more cents-a dollar which was kinda shady since we actually removed stuff from what we wanted (no sour cream, no cheese etc)   The staff was not friendly. I talked to two girls neither one even spoke except to tell me my total, or that our order was ready.   The chips were pretty expensive $3 something but really tasty. Salsa selection sucked. They have one red and one green both liquids, no chunky salsa or any other kind, just super hot red saucy stuff and green saucy stuff. There were a lot of other condiments, there were green onions, radishes, cucumbers jalapeños, and carrots.   Overall I really liked this place and I'm glad we found it and that its 24hrs!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Carnes asada nachos are my favorite but recently branched out to try a variety of tacos and burritos and pretty much everything is good.  Burritos are huge!  The lengua is really good.  Rolled tacos are a great snack and my daughter loves them.   The burritos get a little pricey by the time u add sour cream and other items that are optional.  But consistently good food"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I go here at least once/week. I've only had the California Burrito and cannot recommend it enough. Friendly staff (they know my order when I walk in) and great burritos."}
{"text":"If you're a local in Las Vegas, you've pretty much have had Roberto's before. Food usually the same, service might be different. What I'm posting about is the service. Specially getting food at night. We had ordered take out over the phone, so our food would be ready by the time we got there. We get there, and the gentlemen who work there said we were late picking up our food. They said over the phone it would be ready in 10 mins, but we got there in 20 mins after the order was placed. My thought was wow...I didn't know I the customer had to be on time?! They handed me my food, and my drink...that had no lid. I mean no lid not a big deal right..but you expect your pick up order to be ready 100%. I go get my lid and carrots one of the workers shoved me out of the way to add more carrots...I don't know if the worker though I was a ghost or something..but really..come on guys. Step your game up."}
{"text":"Strong odor of sewage as we parked. We went into the place and it smelled like an overflowing Port a Potty on a 115° day out in the sun. Lost my appetite and went to a different Robertos instead. I'm not going to order food from a restaurant that smells like that. Get your shit together !!!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and this one is right by my house, lucky for me it is one of the best ones I have been to. I tried Faustos (once), right across the street and it just does not compare to Roberto's. I am here at least once a week. Everything is good here; tamales, burritos, tacos. The refried beans are excellent, that's like the basis of judging a good mexican place, imho."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (July 2010) and I can't say that this place is really that great. I've had great Mexican food (Las Palmas in Oakland), mediocre Mexican food (El Balazo in Pleasanton) and really bad Mexican food (Los Tres Compadres in Yukon) and I'd say this is in the mediocre range for sure.   Both times I've went my sister and I ordered the chicken nachos. First time, we split them, second time we each got our own and let me just tell you, $17 for take out Mexican food nachos is a rip-off. They're decent, but they're not even close to worth that price.  The other thing I don't like is that they don't have water at this place. I don't drink pop or alcohol - I like to drink water with my meals, and their soda fountain doesn't have a water tab, nor will they fill you up a cup in the back. What the hell?!   Their salsa is decent but their marinated carrots are not good - and they can't even fit in the little condiment cups because they're cut into thick carrot strips. There's also WHOLE green onions on the salsa bar. Um, explain how the heck I'm supposed to eat an entire green onion. I could understand if they were chopped up, but really?!  The last time I ate here, my sister and I were going to walk home since it's only like 2 miles away - we got super sick and almost passed out (we had water with us), had to sit down on the sidewalk and take a breather. I definitely think it was the food because we felt nauseous right from the get-go. So yeah, unfortunately Mr. Roberto, we're coming back no more."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Roberto's I've been to in terms of cleanliness and decor. The slate wall looks upscale, along with the granite tables. It doesn't look so skeezy, as some Robertos' do.   When it comes to the food, it's basically the same as all the others. I noticed this location piles on the green bell peppers (or is it cactus? It looked like bell peppers, but tasted like nothing) which wasn't so great, and were skimpy on the sour cream and guacamole. It wasn't the end of the world, but it wasn't as satisfying as other times I've had their chicken nachos.   The service was great, and quick. All things that are nice when going for a food run at 1 AM. This Roberto's is A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"I come here probably twice a month. Always order a carne asada burrito and 3 rolled tacos. They have been very consistent with my food and the service is great. Sometimes you might have to wait 5 to 10 minutes for your food depending on how busy you are but its expected. Their carne asada nachos are hit or miss which is why I stick to the burrito and rolled tacos. If you are looking for a quick lunch or dinner and crave Mexican food... Go here."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef taco combo and a burrito combo. The taco was greasy and not appealing. I didn't even attempt to eat the other one. Halfway through my boyfriend's burrito he found a wooden stick inside. Not cool. Overall a bad experience at this Roberto's. Don't think I will come back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit my parents down in Vegas, we always try to make a stop at Robertos. Both the chicken and shredded beef tacos are good. The chicken taco are actually really good when you buy them on a Wednesday as they are on sale for $.99 (regularly priced at $2.39)."}
{"text":"The food is always good at this chain. The customer service could be better but we have still came back for years because of the great prices and great food. They could maybe hire someone with a little more personality as their cashier. No matter which location I go to, it's all the same."}
{"text":"My daughter lives nearby and suggested we try it if I like mexican food. Wow, I was NOT disappointed! I ordered a chicken chimichanga.  The chicken was plentiful, shredded and tasty.  Enough beans, and fresh veggies to make it a mound of the most delicious dinner that was enough for 2 feedings.  Daughter had her fav: chicken quesadilla.  It was over-stuffed with cheese.  She was pretty happy.  Service through the window great and fast and very affordable!!  I can't wait to go back when I visit the next time!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's...mainly because me being a bartender I get off at about two in the morning and this place is always open :]"}
{"text":"Love this location. The breakfast burritos are the bomb as well as the Carne asada fries. They're also open 24 hours."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get chimichanga's imo. The Chicken chimi, Carne asada chimi,and Bean & Cheese chimi are usually my own picks!"}
{"text":"Love that it's 24 hours and close to home. It's a great quick fix if you're craving for a burrito. I always get the chicken torta but the reason why I give it 3 stars because they always give me a weird ass look for adding an egg in it. LOL! I just love my eggs. It might not be traditional but I love it."}
{"text":"The food is always good and I've never had a problem with the service. I thought that being located in a gas station might raise an issue with quality but it doesn't. I would recommend this location to others."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience.  Always eating there when im craving food late at night. Chicken taco wednesday is my favorite day of the week!"}
{"text":"Food is always bad anytime someone brings this imitation mexican food to my house. Not only is it bad but order is wrong half the time and should come with a pack of tums cuz you will definitely have bubble guts."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 3 Stars The front of the restaurant looks like the rest of it, everything was completely cluttered. For the volume this place and being a chain resturant the amount of people this place sees on any given morning I am disappointed by the food storage and prep areas..  Hospitality: 4 stars The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Aside from being a snippy and trying to continently ask if \"That's It\" after each item my experience wasn't bad.  Food: 5 Stars The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.  Overall: This place is great for a \"quick\" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option."}
{"text":"Friendly, cheap, consistently good, open 24hrs - really can't ask for anything more. Countless drunken nights have ended here, and its great no matter what we order. Favs are nachos (beef or chicken), chicken taquitos, carne asada quesadilla, carnitas plate, carne asada chimichanga. One negative is their horchata - not as good as some other mex places. Tastes almost watered down.  I have gotten food poisoning from the one off Bermuda w the drive thru, but never this one."}
{"text":"Worst f*cking Roberto's I've ever been too. nothing but a bunch of unprofessional and unhappy workers that don't speak English. Food tastes like crap. Not real Mexican. They forget orders and the  $1 chicken tacos on Wednesday are rushed so they taste like sh*t. I'd give zero stars if I could"}
{"text":"Roberto's is usually pretty good no matter what location you visit. The location at Durango and elkorn was not so bueno.. no salsa bar, it's in a gas station. You can ask for red salsa, green salsa, pickled carrots but no green onions or horseradish. Whyyy? To top it off every table was filthy, no one was cleaning and the lady at the register definitely did not want to be there. I'll get the to go hot dog at the same gas station location next time."}
{"text":"Meh- the food is ok and the staff is ok- nothing special here for sure. With so many other choices for quick Mexican eateries this place is just not worth the heartburn- plus the overall seating area is really gross"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional, rude, barely speak & understand English. Much better food at Frijoles and Frescas."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican Spot!   But if you have allergies to shellfish aka shrimp - please be careful.   I Ate a steak chimichanga and ended in ER!   Cross contaminating food is a huge causality for allergy sufferers!!  I thought it would be okay.. but I got to be more careful!  But so do restaurants!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito 1 am ... hungry  a few drinks ... but  the burrito was just a alright I have better ones before different places someplace only one guy running the whole show what else do you need at that time of night I might come back close to my work and home"}
{"text":"You just can't ever go wrong with Robertos! Great food, always friendly employees. The portions are large, the daily specials are always a favorite if I can't make up my mind.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Early morning breakfast, we bump into a Mexican joint that serves breakfast 24/7.  I guess that's typical of Nevada to have crazy long hours.    Onto the food, we got the machaca burrito, that's shredded beef, onions, bell peppers, eggs and all wrapped in a large flour tortilla.  Temperature wise, this burrito is insanely scalding and for whatever reason holds the temperature for quite some time.  The more important details is the beef was tender, the amount of food is filling and all for just $4.  I've also had their machaca made with chicken and their regular chicken burrito.  They also have a salsa bar and their salsa verde pairs really well with the burritos.  This location also has a large outdoor patio area, which allowed us to enjoy the nice weather in November.  Coming from California, I really like this Mexican joint."}
{"text":"When it comes to quick, reasonably priced Mexican food that's open 24-hours, only Roberto's Taco shop comes to mind. There are quite a few locations all over town but this one happens to be the closest one to me. Some of my favorites include the California burrito, carne asada fries and breakfast burritos!  Good times for Roberto's.... or shall I say buenos tiempos!"}
{"text":"It's open 24 hours and serves ok mexican food. Not anything to write home about, but hits the spot when you are cruising late night for a meal. I find that there food is on the greasier side,  and usually my stomach can't handle that. They do have some specials during the week, that make cheap meals for the family. Prefer RIvas Mexican Grill which is around the corner."}
{"text":"For some reason, forgetting about the grease fill chicken taco and trip to the restroom late at night after eating this place, I LOVE IT!  The breakfast burrito is amazing. It's full of Cheese, Bacon, Eggs and Potatoes. Just how I like them!     I always get chicken tacos. Although I don't consider them authentic, I prefer them over many Mexican restaurants in this area. The staff at this Roberto's are very nice. Another plus is its located in a gas station, which makes it perfect for getting the perfect beverage to go with the food."}
{"text":"I had Robertos chicken tacos for dinner tonight.  Awesome.  You can't beat the Wednesday dollar chicken taco special.  Best deal in town."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Not authentic Mexican food! Breakfast burritos are the worst! Potatoes were hard and under cooked! Expensive! Ate there twice, but never again!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's but this one had a stale, unwelcoming and not too mention my bean and cheese burrito took a long time.  I ain't picky but when you see a dirty dining area, filthy is more accurate, and your food takes a long time and there is unease in the place someone is responsible for sharing.  That's me.  Sorry Roberto's, I am not abandoning you but this was disappointing."}
{"text":"A very good fast place to eat. You can even call in your order and pick it up. I recommend the California Burrito or the guacamole bean and cheese chips. They are both extremely good."}
{"text":"I have never had bad food from this location. It's clean, the staff is friendly, the food is stellar! Seriously, I don't go to any other location because they've set the bar so high, I'm usually disappointed if I go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was seriously bummed when we went to go grab our usual burritos and they were just bad. On our way home from church I called my order in, so we could just quickly grab and go since my husband had to leave for work. The order was simple, a CA burrito w/gauc, a carnita burrito, and a side of rice. I got home to find the burritos were half the size they usually were, the tortillas were dry, and the gauc I was charged for wasn't on the burrito. If my husband didn't need to leave to go to work I would have driven back over there, but there was no time. At least the rice was good! I guess I will be making the drive out to Aliante from now on."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time and I'm so disappointed that they raised the price of a breakfast burrito by a whole dollar.. The eggs were over cooked and tasted burnt, with small amounts of cheese and bacon . I guess I will be switching to fastos.."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican food I ordered the taco salad with carnitas so yummy and a bean and cheese burrito ...I know I'm a fatty lol. I like the refried beans here .craving mexican food come here inexpensive and good"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Nothing fancy. But then again, they don't claim to be.  Good Mexican food done quick. Can't go wrong. Good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Always fresh, friendly and tasty. Robertos is out go to favorite fir a quick, quality Mexican food.  We like this location because of the comfortable and clean dining room."}
{"text":"I was hungover & wanted something to soak up the liquor... I went with a beef wet burrito, ummmmh, ummmh, ummmh what a great choice... I'm stopping at this spot next time I come to Vegas (for sure)..."}
{"text":"A few cooks did a good job but this place was so poorly ran and the counter service so bad I was done with it.  Their salsa bar was always a disaster and a mess.  Then last week I noticed a \"New Management\" sign out front.  Stopped in and had terrific service, everything was clean and food great."}
