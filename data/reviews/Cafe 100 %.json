{"text":"Great atmosphere and very modern design in this restaurant! If you go make sure to try the Japanese pizza as well."}
{"text":"Food is overhyped and service is lacking. Good contemporary place to go for a change of environment. We went on a weeknight after 7:30pm there were only a few tables. Despite not being busy our server messed up a drink order and brought out our last dish after we reminded him that we had ordered it. Needs some strong improvement in service!"}
{"text":"I've been anticipating the day Cafe 100% opened for months now, slow drive bys at night to see how it's progressed. I've been to this place twice since it's opened and it has yet to disappoint me. The portion sizes are huge, the servers are young and eager to please (full of yummy recommendations), the decor reminds me of a chic steak house and the flavours just burst in your mouth. At first I was a bit weary seeing their large menu with a variety of Asian specialty dishes - but we have tried a lot of menu items and each one has impressed us. Even the drink menu offers some amazing and unique items. I'm so glad this place opened as his area is lacking in the quality foodie places."}
{"text":"I frequent this place for its convenient late hours (until 1am on Friday and Saturday, and until midnight every other day of the week).  It's a great place to stop by and have a small portion of something warm to end a long day at work or in town.  The place oozes modern d√©cor and is generally cozy and calm--not quite as hectic as its almost-neighbouring T-Pot, but it can get busy for the lunch service.  At this point, I'm mostly familiar with the late-night service.  Past 9pm, their regular menu changes over to the evening tapas menu (there's also the drink menu), which has choices that are perfect for a bit of comfort food--this includes anything from noodles (wonton, spam and egg, etc.), to wings, to even poutine. I'd like to add that the staff are very friendly and accomodating--in truth I've had a few issues with wrong orders and wait times, but each time the staff were quick to remedy the issue.  In fact a few dishes I've ordered at lunch/dinner have changed over my many visits in terms of taste or sauces, so I think they're still experimenting a bit with the menu.  Lastly, the prices are a bit much in my personal opinion--tapas could be a bit cheaper and some item portions could be bigger, but again, if you're in for some late night eats, this place will not disappoint a weary soul at 11 in the evening."}
{"text":"Awesome hk style food and more . Clean modern trendy place with well prepared and very tasty food . Service is also friendly and fast !  No pics cause food looked too good not to dig in right away"}
{"text":"Went to get a little snack with my two cousins. When you first walk in you are welcomed with some nice decor that gives a cozy feeling to the restaurant.  For my self I got the ramen and the matcha red bean smoothie w/ pearls. As for my cousins they both got the honey syrup toast, the strawberry slush and the taro slush w/ pearls.  For the ramen, the noodles the broth was pretty flavourful but it wasn't nothing out of the ordinary, and the noodles were cooked to the point where they were soft but chewy ( just the way I like it ^.^).   For the Honey Toast it came with the side of ice cream and whipped cream. Personally when I saw it it looked way to sweet... And it was *.*, the toast was just drenched in this honey syrup that made it kind of hard to eat because it was so sweet.  For the drinks the strawberry slush was so-so, it wasn't to sweet and it wasn't to bland ( I would get thus again next time ^_^). For the matcha red bean smoothie it was again so-so, I expected the colour to be like a green with little pieces if red beans in it.. It wasnt , the colour was this kind if purple. And for the taro slush... ABSOLUTELY GARAGE, from looking at it, it seems it would taste okay... But no, there was no taste to the drink what's so ever, basically it just tasted like water, I wouldn't recommended this if you come here.  Overall, the service was great and the food was okay, I might come back one day but for sure I will not get the taro slush."}
{"text":"very creative food menu and drink menu.   I tried the chilled milk tea which is nice to have a drink which is not with ice but is cold. The spicy XO sauce fried orzo taste great.   My friend had the daily special and she likes the minced meat with chicken. She tried the drink with tofu and coconut milk, she loves it so much that she almost want to order another one.   We then share the Skewer Trio without lamb, we like them and the dish reminds us on the skewer we tried when we are in Malaysia. I sure hope they will serve pineapple with the skewer tho.   Anyways, we love the restaurant atmosphere and staff wasn't that bad as some other reviews. We will sure go back to the place and try many other dishes that we can't find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nothing like this in this area. Great HK and Taiwanese styled food, not 100% authentic.   Still nice to have a restaurant that is original in the area.    Music was all Mandarin.  Interior art is all photos of Hong Kong.    Wasn't impressed with Taiwanese popcorn chicken add on for lunch menu. Everything else was on point.    Really look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"The food, well some of it is pretty good. Nothing out of this world. We've been here a few times and it's just been okay because the thing that hurts this place is the service and like most places. My wife and I were sat down and as soon as that happened the servers sat down and decided to neglect the other tables and us, and eat. I understand you need breaks and all, but you're running a business. Don't work in the service industry if you refuse to cater to your customers.    I won't go out of my way to come here anymore unless I have too. T-pot across the street has better service than here and that's not saying a whole lot.  Gotta say though they're good at picking up and clearing the tables, at least.   If you want okay food and really ineffective service, then have at it!"}
{"text":"My parents are creatures of habit, they stick to what they know and love. So when they suggested this \"new place\" to try, I was like \"Ok, it's gotta be good\"  It doesn't look like the typical (read:crowded and loud) Chinese restaurants we usually frequent. It's rustic and modern looking.  We were on a noodle frenzy that night: fried bean sprout noodles, scallop and shrimp udon and seafood cream sauce fried noodles  Ok, not only were the the seafood noodles tasty, they were visually appealing. A tower of fried noodles topped with seafood on a piping hot skillet comes out and then the server pours the cream sauce over it all and a sizzling aroma lures you in.   I really like it here, and I'm so glad my parents introduced us to this place, it'll be a staple for us for sure."}
{"text":"1st the caveats: I have only tried Cafe 100% once and I got the food to go, so I haven't sampled the dishes at their best.  My order: I got 3 dishes for 2 people to go knowing it's probably more food than we could eat in one meal, which turned out to be correct. Value in terms of proportion to cost: decent/pretty good. I had the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, the smoked salmon and oyster rice pizza, and the much loved on Instagram: oven baked ham and chicken spaghetti.  My final verdict: meh! It looks way better than it tastes, meaning: it looks pretty amazing but only tastes average. Not worth a detour but it will fill you up if you do decide to go. You can get some nice Instagram pics here if that's any consolation! ;p  On takeout: I had to wait quite a while! Not sure if it's the pasta baking or just a slow service day but all the food came out hot, so no harm done. The packaging was standard and neat, got a load of napkins, individual chopsticks and plastic spoons. The dishes held up pretty well in transit. It was a short trip but nothing fell apart or leaked or got soggy etc. Good job on the takeaway!  The popcorn chicken: This was the best! Mainly because the salty spice mix covering the deep fried chicken was pretty tasty. The chicken itself was kinda dry but certainly edible. Not bad.  The smoked salmon and oyster rice pizza: It is on a crust so you can pick up the slices and eat it like a pizza. Points for a creative dish but the flavour didn't live up to the idea. Presentation is top notch with this one. Zigzag drizzled mayo and okonomiyaki sauce (that's what it tasted like anyway), bonito flakes on top, and a pop of colour with the green onion. This looks really good! Flavour wise... not sure if there were supposed to be any actual oysters in the rice, or just a lightly oyster sauced rice. Either way the oyster part was completely lost in the dish. The rice was fine and the salmon was visible and tasted ok but overall for a sauce covered pizza this was pretty bland and flavourless! Rather disappointing! The Unagi rice pizza is the Instagram favourite (yes I do pick some of what I eat because of Instagram,) so I'll try that one next time. I'm sceptical if it'll be much better but it's always worth a try.  Finally the baked pasta: I rather liked the chicken in this! The meat itself was better than the popcorn chicken, it wasn't dry and had decent flavour, but the rest was again bland. This reminds me a lot of boiled plain pasta coated in butter and seasoned with cracked black pepper! You know, those lazy, late night bowls; or for some, that much treasure childhood favourite!? Anyway, all the baked spaghetti was missing was the black pepper! (So it got half way to amazing.) For a baked pasta dish covered in cheese, stuffed with a decent share of ham and chicken and a few mushrooms, how did it turn out only ok?! There's only a creaminess but none of the chicken, ham, mushroom or even any real cheese flavour made it into/onto the sauce and noodles! Even if you get a bit of everything in the same bite it's still only meh! How can this not turn out amazing!? It's stacked with craveable ingredients but hey, you really are better off making butter and pepper pasta at home!  Again, Overall: Meh! (???) It's good enough to eat, the cost is fair, but the taste is nothing special. Even some of their more creative dishes fall flat on flavour. If you're in the area and the shawarma place across the parking lot is closed or too busy, go ahead and eat here! It's not bad but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Calgary food scene. The food is HK fusion, so while it's not \"authentic\" I love the contemporary twist in the dishes. Some of the dishes can be hit or miss depending on your preference. I highly recommend trying their drinks. Ambiance is great as well."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to go to HK cafe, however, it was incredibly busy, so we decided to go across the street to Cafe100%. The food was decent and I thought the portions were good, however, it is more expensive than HK cafe. The presentation and atmosphere is lovely and very modern. Service started out very nice but, after we paid cash and left it on the table, one of the servers ran to us in the parking lot and insisted that we paid with \"fake cash.\" The $10 we paid was made in the 1980's and is old.  We tried to tell him that the bill has little marks like any other paper bill and we told him that there is a certain texture to the bill that makes it real, however, he still insisted for us to give him another $10 bill. I'm not the one to argue, so I gave him another bill. After, we went to the bank to check if it was real, and it was. After that experience, I will not come back again. Even if the HK cafe is busy again, I will just wait for a table rather than coming here."}
{"text":"This plaz wil guarantee u with a smile on ur face n a desiree to come bak for more. The menu s so fun n the food is just tasty n decently priced.  Little bit fusion but distinct on its own. Gotta go bak to this place again."}
{"text":"Food here is unique and different! Which I love! It is a fusion of both Cantonese food and japanese food. The service here is alright. Could be better but it's probably better than most service around this area. But since I am from the states. The service is terrible compared to what we get. Also their is only one restroom for each gender. Parking is also limited here.   Service : 3/5 Food : 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5"}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great.  Had the seafood tower with cream sauce.  So disappointed.  Cream sauce tasted like cream of mushroom soup. I was looking for a more authentic garlic cream sauce."}
{"text":"630pm Before flight to Yellowknife. Korean BBQ chicken, lemon grass pork, spicy salmon spaghetti, napoleon pork. With soup and tea, for roughly 15 bucks. it's an awesome experience"}
{"text":"Food at this place is amazing, I've come here a whole bunch of times and have always come home with a happy stomach.  The issue is the service. Every time I dine here the service is lacking, whether it be a long wait to get our order down or just waiting 30 minutes to get the food. My last experience there was the worst. The waiter took our order, 30 minutes go by and the food hasn't arrived. I ask the waiter to please check our order and they completely forgot to plug it into the system so our order was never even recorded. We had to reorder and wait another 10 minutes to finally get our food. As usual the food was amazing, but this does not take away from the fact that the service was quite frankly terrible. They were very apologetic which was great to see, but they did not offer any sort of discount or coupon to try to entice us to come back. Other restaurants of the same caliber would've given us at least a discount for their mistakes. Apologies can only go so far, because at the end of the day I paid the same price as everyone else for the same great food but for terrible service.   Cafe 100% is a great place, but they need to improve their service significantly for me to recommend this place to my friends or family."}
{"text":"Waited outside for place to open, at 11am guy opened the door, looked at us, grabbed the flyers off the ground and closed the door on my wife and 7 year old. There is double doors, didn't hold the second door for us, when we went in, he didn't greet us, just grabbed the menus and flagged us to follow. Dropped the menus on a table and walked away. Very rude, and we left without ordering."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 4 if their service was better. First of all, everything is priced just right (I want to say it's cheaper than a lot of fusion restaurants I've been to, but I'll give it a huge thumbs up for the price and the portions). Parking is limited. The ambience is nice for dates and group hang outs. The layout is great, clean, aesthetically pleasing. Food is good- I've tried their calamari, carbonara, Taiwanese chicken, ramen, escargot pasta- very good fusion food. As for the service, for the few times I've been here, I didn't feel quality serving. They take the order as if they're rushing (and yes, it gets busy, I understand). Not once did they come around to ask if food was okay or we needed anything, and while it's understandable because of the busyness, it threw me and my friends off a bit because we called for help and had to ask another server because ours didn't end up coming around. I mean, at least come by to the table when we wave for your help within a 5-10 minute span. Would still recommend this place though."}
{"text":"Interesting New Asian Fusion Restaurant. Very nice decor, comfy ambient. Good services but foods preparation were quite slow. Foods are good to great. Good portion. Very tasty. 2nd time back. Would recommend people to try."}
{"text":"The food is good and so is the decor of the restaurant.  With everything being new, the staff seems to be a bit disorganized.  The service is good when the place is quiet but as soon as the place fills up to half full, service goes down the drain.  They do have enough waiting staff in my view but somehow things are not getting done including servicing the patrons.  It's like they totally forgotten about us.  It is unfortunately since I would have given this place a solid 4-star if not for the service."}
{"text":"I like the uniqueness and varieties of this place .  Very Clean and nice decoration.  Food was served quickly.  Friendly Staffs.  Food was served warm and fresh. I have been there twice and both times were happy with my order.   Their Smoked salmon pasta is really good and has nice smokey flavor"}
{"text":"My favorite HK food in Calgary so far! Trumps even the other restaurants by the same owner. The food is simple, good portions and it's tasty.   I would recommend the chilled milk tea. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good but service is lacking. I've come here numerous times and every time one of our tables order was late. Even after asking for them to follow up on the orders they come late. They are also forgetful when you ask for extras like a cup of water or a bowl of rice."}
{"text":"They would not substitute rice for vegetables to facilitate my diabetes. Very poor consideration for their customers."}
{"text":"Looking for simple and cheaper alternative in the NW NE area? Look no further. Cafe 100% has pretty decent tasting early or late lunch for a budgeted price. Their beef noodle soup is not authentic, more like soy sauce soup. Their general lunch menu, although on the cheaper side, are really good portioned. If ordering western food, ie pasta, expect super Asian style unauthentic sauces noodles. However, if one orders more HK style food, it tastes great. The lunch menu also comes with soup and a drink!!!! Good deal overall!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Cafe 100% because it's quick, delicious and reasonably priced. An average meal costs about $15-20 but you can get a filling dish for $2-3 less at Cafe 100%.  I've tried a lot of dishes at Cafe 100% and you can go wrong with any of them. One dish that stands out is their Hainanese chicken with includes a huge bowl of soup, veg on the side, rice and deboned moist chicken.  Their soup noodles don't come in huge portions which is the only disappointing thing I can think of. The staff is young and don't go above and beyond for their tips, but they're better than most Chinese restaurants.  Cafe 100% will become your quick go-to for comforting, authentic Chinese food if you're in the north and the best part is it won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Good cross section of fusion asian dishes. i have not been disappointed with the menu"}
{"text":"The drinks are probably better than the food, but the food is actually not too bad at all. My favourite is the super chilled milk tea. It is super strong and not diluted at all. The lemon iced tea is also a very good choice. I tried the chicken curry with nhan bread and enjoyed it. The Singapore noodles are a little bland, but if you add their XO sauce it tastes great! The desserts are also quite yummy. It's more of a Hong Kong fusion place so don't expect it to be 100% authentic. The service is actually good for a Hong Kong Cafe so I tip the normal amount (not 10% like at other Hong Kong cafes with horrible service where the servers purposely ignore your waves.)"}
{"text":"Great casual chinese restaurant.  Same owners as Sun's BBQ, T Pot and Calgary Court.  The sichuan peanut noodle soup is my favourite."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  There's something comforting about Cafe 100% and reminds me of some of the HK cafes that we have back in Vancouver.  Great decor, open space and fast service and not surprisingly, it is also owned by the same people who operate Calgary Court, Sun's BBQ, Forbidden City etc.  My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon and Oyster Rice Pizza.  We first had this during YYC Pizza Week (thank you Dale E. for the gift card) and it was unique, but pretty tasty.   Great addition to the food scene here in Calgary."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good, and the late menu is aweome for late dinners with a great price. The environment is very comfortable and modern, servers are kind, and great Hong Kong style food."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Menu is a mix of Asian food (e.g. Pho,  curry with roti,  etc....).  If you know this going in then you won't be surprised.  Many tables ordered the chow mein which is served on a hotplate with the sauce poured on top and creates a sizzling presentation.  I will have to try this next time :)"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was the nice decor.  Sat very comfortably with a nice view out the back of the restaurant.  Prices were okay and the food was good for Calgary standards.  Service was speedy and friendly.  I've heard many of my Calgary friends say there's no decent place to eat around here but I would come back here."}
{"text":"I eat here more than I'll admit. The food is consistent and of decent value.  They have neat items on the menu such as the fried noodles with mushroom sauce and basic dishes such as tomato/beef on rice.   Food prep time can be hit or miss. Servers are generally good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for the price and the portions you get is hands down worth it. As a university student this place has it all for a decently priced meal and drinks. It's like fast food hk fusion food if that makes sense? So it doesn't have that original Chinese flavour food if that's what you're looking for. However, If you're looking for a large variety of food with fusion spin offs this is the place. The food also comes out fast and they are very consistent Would recommend this joint to anyone"}
{"text":"Decided to pop into Caf√© 100% after a visit to T&T.  The restaurant is on the dark side with booths, half booths and tables.  The wait staff speaks in English and Chinese.  The menus are chockfull of different Asian and Asian fusion items.  We ordered the following: - Hainan Chicken Rice - comes on a big tray with the Hainan boneless chicken chopped up in nice clean pieces, the rice bowl (not the oily rice that is always associated with Hainan Rice), daily soup, lettuce with oyster sauce, chili sauce and sweet soya sauce.  The chicken tasted good.  The rice is so-so.  The soup & vege was ok.  2 people at the table loved it. - Chiu Chow Congee - Delicious comfort soup makes me remember of Singapore!  A hit with my dad! - Fried XO Turnip Cake with sweet soya sauce - nice appy!  Also memories of Singapore comes back! - Fried Seafood Noodle w Cream Sauce on a hot plate - what an entrance!  Sizzling away with shrimp, squid and scallop.  The noodles were deep-fried in the shape of a brick and then the cream sauce was poured in front of you on a hot plate.  Loved it!  Yes, we will be back!"}
