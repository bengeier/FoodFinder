{"text":"Shared the veggie sandwich and capris sandwich with my husband. Both were excellent. Also had the chicken chilly---that was my favorite along with a cappuccino with coconut sugar. The atmosphere was modern and inviting and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely being going back."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Seattle and looking for a place to eat breakfast on a week day. This place was rated so well that we drove 30 minutes from our hotel to come here and we're not disappointed. The four of us all had different coffees (all good) and some breakfast sandwiches and an amazing pulled pork hash. Everyone we talked to was relaxed and nice, absolutely amazing service! 

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by while running errands.  Got the roasted beet salad and the Rueben panini.  Both were excellent.  will stop by in the future for breakfast - the menu looked promising."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great! Small menu but it's super good. And they have coconut sugar, which is neat, I guess?"}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance of Tangerine Cafe are absolutely amazing!! I eat here at least once a week, if not more! I highly recommend this restaurant to all. The veggie hash is delish :)"}
{"text":"Order the iced black coffee every time I go and it's always great ! Have ordered multiple food choices and they have all been super fresh and delicious. Ordered the corn beef hash today, very hearty and filling after a night of drinking. . Love this place :)"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place it would be six out of five stars, tapped that \"like\" button twice, they provide delicious, fresh food and focus on Quality service, coffee is fresh and hot perfect for these cold days, very welcoming environment with unique pallet decor, felt right at home, highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after running errands.  Closest vegan item on the menu is the insipid and very very very boring veggie sandwich \"hold the cheese please\".  No thanks.  I had a cup of coffee and left."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! I came in to spend some time working on my computer and have some coffee. The staff was attentive and the coffee was good. The internet was fast and I was able to get a lot done. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio to enjoy breakfast or lunch. Enjoying a afternoon cappuccino. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"First off, the staff is super friendly and helpful. But, I would rather have someone be rude to me and have a phenomenal espresso. :( :( :( Not the case here horrible pod coffee I hate  pod coffee:( I've been to many coffee shops around the globe and had many types of coffee. This place is ok for someone that doesn't know any better a bit redundant a dime a dozen. They use Hersey syrup and powders for their frappes. Nothing phenomenal here."}
{"text":"They have a great rich bold espresso. Their golden beet salad with goat cheese was so good. Their passion iced tea is great!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe just outside of anthem. Wife and I stopped in for a quick breakfast the other day.

Paninis were fresh and hot, service was fast, vibe was relaxed. This would be a good place to post up and get some work done for me. If you want a quick coffee shop breakfast that isn't Starbucks pre-made, this is it."}
{"text":"I was getting my car washed and noticed this cafe right across from it by far the best cafe I've tasted since being back home!!!!! Very clean and very friendly people!!!! Food is AMAZINGGGGG!!!!!! I had the Chorizo turkey hash brown I think that's what I had and it was BOMB!!! Thx again!!!"}
{"text":"What a great find! This coffee shop is just what I'm looking for! They use First class beans from Lavazza (Italian) and the food options are definitely a bonus!. You can't find that at Sbucks where they have burnt tasting coffee and microwaveable sandwiches. At this joint, you can tell that everything is made fresh! A must try: I had the Buffalo chicken wrap (add the feta cheese as recommended as it is not included in the ingredients). My girlfriend had the Caesar salad! And wow! The dressing with shaved Parmesan is incredible! 

The vibe of the cafe is very chill! Feels like you're home, clean environment and comfy seating options. They have a couch and that's where we sat. Modern, rustic and original. 

The staff is incredible! They really look like they love their job because it shows on how they take care of customer. You can hardly see that nowadays. 

Although it is located on a busy Eastern and Sunridge Heights cross road, it was kinda hidden. More of a Truly a hidden gem! Look for Massage Envy as a landmark and turn in! 

We saw a lot of people just walk in for coffee and now this is my go to place for sure!"}
{"text":"Good cappuccino! My only disappointment is that they don't have real cups, only paper."}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant tangerine is off the charts. Food is fantastic. Freshest coffee in this town.  Star buckis not even close to the quality of this coffee serve breakfast lunch salads wraps. Probably the most reasonable prices in Henderson and maybe even Las Vegas. Today I had their Italian roast coffee. Since I drink my coffee totally black I enjoy a good cup of coffee. All Anthem residents really need to check this place out. I loved the jerk chicken wrap and the chicken chili Verde soup. Jerk chicken made me think I was in Jamaica again"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast and coffee. Staff very friendly and gave me a great recommendation for meal since it was my first time here. Had the chorizo turkey hash. Nice blend of veggies covers with egg white omelette and a very light hollandaise sauce. Wife had veggie hash which was a 5 as well."}
{"text":"I'm going to base my rating on not just the food, but the experience as a whole. For the food... 5 stars. I came in for a quick bite between dropping off my son at preschool and a dr appt. I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich. It was great. Nice crispy bacon, not the precooked stuff. The cholula I added to it made it even better. 
My issue comes when I ordered my drink. I ordered an iced mocha... To which the person who took my order looked at me and replied \"But you're pregnant!\" Yes, yes I am. \"And you're drinking caffeine?!?!\" Again, yes, yes I am. I found myself defending my choice to consume caffeine while pregnant. This is my third child. I enjoy coffee in the mornings because I need the energy to survive my other 2 early birds. I told her I've always had happy, sleeping babies. But, it didn't stop there. I ordered a large iced mocha, which apparently comes with 3 shots of espresso. She asked if I wanted all 3 shots. I told her I wanted it however it is usually made. She replied \"okay... If you say so.\" Had I requested a line of cocaine or an 8-ball, I could see someone giving me grief, but caffeine? Give me a break. I have one a day and I make it count by getting a large. 
In a world where people are constantly giving unsolicited advice, please stick to what you are good at: food and drinks and stray from off handed, albeit well intended, advice."}
{"text":"Great food!! Everybody needs to tray this homemade corned beef hash. And the service is great too."}
{"text":"Yum! I had the Reuben panini on wheat bread and my husband had the Chorizo wrap. Cool atmosphere, too. I wanted to try the green tea frappe but it's a little too chilly outside right now"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here through bite squad and the only thing that was good was the Greek salad, which was kind of amazing.. but the turkey spinach wrap tasted like feet and the eggs in the bagel were so dry and gross :( also the brownie (the one thing I was looking forward to) was the detest brownie I've ever had in my life. I was very disappointed with my experience in this place"}
{"text":"Tangerine cafe is an amazing place to grab a yummy, fresh and nutritious meal. There is a lot of love in this family owned establishment. The warmth, the quality and the pride in their menu resonates in the yummy taste of each bite. What an awesome spot! Glad you are in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has 4.5 stars... I'm pretty easy to please- and was not happy with my experience. I ordered the Thai chicken wrap and a small fruit plate. Total came to $15, and the wrap was pretty small, and included a very small portion of cucumbers. I ate my wrap, although it didn't taste very good- and in my last few bites, I pulled out a large piece of plastic (from either a glove or plastic wrap, not too sure) I let one of the workers know, and she showed the chef, and he said \"sorry\" 

I know sometimes that stuff happens, but at least try to make up for it. Should have been offered something... anything (other than just an apology) The fruit plate was good, but it's kinda hard not to get that right. I will not be returning to this spot unfortunately."}
{"text":"Nice little place out of the field of view.  Family run place obviously.  Had the meatball sub.  Meatballs were great...however it doesn't appear they have an oven or broiler because the cheese was obviously melted using a microwave.  Has to be melted by being broiled guys.  Anyway real friendly service and the half sandwich half soup special was good.  It was actually chili instead of soup.  Highlight of the entire table."}
{"text":"Just left the Tangerine Cafe and Expresso bar.  It is an amazing place that you must check out. Great coffee and food. Wonderful atmosphere and the service is nice. Would you believe that they have ALMOND milk? I was sooooo excited to order a latte with almond milk. All other places would only have soy or whole milk.  This is my new spot. So stop by and enjoy. See you there!!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is homemade which gives it a star. The menu is intriguing so I was a little torn on what to get (something I love because then the odds of regretting your choice are reduced). I really enjoyed the girl behind the bar, she was very sweet and informative. 

They had a fun assortment of different espresso drinks. I love that. Because it was different I chose their orange mocha latte, iced. It was a 4/5. The mocha was a little grainy- a feature I like. The orange wasn't too much, but just enough. I wouldn't get it again but I am glad I tried it. 

For food- I chose their Turkey Chorizo Hash because I read about it being amazing on Yelp.  I liked the flavor initially, but then it got a little too repetitive. I would have preferred more hollandaise sauce because the chorizo and potato ratio made my mouth dry. I also would have liked more onions in the hash. Bc of my dry mouth and need for a change in flavor, I really wanted ketchup or something but the person I came with was mid conversation and it seemed rude to get up for a condiment (they have a table to gather all your condiments and silverware. It was cute until it was inconvenient). By the time it was appropriate for me to get my condiment game going, all the stuff I wanted had been taken from the table to a guest's table. What a flop. 

So I downed my drink in between bites and I guess that was that. 

Their brownies are homemade and huge and delicious. The crust was amazing. Kudos on the yummy brownie. 

Perhaps if I visit again I will like the new pick better but I didn't much care for the overall flavor on this go."}
{"text":"Only had coffee because I accidentally found this place. But the coffee and ambiance / music & staff were perfect. 

Not sure how long this has been here. It was slow. Quiet. And because it's out of the way (behind everything) and hard to find (where's the signage)?, I thought I'd Yelp it now in hopes of shouting out to others .... 
Come here. Come here. 

Best part. It's authentic. Unique and not corporate. 

And we'll be back."}
{"text":"I liked the relaxed atmosphere, and food at tangerine. The Ruben was excellent and very filling as well. I will be back."}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday.  I was looking for new breakfast places to go to, and this was one of the highest rated, plus it was near where I had to run my errands yesterday.

If you weren't looking for it, you might miss it.  Located off of Eastern on the way to Anthem, it's in a tucked away corner of one of the office plazas, but trust me, it's worth finding.

Atmosphere is very chill and relaxed.  They play comforting music, and the staff is friendly.  There are seating areas inside and out, but with the weather in the high 70s we chose outside.

I went with a breakfast pulled pork wrap, with scrambled eggs, avocado, salsa verde, and Monterey jack cheese.  It was delicious, and it comes with a little fruit bowl too.  The menu looks great, I can't wait to go back for more breakfast and lunch options.  

Place seems healthy; they offer healthier snack options than your usual café/sandwich shop.

For sure, I'm going back."}
{"text":"Small, quaint, local business. Not a sit down restaurant, you order at restaurant and they bring it to you. Their credit card machine was down, so it took a while to get through the line, but they were apologetic for it. I ordered my food to-go, I ordered the Smoked Salmon plate and the Spinach& Mozzarella wrap, along with a vanilla frappe and an iced chai tea latte. 

The smoked salmon plate came with an everything bagel, 4 square slices of lox, along with a slice of cream cheese, onions and cappers. It was delicious, and tasted fresh. The only thing I would suggest is to add more than one slice of cream cheese, because I felt even when I used all of it, it was still dry and not enough. Overall 5/5 $9.95

The Spinach and Mozzarella wrap was for my mom, they happily substituted a panini bread for a spinach wrap. It is exactly what it says it is, there is only cheese and spinach in the wrap. No sauces, other veggies, egg, etc. It does come with a small side of fruit which was nice. Overall 5/5 $4.95

The vanilla frappe was delicious! Put starbucks to shame for sure. It doesn't normally come with caffeine or coffee in it, but they were able to add it if you ask. I felt it was a little too sweet for my taste, but my mom loved it!! Overall 4/5 $3.45

The chai tea latte to me was immaculate. I usually go for the oprah chai at starbucks, but this had less spice and more chai taste to it, which was nice. Get it iced, it is so yummy! Overall 5/5 $3.25

While I was there a homeless lady strolled in, with a dollar in her hand. She asked for coffee (more than a dollar), and the gentleman up at the front gave her a cup of iced coffee at no charge, which I thought was awesome. Another reason I love local businesses. I ended up siting and talking to this lady while I was waiting for my order, and she says that she knows the workers from this location and their other one, and they have always been so friendly and welcoming to her. Awesome customer service!

They also offer 15% off any purchase, student/teacher discounts M-F 7-9am and 2-5pm with valid student id AND keep your receipts because at the bottom, there is a 25% off coupon good for the next couple of days after your purchase!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on a whim and we loved it. Had live music playing that day. The food was all pretty good and was a nice little place to hang out. That is, until after we finished our meal and looked up to see a huge cockroach in the light above us. Will not be eating there again until it's cleaned up."}
{"text":"Good food, extremely nice and helpful servers, and a comfortable environment. The double chocolate frappe was delicious! And my sausage and egg white panini was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I came in and asked what the most popular item was and was recommended the Reuben. I ordered it and for got that o had come in with the intention of eating something healthier than a Reuben. 

I was not disappointed. It was definitely one of the better Reuben's I've had in Vegas. I also appreciate the fact that it did not weight ten pounds. Perfect lunch time healthy snack. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"In an area packed with quality breakfast spots, Tangerine Cafe flies under the radar. It doesn't help that their storefront and signage are mostly limited to the backside of the building, but once you've find it, you'll likely be back. After about 8AM, the dining room and patio were flooded with regulars. 

They serve Lavazza coffee, and it's still delicious and smooth even if you order it iced or as a cold brew. Their breakfast menu is limited but so is their space. The turkey-chorizo sandwich uses a flavorful but virtually greaseless patty to make a relatively healthy meal after a nearby run or bike ride. Grab the sriracha if you want a bit more heat, or a truffle from the pastry case if you want something sweet."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere and has good pastries and small dishes.  If you want a cappuccino, you might need to explain how it differs from a latte, but that's the case at most coffee shops. I've been several times, the staff has always been helpful (especially when I've gone in larger groups) and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Reuben sandwich: stringy, tough dried out corned beef and very little sauerkraut. My wife ate half, the remainder went in the trash can at the restaurant. The Caprese panini was edible, but the cheese was not even melted. Half of it joined the Reuben in the trash. The black tea lemonade was OK.

The metal chairs are uncomfortable, and if you are on the chubby side, you may not fit in them. Thankfully we are of normal size, but they were still marginal. 

I predict this business will not be around at the end of the year."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Quality product. Pastries are very good, too.  Great flaky crust!

Met the owner, who was working behind the counter, yesterday.  He was a very nice
man, and with a knack for customer service. 

Location is off the Main Street, Eastern, but well worth the find. 

If you want real Italian coffee, or a REAL macchiato, and not coffee for the masses (cheap coffee over roasted for flavor), you'll love it here."}
{"text":"This became my go to coffee shop when I tried them a couple months ago. They are the only place I can find that makes the mocha with the proper chocolate, ghirardelli! I would have given 5 stars except for a couple issues. First is the fact that their drinks taste different each time, whether it's the amount of chocolate or the roast of the espresso. It's never the same and it can be hit or miss. The breakfast wraps are very good though. 

I also had to drop my rating to 3 stars because I stopped by this morning at 7:15, 15 minutes after their posted opening time both online and on the door and the store was flat closed. Lights off and no one around. Very frustrating considering I have to drive 10 to 15 minutes out of the way in the opposite direction of my office to get there. Very unprofessional. Probably won't be coming back since I am moving to another side of town soon."}
{"text":"A few things, it's hidden from the street and hidden in the back of the shopping center. The menu is limited so don't come here hungry. I can't put my finger on it but it's missing something. Music? People? Better design? I don't know. I did enjoy my drink the Candy Crush but nothing that I can't get at Sbux or anywhere else that serve peppermint pumps for your drink. I wanted to have a pastry with my drink but the pastries look store bought, the pastry case itself was poorly displayed. 

I won't be back. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"This is a prefect to sit back and relax with a great cup of coffee, but I highly recommend you try a bit  to eat!!! Everyone that works here is so friendly."}
{"text":"Had the chorizo turkey wrap and it was delicious. Ice coffee was also delicious and free refills, so...

Place is super cute, albeit sparse on design and the pastry selection was a bit small, but the food and coffee was delicious and the price was fair!

Will def go back."}
{"text":"We couldn't find anything that sounded good to eat. The combinations of food in their entrees were pretty bizarre. The place seemed small and had an odd vibe. The employees were really nice and willing to help! Parking was pretty bad, had to walk a bit. We probably won't go back, sorry."}
{"text":"Very hidden little gem. Food is very fresh, fast and healthy and service is very friendly. 
Had the veggie wrap it was thick and delicious. Kids had a brownie and a cookie and it was decadent and perfect"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Yummy food. Delicious drinks. 

We came on their grand opening and it's nice to see a steady stream of patrons already visiting this new spot. 

So far the husband and I have had the Reuben panini and the chorizo breakfast panini. Both good choices. 

We also had a caramel mocha frappe with soy milk and a passion fruit black tea (free refills on the tea - SCORE!) 

Free wifi. Lots of seating.

Can't wait to try more! We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best places around the area to chill with family and friends. They have great food and coffee! Their homemade corned beef and hash is a must try! It's one of their best sellers! The wraps and paninis are also very good! We also tried one of their new drinks which is the peanut butter and jelly coffee, it is very innovative and surprisingly good!  

The staff are very friendly with excellent customer service! They know the menu very well so you can always ask them whatever."}
{"text":"5 star all the way, food is awesome!! Customer service is awesome!! Great place to stop and get some healthy food!! Turkey Corizo Panini is bomb!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and I enjoyed an iced tea lemonade and Italian panini today. The tea is passion fruit flavored, so my drink was really refreshing on a hot summer day. The panini had great flavors and was very tasty! Even though I don't live in the area, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a quick lunch with the husband. We had the turkey chorizo hash, buffalo sandwich & a turkey verde chili. The sandwich and soup were both good, but the hash was the star of the show. Fantastic. Potatoes were cooked perfectly, everything was seasoned nicely and there was the perfect ratio of all ingredients. 

As a bonus the workers here were incredibly friendly and its obvious they take real pride in their food and customer service. 

Only negative thing is the metal chairs are kind of small and not super comfortable."}
{"text":"Try posting on your website or leaving a message on your answering machine if you're closing for a holiday.  I could not find any info, and when I showed up, your sign even said \"open\".  But you were not open.  Major fail."}
{"text":"Verdict: Fantastic food, but possible bad drink choice makes for an almost perfect Yelp score. 

I wanted so bad to like this place more than I did when we left, but I was left with a feeling like I was missing something... caffeine. 

Now I may have just made a bad drink choice, but I swear the last time I had a blended mocha, it had coffee AND chocolate. Not straight up chocolate. I could have swore I was drinking Nesquik!

The food was so good, that I would give them 5-stars on that alone. I had the turkey chorizo hash and my boo had the turkey panini. The hash dish was brightly seasoned and full of great flavors--fried egg whites, crispy nuggets of turkey chorizo and perfectly cooked slices of potatoes. The panini had soft, chewy bread with a toasty exterior that gently hugged a perfectly cooked egg white, jack cheese, bold cilantro and a generous slab of their turkey patty. 

Quick tip: Next time, I've gotta get some me some espresso-type drink and hopefully be able to tack on that last star for a perfect score."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE cafe in Vegas. I end up here a couple of times a week for iced coffees and their breakfast paninis. Wonderful and attentive staff and great food and coffee. Plus with either indoor or outdoor seating you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic cafe! It's a little hidden in the Lee's Discount Liquor and 7 Hills Carwash area, but it's absolutely worth while. Great staff, friendly service, as well as an extensive menu. 
I've had only a few food items from the Tangerine but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and flavor of the food.

The prices are very reasonable, a cold-brew coffee for barely $2 (16oz). The coffee was flavorful, bold, and didn't taste watered down like some places (cough* Starbucks cough*).
As a person who worked in food service, the low prices make me willing to tip and I always feel welcomed. It's going to be my new hangout place for studying or grabbing a quick breakfast when I'm running late.

Keep up the great work! Love your food, your coffee, and your staff!"}
{"text":"I love coffee and everything about it, so when I see local coffee shops, I MUST GO! I didn't try any of their coffee, only because it was 430p when I went in and I must try to sleep, but everything about this cute, awesome coffee shop was beyond amazing! I had a strawberry pineapple smoothie, and it's the best smoothie I ever had, great customer service, I recommend this place to anyone, I wish it wasn't so hidden, so everyone could see it, but I will be back to taste their coffee!  Come try this place! I hope for a wonderful success!"}
{"text":"Walking distance boner...

What does that mean? In Vegas the chances of you visiting a quality cafe or snacking pit stop shop without having to hop in a car and drive there is rare unless you live in downtown LV, but then you'll have to deal random fart smells and cigarette smoke everywhere. 

I can throw a rock and hit the Tangerine Cafe from my apt balcony. This spot is located just behind Movies and Candy off Eastern. It's a small bright coffee shop that offers the basic coffee shop items; muffins, breakfast sandwiches, and the always-tasty yogurt parfaits. They also have Panini's, sandwich wraps, and salads, plus a pretty sweet check-in offer of a free 12 oz. Passion Fruit Iced Tea. 

I ordered the Baked Ham and Mozzarella Panini. This was a good sized for a coffee shop lunch, but it was a little on the pricey side at $9 - $12 with my Iced coffee. It had good flavor and definitely hit the spot at that moment, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to travel far distances for this, except I would provide a, 
\"if you're in the area...\" type response. 

So, \"if you're in the area\", hit up the Tangerine Cafe."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Getting my car cleaned and saw this place from the car wash and decided to pop in for breakfast. Had the turkey sausage wrap and a chai iced tea. Service was good. Glad I stopped by."}
{"text":"Love this cafe tucked away in Henderson. Great coffee and limited, but tasty menu. I love the veggie hash and turkey egg in brioche."}
{"text":"Service was great! The ladies greeted us and we're very informative. Ordered a decaf Americano with white mocha, they asked how much white mocha etc which was great because sometimes it's too much or not enough. That was my reason for 3 stars.... The food was ok... I ordered bagel panini which is bacon, egg, cheese and I asked for cream cheese as well. It was something I could've made at home. I probably would've even made it better... Everything bagel, not plain/ jalapeño bacon etc.... Something! It was very plain. My fiancé had the pulled pork wrap... The first thing he said was, \"they forgot to add flavor\" and \"The pulled pork tasted like it was put in a crock pot with water, I've never had pulled pork with zero flavor.\" A restaurant needs to be something it's too hard to make at home, smoke the meat, use different flavors I can't find at the grocery store, etc. The salsa that they put on the side was ok, but not very flavorful either. I read reviews that the Ruben was to die for, I regret my decision on not getting that because we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Perhaps they have one chef that is better than the other and some of us just got the lesser of the two....just our bad luck or what is good to some may not be good for others.  We eat out at least one meal a day so I think we are fairly good judges but everyone's taste differs so judge for yourselves and yelp.  That is what we do and Yelp helps us make choices.  My choice is not to try that eatery again....plus they don't take constructive criticism too well. Someone from that eatery responded to my Yelp saying he apologized that is not true...never even  saw the man but they did make another just an iota better...his post also said I posted 15 one star yelps...not true...I recall one other one star .... STACK restaurant in a casino and it was bad from greeting thru cocktails then dirty dishes then awful food and customers so angry that they were leaving the place leaving food uneaten....but to my recollection...that is my only other one star....believe what you want to...I have no reason to pick on this place.  I wish it were good.  We need good local eatery's."}
{"text":"Love the service, Sascha provided a pleasurable experience.  Now about the food, it was delicious.  Had the spinach wrap with turkey chorizo, was on the small side.  Could add a bit more ingredients and it would be perfect"}
{"text":"To get 5 stars from me is hard. For 5 stars you need to meet: great atmosphere, great staff, great music, great food, cleanliness, and the place must \"flow.\" 

Decided to give this place a try on New Years Day. I really wanted to like this place. It just didn't feel like a cafe. It felt like to me someone threw this place together last minute to open. Now to the food - it was so so. I ordered a turkey & egg wrap and a cup of coffee.  The wrap isn't something to run home and brag about, but the coffee was good. 

~ dislikes 
         Too much going on in the front area.
         No creamer out front to put how much you           want in the coffee. 
         The hot sauce only in one big bottle so if someone was using it you don't get any until they're done with it. 
         Need different music for a café. The music made me want to fall asleep, not hangout longer.

         Staff was helpful.
         The coffee was fresh and hot.

I would go back for a cup of coffee, but be hesitant to eat."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting the cafe. It's a bit hidden behind buildings. The staff was friendly, but no one was in the shop which made it odd and dead. The menu seems to offer a good variety of options for coffee and non-coffee drinkers. I would say their food is on the pricier side. But it's warm, tasty and definitely worth trying. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian Panini for lunch and was very pleased! Everything tasted fresh, including my tea. The bread was delicious. Staff was wonderful as well. I will definitely be returning! 

They also have healthy snacks, some being gluten free."}
{"text":"This little nook is usually pretty empty on the weekends which is usually a BAD sign for a breakfast joint! The coffee here is great and fresh. I love the complimentary orange water they offer as soon as you walk in. Funny we walked in thinking it was a dinner and when I saw only Starbucks esque sandwiches and wraps on the menu my heart sank. So after grabbing the house blend and scadadaling over to a more hearty breakfast option I did have a chance to try the coffee and I will definitely swing by here over the local Starbucks. Nice and clean every where in there as well."}
{"text":"Best latte ever! Not bitter or sour. Also got a mini strudel warmed up, which was amazing, and a turkey sausage wrap. Loved it all. Excellent customer service (which is rare these days)."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this place. Very cute decor and very friendly barista. They made me a fabulous sandwich- spinach, egg white and cheese on a soft amazing bun. They have milk alternatives. Next time I'll get almond or coconut milk instead of soy. I could see myself frequenting this joint. Great job."}
{"text":"Good food!  Good coffee!  Mellow jazz overhead.  Really chill environment.   The only thing I'd say about this spot is the location is unfortunate.  It was pretty empty when we went in,  which was great because quick service, but if you could see it from the street I'm sure business would be booming.  Other than that thumbs WAY up!"}
{"text":"I like this cute breakfast spot!
Within a mile, you have this place, Egg Works and Craft Kitchen for the options for breakfast. (I'm so jealous of you Anthem people!! I only have one breakfast option in So. Highlands...) Out of these three places, I would pick this place if I'm in a rush and want to get in and out. The service is super fast!! The food came out in less than 5 minutes.
I ordered breakfast pulled pork wrap to go. It was delicious. Sweet and Tangy BBQ pulled pork inside was not fatty at all. This wrap gave me the energy for the entire day (I would say 900 calories but worth it.) I ate it in my car. It was very messy. Got stains on my shirt, jeans and seat belt. I do not recommend eating this in your car. 
The lady that took my order was very nice and friendly. 
I'll be back here to try their freshly made scones and coffee :-)"}
{"text":"Nicolette made me a wonderful smoothie of banana, pineapple and strawberry. The whipped cream on top was a nice touch and could represent the topping and the engaging conversation and hospitality as well. Go here..."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff! I ordered the Ham & Mozz with passion fruit black tea. I was a perfect lunch for warm weather. Food was delicious! The ambience nice! It looks spacious with all the windows and there is outside seating if you want to enjoy the weather outside. Love painted mural. If will try their Turkey Chorizo Hash next time I come back."}
{"text":"A nice little spot. Nice take on the corned beef hash and eggs.  I wish that they offered full eggs vs egg whites.  But, the sauce makes up for that. I can't wait to try the chicken and chorizo version.  ... the music selection was perfect for my mood.  It's out of my way but I'll make at least one more special trip.  ...don't forget to check in for your free drink."}
{"text":"Excellent food choices and always friendly staff. I love this place for a quick and inexpensive lunch bite. There's plenty of room inside to cool and some tables outside when it's that perfect time of year."}
{"text":"This place has such a welcoming atmosphere with a variety of seating for every vibe. The wraps are amazing and super affordable. I've tried the chorizo and the turkey both spinach wraps. I also recommend the golden beet salad with chicken! It's family owned, and really hospitable. Everything I look for in a great cafe. This is an awesome place to get some work done. Too good to not share with the world. Will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at The Tangerine Cafe and it was delicious. I had the Baked Ham,Mozzarella Panini along with their yummie Ginger,Carrot soup. It was soooo good.You need to try their homemade brownie too if you have room for more ;-)"}
{"text":"Had had my eye on this new place since it opened. Finally tried it today. Delicious food. Very friendly staff. Great portion sizes and great prices. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Terrific breakfasts, both healthy and tasty. Maybe nicest staff overall in Henderson. I hope they stay in business as front faces away from Eastern and we never saw it until it was recommended."}
{"text":"Drove by here on our way to a company picnic last Sunday and we decided to check it out.

In the Upper Henderson bordering on Anthem area so our expectations were set pretty high. It's located in what looks like a warehouse type district and when we pulled up the lot was filled with Porches, Mercedes, and Lexus' galore.

The inside was clean and cute but nothing spectacular and in all honestly the menu was nothing exciting as far as drinks go.

I ordered a Watermelon Limeade because no coffee options stood out to me and my friend ordered a Tangerine Lemonade (which i guess is one of their \"specialty\" drinks.)

I was more than dissapointed to see that my drink was nothing but some store bought juice...

Nothing specialty about buying limeade at the store putting ice in a cup and pouring the pre made, pre-bought juice into said cup."}
{"text":"Had great breakfast. Enjoyed pulled pork hash. My girlfriend had corn beef hash. Both tasted great. Great service. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem! Great ambiance and delicious food! Employees were very welcoming and received great service. Will be back for many more visits."}
{"text":"While I wait for my car to get detailed (same shopping center) I always dine here. 

Love the corn beef hash ~ my go to entree. 

Favorite. Delicious. Flavorful. Awesome. 

Service has always been friendly, fast & with a smile. 

Glad I found it ~"}
{"text":"Super cute inside, has that natural feel with I feel like a slightly beach or Hawaiian theme...
Ordered a matcha frappacino, made with matcha powder and acai, coconut milk and ice in the vitamix, was thick and tasty (although the mix is high in sugar I needed a frap fix). My daughter ordered one of their homemade brownies which she said was one of the best she'd had in a long time, and she's a brownie aficionado. 
They have breakfast and lunch, salads, wraps, omelettes, and healthier options. Full coffee and tea bar.  
Very cute place. The girl serving us was super nice. Will return for food soon."}
{"text":"Great little coffee cafe with fresh food menu.  I had the turkey spinach pesto wrap special and turkey chili, both were great and not too heavy so I get back to work after without feeling lethargic.  Friendly staff and free wifi, so it looks to be a decent place to sit and work.  Not too visible from the street so be on the lookout."}
{"text":"Looks lonely. Hard to find. Had the chorizo and egg white wrap and a peppermint mocha. Not good enough to come back. Glad I tried it (?)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Henderson. Great fresh food all made by the owner and with make-it-from-scratch philosophy. My favorite are  the Turkey Chili, Golden Beet salad, and the corned beef.  Delicious. Outdoor eating and very cozy in-door setting with a big urn of  water with lemon."}
{"text":"Suuuuch a nice place! And very friendly! Espresso is Lavazza and its the best!!!! They even offer organic coconut sugar, which is unbelivable because it tastes so great and you can't find it absolutely nowhere!!!! Will make this my coffee spot for sure!! :-))"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and higher number of stars, I had high hopes for the Tangerine Cafe, but I was a bit disappointed. 

To start, it's not the easiest place to find - it's a bit hidden in the shopping center. When you walk in, there's a lot going on at the front counter. It reminds more of a coffee shop than a cafe. And the seating doesn't make me want to stay and hang out for long (especially since they don't offer wi-fi).

The food was less than stellar. The reviews reaves about the food being amazing. Maybe we didn't order the right thing. We each ordered a breakfast wrap. The turkey sausage in each wrap was dry and needs more egg. 

The coffee is really good and I'd come back for the coffee, for sure. When the weather warms up, I plan on grabbing a coffee and sitting on the patio with a good book. And since the reviews rave about this cafe, I'll give them another try at lunch one day soon."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and had the Italian panini, it was delicious! The place is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I'm so glad I found this little hidden gem. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped there on the way to a business meeting for a quick bite to eat. Found out they have one of the best caprese panini i have ever had. I hate mushrooms, but i love their cream of mushroom soup"}
{"text":"Visited The Tangerine cafe recently, 5 stars all the way thro, nice decor, comfortable seating, and very friendly staff Everything made fresh everyday. I had a panini, soup, lamonade, and cappuccino, everything was very delicious. I can not wait to go back and try more stuff on the Manu. Hope they open one more Tangerine cafe in summerlin."}
{"text":"Their PB&J coffee is amazing!!  This place was very clean and the staff was friendly. Their entire menu looked delicious! You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Fresh. Quality. Fairly priced. Well thought out menu. Unlike most cafes that have just basic food that I wouldn't order again, Tangerine Cafe has restaurant style quality. I like the low key atmosphere and they always have good music playing, today is funk & soul."}
{"text":"After having a less then perfect second visit, I was contacted by the owner who went above and beyond to make our visit perfect.  This is definitely an A+ establishment.  The owner, Jeff personally made us veggie wraps which were even better then the first time around.  Tangerine cafe has earned loyal customers with their astounding service."}
{"text":"Happy to find this locally owned spot! Their turkey chorizo is amazing and I'd definitely recommend the hash or sammie. Can't wait to come back and try the corned beef hash... And maybe a drink!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Had carrot soup. Was fairly bland. I like very spicy though. They were kind enough to switch out for chicken chili which was a good bit better. Like there to be more spices in the soups, and I don't mean spicier though that too would have been nice. I could see working or checking on emails and such here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Every time I come in they are beyond nice and remember me. The cold brew and wraps are insanely good! The cold brew isn't bitter like Starbucks (no offense Starbucks lovers). If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it. They also do discounts for teachers:)"}
{"text":"A very cozy and welcoming cafe.  The staff is very friendly.  The quantity and quality of the food are excellent. Great coffee too.  Forget Starbucks.   Come here to grab a coffee.  You won't be sorry.  Must try their signature corned beef and hash.  This is a 5 stars cafe."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Free refills on the coffee and tea. Nice lite daily specials. A favorite Saturday stop."}
{"text":"Tangerine Cafe is exactly what you would expect, it's a relaxed comfy atmosphere with good coffee and food.

They have decent selection of coffees, sandwiches and wraps.
The buffalo chicken wrap is delicious, grilled chicken with the fresh veggies, and the buffalo dressing is the kicker it's concentrated so it makes it extra tangy and spicy. 
They also make Sausage Egg Muffin sandwich, it's pretty good way better than McDonalds.

This cafe is right behind Movies & Candy, works out perfectly for me as far as convenience. I'm either always returning a movie and/or if I need a bite to eat after working out. The staff are nice people and they provide great service. 

I do agree with others reviews, it's a great passerby cafe but I don't think worth making a long distance trip."}
{"text":"Breakfast served all day!! :) my friend and I came in for brunch, place is a little bit hidden but the food was delicious! And great pricing! I usually go to places similar to this and are way more expensive! Everyone was super friendly! We were so glad to have found this spot"}
{"text":"I never would have known about this place - it's hidden in the back of a shopping center and there isn't the best signage.  We had the egg white, turkey sausage wrap and the chorizo turkey & egg white panini and both were very good.  The coffee frappe could have used a little more coffee and less ice, but overall this is a nice little cafe to grab a bite or have a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I just found the place, wasn't easy either, but when i saw that they serve lavazza coffee I had to stop for a quick lunch. They had a small menu but just enough choices in the salad and sandwich section  and also had a great hot or cold beverage selection the place is new and very clean and organized. I'm a corporate exec chef and pastry chef for 45 years n NYC and just moved here so I observe everything. I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken and was not disappointed and see the chicken was grilled  then brought to proper temp to serve cold and wasn't dry at all my brother also a chef, was impressed with the golden beet salad with goat cheese. We went in because of the coffee and left happy . Chef vic"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the food is delicious. Every time I go, I always order the Corn Beef Hash (egg whites, with this delicious creamy sauce, potato chunks and corn beef chunks) - two thumbs up every single time! 

The vibe is cute and comfy. There's tables outside where you can enjoy your meal. 

Don't forget to tip! They bring your food to your table and the staff is always so attentive. 

Great place and great location!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast. I got smoked salmon with the bagel. It took them 10 minutes to come out and tell me that they were out of bagels. By then my, husband's sandwich was done. The sandwich however was very good."}
{"text":"Took advantage of the Yelp! deal.  Cute little place hidden in a plaza.  The staff is very friendly and the waffles are tasty!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Saw the excellent reviews on yelp and had to come check it out. The location was not easy to find as It in the back of a complex on eastern, but once we went inside It was pretty inviting. The interior was nicely decorated,  had comfy seats and the staff was super friendly.

 My friend and i had just gotten coffee so we didn't try theirs, but they had some interesting espresso orange options that i may need to go back and try.  I got the espresso pulled pork sandwich that came with a small cucumber salad in a cup. The sandwich itself was good,  but for the price was pretty small.  I felt full after eating it but wasnt starving when we got there either. My friend got the Turkey chilli and that was really good , a bigger portion then my meal for half the price! 

Overall I liked that it was a nice, clean, and relaxing place to hang out. It was really quiet when we were there so maybe a better spot for a more intimate hangout and not a crazy loud group  hangout.  Or for working on a laptop, seems like it would be good for that as well. We had a nice experience here, nothing amazing but it was pleaseant. I'd come back if I was up in that area again but I am not in love."}
{"text":"I am so happy I decided to come here last-minute. This cafe had a very cozy feel to it, loved the decors along the wall near the back corner. The staff was so friendly and welcoming that I'd just want to keep coming back just because of that. 

I ordered the bacon, whole egg and cheddar bagel panini with a side of an almond milk latte. 
The panini was so simple yet delicious! I don't know what brand of bagels they have (or if it's home made) but it was so soft and chewy. My only complaint is that there isn't a \"jumbo size\" option on the menu because I felt like I can eat about 10 of those bagel paninis in one sitting. 

The latte really hit the spot too--you can taste the quality of the coffee they brewed. Also, I LOVE that they had almond milk as an alternative!

Wish I lived in Henderson because I would definitely be a regular at this coffee shop. If you're near the area or live in Henderson, I would absolutely recommend the Tangerine Cafe."}
{"text":"What a gem to find tucked around the corner from Egg Works (yuck chain). They serve a wonderful LavAzza latte with latte art. I'm a coffee snob but this place is perfect. I also had the Veggie Hash with brussel sprouts, mushrooms and onions; it was huge for like $8!! This is my new sweet place to relax off the busy streets!!!"}
{"text":"Was very pleased with this cute little place....We had the Caesar salad and Cream of Mushroom soup.....very tasty....Can't wait to try there other soups...the young lady that waited on us was sooooo nice...Hope people will try this place ..it is on backside of building....Maybe get a BIG sign out front..."}
{"text":"Small local cafe tucked behind Seven Hills car wash and serving customers with a smile. 
The decor is a mixture of burlap sacks and old barrels with interesting artwork, and has a welcoming charm appeal to it. 
The best part is the food.  I read some great reviews and Yelp didn't steer me wrong.  We ordered a breakfast wrap and the corn beef hash. Afraid it was going to be salty, our cashier who was also our server was really helpful in her suggestion to select these dishes.
The corn beef hash is outstanding and reminds me more of a potato scramble with their lovely home made hollandaise sauce.  This dish was filling with a espresso cup filled with fresh fruits.  

You can sit tucked away at the corner with outlets to charge your laptop or device to have a laid back atmosphere to punch through the day.  

This is a cute spot for lunch or brunch and the prices are affordable.  There is coffee and home made dessert that I'll have to try next time."}
{"text":"Always great. So nice with my children and willing to help me with lunch or snack options for them!"}
{"text":"Even though the service was a little awkward and the teenagers working there didn't know much about the menu, the food at The Tangerine Cafe was excellent. I had the roasted beet salad and my sister ordered the Jamaican chicken wrap. We both were really happy with our meals. I am sure I will be eating here again on future trips to Henderson."}
{"text":"The green tea frap was awesome and the iced chai tea !!! The cafe is a must to go very spacious and cozy to have drinks with friends. I will def be coming back when I visit Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot ! Fresh and healthy sandwiches and soups and awesome coffee. Would definitely come back!"}
