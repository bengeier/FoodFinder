{"text":"I was rushed to order my food and made a mistake I got yelled at and told you wrong and was giving the same broth from the pervious soup. I don't eat fish or sea food as it makes me sick but I was given tripe and other seafood in my soup and they gave me my soup and I was unsatisfied with the used broth and service. Don't think I'll come back and this was my 4 time in 2 weeks"}
{"text":"I ordered 1 large house special pho soup and my fiancée ordered crispy noodle. The pho broth was good, but the portions of meat was very little. The crispy noodle wasn't crispy at all, and was all soggy."}
{"text":"Flavor is average, on the low end for Vietnamese and the meat portion is very disappointing. I created a yelp account just to warn everyone else. 8 dollar meal but 6 dollars for extra meat."}
{"text":"We now come here regularly and out of the number of places we've had pho, this is our favourite. It's warm, not too loud, very clean, very attentive, quiet but mannerly young staff, and the toilets nice and clean! I always get the F4 and A3 with no mint leaves and a nestea :-)"}
{"text":"We went this afternoon to try this place, myself, my mom, my 7 year old son, my 2 year old daughter, and 1 year old son, we did not get to order as it isn't for families that has children requiring high/booster seat as they don't have it, I asked the server who greeted us how will they accommodate families with young children and he just shrugged his shoulder!!  Will never go back !"}
{"text":"Decent family owned restaurant. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is very friendly. 

I really enjoy their crispy noodles with mixed vegetables and chicken. The pork spring rolls are good as well but I prefer it with the peanut sauce. 

I'm not a fan of their pad Thai, too many sprouts and barely any noodles. The pho is ok, I like that they actually make the broth spicy rather than telling me to add sriracha (happens more often than you think)."}
{"text":"I had the wonton and char sew with egg noodles,

although it was good it was missing major salt and MEAT! 

it came with 3 pieces of char sew pork and about 3 wontons."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Order drinks all you want, you won't get them.
Smaller servings compared to others."}
{"text":"So had lunch here today and I probably won't go back here.  Yes it's probably the only pho place on the east side of Brampton, but take an extra drive to the west side of btown where it will be worth your money.

I got the beef stew with rice noodles and there was not much flavour.  I tried to add hoisin and siracha but that didn't help much either.  Could have used more meat in my dish for sure.  The fried spring rolls and fresh rolls are so skinny that you feel like you were eating nothing.  The peanut sauce for the fresh roll was good.  Definitely not worth the money I paid for, I was still hungry.  My usual pho place I never finish my food and so full we take the rest home of what we can. 

I give them that the look of the restaurant is nice and modern compared to the other local pho restaurants, but the food does not compare.  If you took the look of the restaurant and merged the food with another pho place, it could work.  

For regular Vietnamese food lovers, I'm sure they wouldn't be happy with the food portion here.  For those ppl who might want to try something new, probably won't know what they're missing out on if they've never been to other pho restaurants before."}
{"text":"This place most likely will not last long if they do not improve the quality of their food immediately. I have been here 3 times because I really wanted to give them a chance. However I know that I will never be going back again. The broth is always too oily and it is like they forgot to skim the fat off of the top or were just too lazy to do it or simply do not care. Their fresh rolls are so small and tiny that they do not taste good and once again make it seem like their chef is just unhappy.

The last time I went here I told the lady at the counter about how bad the food was but I really do not think she understood a word I said because she was just focused on making me pay my bill....okay cool no tip and never returning for sure.

I would really avoid coming back here or driving all the way to Mississauga or Toronto for some decent pho."}
{"text":"Nice new Pho restaurant, close to home BUT the food is horrible, cheap old meat, not fresh....I don't think that the owner know how to make authentic Vietnamese pho or other dishes in general.  They may think that we don't know......they are wrong!!  Don't waist your time and money eating crap......"}
{"text":"Average pho restaurant in a terrible location. Tucked away in a plaza in a plaza of random stores. The clientele there is mostly Caucasians and the odd Asians that only know about the place through Yelp. This is one of the restaurants that focuses more on the decor rather the quality of food. You usually don't get great service at an asian restaurant but this place was less than average. It was definitely family owned but the kids working as servers need to know how to great customers and take orders when the patrons are seated.

The food itself was meh. We each ordered a bowl of pho and a side order of fresh spring rolls. The pho broth was alright....very light and lacking in flavour. The noodles were good nice and silky but the meat to noodle ratio was not even. They definitely cheaped out on this..maybe like 3 pieces of meat in my bowl. I will only come here again if I am in the area.

----

Updating this review after yet another horrible experience. Pho broth was way too oily, found a piece of hair in the soup and pad thai was just way too sweet and also very oily. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Pho is the perfect cold weather and hangover food. But if you've had an authentic bowl of pho, then this place wouldn't hit the spot. The pho soup is very diluted; you can't taste the spices that's used to make it and it's bland. The amount of meat is very sparse and makes the bowl look sad and empty. The portions are also smaller and more expensive than other pho restaurants. 
You're better off having a bowl of pho somewhere else but if you come here, maybe give the other dishes a try."}
{"text":"Service has improved over the past few months. This is a family restaurant so I like to support the small shops! Yes there is better pho, but if I don't want to trek to far for my pho fix, this is good enough. So I give this place a 5* for being family owned and a small business trying to support its family. Food is good too!! I posted the menu because their website is down ? :( I don't want them to go out of business :("}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple months ago when they opened and forgot to write a review! I was excited when this place opened because they're super close to my work and there aren't really Vietnamese places on this side of Brampton. 
But the food was just meh... My friend and I both ordered pho, and we both agreed that the broth just tasted off or weird in comparison to the pho we've both known and tasted elsewhere. Couldn't put our finger on what was wrong but as a result we both ended up trying to mask the weird flavours with hoisin and Sriracha which helped a little (because Sriracha is amazing lol). I also ordered the cold shrimp roll and again, it just tasted off, too much of a certain herb and it just overpowered all the flavours. My friend got the avocado shake and he said it was good, so at least there's that's :p 

Probs won't go back tbh, I'll just go further to Saigon house or even further to Pho Mi 66 when I'm in Brampton a craving some good pho."}
{"text":"LOCATION AND APPEARANCE:
Let's start off with location.. it's an odd spot to have a Phò place it's like when your in a small town in the middle of nowhere and it's hidden.. at first I thought it was busy but I guess all the cars that were there were for the bar and grill across from it.. entering the place you just see a big red cow display say Calgary which is odd since the location is brampton..

SERVICE:
When my son and I got there it was just two other couples and no greeting or saying anything they looked up and continued what they were doing..We sat ourselves usually at other phó place they show you which spot so they can keep an eye on you and know who just arrived and all.. there's an fairly old lady that I guess just works on the register and making drinks while a young boy grabs the paper orders from the table and brings them their food. The boy brought us 2 small cups of water (yes no hot tea). After looking through their menu we couldn't find the workers that my 4 year old son stood up to give them our paper of what we would like to order.

MENU:
Small menu there's not alot of options to look at especially for their egg noodle section. But I recommend looking at their take out menu because ALL THE PRICES IN THE TABLE MENU ARE LOWER THEN WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR TAKE OUT MENU . and I noticed the lady didn't want to give me a print out of what I ordered just straight to the debit machine and receipt of what I paid which I find odd is it because they don't want people to see the prices are higher then what's in the menu on the table..

FOOD:
Came out very quick which I find suspicious except for the phó soup cause we all know those come out fast but like what I ordered Pad Thai usually that takes time but came out so quick wasn't hot at all more like room temperature  and the fresh rolls usually takes time to make them to wrap it properly and fried rolls I could taste they were pre-fried had a chewy texture.. the food did taste òk my son enjoy his phó with rare beef and beef balls we requested no green onion or onion since it's my 4 year old son who's eating it.  The size portion I would say it for your hungry get a main dish and a side dish their small is like a kiddy size and their pad thai has a small portion. THEY don't have many options of drinks I did get the avocado shake what I usually get at any phó place it did lack flavor it was watered down a bit.

FINAL COMMENTS:
Would I go back again most likely not cause they don't have many selections on their menu and seeing that they have two different pricing from the table menu and take out menu and they didn't show me my print out of what I ordered to see if it was correct I find that not right unless they plan on changing that way of functioning. Did it feed my son and my son enjoyed it yes that part I'm happy about but the rest needs more improvement."}
{"text":"The food here is average. Nothing more, nothing less. I had a bowl of pho and my coworker tried a vermicelli dish. Both were standard orders for Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA. I can't comment on the vermicelli dish but my broth was passable and the quantity of beef was decent.

It's the service that I thought was lacking. My coworker and I were clearly on our lunch break, yet our dishes were brought out nearly 30 minutes apart. This is totally unacceptable in itself, but what made it worse is that we had to ask for an update on when the dish was coming. When the dish finally arrived, there was no apology or anything - it was just set on the table and the server walked away. 

It wasn't just us who had issues with the wait. The table behind us also had their dishes brought 30 minutes apart, and there was a man who was visibly upset after having waited over 30 minutes for his takeout order.

Seeing as how it's a new restaurant, I'm accepting of shortfalls when it comes to wait times - but the staff could have handled it better when resolving the situations with their patrons. All the wait staff were quite young, so hopefully they grow with experience.

I'll be back, because they still are one of the only Vietnamese restaurants in the region (east Brampton) and the food was alright. Hopefully they iron out their kinks for my next visit!"}
{"text":"LOCATION AND APPEARANCE:
It's hidden away in a very small secluded town... in an industrial area-ish.

SERVICE:
The service was very rushed, it seems like they were not taught common manners and courtesy of running a restaurant and does not admit own faults. The business is run by very sketchy people.

MENU:
It is cheaper to eat in than eat out since there's a price difference. They will not give you their take out menu if asked.

FOOD:
They went very stingy on the meat. Ordered a large and got three pieces of meat.

Congradulation, you've made it on my #Boycott list."}
{"text":"Please do not order house deep fried spring roll!!!unless you are a fan of heartburn, eh almost 24 hours past still have and cant get rid off..."}
{"text":"There isnt a lot of good Pho places in my area of Brampton. This recently opened up and I had high hopes that it would be very good so I can finally have one I can go to with confidence.

It nothing spectacular, really. I think one thing that makes it stand out than the rest of the places in Brampton is that its a bright open space since its a newer restaurant.

The prices are okay, I think a few cents cheaper than other places. But then they make up the difference by their serving size.

My mom and I had a bowl of the vermicelli noodles (with shrimp, bbq pork, and spring roll) and a bowl of our favorite beef stew with rice noodle. There was BARELY any bbq pork. And half of the bowl was shredded lettuce. As for the soup, Im not that crazy about the flavor. I definitely have had better. The beef tendon was HARD. Like I had to use a knife hard. The first time Ive had to use one while eating soup. And the serving is tiny. I understand that the soup only has one size, but its the smallest Ive had out of all the pho places Ive been to (Brampton and Mississauga).

I will stick with Pho Kennedy until another one comes up. Unfortunately, I will probably only go here if I was badly desperate for soup and feeling too lazy to drive the other 10 mins to Kennedy."}
{"text":"The soup here is ok... but the service... SLOW!!!
There is no sense of urgency to serve their customers.  If you are here during your lunchtime, it is not a good idea.
2 Rare Beef pho and its beein 15mins... still waiting.
Anyone who has been to Pho places know... it is instant.

Not happy"}
{"text":"Wanted to try out a pho spot in Brampton and happened to land on Pho 123. My boy was actually checking the place out on his phone not too sure how but he ended up choosing Pho 123. 

The spot is in a new area, and it's pretty dead because it's developing and it's a big place and not many people were inside, opened the menu pretty basic got the B1 house special with the works a Large at that! $8 and 2 spring rolls for $3.50 and an avocado shake for $3.50 total almost $17 which is not bad at all I was \"good\" after I could still function.

The Pho was okay, not the best, the spring rolls were on point! Crispy crispy crisp all day and the avocado shake was exactly what I had tasted in my head. Avocado blended up and it was okay. The lady who helped us was a sweet older women and a younger genetlemen who served us. They were both great people. 

Would I come back yes. Would I recommend? Yes because it's the only spot in Brampton and it's a bigger modern day spot."}
{"text":"Craving Pho, this was the only game in the Airport Rd. Hwy 7 area in Brampton. Ratings are pretty poor on Yelp! but that's generally never stopped me before.

The menu contained more than just Vietnamese food, and to reiterate my theory on that, you either have one worldly Chef at the helm, or an overly ambitious one! 

The staff spoke Vietnamese, which was a little reassuring. And the majority of patrons coming in were Asian (we must have brought the crowd as there were only 2 other tables when we arrived.)

Sticking to satisfy my craving, I kept to the Viet fare. Pho Dac Biet; Bun Thit Nuong, chai tom, Cha Gio; Com Chien Bo Luc Lax.

Pho is a vermicelli noodle soup. The Dac Biet means special, which basically means it comes with everything. PHO 123's came with beef brisket, medium rare beef, tripe, beef balls, and beef tendon. The beef balls did not contain any beef tendon in its mix, which was fine by me since the dish came with beef tendon. But the tendon was disappointing as they were really small pieces. The tripe was cut into thin strips, but I prefer it that way. And the beef was thinly sliced to cook quickly in the soup. The brisket was actually excellent! Very tender and not stringy. But Pho is not about the toppings, it's about the broth! Unfortunately Pho 123 didn't even hit water after falling out of this boat. This was definitely not Pho broth, and a little on the salty. The only real explanation I can come up for this is that they made the soup from scratch (i.e. no pho cube), but if that was the case, they would not be in business for long. The broth would take several hours to cook and they would need to invest in a lot of bones. 1 star.

Thit Nuong is the same vermicelli as the Pho, but without the soup. It comes with fish sauce instead. I ordered the one that came with grilled pork, sugar cane shrimp, and a sprig roll. I forgot to mention earlier that some places give you choice of fresh vermicelli, but no such offering here. Not a big deal to me, because I've gotten used to the packaged stuff, and prefer it to fresh noodles. Much like the Pho, the accompanying fish sauce is key to this dish. That and the flavor of the grilled meats. In this case both were decent; the fish sauce not overpowering, and not too sweet. The pork was thin slices and had very subtle hints of lemongrass and onion oil. The spring roll was the smallest I've ever had, measuring just over a cm in diameter. The filling did not have the proper meat to veggie ratio, but they did use the proper (rice) wrap. What was more shocking than the spring roll was the sugar cane shrimp. Normally you get a small bulb of minced shrimp mixed with flour (or minced fish if you're lucky), but here there was no bulb. It was as if the rolled the sugar cane on shrimp batter! (See pic). 1,5 stars. 

The Com Luc Lac is a rice dish with marinated cubes of tenderloin fried in Luc Lac sauce with veggies. But no such luck here, the beef was not any type of loin. It was dry and the sauce was completely off as it tasted like black bean beef (which is a Chinese sauce). The rice is normally steamed, but here they serve it with a vegetable fried rice which also lacked any depth in flavor. 1 star.

The menu also lacked in terms of drinks. No sour sop or durian shakes. No icee jelly drinks either. Overall, I think the reviews are generous. While the food didn't taste BAD in a literal sense, I did not enjoy it at all. This place shows as $$. While just about every item was under $10 (so it should be rated $), the portions are beyond skimpy. In that sense I can see why people are rating it expensive. For what you get, and the taste, the next time I need a fix, I'll hold out until I can get back to  the city... no need for the two or three for Pho 123, Pho 1 is sufficient, as in Pho 1 star..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got take out from this place tonight. We found it because we were driving through the plaza awhile ago and decided to try it out tonight. 
All I can say is WOW. 
I got a pork on vermicelli and it was amazing. The pork was cooked to perfection. We got crispy spring rolls that were cooked and seasoned to perfection. No sauce needed. Everything tasted so good on it's own. 
All the food was fresh and well presented. Nothing left the kitchen without being presented and approved by the owner. This place is truly a hidden gem. A must try!! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After seeing the restaurant a couple of weeks ago. I finally decided to give it a try. I ordered a small bowl of pho dac biet and deep fried spring rolls. The food came out fast. The pho was pretty much average. My only complaint was the portion looked small because of the appearance of the small bowl size(comparing to other pho restaurant bowl sizes and style). But I would say the portion is pretty much average. The staff are young and friendly.
If you're in the area and want decent Vietnamese food, you can give it a try(since east Brampton has almost no Vietnamese restaurants around within 10km)."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. The server was very friendly and tentative. We both had the rice noodle and chicken soup and I would just like to say that it was DELICIOUS! I would highly recommend it. The broth was so flavourful. I will definitely becoming back for more."}
{"text":"Food: meh
Their large size pho is equal to a small size at most other places. 
Service: 
The younger waitstaff are very polite and accommodating. The lady behind the counter who seemed like the owner was extremely rude and not at all helpful.
I'd rather make the drive down to pho mi 66 on Steeles and resolution, or to Mississauga."}
{"text":"First time here tonight with my girlfriend. We usually drive to west Brampton to get Pho but we decided to give this place a try because it was much much closer. Was greeted and seated immediately as we arrived. Broth was very flavourful. I got the rare beef and beef brisket Pho and they were generous with the meat. My girl got the avocado shake and she thoroughly enjoyed it. The ambience/dining area is very nice. The location in the plaza is pretty tucked away but the food is on point.

Looking at the negative comments below and I'm not sure where it's coming from tbh. Sound like a bunch of haters."}
{"text":"Simply the best Beef soup, the broth is so amazing, and just a quick note the small is sufficient enough."}
