{"text":"Oct. 31 2015 my Meetup group of 40 or so arrived here today. Speaking for my small group of 8 or so, at my table, we loved this place! The server Toby ( beautiful Australian ) served us with warm efficiency to the end! The manageress even came by to see how we were etc. I'm glad to say my lamburger with arugula was delicious, French fries served with aplomb. It's what I expect from a better then the usual pub! Nice, check it out!"}
{"text":"Despite other reviewers, I am a fan. 

It was about time this Fox got a new name and face. It's been a little while now, but I figured it's time for me to chime in. 

Much of the same can still be said: great food and drink selection, friendly service.
Still the same great, hands-on owners and management making sure their guests have a good experience (and like most places, regulars are always very well looked after.. and this establishment has a lot of them). Still mostly the same staff, with a few new faces as well. Still houses the same great, spacious facilities - three amazing patios, including a non-smoking patio and a roof-top patio (worth the 4 stars alone)! A cozy bar and booths add to the intimate atmosphere, as does a pool table in the back and TVs EVERYWHERE (including a massive floor-to-ceiling projection screen in the main room). The establishment itself underwent an impressively quick renovation, that definitely did the trick - visually more of a restaurant feel than a pub, but they're still home to Tuesday Trivia Nights and Thursday Karaoke, as well as daily food & drink specials to boot!  

Prices have gone up a bit, as expected. The menu is more concise and more interesting - having tried most of the menu now, I have yet to be disappointed, and have found a few new favourites. The bar has been bolstered with many new beers on tap, including some craft brews. 

Of all the pubs in the neighbourhood, this is still my go-to for good reason."}
{"text":"Servers seem to be lost and service isn't very good. I ordered a drink and took them almost 15 min to bring it to my table (and the place was not busy). 

I had the bison burger which was a bit dry but flavour was good. I asked for ketchup and the waitress brings me a little cup with ketchup (probably a tablespoon). I asked for another one and she rolled her eyes."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The music is loud and distracting, the beer is overpriced, something you don't find out until you get your bill, because they don't have anything as obvious as say...a bar menu or price listing. The food is substandard. The burger was dry and expensive and the fries were cold. The front area is stifling hot, with the sun shining right in and no blinds for the windows. Who in hell would have west facing picture windows with no blinds?! Just stupid. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Come for the alcohol NOT for the food. It's a great looking establishment perfect to watch the game at. I ordered a crispy chicken poutine and the fries tasted like they were 2 days old. Then I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were fresh and very tasty. The burger not only looked like it was a frozen burger before coming to my plate but it also tasted worse than any microwave burger I've had in high school. Huge disappointment. Unfortunately, I will not come back."}
{"text":"The service is not professional and the breakfast was very badly made. Have been here a few times but not coming back again for sure! The western omelette felt like it was cooked in the microwave and the bread was dry. There were 3 potato wedges and the sausage was cold. To worsen it, Water was offered in plastic cups."}
{"text":"Terrible.

I visited before numerous times when it was a Fox&Fiddle. The only redeeming factor was that the menu items were decent. The service however was bad.

Guess what? Service is still bad and the new menu is extremely unattractive. They dont even serve a regular burger or chicken wings without adding something really funky to it (crab cakes on a bison burger??) I had to return a spinach omelette plate because it was just so poorly made.

Their beverage cups smelt funky and the decor is also very underwhelming. The servers seemed lost not knowing which table ordered what and wait times were extremely long.

Do not recommend. Wont be visiting again."}
{"text":"ANTS!!!! we had ants in our lemons and limes.  Like nested in them. We drank part of the sangria before we noticed and was appuled by it. Our waiter only came to take our first drink order and food and did not check on us again. I had to bring it to the bar. They were appaulagetic about it and spoke to the manager on our behalf. But only took off the one drink and 10percent off. I think it could have handled it better and we didn't even want our leftover because of how upset we were. The manager was nice but more could have been done, we have went 2 to 3 times a week since we moved to the city"}
{"text":"This place is not off to a great start.  I've tried it twice so far and it's been 0 for 2.  Firstly, they have beers on the menu that they serve downstairs but couldn't bring one up to the upstairs patio...Really??  Staples like wings are ok.  But the burger was mediocre, the jambalaya was sad (no rice and a few little shrimp) and others complained that the Burrito Bowl was blah.  The menu tries to insert all these funky creations but they should instead just focus on doing things right."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Have been trying to get service for 10 minutes with no success. Been brushed off multiple times by staff. Would probably still be waiting at the door if we hadn't grabbed a table ourselves since the hostess stand has been empty the entire time."}
{"text":"This was a nice spot for a warm summer evening. We came to grab a drink on one of there couple patios which are quite nice. Average pricing and choice for drinks selection. Service was slow in the beginning but out server warmed up to us by the end and was very cheerful, but there was minor sass here and there. She spilled water on me which is fine, but then forgot to bring me a drink twice. Overall it's definitely a great drinking hub in this area and best for patios for sure. I think we just came on an off night but overall I enjoyed myself and would come back!"}
{"text":"I came here for an event last night and had a good experience. We had an excellent waiter who was efficient at taking orders from late comers. I arrived an hour after the event began and he came over and immediately brought me a water and placed my order.  I was really impressed considering we were a large group of about 40 people. 

The menu didn't have too many gluten and dairy free options but I was able to purchase their spinach salad. The spinach salad was average but I was happy I could eat something beyond straight mixed greens at a bar. 

Service: 5 stars
Food: 3 stars
Parking: 3 stars

In this area you need to find street parking, which is a little challenging. 

Allover, I would return here for another event."}
{"text":"WTF have they done to the Fox and Fiddle? 

What used to be a friendly, fun local pub is now a sad, trying to be flashy restaurant with servers in short black skirts and low cut tops with their breasts in my face. Gross. All I wanted was nachos, and they were gross, too.

I was intrigued that the new menu included the option to add duck to your nachos. EPIC FAIL. If the small shreds of fowl on my nachos were indeed duck, it was the driest, oldest duck I've ever had. At all other \"gastro pubs\", the duck used to top things is confit, which is moist and has been slow cooked in it's own fat. What I could find on my nachos was dry, and tasted like old turkey or maybe it was wet cardboard used to store old turkey.  Either way, it was, indeed, FOUL.

The nachos used to be great at the Fox and Fiddle and my friend and I would regularly visit just to have them. This place was a huge disappointment from the service which was haphazard and spotty, to the food, which was absolute crap.

Not to mention the fact that what this place has become a lame version of something you'd find at Yonge and Eglinton, but I don't think it's going to fly at Yonge and St. Clair, where the mainstay is older people, families and locals who want either casual pub fare or fine dining. Fox and Fiddle used to be a large chain restaurant, but at least they had good food, friendly service and a pub environment. They knew what they were. Midtown \"Gastro Hub\" is sadly confused as to what it wants to be. I give this incarnation a year to be driven into a sinkhole of oblivion. The owner who did this has fallen prey to the new corporate breastaurant structure serving shit food and asking their servers to get their \"assets\" out in order to get people in the door.

Get your tits out of my nachos.

On second thought, maybe the boobs would taste better than the duck."}
{"text":"I've been going here weekly when it was the Fox and the Fiddle and now as the gastropub for quiz nights. The beer and drinks are a good price and the events they have are fun.

However, the food at the fox and the fiddle was at best as good as food at a fast food joint, except bigger portions.

Thought when they changed to gastro pub they would have fired who ever did their cooking...nope.

Food now looks better but tastes just the same. 

The burger looks good but was bland the bun was way too big for the patty size and the fries were dry. Salad was OK but my vegetarian friend got a salad entry and said the lettuce was wilted. 

So far the poutine has been a safe bet.The only thing that has been improved is the plating."}
{"text":"Visited on Sat May 16, 2015 from 6pm to 11pm party of 25. I made my reservation a month prior when it was still a Fox and the Fiddle. They closed for a few weeks for renovations. They took out the carpeting, put in new hardwood floors and changed the interior decor a little bit. I have come a few times when it was the Fox and it looks fairly similar. The menu has changed significantly and it is only one page long. I ordered the Burrito Bowl which was quite good, waffle fries which were average and the combo appetizer platter which was really greasy. 

Service was a bit unreliable and spotty even though two servers were introduced to me. I was on the 2nd level overlooking the main level. There is an exposed server station right beside the tables which looked kind of messy. The servers finished their shift around 10pm and I had to close my bill which was a bit annoying as we were not done yet. 

The rooftop patio is open and overlooks Yonge st, beautiful view! It is partially covered as well. Lots of TV's to show sports games. I would come back again. Great for large groups. Hopefully they play UFC fights."}
{"text":"Went there last week with two friends for dinner at 7pm. We were escorted to the patio and noticed that it was not busy. It took exactly 20 minutes for a waitress to simply acknowledge us and come to our table. A couple arrived 10 minutes after us and were seen to first. 30 min after ordering our waitress came to tell us that they were \"out of our meal\"...why we didn't find out sooner is beyond it. At this point we had been there for fifty minutes and didn't have any food. We ordered something simple and it arrived 25 minutes later. The funny part was that we didn't even receive the correct meal but we're so hungry that we just ate it. They don't give us any cuttlery so I had to go inside and get some. None of us left a tip. We won't ever bother going back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a friend's belated birthday. Our group probably overwhelmed them a little bit as there was probably at least 30 of us in our mid twenties. But the bartenders were nothing but great! AT one point I ordered an Old Fashioned and the bartender apologized that he didn't have anymore bitters, but tried to make it up by offering other things. I was fine with just the whiskey. I wish I caught the guy's name at the bar because he was really really great!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout through SkipTheDishes. I literally only ordered two items--a lamb burger and a slice of apple pie--and they couldn't even get that right. I included a note asking for no sauce or condiments and no tomatoes on the burger, and they wrapped a tomato slice up with the lettuce, making it soggy and covered in tomato seeds. The apple pie, which was what I was most looking forward to, was missing completely!! The delivery service refunded my money for it, but why would I spend money on a meal from a \"nice restaurant\" if dessert isn't even going to show up? I might as well have gotten fast food and saved the money."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and chips - it was terrible. The fries were old and stale, and don't understand how they were allowed to be served. The fish was beyond mediocre, but not as bad as the fries. The service is fine. Go here if you need a place to hide a date and drink, but NEVER to eat."}
{"text":"My family and I used to go to This pub since we moved to Deer Park neighborhood, summer 2011. Unfortunately, from the day that it changed from Fox & Fiddle to Midtown Gastro, quality of food, beer, and place  dropped magnificently. Washrooms are dirty and broken. Food are awful, especially kids food. It seems Kids meals are made by leftover food, or hitted several times, specially fries. If you order Nachos, hardly find cheese on it. Last night I ordered a pitcher of beer for my friend and I. After that I asked for one more pint of the same beer. They charged me $23 for the pitcher, and $7.25 for the pint!!!! Which means a pitcher is more expensive than 3 pints!! 

I'm so unsaticfy with everything in this bar. Also I'm so upset how our favorite place to go, has changed in this way. It was a place that my son and I have had our birthday parties."}
{"text":"The best thing about this pub is the patio(s). There are two; one on street level and a roof top patio.

The street level patio is not large but is comfortable with nice shade. The pub itself is rather large. Draft beer selection is good. The food is at best bland, it wasn't bad but not good either.

I would go back again with friends on a nice day for the patio and beer but this is not a place for foodies. Many chains have much better food."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Midtown Gastro Hub on Yonge Street.   It was a warm sunny day and the patio was full so I sat inside.

I was craving wings and was happy to see that they were half price.  I ordered them with honey garlic sauce and dill ranch sauce for dipping my carrots.  The wings were okay.  There were eight to the pound and the price ($6) was right.

Amanda was my server.  She was friendly and  helpful.  It took a while for her to bring my bill after I'd asked, though.  I noticed an older woman was in the same situation and actually went up to Amanda to ask again for it.  I think it may have been because they were understaffed."}
{"text":"Please don't eat here. $15 cheeseburger? It's a frozen patty! $12 wings - frozen and breaded. Even with half price wings I feel cheated. No need to come here again.  May as well have stayed a Firken franchise. Too many other worthwhile options in the neighborhood to warrant a return visit."}
