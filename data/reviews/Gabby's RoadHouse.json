{"text":"I was in for lunch and what a shit show. The food was decent or at least what you'd expect I mean it is a gabbys. But it seems this location is different than others. It's a chain so I expect it should be consistent across the board, but my goodness the service was atrocious. Evidently there was a computer issue as paying debit was out of the question, which is fine, but the subsequent display of absolute contempt by the barmaid literally throwing the point of sale machine across the bar while yelling 'this is fucking bullshit' and subsequently slamming bottles and the bar around left most customers in shock. It seemed amusing to some so I can only assume they are regulars and are used to this kind of behaviour. At any rate while me and my lunch date were waiting while the barmaid who maybe is a day manager but is middle aged with bad highlights and glasses was either on the telephone making social calls or out smoking cigarettes. I used to work at a hotel so I know that customer service means not bringing your personal affairs to work and always doing what's right for the customer and keeping issues invisible. Apparently here that's not only acceptable but permitted. Either someone has been working here too long or there's no management oversight or both (I'm not certain whether gabby is a franchise or chain or each location is privately owned or...) but either way this one is desperately circling the drain.   Gabby is a good chain just don't go to this one."}
{"text":"One of two local bars in the mature yet trendy Yonge-Lawrence area.  It actually doesn't fit the area.  It's very dark inside, a thin walkway in the bar area and the washrooms were very dingy looking.  I haven't been to a Gabby's in quite a long time and I don't think I would like to ever go back again.  With the limited drink menu, it's not even worth going for drinks with friends.  It was a choice of my friend who lived up the street.   I'll stick to other choices for bars to the south."}
{"text":"So many other options around the area, and this place smells weird. Service wasn't bad though."}
{"text":"- it's a good local, grubby pub in the middle of a trendy shi-shi neighbourhood -aint nothing wrong with that. - do expect good atmosphere to watch a leafs game - dont expect great food."}
{"text":"We come to this place when a certain company comes and visit us as it's really close to our place. Our expectations are tempered as we come mainly for drinks. This place is more of a Dive than a Bar as the decor is dated and very dark in the inside. It doesn't give you a good vibe being inside. The last time we went there, the AC wasn't working so hopefully that issue has been fixed.   Typical bar food fare. If we have to eat here, I just go for the wings and fries combo as that is the safest choice and actually taste like its supposed too. I have tried the hamburger which was very dry and the triple decker sandwich which was very salty. Nachos are okay especially if you add beef. However, prices are not cheap either. Drink selections are not extensive but should have enough to keep you satisfied.   This place looks out of place in this area but they must be doing okay, as it has been here for a while.   Make sure to check their daily specials as it might make more sense in terms of prices.   I'm not a fan of this establishment but I have no choice in returning again.  Go at your own discretion."}
{"text":"Visited Fri Oct 28 for dinner party of 6 This was the original Gabby's location and been here for 30 years. Not sure why this place isn't packed. They were playing the Raptors game on the TV.   Pros Great location Yonge/Lawrence was why I chose to come.  Veggie burger was great and full of flavour.  The menu itself looks great, lots of info about the beers on tap.   Cons  The decor is a bit dated, the coin operated juke box in the corner didn't seem to work.  There were a few regulars who seemed to be hanging around the dark bar at the back. Not a very positive vibe.  No non-alcoholic beer available, this is a big trend for various reasons religious, pregnant mothers and those that are are the designated driver etc.  The regular fries didn't have much taste and could be improved.   Protip - They have a feature drink Mad Jack root beer."}
{"text":"There are better pubs in this area... keep looking. Gabby's interior has not been touched in more than 20 years. and In that time I have been a few times. Beers fine. Foods fine. Wait staff is pleasant. As a roadhouse style restaurant this one is an average neighbourhood pub."}
{"text":"The decor is ridiculous, it's dark as pitch, the drinks are swill, the music is loud and tasteless, the food even more so, the crowd that gathers sketchy and obnoxious and the washrooms are found after a perilous journey down winding stairs in the cold and drafty back end.   But it's a drive bar. What does one really expect. Service is pleasant and sometimes you just need a watering hole."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and dirty. I went to the washroom and saw where they store their food... I've worked in the food industry and I know what rotting food smells like and this was it!! Saw the kitchen on the way too, how does this place pass a health inspection??? When I got back to my seat I couldn't finish my drink and we left immediately."}
{"text":"50 cent wings on Monday and Wednesdays. Good place to go if you want cheap wings and want to watch some hockey and you just happen to be in the area. Otherwise, don't bother. Nothing here really blows your mind out of the water. The food is your typical bar food that you can find anywhere in the world. Not a fan of their pizza. They do have a rather large selection of burgers but once again, nothing that blows your mind away."}
{"text":"Its a pub, dont expect the world from it. You go here to hangout with some family and friends have some burgers, wings and drinks. Not for a fancy meal. Go to watch sports. My family and I go here pretty regularly. The one waitress who works there (now off for Mat leave) is amazing. She pretty much runs the place by herself. She memorized our drink orders, never let our glasses get empty, never had to wait for a drink, she is unbelievable and does it all on her own, and she has a great attitude. When we have gone before and she is not there, the service is not so great. Its slow, or glasses get empty, we have to wait awhile to order, she definitly makes the place 10 times better when she is there. The have great poutine, the cheese curds are awesome. If you enjoy pub food and beer I recommend Gabbys if you arent into the pub atmosphere id look for somewhere more upscale."}
