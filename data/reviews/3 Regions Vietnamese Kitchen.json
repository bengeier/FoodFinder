{"text":"Omg I'm Vietnamese and the food is definitely authentic and is home cook.  I love the bun bo hue(spicy noddle soup).  It is Much better than any places that I had before.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open for months and happened to catch it for dinner tonight on their opening day.  It's hard to have any reasonable expectations of a restaurant on literally their first day being open, but we were blown away at how awesome it was! Super good food at a reasonable price!  We had Hue's Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and the Grilled Beef Steak Plate.   Staff was very pleasant and on top of things for it being their first day.  Owner was super nice and spent some time talking with us about the place.  Looking forward to trying more from the menu. We'll be back!    P.s.  Try the Almond Panna Cota Jackfruit desert.  It was amazing."}

{"text":"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood! For those familiar with pho, you will definitely be delighted and for those not yet sure what to expect,  you will be wondering why it took you so long to have your first bowl of pho.  Our bellies were very full and we left with a big smile on our face."}
