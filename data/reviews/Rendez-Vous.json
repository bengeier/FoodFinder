{"text":"If you like to tray the real ethiopian food  I highly recommend Rendevous restaurant for the real deal!tray the special Tibs and vegetarian combination!you will be more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband as we were craving ethiopian.  We will definitely return! The server was friendly and the food was really good. The portions are a good size and prices are reasonable. We had the vegetarian sampler (came with many different offerings.. chickpeas, beans, salad, beets etc) and the beef stew as well. I loved the injera here as it was moist and delicious too."}
{"text":"I am Eritrean and Rendez-vous is a place I go to when I want to eat authentic home like Eritrean/Ethiopian food. Portion is generous, owner and staff are friendly, service is good but slow.  
 
I would recommend it, if you want to try Eritrean & Ethiopian food and be prepare to eat with your hands the traditional way."}
{"text":"Rendez-vous is located east of the popular Greektown Danforth strip in an area where lower rents enable modest independent resraurants to flourish. This comfy neighbourhood eatery caters to both Ethiopian expats and a growing coterie of people from other cultures who have come to appreciate the pleasures of ethiopian cuisine. 
Ethiopian dining is a communal experience where the food is served in small piles on a large edible shared \"plate\" of \"injera\", which is like a cross between a crepe and a large, soft crumpet. The eating utensil is another piece of folded injera, from which the diners tear off pieces which they use to scoop up fingerfulls of the various foods. As the meal proceeds, you eventually tear up and eat the injera plate too, which by then has absorbed the delicious juices left behind. 
We have a vegetarian son who now lives out-of-town, and we have made a trip to Rendezvous a tradition to celebrate his return home. We order a double order of their vegetatian combo plate plus extra orders of \"shiro wot\" (delicious slow-cooked chick pea dish served in a sizzling hot stone bowl) and \"gomen\" a spiced cooked kale dish. It's ample for a family of four and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We are Ethiopian  food snobs and normally run from restaurants that have American foolish offerings as well as those who feature large screen TV's but we will need to revise our criteria.  This place is remarkably delicious!
The service was stellar. The flavors were completely authentic. The injera was perfection.  Highly recommend the greens ( ours were spinach , not collards,) tibs both lamb and beef, doro wat and yes, tomato salad.  Terrific!  Coming back to Toronto again soon... Just for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went into our first ethiopian restaurant in toronto with high expections, as we did our research before and oh boy, we went home as the most satisfied and happiest people.
The service was slow, but friendly, so no complaints here.
My dinner arrived cold, but nevertheless it tasted amazing and our server was so friendly as to offer me some hot gravy which was DELICIOUS, so in the end I am kind of glad that my dinner arrived cold ;)
We will return again, soon I hope."}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan of this place.....the service a slow on busy days  could wait up to 40 minutes.......but the wait is worth it....its the most flavourful ethiopian restaurant I have been to.....the staff the friendly....and its so cheap...."}
{"text":"The food was great and not as greasy as I've come to expect of other GTA variations of Ethiopian cuisine. I won't name names. The variations of ingredients in the vegetarian combo was pretty colorful in appearance and flavour. The staff was friendly. Oh, and best of all, the tax was included in the list price of the food, which was a very pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I have tried several Ethiopian restaurants within Toronto and Rendez-vous has a cozy atmosphere (you are never rushed out), friendly service, and great flavours. 

I have tried the beef, lamb and vegetarian combo platter. All of the ingredients are fresh and the spices used makes everything tasty and flavourful. 

I highly recommend this restaurant for those who want a comfortable sit down place to have a drink (they open late) and/or a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  They were out of a few of the interesting drinks but the dinner was wonderful. Completely authentic. Casual, pleasant ambiance. Popular, but they take bookings."}
{"text":"Ordered wonderful meat platter and veggie platter. For 2 ppl, it was sooo much food. We were rolling outta that restaurant at the end of the evening. The food was excellent. Very tasty. Highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Quaint ambiance. You have to go in a group to share. If ordering vegetarian and non veg do specify to keep veg food separate if important to you. Been there twice now."}
{"text":"After this weeks UYE at Nazareth, which I could not attend. I have been dreaming of Ethiopian fare. Fast forward to Friday and I am begging the SO to take me to Ethiopian.

Unlike most Ethiopian restaurants, the food took a very reasonable 25 min to arrive at our table, and the server was checking on us often. We split a beef tibs (for him) and a Veggie platter for me. 

The food was just as good as last time with a WIDE variety of currys. Seriously we had at least 10 different tastes. We were stuffed silly with food left to spare.

Dinner for two with a beer, under $35 with tip. 

Our favorite in the east end (Danforth and Greenwood) options."}
{"text":"My first time eating Ethiopian and it was delicious. Went with a big group so we shared a large platter of food. Price was reasonable probably about 15 a person. And there were tons of food left over.
We ate with our hands using the soft bread, injera. So moist and delicious. It did fill us up quickly if you don't normally eat bread since they don't give you utensils to only eat the dish. I'm sure they'll provide some if you ask.
Other than that very flavourful dishes. Some of  them were quite salty is the reason I'd give it a 4. The next day a bunch of us felt quite bloated. But I'm sure the sodium levels in most restaurants are pretty high, especially vegetarian dishes. I like salty so I'm okay with it once in a while."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. It used to me one of my favourite Ethiopian restaurants. Now the food is blunt, old, cold, no longer tasty. The service is about the same, if you ask for the salad on the side, it won't happen."}
{"text":"You know, the neighbourhood is dreary looking. However, this restaurant is such a find. I love Ethiopian food, and managed to get some conversations in with my neighbours. It can be that kind of place."}
{"text":"Ok, my first ethiopian safari on the Danforth. Good food, vegeterian meals great, meat good. Unusual tastes that make you think of Africa, great beer from their country. I personally had one problem that spoilt the party a bit, this is just me but I could not reconcile with the bread sorry. It was cold, looked like a thin very big Porto mushroom. It was goowy and broke easily when in touch with food. My following analogy is purely an analogy no disrespect meant. To me it felt like those gels of shoe in-soles sold at Shoppers, the plastic packaging has a hole and you can feel the gel, in this case the wavy track type.
Good place worth checking out....."}
{"text":"Voulez-vous a food rendezvous in Little Ethiopia - Danforth?
I hopped off the subway at Greenwood station and made my way to this small but popular restaurant.

The simple signage outside is no indication of what you'll find once you open the door.  The warm red lighting and spicy aromas make you feel instantly cozy and extra hungry!  The decor is surprisingly resort like and ambient for such a small restaurant.

The menu had a lot of items, most of them are best for sharing.

Before we got to the food, we ordered honey wine, I'm not sure if it's on the menu, but the waitress recommended it.  It was a light wine with syrupy notes like ice wine.  A bit sweet to start, but enjoyable!

Back to the food.  
There were so many options for vegetarians and meat eaters.
Between the 4 of us, we split 3 items.

We shared the vegetarian combination platter and also ordered beef and lamb.
I'm don't know exactly what we consumed, it was a giant serving of stewed lentils, chic peas, kale, collared greens, and refreshing salad.

The spongy injera was was surprisingly light and pleasant tasting.
I've had it at other restaurants but it was more sour.
I preferred the injera at Rendezvous (less sour).

I broke a rule.  
I can only eat so much injera and I asked for cutlery so I could just eat stuff.  
...They were fine about bringing me a fork!

After the meal, they didn't have much for dessert but there's always coffee!
For a large group, the coffee ceremony is an awesome experience.
The coffee beans are heated in a iron pan and brought out to the table while smoking.  The coffee is poured and served with popcorn.  

The coffee wasn't as strong tasting as expected.  It reminded me of a chai tea because of the spices. 

I really enjoyed eating here!
The service was personal and attentive and the food was flavourful, filling, and everything was super cheap.  It was about $15 - $20 dollars each.

I would definitely bring friends here to try Ethiopian comfort food.
I wasn't sure if I fancied Ethiopian food, but Rendezvous changed my mind!"}
{"text":"a great introduction to the Ethiopian community and Ethiopian food. Half the customers (including us) get hugs from owner or staff, part of the great community feel of the place. It's easy to start conversations with people or have privacy. The food is great -- huge range of choice for vegetarians and very nutritious. wayne and lori"}
{"text":"We live just walking distance to this restaurant and have on past occasions only got take-out.  Eating in is a better experience.  It was very busy Thursday night and they could have had one more server.  Service was a bit scattered and slow.  It was ok with us since we were catching up with another couple.  Our friend tried to order a bottle of wine, but they said one was already open (masi) and that he could only have a glass.  Didn't get the logic in this considering he ordered two more glasses and they had to open another bottle, cost us more..oh well...

On to the food.  The order was.

Beef Tibs
Lamb Stew
Spicy Chicken
& the full Vegetarian Platter
Rice
Injera

When the food arrives it always looks like there isn't enough, portion control is heeded.   The spices are fantastic and not to hot.  The vegertarian dishes are great.  I still have to wrap my head around the Injera Bread, I don't really like that bloated pancakee mushy feel.  Abraham who was working the bar said they do have a bread more consistent with Naan will get that next time.  Can't give you total since friends picked up tab but I would say food was about $60....booze that's another story."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews... it's a quaint little restaurant with lots of character. It was my first time having Ethiopian food. Although I think the restaurant is great for Ethiopian food, I think it may be the cuisine itself that isn't my favourite. Don't get me wrong the food was good and I was EXTREMELY pleased with the service. They very much so went out of their way to make me feel special (it was my birthday).

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love the Cha-Cha, gomen and vegeterian combo dishes. Staff is friendly, and food is best Ethiopian I had in Toronto. Service can be slow at times, but for freshly prepared food, I am willing to wait."}
{"text":"Recommended by someone on Chowhound who knew more about Ethiopian food than I ever will. Food was so good my girlfriend fainted in the restaurant. Very friendly staff. 10/10 - Would come back again.

(Berbere chickpeas were amazing !)"}
{"text":"Came here for my mothers birthday, and everything was perfect. We had three vegetarian combinations, which was suitable for vegans as well, and a few meat dishes which were superb. One of the great highlights was also the traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony, which if you have never experienced before, let it be at this restaurant. Service is always friendly but not intrusive, and the decor is done with style. Came on a Wednesday evening and was pleasantly surprised to see several tables full, so clearly this is a number one spot for Ethiopian cuisine in Toronto. Located just around the corner from Greenwood subway also, so it's really easy to get to as well. Thanks to Banchi, the owner, for putting together a great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Yum! went on a Saturday night, it was busy so the service was slow. Chose a lamb, chicken and a veggie dish. Food came fairly quickly even though it was quite full in the restaurant. Very yummy!  I have had Ethipian before and this was quite comparable. Food was yum yum flavourful. Hard to get our bill as the waitstaff was run off their feet tending to all the other tables. Would I comme here again? You betcha! i understand that restaurants can be busy and that the staff does their best to tend to everyone. The food was super tasty and this is what will bring me back."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian platter in the east end. So fresh and flavourful. Comes with more selections than I have had at other restaurants. Not sure if the injera is the best though. I prefer a bit more sourness. 

Service is friendly. Favourite Ethiopian restaurant so far. I still have to master the art of eating with injera :)

Definitely get the coffee ceremony if you can but be prepared to get wired if it is just two of you."}
{"text":"We tried the  Rob Ford ( Kittfo) from the new candidates menu. It was grind beef mixed with home made herbs and butter with a lil bit spicy in it. It comes with cheese. You choose how you like it done. Everyone should try I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place: friendly service, good food and reasonably priced. Ethiopian cuisine seems quite hot, you better ask first how hot is the dish before choosing.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie platter, which was quite tasty, but there was a sizeable rock in my lentils. I know it happens, but it was off-putting."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto and I've been to at least a half dozen around the city so far. The service is the best and that's saying a lot for Ethiopian places. More importantly, the food is also the best I've found so far. It doesn't hurt that the who runs this business make a point to engage with their customers to get to know them and once you become a regular, you are treated very well. 

After getting married last year, we took my new parents in law to this place and when we walked in, the owners recognized me and asked how I was doing. I showed them my new wedding ring and they congratulated me of course. What really had this establishment shine was later in the evening, they surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne to celebrate our marriage. The timing couldn't have been better with my parents in law being with us that day."}
{"text":"I wish i could give these guys a 3.5 overall.  If I was to rate just the coffee and/or coffee ceremony I would totally give it a five *.  Once it started to get busy it was hard to get a waitress for service...although they are all very nice and sweet.  The was great too, but I prefer their competitor across the street!  I would totally check this place out again...great for coffee with friends!"}
{"text":"As an Eritrean woman who is very familiar with shared Eritrean and Ethiopian dishes, I can state without any hesitation that this is by far the best Ethiopian food I have ever consumed. The food was incomparable and the service was the best service I could have ever requested. The owner was wonderful and made sure her patrons were well taken care of. The decor was fantastic and made me feel as though I was right back in my native country. I highly encourage any visitors or Toronto residents to eat at this fantastic restaurant, you will NOT be disappointed. I'm speechless at the quality of the food, service and decorations at this restaurant. If I lived in the Toronto area, I would frequent this restaurant on a daily basis because the people who work there are so enjoyable and the food is so delicious. I cannot wait to return to Toronto, and Rendez-vous and the wonderful owner Banchi are a major reason for my desire to return. This restaurant is a must for any person who is a fan of Ethiopian food or is looking to try an assortment of delicious food. This is my new favorite restaurant, please go and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"My brother and I took my  dad here for his birthday last night. When we walked in it was very warm and welcoming. I have never written a review on a restaurant before nor have I ever tried Ethiopian cuisine. But I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Our server was extremely helpful and the setting was very authentic and made you feel like you were at home in terms of comfort. We ordered the vegetarian platter, chacha and grilled lamb tibs with onions and green and red peppers. DELICIOUS. Everything was nicely seasoned and the flavours were all very memorable in a good way. After letting our server know that it was my dads birthday, they brought over sparklers and a bottle of champagne which was nicer than the traditional slice of cake. I will definitely be back. Great food, great service and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait.

Seriously. If you're in a hurry, go somewhere else, but if you're looking to have a chill time with some friends, some killer food, then come here, sit back and relax.

Right out of the gate, order the coffee service for the end of the meal. It's a very cool way to end the meal. Who knew that popcorn and freshly roasted grounds were a match made in heaven?

After that, be creative and communal; it's the best part of eating here. The four of us ordered 5-7 seven \"dishes\" with our injera and they ranged from very good to excellent, though I was most impressed with the veggies dishes. So flavourful and so different.

Dinner for four was in the range of \"they must have given us the bill for that table of two\". Fab."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food I've had in the city and not too greasy either. The only downside is that their takeout option is noticeably smaller than their sit-in meal. I wasn't prepared for that."}
{"text":"This was our first Ethiopian food experience and it exceeded my expectations!

Restaurant is very cozy, clean, dimly lit with smells of incense. Service is adequate - friendly and professional, however, would have appreciated some more time spent in explaining the menus and how to approach the food when it arrived. 

Food was great! Ordered the veggie combo and the meat combo which was a perfect amount for 4 people to share. All the food comes out on one communal dish (as the photos show) and each person uses pieces of injera to grab and eat the food rather as cutlery. 

I would return. Prices are very fair and food is tasty and healthy!"}
{"text":"This is where I was told to go by my Ethiopian neighbour. Was not disappointed. 
Had their platters with a bit of everything. Loved it all. I've been to many Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurants and this is one of the best. The good ones can make you wait a while but that wasn't the case here. 
I dislike frankincense so I didn't get the coffee but I'm sure it's good."}
{"text":"My favorite Ethiopian restaurant. The service can be a little slow but the food is truly worth it! Try the Ethiopian beer if they have it in stock."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant with a lot of character and quite popular with the Ethiopian community in Toronto. 
The food choice is wide and the quality appears high.
Went there on a Thursday evening, there was live music that covered the normal Ethiopian music. 
We had Doro Wat and Zignie. The latter was very tasty and spicy. 
Service is slow, but I guess you go there to relax, not to have a fast dinner.
I really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"It seems to be understood that this is the most classical style of Ethiopian cuisine in this African stretch of the Danforth. What I can say from experience, is that it is my favourite in Toronto after trying several others around town. My favorite dish is the Lamb Tibs. Vegetarians are more than accommodated for, as my second favorite dish is the vegetarian platter, which comes with a huge variety of lentils, beet root, peas, potato etc. All prepared in their own unique sauces and spices. 


Very chill atmosphere with dim lighting, interesting african-pop music playing in the background."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood place you can't go wrong here.  Really great food and great service.  Get this: 7 people and our total was about $100 CD."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Ethiopian restaurant! I have tried both the veggie combo and the meat combo and both are great, however the veggie combo is my favourite. My favourite is the spicy lentil (?) dish in the  veggie platter. The portions are really good for the prices they charge, and more importantly, the flavours are amazing! I have eaten in, but more often, we call ahead for take-out. Nothing like feasting on Ethiopian food from the comforts of your own living room!"}
{"text":"After having read all the solid reviews, i have to say we were disappointed by rendezvous. my wife had the vegetarian platter, which was fine (altho i think the platter at Lalibela was a cut above). I had the doro wat (spicy chicken). While the dish tasted fine, there was only a single drumstick with the sauce and a soft-boiled egg, which was almost comical at $11.50. 
The really disappointing aspect was the lack of professional service. Although our server was pleasant, we never really saw her after we were served. Our water glasses were never refilled and my wife had to flag down another server to get more hot water for tea. It also took nearly 20 minutes to get the check, which no one ever picked up (we eventually paid at the register after another 15 minutes).
I certainly don't expect fine dining when i get Ethiopian food, but this was pretty disappointing from start to finish. If you value service and want to try Ethiopian, i'd have to suggest going across the street to Lalibela."}
{"text":"Huge portions for one with ample toppings and the injera in particular is so much larger in diameter and THICKER than what you can get downtown! 

I came here alone tonight to have a rendez-vous with food, my lifelong one true love. I love Ethiopian food, have tried a few different places in Toronto (all downtown so far) and in Philadelphia. Tonight I ordered the veggie (it's vegan!) combination platter for one ($13.99), which comes with 2 huge ass injeras and a dozen of toppings. To be honest, there's nothing more special about the toppings in terms of variety or taste here versus at other Ethiopian places I've tried so far. My favorite toppings were the collard greens (some may think it's bland, but I thought it was refreshing and less heavy so a nice change from the other chickpeas, potatoes, and beans-based toppings), something mildly spicy (maybe lentils or small beans?), and roasted beets! Very filling since you're eating plenty of carbs/starches (potatoes), fiber, and protein! Yes, Ethiopian food is so great for that protein and minerals + vitamins boost that vegetarians/vegans often need! Injera itself is made from teff, a whole grain that's loaded with nutritious vitamins, minerals like zinc, and protein. 

I ate everything by myself. Literally everything - both injeras in fact - and all the toppings. If you count calories, a vegetarian platter is around 1500 kcal (https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/nutrition/2013/11/07/the_dish_vegetarian_platters_healthy_ingredients_undone_by_salt.html). Anyways, I was sooo stuffed, center of mass definitely altered making the walk back home very interesting.

The one thing that sets Rendez-Vous apart from other Ethiopian restaurants I've tried so far is that the injeras are bigger and thicker. I'm not sure if they give free refills since I never asked, but I doubt you'll need any since the portions are so generous.

Relatively fast service. Not a lot of staff and the ladies are always on their feet, working fast. They do have outdoor seating, but the inside seating, particularly deeper inside, are so cool and cultural. 

They do take credit card. And free WiFi from the nearby Starbucks :P"}
{"text":"The food here is dy-no-mite.. The service is a bit slow, make sure you don't have anywere to go after.

It's about $14 per person but you get SO MUCH FOOD, my friend and I were stuffed.

We ordered the lamb and vegeterian and they bring you extra injera, should you need it... you won't. you won't be able to move after.
The lentils and whatever pured veggies were there were my favourite.

I wanted to get the coffee but I didn't want to be up all night.
They have a cute patio and ample seating.

Come hungry."}
{"text":"Very nice Ethiopian restaurant.  Nice and relaxing atmosphere. The ladies that worked there were very friendly and polite.   The food was excellent. Good prices. The  meat platter was very delicious. 
The coffee ceremony was wonderful and the popcorn was so delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the portions are deceiving. A large plate was put in front of 3 of us and we didn't come close to finishing it.  The atmosphere is also lovely and would be a great date spot but maybe not for a first date as you eat with your hands. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food is 5-star -- best Ethiopian in Toronto, except for the worms crawling in the fresh salad greens + the unripe tomatoes.(Keep tomatoes out of the fridge, then they'll ripen).

My beef is that I was a weekly customer for over a decade and that they made an error, didn't fix it + left me in the lurch. I can't believe how my loyalty was so easily dismissed + I've not been back.

The error had to do with the injera, which is traditionally made with gluten-free teff flour. Well, at some point they started adding wheat + barley to it. I explained that celiacs + GF peeps would come here because they had a GF-facility until that point. They didn't seem to care + continued to go down the road to get me teff injera. My last visit, they gave me the wheat added injeera after we specified for it to be teff only; I found out after I'd taken the order home to eat. I explained how dangerous that could be for celiacs but they just shrugged. No sorry, no interest, no replacement, no nothing.

It's too bad as I loved all the cooked dishes + they lost a loyal customer. I think they're in- person service manner may be much better than their utterly lacking phone customer service."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a place. Laid back restaurant but also could double as a sports bar.  We went for lunch when there was a soccer game on so quite a few people checking out the game.

The food is good - lots of flavours that just melt in your mouth.  We got the lentils which were yummy and had a nice citrus finish to them, spiced ground beef which was good and had a tiny bit of heat (we asked for medium spicy) and the lamb.  The lamb was my least fave only because I felt it was overcooked, but the flavour was there.

Ethiopian way of eating is shared eating - food comes on a huge plate and everyone shares.  There is a roti (not really but easiest way to describe it) that's soft and spongy to eat your food with.

I've heard the place can get packed in the evenings so best to make a reservation.  Close to the subway and plenty of street parking."}
{"text":"We had the vegetarian combo mixed with a beef dish. It was excellent, good for sharing and more that we could eat. Nice presentation, fast service and a decent price."}
{"text":"This is my fave Ethiopian resto.  Affordable, authentic, delicious - and in a repurposed Italian restaurant, so you get to ask the servers about the mosaic boot on the floor.  

The servers are consistently lovely, as well."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto for the first time and we had an amazing spicy Kitfo, cha cha cha (the best one) and spinach rib (tibse) was excellent!!! The service was outstanding by the very friendly servers and by the owner including Ethiopian coffee ceremony. Thank you Rendezvous making my vacation unforgettable by a great dinner with my lovely friends!!!

I highly recommended this restaurant who looking for best ethiopian restaurant and I will definitely stop by next time too"}
{"text":"Hidden in the east end of the Danforth, who knew there would be a little Ethiopian community?

The decor is definitely interesting. Although, the outside has lots of lights as decoration, the inside is kind of dark. The red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read.

The food is not bad. Although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing!"}
{"text":"It has been way too long since I've had injerra, so I may be just a wee bit excited at finding this place. Okay, a lot excited. 

I went with friends and their kids. We ordered the veggie combo, shiro wat, doro wat, and Derek tibs, and that was more than the five of us could finish off, although we all tried valiantly. 

I always order shiro wat and doro wat at any Ethiopian place. I fell in love with them when I was out there, and the Rendez-Vous does them right. In fact, everything was great. 

Unfortunately, we didn't have time for the coffee.

Our server was polite and helpful without being intrusive. It took a while for the food to be prepared, but, you know, this ain't McDonald's. Injerra is never going to be a fast food. (Although we did joke about injerra and wat burritos...)

I'm looking forward to checking out the rest of the Ethiopian places in town for comparison, but already, Rendez-Vous is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Received take-out from ubereats. Tried the doro wat and vegetarian combo. Both were absolutely delicious and very flavourful. I've never had Ethiopian cuisine before so I cannot compare to any other places but I thoroughly enjoyed and would definitely return to the restaurant to get the entire experience !"}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food I've had in the city! Doro wat was amazing! Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast here."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple of years ago it was below average for me they got the name on the reservation wrong it looked like everyone in the restaurnat was high there was a weird array of odour that I didn't like. I ordered some lamb curry they gave to much bread and it took them 26 to 30 minutes to make coffee which was ridiculously expensive I probably won't come here again"}
{"text":"This was indeed a very very nice place - it was clean, the decor was nice (we had round tables), and the food was nice (super spicy) - also - it was cheap. The place is really really slow though - incredibly so - we were there middle of the day and it was practically empty when we got in and it took an hour to get our food. The price made up for it - 40 bucks with tips (20%) for food for four adults, 1 glass of wine and 1 soda. 3,5 stars is what we want to give. Keeffaa Ethiopian  was just SO much better all around and we kept comparing it to it - and it is not just 1 star less, it is two. 
but it was fun and nice of course - but Keeffaa had much better food really..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Ethiopian food for the first time in Toronto.  Being a big fan of Ethiopian food I opted not to try the combination platters and instead went straight to my favourite foods: shiro and doro wat. Shiro is a thick spiced chickpea purée and doro wat is an extra spicy stew with chicken and a hard boiled egg. The shiro at Rendez-vous was just ok for me. It was flavourful but just didn't hit the spot in the way shiros in my past experiences (in Ethiopia of course) did. The doro wat on the other hand was delicious. I could have more of that! My only complaint would be that it was just a tiny amount of chicken on the stew. I know, I know. The sauce is the best part anyway!  Oh and mmmmm injera...
I need not make comments on how good that stuff is! 

This place was recommended as a good date night spot.  It was nicely decorated with traditional looking tables and dim red lights. However, we were seated so close to our neighbours that we might as well have been a group of six.  Staff were super nice. Service was not as slow as people have mentioned. 

Overall a 3.5 if I could!"}
{"text":"Get the chicken tibs, and the lamb tibs. Their beef was okay. Whatever you do get the chicken tibs !!"}
{"text":"I love this little joint! The food is always incredible - I've never had a bad dish. The alcohol list is also pretty extensive, and I love that they carry divey-bar beers like Molson Ex, as well as higher end imports, depending on your mood. I find the dishes to have the right amount of spice as well - nothing overpowering, and adding to the flavour, not just hot for the sake of hot.

One bonus - I took my boyfriend for his birthday. When they found out, they played a cheesy birthday song over the PA, brought us a comped bottle of sparkling wine with sparklers, on top of a tray with heart candles. It was really sweet and totally unexpected, and really made our night. It's rare to find service like that in this city."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and the people are crazy nice.

My sister and I came to have dinner here. It's really dimly lit. There is a bar area to your left when you walk in and sitting space to the right. There was a range of people from different backgrounds. Everyone is welcome. The table beside us ad a group of people having a business meeting. The other table had teens enjoying themselves over selfies. They offer wet naps to clean your hands with before and after food. 

The food is awesome! I've never had Ethiopian food before but this was soo worth the wait. The food range from mild to extra spicy. Be sure to ask your sever if you can't handle heat. 
It's most def a place I would return to without a heartbeat. OHH and a whole bunch of food for $35 tax included for three people. Ahh, what a bargain."}
{"text":"I saw someone post a blog about this place so I thought I'd check it out after a beach day. Full disclosure, I'm a total west end snob and don't really go east of Pape all too often, sad but true. That being said, I'll definitely be making the trip out east again and again for this place. The vegetarian platter was so good. Great flavours and this is probably going to be my new favourite Ethiopian place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is fantastic- we tried the vegetarian platter and dry beef tibs - the portions were huge, we couldn't finish it (despite really wanting to!) the atmosphere is unique, low lights and Ethiopian decor. Can't wait to go again,"}
{"text":"Our favourite Ethiopian restaurant on this strip of the Danforth. I always order the vegetarian platter and it's delicious; my partner likes the Doro Wot and the Alicha Wot."}
{"text":"My first Ethiopian experience was Ah-May-Zing!

 I was at first pretty skeptical about the experience when I walked in, the red lit room isn't the most comforting setting. I'm glad I went with someone who was raised by the Ethiopian culture so I didn't walk in blindly.

There are photographs of traditional Ethiopian people half naked everywhere on the walls. The counter and bathroom looked like a bamboo hut..

There are different meats  you choose from a long with vegetables. We felt adventurous so we went for the combination meat and veggie plate. 

Minutes later, Our server brought a BIGGGGG pan with 4 different stewed meat, and 6 vegetable stew surrounding the meat.  Along with a big sour dough crepe.

Get ready to take your taste buds on a roller coaster ride!! All the different stews are made in different intense sauces you don't remember the taste of the lash dish. None of them were tooooooo weird where it grossed me out.

I'm glad I can say I've tried and cross one more item off my adventurous eat list !"}
{"text":"Rendez-Vous is amazing! The decor is very traditional and the lighting is low.  I like going there with my husband or close friends just cause we can all share a huge plate.  The food is sooooooo cheap.  Its also nice that its not a huge franchise restaurant because coming hear makes it feel more like a genuine Ethiopean restaurant! Love it and I would def recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Ethiopian food for quite some time and this place did not disappoint. We shared the vegetarian platter and it was delicious. Plenty of food and so affordable. The atmosphere was simple and cozy. A nice mix of people who looked like regulars and those like us who were there for the first time. The staff were very pleasant and attentive without being too much. Very relaxed. I'd highly recommend this place and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Rendez-Vous serves Ethiopian food that's edible; it's not bad and it's not great.

We ordered a meat combo and a vegetarian combo.

Meat combo came with 3 meat dishes. I enjoyed 2 of them more: the minced beef & the meat chunks stewed with onion. The 3rd meat dish was stewed and the meat was overcooked.

Most of the vegetarian dishes were bland.  I liked the greens (gomen) the most.

The injera was mixed. The first pieces of injera we got was made from mixed flour & softer in texture. The second set of injera was much more dry.

Service is so-so. It was difficult to get water.
Bar/restaurant is on the noisy side."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, wait was a bit long but service was great. Had the Doro Wat (chicken) and veggies everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Who knew there was a neighbourhood in Toronto called \"Little Ethiopia\"? Not this girl. Well, if you head over to Danforth/Greenwood you'll come across it - a smattering of Ethiopian restaurants that will give Nazareth, Ethiopia House and M&B Yummy a run for their money. If you didn't also know, at last count there were over 11,000 Ethiopians living in Toronto.

The food is dirt cheap. Like, a ridiculous amount of food that you can scarcely finish between two people for $13. This particular Ethiopian restaurant isn't strictly vegetarian (like M&B Yummy) but they do have a vegetarian platter with about ten items on it (six menu items plus whatever extra stuff they have kicking around in the kitchen that particular night) for $13 with ample servings of injera. Tonight we feasted on shiro wot (chickpea), missir wot (red lentils), cabbage stew, potatoes, collard greens, tomato salad with fresh ginger dressing and four other lentil concoctions. 

The decor is pure Club Med, and so is the kickass music that soundtracked our meal. There are straw, hut-like coverings for each hourglass-shaped table, and the lighting is unusual (all of the lightbulbs are red). There's a lot of palm tree art -- apparently there are palm trees in Ethiopia? And the music...oh man. I felt like I was at a Hawaiian lagoon."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Ethiopian food. I had the vegetarian pattern which had many different samples. The dead animal eaters at my table were also satisfied. The portions are pretty large. Service was friendly and fast. Very quiet restaurant, both due to the low volume music and pleasant guests."}
{"text":"Very good place to enjoy a meal here. The environment is good, put u in the exotic place to enjoy food. The food taste good and also authentic, although the hot source is not spicy enough. The restaurant opens for 16 years already and deserve have a try. Waitress are very hospitality. The only con is a little bit over-priced, otherwise, all good. Will go again."}
{"text":"I came here for 11:00AM but there was no one in the front to seat us and after about 10 minutes I went to the back to look for the waitress/hostess.

I didn't know what to order but from the reviews on yelp my friend and I ordered a vegetarian and meat platter which ended up being $19.20 for each of us. When the food arrived after about 20 minutes my friend and I couldn't believe our eyes, there was so much food! We had enough to take home a good amount between the both of us. I loved the lentils and the different types of meats, two of them were spicy and so flavourful! I had the leftovers later today and they were still pretty good. Eating without utensils was an interesting experience but fun! If you're looking for good and flavourful food, come visit Rendez-Vous!"}
