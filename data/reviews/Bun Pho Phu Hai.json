{"text":"I have eaten my fair share of Pho in my lifetime. I have to admit I'm not particularly adventurous and often stick to a few well known establishments (Vic Hong, Kim Po and the like). Sometimes you just need a hot bowl of noodles to fill you up!   I came across this little place in the plaza next to Vaughan Mills mall one day. I thought to myself, sure, why not give it a try.   What I found great about this place was that everything tasted very \"home made\". It doesn't feel like mass produced food like the other Pho restaurants. The beef broth was piping hot and full of beef flavor, and the noodles were cooked just right. The shrimp was well cleaned and no veins in sight!!! That actually impressive me quite a bit! The vegetables (bean sprouts, shredded carrots and cucumbers) are neatly tucked in the side of the bowl and tasted very fresh. Wow..what a great bowl of Pho!   I think this place is a great find. Prices are great and the lady at the counter is always nice and friendly. The place is kept pretty clean as well!  Usually you see pushing carts with dirty dishes sitting in a corner but not this place.   Also I recommend ordering drinks from the menu. I always ordered the Mango milk shake and man, was that good! It is made fresh, tastes like mango, not some artificial mango flavouring. I have yet to try their bubble tea but trust that it will be great as well.   If you feel like a hot bowl of Pho in winter days come to this place. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This restaurant we have been there for many times.  The soup for the noodle is very good.  Not like other Vietnamese that has lot of MSG.  We prefer the Pho noodle soup than the \"Mei Tall\" noodle soup (pork and seafood).  While we are having our meal, the waitress, probably the owner, mops the floor.  When I look at the mop, it is dark grayish and very dirty.  It certainly reduces my appetite in eating.  It should definitely be improved."}
{"text":"Why do I love this place?  The food is fresh and tasty. They do not skimp on great ingredients that makes the food taste authentic.  None of those vermicelli noodle fillers on their Fresh Spring roll.  Just succulent shrimps, mint leaves and other ingredients, which I trust makes it wonderful.  The place is quiet at night and the prices are inexpensive.  This is my go to place when I want Vietnamese food that is quick and great.  I had the Pho with Rare Beef and tendon, which was flavourful and generously meaty.  I have also had the Shrimp stir-fry with Vegetables and Cashew, which made me feel both healthful and indulgent since the portions they gave me were plentiful, filled with my favourite veggies and again no skimping on the tender shrimps.  They also have a smoky Grilled Beef platter that just made my mouth water because of the lovely glaze it had, without looking too fatty.  The achar that was its side was clean tasting and fresh.  Therefore, if you need a tasty, quick and cheap place to eat authentic Vietnamese food where you will enjoy a quiet meal then this is the place to go.  (In retrospect, maybe I should not have said anything because that \"quiet\" criteria may no longer be applicable.)"}
{"text":"When I'm in the area and I'm craving Pho ( Vietnamiese soup) I ususally go to Pho 99 in the next plaza, but one Sunday afternoon I went to try out Bun Pho Phu Hai with my family and some friends.   The waitresses were friendly and the food was very tasty, the variety is quite large so you can get chicken fried rice, spring rolls etc. they have a huge menu and almost anything you can imagine from pork to duck. Whatever your palate desires.  The only complaint we had was that they got our orders mixed up and then the girl was trying to convince my dad that what he got was what he had ordered...that kinda pissed me off...you would KNOW what you ordered as a customer..lol...anyway. They finally took the hint and gave him his plate and then the rest of dinner went smoothly.  oh and a little hint when they give you the check..you have to get up and go pay at the counter. They are open til 10 pm..and they take debit, visa and mastercard."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my parents. .  Portions are great...my parents found the large quite \"large\" and was able to share it. The soup was very fresh...feels like not much msg (which I like).  Service was attentive.   Overall much better than the ones I have tried downtown toronto."}
{"text":"First thing I came in to notice is CP24 on display top left corner at the back on top of the doorway to the back.  Saturday Lunch there were already 5 or so tables as I notice families and rugged contractors have their lunch but all Asian decent.  I can't BELIEVE Jen K. got the FTR on my home turf!!! She did something GOOD though as you should notice one of my photos will display a LUNCH SPECIAL valid Mon - Thurs 11am - 3pm which basically looks like a free pop to a regular price.  I looked at the special and quickly felt DISAPPOINTED as it doesn't include Saturdays but I went for the Medium House Special Pho.  The broth was light and fresh tasting and barely any oil in it.  Although the broth was a good change to other salty/oily ones elsewhere, the Pho noodles themselves were a bit soft and even with my years of Chopstick usage.  The service is friendly however the delivery of the food took longer than I'm used to.  The raw beef came in smaller slices and was cooked before I can start chewing on them.  It came with HALF a Beef Ball, so I'm not sure where the other half went, and it came with a small piece of Tendon.    Don't get me wrong, I still had a good meal as I sweated and steamed from the super HEATED broth that I almost finished.  My friend had some kind of Beef and Rice dish that looked good too and he liked it knowing he's hard to satisfy unfortunately.  I let him have a 2 minute head START, not because he eats slow or I eat fast but because his dish came before mine.  If you can't read the FINE PRINT on the Lunch Special photo... It says $5.00 Pho only apply to small.  For M, L, XL, please add 0.50, 1.00, 1.50 respectively."}
{"text":"Bun Pho Phu Hai is at a Plaza right across from Vaughan Mills. How I end up in this restaurant?? Of course because of Yelp! Yelp makes me go to different restaurant to yelp about them and what is better to get the honour of FTR!  This place is clean and spacious. I was welcome by the friendly waitress with a big smile. The menu is written in English, Vietnamese and Chinese so you will have no problem picking what you like to eat!  I ordered a small Pho ($5.00) and small Shredded Pork Roll ($3.50).   I am so glad I order the small Pho because it is the size of Medium of other Pho joint. The noodles though is dried tasted prettly good. The soup is quite flavoured not too salty however no star ansie was used.  The Roll though I found it a little dry... but still quite tasty.  The service here is prompt and friendly and the price is reasonable. No Lunch Special though.  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
