{"text":"This was a nice spot for a brunch with friends. The tables were a little small for the large plates they had. The food was good. Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"So here's what to expect: walk in around 1 pm, (sure it's a waffle place and typically more desirable for breakfast, but they serve lunch waffles) and I was the only customer, alongside 4 female employees SITTING around. I choose to sit outside, where I was handed a dirty menu. By dirty I mean pizza sauce fingerprints. Gross. If there are four bored employees, this would be the last thing you'd expect to see. Great first impression. I ordered a coffee and water, when she asked 'with ice?' Is it just me or is that an odd question to ask? Anyways, I decided to order both sweet and savory, so I ordered the original, that states on the menu 'with whipped cream OR powdered sugar' so I said with whipped cream and she said 'it comes with both' ok, menu flaw, whatever. And the combination pizza that clearly states 'with sausage, peppers, and onions' so I ordered that without onions. when delivered, my pizza waffle had mushrooms..wtf? That one didn't even come with mushrooms. Not sure if it was a server or chef error but I was unpleasantly surprised, but I just picked them off. AS FAR AS THE TASTE: look, I know restaurants and I know food, I'm not a snob, I've just been around the block. The waffles are dense, waffles shouldn't be dense, they should be light and fluffy, but the batter was so thick and heavy it was hard to keep eating. Also a tad overcooked, which probably goes hand in hand with the thickness of the batter. The same batter was used for both, which wasn't horrible for the pizza but not good for a sweet classic waffle. And the syrup...tasteless. Syrup is so important and I was so disappointed. Not entirely sure why a place that specializes in waffles, hasnt mastered the waffle. Again, I went here with so much excitement and an open mind.  Didn't exceed my expectations...didn't even meet them :( two stars for the concept because the concept has so much potential, but not quite ready for the public."}
{"text":"I cannot wait until this place is out of business and I put something better in its place. Horrible customer service. Disgusting and limited coffee condiments. I purchased 2 Groupon coupons, the first time they accepted it without a problem, the food was ok, but coffee was terrible, but still left a decent review on Groupon. The second time the customer service was horrible, I stood there for 5 minutes b4 anyone acknowledged me.  I proceeded to order and presented my Groupon. They said they are no longer accepting those Groupons, and made me feel like crap for trying to use a coupon. The most disturbing part is that not only did the guy lied to me about them cancelling the Groupons it is actually still up on groupon.com for sale. They are dishonest and I don't understand why you would turn away any business from an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Before they moved. 

Why would you change the menu? Crepe used to be good. Now it's a cold plain crepe?

Before this place was 5 stars. Way to go"}
{"text":"Waffle bar was soo yummy! We had to wait for our food for 10-15 minutes, but that ended up being totallyyyyy worth it! I got the banana waffle with cookie butter....my boyfriend and I ended up fighting over the last piece. He got a ham egg and cheese crepe and that was delicious too! Perfect Saturday snack!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was good, small but good atmosphere. The breakfast menu is good and fair in price, I liked it better than the dinner menu (I was there twice) good service, attentive and ready to help. Only opportunity is that the restaurant close earlier than advertised one night. Closing time was 10 and we should up at like 8:50 and they were getting ready to leave. The cook did offer to get everything started again and cook for us but it would have taken longer than."}
{"text":"This place is seriously everything you can ask for! I came in for breakfast and was so surprised with how much I loved their Breakfast Sandwich. It hit all of the right spots for my morning cravings! But looking at the menu, there are so many options I cannot wait to try.

It's incomparable how amazing the Belgian waffle is. They must have a secret recipe that I would love to get my hands on!

10/10 will be coming back here every time I stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very bad service. The food is in the table and still no Silverstein to eat the food with . After 20 minutes of sitting down, my husband had to go and ask for someone to come and get our order ."}
{"text":"Waffles themselves are outstanding. They are crispy, chewy and delicious. Just a few things off. Ordered a 2 egg breakfast for my kids with bacon. The bacon was browned on one end only, and the majority of the rest was cold and the fat was all white like it never hit the griddle. Basically raw. Instead of bringing some new hot crisp (or at least cooked) bacon, they elected to take the plate and bring it back after warming it up, still not crispy. In the mean time, the eggs and potatoes got cold. Didn't provide spoons when coffee was served, had to request them. Illy coffee is great, but cups were barely 2/3 full, way more room than needed for cream. Is the coffee too costly? They were not that busy, but everyone seemed like they couldn't handle the crowd. They have a ton of staff, shouldn't seem flustered. I would have given them 2 stars if the waffle wasn't so good. Seems like they need better management and training. I expect a little more from them."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to the waffle bar for breakfast and it was absolutely awesome!! The waffles are made fresh to order and the fruit is very fresh. We ordered the the strawberries and banana waffle. It is plenty to eat as the portion is large."}
{"text":"Having lunch at the Waffle bar with my mom. She had purchased a Groupon and we got here and ordered this awesome Brie grilled cheese with bacon brie cheese mushrooms on top of a waffle. Came with a choice of either waffle fries or side salad we split it and still had coupon leftover. And we'll still be taking home leftovers. Grilled cheese was amazing service also amazing restaurant clean smells good when you first walk in a definite thumbs up. My recommendation is high okay back to eating."}
{"text":"Still not a good review, however it was made clear to me by another \"Yelper\" that I should've posted pictures.  Didn't think of that and thank you for the comment.  I will be sure to post pix in the future to backup my rating."}
{"text":"Love Love Love. It's located in one of my favorite shopping centers. And not too pricy but if you are looking for great food and don't want to take home leftovers and you want breakfast and lunch or breakfast and dinner his is the place to be. The waffle I ordered was the perfect  combination of crispy and soft. 10/10 recommend. Service is great and so is the music."}
{"text":"Over all this place was ok. It was nothing special. They weren't busy on a Saturday afternoon yet out food took longer to come. My bf had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and over cooked, waffles are a little sweet so you don't need to add more syrup. I had the grille cheese waffle with Brie, mushroom and bacon. I thought it was ok was too much cheese and I love cheese just over power everything else on the place just doesn't cohesively come together for me. Waitstaff was friendly so that's a plus. Over all it was an ok place."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. Our server was friendly and explained everything to us as this was our first visit. We were very hungry so I ordered the 2 egg breakfast and my husband got the chicken fried steak with a waffle. We didn't wait very long for our meal to be brought out. The food was pretty good. The potatoes are made in house and seasoned nicely. My husband said the chicken fried steak was ok but the eggs over medium were cooked perfectly. My eggs over hard were a little over cooked with parts of the whites being inedible. The waffle was fantastic! Definitely the star of the meal. We will go back to try some of the specialty waffles they have."}
{"text":"We found this place on a local Instagram. The Waffle Bar was a great experience. Really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza, and the philly cheese steak my SO ordered. The chicken tenders for the appetizer were AMAZING. Oh, and the service was great. Our waitress was the best. Definitely a spot that must be checked out!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and used a Groupon with no issues. The staff was friendly and the good was okay but nothing to rave about. Nice bite to eat if you're in the area but probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"For food alone, I probably would have given two stars, unfortunately.

The service here is very solid. The waitstaff is friendly. The food is a little slow to come out.

We were the only people in here. We were here for an hour and a half. Not a soul came in in that time.

I ordered the pizza waffle with fries. The waffle is still very sweet. I love sweet waffles but not when it's also a pizza. It was way too sweet. The sauce was super chunky and also sweet. I was not a fan. The waffle fries are great.

This restaurant is also very overpriced. 

I'm sorry, but I'll stick to tiabi."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. Ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken is from the freezer, and not actual strips of chicken breast. The waffle was nice, very dense, but tasty. Pretty expensive. Breakfast for three would have been $50 if I hadn't used a Groupon."}
{"text":"So I just wanted a plain waffle with butter and maple syrup, to have while I was walking around the Farmer's market.  Simple enough, right?  No so much.  First, this place is overpriced for what you get, which is just one medium sized waffle that tastes only slightly better than an Eggo from a box that's been hanging out in your freezer for two months.  Service was cheery but slow.  I watched in mute frustration as the guy took my hot waffle from the iron and then let it get cold on the counter as he (at glacial speed) put the napkin, silverware, and butter and syrup in the to-go box.  Let's talk about the butter and syrup.  The \"butter\" was Country Crock margarine (gross), in a tiny tub.  The \"maple syrup\"  was some sort of cheap toxic corn-syrup crap from another tiny plastic container.  This is totally unacceptable food quality for a place that claims to specialize in waffles!  Go instead to the Coffee Pub on Sahara, a local's favorite.  Best waffles in town!"}
{"text":"No silverware, had to commit felony to eat my food hat arrived late along with smoothies that took 7-8 business days to arrive, no syrup was present at our table. The water tastes like it was scooped from the toilets. I am still awaiting the arrival of one of my dishes. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"So to start this off strong if you have the time and or patience to wait for a simple liege waffle with bananas then fine... But seriously it does not take 40 mins to make 2 waffles with one having a berry mix and the other with bananas and at most maybe 6 tables the entire time we where here. 

The waffles were ok at best... My girlfriend's berry waffle was good but the banana waffle was waaay too sweet, i understand that a liege waffle is glazed and is brioche but serve it with something salty to balance.

The staff was nice but how do you just run out of stuff on a sunday and it being Dr Pepper at that."}
{"text":"We were so caught off guard by this place especially since I'm not a big waffle fan, but I've been converted today! I will only eat my waffles here! My toes are curling up as I eat this messy madness! We had the Brie cheese with bacon and mushrooms! If it had a over easy egg, crab and shrimp I would try to be here everyday, and to think we almost passed on this spot for Echo and Rigs"}
{"text":"Great waffles other than the long wait , I have no other issue... There are quite a few customers and it appeared that there was only one  server at the time we were there ( there were other staffs present though ) , however  the server remained nice and patient.. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Omg not only is the waffle Amazing but the service is Great. Maury goes above and beyond, he gave us alittle history about our waffle and when he said they're GOOD he wasn't lying they're amazing.  I will definitely come back and I hope to see him again."}
{"text":"Mmmm! Came here with my hubby today after eating brunch. We ordered the Nute Waffle ($7.99). These are Liege style waffles. Being from Belgium, I can really appreciate these! It was a good sized waffle cooked to perfection. Sugar chunks, Nutella, and powdered sugar! Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend. She would gove it a 3-star but I would give it a 5-star. She had a fruit crepe and I had a caesar salad. The crepe was a bit cold and the friit was beginning to turn, but it was still enjoyable. My caesar salad was enjoyable. The service and atmosphere was very relaxing and the prices were affordable, 7$ for the salad and 9$ for the crepe.

I would come here again."}
{"text":"Took over 25 minutes to get our order, despite the place being almost empty. There were only two other tables and one of them left over how long it took their food to arrive. The server was nice and so was the food, so I guess the blame here goes on the kitchen for how long it took for our food to be made."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this place! The staff is very friendly & welcoming and the place itself is comfy and clean. Their liège waffles are so good -- definitely worth it!! I definitely recommend their chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Decadent waffles!! Tried the banana waffle with Nutella. It was amazing. As a baker, I'm tough on judging sweets. The sugar used in the waffles added a special texture. Looking forward to going back for lunch one of these days. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here with my brother for breakfast. We got the chicken crepe and the egg with cheese and ham. It took 5 minutes  for the woman to take our order. After working all night, I would have appreciated her taking our order and letting us have a seat. There was only 1 party of 2 that already had their food.
On to the food. $9 is too much for these thick pancake of a crepe. The inner ingredients were fine, but the crepes were gummy. Maybe the waffles would have been better..."}
{"text":"Great meal! Parking can be a little tough some days at Tivoli, but getting to the place isn't too bad. Price wise you are looking at $8-12 for a waffle (sweet or savory) which is pretty great as really all of them are filling enough per person. We went with two savory and one sweet waffle choice to test things out and came away pretty impressed. The only real struggle came from the service, for a smaller place with several people working the coffee cups sat cold a little longer than expected and getting the check took a good 10-15 longer than expected. The food though was great and worth a trip in to try the wide variety of flavors!"}
{"text":"Staff wasn't too welcoming but my Nutella waffle was amazing, a tad bit over priced. But good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and very happy we did. My friend and I shared the chicken & waffles  and the Bri/bacon sandwich. The chicken & waffles was great and The Bri/bacon \"sandwich\" was out of this world!! The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating for any of our requests."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food and awesome service! Went for breakfast with my wife and we both were very satisfied! I asked for an omelette  (that you can customize) and could tell their ingredients are somply top quality. Coffee is good too... And since the name mentions a waffle... had to ask for it too. Simply delicious. You've gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"We took my grandkids for brunch and were sadly disappointed.  I can say the waffles tasted good but at around $10 and up for one, they are way over priced.  I ordered an \"omelet\" but had to send it back.  It was so overcooked, it was dry, the cheese tasted terrible.  It was hard as a rock.  I sent it back and took my grandson to the restroom (we had to leave the restaurant to use a public bathroom for Tivoli Village - a little strange but the bathrooms were clean, but we couldn't get back to the restaurant through the door we left, we had to go around to the front door to get back to our table).  While we were in restroom apparently the chef was furious I sent back the food and argued with the waitress about taking it off our bill and it was only because they thought we would write a review because we used a Groupon did he relent and took it off the bill.  The best waffle was the cinnamon roll waffle.  The boys enjoyed their hamburger but we asked for well done and it was pink in the middle.  They completely forgot one of my boy's burgers and told us it wasn't because they forgot but because they can only cook one burger at a time.  So had their food but him, not okay.  We won't be back. Chef is rude and can't cook.  The waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"We were walking bay with our 2 small children and thought sure this will be fine for lunch.  It was!! It was great super yummy really fresh food with excellent flavor.  I was surprised how everything was so fresh, yummy and fancy without being too fancy.  Now, I will say it took some time to get our food out.... BUT went you are actually making delicious food from scratch, it takes time.  They brought crayons over for the kids and even a little snack which was very thoughtful.  Great coffee too!! I would recommend and will be going back again."}
{"text":"My first trip here 2 months ago was 5 stars. Today zero. Sign and web says they're open at 8am. I arrived with relatives who are visiting at 10am. They were closed!  

Call before you go!!!!!!!! Make sure they are open!"}
{"text":"We came here today around 1 or so. There was one couple in there... but many stores were slow so I didn't think much. 2 of our party just wanted some ice cream. The other wanted a cappuccino and a waffle. The one guy behind the counter apologized and said it would be a few minutes since he was new. Ok no biggie there's not many other people here. Well in 10 min he finished up an order. Turns out it's for the other couple (whom I thought were finishing up a meal with coffee. Not waiting for food) it took at least 10 more minutes for the one waffle and coffee to come out. I kinda feel like \"a few minutes\" should be clearer and more like \"15-20 minutes\". 
Aside from the dreadfully slow service the waffle tasted overly yeasty. The space is also huge, with a huge staircase which led to something much more satisfactory as many people were entering the cafe to go up.... kinda odd in my opinion... 
there's nothing here worth going back for me."}
{"text":"My daughter had the Nutella and banana crepe with fresh whipped cream, I have the salmon and cream cheese crepe came with French-fried potatoes and my son had the chicken and waffles we loved it all"}
{"text":"Tried to go eat there during business hours and the front door was locked. The guy motioned me to go around. So I tried the other door, it was locked as well. Went back to the front door and he still insisted that I needed to go around. 

So I went upstairs and looked all around for another entrance. Walked around for about 15 mins. Gave up and walked back. 

The guy then came to the door and opened it and eventually after a long conversation with him he finally said they were actually closed and if I wanted to go to another restaurant that I needed to go upstairs. then said their upstair door was closed as well. Wtf? I wanted to eat at the waffle bar, not another restaurant. Duh. 

He could have saved me a lot of heartache if he had just explained that from the beginning. That they were closed during their normal business hours. When I went it was 6:00 pm and supposedly they are opened til 8 pm. 

I will not be coming back. Luckily I was still able to catch the tail end of the restaurant next door's happy hour. 

He didn't even apologize for the misunderstanding. I left being quite irritated by the whole ordeal. 

Yep. Yelping. For. Sure."}
{"text":"Don't expect to get what you ordered. All I wanted was a plain waffle. That's what I ordered. What did I get? A waffle drenched in 3 different sauces and syrups. Yuck. No thanks. They acted like I was nuts that I wanted a plain waffle and not one covered in powdered sugar, cool
Whip, cinnamon syrup and cream cheese syrup. Never going back. Service was as awful as the soaking wet waffle was."}
{"text":"I've recently been on a waffle kick and was excited to see this spot open near me. Note that they specialize in waffles but also serve crepes- which is exactly what the previous business in this space sold. I am interested to see what they change to succeed where their predecessors did not.

Came in for an afternoon bite after a workout- location is very bare, one quiet employee working. She recommended the Strawberry Banana waffle, so that is what I went with. Waffle was served hot and fresh, with ample fruit and whipped topping. However, the waffle itself was  overcooked, hard and crunchy rather than chewy. Flavor was decent, looking forward to trying a savory option.

I would like to see them step up their offerings- the current menu is a little basic. Also, when I spend $10 for a single waffle, I kind of expect a real plate instead of a paper one. Upgrading their canned whipped cream to a fresh made version would also be appreciated."}
{"text":"This was my first visit using an offer purchased on Groupon. The service was extremely slow! We waited over 40 minutes before 1 plate for our table arrived. Once the food arrived it was cold- fries cold and the cheddar sauce in my philly cheese steak was already starting to solidify. I was not impressed at all with the philly cheese steak. For $16 not worth it.  I appreciated the waiter recognized the long wait time and \"comped\" the meal, but for my first visit not impressed and likely won't return."}
{"text":"Just left after sitting there for 15 minutes completely ignored.  Place was half full so it doesn't make sense.  After reading the reviews it seems like slow service is the norm."}
{"text":"Best waffles I've ever had.  They carmelize them like I've never seen. Try the chicken and waffles or waffle grilled cheese. 

*Update*
Went today (7/29) and had the worst service ever from Alyssa. She forgot our Mimosa twice. We got it after the food. Food took 20+ minutes. She forgot my waffle add-on."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Our server was really nice and waffles were delicious if you like the sweeter things in life as they are candied. My God sister loved the bacon it was flavorful with out being too salty.

If you are looking for a nice indulgent breakfast this is the place for you."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! definitely right up there with some of the best waffles and crepes ive ever had. no joke. 
we got the berry waffle with chocolate drizzle and it was out of this WORLD. the waffle had crystallized sugar inside it which gave it a really nice little crunch. it was then topped with strawberries, raspberries, blueberries (THICK layer of fresh, unfrozen berries - very worthy of its price) then whipped creme and warm chocolate sauce. our second dish was the tamato basil mozzarella crepe which was also absolutely incredible. 
not too expensive and very cool atmosphere in the heart of tavoli village. the waitstaff was very nice and eager to please - they will definitely be seeing us again!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Liege waffles, so I can appreciate what Waffle Bar is trying to achieve. It's a nice little cafe with friendly service. Unfortunately, the food was a swing and miss. 

My husband and I each ordered the chicken and waffles, which is chicken strips and a waffle. The chicken strips are on par with frozen Tyson strips, as in mechanically separated chicken formed into the shape of the tenderloin of a chicken, and covered in a ton of cajun seasoning. It was served with fries also covered in too much of the same seasoning. My waffle was cooked well; warm, soft, a little crunch from the caramelized sugar. My husbands was pretty dry and a bit overdone. 

My daughter had the waffle with berries which was beautiful to look at, but her waffle was rock hard with a slightly stale taste to it. When I say \"hard\" I mean in the way a super hard crouton bounces off your plate when you try to stick your fork in it. Very disappointing. 

I did, however, purchase the Groupon for this meal so I'm not terribly upset. Sometimes businesses give Groupon customers sub par service/product, so it's possible we just didn't get the best of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"I just bought a Groupon 5 days ago, it doesn't expire for 2 more months.....  They told me they  don't take Groupons anymore, but they'll take it this once.....  They made it out that they were doing me some charity.  Apparently they moved a couple stores down the street which makes them exempt of honoring the Groupon.....   That's not my business, nor is it my fault, poor business ethic....They food was cold, I ordered the Breakfast Crepe, the texture was too rubbery, and  the crepe was too thick.....   The bacon was greasy.....We had to ask for refills on coffee.  I won't be back again."}
{"text":"This waffle breakfast place is fantastic! I had the breakfast sandwich which reminded me of a Mcgriddle but a million times better. My wife had the build your own waffle and that waffle plate was off the charts delicious! I highly recommend the cookie butter with strawberries. On a side note, the waffle fries are beyond tasty. My daughter ate the fires and she tends to be quite picky. Not sure what seasoning they used but I suggest you don't change a thing. I will be coming back and wish this establishment the best of luck at Tivoli. This is definitely a draw here."}
{"text":"OMG! When my husband suggested we eat at the \"Waffle Bar\" I was like \"sure... whatever\", but OMG! I LOVED IT! I ordered a their brie sandwich and I had to lick the plate to savor the last of it (ok... that's not really what happened because as soon as I told my hubby that I was actually going to lick the plat he gave a small piece of his waffle to finish up the sauce... LOL).
In any event... this is a great place and the waitress was super friendly and professional"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE their waffles. They have this unique flavor that is super delicious. I also recommend their omelette. It's really fluffy. However, make sure you don't go when there is a big party before you. It took them forever to give us our food. But it was well worth the wait! And the owner was very apologetic and covered our meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and perfect service! The staff is very friendly. Jocelyn was my waitress and she was great! I'll most definitely return and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place wasn't packed, but selfishly glad it wasn't. Great food. Great pricing. Great service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We came here to try out trivia night that they do on Wednesdays. We didn't know that a lot of the topics were going to be things we knew nothing about like tennis players and unknown movies and their directors. I wish it would've been better topics where we could've had more fun. 

Anyway, on to the actual restaurant. The place wasn't that busy when we first got there, yet nobody came up to us to greet us or ask if we wanted a drink. We had to ask a couple times before a waitress came and then had to remind them 3 or 4 times before we even got any water. We ordered some drinks from the bar and it took a very long time and a few different waitresses before we actually got them. It did get busier and of course the wait times got longer. I wouldn't rate their customer service very high, seeing how many people we had to talk to and how many times we had to ask, to get anything. They did, by the end of the night start coming more often to refill waterswhen we were about to pay.

The best part of the night, would be the food, but I still can't rate it the greatest. My friend got the grilled cheese waffle and the capresse and tho he said they were good, he was left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry. My boyfriend ordered the Philly steak waffle sandwich and had no complaints. He enjoyed it. I tried some of the seasoned fries he got with it and they were pretty tasty. I got the chicken and waffle. I thought it was good. I just wish that you got more for how much it costs. I'd say the taste alone, would be 4 stars, but overall experience, is only 3."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Decided on eating here on a whim, and super glad I did!  

We went on a very SLOW Sunday afternoon (4:30 pm or so), Tivoli Village was basically deserted (were we in a zombie movie, or....?) But that made finding the Waffle Bar easier!  We opted to eat inside (because Vegas summer), and though our table was a bit wobbly, things were ok (that wobbly table could have been an issue considering they put 2 full bottles of sparkling water on every table :/ seems like an accident waiting to happen..anyhow..)

I didn't realize the Waffle Bar had as extensive a menu as it does, sweet, savory, but all decadent. 

we opted to start with the Nutella waffle, that was super rich.  Came with whipped cream..oddly enough it came out AFTER our more involved entree selections, even though we asked for it as a starter..but that was alright. I got the Grilled Cheese (which comes with brie cheese, mushrooms and bacon).  Now I thought it was going to be served sandwich style, but it was open face with brie everywhere (in a good way).  It was sorta more of a..waffle omelette without the eggif that makes sense.  My partner got the Waffle Sandwich (choice of turkey or ham, typical sandwich style with pesto), lord help me that pesto stuff was DELICIOUS!!  If I go again, I'd order the Grilled Cheese and add pesto and tomato.   

The service was great, though, again, it was SLOW (2 other parties at various points in their meals).  I'm still sorta confused how the easy item came out last...and after reading some of the reviews, it seems things can be slow/disorganized(?) but I was satisfied overall!  (There were 2 of us, and we bought the $30 for $15 yelp deal, so we knowingly over ordered. If you are just trying to live your life without a bunch of left overs, stick to one item per person!)"}
{"text":"Awesome waffle place. Stopped here on a Sunday morning with 8 people. Server was fast and friendly. Drinks stayed full and coffee was topped off multiple times. I ended up ordering the waffle sandwich which was amazing, the waffles are very sweet which I think made the sandwich. I would highly recommend this place if you find yourself in Tivoli Village looking for a new breakfast spot to try."}
{"text":"I went on a Groupon on a Saturday around 11am. Service is extremely slow. Crepe was not as pictured and had no sauce and very little cheese or ham. A total ripoff for $8.00! When I asked about sauce, the cashier said \"Don't pay attention to the pictures, they are just for show.\" Seriously? Waffle was dense and somewhat flavorless plain, hard to eat, and very dry. Being Belgian, I so wanted to like this place. I won't go back."}
{"text":"So there is a bar.. with chairs even, but you can't sit there and if doesn't look inviting because they put a wall up so you can see how they prepare your waffle.. you the thing we just cook in toasters lol.

Then my 9 yr old had to go to the bathroom... nope they ain't got one. You have to go outside and use the bathroom.

Basically it's a place trying to do everything to make a buck, in a space the size of a Foot Locker. 

Because there is no other REAL breakfast option in Tivoli this place will do well unfortunately, but I for one won't be coming back to wait 45 min for a glorified waffle.


Waffles are good though"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Highly recommended everything in the menu is good! The New Yorker Chef is soooo nice and friendly... We dine in at least 3x a month when we crave for waffles.. The food is amazing the presentation, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the friendliness of the people. Recommend to try the burger and never missed their waffle with powdered sugar! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place on Groupon.  We ordered two waffles - the Banana Nana and the berry one.  I added Nutella for $1.50 per waffle.  

The staff wasn't great.  They seemed like heroin addicts, honestly.  They moved very slowly, spoke at an inaudible level, and just seemed very sad and lifeless.  There was never any sort of welcoming or joy or energy coming from any of them.

On the other hand, our waffles were AMAZING!!!!!!  I have a giant sweet tooth and I knew I was going to enjoy the desserty waffles, but I was blown away by how good they were.  It was like a beautiful symphony of flavors in my mouth.  

Waffles are made to order.  We were the only ones there, so it took 5-10 minutes.  We enjoyed watching the whole process and smelling the amazing smell that came from the waffle iron.  It was sweet and yeasty - totally in a good way.

They have 5 sweet waffles - Original, Nutella, Banana, Berry, and Strawberry Banana.  There were some savory flavors as well, but I can only remember one of them - the pizza waffle.  If I go back, it'll be to try a pizza waffle.  Oh who am I kidding, I'd end up with a desserty waffle too.

Similar options are available on crepes rather than waffles.

Most options were around $9.  If I lived closer and had lots of disposable income, I'd eat all my meals here.  It was damn good!"}
{"text":"Really wanted this to be a win, but was sorely disappointed. Each of the 3 savory meals ordered were over salted. We had chicken (which are chicken fingers) and waffles, an omelet and a turkey sandwich. All you could taste was salt. 2 of the meals came with fries. If you like raw fries this place is for you. Sent them back twice only to have them served raw again.  The only decent item was the waffle and fruit. With so many great dining options in Vegas, there is no reason to go to this place. Discounts are abundant, but not worth the disappoint the meal brings."}
{"text":"I placed an order here through Eat24 and my food never arrived. I finally called the restaurant and was treated very poorly/rudely by their staff who berated me for having ordered through a service that they failed to correctly remove themselves from.

This place is expensive as hell for what it is and treated me like crap for a mistake THEY made. At this point, their food could be chocolate flavored heroin and I still wouldn't give them another chance."}
{"text":"My first visit to the Waffle Bar. Best Chicken & Waffles I've had thus far. Menu price $12.

The chicken tenders were cooked-to-order & served hot! Crispy on the outside & tender on the inside. The Liege-style waffle was filling with a hint of sweetness.

Our server, JOI, was amazing. Attentive to our needs, friendly & professional. This place is definitely on my go-to list!"}
{"text":"The place is empty with only 3 tables taken. No Iced Tea made at 11 am. Took 30 minutes to get my Pepperoni Pizza Waffle. Half burnt on one side. Somewhat tasty. The chef come over with the meal and does his best to be funny. At least he laughed at his jokes.
Plus the awkward dog bowls outside the door for the in house dog is quite appealing.
The waitress brings over the check and tells me. \"This is for your payment\" I asked her if she deals with many idiots that don't know what a check is? Her reply is  yes. 
I started with Three stars and ended this review with 2 stars."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we didn't have a very good experience here. We sat down outside, and waited for 5-10 minutes. Then I went inside to see if maybe you're supposed to order inside. The hostess saw me and said, \"oh, there's a 10 minute wait.\" There was hardly anyone inside, and multiple empty seats outside. I took menus outside, and we waited another 5-10 minutes for the waitress. The food took probably about 15-20 minutes to come out. I ordered the grilled cheese. It came out with a thick greasy gravy- not at all what I expected. The taste was even worse- a super sweet waffle that was underdone, topped with thick greasy gravy. It was horrible. My mother had the bruschetta- she couldn't eat hers either. A super sweet waffle with tomato and balsamic vinegar. Flavors that just don't go well together. We told the waitress we didn't like the food- (we didn't even make a dent,) she apologized. She brought the check with 10% off. I asked if there was any way they could take my meal off the bill. She went back, and was able to take the grilled cheese off.  So, we ended up paying quite a bit for food we didn't eat, and then still had to go eat at a different restaurant."}
{"text":"We sat outside and were a little forgotten. We didn't get the waffles which I would expect is the meal to get here. We did get the tenders and was not impressed. We will give it another shot and try the waffles next time."}
{"text":"This place has great food no doubt about it; however, the service is TERRIBLE!!!! First of all they are always understaffed with 1-2 people working the floor at a time while the rest are just standing there. The food took 1 hour to come out after we ordered and the restaurant was pretty empty. The check took 25 mins to come out and this place is overall very slow. The food is great quality and I suggest the iced coffee with hazelnut! This place could easily be 5/5 stars if the staff was somewhat efficient."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Small place. Service is a little slow, but not many tables and 1 waitress.   I'll come back and try something else.   Yummy fries."}
{"text":"The waffle bar was actually pretty good. I can't say that the price was well worth it, but I ordered the chicken and waffle dish and we also ordered the fruit crepe to share. 

As far as the crepe, it was a little sweet. I liked it though it was good however, the crepe shell was a little bit on the thicker side. I didn't ask but if they would have had an option to put Nutella instead of regular chocolate I would have done so. 
The whipped topping was good and homemade.

As far as the chicken and waffle, what impressed me the most was the waffle. It was very sweet and that I didn't even need to put the syrup on it but the syrup was good too. I wasn't sure I liked that the butter was in those containers you get when you get food to-go. Or that the syrup came in those to-go containers too. 

If I go back it will be for the waffle and to try to crepe with Nutella"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night after walking by it dozens of times on our way to some of the great restaurants in Tivoli Village. It was real good! I had the waffle and bananas and my wife had the Nutella crepe. Real nice and very tasty. Fresh ingredients and real whip cream...tasty!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon of $20 to spend here at the Waffle Bar. It was tucked in the back of Tivoli Square but very easy to find. I ordered the liege waffle club sandwich and upgrades my crinkle cut fries to be smothered in cheese, bacon and mushroom for only $2 more. Which was a pretty good deal! Yes the club sandwich is a bit hard to eat since it's pretty big but I managed and it was worth it! The creamy pesto sauce was delicious! The boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak and it was alright. I think one should stick with waffles here.
Cute place, great service, took awhile for food, but I'm not complaining! I felt like the portion was pretty big. It's very filling and maybe a little too heavy for brunch for me. I just wanted to sleep right after. 
They do have Happy Hour for drinks and small bites."}
{"text":"Super delish and quick lunch spot ! I got the breakfast crepe but switched out the meat for veggies and it was so good!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We loved it and we will definitely be back. Service was awesome! Food was so good. We customized our crepes and they were so yummy. Nutella, strawberries, whipped cream, powdered sugar and chocolate drizzle! Bam!"}
{"text":"The waffles here are seriously delicious! Crispy on he outside and soft inside with just the right amount of sweet. The coffee was very good, they serve Illy.
Our waitress was very friendly as well. And very helpful.

I highly recommend trying this place out! They serve sweet and savory waffles as well as pizza waffles."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love to come tin the evening have a beer and and some crepes. so much more than waffles. The service is always great and everybody is very nice. my favorite is the chicken and waffles or the breakfast crepes. you have got to check it out."}
{"text":"My grandma wanted to check this place out. It was in a cute village that I had never seen before. I'm not sure who runs this place but they need to improve on their hiring. I felt really bad for the waitress as it was only her and a cook. It was kind of empty when we walked in around 11ish. But soon there were about 8 different parties or so and the poor waitress was running around doing everything... Host, order taking, clearing tables, wiping them down 

Even the cook had to bring out food because she was busy. 

I think my mom and grandma were ok with their chicken and waffles. The waffle batter tasted like a donut. I ordered the brie grilled cheese which looked way better than it tasted. The brie tasted overly sweet. They put this cheesy sauce on top which is really overbearing and you can't taste the bacon and mushrooms. 

The waitress seemed kind of annoyed that everyone in there used a Groupon or Yelp deal, as you should considering the low quality food in such a fancy area. I assured her we wouldn't be back.

FYI: bathroom is outside."}
{"text":"Best for a waffle over load if you're five. As an adult, it is easy to nit pick all the seemingly solvable problems. Darn, and no chicken.

The service on a Saturday was slow. And not that it was crowded. It was that mix of irritating where you see other people getting served before you after having come in after you. We were sure they knew we were there, just no word on the waffleage until it finally got there. And it was only a single plate of waffles and fries.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for that little slidey top that pours the syrup. Love those things (Just not covered in goopy, sticky syrup).But it couldn't make up for the slow services. And, Hey, if you're paying over 10 bucks for waffles, you want some extras. I'd go again with a crew of young kids, but wouldn't try this as an adult thing to do."}
{"text":"GREAT Place, great food, prices, environment, and service!  Highly recommend Waffle Bar for everyone!  Our server was Sascha W. , she was very attentive and had great customer service!  It was a little slow when we arrived and picked up there after 11am, once the word gets out on this place they are going to be crowded everyday!  Go check it out, the menu prices are great!  Go look at IHOP portions vs prices and you will see the value in Waffle Bar.  The environment was very laid back and conducive to having a nice comfortable breakfast with the wife to talk and enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"The food is superb, one suggestion though will be to order appetizers right away as the waffles take a little bit of time to come out."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. I enjoyed the outside seating more than the food. Our waitress Sasha had great customer service. She was friendly and patient. I had the Waffle Bruschetta, waffle fries with cheese and bacon, chicken strips, and a mojito. The mojito was delicious and sweet and it came in a large wine glass. I would come here again."}
{"text":"My first time eating here. I love the outdoor dining.I have the smoke salmon crepe it was delicious.  . Was friendly and inviting which makes a big impact on the experience."}
{"text":"The waffles and crepes here are the best I've ever had!  The service was out of this world.  If your visiting it's a must try."}
{"text":"Yummy, and run by the nicest people. First visit here, and everyone so went out of their ways to make sure that we had a great experience here. This will be our new hangout spot on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last Friday, came in when only one person was working so it took a while to actually get my meal. In my opinion, they have the best crepes in town! The lady was super nice and polite. I love the concept of this place, i tried the crepe with fruit and whipped cream. The crepe had a very authentic taste, unlike other places it was actually very tasteful."}
{"text":"Love Belgium waffles!! I always stick with the traditional waffle with a light dust of powder sugar and their homemade whip. The waffles here are filling and delicious!! Great place for the family and even an outside area to dine just in case you bring your furry friends!! Plus tivoli is a great place to see."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst, if not the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. Waffles were tough chewy and lukewarm. Brought it to the waitress attention they brought out another one they said they made fresh but it tasted like it was the same one they just threw on the grill and reheated. Worst part were the employees. Our waitress never checked on us and another one finally brought us a refill of coffee after our plates were cleared. Tables were left dirty until other customers came in and they needed to be seated. A family came in and asked to be seated in a certain area and a male employee who we thought was possibly the manager had a meltdown and became very angry and aggressive. When the family decided they wanted to sit somewhere else the male employees started making comments about them. It was so uncomfortable I lost my appetite, and couldn't even finish my food. Do not waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"The first bite I said OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING ! I had the waffle grilled cheese and my boyfriends had the waffle burger . We came on a Friday afternoon and we're going again right now ( Sunday morning )"}
{"text":"I couldn't resist stopping at this unique restaurant.  Loved the outdoor seating. Waffle Bruchetta! Very good. Can't wait to return. Menu is Waffelly delicious.
Oh, yes. Waffle Fries. Spicy, perfectly fried, although they taste baked. No greasy taste. Wonderfully wafflelicious."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were alright, service could have been better. Location is great though, and happy hour is pretty cheap if the server adds it onto the check right :)"}
{"text":"It's cute. It has no bathroom. It has one harried and unpleasant waitress with a fake, smirky, grin.  It has a cute quotation on the wall attributed to a rock star, and another one that does not quite match it. It has chicken and waffles which has mixed reviews.  It has a decent egg and sausage waffle sandwich. It was not bad.  It has a TV that was playing sports talk shows.  It was not super fun.  It was not super at all.  I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Delicious waffles and a creative menu.  My only issue was they should offer \"real maple syrup\" for their crispy waffles. 
Restaurant was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Had waffles here this morning for early-morning breakfast. Service was kind and friendly. The space is comfortable and welcoming.  My wife loved her berries delight waffles with fresh raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries. Waffle Bar piled on the berries, which she enjoyed. The waffles themselves have a nice texture, a little crisp around the edges like a good french toast almost.  Would recommend and hope they gain a little traction and get more business as they deserve to be as busy as the other spaces at Tivoli. To be fair, we were there very early just as they opened since we had an early errand to run.  Would recommend for good, solid food and exceptionally kind service in a nice environment.  :)"}
{"text":"Waited an 1.5 hours for food. Never got the food. Finally just left... talked to manager and server.. kept saying my order just needed another minute to cook. Worst service I ever had. There were only three other tables in the restaurant occupied. I will never even attempt this place again."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon to try it out.... awesome. Awesome service too!! Ordered the chicken and waffles breakfast, big portions that hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"Place is cute. Nice location. It's a little pricey! My sister country fried steak was salt, so I don't suggest that. But the waffles are a must have. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"My bestie and I were visiting from Los Angeles and originally we were going to go to the pressed juice place but then decided to walk into this place. We absolutely loved it. It's clean, the staff is super friendly, polite and welcoming. We got samples of mimosas so we ordered the right ones and our waffle was amazing. The portions are big imo. We had such a good time we came back the next day for Sunday brunch. We plan to come back whenever we are in town. There's a guy that works there, his name is Jake and he was very nice about suggesting other places to check out as well. If you haven't been try it, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Mother's Day. The waffle with gravy and sausage was good. The chicken and waffles looked very mediocre and was told that it was mediocre. The service was very, very slow. Server was nice he was aware the service was slow (apologized multiple times) but that doesn't excuse how inefficient the kitchen runs their workflow. Are they short on waffle makers? One would think based the fact that most tables didn't have their food. Chalk it up to bad management. Interestingly, the same place but different restaurant name and brand had awful service on a Mother's Day a few yrs back. Could it be they changed the name, brand and it's the same management? Perhaps. Would go back? No. My advice: Go elsewhere. Too many better options in this city to waste time on poor service."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying there are a lot of reviews that are dramatic and overblown. I had the chicken and waffles. It's not Roscoes but it was delicious. I work in customer service and people are always dramatic when they want to get a point across, right or wrong. The waffle was good. Think we than a normal waffle, but not too thick. I felt it was just right, and it wasn't overly sweet. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The tenders were pretty tasty, as they season them well, and they aren't fried in crap oil. There won't be any grease on your plate from the fryer, can't say that about many places. They were nice and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Frozen or not, they're good. People are quick to Judge a frozen tender, but turn around and go to McDonald's after, sit down. This place isn't perfect, but what is. The service was aight, nothing special, but nothing to complain about. I'll be returning regardless of what people say."}
{"text":"This was probably one of our favorite spots we were able to check out on our visit to Las Vegas. We were at the farmers market when we stumbled upon this gem.

The menu was very simple and unique. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options. From waffle breakfast sandwiches , to traditional chicken and waffles and even waffle pizzas. It's a really fun place to check out! They have a ton of plates that you can only find at a place like this!

David was our server and did an outstanding job! He really knew what he was talking about wanted to make sure we chose something we were happy with. Upon his suggestion we went with the breakfast sandwich plate and mixed berry waffle with whipped cream.

We were blown away! The waffles were so good!
They are naturally semi sweet so you don't need syrup or honey for them all though both are available. What ever option you go with you will be happy! These aren't like your normal waffles, they are light and fluffy but dense and naturally sweet! You will really just need to try them for your self! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love this quaint cafe!  My wife and I were in Tivoli Village on a perfect Saturday morning and luckily found the bright cozy patio of the waffle bar.  Upon entering we found the staff to be very pleasant and attentive.  My wife ordered the Banana Nana.  The waffle was perfectly cooked and presented with fresh cut bananas and whipped cream. The perfect combination of texture and sweetness.  I decided to opt for something sweet and savory.  The breakfast sandwich was served on a delicious waffle that was accompanied by perfectly cooked eggs, cheddar cheese, and thick cut bacon. No better way to enjoy a breakfast sandwich than on an amazing liege waffle.  We will definitely be back to try another selection from a menu that offers an array of interesting, well-priced breakfast and lunch offerings."}
{"text":"Breakfast Spot . Nice outdoor seating. Pet Friendly. Many breakfast options. Great Groupon deal . Coffee was good . The seasoning on the potatoes was a little strong lots of herbs. Good though. Bacon was good and crispy . I would go back again . Cool brunch vibe"}
{"text":"We split the breakfast chicken and waffles and got waffle fries i/o breakfast potatoes. The chicken and waffles were fine and waffle fries were really good but I think they gave my date a \"funny tummy.\"  
Not the restaurant's fault, but worth mentioning that the place doesn't have a restroom so you have to exit the restaurant just to wash your hands before eat (public rr is close).
Also, kind of surprised that, at 12 Noon on a Saturday, with a couple of available tables, we had to wait to be seated. The hostess was doing double-duty as hostess and our server. It seemed like they might've let some staff go home too early. 
It was a good Groupon pick though probably won't go back and pay full price."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time earlier today for a late breakfast. The restaurant was clean and modern and looked inviting. When we were waiting to be seated, we were told there will be a 15min wait to order food as the kitchen was trying to catch up to the busy pace. Which was understandable, so we decided to stay and be seated to at least look over the menu and grab our drinks in the mean time. We sat at the table for s good 10-15min before our server came to get our drink order. The coffee was good, so that made me happy at least. Then, we waited another 10-15min to order, and another 10-15 for our food. Needless to say we waited a good 45 min altogether before getting our food. I ordered the two eggs breakfast and my wife ordered the waffles with Nutella and berries. My food came and at first glance the bacon was really greasy. But I still ate everything since I was starving and it was good, don't get me wrong. However, I noticed my meal was missing an item so I told the server and she brought out waffle fries, which I thought on the menu it said hash browns but I was wrong. It was a bit odd to have breakfast with waffle fries but whatever. The fries were good. My wife enjoyed her waffles, I didn't try it. Too sweet looking for me. 

In all, the food was great. Coffee was good. The staff needs to be better trained on menu items and service needs some improvement. I would try it again in the future after they iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"First ones in the other day with my girlfriend, waiter had no issues with serving 4 different tables at once, food was amazing and price was right! Will recommend."}
{"text":"Went to the rampart location wed jan 16th. Ordered the burger which was supposed to come with the waffle fries which is why I went there. They said out of their waffle fries which is supposed to be their speciality.  They offered breakfast potatoes but no discount. Said ok .... a few min later the waitress says they don't have the brioche bun. Offered bread. When I looked at her at disbelief,  she says I just serve the food not my fault. I said you should know whats going on. After reading reviews on Groupon,  this isnt the first time they said out of the waffle fries. Many other waffle places out there. Dont bother to come here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars for the service, but the crepe would have to be a 2 or 3..... I ordered the Nutella crepe without whipped cream. In comparison to other crepes I've had before I felt like their crepes were made too thick and heavy on the egg side. I guess that's why it's called the waffle bar.... The service was fast and very friendly. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool there's an up stairs as well with other shops."}
{"text":"I rarely complain. This place needs better management and better trained employees. If someone takes your order, begins the crepe and finishes cooking it...they should complete the order instead of leaving the crepe to get cold while you go to the register to take other orders. That's NOT how you work an order. 5-10 minutes later the employee goes back to finish the crepe...and then loads it up with whip creme when I specifically said no whipped creme. Now I have to wait another 10 minutes for a new one? No thanks. Asked for my money back and left. Never again. Poorly run and for how much they charge they need to have experienced employees...at the very least."}
{"text":"The waffles are amazing. The wife and I had the two egg breakfast.  The potatoes were delicious. The portions were great. There's a lovely patio area.  Service is great. Parking is good too. Awesome place for breakfast. Didn't have time to take a picture of the food because I ate it too quickly."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We went there just for waffles and it was so much more. The food was amazing and Chris, the chef, did an awesome job. He even made a special waffle for my son. Definitely will recommend this place to others and will be going back."}
{"text":"After 45 minutes and two cups of coffee -- my wife and I gave up on waiting for our TWO WAFFLE order and just left (we offered to pay for the coffee). The restaurant wasn't even full. Since Yelp is making me write more before posting, I will note that this place is located in Tivoli Village, which has numerous other good choices - I especially recommend Echo & Rig, which is more of a dinner place but has excellent breakfast options that will cost you about as much as Waffle Bar. I'm giving this Waffle Bar Groupon to someone I don't like."}
{"text":"We got the berry delight waffle and I was amazing! The server was extremely nice and the waffle came out in no time. The waffle was so light and fluffy and the berries were fresh. I strongly recommend this place and their delicious waffles!"}
{"text":"The new dinner entrees are awesome, great wine selection and some nice draft beers I especially liked the Stoney Red Irish Ale. The Salmon entree was nothing short of AMAZING. A tip of my hat to the Chef."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because we dined in on a Thursday night, but it was completely dead. We walked in and they joyfully welcomed our business. Football was on, rams and 49ers are going at it. Again we're the only couple in the restaurant, but needless to say, the hospitality was amazing. Of course I'm over here yelling and cheering for my team, it did not bother them whatsoever. Not sure of the waitress' name or the cook, but they served us well and treated us with exceptional service. 

Again, maybe it was just because of a slow night, however I've been to other businesses and even on a slow night, waiters/waitresses suck ass, including cooks.

Take care of the customers on busy days, I'm sure this place will turn out well eventually. Aside from that, our experience was amazing. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this place very often! The waffles are unlike any other waffle I have ever tasted. They are very dense and almost cake like. It's kind of a weird to think of a waffle being dense but they are delicious! So yummy and filling. We have come here for both breakfast and dessert but have yet too try lunch or any savory waffles yet. Everything on their menu looks absolutely delicious though! One night they also had a singer who was amazing and great with the crowd. This place will continue to be one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"We showed up, received horrible service from the hostess.  We then sat down at the bar, but had to grab our own menus.  We sat there for awhile and no one talked to us, so we left.  Maybe the food is good , but we never got that far...."}
{"text":"I love the feeling of this place it's cute and cozy! The waffles are amazing and the service is great. You should for sure try to grill cheese waffle or the different kind of pizza options!"}
{"text":"Had the hamburger waffle thing - quell surprize the hamburger alone was the best part. The waffle not so much. The worst part was
The service. Place was empty so you would think server would be on their toes. Hmmmmm perhaps the fact that she spent time he hour I was there facing the back of the restaurant not the floor. You must
You must invest in training the staff or
Your ability to succeed will be lost."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to enjoying breakfast with my son here. The restaurant is in a great shopping venue, great location in Tivioli Village and the decor of the establishment is welcoming. I wish I would have positive things to say about the rest of the experience. Had the Chicken Fried Steak and my son had the Chicken Strips and Waffles, I was disappointed to see the chicken strips as well as my chicken fried steak were obviously a pre-portioned frozen items that had been deep fried dressed up a little anserved. Food quality was average and I may have caught them on bad day because the service was really bad, so bad that I wrestled with leaving a tip,although I did, felt like I was rewarding the waitress for not providing a level of service that made me feel valued as a customer. Guess it is back to the Omelette House for quality food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I miss the old crepe restaurant. And this is a poor substitute. The space is open and clean, and I appreciate that. Leone is quite crowded this Saturday, whereas Waffle Bar has only two other patrons. 
The crepe is NOT fresh. Which is a disappointment because they have crepe cooking surfaces (I sat and watched the staff unwrap our crepes from paper). We ordered the berry crepe-it was filled with fresh whole blueberries, chopped strawberries, and an odd berry syrup which was overly sweet. Our other crepe, the Nute, was cold and had unevenly distributed Nutella. Overall, a sad brunch."}
{"text":"Bought a coupon and came here for breakfast just to find them closed with no explanation or reopening date."}
{"text":"Waited a really long time just for the drinks which were just 2 waters and a latte-30 minutes. There was even a large group who walked out and said they have been waiting for 45 minutes. If it weren't for David coming in as our server, we wouldve walked out. David took care of us and apologized for the wait and explained the shortage of staff. Food was good, but they need more staff to help them out."}
{"text":"Not sure but I think they have called it quits. Door says open at 8 am, arrived at 8:30, door locked, hand written sign saying CLOSED in the window. The service was spotty at best, but their omelettes were delicious. Sorry to see them go. Anybody heard anything about them closing for good?"}
{"text":"The place is clean and cute. And Tivoli village was very busy this weekend. Which, might explain the slow service.

But the whole experience was just awful. After leaving and looking at yelp!, I said \"We should have read the reviews.\"

I cannot recommend this establishment and will not go back. The concession stand at my kids elementary school is run better."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, it's a small place tucked in Tivoli village; heads up: there's no bathroom in the restaurant. A small place with bar seating, we sat at tables, I got a margherita pizza; the waffle crust was sweet, extra sauce on it and some delicious mozzarella cheese. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this. Then I had waffle fries on the side with plenty of seasoning. My friend got gravy sausage waffles, which she loves and home fries on the side. There was only one server who did really well when quite a few people came in. I would recommend this place for a nice easy lunch, many unique options."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for here. It was about 20 miles from home but so worth it. 

The place is pretty small but they have a patio area which would be great on a warmer day. It was crowded when we got there but were seated right away. Kind of reminded me of a yuppie style cafe. The tables are very close together. 

Several items to choose from on the menu I believe the only items not available in the morning are the dinner entree items. Still had several options to choose from.  

Naturally most of the items incorporated a waffle. There are some items that didn't and they also had crepes.  After debating on a waffle or crepes, we finally went with the waffles as the was the whole point of going there to begin with. 

I got the waffle breakfast sandwich with ham. It came with seasons waffle fries. My son ordered the Nutella waffle and added peanut butter to it. 

We got our order much quicker than I would have expected. Both were excellent. The breakfast sandwich was good size and overflowing with ham, egg, and cheese. The waffle has a sweet flavor to it which was a very good combination. The seasoned waffle fries were amazing. The Nutella/peanut butter crepe was equally amazing. The combination of the Nutella and peanut butter plus the whip cream made it very rich. Thank goodness my son and I had decided beforehand to share our entrees because it was too rich to eat a whole one by itself. 

With a cup of coffee added, our entire breakfast was 23 which was well worth it. 

Even though it was a bit of the drive we both agreed we would definitely go back and try some other items.

In the pictures the waffle sandwich was twice the size. I had already given half to my son before I thought of taking a picture."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch the other day. We ordered the nutella waffle, smoked salmon waffle, a ceasar salad and coffees. 

The waffles were OUTSTANDING! The nutella waffle was rich and delicious. The smoked salmon waffle was yummy. It came with a huge portion of salmon and had great flavor.  

The ceasar salad was disappointing. I would not recommend it. Service was average. Nothing great there.

I will be returning for waffles ONLY next time."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 different times, the service is good, really tight spot. The servers seem to have tunnel vision & only tend to help out their own tables, getting attention from a different server is pretty hard. Luckily i have had good servers that are on it. Food is pretty good, i ordered the berries delight waffle, great taste. Only complaint is wishing the waffle was softer, it is very crunchy & hard, def do not order a waffle if you are used to or like fluffy waffles. The side of fries are very tasty & delicious!"}
{"text":"Savory & Sweet

My favorite unfiltered dame and I stopped by for a quick brunch Saturday afternoon. The waffle bar was empty but ironically there was a brief wait to be seated. 

Sweet and savory nutella, fresh fruit, and whipped cream on top of a crisp golden brown Belgian waffle is definitely not a typical breakfast; however I'm all about dessert first! This sugary modern spin on breakfast was right up my alley in reference to the sweet factor. 

The overall service was just okay the waitress attempted to clear plates while we were still snacking which in my opinion is odd (again the restaurant was empty). 

Uncertain if I'd return without inquiring with Groupon first but I'd recommend this place if you have a constant sweet tooth like myself. 

$44+ (additional tip) for two ***"}
{"text":"David and Chris has beyond thrown our expectations out of the water.
Never imagined the customer services and the ambiance to be so incredible. My boyfriend and I were the only two in the place but we didn't feel alone. Outstanding food and incredible new experience well deserves the stars it has currently."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this place and it wasn't even worth the price of the groupon. The service is painfully slow as they only make one waffle or crepe at a time. There was also only one staff member present at any given time so all the tables were dirty as it was impossible for her to take orders, cook, and clean at the same time. They served 3 people in our party of 5 and then served the other two 15 minutes later. All of our food was served cold. Our order was wrong. The waffles were undercooked and bland. This place is more like a place for a snack and not for breakfast or lunch. For the price, the portions could be more filling. They leave the door propped open in the middle of winter and it was freezing inside with no heat. We left disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. I was expecting more because it's located in Tivoli Village. Unfortunately this restaurant is charging premium prices for frozen food poured out of a bag. We ordered the country fried steak and eggs which was a steak flavored protein Patty and the chicken that came with the waffles was chicken tenders that you would serve a child as a snack when they got home from school. I honestly doubt this restaurant will survive."}
{"text":"Sooo we arrived at the waffle bar at 1pm. We were told it would be a few minutes for seating, were sat about 10 minutes later. We placed our order with a waiter that seemed to be preoccupied with other tasks as he was trying to assist us. It is now over an hour later (2:02) to be exact, and we have yet to receive our food order. We were given the excuse that they aren't use to this kinda of business, they were slammed and are short staffed. The wait for our food continues .....

We left without getting served"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends.  Located in Tivoli village, this restaurant is nice and cozy.  For the three of us we ordered the berry crepe, chicken and waffles, and smoked salmon on a waffle.  

The berry crepe was more like a dessert than a breakfast item.  It came with whipped cream and powdered sugar on top.  The crepe was soft and sweet and the berries added some mild sweetness to this dish.  

I thought the chicken and waffles were ok.  The waffle was nice and crispy, but it came with chicken strips instead of a wing or thigh.  I though the strip was on the dry side and needed a lot of syrup and ketchup.  

The salmon and waffle was really good.  The only complaint was that it came with too much cream cheese.  The ratio was off.  I wish there was more salmon.  I removed half of the cream cheese and it was still too much.  The waffle is cooked with a layer of syrup or sugar on the bottom so its crispy.  Its like biting into a sweet crust and was delicious.  The orange zest on the cream cheese also added a wonderful flavor.  I would order this again.

The prices here are really reasonable, especially in Tivoli village.  I would definitely revisit again."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a few times and kept saying I should try it. I found it on Groupon. My husband and I got the chicken and waffles and the pizza waffles. I wouldn't order the chicken waffle again. Chicken is reheated not fresh. The pizza waffle was way better by comparison but still tastes like a cheap frozen meal Pizza. I spent $12 on the Groupon and $10 extra dollars. We had one drink to share. For $22 it wasn't bad but if I had spent more I would of been even more disappointed"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time. My husband had eggs and sausage and his was good except for the eggs which were very overcooked. I ordered a waffle, which I was really looking forward to. I had a Liege waffle last year in Portland and have been wanting another since. I was so disappointed. It was doughy and tasteless. I only took a few bites and couldn't eat any more. I was hoping since waffle was in the name the waffles would be good. It was probably the worst waffle I've ever had. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Waffle bar is the best place to go for waffles! Marianne was taking great care of us and went above and beyond than expected. If you go you need to try the chicken and waffles and the supreme waffle with Nutella. Make sure to sit on the patio when you go!"}
{"text":"Sat down at around 630 at 7 got drinks 730 finally started getting food service is horrid and having the worst service ever"}
{"text":"The food is worth going back to but NOT the service. The service was slow, slow, sllooowwwww!!! Our beverages took forever to come. When the food came, our server hadn't checked back on us once. When it came time for us to leave, our server still hasn't been by. We're waiting FOREVER!!! Ridiculous! There were only 3 tables being waited on. Place was not busy at all. Our server was just walking around doing nothing...who knows! I finally had to flag her for the check."}
{"text":"Amazing! First time visiting and will definitely be coming back. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The food took about 15 minutes or so to make but if you value fresh, quality food than you'll wait. The waffle was cooked with a beautiful outer crisp which complimented the succulent chicken tenders very well. The 2 workers gave great service. Sasha was an amazing server and David cooked the delicious meal! Looking forward to coming back and checking out Waffle Bar again."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Our server David was fantastic... And the food exceeded our expectations. I had the Turkey club, and my fiancé had the 2 egg & bacon breakfast with a waffle topped with strawberries and bananas. Both entrees were amazing; well worth the price. Plus the location and ambiance least was very romantic & relaxing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"With two locations in Las Vegas, one in the Venetian/Palazzo complex and another at recently-rejuvenated Tivoli Village, Waffle Bar promises to deliver Liege Waffles and Crepes to an City where such things are slowly gaining traction, a sizable off-Strip crowd on Saturday admittedly a surprise as the Restaurant was found 3/4-full just past ten in the morning.

Visited entirely as the result of a Holiday Groupon Gift Certificate, the competing dining options either previously visited or otherwise of little interest, it was immediately upon entering the tightly packed space just a few yards from Brio that guests were greeted by a middle-aged man conveniently gathering menus for the hostess stand, a two-top near the window soon filled as iHeartRadio tunes chimed overhead and College Basketball played on Television.

Most certainly another eatery prior, par for the course at Tivoli where little save for Echo & Rig, Brio or  Leoné Café has managed to sustain any test of time, it was shortly after seating that Water was poured and an order was placed, the volume level moderate save for a particularly loud pair of friends plus a couple and their fussy infant.

A pleasant enough place, walls including quotes from the likes of Lady Gaga surrounding an L-Shaped floorplan that extends to an outdoor patio during warmer months, it was no more than fifteen minutes before two entrees emerged from the kitchen, the question as to whether Maple Syrup was real never answered save for \"I'm not sure, I'll go find out\" though a taste suggested no.

Thankful that the real stuff out of Vermont had been brought from home, a taste of the Waffle before topping medium-crispy and slightly sweet but lacking the smooth caramelization of those found in Belgium or nearby at Andres or the Waffle Love truck, it was after a slathering of Butter and pour of Syrup that the Chicken and Waffles was compared to so many others, the Waffle itself standing up to the test but Tenders no better than store-bought with dried out Meat and flavorless Breading.

A bit confused by the \"seasoned Potatoes,\" for all intents and purposes flaccid French Fries cut into thirds and pan-fried with Herbs, it was by way of a bit of Ketchup that the Spuds achieved mostly edible status, a shift from savory finding the \"Cinna-bomb\" Waffle expectedly sweet thanks to Cinnamon Butter, Cream Cheese Frosting plus a spray of Reddi-Wip-esque topping.

**1/2:  Probably best judged as an alternative to the ever-popular Leoné Café, the price-point similar and both offering Coffee, Waffles and Crepes at Tivoli Village, Waffle Bar offers good service and pleasant environs for those at the Shopping Center while unfortunately lacking the ingredient quality or kitchen skills to make anything about the food memorable."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've busted the waffle bar at Tivoli and it won't be the last. The food was great as was the service!  Maury was a great host with plenty of great suggestions for us second timers."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in tivoli village! The staff is so accommodating and amazing! The food is so good! I would recommend the waffle burger and the club sandwich + their waffle fries is so good! Will definetely come back!"}
{"text":"I just went to this place and will never go back. It had a total of two people dining and I walked it and none of the five people working there acknowledge my kids and me. They didn't turn around until my daughter screamed when her finger were stuck in the front door. I asked to do a to-go order using my groupon. The hostess told me that they wouldn't accept it, but would offer me a slight discount. Why would I want to pay for food that I already had a groupon for? The groupon hasn't even expired yet. They clearly need the business. It was the middle of the day and practically empty. I'll go find better food and better service and I'll happily pay full price somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday at noon after visiting the farmers market. The place was half full at noon. This should have been an omen but I was hungry  and chose to ignore it.  The lady at the order counter was nice, took my order for a ham and cheese crepe and I took a seat. First off, their cook is extremely SLOW, it took over 20 minutes to get a simple crepe. And the place was half full!  Also, it's loud with a playground in the back. When the crepe finally came, I received plastic utensils with an apology that they were all out of silverware. 

Now, about the crepe: it was bland, with gummy dough and the inside was dry. Besides the fact that eggs are not a requirement in a ham and cheese crepe, they were dry and crumbly. I presume they were microwaved. In an effort to improve the presentation, a sprinkling of cold shredded cheese was thrown on top (see my picture). 

Final analysis: the food is so so, service is super slow, prices are high and ambiance is poor. I pity the parents who came in after me to feed the kids because they saw a playground in the back. They probably had to wait forever. 

My prediction: a new place will be in this space in 6 months."}
{"text":"Waffle Bar reminds you of a cute French cafe which you have the option to sit inside or outside. 

The first time I came here I ordered The Original Waffle and Veggie Omelette, they were both mediocre and nothing too special. The potatoes I have to say are well seasoned. 

As for the second time I ordered the Oatmeal. Let me tell you the upset look on my face while I waited for my order to be delivered. It was just a bowl of oatmeal, nothing else. No fruits, nuts or even brown sugar. I had to order an extra side of fruit to add some flavor the the blandness of the oatmeal. DO NOT ORDER OATMEAL PLEASE!

As for customer service it was mediocre as well. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"The restaurant opens at 8am as advertised on the door. We walk in for breakfast at 8.10am and the hostess tells us they need 15 more minutes then ushers is out and locks the door. It was unprofessional and rude. She could have offered us coffee while we waited but she was extremely rude. 

I don't believe it has anything to do with race but we did not feel welcomed and they should not advertise a start time when it's not accurate because people drive from their homes based on it. 

Please train your hostess on excellent service. We are now at Leone Cafe and it's packed, service is five star and we have been seated. This is how to preserve a business and increase revenue. You may want to hire people who care of your business."}
{"text":"All I have to say is YUM! This was some of the best brunch food in Tivoli Village! We had the waffle pizza, chicken and waffles and Sangria. The waitstaff was friendly and the atmosphere very chill. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Had the chicken and waffles, it was great. Husband had waffle and berries, great.  Nice place, waitress friendly. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Super friendly and amazing crust and flavors on the fried chicken...making this place one of the best spots in Vegas for chicken and waffles! I've tried a ton and it's rare for a place to get both elements done perfectly. The mashed potatoes with bacon on the side was a nice bonus. It was an unexpected find for us in Tivoli during a late night craving after 9. So nice to know it exists for atmosphere and waffle cravings in that cozy part of town."}
{"text":"The service has never been great. It's always very slow. A lot of the time, they just don't get the job done at all. For example, replenishing water seems to be an insurmountable task in their eyes.

The food takes a long time to come out after being ordered. It's very inconsistent. For instance, sometimes the chicken and waffles breakfast seems homemade and is very flavorful but other times it seems like they opened a box of grade school cafeteria chicken strips and threw them in the microwave.

I momentarily bumped them up to two stars because I saw they let someone open carry without being dicks about it. By the end of the meal, they were back down to one star.

I desperately wish that my wife would stop buying Groupons to this place so I could permanently put it in the rearview mirror."}
{"text":"We found this on a Groupon! What a delightful restaurant! Friendly service , a large menu featuring crepe's and waffles. Joi our waitress was very helpful with offering suggestions. The food was fresh they even have a cappuccino machine with Illy coffee. We will definitely visit again. The prices were middle of the road but worth it. Thanks again Joi !! Your new friends from Arizona"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for a late breakfast today. I ordered a waffle and my daughter ordered a crepe. First of all for some reason, I have seen several businesses occupy this space in Tivoli Village and none have been successful. I am not so sure this one will be either. Placing our order was no problem, but we waited way too long for the food. Another family came in after us and received their food first. We were sitting outside at a nice table and I finally had to get up to see why it takes so long to make a waffle and crepe and there were only three tables of people waiting. When I asked what the problem was I was told it takes time to make the crepe....really a Nutella crepe?? Then when I said the other family was served before us, I was told
that it was a mistake. No kidding!! Once our food arrived, I found the waffle cold, overdone and dry. The best part was the strawberries and bananas on top. My daughters crepe was much better and very tasty. I may go back and try them one more time as every new business deserves a second chance. This particular location may just be a cursed location for any business that comes in but time will tell."}
{"text":"First off. FAMILY OWNED i can't even put into words how friendly and accommodating the staff here are.  my man New york cooks up some of the best chicken and waffles i never thought i would have  i'm visiting from LA right now and lost my wallet the day before my bus and was a little short on the bill but sascha worked it out for me and i will be back here tomorrow with a big fat tip for my homies over at the Waffle Bar 

PS i wish i got better photos but the food looked too good and i was too hungry"}
{"text":"It was a good experience....the service was very good okay plus, thus 4 stars.  One had chicken tenders with waffle, the other a chicken fried steak and eggs, and we shared a Nutella crepe.  The entrees were both good and the crepe was very good...tender with not too much Nutella filling...the right amount.  Although not exceptional food,  certainly tasty enough to return and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great unknown spot in Tivoli Village. Across from Restoration Hardware. give it a try it's not busy... For now. hopefully this place finds its groove sticks around!"}
{"text":"Unremarkable.. if I could give a zero I would.

Iced Tea must have used same filter as coffee because tastes like old coffee.

Not busy but waited for service..a long time. 

Food came out waffles legitimately were hard as rock.. no syrup for the waffles..

Forgot my daughters order and we have all finished.. still not brought to the table..

I will not be back."}
{"text":"Not family friendly establishment server was not there for the service. We have to ask for water and etc. She seem in hurry to close the store instead of focus on guest service!!! Lastly before we checked out giving us hard time with the yelp deal offer they have on yelp then she said this and that and etc... I simply respond we won't ever be back at this establishment ( I dont have time to argue, Im here to enjoy dinner with family). Food was OK but service and smart comment coming from our waitress lady make things worst as it is already is!!! Oh yeah by the way you cant request where you sit down the waitress/host choice where you sat down as a family. Smh"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I got the salmon plate. Came on top of a waffle and cream cheese. Very interesting combination. Service was good. Nice little patio outside to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I went there with my friends last Saturday January 27 at around 12 noon. Our party consisted of 4 adults and 5 kids. Upon arrival we noticed the place was empty with the exception of one older couple.  When we told the hostess it was a table for 9, with 5 kids, she gaves a not so pleasant look and said to wait.  We immediately got the \"vibe\" she didn't want our children in her establishment.  Mind you, our girls' ages range from to 2 to 5 but they are very well behaved. Sure enough, she came back a few minutes later and told us the wait would be about 30-35 minutes because they had all the tables reserved for a very large party that should be arriving at any minute.... Would you had believed her?  We didn't.  The hostess rudeness and DISCRIMINATORY behavior made us turn our back and head over to the cafe, which we have visited every weekend when we go to Tivoli. The cafe of course, was packed. The food was amazing as usual, and the nice manager came to our table to say hi.  Want to take a guess why this place was EMPTY and the cafe had people lined out the door? Look no further than this review."}
{"text":"Made another visit and had the steak and mushroom crepe and vegetarian crepe..AMAZING!!!  Service was great and my waitress was very attentive and great personality.   We will be back again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and left blown away. Not only was the food amazing, but the service from our waiter David and cook chris was phenomenal. This is going to be our new weekend spot. Very cozy, yet elegant, jazz music fills the area and the food leaves your taste buds wanting more. Couldn't be more satisfied with our visit."}
{"text":"Still holding steady at three stars even after trying the waffles. Were they good? Yes! Were they $11 good for a single one? Nope! 
I get the waffle appeal though. It's a thicker, denser waffle with a sweet outer layer crust. Paired with your favorite fruit and whip cream it's definitely a delightful little breakfast. I also can appreciate the waffle bar theme (waffle menu, wine and champagne bar) BUT.... I could just as easily go to waffles cafe and get the same love on my plate (sans alcohol) and come out feeling equivalent food joy without the near guilt I felt paying $32 for TWO single waffles & two drinks. No eggs, bacon, potatoes.... nada. A minor side note, each time I was in there it's only had the one same waitress alone. This morning she was completely overwhelmed and although she did her best and was as friendly as she could muster through the chaos, we still waited 5-6 minutes to be seated (restaurant wasn't packed) and then another 15-20 for our check. One family waited longer than that and another patron got up to let her know that when she had a moment his table was ready to order. 
I felt bad for her but it didn't go over well for most folks and her vibe was very frazzled. Sometimes running to And from where she needed to be. 
I can't say for sure I'll be back. Even if I'm in TiVoli.... I would rather hit cafe leonè, or even give Canters a go. Decent food nonetheless, but not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Small portions 
Super slow service
Average food 
We waited forever for our food, will never visit again"}
{"text":"This Cafe is a prime example of food places that throw random ideas together (that in most cases wouldn't work) and expect them to work. The service was fine but the taste of some of the dishes were disguisting. The serving sizes were also very small and not satisfying. The prices are a bit higher than I feel as they should be. We walked in and they was no one present to welcome us. I probably won't be returning until some positive improvements are made."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza waffle, oh so delicious!. Good size too!, really filling. They also have crepe"}
{"text":"I'm so confused with why this place has such low reviews. It was amazing! We had a party of 8 sit at the patio (including 2 toddlers) and every dish including the salads were amazing! And they offer a 15$ coupon for 30$ worth of food on Yelp! 

The waffles were made perfect, a little sweet which was so good on the pizza waffles, and the fruit waffles were just as great. I can't wait to go back and get more! For those of you have left bad reviews you should really go back and give them another try-We all seriously loved this place!!!"}
