{"text":"Amazing food! Owners is really friendly. Recommend the lassi. Different curries will have different levels of spices so just a heads up."}
{"text":"Mediocre rating - the high price point bumps it down in overall rating. You can get way better value elsewhere.   The amount of protein included in the Roti (whatever you get) is minimal. The mild slice isn't all that mild. Decent flavour overall though.   We even tried an appetizer: samosa, which was a little too greasy for our liking (have your napkins ready - it dripped on us)."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and this location has a huge turnover however the food is never good there. Well my roti place is not an exception. I ordered roti and i found it tasteless. Definitely my roti place is not my place to eat. On the bright side the customer service was ok."}
{"text":"My Roti Place is the newest restaurant in one of Toronto's most cursed locations. Can it survive the curse??? I think so.   For starters, they stand out with their crazy painted exterior. Which I think will draw people in... And also... Because the food is damn good.   I'm not a roti expert myself. But I do really like Roti. And I've had roti and many spots in the city. I didn't expect much from this place because it's in a cursed location - but to my surprise it was pretty damn amazing. I INHALED a butter chicken roti like it was air. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars was the amount of meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't too generous either. I asked if there was a lot of meat in the roti and they said it came with '1 portion'. Which could mean anything lol. I think they should start serving it with 1.25 portions. If they did, and if other stuff on the menu tastes as good as the butter chicken roti  - I would change my review to 5 stars. Because the food is damn tasty. And the service was really great. I can tell these people care.   I hope this place lifts the curse! I believe it will."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to swing by and get a roti. They are open late, quick to serve, and their spice levels are nice. We had a lamb vindaloo and a butter chicken. The vindaloo was their 'stupid' spice level and very good. The butter chicken was flavourful and creamy. Prices are completely reasonable for this area."}
{"text":"Just going to echo the previous reviews, as they are spot on.  The staff is really friendly and the fillings are really tasty, but the rotis lack much filling, and the filling itself is mostly sauce without enough meat (or any vegetables or anything else, as far as I could tell, the addition of which would be awesome).  I keep sort of wanting to go back because it WAS tasty, but can't justify it for the price (plus I'm always pretty sure I'd still be hungry afterwards)."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times already.  The roti is good (very thin) and the sauces are flavourful.  They are generous in terms of meat don't hide the morsels in a ton of veggies. The only thing holding me back from coming here more often is the price. It's a $15 lunch kinda place."}
{"text":"Honestly, not sure what they are thinking!! I had a lamb roti and was throughly disappointed! First of all the tomato base was canned, not fresh. Secondly they used a spice in that base that you never use for anything that's intended to be spicy and thirdly I had to search for the lamb pieces!!   Nope, never going back there..."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Korma Roti (build your own roti). It comes with a small salad and dessert in a little salad dressing/sauce containers. Flavour was quite good, but the spice level is definitely tempered - the medium only had a hint of heat. If you like spice go for more."}
{"text":"Generous portions of authentic and delicious South Indian cuisine! Try their butter chicken w rice! The Butter chicken is studded with moist and tender pieces of chicken breast! 5 stars!   The chicken biryani was chintzy on the chicken breast and needs to be more moist and tangy.   Overall, this is a place worthy of huge praise for their butter chicken and impeccable customer service. I will be back with friends to enjoy their other fabulous choices. They deserve 5 stars just for their butter chicken and customer service.   Thank you and I wish your business well! I know your competitors are shaking in their boots because they cannot deliver the same level of superb flavours you conjure up everyday!"}
{"text":"I was craving a roti today.  I went for a long walk and came across My Roti Place on Queen Street W (at Cameron Street) so stopped in to check it out.  Apparently they have been open about ten days.  I love love love rotis.  Here you \"build your own\", choosing the roti, filler and sauce.  I got a chicken roti with Superior Butter Masala (the server recommended this sauce).  The chicken is white meat and it's was just meat.  If you want chicken and potatoes (which I thought was standard in a roti), you have to ask ... I went with just chicken.  I like butter chicken but have never it in a roti and it was a good combination.  I ordered mild sauce and there was a bit of a kick to it (I'm glad I didn't get medium).  There was a lot of sauce, though.  I guess I like a dryer roti with more chicken.  Rotis comes with a chick pea salad and dessert."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Indian roti in the city so I'm going to break it down in the hopes that the owners can turn this very promising place around. It just needs some minor tweaks that will make a huge difference.  What's good: the sauce flavor is on point. The price is very reasonable.  What needs to change:  - The sauce is way too liquidy to work in a roti. This is acceptable in a bowl, but not inside bread. It turns to soup completely as you cut into the roti. All they have to do is cook the sauce down more. Have some patience! Tweak the liquid content. This is essential. I know you have more than just roti but roti is your thing so get that right first.  - The paneer is not great. It tastes like a block of cheap pizza cheese including texture. Too gooey, not porous.  That's really it. Fix your sauce thickness and your cheese. The sauce flavor is there, it's just sooo watery.  Fix this and I'll be there all the time, you're open late plus weekends so you can totally kill Ghandi Roti! You're so close."}
{"text":"Delicious roti, especially for a late night snack! Tikka masala sauce was great service was fast"}
{"text":"ButterPaneer Poutine, it's  made up of potato fries and panner sauted with makhani gravy and garnished with cheese and fresh onions which tastes very good and creamy ,mild spicy"}
{"text":"There are lots of places with better roti.  Overall it was fine, but not worth going back for.  The roti itself was heavy on shell and low on filling.  The turmeric roti didn't seem to add anything for the $1 upcharge.  And a good number of the vegetables were undercooked (I had a veggie roti).  People were friendly enough, but the food quality didn't particularly impress me."}
{"text":"Nothing more than an average restaurant. I love saffron spice kitchen which is right across the Street."}
{"text":"Nice little Indian fast food joint just opened up on Queen St. We checked it out and went twice already  We ordered the turmeric roti with lamb once and fish the other time.... Both were very tasty!! The biryani was good, but the rice was a little mushier than the ones we've tried elsewhere. Also had a mango lassi, I think it was super refreshing, just a little too sweet for me, but prolly the right level of tastiness for others.   All in all, quite excited for this little gem in our hood! It's so new (I think they open this very week) that not all items on the menu are ready yet. They're still working out some kinks like make it available on Ritual and all.... Hope they do well and survive!!"}
