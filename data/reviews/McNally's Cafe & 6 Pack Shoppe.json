{"text":"Always a good choice.  The food is simple, but is done well.  The Dagwood and the haddock sandwiches are amazing.  I usually end up taking some dessert home as well, they usually have different options each time.  The staff is friendly and the food usually comes out pretty quickly.  Best of all, the prices are reasonable.  It's a great place to come in and just relax and eat good food."}
{"text":"I have been coming hear since they opened and never had any trouble The owner always comes out and make sure that every thing is ok the service is great the food is always right on the big plus is that I can get a beer with my meal and if I want to I can get a 6 pack to go"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a good meal with friendly people. You will enjoy the Jumbo Whole Wings, the entire Mac Sandwich section and the breakfast entrees that are served all day. This restaurant has what most big restaurants lack, the Personal touch that the employees and owners display to their guest's experience."}
{"text":"Killer hot chocolate  French toast.   Good job Tim   Hope to see it on the menu again."}
{"text":"Thank you!  A hidden gem in the middle of nowhere but so worth the trip. The staff could not be nicer and more attentive and genuinely friendly. Nice, smaller, clean place with food that's amazing. Love finding a place that makes great food that's made fresh, not the crap from a franchise. Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to McNally's! It's pretty simple, really....it's a small place, they serve American Traditional food, with a little Irish flare! The owners will come out and ask how you are doing and if your food is okay, very friendly. 

Prices are reasonable, the staff are friendly, and the food is tasty. Nice sized portions for the price. I recommend their breakfast (served all day!) or - if you're really hungry - one of their Mac Sandwiches. They also accept Clipper Cash, which is an added bonus. 

McNally's also has a decent beer selection and, due to it's location right off of Clay Pike, it's easy to run in and get a 6-pack. Cheaper than a lot of other local business, I should add.

The only reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is this...although the staff are friendly and I've never personally had a customer service issue, there is clearly tension between some of the staff. My husband and I have noticed this on two occasions now. Not so cool. On one visit recently for lunch, there was one waiter and one waitress working. Both were running around, because it was lunch time and fairly busy. However, the guy is a little more talkative and not moving around as fast as the girl. It was obviously an issue, and I took note. At one point, the waitress was at one of her tables next to us, and it clear that she knew them personally. She was complaining about the guy, and actually said to the couple that he was \"a waste of oxygen\". Ouch...."}
{"text":"Great place to go.  It's the only restaurant in the the town of Rillton. The food is good and the prices reasonable. The owners check on every table to make sure the diners are satisfied"}
