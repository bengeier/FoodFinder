{"text":"This is our go-to take-out place for Chinese. Great hot and sour soup for starters. Everything we've gotten here has been been tasty. The sauces are flavorful without being overpowering. The fried rice is great and one of our favorites. We've eaten at the restaurant several times and the staff has always been very friendly and helpful in suggesting something new."}
{"text":"If not for the \"awful customer service\"i would have given 3 stars because the food was good! The older lady who sat us down was cold and unfriendly Thursday Feb 2nd around 1130 am!
Our younger server was almost the same!
No friendly greeting just non friendly,dull,no emotion service! My spouse and I were left feeling disrespected and will never come here again! No excuse for this kind of customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is super awesome. I have not been disappointed a single time .... and delighted every time I go there. Both the food and service is fantastic

Though to make this place awesome, there is one criteria .... you have to be reasonably awesome yourself too... meaning you will be brave to ask the server for the chinese menu and though u may not understand everything ... still order from that menu anyway. I promise you won't be disappointed. Highly recommending \"Liu San Shen\"

OK, on the day you are not feeling very awesome, there are still a good american chinese menu. Try the Mu shu chicken/pork, they are the best I have and do ask for recommendation from the server. It is a family owned restaurant, and they are super friendly... they will help you to pick up a dish you like"}
{"text":"We had an early Saturday afternoon dinner.  Restaurant was moderately busy, but the food was wonderful.  We had the Sweet and Sour Chicken and the Mongolian Beef.  A bit too much food coloring in the Sweet and Sour Chicken, but the taste was great.  They also seemed to use a very good cut of flank steak for the Mongolian.  Very tender... a few too many onions, but that's not a major problem.  The mother / daughter team who waited on us were great and made every effort to make us feel comfortable.  For an ordinary looking strip mall style restaurant, we loved of the food and probably will be back.  The restaurant appeared to be clean although the rest rooms could be tidied up a bit."}
{"text":"Yummmo!!!!  This place is the only Korean style Chinese restaurant that I know of in Chandler since Sun Chinese restaurant closed.   This place is tastier and has a lot better service too. My family nick named it the Pecking Gourmet of AZ after the one in Garden Grove. 
Their Kim Chee is pretty good. They offered us the raw onions with the brown pates but we passed. They don't serve daikon on the side. 
We ordered the  , ,  , and the .  The sweet and sour beef ( ) was perfect. We really liked the light batter and the perfectly fried beef. The multi seafood dish (  ) was okay. Not as many varieties of seafood  I'd like to see jelly fish but we're not anywhere near the ocean. The sauce was good, just was disappointed to see the Asian fish cake instead of the real thing. As far as the fried shrimp dish, I like my shrimp not breaded but the sauce was on point and the breading was not too heavy. Last, the classic   which my family lovingly refer to as \"axel grease noodle\" was a classic. 
We will definitely frequent this joint.
P. S. They do have a separate American-Chinese menu if that's what you're craving."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice was cold and fishy. The egg rolls were old. And the Orange chicken was drenched in sauce and soggy. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the staff is attentive and friendly. Family ran and their bonds show as it's awesome.  I love bringing friends and family here.  If you're simple on food tastes general tsao chicken is awesome and their chicken and string beans!!!! If you're into soups their siZling soup is awesome! Best crab puffs in AZ!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and everything about it was mediocre.  The service was just ok.  They didn't seem very friendly and everything that we asked for seemed to put them out.  I got the Chicken with Broccoli and wanted it spicy.  My girlfriend got the Hunan Chicken.  Both meals came with egg drop soup as a starter which was very bland and nothing to write home about (nevermind on yelp!)  Then came our main courses.  Again, very bland (I asked for spicy but you would not have known it by this dish).  The chicken was such small thin pieces that I do wonder if it was something else.  The broccoli was fresh and the consistency of the sauce was nice but, it just needed some flavor.  My g/f's only ate about 1/4 of her meal.  I wish I would have read Renee's review about asking for the Chinese menu before I went here.  I will have to remember that if I ever end up back here again."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service is awesome.  We had only been there one previous time about a month and a half ago.  Today when we returned, our waitress Amy remembered that we had more than 5 in our group the time before (my folks had been visiting).  She then started taking our orders and remembered my daughter is a vegetarian and steered her away from a dish that contained some meat.  This place is right by Intel and she must have seen hundreds of tables since then. It was incredible.  

This place is right in our neighborhood and the food, service, and Amy's hospitality make you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"Always love coming in for a piping hot bowl of jjajangmyeon! The staff is always personable and friendly and the food is delicious and served very quickly. Love it here! :)"}
{"text":"Very mediocre Chinese food.  I wish it was better because I can walk there in five minutes.  It would be the perfect take-out spot."}
{"text":"Love this family and their food. Really good and authentic mandarin dishes. We share a spice noodle soup and a seafood combination which were delicious and pur kinds ordered orange and lemon chicken. Good food.
Very friendly people. We'll come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times.  The food is good, quality is consistent, and the portions are generous.   About half the time I order it for pick up and we always end up with enough leftover for another meal.

The owner is very friendly and even though my visits are months apart, she always recognizes me.

They also have the \"Chinese menu\" which I used a couple of times when I went with someone who knew something about Chinese food.  We had some kind of a seafood and noodle soup that was very tasty."}
{"text":"Chef Chiang's is a neighborhood restaurant that is clean, well lighted and the staff is friendly.  The restaurant is large with booth seating and a couple of large round tables for big parties.  We've dined in a few times and the service was excellent.

We typically do take out and the food is ready at the time that they said it would be, hot and well packaged.

Chef Chiang's is our go-to restaurant when we have craving for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! It's not like PF Changs..it's not suppose to be...Took the kids there and they loved it as well..good chinese food in the desert..."}
{"text":"Ate here the first time and tried the mongolian beef because other reviews recommended it.  It was awesome!  The next time, we ordered 2 different meals to go.  We paid for them then came home and opened the bag only to find out that they competely messed up out order.  They got our soups right and one of our sides, but our 2 entrees and the other side were wrong.  Decided to try those meals because I didn't want to drive back to Chef Chiangs, and both of them were pretty gross.  Love the mongolian beef there but I don't know if I'll ever risk ordering it again only to get the wrong meal."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout and was very disappointed.  I got the beef chop suey and chicken chowmein and both were absolutely bland.  I could barely tell the difference between the two dishes.  Maybe a bad night?"}
{"text":"Love this place for great Chinese food. I also cannot say enough about the service. I was a single diner that evening and I was given first class treatment. I waitress checked on me often, kept my hot tea filled, came over and started a casual conversation after I had finished the meal and asked how everything was and told me she hoped I would be  back soon. 
I ordered my old favorite \"orange Chicken, Egg drop soup, spring rolls and hot tea. I don't know which part was my favorite as it was all very good, very hot and very fresh. Portions were very generous also , in fact I could not finish it. 

I did notice that this place is very authentic in venue. Nice but not over the top, over decorated or fancy. Comfy really. I also noticed that this establishment is frequented by many members of the Asian Community and i can see why, it is just plain awesome."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in AZ for ja jang myun. The noodles are soooo good and the sauce is on point!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese food place! The sizzling rice soup is the best by far! Great service, they know their customers and know what we are going to order as soon as we get there! Great family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good JajangMyun! The shrimp Egg FooYoung was awesome too. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Best food ever ! have been coming here for 5 years and have always had the best food and best service. Love everything they have, why go anywhere else this place is the best. We lived right down the block, we moved to North Mesa over 4 years ago and still make the trip because it is soooo Good !"}
{"text":"Good food, nice workers, a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere and a pretty  good value for the amount of food. My sister, who spent some time in China, commented that the fried dumplings were pretty authentic. There just isn't much to make this place memorable. Nothing unique that really makes me want to come back. If you're looking for Chinese food but don't want to think to much about it, this place is right up your alley. If you're looking for a hip place with some local flare, keep moving, nothing to see here."}
{"text":"Chef Chiang has the BEST jjajangmyeon in all of AZ! I've been to every Korean Chinese restaurant and this is by far tje mosy legit spot! You will not be disapppointed!"}
{"text":"First time here and we're very impressed! Service was very cheerful. We had an awesome chicken fried rice, crystal chicken and orange chicken. I I also like that they have Tsingtao. The decor is nicer than most stop mall Chinese restaurants. The veggies were very fresh. I think that by being located across the street from Intel they probably go through a large volume which keeps items fresh. This is our new favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for a really late lunch around 2:50pm on a Tuesday. We asked our server if they were still serving lunch, knowing that there's only 5 mins left before their lunch specials are over. He came back after asking the kitchen and informed us that \"yes, last call for lunch specials!\" Quite honestly, I was expecting a \"no, order something else\" response so it was a pleasant surprise.

Food: I ate before I got here so I just went for a small bowl of classic egg drop soup. It was okay, nothing too special. But then again, I can't decide on how good the food of one restaurant is solely based on a bowl of egg drop soup. So I tried my friend's order of Gan Jajangmyun and it was really good. The black bean sauce was thick and flavorful, just the way I like my jajangmyun!

Service: My soup came out almost instantly along with some wonton chips and sweet and sour dipping sauce. I had no idea if the chips normally come with one of our orders or it is complimentary starter (?!) Either way, it was nice to have something for us to munch on while waiting for the other order to come out. 
I normally drink a lot of water and the server was good enough to keep refilling my water whenever my glass is half empty. Given that we were the only table at that time, it was a good service for an Asian restaurant after all. 

The one little thing bothered me was the people (who seemed to be the owners) sitting by the bar. The whole time we were there, they looked like they could care less about this business. I even caught them staring at us at least once...I mean if you really are that tired or whatsoever, then take a break or leave early or something. 
Being in the hospitality industry myself, I know how important it is to keep your image in check at all times while you're on the floor dealing with customers. So, just a little note for the people who work here.

Back to the list of great things above, I kinda dig the whole red with strings of tsingtao beer flags decor. It matches with the cuisine they are serving here. Will definitely come back next time to order my own gan jajangmyun and maybe try other dishes as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is close to work, the food is good, the service is quick and the staff is friendly.  I am a sucker for their green beans and pork, extra spicey.  Oh and their house fried rice is delish."}
{"text":"I loved the food and the people are very nice, I don't understand why people are reviewing this getting angry that the food wasn't caviar on a silver platter and such. It's a nice little restaurant near the neighborhood that you can go to when you're feeling lazy and not wanting to cook at home :)"}
{"text":"Pretty tired or reviews that say the food is good/great, but the service sucks - and then give a place 1-2 stars.  

If I'm going to a fancy Michelin star restaurant or somewhere I'll spend over $100 a person, then yeah...I might give a sh*t about service in my review. 

This is a $10-15 entree restaurant. Acting so snoody/high and mighty about service when you're basically one price step above a McDonald's.  You're a yelper, not a professional food critic. 

These are good hardworking people that run a small crew EVERY day -  they deliver on great food and should be rated accordingly. 

I go here regularly for the korean chinese menu.  The black bean noodles (jja jang myun) and sweet and sour beef (tang su yook) are the best in the valley.  I get it every time I go and haven't bothered to try anything else.  

Sure, not many choices around Phoenix for this kind of food - but it always satisfies my craving.   

If you know the dishes I'm talking about, go!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Aside from the usual Americanized-Chinese fare, this place shines in what it has to offer on it's \"Chinese\" menu.  The only place I know that has the ShanDong Chinese/Korean favorite, Ja jang myun.  If it adds to it's credibility at all, both my Chinese AND Korean friends talk highly of the ja jang myun here.  I've had it myself and I thought it was pretty good (although I hadn't really tried it any where else so it's really hard to gauge against anything else).  So if you're sick of the usual sichuan, cantonese, *insert chinese province here*, then give Chef Chiang's a shot."}
{"text":"Came here based on the good reviews, but it turned out to be a disappointing dinner. One star for friendly service. The food was horrible. It was your typical Chinese-fusion American fried wannabe Chinese food. Comparable to the kind you find at mall food courts.

The dinner special comes with a fried dumpling, a fried cream cheese stick, and a fried cream cheese Rangoon. The sesame chicken was basically a chicken cutlet (also fried) cut up into strips and drizzled with sesame chicken sauce. 

The wor wonton soup had a few dumplings with very little to no meat inside. Flavorless too. Sadly, not returning even if the service was good."}
{"text":"Still the best jja jiang myun i found in Phoenix area!  They have a korean menu with all the favorites.  Pretty solid!"}
{"text":"Just okay.  I don't even remember what I had and I ate there recently.  The service was friendly but slow."}
{"text":"!!! They have very good jja jang myun. I justed recently started coming here but i recognized the owner lady right away when i first set foot in this restaurant.  She used to run a smaller chinese joint that sold jja jang myun many years ago in mesa off of alma school and baseline. I remember driving 30 miles to satisfy my jja jang myun craving back then. First time in 10+years,  i had jja jang myun (korean style Chinese noodle wuth black bean sauce) in arizona made by same owner from that restaurant i used to go to all those years ago.  Jja jang myun was just as delicious as before."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night.  Egg drop soup was watery and bland and the general tso's was over breaded and very dry.  Even the egg rolls weren't good.  The only redeeming dish was the crab angel which had a nice amount of filling.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time to this restaurant. The food was great with generous portions. One of the items we ordered was their egg foo young it was Excellent! In fact everything we ordered was very good. Staff was very friendly & service was perfect! I picked the restaurant and everyone there said I made an excellent choice. We will all return again. Go check them out I think you will feel the same."}
{"text":"First time here...very comfortable clean place. YELP led me here...I was greeted and seated right away. I was on my way home from work and had an intense craving for Wor Wonton soup and mu-shu pork. So that is what I ordered. The rest of the menu seemed like what is to be expected from a neighborhood place like this. But I knew what I wanted so did not explore other options. The service was great, beyond my expectation. I really enjoyed my meal and that also was very good. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"moved to az from california and ive aways been looking for a place with a legit jja jang myun (black bean paste noodles) and this is the only spot that ive come across that has it. there are many types of asian restaurants but only a few that serve this chinese-korean style and do it well... this is one of them. the tang soo yook was also on point. nomnomnom!!"}
{"text":"When I moved to the valley, I was looking for a good Korean style Chinese restaurant that have noodle dishes that is only served in places like this. Where I came from, there were many of these restaurants to eat at so my expectations were high. I have tried other places and have been disappointed. My friend recommended this place and now I'm happy. The bad thing is I live 40 min away (no traffic) and can't go as often but it is worth the drive. It is a family owned restaurant and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant when it was still called \"China Bowl\" and am still a BIG FAN.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious!  Some of my favorite dishes are:

Jia Jiang Mian: these black bean paste noodles are a classic and wonderfully flavorful.  The noodles have a great consistency and this dish always comes out perfect!

Shrimp and Lobster Sauce: Intense flavors and fresh shrimp!

Crystal Chicken:  a very light dish with lots of veggies.  The sauce is also light but is divine over rice.  

Candied Sweet Potatoes: a little pricey but you get A LOT.  The japanese(?) sweet potatoes are cut into blocks and are covered in a sugary candy coating.  this stuff is heaven on earth and makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  Its not on the menu, but definitely ask for it, its worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was so bad, I had to go to the hospital afterwards and my mom also got sick. The chef said, \"Too bad\"..."}
{"text":"A hidden gem right by Intell. You should ask to see the Korean menu and the servers can provide helpful overviews of the dishes. Great tasting food, will be a regular."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch there! The service was fantastic, both the female & male servers were very nice and polite. The food was so good. We had the jajamyun and sweet & sour pork, which came with couple sides of the cabbage kimchi and onion with black sauce. All very tasty and delicious! Food came quick and hot as were served as the dishes were done cooking. Love it served that way because I love my food piping hot and fresh. Never had a bad meal here, but I usually come for lunch too. Less busy that way."}
{"text":"They have the best crab ragoons I have ever had.  service was awesome.  Food was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here but I'll definitely be back more often.  Definitely order off the Korean Chinese menu not the American Chinese one! We ordered jajangmyun and spicy chicken with vegetables (lajogi) and they were both absolutely delicious!!! It was way better than Suns Chinese Restaurant especially the chicken!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and very consistent on getting a nice diner at a good price. We eat here about twice a month for the last 4 years. 
My only suggestion is the rest room could be cleaner. Customers use this area too. Otherwise it be 5*"}
{"text":"My rating is based on the Mongolian Beef alone. I have been all over trying new places for Mongolian Beef, and this place has the best. 

I only had a few minutes to run in and out, but it was incredible and I am planning to go back very soon. 

Very friendly staff, quick service, great food. 

I highly reccommend if you are wanting to try a new place, go here and get the Mogolian Beef."}
{"text":"The one and only Chinese restaurant remaining in Phoenix area that can satisfy my craving for Korean style Chinese food.  Friendly staff (most of times) and consistent quality of food."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner from here last night.  I am a vegetarian and allergic to onions, so to say I am picky is an understatement.  The gal that answered the phone was both knowledgeable and accommodating to my specific diet.  I ordered the beef with broccoli (sub tofu) and it was amazing!  The egg rolls are also a must.  I am definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their Jjamppong.  Have been going to their restaurant (old one too) for literally 14 years.  Extremely nice and hospitable.  Can't get enough."}
{"text":"Very friendly people here. It's like going to a family friends restaurant. The amount of food in each meal is something to prepare for each time. Their egg soup is good and I have to order it next time. I will also get the orange chicken again. I love good food, it's hard to order small now a days."}
{"text":"As a Korean American, it's hard to find a Chinese restaurant that provides both American style Chinese food and Korean style Chinese food. This is exactly the reason why I love Chef Chiang. In addition to standard dishes such as Orange Chicken, this restaurant also serves jajangmyeon and jjampong, two Korean-Chinese fusion dishes. The lunch special is around $6.99 and is so much better than mainstream restaurants such as Panda Express because of the taste and quantity of food that you receive. The restaurant is family owned and operated, so I've always thought the services is super friendly. I have been going to this place for over three years now, and won't switch anytime soon!"}
{"text":"We come here often to have JJaJangMyun, JJammpong and Tangsuyuk. These are popular menu for Korean-Chinese restaurant. I really like their JJaJangmyun and Jaammpong. It does not taste like the ones from other restaurant but it has \"home-style\" characteristic to it. The restaurant is not busy at all most times. I also like SongSan but this one is more closer to my house. The price seems to be reasonable and I would recommend this place for those whom want to try JJaJangMyun or JJammpong."}
{"text":"Awkward awkward service from manager/owner. Super overpriced.  You are not missing out on anything here. I must say though the waitress was nice.

If you want good service and traditional dishes.. check out Chou's Kitchen or Szechwan Garden in Chandler."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a birthday dinner with family! The service, food and ambience was awesome. The birthday experience with complimentary treat and bubble machine is very cool and unique!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you like General Tso chicken.  It was just... kinda chewy, the sauce is too sticky and overpowering... not the best... there are better options out there."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this restaurant 0 stars. Food was very basic & overpriced. The majority of their food was very greasy and had looked like it was made hours before.  Considering I had been the only person in there the owner was just standing at the bar awkwardly staring at me eat. The waitress was okay, & when I first walked in, there were workers napping in some of the booths. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone especially with their horrible service & their extremely rude workers."}
{"text":"THE JAJANGMYON was soooooo gooood! And they give you a pretty large portion. Don't come here expecting a chatty, all-american server. They will help you if you need but will not stand there and have a conversation about your life. I am not complaining about this, thats just how asian servers are. Lovee the food!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new spot for some Chinese food... I have seen this spot for sometime now I entered to an empty restaurant.. Waitress was eating lunch at the bar and got up and seated me I was looking over the menu and she was playing with her cell phone and packed up her food and took care of other people that worked there that were eating... I use to work in food service and we would never think of eating on the floor it takes away from customer service... It made me not want to order but I did anyways... I ended up ordering the Moo Shu Pork and The Mongolian Beef... I rate the experience as followed.

Moo Shu Pork - C
Mongolian Beef - B
Staff - D-

I am not into when they wrap the Moo Shu Pork up in the crepe... I like to build my own and you get left over's that way...The Mongolian Beef was pretty good but I did not like my eating experience at this spot and will not be back."}
{"text":"Saw this place in the Phoenix Mag, Asian Food Guide edition.  Came to try out the two dishes that were recommended - San Dong Garlic Chicken and Jia jiang Mien.  Both were yummy and didn't disappoint.  I love Jia Jiang Mien (Black Bean sauce with noodles).  It's like a comfort food for me.  This one was good.  Not the best I've ever had but still yummy.  Bf tried it for the first time and gave it a thumbs up.  They've got Dan Jia Jiang Mien which is a drier version apparently and a Special Jia Jiang Mien which has sea cucumbers and something else that I forgot.  Will be back to try both.
It's served with a side of kimchee and like other reviewers, it was eh.  It wasn't even spicy.  What kind of kimchee is that?!
The San Dong chicken is a half a chicken that is fried and then chilled and cut into pieces.  It's served with a garlicky vinegar sauce and cucumbers underneath.  Bf was skeptical b/c he likes his food piping hot.  But he liked this one a lot so thumbs up. 
Service was not the greatest as the older lady didn't look all that enthusiastic but since i didn't come for the service, that didn't matter to me.  Will def. be back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place hoping to find a good Chinese spot, but left disappointed with very mediocre Chinese food.  We had General Tso Chicken (1/5) and Hunan Chicken (3/5). We also had spring rolls (2/5), wontons(0/5), and hot & sour soup (1/5). The only decent thing was the Hunan Chicken. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I paid our first and last visit to the Chef Chiang Restaurant.

We had the ZaJang Meyoun Meyoun (noodles) and the Sweet and Sour Shrimp.

After we left that evening, we both suffered from tiredness, cotton mouth, and headaches.

We think they put MSG in our food."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past year.  The first time, I really liked their house special chicken.. the second time (a few weeks ago), we tried their Mongolian beef.  Wow..  Just amazing.   We ordered their Wor soup last time we were here.  I wasn't completely thrilled, but I still ate it.  What's really good is their egg rolls.   They come in an order of two with sweet n sour and hot mustard.  Make sure to mix the two! amazing taste. 

Our recent trip we had Mongolian beef, house special chicken and orange chicken.  Just delicious food.  I love going to a Chinese restaurant and know what Im getting.  Sorry if that means its too American Chinese, but it's good food.  

Also the staff is wonderful there.   I love when the staff can walk over and start up a conversation about anything, making you feel like one of the family.  

I love this place and  highly recommend it.  If you don't like it.. eh.. oh well, might just be my own personal taste then.  If you do.. awesome!."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time before I left for college many years ago.. came back here when I was visiting a couple weeks ago and glad to see it's still delicious! I only ever order the Korean chinese stuff -- tang su yuk, jajangmyun, and jamppong. Mmmm always so good. Wish more places had the stuff! The lady working there (..probably the owner) also speaks pretty perfect chinese AND korean haha.. AND even the taiwanese dialect! #props"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have been going there for years! It's a neighborhood family owned, family run restaurant, that serves their family's recipes. The egg rolls are delicious, their wor wonton soup has an amazingly flavored broth, and in their shrimp dishes they always serve big plump shrimp and plenty of them! They will also make any dish spicy and their sauce they put in the Chicken with String Beans dish is to die for! I'm very picky about having good Chinese food, and this is the best I've found in Phoenix Metro. The Chiang's are a hard working family and their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Order 2 dishes: Spicy seafood noodle soup (?????Seafood Chou ma miam)and Sweet and sour beef from a Chinese's menu. It was sooo good!"}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience.   We ordered lettuce wraps and chicken  with vegetables.  The lettuce wraps are an appetizer.  The waiter brought the chicken with vegetables first, placed on the table and quickly left.  He didn't bring us any plates.  We waited a couple minutes and asked the other waitress if we could have 2 plates.  The waiter then brought our lettuce wraps.  We told him that the lettuce wraps are an appetizer and he just said \"sorry\"and left.  He never came to our table to see how we were doing.again.  Sorry that you got a zero tip!

 It wouldn't have been so bad if the food was good - it wasn't.  The lettuce wraps had no flavor at all and the chicken with vegetables hardly had any vegetables and the ones that were there were over cooked.

My last time at Chef Chiang!"}
{"text":"So it was my sons night to pick dinner and this is the place that was picked. He had been here prior with some family and said it was good. We are always hesitant to try new places but, we will definitely will be back here for sure! We ordered the Chinese style sweet and sour beef, beef chow main and Jajangmyeon (Korean Black Noodle). Everything was flavorful and delicious ."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews on yelp. That's why I was surprised at how typical and generic the food was here. It's not that the food was bad I just wouldn't describe it as standing out from any other typical Chinese takeout food. I actually didn't see the Chinese menu mentioned in the reviews until on my way out of the restaurant - perhaps you have to ask for it?  it was posted on the window so I might go back and try something from that menu. Otherwise the food was very typical American-Chinese takeout fare. Our dishes had one-dimensional sugary sauces on them. The fried rice was pretty bland as were the fried eggroll and other fried things that came with the meal. I might try it again to see if other food choices are any better but otherwise I don't see dining here again over any other place.  The waitress was very nice and the vibe of the restaurant was casual. As for  improvements besides the food,  they might consider serving tea with the meal and possibly changing the music."}
{"text":"The American Chinese food is actually not very good, but that's probably because it's American Chinese food.  The Korean noodle dishes are very, very good.  I have no idea what they are called, as I was taken here by a Korean friend, but I'm definitely going back and ordering more."}
{"text":"The food is very shandong style- at least from my standard as shandong ren 

Love the beef and ???

Haven't got a chance to try shandong chicken."}
{"text":"Roast beef and garlic chicken are the best. (While I found people usually talk about their jja jang noodles)


 The reason I gave 3 stars is because their staff aren't super rude when we got there. But the food deserves five stars."}
{"text":"I had an incredible experience at this restaurant. I went there with a friend to pick up Jia Jiang Mian (black bean paste noodles), which Chef Chiang is popular for. The noodles were excellent (particularly the pork), but the service was what really stood out to me. As we were waiting, the owner engaged us in conversation and gave us free candied sweet potatoes an appetizer. She even included free kimchi with our order, which was a great addition flavor-wise to the noodles. I will definitely be going back to eat at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I picked up take out from Chef Chiang yesterday.  $6.95 for the hunan chicken lunch special.  It comes with the entree, white or fried rice, egg drop or hot & sour soup, one crab rangoon, one fried wonton filled with some indistinguishable meat and one thin fried thing filled with cream cheese and possibly something else but I couldn't really taste anything besides cream cheese.

The crab rangoon had no discernable crab flavor.  If I had sent it off to a lab they may have found some I suppose.  The entree was soupy.  Very soupy.  The sauce was ok...nothing special.  It was a little spicy.  The veggie assortment in the chicken dish was pretty minimal and the only thing that tasted fresh was a little bok choy.

I don't care for egg drop or hot & sour soup so I won't comment on that.  I didn't eat the egg roll.  It looked overdone & greasy.

I probably won't go to Chef Chiangs again.  Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This the place to go in the east valley if you want korean/chinese food. Have never tried the regular menu honestly since the jjajangmyun, kkanpungi, etc are so good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now, but I have to slap myself because I have ordered things I'm generally not a fan of so I couldn't enjoy my meals as much as I wanted to.

This last time I came in, I ordered chicken and broccoli instead of beef and broccoli, which I'm sure I would've enjoyed much more. Stupid mistake, but the food has been amazing anyway. Someday I'll learn to order correctly and will LOVE my meal. For now, I give this place 4 stars.

Service is great as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this to me and it seems that this restaurant has some really deep roots in the Phoenix area as it seems like a handful of Phoenix natives know about this place. 

Located near Intel's office, Chef Chiang is a deceptively big restaurant located next to a huge indian restaurant. They must have a lot of business because Intel employees probably go there a lot. Nevertheless, my crew wanted to eat there because they craved a certain type of food I admittedly haven't tasted.

Chinese-Korean food is a strange combination of two different foods that combine the sour pucker of Korean food with the heavy savoriness of Chinese American food. What you get are these dishes that kind of have a familiarity to Chinese American food, but have been transformed into something that is arguably different. When you eat this food, I feel a wave of familiarity with a hint of differences. 

I am so used to Chinese American food that looks red or brown and this food emits either light colors or black sludge. 

Just a note: when the waitresses pass out the menus, you need to ask for the secret menu if you want their legitimate food. These come in bright and ugly blue and pink laminated menus that are about a page long. On this menu there is Chinese, English and Korean translations for each dish.

Our crew loves to eat so we ordered a lot. We had garlic roast beef and chicken, a clear sweet and sour pork, a 2 style noodle dish, and 3 bowls of noodles covered in this thick black bean sauce called ja jiang mien.

jajangmyeon seems to be the ultimate Korean-Chinese food as everyone wouldn't shut up about it. This was new to me. I've never heard of the dish!

Appetizer: Onions and black bean sauce - before the mean, a wedge of white onion was placed next to a small plate of black bean sauce and a small bottle of vinegar.
Garlic Roast Beef and Chicken  - It looks like this dish was prepared by roasting the meat and then soaking it in a sweet vinegar for a certain amount of time. The dish was pretty much soggy and sour. The crispiness of the skin as lost to the vinegar. As you can tell, this dish was not my favorite. I found the enjoyably of warm, crispy meat was diminished with this dry, sour, vinegary and soggy pile of meat.

Liang Mien (2 style noodles) - This very colorful dish was plated beautifully and then mixed by the server. The two noodles represented here are these flat, wonton-like noodles and these giant eff strands. The taste was slightly sour and quite unique. The mesh of textures made the dish stand out but the flavor was nothing to write home about.

Sweet and Sour Pork - The way they make sweet and sour pork is way different than what you see in other Chinese restaurant. In this restaurant on this menu, their sweet and sour pork is covered in this cloudy white sauce and littered with vegetables. However, the sauce does taste like regular sweet and sour sauce. It looks like for this particular dish, they remove soy sauce.

Jajangmyeon - The star of the show came in bowls. Inside these bowls were noodles piled with a black sauce. For the average consumer, they'd pretty much be wondering why this noodle dish was so great. However, this is indeed the staple street food in Korea and has influence in China. The dish consists of very basic ingredients that anyone could really make. It is pretty much stir fried egg noodles, onions and zuchinni covered with a bunch of black bean sauce. It reminds me a lot of the noodle dishes I used to cook for college. The thickness of the black bean sauce was a great coating for the noodles and makes the noodles have substance when you slurp them.

The dish is unique and I think I'd order it again. It is actually a very inspiring dish for me to cook at home. Overall, it's a cheap dish but it fills you up and apparently for my group, it's very nostalgic."}
{"text":"Very sad Sun chinese restaurant closed. We were looking for a Chinese Korean replacement and found this place.
 This place serves korean chinese dishes. They're restaurant had tables filled but they need to improve their customer service. The family  restaurant wasn't friendly and made us feel unwelcome in their restaurant. 

The food we ordered the chicken had the garlic & jalapeños but lacked flavor. The black bean noodles that we traveled here for were watery. I'm sad Sun doesn't  exist anymore because this place is a poor attempt.  They also didn't include kimchi or the yellow radish in our to-go order.
 I'm  happy to support local businesses but this place seems to have lost their passion for the restaurant and it shows in the food."}
{"text":"This was our second time here, and the food (so far) is consistent.  Great appetizers, and food.  However, coming from Houston TX, the portions are smaller than what is served in TX.  LOL"}
{"text":"Wow. The best crystal chicken I had....the veggies were tasty and so is the chicken. This is a good option for someone watching their diet. Also the hot sour soup was very good...again the best I had. There was a roll that cane with it...soft and delicious.

The lady said am I coning tomorrow..well I just might :-)"}
{"text":"Always really good food and service and the price is pretty good for the amount of food you get. Family owned and operated. Have never had a bad experience ordering take out."}
{"text":"I have been eating their food for almost a decade since I was a kid. Their Jia Jiang Mien is fantastic and I always order that dish every time I come here. The owner is the sweetest lady. I will miss this place a lot once I go off to college. I recommend the sweet and sour beef also!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tofu veggie soup and house chow mein it's really good and authentic! I'm picky about Chinese food and this is really good."}
{"text":"We've gotten takeout from Chef Chiang's a few times. It's not in our regular rotation because their prices are too high for takeout and for such mediocre food. Tonight, however, it went beyond that. The egg rolls tasted like they were full of rancid vegetables. The spare ribs had obviously been cooked hours earlier and left to sit. Everything else was coated with a shiny layer of grease and msg. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! The whole staff treats you like family and the food is second to none. it's amazing when the broccoli is obviously fresh, chicken is steaming, rice is sticky and hot!   The veggies are always cooked to perfection!! This ain't no Panda Express so be prepared to be amazed!!"}
