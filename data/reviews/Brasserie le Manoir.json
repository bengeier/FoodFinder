{"text":"Nice West-Island bar. Great patio with lots of TVs in the summer. Cheap beer. Food is decent but could be better. Good for sports events. Definitely better than bar hymus across the street."}
{"text":"Le Manoir est comme une vieille pantoufle; il fait chaud, ça pue et tu es bien. 

Pour regarder un match c'est correct."}
{"text":"No visit to Pointe Claire and Montreal is complete without a trip to Le Manoir. Outdoor patio is extremely pleasant and food good as always"}
{"text":"Not much to say except that the place has pretty much hit rock bottom since the acquisition by its latest owner."}
{"text":"Went this morning for Sunday brunch with a friend. We were very hungry as it was after a swim meet. For not much money we got very large breakfasts with good helpings of each thing. I had a 3 egg Greek omelet that was decent and it came with home fries, fruit, baked beans, toast, jam, and coffee, all for about $10. The service was ok, sometimes a long wait for coffee refills, but I easily could've flagged the waitress down if I'd wanted to. For what this place is for brunch, which is decent food in large portions for not much money, it gets a good rating."}
{"text":"A disappointment, and in sad shape. It's not the brasserie it used to be. Having not been in almost 15yrs, I had been looking forward to my visit, and although the waiter was charming and supper friendly, host(?) Head waiter was rude & disrespectful about people standing. Was there for a reunion dinner and the rudeness from this person was disrespectful. The space itself is in a sorry state, men's bathroom looked like a dirty men's locker room and as it was raining outside, the roof was leaking. The food itself was well portioned and acceptable, for bar food. Sad to say, although I have great memories, that's all I have....."}
{"text":"Manoir! What happened?  The Manoir used to be a favourite meeting place, the food was brasserie style but good, very good. I can't believe how far down the quality has fallen.  I ordered tilapia.  I found it smelled very fishy and then I tasted it.  I should have known better.  When fish smells fishy?  Something is wrong.  It was bad.  It was so bad that my appetite completely disappeared.  We called the waiter over and he actually tried to argue until I told him to taste it himself.  That ended the argument.  He came back with the \"generous\" offer of not charging us for the fish.  How kind.  My husband ordered pig's knuckles.  They were grey and rubbery.  

Not to be deterred by one disaster, after 2 decades of eating at Le Manoir, we tried again.  Roast beef this time.  Le Manoir was always noted for their roast beef.  It was horrible.  Barely cooked and no taste.  I like my meat rare but this thin piece was still moo'ing.  The veggie sides looked and tasted like they came from a tin.  The fries were greasy and found their way of repeating their performance for a good part of the evening.  

The service was abrupt and slow.  I was so disappointed that when a recent hockey dinner was to take place there?  I declined, even though it was included in the cost of my husband's tournament.  Not a chance.  I would rather stay home with a bowl of Alphabits than subject myself to the sub-par food and service again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I return time after time. Even when the place is crazy busy with a hockey game on the screens (Go Habs) the good comes quick. I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was crappy. The waitress would come and then leave again for at least a half hour. We had to wait over 45 minutes to get the bill. The food wasn't very good and I wasn't the only one that didn't enjoy it neither did over half of the people I went with. The food was especially bad for the expensive prices that came with it. Overall really didn't enjoy my experience and will not be going back again"}
{"text":"The Manoir has been there forever and for good reason. It looks old fashioned, it feels old fashioned but that's the charm!

Cheap beer, good food, PIGS KNUCKLES! They are yummy and fall apart.

Whenever I'm nearby I try to stop in for the nostalgia and something cold to drink.

It's been a while since I have been able to stop in so I hope things are still good!"}
{"text":"Nice spot to watch some sports and have a nice meal with friends. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised because it was not very busy so figured we would get fast service but that was not the case.
The service was slow and not the greatest. Had to ask for water and napkins a few times because it seems like she forgot about our table. Also she spilled my salad dressings and I was waiting for her to bring a replacement and she never did until I asked.
So let's get down to the food!!!!
Calamari were not bad at all and they had a nice spicy mayo sauce with them. Wings were out of this world good and I was very happy about that because I am picky about my wings. My son had the ribs and he really enjoyed it. We also had the classic burger and it was very big and it was good as well. My mom had the fish ans chip and she liked it a lot. I decided to try the filet mignon brochettes and they were cooked perfectly. The only downfall is when you take the salad instead of the soup for your table d'hôte option you end up with again another salad in your main meal. I love salad but that is a bit much.
The place was great and I like that they have TV's everywhere do you can see the game wherever you are sitting.
I would give it another try but I would hope for better service."}
{"text":"Price is decent, food is decent, service is rather cold but not unpleasant. 
I keep getting carded every time even though I look much older than my age. I once even got carded twice in 20 min, the second time while I was actually drinking beer. I mean, at that stage, it's already too late you know ;).

The place looks quite amazing in the inside though. Decent sets of TVs but it can get quite loud."}
{"text":"Don't expect too much and you'll be fine, not bad but obviously not great,  good place to group with friends, have some beer and watch sports"}
{"text":"Second time here after a day of golfing. Food is okay, prices okay. Major complaint is service. This is a pub, and it took 20 minutes before someone came to our table and asked if we wanted some drinks. It happened.both times. The place was 75% full, not over packed. Service was so slow and hard to get, i don\"'t think i would come here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place, great place to watch sports, both inside and out--the portions are absolutely huge.

If you're bringing your kids, they'll have to sit outside on the patio.

For our visit we were treated to an 80s montage for our meal... I'd probably go back here again, even though it's in PC :)"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast and lunch! The staff is nice and attentive. I love their food. Everything is so fresh and tasty. Best thing on their appetizer menu is their wings.... Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Typical local bar/local restaurant with food at a great price. I had a 10 oz steak with potato, salad ans sausage for the price of a regular burger practically annywhere else. and the price is even cheaper on sunday and holidays. salad was g8od with over big veggie pieces. baked potato was just that and the steak was exactly what I would have cooked at home (I'm not a good steak chef, but every one else at the table said it was good). Better than your average. good place to watch the local hockey game too. FyI, the pizzaghetti is just pizza and pasta. fromthe name, I was hoping for some sort of pizza with spaghetti toppings."}
{"text":"Just get the roast beef au jus. It can't be beat for the price. This place is your typical hometown bar/cafe where you casually go with friends for a decent burger or sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent déjeuner ! J ai pris un genre d omelette poêle avec pékin de légumes dedans ! Beau bon pas cher ! Très nourrissant ! Excellent service de la part de Sandra :)"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place now for a few years.  They just recently renovated and the bar area looks amazing.  They have sangria on tap and it's actually really good. The menu is nothing crazy, basic food like chicken wings and burgers. The terasse in the summer is nice and big and always full of people."}
{"text":"I like the food definitely worth it on cheapy tuesfay wing night! Best wing ever! They have big pitchers as well most bars and pubs dont have anymore.ordered the steak sub sandwich was good. Game night fun to be in a lot of tv screens and in the summer they have a big terrace you can sit at. Service always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Went in for a late breakfast last weekend. It wasn't the best breakfast experience . The dining room was deserted, aside from a single Customer that was eating his meal slowly. Yet with 2 Waitresses around, we had to wait a while for someone to come take our order. I ordered a florentine and my friend had the eggs Benedict with the smoked salmon. My food for some reason tasted like fish. The fruits on both our plates were very hot. The potatoes were a total disgust. Nothing much to enjoy really! 
Very very bad service, we needed to go out of our way to get the waitress attention every time we needed her. The food itself was terrible.
I wouldn't go back there for a meal that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly cheap and good food.
Great place to watch the game and have a beer."}
{"text":"Yes, The Canadian plate is authentic. Meat pie, ragu au boulettes, pork hock and add a pint. Thats the ultimate hungry mans meal at the Manoir. Service is always good. 2 waiters, one for food and the other for beer."}
{"text":"'The Church' is a traditional hangout on the West Island and it's a great place to sit, drink, and talk. Food is good for a pub, but don't expect 5-star dishes. But then again, you're not paying 5-star prices either!

Check it out. You might like it!"}
{"text":"J'ajoute une étoile de plus suite à ma visite d'hier pour le lunch. 
Nouveau décor, menu revempé etc.
Le service est rapide et vraiment chaleureux par un serveur qui est la depuis longtemps. 
Nous avons commandé 3 différents plats du menu et de la table d'hôte du midi. Pour ma part la poitrine de poulet texmex du menu table d'hôte.  Avec une belle petite salade croquante en entrée , le poulet est bon avec du piquant et gratiné. Les légumes par contre etait fade et trop cuit. Pour le reste, mes voisins de tables ont bien aimé le sandwich Ruben et le burger. Les deux servis avec de bonne frites chaudes et croustillantes. Belle présentation. Grand stationnement."}
{"text":"Il était 13h00 vendredi pour le lunch.
J' étais a la porte et comme l' indiquait le panneau a l' entrée, j' attend qu' on me montre une place. 3 fois le même serveur passe devant moi sans même lever les yeux et m' ignore complètement.
La quatrième fois je l' aborde pour lui dire bonjour et lui demander si il y a quelqu' un qui est assigné a la porte car je poirote. Il a semblé surpris et m' a montre ma table et a voulu rattrapé le mauvais départ en blaguant. Sympathique mais manquait de service client.
Pour le repas ce fut service rapide et la salade césar sur la table d' hôte était excellente avec le poulet grillé sur le grill. Par contre la crème de champignons était épaisse et fade comme si il y avait trop de farine. Que fut le moment de l' addition, aucune trace de mon serveur. Ce fut encore long et pour cette raison je ne recommande pas cet endroit pour le lunch si vous voulez manger et etre servi rapidement."}
{"text":"We came here for a group lunch one weekday afternoon.  Entering the place you could tell it was an older style brasserie (Quebec version of cheap sports bar).  Smell was a bit stanky old beer mixed in with something else funky.  We sauntered off to the veranda - area which had a wood ceiling.  I would concur that this is the nicer place to eat.  I must attest I don't think I've been in a place with more TV's!  I was thinking their electricity bill must be a fortune!  The heat generated must be quite something also.  

Our server was very direct.  I wouldn't quite call it polite but a bit gruff (not too out of the ordinary as expected in a brasserie).  When you deal with drunk patrons in the evening I'd be gruff also!  

I ordered the cream of chicken soup with a smoked meat sandwich.  The soup was okay... a tad too salty.  The smoked meat came in a healthy serving with a pickle.  The smoked meat was more corned beef but was moist and tasty.  A perfect amount of food for me on a weekday. Overall a 3/5 for the food!  

Many people love these places!  Maybe if I was coming to watch a hockey game and slam back half a dozen beers it would be great.  When you are sober and in the daytime it's a bit ewwwwwwwww! 

I'll let you be the judge!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Terrible food. Terrible service. This place used to be good. Now the prices are way up and the quality is way down. Avoid this place like the plague. Nothing good about it."}
{"text":"Le manoir à changé souvent depuis les dernières années. Beaucoup mieux. La nourriture est vraiment bonne ce qui n'a pas toujours été le cas dans le passé. De la poutine au pulled pork à la soupe à l'oignon..toujours bon. Depuis récemment, les choix de bières sont beaucoup plus variés que juste de la Keith. (Mill St., Goose Island, Shock Top) Les prix de la bière sont vraiment abordables comparés à ailleurs. (5$ pinte de Shock top)

La grosse lacune est vraiment dans le service. 
J'ai eu des barmaids excellentes mais y'a aussi des barman qui était vraiment médiocre. Les deux dernières fois, j'ai attendue plus de 10 minutes pour un pichet pendant que c'était mort et pour payer c'est pire. 

Je pense que c'est une place parfaite pour aller en gang pour fêter ou même aller voir un match mais sinon comme bar c'est pas le premier endroit que je recommenderais."}
{"text":"Great selection and variety of tasty food at affordable prices. Also, good place to grab a drink with friends when large sports events are playing."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to go and watch a game or fight. TVs all over the place. Was filled with energy and the food was decent enough and affordable pricing. Our waiter a young man named Xavier was very lively and informative when we asked about what else was in the area. Had a good experience here even though the establishment apparently  has had some very negative backlash last year for kicking out a gay couple(found this out while we were there and I was researching what was good to order). I did not however experience any homophobia while there, but given what the establishment has done, the likelihood of my returning is slim."}
{"text":"This place is alright...has plenty of tvs to watch sports games. The beer selection was fine, but the food was just okay....not great but not bad either. Overall if you are in the area and want to catch a game..it's worth giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch. Fast service and fairly priced. I'll be back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I've seen Manoir through its full transition. Once upon a time, I could go there with friends and expect the place to be empty by 10:30. We'd have the place to ourselves. It was a great place to grab a decent meal with good drink pricing. 

Since then, Manoir has turned into a frat house. The food is all reheated/ready made stuff from Costco and m&m. The cheap beer brings about the cegep shmucks, who are fresh out of their parents' basement, to play quarters. They cheer aloud as they spill beer, break glasses and pretend to like UFC to impress their airheaded arm candies. 

Sinks are now clogged with the puke from the little angels and, if you're lucky, you can catch one of them sprawled on the bathroom floor. The world is a dizzying place when the allowance you get from mommy and daddy can now get you more booze than you can stomach. 

The bouncers are there only to check IDs and look intimidating. When an actual fight breaks out between american eagle and bench, 6'7\" bouncer who can benchpress a tercel is just another bystander.

I must, however, acknowledge that pay-per-view UFC events are always on the TVs and I still go there for the terasse."}
{"text":"If you in for a casual lunch, or meeting, maybe a bite during a sporting event well this is the place to go. My father has been coming here since he was in high school...1970s, and I've being coming here for the past 12-13 years. It is not the fanciest place around, but for a sporting event or sports watching it is a great place to go. During holidays and weekends there are usually deals on the menu, which makes for a great budget saving day during NFL Sundays...my favourite day!

Well to be honest the food is ok, breakfast is my favourite meal or time to here as the lunch and dinner are below my standards for a good meal. But I must say I have no problem coming here for a meal, it will always be a place where I have fond memories, and I place I will continue to visit until I am not longer on this earth."}
{"text":"Good service, minimal selection on eggs whites and veggies (but it was expected ) portion size decent, fresh coffee and oj with breakfast meal. Nice place to watch the games,  many large flat screens, plays soccer, tennis. Hockey.
nice decor, good place to check out in the west island, 
Very laid back place
FYI : no children allowed"}
{"text":"Je mes 5 étoiles mes ya des jours quand j'y vais avec mes parent ça serait des fois 2 ou 3 ou 4 
Et même une fois on aurait mis 1 étoiles tellement que s'était pourrie pour le service 

La nourriture est bon quand même cher pour la qualité 

surtout pour une pizza le manoir à 15$ pis que ça goûte le congèle mes à part ça tout et ok 

Les déjeuner sont très bon pas beaucoup cher pis des grosse portion"}
{"text":"Use to be hype now service sucks, decent prices foods ok, that's it.

TV everywhere."}
