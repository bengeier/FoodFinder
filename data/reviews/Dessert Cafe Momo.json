{"text":"Really cute coffee shop with awesome looking cakes. I had coffee and bingsu( Korean shaved ice dessert) and it was really great. This is the only place in Montreal that has bingsu which is the coolest dessert ever! I want to go back and try the matcha cake yum!"}
{"text":"Bingsoo is a must have at Momo, the right amount of ice and it's not over sweetened! Friendly service, always with a big smile!"}
{"text":"Loved the shaved ice (bingso) here!! I'm from Toronto it's been hard to find these Asian type of shaved ice! The coffee here were delicious too! Going to come back and try some of their cake!"}
{"text":"The matcha shaved ice was great.. Refreshing on a hot day.. A must try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this gem! Cafe Momo is super popular for their bingsoo! I loved the mango one! They stack the bingsoo with mango and mochi and the taste is just heaven on earth!The people are super nice there as well. I would recommend to bring your date, kids, friends and family here! The price is also affordable! If you want to get Korean shaved ice dessert, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"NOW WHERE DO I START. If you've never tried bingsoo, GO NOW! This isn't your regular shaved ice. The ice is made of milk and it's like eating snowflakes as it is shaved so thinly. They come in many flavors: matcha, strawberry, mango, blueberry, injeolmi (korean soy bean base), oreo and espresso (with a gigantic tiramisu on top). Theyre all delicious. This dessert feels light and not too sweet, so i didnt feel guilty at all after doing hot yoga.   They also have other pastries such as tiramisu, matcha cakes, nutella choux, etc. They also have nice coffee and tea if you don't feel like eating.   The place is so cute and the owner is always so nice to us. You always come out of this place with a huge smile on you face.   Bonus tip: if u go there late at night right before their closing time, u might see momo the dog :D"}
{"text":"Delicious Bingsoo, cute decor and friendly staff, this explains the perfect 5 star rating here on Yelp and also on Google.   My husband and I came here for some dessert before heading out for dinner, lol. You know what they say, \"Life is uncertain, eat dessert first!\" I had a small Mango Bingsoo $5.99 and my husband had the Oreo Bomb $3.99.  Bingsoo, for those who aren't familiar with this Korean dessert, is a shaved ice dessert, similar to the Malaysian Ais Kacang, the Filipino Halo-Halo and the Taiwanese shaved snow. The \"ice\" is actually sweetened milk, frozen and then shaved into delicate pieces that resemble finely shredded coconut. It literally melts in your mouth. It's sweet and creamy and tasted heavenly. You can get different toppings and the mango one I ordered came with chunks of mango, mango puree, and mochi (rice cake pieces). It was so incredibly delicious.   I think that I will have to go back to Dessert Cafe Momo everytime I go back to Montreal.   My husband enjoyed his Oreo Bomb. I was going to ask for a taste but by the time I finished taking my pictures he literally finished the whole thing, lol. It was an Oreo flavoured mousse enrobed in chocolate with a tiny Oreo on top.   The cafe is super cute, although there is not that much seating. Staff are really friendly and nice.   The cafe is in the trendy Monkland Village. It's within walking distance from Villa Maria Metro Station."}
{"text":"Small but super cute caf√© near metro Villa-Maria :) I tried their mango bingsoo, iced matcha latte and hot matcha latte and I loooooooved all of them! They also have homemade pastries and they taste amazing. Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe located on Monkland. I was extremely excited to try their bingsoo! I ordered a medium matcha bingsoo, Nutella cream puff and a matcha cake roll. The matcha bingsoo is to die for !  The condensed milk adds an adequate amount of sweetness, and the matcha flavour, red beans and those little sweet rice cakes are such a perfect mix. I really enjoyed those little rice cakes, I might ask for extra next time I visit. ;) The Nutella cream puff was pretty good, the filling was creamy and superb. I had the matcha cake roll later that day, and it was delicious, my bf didn't like it though because of the red beans mixed with the matcha cream, I thought it was good. It added texture and some extra sweetness.  The staffs were also very friendly and the place was very clean. I will definitely visit again. Too bad I don't live around the area anymore, I would probably come here every day for the bingsoo, especially during the summer! Such a refreshing snack."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great prices, beautiful decor! The tea was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! I have tried countless bingsoo cafes and this is the second time I give a 5-stars to one, the first being in Vancouver, the Asian food paradise of Canada. Everything about this place is perfect.  The interior is pretty small and cozy, fitting maybe 12-15 people max. It is nicely decorated with cute lights and pictures. The relaxing Korean music (eg. Bolbbalgan4) fit the atmosphere perfectly.   I tried 4 flavours of bingsoo: tiramisu, matcha, Oreo and injeolmi. The ice equally fluffy and milky but all four were amazing in their own way! The tiramisu bingsoo comes with a piece of tiramisu cake and a pipette of espresso xD. The powder was chocolate flavoured which was perfect for me. The matcha is imported from Japan and has that authentic bitterness. The Oreo cookie chunks were uniform and had the perfect crunchy texture. Finally, the injeolmi actually had corn flakes incorporated in the dessert which made the texture super interesting!   The owners of the shop (named after their extremely cute dog) were suuuper nice as well! I loved my experience and would definitely come back. This cafe definitely makes Montreal proud!"}
{"text":"I tried bingsoo for the first time here, and I was apprehensive at first. My friend described it as \"shaved ice\" and I was imagining the snow cones full of blue syrup that you get at fairgrounds. Of course, I was dead wrong.  It's hard to describe bingsoo. It's like snowflakes of ice cream. Super light, melts in your mouth, but full of flavor. I tried the matcha one, and it was heavenly. The pieces of mochi they add are also delicious and add a bit of chew to the dessert.  The staff is incredibly nice and friendly. I can't wait to go back and try more of their stuff!"}
{"text":"Love this little coffee shop! Such a lovely and cozy place to catch up with friends or study. They serve good coffee and homemade desserts. We tried their bingsoos; a refreshing Korean shaved iced dessert lightly sweetened with condensed milk. The matcha one with smashed red beans is the perfect mid-afternoon snack. It's milky, fluffy and sprinkled with generous amounts of organic matcha powder and chewy rice balls. Our experience was further enhanced by the owner's cheerful disposition. On a street chock full of dessert spots, this cafe definitely stands out!"}
{"text":"Bingsoo frozen dessert is on point, particularly if you like lighter frozen desserts. Cakes and coffee are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Amazing service and coffee. The owner is extremely friendly, always is willing to make suggestions and the lattes are hands down the best I've had in the area :)"}
{"text":"This place has great dessert and I love how artistic it is. The only thing I would say I wasn't pleased with was the man handling our food was coughing and he wasn't covering his mouth & it's a small place so there's no room to sit. Which is understandable they're a small business, plus I needed the dessert to go, so it wasn't that much of a problem. Over all I would recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying bingsoo. Order at the counter and took the large mango bingsoo. The shaved ice was very fine and a lot of syrup on top in the middle and sweetened milk? In the bottom. Very nice people and environment. Definitely returning for the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend, and as someone who has never had the luck of tasting Korean ice-cream before, wow. It was so light. I had the traditional taste but will certainly try the Oreo in the future knowing that it's not too sweet. The serving size seemed generous to me. The owner also charmed me by giving me some free red beans which turned out to be yummy."}
{"text":"The service is so friendly and the matcha bingsoo I had was amazing. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit, so far I tried the Macha Bingsoo, the Oreo Bomb Cake, Macha Roll Cake and the hot Macha Latte. They were all really good and not too sweet, except the oreo bomb, so if you like desserts but can't handle the sweetness this is definitely the place to go.   The inside is pretty small, so I would avoid large groups. It seats like 10 people at most inside, and had 3 tables outside with 6 chairs. But there's a take away option for everything.   It's owned by two people, a man and a woman. I don't know their relationship. But I've noticed it's usually the man who's behind the counter, he's quite friendly and easy to talk to."}
{"text":"My first time having bingsoo and it did not disappoint me. I had the matcha, and my friend had the strawberry. We both finished it in a second! I also had a latte, it was delicious as well. The man was alone on a Saturday afternoon, tending to many people, but was still smiling and welcoming anyone who walked in. All in all, great bingsoo, great service and great atmosphere! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really good coffee and cakes. Very cozy clean space and very friendly owners. Strawberry shortcake and sweet potato cake are to die for!"}
{"text":"On my first visit, I had the mango cheesecake, and boy was it tasty! On my second visit, I had the mango bingsoo, and it was phenomenal. It's a dessert of shaved ice, and it tastes delightful. I will be coming back soon to this new Korean dessert/coffee house, to try more! Very friendly service, and cute aesthetic."}
{"text":"A place where you can eat korean style ice cream and pet a dog! What else could you ask for, hein?"}
{"text":"Cute tiny joint with a good variety of korean desserts. The place fills up fast so have a take out back up plan. Mango binsoo was good, although I have nothing to compare. My partner took red velvet cake which he also enjoyed."}
{"text":"I took the matcha bingsoo and it tasted amazing! I did not have high expectations for some reason, but after eating there, I would go back. It is a bit pricey, but we don't have a lot of those in Montreal."}
{"text":"Super good luck tonight, we arrived at MoMo on monkland just as they were closing.......but abt 8 teens came rushed behind us and made such sad faces, (they also happens to be regulars from their conversation) that the store decided to open for all of us!   Scored the best shaved ice I had in years!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little new coffee shop on Monkland , I had been meaning to try since it opened. The service was very friendly and helpful and the shop was clean and modern looking, a nice place for an afternoon tea/coffee or snack (definitely not enough seating for a group though). I tried the strawberry matcha cake and really enjoyed it - nice fluffy cake with enough matcha taste to it without being overpowering, fresh strawberries and a nice light cream inside. The cake was very good so I would definitely like to go back and try one of their beverages and let's be honest probably some more dessert lol They also serve a shaved ice dessert that seems like it would be great in the summer time , so I'll probably go back for that as well when the weather warms up ! They accept cash or card payments. The only thing I can say is that when I went on an early Sunday afternoon there already wasn't much choice of pastries left even though the shop was not super full , but at least I really enjoyed the one I got !"}
{"text":"Cozy little place with very tasty korean/Japanese style dessert. They have a slogan, \"Life is too short for bad coffee\". I like it! They have great coffee! Espresso and their well known matcha latte.  Their korean frozen snow sorbet is a must try!! Go with Mango! I personally think it's the better one! For cake, can't go wrong with the Matcha roll cake, true Matcha from Japan with Matcha cream.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW! I loved Momo really a lot because they really make the best bingsoo, in fact I just came back from Asia, where I tried many cold drinks and desserts, but the Korean shaved ice is definitely amazing! I wanted to try this dessert place since a very long time and finally I got the chance: and I wasn't let down! I picked the matcha and mango bingsoo, it was 25 degrees outside so it's just right temperature for some cold desserts. Located on Monkland, this Korean Caf√© is not very easy to spot at first, but it offers a quiet environment to relax. There are several flavours to choose for bingsoo, some more fruity and other more creamy, matcha is my coup-de-c¬úur, not very sweet and very aromatic, savoury and refreshing. I would like to try more flavours next time!"}
{"text":"I am really happy my friend discovered this little shop. It is the perfect dessert shop that caters to an Asian palate, or to anyone who wants a \"not too sweet\" dessert. Their bingsoo is amazing. I just have the injeolmi bingsoo and it had a very subtle sweetness to it and some surprise crispiness brought on by cereal flakes. It was the perfect after-supper treat.   If I have one complaint, it's that the rag they use to clean the table leaves a  pungent smell that lingers for longer than one hopes for, but hopefully they will see the review and resolve the issue shortly!"}
{"text":"Bon service, qq tables √† l'interieur et d'autres dans mini terrasse, th√© et dessert, agreable ambiance. Ca ferme √† 10pm."}
{"text":"The service was pretty excellent and the guy was super friendly and welcoming. We had two different bingsu and they were both equally delicious. The store is small but cozy and definitely a go to. A fun fact it that momo is the name of their dog and that's where they got the name, making it an even more enjoyable visit. (Dog wasn't there but pictures of it were!)  Update: we passed by again later and momo was right outside the store!!! Highly recommended and the man even noticed us noticing momo and smiled at us :)"}
