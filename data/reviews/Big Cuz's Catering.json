It was so flavorful because they stuffed it with apples and peppers and all this good stuff I would've never thought of adding. We also had the brisket... that was my fav!! It was swimming in juice and just delicious. Next, was the ham which was also really good. Lastly,  the Mac and cheese and dressing. The dressing..
