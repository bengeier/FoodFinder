{"text":"Came here in early August for an awesome meal. They have a cozy little back patio that's not only super cute, but makes you feel you're out of the city. Saturday's is $1 oysters, so we started with those and they were a very nice treat. I had the Mac & Cheese (which I'm super picky about) and it was very delicious (Note, I did take home a fair amount and it was VERY greasy when re-heated, so try and eat most when served fresh). My husband said his burger was great."}
{"text":"An excellent new restaurant in Toronto's Bloor West Village, Stratosphere provides diners that are looking for a new or hidden gem with an eclectic menu that is executed with aplomb and a friendly upscale atmosphere.

Southern Fried Chicken with Maple Syrup and Waffles was spectacular.  Diners looking for seafood first will love the Crispy Salmon with Jerusalem Artichoke Purée.  Lots of additional unique menu items demand a return visit."}
{"text":"Decided to try it for the first time and found it okay.  We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty quiet. The ambience was nice and laid back. There was a couple dating it seemed at the back and even got up to do a little dancing. We as a family also felt comfortable with the surroundings.  They only had the Winterlicious menu available which I was a little disappointed as we had brought our kids and wanted them to split an appetizer and main instead of having a kid's meal.  They waiter was helpful in providing options for the kids and he was nice but never made much eye contact.  Our appetizer was mussels which we like a lot and the portion was good.  The mains were cooked very well ie. they knew how to cook a steak fillet properly and shrimp were cooked just right also.  Dessert we found good and good portions.Will come again."}
{"text":"Tonight was our third visit and we are really impressed by the consistency of the delicious food, the excellent service and the friendly atmosphere.  This place is both perfect for a date and a family outing, it's both intimate and kid friendly.

This is the type of place that's missing from the Kingsway.  We love the spicy shrimps, wings and mussels, Saturdays are oyster nights and the mains are all very tasty and well prepared.  We really do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A fairly new restaurant, we decided to try it out for Brunch in October and were suitably impressed and returned in November. First, the food is a fresh take on classic dishes and there is definitely ample quantity for big appetites. Our first time, my partner and I met a friend who had just flown in from Spain (so it was more like her supper). She had the Huevos Rancheros and ate every bite, and said she'd enjoyed it very much. I had the Chicken Club made with buttermilk chicken  - it was delicious and my partner enjoyed the eEgs Benedict. The next time I tried the Huevos Rancheros and while good, I would have enjoyed it more had more of the ingredients been warm - the poached eggs were warm but perched on top of kind of cold black beans etc. My partner had the Avocado Toast and while he liked it, he said he'd go back to the Eggs Benedict next time.

Secondly the service - Jay is great: personable, knowledgeable and helpful. He recommended a white wine (the name escapes me) that was made from a recently revived grape that he described as Pinot Grigio on steroids! It was delightful. Our second time there, he was training a new server and it was fairly busy so the service was a bit slower but still we left feeling like we were already appreciated regulars. We will go back."}
{"text":"How do I give 0 stars? I don't know what was worse - the food, the customer service, or the ignorance of very basic running a restaurant. The other reviews on here must be friends of the owner, because they were the only other people there and certainly got more attention than the paying customers. First impressions didn't seem very important to the staff nor owner."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that our visit was the first night of Winterlicious - our server said the restaurant was unusually busy.  It was our first visit to Table 21 and we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
** FOOD - food was tasty, although main and dessert portions seemed small (maybe due to Winterlicious?).  Time between courses was too long.  My apple crumble was served missing the crumble on top.    No one returned to check in as we ate dessert so couldn't get it fixed.  The server ended up taking it off the bill at the end which was a nice gesture.  My husband's cheesecake was ridiculously small.
** SERVICE - started out well, offered drinks shortly after being seated and they took our food orders quickly.  I was actually getting worried that they would try to rush our visit.  But then more diners arrived & it got busy.  We went lonnnnnnnng stretches without any service.  Water was refilled most of the time (which I always appreciate).  Husband ordered beer at start of entree, which hadn't arrived by the time he was finished.  Server offered a sincere apology at the end of our meal for the service - they just seemed overwhelmed with a full house.
** AMBIANCE - liked the decor and feel of the place overall.  The TV's at the bar seemed out of place though and I would prefer the restaurant without TV.  Would get a little cold as people entered the restaurant and cold air would blow in so ask for a table near the back if that concerns you.
** VALUE - It was very extremely good value in terms of the price paid given the Winterlicious menu - $28 per person for dinner and the food was tasty overall, even though the service, time between courses and portion sizes left a little to be desired.
We would give Table 21 another chance in the hopes they would be better on a non-Winterlicious night.  We saw a kids menu which looked great, and would consider returning as a family too."}
{"text":"The brand new Table 21 Kitchen & Wine Bar is located at 2956 Bloor Street West in West Toronto (Etobicoke). Table 21 Kitchen & Wine Bar was formerly called Stratosphere Gastrolounge and Wine Bar but has now been newly renovated and reimagined with a new chef, new name, and new signage.  

Some foodies and fellow community members were invited to this launch party where there was an assortment of appetizers and drinks available for us to try. It was a standing cocktail party with tables and chairs available on a first-come-first-serve basis.  There were some sample wines and beers available for tasting. In terms of the food, we enjoyed some Korean-style chicken wings, meatballs in a tomoto sauce, spicy shrimp on crostini, and chicken tacos. I really enjoyed the finger food and wished there were more!"}
{"text":"I recently ate at Stratosphere Gastropub in Etobicoke and had a fantastic experience from top to bottom. 

The service was warm and attentive, the atmosphere was sophisticated bit not pretentious, and the food was phenomenal.

I can't recommend this place enough. Can't wait to make it a regular spot!

Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Three of us had Summerlicious lunch (July 24, 2016) and we were not impressed. We should've known from the menu options that it may not be so good as each of the 3 main entree courses consists of New Orleans, Indian and Italian cuisine. It would've been great if the chef executed the dishes true to their regions but failed to do so. We all found the food too bland (and I tend to like my food bland but this was just not satisfying). If you're looking for flavour, this isn't the restaurant for you. Atmosphere was okay, flies were kind of annoying and service was okay but a bit on the stale and strange side."}
{"text":"Was great ! All portion sizes were generous and menu descriptions accurate.  The beet salad, shrimp tacos and the fried zucchini were.standouts and the ambiance and service was.great"}
{"text":"Not great ambience. The food was fine though.
Our wait staff was preoccupied with other tables.
No coffee or dessert was offered.
Our table would likely not return."}
{"text":"So impressed with their service and food. Everything was delicious. The ambience of the resturant is lovely and the staff is so kind. I make sure to come here whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cruising through neatly-manicured, tree-lined streets, past stunning multi-million dollar homes and picture perfect families, we made our way to Stratosphere, a casual dining Gastropub & Winebar located in Etobicoke's Bloor West Village. Parking is aplenty, and for those that prefer not to drive, the restaurant has the added convenience of being situated next to a TTC subway station.

The outside makes no grand statements. But as we enter, I'm almost taken back to a prohibition-era speakeasy. The background jazz music, dark furnishings, and skyline mural definitely helps my daylight reverie.

With an opportunity to sample a few of the appetizers, we got to taste a wide range of textures and flavours. The fish tacos packed a good punch (despite the hard taco shell which could make for a crumbly eat); the Mediterranean-styled olive tapenade served with focaccia was a savoury bite; and the Guinness beer-battered prawns were surprisingly light and crunchy.

But it was the sliders that took home the big win. Made with a delectable combination of beef, lamb and striploin, these mini burgers hit all the right spots - tasty, succulent and juicy. The triumph of four very good appetizers set expectations pretty high for the main course that followed. If Stratosphere's mini sliders were anything to go by, the big daddy version held a lot of promise. The Strip Loin Burger was a big, juicy hand-pressed patty, served with crispy fried onions, mushrooms, and 3 sauces on a bed of sweet potato fries.

When it comes to cocktails, Stratosphere does shine bright - among its lovely libations was a Bloody Ceasar that was right on the mark, and a smooth chocolate martini that would have had me going back for more had it not been a school night.

Overall, Stratosphere has the potential of being a great local for the Royal York residents. Come for the cocktails, stay for those appetizers. And make sure to check out the backyard patio and some of the weekday specials: Buck-a-Shuck oysters every Saturday, and the Bring Your Own Wine no-corkage every Wednesday."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at La Veranda (see https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-veranda-osteria-toronto-2) we went looking for s Sunday afternoon alternative and found Stratosphere.
The service was perfect, the wine reasonably priced (unlike La Veranda selection) and the appetizer of short rib tacos was excellent.
With no corkage Wed, Jazz on other nights, we will definitely return for dinners. La Verandas loss is our gain as we found this gem."}
{"text":"The Kingsway neighborhood is home to several restaurants that has operated for many years. Stratosphere Gastrolounge & Winebar is one of the newer additions to the area having been opened for less than a year. They opened in the summer of 2015, and recently re-branded themselves as a \"gastrolounge\". The restaurant offers global cuisine in a rather spacious family dining setting with a monochromatic interior. I was told that the menu was also recently revamped to center on offering familiar gastropub fare with a more elevated flair. Stratosphere is open Monday to Sunday, and is located in the Etobicoke area of West Toronto with plenty of street parking available. 

The cocktail menu at Stratosphere Gastrolounge & Winebar features a great selection of infused-cocktails, where they combine liquors with fresh, seasonal ingredients. They're the only place in the surrounding area serving infused-cocktails, so I thought that it was an interesting concept. We opted to try the Strawberry Infused Rum Daiquiri (1.5 oz) - lime juice, simple syrup, sugar rim.

We started off with the mussels ($12) - served in a garlic white wine sauce, and they were quickly devoured. The generous portion of mussels was marinated in a flavorful white wine sauce, which was rather fragrant. The mussels themselves were plump, and tasted great! 

I love chicken wings, so the Stratosphere \"Twice Cooked\" Wings ($14 - 1 lbs) - your choice of jerk, cajun, lemon pepper, mild, medium, hot, BBQ, was a must-order for me. The chef was nice enough to allow me to try two different flavors; lemon pepper, and jerk. Personally, I enjoyed the jerk wings more as it contained a lot more flavors compared to the lemon pepper wings.

The STRATOSPHERE Beef Burger ($17) - 9 oz. AAA ground sirloin with all the trimmings, served with hand cut fries, is their house specialty. All of the burgers on the menu are made in-house featuring ingredients that are sourced locally. However, I do find the burger to be priced a little too high.

For my entree, I opted for the Spaghetti di Mare ($19) - prawns, mussels, calamari, in a spicy tomato sauce. The spaghetti dish was simply presented on a white plate giving it a clean presentation look. The flavorful seafood spaghetti contained a healthy helping of seafood; prawns, mussels, and calamari mixed with a spicy tomato sauce. Overall, the spaghetti was executed nicely as the noodles weren't overcooked and the sauce helped to enhance the flavor of the seafood. 

To end off the meal,  I got the crème brûlée as my dessert. The dessert consisted of a rich custard base topped off with caramelized sugar making it a satisfying end to the night!
