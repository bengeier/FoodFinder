{"text":"This is the sort of place you need to experience more than once as the menu is constantly changing. When you come in, you will be greeted by one of the friendly staff who will ask you to pick from their simple yet unique menu board.  Options sometimes include menu items like Seasonal Watermelon Gazpacho, breakfast poutine and Eggs Benedict with a fresh take on hollondaise sauce with dill.  

Speaking with the owner, Kim, her approach to the menu is focused on fresh ingredients and an ever changing menu that will bring guests back again and again.  If you ask for hot sauce here, you can be sure it's made in house.

Although there is no hostess to greet you when you first arrive, the hospitality is above any other, making the experience at Hello Darling one to cherish and bring you back.  

I had their gazpacho, which I ordered in haste as I don't normally like watermelon.  Although the watermelon is the star of the dish, it was spiced perfectly allowing each spoonful to bring heat, sweetness and saltiness to savour the whole bowl.

The eggs from each dish I've had here have been cooked perfectly everytime, though I could have done without the potatoes. Perhaps if they were smaller and crispier they would have completed the dish.  

As Hello Darling is fairly new, Kim has managed to keep the idea of fresh and delicious on the top of her priorities.  This place is one that keeps getting better and better with each visit, and it's a gem that I would entice anyone to visit once and try not coming back to."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is delicious, however be prepared to spend your whole morning waiting for food and service. When we arrived we were told it would be about 25 minutes for a table. We waited one hour and ten minutes after the server sat two large groups ahead of us who came in after us. We expected to wait but it the whole system of seating and communication was lacking and chaotic. Then we waited 20 minutes for even water at the table - although delivered water to all the tables around us first. The server was a bit rude and aloof when we asked for water and was really slow generally. Food arrived - one order had bacon instead of coconut bacon so we had to wait for that and we also had no cutlery until one of us got up after about ten minutes . The bill never came so we went up and paid. All in all over two and a half hours for brunch, so I duno. I'm all down for the chill vibe but better process would be beneficial because I likely will not attend again."}
{"text":"Admittedly, we're the brunch type. We dig Hello Darlings 'egg' window - a yellow dot on the outside pane so when they pull down the white curtain on the inside - voila. Egg. Unfortunately the decent reviews we've heard so far didn't thrill us far past the creative window.

We were greeted by a very timid server, pointing us to where we could sit (we sat a part of the long row of tables nearest the front entrance). Immediately, the tables on either side had to be shifted, by the other patrons dining beside us, just so I could squeeze in to the bench seat. As my partner commented, if he \"stretched his arms out\" he could \"literally hug the person next to him, and the person next to that\". It was tight, but 'c'est la vie' in Toronto.

Unimpressive coffee ($2.50) and freshly squeezed orange juice ($4) in too small of a glass to be seen as of value. 

My brunch partner in crime and I both couldn't resist the promise of a breakfast poutine (hashbrowns, mushroom gravy, cheese curd, two over-easy/medium eggs w/ sides of a biscuit, salad and fruit) ($14). 

After waiting more that 30mins for our meals we got a taste: overall we left full, and pretty content. Unfortunately, we've also got high expectations of a glorified breakfast that we are spending $25 EACH on with tax and tip. 

A couple bites of hashbrowns were under cooked. I get weak in the knees for a savoury mushroom gravy so this one was too sweet to my liking. The biscuit as well is sweet - if you're into that then this is the place for you - not for me, sadly. The half cup of mixed green salad with a couple sticks of apple and carrot was poorly dressed. The pickled radishes on top were a delightful surprise and beautiful colour contrast. The fruit was fruit (1 strawberry, 1 grape (literally one), 1 perfectly ripe slice of thick honeydew and 1/5th of a kiwi). 

I appreciated having different flavours in front of me - to jump from salad to biscuit to poutine is exactly how I enjoy eating. However, none of the components of this spread were done overly well. It was a bit of a flop for us.

We asked for our bill and took it to the cash register to pay. The empty pastry fridge looked sad. The open kitchen in the back allowed us a gander: to us it looked as though they are working with one flattop only. The lack of burners seemed to be what kept our meals from reaching us in an acceptable time.

All in all, we'll avoid this brunch spot in the future. We simply can't justify the $25 spent when the overall experience wasn't delightful. Best wishes to the Hello Darling team as they continue to grow and be a welcome addition to this developing  neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After a red eye flight to YYZ, my dear friend picked me up from the airport and took me to this place to get some food as I was staaaarving! As we walked in, this place put a smile on my face, the place smelled so good, and I ordered the mushroom wellington! (I was hungry!!) As a weekday vegetarian, this was the perfect place as it really hit the spot. Good to have friends who are chefs!"}
{"text":"The \"Poppy pancakes +  Lemon curd blackberries\" and the hot \"Pear Ginger Nutmeg\" were the highlight of my brunch.

Nicely decorated bright space, fun tea pots and mugs add to the atmosphere. Very thoughtful to have the pillows on the bench and a large blue curtain at the door to block the cold and allow for a comfortable sit-down near the entrance."}
{"text":"Great brunch place with the kids. Kids get to pick what they want on their plate and the other \"normal\" items are great and varied. The biscuit sandwich was great.

There is also a selection of toys and coloring books at the rear to keyed the kiddos occupied. Service is a little slow but it goes with the low key feel of this place. I don't mind waiting for a bit with coffee in hand."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try this place out for a while, and finally had a chance a couple weeks ago. The space is nice - bright and airy, and with decor reminiscent of Saving Grace (where I believe the Hello Darling owner used to work). It was on the late end of brunch hours, and we were seated right away.

Upon seeing the menu (i.e., the chalkboard), I was pleasantly surprised with how vegetarian-friendly it was. I ended up ordering their standard eggs and toast (boring, I know), along with their vegan coconut 'bacon'. 

Everything was great - I wasn't blown away by any part of it, but I also ordered a fairly basic meal. One thing of note was the large serving size - the eggs and toast come with salad, hash, and some fruit, and it was enough food that I struggled to finish it.

Our server was friendly and the whole place had a nice, relaxed feeling where everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"3.5 slow eating and service but good wholesome food. Lunch with club sandwich, coffee and cookie. Nice open space with quaint decor. I recommend expanding take out food or add market space for lunch patrons. Pricing is a bit high for location."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out for the first time with a friend. Loved it! I ordered the Sunflower bowl and it was great. Just the right serving size. Rice, chickpea hash, beets, just to name a few of the veggies. The flavor, exceptional. The Americanos are delish as well. Really great service, great vibe. Liked the little muffin at the end with the cheque as well. Nice touch. Well worth the $$. Recommend, yes!"}
{"text":"I still think about the delicious brunch I had at Hello Darling over a month ago! I recently moved out of the neighbourhood, but will return specifically to eat here again. Each menu option sounded so appealing, but I finally decided on a flavourful eggs florentine - not on a english muffin, but on a delicious house-made onion tart. Yum! My friend also really enjoyed her selection, the chili. The people setting next to us were on brunch pt. 2 - an order of lemon-poppy pancakes topped with blueberries (I believe) - because they enjoyed their brunch mains so much. And this was all in a sunny and simplistically cute space. Very pleasant all around! I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Quality food, amazing service , great ambience and reasonably priced.  Best way to avoid chain places and get the most"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some old friends today for brunch which was excellent.  I had the club sandwhich, which was piled high with great fixings, including avocado which is key.  Fresh grapefruit juice, and side breakfast sausages which were also great.   Really nice home fries as well.
Prompt and polite service!"}
{"text":"This review is based on a few visits I've had here over the last year or so with my partner, but mostly on our last experience.  

During previous visits, which are usually on a Saturday or Sunday morning, we've come and had to wait for a table or for our food, which is not the end of the world and never really bothered us too much. The food is generally quite superb and well worth the wait (especially the lemon poppy seed pancakes!).

On our last visit, this past Sunday morning, we came in around 10am and looked like there was two empty tables (two separate tables for 2) and that we wouldn't have to wait long. We asked the server if we could sit, she began to explain that the tables were reserved for a party of 6. We thought this was odd given that they don't take reservations, so we asked \"Do you guys take reservations?\" She explained that they \"usually don't\" but someone called that either used to work there or knows someone that works there (can't remember the exact reason). 

At this point we were both quite perturbed, considering we were staring at two empty tables in front of us and no line up. She said there would be about a 20 min wait for the next table, so we decided to head somewhere else. 

The server was very nice about the whole thing, it seemed like she didn't really agree with the whole situation and was likely just the messenger. Never the less they still made exceptions to their own rules, if they don't take reservations, then they shouldn't take reservations, pretty simple stuff. There is a very good chance we won't be returning based on this poor experience."}
{"text":"Good food, slow service. Came in for brunch on a Sunday and were seated, only to be kicked out of our spot and moved to a spot at the bar because the server who sat us made a mistake. The bar spot was nice enough, good for people watching but service was dismal as we were at the furthest point from the kitchen and the waitstaff seemed to forget about us. 

I had the two eggs over easy with coconut bacon and subbed a biscuit. Biscuit was more spongy than crumbly, ketchup and hot sauce served on the side were delicious. Coconut bacon was average. My fiancée had plenty of gluten free options, she had the sunny eggs on a corn tortilla with mashed sweet potatoes and black beans -- super good, and there were a lot of pickled veggies on the side that added a nice flavour. 

Overall, service was friendly but very slow -- make sure you're not in a rush!"}
{"text":"We liked this place. It was cute, relaxed and friendly. The brunch was quality, fairly creative, and from-scratch (inc. the preserves, ketchup and pepper sauce). The pancakes, though non-traditional--more like poppyseed cakes with lemon curd, not syrup--had a good sweet-tart balance. The (squash,leek,cauliflower,chevre) omelette, too, had well-balanced flavour. The accompanying rye was tasty (but could have been better toasted). The coffee was decent, the washrooms clean, the music good. The tables were a bit close, though. Maybe a speaker in the dining area would help with audio privacy, as would giving over some of the ample prep area to more well-spaced seating. We'll be back. Hello Darling--and the surrounding Lansdowne-Wallace area in general--are pretty charming."}
{"text":"Great Service. Cute little spot. Good coffee. 

You can't really mess up bacon eggs and toast. Was expecting a good meal for the price of it alone. Bacon was way over cooked. Eggs we're good. Potatoes tasted like they were sitting out for a while and were reheated. Server was lovely. Atmosphere was awesome. I definitely want to go back and try something else but to be honest I was really disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and home made (even the ketchup!) Options for gluten free too. Great casual ambiance. One of the tastiest meals I've had in Toronto. Great if you love eggs and brunch."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be a hip brunch spot but the food needs improvement.  In terms of the regular breakfast; the eggs were average, the stringed-out potatoes were not that tasty, and the side salad felt like it was right out of a bag.  The Shakshouka had almost no spice flavour in it and the hummus and baba ganoush on the side were kind of dry - I'd stay away from this dish.  Someone in my party tried the pancakes and said they were pretty good.  I don't know what to say.  This place has a nice casual, hipsterish atmosphere but needs to step up the flavour quotient."}
{"text":"Yummy spot for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  Had the 2 egg with bacon, it comes with toast, coleslaw or green salad, and roasted potatoes. Then had the smaller portion of poppy seed pancakes topped with whipped cream and a delicious lemon curd. Ask for the blue berry jam too  they were spot on."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here all the time. The Sunflower chickpea scramble is my favorite thing to eat in the world. The staff are amazing - so friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so close to me and I don't even know why I didn't go until last weekend, it is a great, sunny, colourful place to have a nice brunch.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and we didn't have to wait for a table, although it was packed. Decided to order the biscuit sandwich and it was so delicious - lots of flavour contrasts going on, bread was crunchy and sweet, pickled onions added an acid touch that I loved and worked well with the cheddar, eggs were well cooked. Really yummy.

I didn't like that they don't have Menus, they write all the menu items and its prices on a black board. Would have liked to have a menu in my hand to be able to think about my order while sitting on the table. I could barely read all the menu options because I was a bit stressed out standing there in the middle of the hallway with lots of people coming and going - I finally took a pic of the board with my phone, but not an ideal situation.

Also this is such a tiny detail but I was really surprised by their homemade ketchup - it was fresh, tasty, not too sweet. They really put a lot of effort into serving 100% fresh and homemade meals, which is something I always enjoy and appreciate.

I'm going to repeat soon for sure, gotta try those Benny and the Club sandwich looked really tasty too."}
{"text":"I really don't want to drop a 2 star on this place as it's cute on the inside and I know they have a lot of potential.  It's like stepping in to your 94 year old neighbours house and sitting down to a nice brunch or breakfast.  The only difference here is, your 94 year old neighbour could probably out cook a set of eggs better than any of the chefs at Hello Darling.

Imma start off first by saying, please invest in Menus guys.  It's cool you have all the items on your menu written on the black board in the middle of the restaurant, but when there's a crowd of people all looking at it at the same time, it just causes chaos and confusion.  Not only for the customers, but for the servers too.  There was only one poor girl working the entire restaurant, and on top of the slew of orders she got wrong for our table, our food came out mad late.  I'm talking, you gotta make excuses to your boss for coming back from lunch 2 hours late kinda deal.  It's aight, my cat is sick and I had a dentist appointment knowmsayin?

Overall this place deserves a 1 star for the food because my quesadilla was probably the weakest I've ever had, but imma give it two for the server who was working it hard.  I hate to say this, but Goodbye Darling!"}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed with the overall experience. 

Biz wasn't very busy and it took a good half hour to get out food on the table from the moment the server left with our order. This is brunch, eggs, potatoes and a bit of greens so it shouldn't take that long. I have been to places, the farmers tavern to mention one, where the quality bathe complexity of the brunch was far superior and the food took overall at least half of the time. 

First we got the coffee served: 4 different cups with 4 different capacities: one was the size of a double espresso :S
We have been asked if we wanted milk or cream. We provided our input and the server a minute after already forgot what we asked so that we had to remind her after several minutes that we were still waiting for the milk and cream. 

Food overall was super: the home potatoes were diced up so tiny that using the fork to eat them posed a challenge to all of us. On top of that, the potatoes tasted oily. 

The Benny eggs aren't the usual Benny: here they use sour cream with a sprinkle of chive on it. 
Let's move on. 

The whole brunch was way overpriced if considered the size of the portions and the flavour overall. Definitely not the type of experience I would have for the value of my money. 

Positive note, when we asked the bill, it came on a little tray with some mini banana muffins. 

In general the food seemed not frozen or processed but again, it doesn't justify the cost and not the passion pit to cook it along a distracted and slow service. 

I don't think I'll come back again. There are better choices out there that I personally think are better value for my money. 

But this is just my personal opinion. Sorry :)"}
{"text":"I was pretty decided after my first visit it definitely would not be my last! I want to take everyone I know that loves brunching with me to this resto! It's an instant favorite! I'm not even a sweets person, but I had a craving for pumpkin that morning. I ordered the half-pumpkin pancakes which came with roasted coconut shavings (which is referred to as bacon). I recommend the date/almond/banana smoothie for a special treat! It is a must visit! Totally worth the trip!"}
{"text":"My partner and I joined another couple for Sunday brunch here a few weeks back. The location was perfect for us, and we love supporting small businesses in this city, so we figured it looked cute and we would give it a try. 

We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes, and they needed to clear some tables, which was fine. The menu was small, but since there was a sign out front singing the praises of their pizzas, we decided to all go for that, which we decided in line. We waited for 45 minutes before we were seated, which we know can happen, and we were patient and good natured at this point. Then it took them another 20 minutes before we even received any coffee. There was a larger table of people who arrived after us and sat down beside us, and another table of 4 on the other side of us. The large table got their food almost a full 20 minutes before we did. 

I will say that the drinks they served were fantastic, and well priced. I was hoping to have a meal that followed suit. There were 4 personal pizzas ordered, and one of them was significantly smaller than the others. When asked about the discrepnacy, the waitress told us that every pizza they make is special, and is different, like snowflakes are. After waiting over an hour for said snowflake, let's just say the person who received it was not impressed.

It wasn't in the nature of anyone in my party to complain or make a fuss about anything, we just wanted to be treated well, receive good service and have a great meal out. None of us left feeling good about this place. We all left wishing we had gone down the street to Starving Artist, or any number of the places just south on Bloor."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot in the neighbourhood. I've gone many times and never had a problem with wait times beyond what you'd expect from a small operation where everything is made fresh. The offerings are all twists on what you'd find elsewhere, featuring way more flavours and colours. My favourite is the pancake sandwich. Also a great place to bring kids."}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch on New Year's Day. Was a long wait to get a table. This might be expected on New Year's Day for Brunch. My issue is that the reason it was so long is because the food was taking waaaaaaay too long to come out from the kitchen. Once we finally ordered, it must've been over 45 minutes before we ate. They seemed totally unprepared for how busy it was. I heard them mention being out of several items, including orange juice. Their menu is pretty limited making this a bit of a bigger deal.

The food itself was good. My guest ordered the pancakes and without asking they assumed he wanted the half order. After waiting so long for the meals to arrive, this was a little underwhelming and disappointing. But we sure as hell weren't sending anything back at that point. Funny enough, when we got our cheque, they proceeded to charge us for the full order. They quickly fixed this though.

The decor was cute, the food was good, and the coffee was absolutely delicious. But there are waaaaaaaay too many Brunch places in Toronto for me to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"On a recent, now run-of-the-mill, \"extreme cold warning\" weekend winter wonderland, my party of four decided to brave the instant-icicle-inducing chillzone for some brunch. We arrived at 10am, to avoid any lineups, and that we did. 

While we were seated right away, our food did not follow until about an hour later. Though some of that time undoubtedly went to deciding between the numerous appetizing specials on the board (there are no table menus at Darling) our meals were not instant. Thankfully, we were in no rush, and during the wait our server was eager to refill our hot coffee mugs numerous times. 

The food was delicious, though not mind-blowing - normally not a concern, but the prices indicate our reaction should have been otherwise. Three of us had ordered some incarnation of a Huevos Rancheros Benny. The eggs were cooked well, the hashbrowns were perhaps over-crunchy if I might quibble, but overall the dish was pleasant. My GF and I split a cuban breakfast sandwich which was definitely a highlight.

To sum: the food is good, the space is quaint, the service is adequate, but the prices simply don't qualify. If they were a little lower I would certainly consider saying Hello to Hello Darling more often."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since they opened on a regular basis since our home is just up the street.   At first we were a little nervous as we are neither vegan nor vegetarian, but the dishes delight even meat lovers. They're flavourful and creative, and there's always the option to order a side of bacon or sausage if you just can't do without meat (which we cannot).   Even though the dishes are light and healthy (well maybe not the apple cake french toast...), they're also quite filling, leaving us satiated for quite some time afterwards.

 The menu changes regularly and is written out on a little chalk board, but there's always a variation of a pancake and an egg dish available. The dishes are creative, expect unusual offerings like coconut bacon (fried coconut meat... to die for!), and mushroom wellington. Familiar favourites make the menu as well, like huevos rancheros. All the produce is always very fresh and breads are fluffy. Everything can be spiced up with their powerful hot sauce. If you're not into hot stuff, you might be pleased to hear that they make their own ketchup!   The coffee is delicious, rich without being acidic or bitter.  We absolutely love their smoothies, interesting flavour combos that are always well  balanced.  

The space itself reminds one of a sunny cafe, with tables close together and an option to sit at a bar set inside the window where you can watch the world go by as you eat,  our favourite spot.   When it's very busy it can get a little loud, but that's because it seems to attract a natural air of vibrancy. The staff is attentive, but this is a small establishment with the owner in the kitchen and friends and family acting as wait staff.   Service can be a bit slow when a rush of people show up at once, be patient, they're always doing their best and they're all such lovely people!   I personally love the tableware, the plates and glasses are inexpensive vintage pieces you might find at Value Village, charming and homey with no two alike."}
{"text":"So cute, loved all the mismatch drinkwear, bright and beautiful, great quiet location, and the food was INCREDIBLE. Everything we had was a step above what I expected. I think this is my new fav breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Such a cute brunch spot. Came here on a weds morning around 10:30am and it was easy to get a table for three. The menu is on a board against the wall right across from our table. We ordered lattes and coffee first as we looked at the menu. Decided to go with the Benny since it's made differently than most places. Service was friendly and never rushed. The egg Benny was so good - highly recommend it if you're interested in a different take on Benny's. They also have mini banana muffins and a few cookie selection. We went ahead and ordered two cookies to split and they were honestly so delicious! Definitely stopping back for their cookies if I'm ever around the area again."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast mainly due to lack of options. When we were seated - after waiting 3x as long as the \"10 minutes\" we were initially promised, I remembered why this was not our first pick: all the reports of slow service. We waited 15 minutes for coffee! Seriously, after the interminable wait for a table, at least bring the coffee out quickly. (for example: Boom Breakfast on College serves coffee and waffles to people in the lineup! Now that is service!)

Another reason this was not our first pick: lack of eggs benedict. Oh sure, they have something called \"eggs benny,\" and it has eggs, but with an assortment of random other ingredients to the extent that reading the description was just sad-making. Think up a different name for your strange breakfast, I'm sure it is lovely for people who want something that is NOT eggs benedict.

When breakfast finally arrived it was all right - the sausages were nice - but not worth what they're charging. And the kid's breakfast was teeny tiny. 

Also, it is super loud. It's like the walls are designed to amplify every conversation and blast you. Ugh.

Most important of all, it left me with a bit of an upset stomach that is still upset three hours later.

Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Very cute family friendly place. We went near the opening so it looks like they're still working out some kinks as the order took awhile to come. But the staff were very friendly and offered us coffee and sweets as we wait. The standard breakfast was nothing special. The french toast was delicious though. I look forward to trying more baked goods here"}
{"text":"Worst brunch experience in a very long time. We came here on Sunday morning hoping for some fast breakfast and coffee . The menu is posted on a chalk board which is cool and we ordered quickly from our server whom seemed busy and uninterested although I think she was the only person on the floor. We waited a long time for our drinks and nearly 50 mins for our food which was bloody a disgrace. I had the club sandwich with salad and hash. The bread was stale and the hash was not cooked and cold in the Centre. My boyfriend had the eggs Benny which consisted of a 13 dollar egg and some undercooked potato. Upon finishing our meal we were greeting with the bill before our table had been cleared. I probably wouldn't have wrote this review if our waitress had asked how our meal was, how do u give feedback if your not asked. Do ur self a favourite and go to cafe neon down the street."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for brunch or lunch. The service is great and the food is excellent. There are many great vegan and non-vegan options to choose from."}
{"text":"I arrived right when they opened and they needed a few more minutes to prepare themselves. My party was late thankfully but it took us about 30 minutes for our order to be taken and there was more staff than guests. Unfortunately when they did bring us our meals two of them had the wrong type of eggs. I had water which was nice and chilled in a funky bottle. My friends had coffee which they said was terrible; I tasted it so I can confirm this. I loved loved the bread they served with the traditional egg breakfast and was pretty fond of the hash brown.
Our waitress never seemed to recover from being surprised at her first customer (me) and at how busy they were by the end of our visit. Food was exactly what I hoped for but the attitude and slowness of the server was off-putting. I'd go back but wouldn't wait in line."}
{"text":"My friend and I came across this store as we were walking for about an hour and wanted to go some where to warm up. As soon as we walked in, the warmth hit us. It was nice. Our server was pleasant. 

She had a friendly smile and a kind disposition. My friend ordered the Earl Grey and I ordered the Mint Green tea. It was really good and it came in this huge teapot that probably equals an extra large and a bit, a large and a medium, or three medium cups to take away (if you are lucky) and at $2.50, that is decent... probably better than decent actually.

I also ordered a bowl of lentil vegetable soup. My friend and I both thought it looked like Amy's veggie lentil and it was $6, which was expensive, considering I could get the can for less at a grocery store, but I am the one who suggested it to our server. A cup was too small and I didn't want to pay $8.50 for a salad and a biscuit too... so I settled for the 6 bucks. 

They close at 3pm on Saturday. My guess is that they are predominately a brunch joint. I don't frequent the area enough to know. 

I'd go back for the tea alone. Eating breakfast, or any meal for that matter tends to be so expensive when you choose to eat in an-outside-the-home-establishment. Sure, you pay for the experience and the niceity of not eating at home, yet the price is often so expensive and usually you can get a meal for cheaper in the comfort of your own home. 

To anyone reading this I would recommend trying an egg dish. As opposed to something they're not really known for."}
{"text":"The Sunflower chickpea scramble was the perfect way to start my morning and their smoothies are also awesome. Vegan breakfasts can be a bit tricky when you can't eat a ton of tofu, but this breakfast was excellent. I definitely left satisfied and would 100% go back...if I lived in Toronto :)  Love the neighborhood cafe vibe. Service was perfect. Almond milk for my coffee was a huge win."}
{"text":"Really tasty and well though out brunch. Small and cramped (quirky?) space. Good coffee. Have been here twice and both times the food was great. The wait is a bit long for food and if you're in a party of 2 expect to be sitting very close to the next table. Lots of vegetarian and meat dishes alike. Food brisket!!"}
{"text":"If you want a typical egg Benedict, this is not the place for it unfortunately.  Their version of Benny consisted of butternut squash, roasted garlic, caramelized onions, cornmeal tart, poached eggs, and dilly chèvre crema.  No meat, no Hollandaise sauce, no English muffin.  Portion was small for how much they charged.  The \"Benny\" tasted a little bland, cornmeal tart was tough.  The Pear Ginger Juice and the complimentary bite-size Banana Bread Muffins were decent though.  Service could be slow here if you have a big group."}
{"text":"We came in a big group, and there was a fairly long wait but it was definitely worth it! They seem to have a fairly small staff, and when we came in they were very busy. 


All brunch options looked beautiful and tasted even better. They put a lot of time into their food so be patient with them!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this place for quite some time, and this past Sunday, I finally did!

We got in around 12:30pm and were expecting a wait (which ended up being about 30 mins long) but we got some coffees to tide us over while we waiting.  My almond milk latte was perfectly made and served in a stemless cup, complete with saucer!  

While waiting, I took in the décor - it's both functional and homey.  I love that they serve tea in ceramic teapots and can brew a pot for 2 to share.  They have some baked goods on display - the apple ring looked really inviting and I had planned to have some as dessert (but ended up being too full to indulge).

We were seated by the window, basking in the sun, which I enjoyed thoroughly.  There are no menus at the table - you look at the large chalkboard to see the menu of the day.  My buddy and I decided to order the breakfast poutine and sweet potato and black bean quesadilla.

It was a sunny Sunday, so we sat there in the sun, waiting for our meals but sadly, the wait turned too long - it was almost 50 minutes before our food arrived (hence the 4 star rating) but  we weren't disappointed when it did.  

My quesadilla was perfect sized - not so big that I couldn't finish it but not too small to have me wanting for more.  It had two sunny side up eggs atop it, which made for a lovely mix of textures and flavours.  I think I had devoured more than half of my plate within minutes!  The house slaw, fresh avocado and the homemade ketchup and hot sauce added lovely depth to the home fries that accompanied the quesadilla.  All in all, lovely meal!

My buddy's breakfast poutine came with bits of chopped up sausage.  The poutine is made of home fries rather than French fries, and tasted pretty good, although I am partial to the texture and length of French fries for my poutine.  His dish came with corn bread (with real corn kernels) - it was perfect! The right balance of texture and sweetness...I think I could have eaten an entire loaf of the stuff!

Service (other than the slow arrival of our meal) is great - I really enjoyed interacting with their attentive staff.  I'm definitely going back, particularly since I've heard that they tend to switch up their menu quite often."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place for breakfast. Everything screamed hipster to me and a lot of brunch joints around this area has been quite good. I got the 2 eggs and sausage as the veggie plates didn't sound too great to me. The sausage was dry, barely warm when I got them and there was more fruit and coleslaw than the rest of my plate.  The toast was good though.  I liked how they made the sauces in house but at the same time they forgot traditional condiments like strawberry jam and their ketchup wasn't strong enough.  Pricing was also a little too high for brunch.  I had to try it myself but I have heard beforehand that costing was going to be a bit higher."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were good. The service left something to be desired. 

We showed up and all the tables were full but we would be first in line. 

Server: it'll be about twenty minutes. 
Me: cool, no problem, can I leave my name or..? 
Server: sure, but if you go away, we can't hold your spot. 
Me:umm... Doesn't that make leaving my name irrelevant? 
Server: no, not at all. 

Whatever, ok, walked round the corner to the amazing Wallace Espresso, grabbed a coffee. We sat outside hello darling. We had to check with them if our table was available, it was. They prevented us from sitting down so they could wipe the table down. We waited 5 minutes, finally just sat down and then they were upset they had to clean around us? Table wasn't even dirty ....

Anyway, good music, atmosphere was nice, food was fresh and tasty. 

I like the idea of a chalkboard menu but not when there's only one, on one wall, and no one tells me... Let me know stuff! You're a new place in the hood! Expect newcomers often. 

I'll be back, once, to see if service improves."}
