{"text":"Catfish, jumbo shrimp and fries all great. Whatever seasoning they use on the seafood is addictive!"}
{"text":"Was not as good as other post suggest.  For the cost to quality ratio should have gone someplace else."}
{"text":"Was really pleasantly surprised.  Been craving long John silvers and decided to give this place a try and I must say it was very good and a good price.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and the fried okra. They are on. It's grub hub and order up which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate here once before a couple years ago and fried catfish dinner, fried okra, and hush puppies were  5 star great food.  Decided to do it again today and there must have been an owner change or something, because the prices had been jacked way up, the fried okra was tough, the hush puppies were burnt - hard enough to play hand ball with, the three piece catfish dinner however might have been good if not for the 5 pounds of seasoning (salt), or MSG (SALT), or secret white stuff (salt) they 'poured' on everything.  We paid $34 for salt with crappy food underneath it; also they have a sign telling you to keep your receipt but they never gave us one, and naturally we didn't think about it till we got home 15 miles away and discovered the salty crud they called food.   Pros - their parking lot is a good place to check your text messages and clip your finger nails. Cons - their food is way too salty and tends to be burnt, and is WAY overpriced for the low quality.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND ...... I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN MYSELF !"}
{"text":"This place sucks they are rude , and only takes cash , food is ok but the service and professionalism is crap , and also it says they close at 11 and they actually closes at 10 be careful they will hang up in you're face if you call at that time do not recommend this location"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to seafood and love fried shrimp.   You have to be willing to try it out. Pack some heat when going to this location. And lock your car. Bring cash as they don't take credit cards. But they have an ATM in the store.   I get the jumbo fried shrimp. You can get 7 or 14. 7 was around $22 dollars but well worth it. I counted and he gave me 10. It's served with their fries and two slices of white bread.   You can have them put seasoning on them too. I always get it and love it.   When your there don't look at its building. Cause it's not the most clean but it all goes into the fryer. Let just hope the change the oil on a regular basis.   I also got the hush puppies and love them.   It amazes me how expensive it is here and that the crowed it serves can afford these prices. But more power to them."}
{"text":"...I walk like 20mn on the snow and surprise! They Only accept cash .....in 2016   ....wow!"}
{"text":"The food is always hot and delicious. The delivery is quick. I'm never disappointed. I usually get the wings with extra seasoning and hush puppies. Huge portions. They don't speak English too well but who cares. Every person there has been nothing but helpful and polite."}
{"text":"WORSE SERVICE/FOOD EVER DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY... They double fried old chicken (40 piece wing order) and sent me home to my family with that garbage hard inedible chicken I don't live on the north side so when I got home it was late I called the next day and the guy V or Z (he refused to clarify his name) called me ignorant and hung up on me NEVER AGAIN!!! Don't waste your time, energy, or sanity dealing with this business especially if you're a stickler for edible food and good customer service"}
{"text":"\"Not even freshly squeezed\", LEMONADE $2.99 for an average sized cup is a bit much and 80 cents for every refill is ridiculous !!  Chicken wings Amazing , no sauces necessary !! Cole slaw is sweet & tasty , corn nuggets & Catfish  delish...  Building certainly needs some TLC and a deep cleaning so that's why I can only give them 3 stars...  The help was polite, patient and courteous"}
{"text":"I place an order online received a confirmation number, I get there to p/u my order and they tell me since they are not delivering today that they are not taking online orders... I was very upset about this, I don't care if ur \"not delivering\" today it has nothing to to with me placing a pick up order!!"}
{"text":"Since I am visiting Pittsburgh I was on Yelp trying to find a good place to eat.  Saw the review for here and we decided to try it... Well if you've never been do not be fooled by the bldg and logo being so huge.. IT IS NOT A SIT PLACE TO EAT!  After we pay for parking we walked in to only realize it was a takeout spot.  We were lil disappointed, and almost left,  but we decided to order anyway and take the food back to hotel.  I'm must say the food was delish.  We ordered the Fitch and wings combo with and order of fried orka. The fish and chicken and fries were great.. The fried okra on other hand was not.  It was too breaded and since I'm from the south I'm picky about certain 'southern ' foods. And make sure when you get your food you have all the condiments you asked for b/c we were missing some. And ask for enough of them or you will run out. So I gave it a 3 for bad okra and forgetting some of the condiments I asked for, other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Good shrimp and wings!   Hook has been in Pittsburgh since 2005. This Hook location is on Frankstown Road in Penn Hills across from Rey Azteca. It is pretty much a take out location by they do have a few tables to eat your food there if you prefer.   As far as seafood they offer catfish fillets, nuggets, cod, perch, regular and jumbo shrimp, oysters, scallops, tilapia and whiting. Dinners come in small, large and family sizes. All dinners come with cole slaw, fries and bread.   As far as chicken dinners they offer gizzards, nuggets, tenders and wings and they are also available in small and large sizes. Wing dinners are available anywhere from 3 wings to 150 wings.   They also offer chicken and fish combos including:   catfish & wings, perch & wings, catfish cut & chicken tenders and perch & chicken tenders.

The wings are very good also, they're just on the small side. I like my wings big like at Honeybee's in Homewood."}

{"text":"It use to be decent when they first opened, like most places they start to fall off. The wings where awful, taste like they been sitting in old chicken grease and the prices went up, I give them two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious chicken fried perfectly. The only downside is this place is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM inside in case you dont have cash (i never do) the food is basically made to order unless you call ahead your order will most likely be done before you get there. I wait inside and then walk home and its still warm and delcious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always loved Hooks. But recently after ordering the 10piece wing meal my boyfriend fell ill. (I did not eat and am perfectly fine) I have never seen him that sick before. He cannot keep nothing down. Being in the food industry myself I would look into your storing temps to ensure all poultry and fish are stored at proper temperatures and make sure you are not handing out bad product. This is the only thing he ate that day and now is sick as a dog. As much as we loved hookfish we will not return due to the possibility of getting sick again."}
{"text":"Generic, cheap garbage. Great idea for a business. Drop frozen ingredients in a deep fryer and go to town. Awful wings. No sauce, nothing seasoned. Coated in salt. Soggy, unseasoned fries. Also coated in salt. Watery, store-bought cole slaw. No flavor at all. Sensing a pattern here?   First meal of 2017!   Order a pizza."}
{"text":"Not cheap but good quality ... they have numerous locations throughout the city... Most are real good and I actually prefer the fish over the chicken but both are good"}
{"text":"So I have been craving Peach cobbler for a few months now.  I was told that this restaurant sold some.  So I finally got a chance to go. I came home,  warmed it up and was excited.  Then I took my first bite and it was mediocre.  I'm still craving Peach cobbler.  I may just have to use someone's oven!"}
{"text":"My family has ordered several times and had no problems until today.  The delivery time varies depending on how busy they are.  Today, the delivery only took 20 minutes.  I have worked in food service and I understand that in the course of preparation there is a chance that hair may get into the food.  However, it's another thing to find several hairs.  I picked one out of the coleslaw and decided not to eat it.  When I went to eat a shrimp, the hair was embedded into the batter because I couldn't even pull it off.    I called the store and I explained to the gentleman that answered that I would like them to pick up their food and issue a refund because I found hair.  His response:  \"what kind of hair because we don't have women working in the store?\" I told him that was irrelevant.  He told me that they would not come and pick up the food and hung up.  I called back and said, you hung up on me... I would like a refund.  He asked me to hold and again hung up!    I live five minutes away and showed up at their counter in ten.  The guy answering the phone was at the counter.  When he said hello, I recognized his voice.  I said hey, I'm the lady you hung up on twice... where's your manager?  He tells me there is no manager.  I ask for the person in charge of everyone working.  An older gentleman comes up and I explain the situation.  To save you from reading a novel, he issued me a refund of $20 but my order was $25.44.  I show him the receipt on my phone, he again compares it to his store receipt and gives me the difference.   I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"I can't resist. This place is SO good. It is not an eat-in establishment. Calling ahead is a great idea. Basic choices; amazing taste. Tons of calories-every one worth it. We get the chicken planks all the time. The fries are great. There is so much grease, they put white bread in the container. The meals also come with cole slaw.  When you are ready to forego the diet and eat amazing fried chicken; look no further!!"}
{"text":"\"Fry that fish!\"   I'll admit it here I cannot fry fish nor  chicken and oh what a shame it is because I love me some fried chicken.  I went to Hooks Fish and Chicken with only 15 minutes to spare before my bus came, I was in and out and the service was prompt and friendly. I even shared a laugh with the cashier.   I ordered a whiting dinner with three wings. My food was prepared while I waited.  The fish and chicken was seasoned so well just the right amount of garlic which for me means tons of garlic. My the fish dinner was a hearty serving and was enough to be both a lunch and dinner later that night.   Having fried foods is one of the best ways to turn a day from good to great! Thanks Hooks for the great service and stellar meal."}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of magic unicorn pixie dust they sprinkle on their food, but whatever it is, I can't get enough!  After years of hearing a friend ask me if I've tried Hook Fish and Chicken yet, I could finally answer yes.  And then I finally understood why she kept asking.  I tried the combo featuring 6 whole wings, fries, slaw and bread.  It was all just. So. Good.  The bread (your basic white sliced) is placed on the bottom, like a cloud that any grease from the wings can soak in to.  The wings and fries are packed into a styrofoam container and sprinkled with their infamous seasoning and then closed tightly with a rubber band placed around to keep all that goodness from spilling out.    The menu is basic, just pick your fried food of choice (wings, tenders, fish, shrimp) and sides (even fried okra).  My meal was $8.  It is cash only and take out only with an ATM on site.  You can call ahead but most orders are ready in ten minutes.    Be warned, you will become an addict.  \"Why did I only get 6 wings?\" I kept asking myself as I have been dreaming of those wings ever since."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Love the chicken! It can be addictive....But, must watch the calories. It is definitely a treat. Order before you go as it is fairly greasy and you could leave smelling like a chicken plank."}
{"text":"I had a craving today for fried chicken.  I decided to check out Hook since it's just around the corner.  I decided on the wing and fries combo with a side of hot sauce.  Man - whatever they sprinkle on that chicken is the bomb!  I didn't need the hot sauce because the dust was so tasty!  The fries were okay and the side of slaw was good, but the chicken was amazing.  For $8 - you get 6 wings and side of fries and slaw (with 2 slice of bread?  Like what is that for??  Grease trap?). I will definitely be back when I crave fried chicken."}
{"text":"The best food joint in mt oliver. Thats not saying much, but i really enjoyed the chicken tenders, fries, and cole slaw"}
{"text":"The worst customer service EVER!! Placed an order on Grubhub, when the order was late I called to find out when it I could expect delivery. The man informed me that they weren't delivering tonight. The restaurant NEVER called to say that they weren't doing delivery. Then he hangs up on me and when I call back, he wants to argue with me. I was a huge fan of their food. Not anymore!  They will NEVER get my business EVER again after that treatment. Besides, I can get better fish and chicken elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"The best seafood place in town besides red lobster..... I don't know what the season their fish in but whatever it is should be illegal cause it calls my name in my sleeo"}
{"text":"I ordered 20 wings, fish sandwich dinner, hushpuppies, and fried oysters.  Order came quick but driver called from his car and I had to go to the car instead of him coming to my door. Every item was covered in a seasoning salt that was not described on menu,  terrible. Every fried item except fish was over cooked and hard. Also very tiny portions. Wings were also very small. Fish was only item cooked properly and was edible. Restaurant was informed but only offered a $10 refund on a 50 dollar bill. Over priced, over cooked, just over. Definitely will not order from again."}
{"text":"Tiny, tiny 3 whole wings with fries and 6 oysters were $10+. Will not go back. Super market wings are better than these. It was my second try here, so I am for sure.  You should get a plain pizza if you want to spend $10."}
{"text":"They have great chicken wings fried in fresh  oil consistently. If you love shrimp then look no further.Their food is made to order and may take a little longer if you're expecting fast food .  When I have a craving for fish or shrimp they are at the top of my list. I don't like  long reviews, I just want to convey places  were I had good food. Bon appétit."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp and chicken tender meal. Their chicken and shrimp are seasoned just right. Whenever I get a taste for fried food we always frequent this company. There chicken wings are delicious too."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders in this place is just amazing!!! Never disappoints. Perfect crunch yet perfectly cooked!! I also loved the fried zucchini and cheese sticks!! Finally great customer service super friendly people!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 30 wings along with fries and catfish nuggets, all I can say is Bravo. No issues taking the order over the phone with cc. I will be visiting more going forward."}
{"text":"I love getting food from this place, it's always so good. Tonight i was so disappointed in this place. I called twice around 10 pm, no answer i was thinking maybe the number on the website wasn't updated because there was no voicemail it just kept ringing. So at 1015 i drove over there from PENN HILLS about a 20-25 min drive only to find out someone closed 45 mins early. I even took a picture of the times on the door that states they are open till 11pm. I'm very upset that they have business hours but don't even follow them. There wasn't a sign saying someone had to leave due to emergency or anything like that. They simply locked the doors and didn't answer phone calls after 10. If that is the case change your damn hours because it's very rude to lead people to think you're open."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I am giving hook 4 stars is because the wings are that good! The restaurant is EXTREMELY gross looking! The only reason why I went there is because of the wings. I stop going because it got to the point where I had force myself not to look at the floor because I was scared I was going to see a \"pest\" run around. The people working there are just like the restaurant... disgusting! The last time I went there the guy trying (I said trying because I walked out immediately) to take my order was cleaning his nails with a paper clip. ... I'm getting sick just thinking about it.   They have the best wings I have ever tasted but its not worth it if you are worried a roach might end up in your food."}
{"text":"2 words..... CRACK CHICKEN!!! Ok so let start with obvious, this is not a sit down and enjoy your meal kind of place. Its a hole in the wall chicken and fish place, and in that regard its a very good one. As for what you should get from this place......... fish and chicken. Nothing else just stick to the fish and chicken.   To the first reviewer, gizzards??? Well at least you learned your lesson lol. As for everyone else, if your going to visit this place please remember its a fish and chicken spot. Meaning fish sandwiches and wings are what they do best."}
{"text":"After turning left onto Frankstown Road so many times, and seeing this place to the right of me.. Eh, why not, I'm new to Pittsburgh and I never heard of this chain before.  I enjoy a good piece of fried fish and this place does it justice. I ordered 6 wings & fries, 1 piece of Catfish and one piece of whiting. I asked was the fish fresh or frozen..frozen. Right then and there I had my doubts. But I was wrong!  Less then 5 minutes after I walked out the door, I was home. I broke open my package of food. Everything STILL hot and crispy. Fries were out of this world, fish too. What is this sprinkling or dusting of spices on the chicken I asked myself. I even rubbed it with my finger, then tasted. I was told its their special seasoning that they put on. Not bad, not overpowering. I didn't need to add any salt. Both pieces of fish broke apart as I tore into them. The crusty batter stayed in its place on both halves..remarkable. The insides looked like teeth smiling back at me daring me to taste their hot insides...if I must. Before I knew it, everything was gone. I didn't feel heavy, and I didn't want anything else more to eat.  This food is so good that if you were drunk, it would sober you right on up. Can't wait until I pay them another visit...soon."}
{"text":"I've experienced better from them indeed. When I first moved to Pittsburgh in May 2009, I used to come here often. The wings were huge and juicy. Then the place caught fire. After the renovation, their wings shrank in size. Instead of big juicy wings, now you get tiny overfried wings. Some of the wings are literally half the size it used to be. Price of course remains the same. Too bad though they used to have the best wings in Pittsburgh.  As for cleanliness, not too concerned about it. Why? Everything is FRIED on the spot only when you order so it kills all germs! hah!. Minimal handling as it goes into styrofoam box once out of the fryer.  By the way, its CASH only."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim and I wish I had not.  I ordered a cod fish-  I was impressed at first because they breaded the fish to order and it looked good.  The oil was very heavy, the bun was stale and even the fries were not worth the swallow bad. The staff sprinkle a mysterious magic white power on everything.  It looks like a cross between dandruff and the white fake cheese power on popcorn.  Even the generic hot sauce was flavorless and to top it all off I decided to try gizzards at the suggestion of the friendly owner.  I choked a couple down only to have them come right back up.  I have an iron stomach and Hook Fish grease. powder and parts brought me to my knees.  Bring your pepto and skip the gizzards."}
{"text":"Got into Pittsburgh late. My father recommended Dominos Pizza. I told him to stop by this spot.  Thank god I did. They not great on personality. The  chicken wings was well seasoned and fried to perfection."}
{"text":"Wanted to take a pic but we ate the food too fast. This southern gal has found a great place to get a catfish fix. Thank you!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with hooks ! The chicken is great and so are the catfish bites . Extra \"dust\" please!    The workers are very rude if you don't know exactly what you want. They are not very patient. Also it seems like They do not like answering questions. This place is CASH ONLY. So come prepared. Overall it's a really good place cuz the food is delish!"}
{"text":"Had the fried gizzards. Everything is fried to order while you wait. Friendly staff and tasty food. Limited seating for waiting and not eating, so really just a takeout or eat in your car place."}
{"text":"Really good! I ordered the Tilapia and Fries...and got a whole lot with big huge fish filets. I've also had their fried chicken in the past and that was good as well. I just wish they accepted cards. Yes they do have an ATM but that charges you. It is definitely a great place to check out, but make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"I always get the Catfish and Chicken Dinner w/ a side of Fried Scallops. I don't know what seasoning this place uses but it's incredible. The catfish breading is right on the level of some of the top restaurants I've been to in the South."}
{"text":"As long as you don't expect service with a smile, then this will be a good spot for you!  I sampled the fried chicken wings, fried scallops, fried whiting filet, fried jumbo shrimps, and French fries. As I review this, I realize how calorically wrong this plate sounds but if you are going to indulge in seafood, this is where you want to be.   And everything for me was a sample because the portions were so large that I wasn't able to finish any one thing. It made for great leftovers the next day, though.  They sprinkle some dust on the fried seafood after it comes out the fryer but I wouldn't be able to tell you what it is. It looks like sawdust but has no taste and the \"friendly\" cashier ignored me when I asked him what he was sprinkling on my food.   Even with his attitude, I still give this a 4 star experience. That says a lot...  There is a take out only restaurant so unless you live in the area, be prepared to eat in your car...like I did."}
{"text":"Yes the pricing is weird. Yes there is no seating. Yes they only except cash. I'll just stick to reviewing the food. The \"powder\" is a nice touch. It's delicious. Fries are great! I ordered the perch and it was amazing as well. Considering there is no dine in, the food is packaged well and holds up (mine didn't get soggy at all) while I took it back home. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Hook Fish & Chicken is a local chain of soul food restaurants that has made its way into the South Hills of Pittsburgh within the past year. The majority of these fried food purveyors can be found in the North Side or East of the city. This location was once a KFC many years ago and offers much of the same grub is larger predecessor did. While running errands with my mother and sister, we chanced upon it and decided to take a plunge...into the world of hot fat delight.   Watching the french fries come out of a frozen bag as we awaited our takeout order was disappointing, but not a deal-buster, yet anyway.   I'm not sure about the other HF&C franchises, but this one only offers poultry mostly in \"nugget\" and \"tender\" wing form instead of the standard leg/thigh/breast configurations, which is probably why I chose something I had no business ordering: Chicken Gizzards.   Never before do I recall ever seeing them on an area menu before, so it came as a shock to me, and being adventurous, I just had to dig in.   Ehhh, they were like eating pieces of tire dredged in Quikrete. My jaws were sore, and my mouth had sores in it for days due to the hardened, cornmeal breading. Someone in a review of another HF&C eatery wrote of a \"magical unicorn pixie dust seasoning\" that supposedly \"made\" all of their menu items sing. All it did was make my piehole sting due to the aforementioned lesions (swishing with salt water helped). The gizzards alone were an ordeal.  As its name states, HF&C one-ups KFC by also offering seafood. A number of varieties of fish can be had: catfish, perch, whiting, and cod. Additionally, HF&C sells fried oysters (!), crabcakes, scallops, shrimp. Furthermore, there are deep-fried sides such as zucchini, mushrooms, cheese sticks, jalapenos, hush puppies, and okra (!!) on tap. Regular readers can probably already assume that I had some oysters and crabcakes.   The oysters saved the day somewhat, that maize-derived jacket steaming some juicy love into those fat little buggers. The cole slaw was very good as well, recalling that which KFC themselves still does a surprisingly damn fine job of with its milky dressing and cold crunchy veggies (kohlrabi?). In fact, it tasted almost exactly like KFC's slaw, and that is not a bad thing. Not at all.   The crabcake, however, was a dismal puck of imitation crabmeat. Those red streaks do not lie. There was plenty of crab in each cookie, but damn it, people will pay more for real crabmeat, even if it's claw meat or special and not jumbo lump. As I've stated before in reviews of crappy crabcakes, my mom's beat 'em all. She awaits an email from yinz for her most excellent recipe.   Dessert's on the bill of fare too. Cheesecake, carrot cake, red velvet cake, banana pudding, pumpkin pie and even peach cobbler are there for the taking, but for me, it was the simple pleasure of a fudgy chocolate cake that recalled the grandest of lunchtime treats with its flap of deadly frosting and moist body.   Note to the proprietors: Ditch the gizzards. Start selling some drumsticks 'n thighs. Use some real crustaceans in those deviled cakes. Cut your own fries. Business will pick up. Until then, I'll be forgiving and grant y'all a 3. I want this place to do brisk commerce. It would do the neighborhood some good."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing! Whole wings not little wing dings that you get at the bar. Take them home and watch a movie or they do orders of 100+ if you're having a party. I order from here all the time and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken around and barley any wait time for it too... The staff is friendly and nice.. I recommend this places over any chicken place..."}
{"text":"We typically go to the Fifth Avenue location in Wilkinsburg but tried Frankstown Road because Penn Hills is a bit easier for us to get to from Oakmont. Both locations leave much to be desired from their location and what the shop looks like - but it's definitely worth a visit. I will say that the wings seemed a bit smaller than the 5th Ave. location; however, the taste is the same one that we love. Hook Fish & Chicken has THE BEST dry rub seasoning in Pittsburgh. We always buy an extra tub and keep it in our own spice shaker at home for leftovers. We typically only get wings and sometimes fries - so I can't speak to anything else on the menu - but if I had to choose from anywhere in Pittsburgh, HFC is our favorite wings!"}
{"text":"How in the WORLD have I missed this place?! I'm from the south and I feel like I know good catfish. The catfish was excellent the chicken was excellent the hush puppies were excellent and the seasoning was amazing! On top of all this the people that work there were extremely friendly as it was my first visit. The Northside location is not sit down though. I was only able to finish half my meal so they give you a lot. You can also tell them how much spice you want them to shake on your order before they give it to you. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Get their wings. It's the whole wing with two parts and fried to perfection in clean oil. The catfish is fluffy and breaded with cornmeal like they do in the south (aw yay-uh) and it's not too salty. They give you plenty of tartar sauce and ketchup as well. It's an amazing addition to the East Liberty/Homewood Junction.  I am a huge wings person and this IS the place to go for wings. It's simple ingredients but there's something about the seasoning that makes me go back again and again.  Some seating would be nice, there's not a lot of places in the area to rest in, and you want to eat it hot. I ended up eating my styrofoam container of goodness at the nearby baseball park watching a little leagues game."}
{"text":"They delivered my food on time. Everything was still hot. The delivery man did not speak any English though so I had to figure out the total cost myself. Everything looks really good. The crab cakes could have been better, there's a lot of breading on them. The wings could've been seasoned a little more. The fries are perfect. I may give this place a 2nd try & order something else."}
{"text":"This place is convenient and open late! It's mostly fried foods with lots of salt so definitely now what you want to eat every day, but I love it. The mozzarella sticks are really good and they come with French fries..."}
{"text":"6 wings meal, good seasoning. (Only plus about this meal)  also good French fries. The kids chicken nuggets came from a frozen Tyson bag. Smells & tastes jus like Tysons frozen, that they threw in some oil. Cheap ass.& add Nickel's white bread..coulda least got bread from breadworks beings it's right down street."}
{"text":"The restaurants listed close time is to 10pm...i go in to order my food around 9:20pm. The person running the cashier tells me the store is closed even though there is still 40 minutes left until the listed closed time. The man continued to give me a hard time and finally gave in to put in my order after arguing for about 5 minutes. Food was mediocre compared to other times i've had. Also witnessed them continuously not serve and be rude to other customers who had come shortly after me. something needs to change."}
{"text":"Good place for fried fish. Carry out only with a number of options from which to choose. I would've liked a little more seasoning on my whiting, but nothing some hot sauce couldn't fix. Also, very good french fries."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Hook's for the first time in about two years tonight. We originally tried to order two orders of the 10 piece wings with fries, coleslaw, and bread. The one guy working said that we were only able to get wings. So while he was saying that there were \"just wings,\" another gentleman came in and was told the same thing so he turned around and walked out. We ordered 20 wings and sat down to wait. After receiving our wings, I asked another worker if we were unable to get bread, coleslaw, and fries since it was 10:15 and they closed at 11. This guy told us we were able to order them all along so we (of course) ordered them as well. When we got home and opened the box, we only received the fries, not the bread nor the coleslaw. We sure paid for them though.  Please note that the prices listed online are NOT the same as the menu at the location, NOR will you pay what is listed on the menu. Expect to pay 3-4 dollars more than what is shown. Why? I still have no idea. Our food was okay. We ate about 5 each and 1/3 the fries. We asked for them to be \"extra crispy/fried hard\" and two of the three men had no idea what that meant. The wings were gummy and the fries were soggy. It was definitely a disappointment."}
