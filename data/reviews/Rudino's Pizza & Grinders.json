{"text":"The most delicious thing are the spicy wings and the creamy chicken pasta the pizza is good the people working are nice and help you when you dont know what to order"}
{"text":"I had a 18inch steak grinder and was very impressed with the amount of meat they put on their grinders. As a truck driver I eat a lot of mom and pop restaurants and this one would be in my top 5."}
{"text":"I tried Rudino's  today with a take out order for my wife and I. She had the Italian Grinder and I had the French dip grinder. We both said they were absolutely great and had very fresh ingredients. We will try their pizza next and will do the grinder thing again. Great grinders."}
{"text":"I had a pizza and it really wasn't bad.  The crust was unique, though not the best I've ever had.  I had no complaints about the quality of the toppings.  In general, one of the better pizzas I've had in Charlotte.  It's a pretty big, nice looking restaurant in a pretty neat area.  Parking, no problem.  Especially because the restaurant was totally empty when I showed up on a Sunday night.  Seriously, no one there.  I'm still not precisely sure where the staff (I doubt there were more than three) were parked.  Not that I care how many people are eating there when I'm the patron, and especially not when I'm getting take out, but I do have to wonder: can this place survive?  This brings me to my final point: This review may have been a little more positive if not for the completely bizarre hours Rudino's is open.  Friday and Saturday until 10 PM is kind of early for a pizza place, but I acknowledge that Charlotte sucks.  Sunday until 8 PM, that's a bit restrictive for a restaurant.  But the really funny part?  Monday through Thursday until... 4 PM.  4 PM.  For a restaurant.  A pizza restaurant.  Why not 3 PM?  Or 2 PM?  Is the lunch crowd really coming in at 4 PM still?  Way too early for dinner, too late for lunch.  What the hell?  Charlotte sucks, but does it really suck \"close at 4 PM\" badly?  I'd love to give Rudino's a second try for dinner, but with hours like that, when will I have the chance?"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch.  The pizza (like most pizza joints in the QC) is ok, but their sandwiches are top notch and enormous.  The all you can eat pizza buffet is a nice touch for lunch but a little pricey.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Ya just can't beat a 50% off deal! While the appeal of free food brought us in the door, it did get these guys on our radar. Up until recently, we had no idea they were right around the corner given their prime real estate (sarcasm).   I generally liked as many things as I disliked here. The owners and staff are very friendly, but the location and the interior are pretty lack luster. The parking lot can be a real pain to maneuver through if it's crowded, or if Old Statesville has a good bit of traffic- which it usually does. Interior is a bit tight.  The food is another 50/50. The grinders are good. Pizza? Meh, definitely had better.   My top negative would be pricing. This definitely isn't your top notch \"NY style\" and you pay $$$ for it. Comparing the pizza quality, I'd say it resembles a CiCi's. Comparing the pizza pricing, I'd say a large, true NY style (just up the road, given) is the same price as a small \"NY style\" here.  So again, you can expect pretty great customer service and real decent grinders here (and maybe other menu items too). Haven't tried their buffet either, so that might be cool.   Personally, it's just hard to justify their pricing. Will be looking out for the coupons!"}
{"text":"The owners are great, very nice and welcoming. The personal pizza tastes and is priced amazing! We eat a lot of pizza and this is our favorite place. Their grinders are also incredible I've had a few and loved them all. The bad reviews are several years old I believe it's come under new management since then."}
{"text":"Call it a Grinder or a Sub or a Hero or a Hogie, it's still a good sandwich.  Decided to try Rudino's over the Christmas holidays but they took an extended break but we did manage to make it by today.  It's is a tiny strip mall that butts right up to Old Statesville Rd so traffic is tight. Once you get inside, it rather spartan but I did observe that most of their business is either carry out or delivery.  Primary items served are Grinders (Subs) made with fresh baked bread and cuts of meat. Most shops have 6\" and 12\" as their standard size but Rudino's standard sizes are 9\" and 18\". They don't skimp on the fillings either.  My wife had the Angus Grinder and it was quite impressive. She enjoyed it and her only comment wa that she wished they had put the veggies on the sandwich prior to putting it in the oven as opposed to putting raw veggies on at the end.  I had a 9\" Meatball Grinder that was very good but unfortunately did not have a bold robust flavor that jumped out. The Marinara could have had a bit more zest to it and it would have been perfect.  Staff is very nice and efficient. When we placed our order, they had it back to us in just a few minutes. Both sandwiches were still hot out of the oven and I do mean hot.  Good place and I will be back."}
{"text":"I have to knock a star off my previous review after my latest visit.  We went during the typical lunch hour of 12:00-1:00, and the place just did not have it together.  I ordered a salad, paid for it, and then was told they were out of lettuce.  I then switched to the pizza buffet.  There was one pizza out for the entire restaurant, and we were told it would be fifteen minutes before more were provided.  It just seems odd that a restaurant that caters primarily to people on their lunch breaks would be so unprepared for lunch."}
{"text":"Rudino's is similar to a fast food restaurant, except that you order at the register and they bring the food to your table. Average price is $6-$8 for a grinder of calzone. The girl who took our order was incredibly friendly. Our food was brought within 8 minutes and I was impressed with the taste of my Turkey Reuben Grinder. The calzones were also quite tasty, and massive. Good place for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"The food is not good at all.  I had a groupon for a family dinner.  I chose the creamy chicken.  Horrible- my son and his friends wouldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Will never order from here again! Their medium pizza is the size of a Dijorno but w thin crust! Totally overpriced and not worth the money! I'm from NY, and we eat real pizza w real sized slices!!!  The website pics are a farce. Went there only bc it was recommended by a friend. Won't listen to her ever again!"}
{"text":"Went back and tried again.  MISTAKE.  What they call a buffet is a joke.  Two half eaten pizzas and about 3 pieces of garlic bread.  The pizza was hot and very cheesey which s good, but otherwise nothing worth mentioning.  Also, for an all you can eat buffet, you're going to draw eat in customers.  Very little seating in there.  But the place is very small and I don't know how they would fit any more tables in there.  Kind of a mismatch of menu and space really.    Plenty of better lunch spots in the area.  I won't be back.  Go two doors down to Bobee O's and have some BBQ.  BTW-The photo shown with this listing is not from this location."}
