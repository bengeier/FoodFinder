{"text":"REALLY dry ribs, pulled pork tasted like watered down sauce was added after cooking. 

Mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked 

Slaw was good- just normal slaw 

I honestly could not believe how dry my ribs were.... It was pretty heart breaking as I had been looking forward to going there just for that for sooooo long ! 

Brisket was cooked well ... For most of the pieces I got because again part of it was dry. 

Tip***The sauces are good but they need to leave the ribs in for a longer cooking time seriously tho .... Please do.... Ribs are suppose to fall of the bone not be like jerky .... If I wanted jerky I wouldn't order ribs. 

Customer service was great! Very friendly and helpful. 

This place has a LOT of potential to go so far ... The major loss of stars for me was because when you are a bbq house that advertises ribs like that I expect them to know it is suppose to fall off the bone."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I had the takeout pulled pork sandwiches. They were huge!  Good value for the money. Friendly staff, and food was ready and fresh when we picked it up. Tasted better than some I've tasted @ Ribfests."}
{"text":"I wish I knew it existed sooner. We drive by daily but never came til last week. Their smoked BBQ is actually genuinely smoked, and very good. Decor is nice, service is good although its \" a la fast food\" ordering and then they being you the plate. The staff seems to be all family, and they are happy to serve. I loved the BBQ porch ribs, I may try the beef brusque next time. Certainly worth the 15$ and I will be back soon"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to for a legitimate meal. The pulled pork dinner has yet to disappoint me and my buddies who come here. The service is great and the flavor of the food keeps telling me to order more, even though I'm full!

I feel that the exposure of the restaurant is the only thing that prevents people from lining up outside, since it sits deep in that plaza on Kingston road. 

Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! BBQ doesn't get much better than this on a -20 degree day. We are ordering here again! :) The spicy BBQ sauce has a great bite!"}
{"text":"Wow. Did not expect that, we were just driving around for a quick lunch and came across this gem ! Amazing bbq flavours you would not find in Toronto, if you haven't been it's a must try. Friendly staff and amazing food can't go wrong. Next time you feel like a smoked bbq meal, this is the place !"}
{"text":"Went with my wife to this place for what else,  good BBQ,  the food was good, not great and the atmosphere was tolerable. Considering the options for BBQ style food in this area,  we would go again."}
{"text":"Had the daily special this Sunday - the Canadian burger - mozzarella, 2 types of bacon, hand cut chips, big patty. With fries for just $11. Loved it. Was so big I couldn't get my mouth around it  would love to go back"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was heated in microwave and ribs were pre-made in plastic bag and put on grill to heat up.  Pulled port sandwich was good though, but not real bbq"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my boyfriend and ordered the jr pig platter. It was really good, we enjoyed our time here (:"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork dinner for take out and was quite pleased by the whole experience. First, the quality of food was great in terms of the smokiness of the pork, the homemade fries as my side, the homemade coleslaw, plus the sauce. I felt the price and portion size represented excellent value, plus service was quick and efficient. Looking forward to returning and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!! I didn't expect it to be anything special since the former restaurants on that location weren't good at all. This place tastes amazing!! It's as good as \"the stockyards\" on St Clair W. 
I paid only about $11 for this combo. Very satisfying and tasty. The mac n cheese is made from real cheese. Even the hot sauce is handcrafted, excellent hot sauce.  For $2 more, you can get a small loaf of delicious buttery cornbread :) 
Will be going back often. Very exciting."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get beef brisket done right. Ive been here atleast 20 times and always great service/environment. It's located just off whites Rd exit on 401 highway, usually clear sailing between 11-3 pm which is great for casual lunch. 

The beef brisket here has a great texture. It actually looks like it's been shaved off a larger more succulent fatty piece of beef. The head chef here is extremely passionate and you're in for a treat anytime he's here. Definitely worth a shot for barbeque and meat lovers alike."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time today after not loving it when i visited previously shortly after the opening. I have got to say that today's experience was delicious!!! I asked the lady at the counter what the most popular item on the menu is, she said it was any variation of their brisket. So I ordered the brisket sandwich with the smoky sauce (I had a choice of smoky, sweet or spicy). I'm always hesitant about sauces at restaurants because they are usually either packed on wayyyy to much or too sweet even if they aren't labeled as such. When I received my sandwich though, I could tell there was a great sauce to brisket ratio, and there was a healthy portion of brisket on the bun, not stingy at all. I did not order a side, but the sandwich itself came with a little side order of house slaw (mayonnaise base but not too mayonnaisey, good balance) and a pickle spear.

Only complaint is one of the brisket slices had a huge chunk of fat on it which I don't enjoy, although some might! The sandwich otherwise was downright scrumptious, and under $9 after tax"}
{"text":"Found my new place to go when I'm craving mac n' cheese! Damn this place's was amazing. It was a bit of a wait (maybe 15 mins or so?) for take-out but it was worth it - I'd try calling in next time so it's ready for me when I get there.  

It tasted really good with their hot sauce too, I only wish I put more on it!"}
{"text":"Second time there, but we also bought the big platter for take out once.  Love the place.  The brisket beef is very tasty, and just falls apart.  Fries are very good, and the coke is ice cold.  So much meat, I had to take a doggie bag - well, a styrofoam container. And the cole slaw is edible, unlike most places where it seems to be all vinegar.

The wooden chairs are a bit wobbly.  They should tighten them up a bit.  Sit in the padded arm chairs if you can.

They have a cool line of glass, plastic and china pigs on the counter.  Everybody seems to have a favourite.  

I left my phone there today, and one of the staff brought it out right away, before I drove away.  Very friendly staff.  

Wouldn't mind if they had another sauce to pick from.  Not a problem, but the choice would be good.


Will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Yummy bbq in the city. Delicious Mac and Cheese and the platter for two is a generous portion. The ribs and pulled pork were both stand outs on the platter."}
{"text":"Overall a good spot to go if you're looking for pulled pork, ribs and chicken. Sides are OK. Only wish the had more combos. On average you'll end up spending close to $20."}
{"text":"Great place for southern BBQ meats. Was looking for something meaty after a workout and this was conveniently located just outside the U of t AC gym. Certainly satisfied my meat cravings. 

The service was fast. The portions are big, and the meats come with bold flavours."}
{"text":"Went to check out Pig Out yesterday night with the GF (about 8:15 PM), and while it had some redeeming qualities, it was overall very bland, uninspired BBQ, and pretty poor service. I will be going back in a month or so to try it again and see if it was just a matter of them working out the kinks. Considering that this place has delivery and is open till 3AM on the weekend, I would really like them to work out. 

Our order:

GF: Two BBQ soft tacos (one chicken, one brisket), fries, mac n' cheese.
Me: 4 Rib dinner, baked beans, coleslaw, pickles

The breakdown:

Service: 

Our orders were taken by a woman who appeared to be either the owner or the owner's wife, and she was not friendly, in fact I felt a little awkward while telling her what I wanted. We didn't wait long for our meals, (which is pretty normal for BBQ as most of it is pre-cooked, essentially) but the tacos+sides came out about 5-8 minutes earlier than my ribs (maybe they thought they were apps?). When my ribs did come out, I watched the staff scramble to figure out who's they were, and bring them to two patrons incorrectly before we waved them down ourselves. The pickles were served sliced, still plastic-wrapped and in a pool of BBQ sauce which was incredibly unappetizing and thoughtless. Was told to leave my dishes at the table; the table behind us had not been cleared for 20 minutes. On our way out, the women who took our order, who was closest to the door, made no effort to ask us how our meal was, or to even say goodbye. I realize this is a fast-food joint, but friendliness and courtesy go a long way, and it's bad business to not obtain feedback. 

The Food:

Soft Tacos: the tacos were served a la 'bell\" (lettuce, tomato, cheese) with BBQ sauce on the the meat, pretty uninspired and boring, but the brisket itself was very tasty. The chicken was bland, and the tacos were cool and slightly tough. 

Fries: frozen flat-wedge fries, poorly fried (some crispy, some soft; inconsistent colour), tossed with seasoning salt. Very meh. 

Mac n' Cheese: pretty bland, noodles were too soft (overcooked) and the ramekin it was served in was HALFWAY FULL of butter and/or cheese grease. It was pretty disgusting, we had a couple of bites and left it.  

Ribs: inconsistent; sometimes tasty, but mostly bland. For every bite of fatty, charred goodness, there were two bites of over-sauced, tough-to-chew boredom. I was disappointed but not overly so. 

Baked Beans: bland, but in a weird tangy way that was off-putting. I guess they put brisket in their beans (great idea) because my very first bite was ENTIRELY fat, a whole cube of it (poor execution). We left it after one bite each. 

Coleslaw: delicious. Fresh, crisp n' crunchy, a nice balance between vinegary and creamy, and not overly dressed. Only a small plastic container; by the end of the meal I wish I had more to fill up on. 

Pickles: did not eat based on service. Looked store-bought. 
 
Atmosphere:

Nice, clean place. Walking in, employees were busy cleaning surfaces and cooking. Throughout our meal the woman who took our orders (who I assume is the owner) seemed to stand idly by, with a scowl, staring angrily at her staff. She bothered both of us and I felt that she made the place feel tense and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket sandwich, sweet potato fries and coleslaw!"}
{"text":"Good bbq chicken. However the ribs are a little underseasoned and bland. Not to mention i think they are boiled. The poutine with pulled pork was good :-)"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a few times but just haven't had a chance to check it out. Today was my lucky day. I ordered the pull pork sandwich but also asked about the beef brisket. I was given a generous sample of the beef and loved it! I stuck with the pulled pork however. Sandwich was huge and tasted great. John and Linda (the owners) came by to check on my meal. I felt like I was visiting old friends. 

Update:
I have gone back and had the beef brisket a couple of times and still think this is the best sandwich they have. I'll probably be going back tonight. Can't wait for them to get licensed. I bet the food will taste even better with an ice cold beer."}
{"text":"Go here frequently - food is always top notch!!! Highly recommend it. We've tried almost everything on the menu, and our favourites are the brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, and the fries. Their sauces are awesome also. They often do lunch specials too that we haven't tried but they always look delicious (they post them on their Instagram). You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time but their food safety has gone to shit.  Recently found plastic in my food and the owners response was that it was busy (there was only 6 people in the restaurant at the time). I asked for a refund as I hadn't even touched my food luckily I found the plastic when I was presented my food and he refunded my food, I asked him what about the drink I ordered; his response was that oh didn't you drink it? I pointed to the unopened can of drink that I had returned to the kitchen with my food and he reluctantly gave me a refund on my soda. If they have this attitude to customers finding foreign objects in their food; imagine the other health violations at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations due to its popular reviews but it was a disappointing experience.

When I ordered 2 pounds of chicken wings I asked for separate sauces on each pound specifically requesting for something spicy. Both pounds tasted exactly the same...no flavor at all. 
The pork ribs were mediocre and I could barely finish the fries.

The ambience was actually not bad and the service was prompt and friendly. This would be a great place if the food was improved.

Food : 2/5
Ambience : 3.5/5
Service : 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I love pig out, the food is yummy!! I'm a huge fan of the hamburgers and sweet potato fries. The thing I love the most is that you get pickles with your meal and the pickles are so addicting. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The place is also decorated really cute with all the little piggies. It's a good BBQ joint, people who bad mouth them are just being over critical. I'm picky and trust me the food and service is good!! A+ pig out!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this establishment excellent food especially the beef brisket. Prices for not bad for the amount of food you get. We did the smaller platter for the two of us and ended up bringing some  home"}
{"text":"Went for dinner here last night with my husband and he had the Beef Brisket.  It is the best Beef Brisket in Pickering.  Perfectly moist and crispy edges.  I had the Nacho Fries and that was amazing.  It has beef brisket on it as well as nacho topping.  We had the Pulled Pork sandwiches before here and they were good too."}
{"text":"Ordered  delivery last night...3 BBQ rib dinners with different sides.  It arrived quickly, so no excuse for dried out ribs, stale cornbread (actually hard), soggy fries..both potatoe and sweet potatoe.  Portions were ok, but coleslaw was in a miniscule container.  Perhaps styrofoam containers should be aerated for travel, but generally everything tasted as though it had been prepared way ahead of time.  A complete disappointment based on other reviews...so now back the drawing board."}
{"text":"I went to Pig Out BBQ in Pickering last week to get some take out for dinner.
I waited in line far too long while the cashier finished a conversation with her friend.
I ordered a little bit of everything, pulled pork, ribs, brisket and chicken wings. Fries, mac & cheese, coleslaw and their sauces.
The ribs are dry and flavorless. There is no \"bbq\" flavour to these at all. We threw them out.
The Brisket is good, but only if you get the fatty part at the end. If you get the sliced part it is so dry its like chewing dry wheat. The chicken wings were so over fried that we could not even bite through the skin! They were burnt and not good.
The pulled pork was ok. It was moist with sauce and had an ok flavour but I dont think I would eat it without sauce.
The sauces taste like commercial sauces with sugar added in one and spice added in the other. Nothing special or unique about it.
The fries were decent. Needed more salt. The worst part other then the meat was the Mac & cheese. It was soggy wet noodles quickly heated with shredded cheese. It a was lumpy, grainy, mess. It was sad to say that we threw out over 40 dollars worth of food because most of it was just not good. And NOT BBQ quality.
The Coleslaw...STAY AWAY it pre packaged with commercial watered down dressing.
Sorry Pig Out BBQ... I think you need more practice in the BBQ pit."}
{"text":"I just took out 2 rib dinners, one with bbq and the other honey garlic. I must say these were the tastiest ribs I have had for a long time. I tried them in the first week and they were good but now they are great. Even the onion rings were above most others.
Thanks for the warm welcome and great service as well.
If you have not tried Pig out do yourself a favour and try them"}
{"text":"I was raised in the Southern U.S.  After having married a Canadian and moved to Toronto, I sometimes find I miss BBQ.

This place was like going home.  The food was very good and the man who waited on us went out of his way to charm our 4-year old daughter.   (She was crying because she thought we were going to Licks to get a hotdog.)  He had her smiling in minutes.  She proclaimed the mac and cheese to be the \"best ever.\"

We had the pulled pork sandwiches.  The serving size was huge.  We actually got two meals out of it.

The only suggestion I have (and I mentioned it to the chef) is that sometimes in the south we served sweet potato fries with melted butter combined with honey and cinnamon.  I think I have a secret hope that sauce will be added to the menu as an option.

UPDATE: Ordered delivery from them tonight.  Took 80 minutes, three phone calls and when the delivery arrived, he failed to have the credit card receipt for me to sign.  The food was cold and everyone I spoke to was pretty rude.  Not sure what was going on.  This is unlike my previous experiences."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and tried out their Saturday special: very good value! For $13.95, you get 4 ribs, 4 wings, and fries. The standout for me were the fries. I don't know what they did to them or how they cooked them, but they were sooo good and crunchy!! The wings were also pretty good -- you can choose the sauce on it and I got the carolina spicy. It's supposed to be the spiciest sauce on the menu, but it wasn't that spicy. It's also a bit sweet so it's quite good. I also tasted the parmesan garlic and that was okay -- it's a dry rub and not saucy. The ribs themselves were just okay. The sauce was decent, but the meat was not juicy/fall-of-the-bone. it was a bit dry, but overall the food was pretty decent at a very good value!

The service was quick and friendly too. My partner got a few short ribs instead of the regular, so they actually sent over a few extra without us asking, so that was quite nice! They also came to fill our water partway through, which I wasn't expecting since it was an order-at-the-counter kind of place. Solid place overall!"}
{"text":"We made a dinner reservation at Pig Out for 12 people. We showed up early and ordered our food shortly after. We then waited 50 minutes before any food was delivered. Even a milkshake took 20 minutes to come. 

We watched every other customer and table that came in after us be served before us. At the 35 or 40 minute mark, we asked the owner what the status of our food was and she had the audacity to look annoyed that we even asked. She said that our order was coming up \"next\" but then served two other tables before us. 

When the food finally came, it looked amazing. The brisket was delicious and so was the mac & cheese. But the ribs and pulled pork, which made up the bulk of our order, were dry and overcooked. 

Although the portions are good and the prices reasonable, save yourself the trouble and visit the Licks or Crabby Joes in the same plaza!"}
{"text":"When you hear of a BBQ food spot in the middle of Pickering, you don't usually have a high expectation. Having tried a lot of BBQ pits down south in the states, I do have a high expectation when it comes to quality of the meat and sauce. When it comes to quality of the meat and sauce, it's average to below average. I mean, I wasn't expecting something exceptional and I was right to assume so. I tend to judge a BBQ pit based on the quality of the pulled pork and in this case, it was just average. The meat was a little over cooked and sauce wasn't that flavourful. The beef brisket, ribs and wings were mediocre as well. I should praise the Mac n' Cheese, the bacon bits on top just made it all the more better. In terms of quantity, you will be blown away because man it's a lot of food. The serving sizes are classic southern styled and we had left overs after sharing a JR. Pig Platter and a Pulled Pork Meal between 4 people. So that's a bonus! Service was great and the one girl server we had was really nice. Seating is limited so if you have large groups, make sure you call in advance."}
{"text":"As this was our first time here, we weren't sure what to expect? Surprisingly our food came out quickly. The brisket was delicious and tender practically melted in your mouth. Yumm!! The wings had a great tasting BBQ sauce a little sweet, a little spicy just perfect. And the ribs were cooked perfectly with a nice smokey bbq flavour. We ordered the Jr. Pig out platter, definitely enough food for 2-3 people. Happily it did not disappoint. Staff were all pleasant and helpful as well."}
{"text":"If they had more sauce options, I would give them 5 stars, but the meat alone is worth the 4 stars.  My favorite is the pulled pork, either in a sandwich or a plate.  It is nice and smokey and well separated with no huge clumps.  The ribs are also nice, but you get a lot more meat with the pulled pork.  They serve it with a lovely pickled onion relish, very nice creamy southern style coleslaw, and a huge dill pickle.  The only shortfall is their barbecue sauce.  They have sweet which is pretty good, spicy which is too hat for me to eat even if mixed half and half with the sweet, and smokey which has a nasty fake smoke flavor.  Stick to the sweet and add a dash of hot sauce if you want more heat.  

They have other sides but the only one I have tried is the mac and cheese which is excellent and I recommend it highly.  They also have an interesting signature sandwich which was featured on the TV show \"You Gotta Eat Here\", the boneless rib sandwich.  Try it for the novelty, it is pretty good, but get the pulled pork sandwich if you want way more meat."}
{"text":"After watching the Buzzfeed Worth It video on BBQ and seeing the seemingly delicious photos and positive reviews, I decided to order from here on UberEATS. Everything was so extremely disappointing that I question the legitimacy of all the positive reviews. The ribs ($32) tasted very old, like they were cooked days ago and left out to dry. The chicken dinner, for $30, consisted of two leg quarters that could not even compete with the same offering at fast-food shawarma places. The pulled pork sandwich ($13), tasted like leftover pork drenched in sauce. The fries were very soggy. The prices are also marked-up ridiculously on UberEATS, every dish costs $5-10 more than the price they charge in the restaurant, effectively doubling the prices for many items. I cannot find a single good thing to say about this restaurant. From food quality, portion size, to value, everything was terrible. If you are looking for a good BBQ restaurant, keep looking because this is most definitely not it."}
{"text":"Had the brisket and fries, it's my new to-go place for anything BBQ.  There isn't much around the annex area, so I'm glad a place like this has opened up here."}
{"text":"780 Kingston Road, Unit 6
L1V 1A8
Pickering, ON

Date visited : 04/20/2018

This is our first visit here to eat, yet I have picked up from this location for Skip the Dishes on 2 or 3 occasions.

We ended up here since we couldn't decide where to go.  We were considering sushi or fish n chips at first.  We called Daisuki Sushi to inquire pricing, and we decided against it after reading some Yelp reviews, along with pricing would have hit $60+ CAD for 2 ppl and that's with the mandatory included 10% gratuity.  After deciding against sushi I said let's go for fish n chips, so I plotted our way to Malt and Salt fish and chips (285 Lawson Rd, Scarborough, ON M1C 2J6) ...while already on the way there...my wife looked at me with a grin and said \"let's go for ribs\".  I agreed and I re-Waze'd our way to Pig Out BBQ.

We opted to share a dish, since we don't like to overeat at night.  So we decided on the Chicken Dinner Platter ($39.99 + HST) which includes : 1/2 a chicken + full rack ribs (9 ribs) + caesar salad and a decent portion of fresh cut in-house fries.  We chose the smoky sauce for the ribs, not sure what sauce the 1/2 chicken came slathered in.

For drinks, my wife chose her standard can of Canada Dry ginger ale.  I had packed along our 32oz **Pure Outdoor bottle, which we purchased while on sale promo (from Monoprice.com) of Ice River water from home which was still cool.

Food : 4/5
The fresh cooked cut in-house fries were to our liking.  Just enough crispness and lightly salted.  The caesar salad was good and tasty, creamy dressing with fresh bacon bits (likely made in house as well), tho I forgot to inquire if the croutons were also made in house or not.  Tho the a-la-carte fries large size seems over-priced at $6.95 + HST might order 1x just to confirm portion size

As for the ribs, this gets kinda weird (least for us), out of the 9 ribs we had on the platter, the 1st 2 ribs my wife consumed and the 2 ribs I first consumed were juicy and fall off the bone.  The smoky sauce was really good and complimented the ribs well.  However the 3rd and 4th ribs for my wife and the 3rd through 5th ribs I ate..were not so fall off the bone anymore and not so juicy..they were dry.  Cause between our ribs we consumed the 1/2 chicken, my wife took a 1/4 and I had the other 1/4 with the breast meat.  As stated above, this was our first time eating at Pig Out BBQ, to be honest this is our first visit to a ribs/chicken BBQ resto.  So we were not sure what to expect.  My wife enjoyed her share of the chicken, as for my share..well I usually find chicken breast meat that has been BBQ's usually on the drier side.  So without the smoky BBQ sauce to dip the chicken breast in, it would have been difficult to eat.  Along with the previously mentioned 3rd-5th ribs I had..I had to use the smoky bbq sauce to dip..or else it would have been hard to eat.  When we do ribs/chicken at home we usually bake with Maggi So Juicy, so the end result are never dried out.  I'm curious to know if Pig Out BBQ sells their smoky sauce in bottles or not, would be nice to have their smoky bbq sauce for when we do ribs at home. 

Other thoughts : nice to have the complimentary pickles and coleslaw.  Even tho I avoid coleslaw due to cabbage (gout trigger for me), I tasted a small amount and I liked the flavour.

Repeat visits ?
Yes, we intend to return to try some of their sandwich offerings, and possibly their pulled pork poutine.  Also to see portion size on their large a-la-carte home-made fries.

Method of Payment : Cash/Debit/Credit

{"text":"I want to congratulate the owner of this establishment as he/she did a great job hiring the staff. They are soooooo wonderful and friendly. Not only is the staff wonderful.... The food is as well. It's affordable and very good portion sizes."}
{"text":"This is amazing bbq at amazing prices! Best ribs and wings I've ever had, and the brisket and pulled pork were also really good. There was a great smoke to all the meat, the meat was really tender, and an excellent bbq sauce topped it all off. Mac and cheese and fries sides were great, but I was disappointed with the onion rings. Good as a to go meal, or you can sit down (though you still have to go up to the front to order)."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was really good. Had onion rings as s side which were also good. If you like BBQ this is a place to check out"}
{"text":"10/10 BBQ. Got the pig out platter for 70$ and it was WELL WORTH IT. Came with wings, ribs, sausage, brisket, pulled pork and 3 sides, plenty of food for 4/5 people. The sauces were delish and overall was worth the money. My only complaint is EXTREMELY overpriced cornbread, I'm talking almost 4$ a slice for terrible quality. If your in the mood for some BBQ try this please you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this BBQ spot on Spadina at Harbord. Had the pulled pork tacos and a brisket sandwich and have to say it is great bbq. The room is warm and friendly, when you're ready you just step up the counter and order. The service was quick and friendly and the price is reasonable, especially for the large portions.

My brisket sandwich was jammed with succulent beef smoked to perfection and falling apart. The sweet and spicy sauce, however, could have used a little more punch, but that is a minor complaint. The fries were hand cut and perfectly crisp.

The Pig Out is definitely going to be my regular stop when I have an excuse to visit the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ate at the Toronto location a few times. I love there pulled pork sandwiches, the best I have had in a while. However the rest of the food I found hasn't been anything really special. I recently had the Jr pig out BBQ platter the ribs and wings were great wasn't so fond of the beef brisket and the French fries I had on the side were way overfried won't be eating those again rather just go to the food truck down the street."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during break at school and had the Mac n Cheese with a side of chicken. I watched the chef microwave the Mac n Cheese and take out the chicken from the freezer, warm it up, then slice it. Completely unprofessional and disgusting, don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ eats! Loved the Mac and Cheese, we had a dirty burger was excellent, pig out burger was delicious and the Jr. piglet platter with a corn bread everything was delicious. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time trying food from this place and I do enjoy getting their poutine when I'm in the area. I came during the day on a weekday and it wasn't busy, with only one table occupied. I ordered a pulled pork poutine to go and the service was quick and cashier was really friendly. He let me know that it would not take more than five minutes for the order to be ready. I opted for a sweet sauce, although you have the option to get it spicy instead. The portion size was a pretty good amount, which you could share for two people if you wanted to. Overall, both times I went I had a good experience at this place and would come back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Put on those stretchy pants, you're going to need them. Pig Out BBQ does not hold back. Four of us went there for my Mom's birthday. We seated ourselves and began scouring the menu for meals. The décor was simple and tasteful. We were told to go hungry, very very hungry. 

Upon reading the meaty menu, we decided to share the Pig Out Platter; it said it serves 4. 4 what I don't know, because there was no way we were finishing it. This platter had almost every type of meat they serve! It arrived on 2 large platters; we ended up moving to a table that seats 6 to fit all the food.  

Everything on the platter had a delicious smoky flavour that our server said they smoke all of their meat in-house. All of the meat was so tender, you barely had to chew. This was not a bad thing because by the end, you were so full, chewing was a chore. The ribs were fantastic; tangy and smoky. The brisket could only be moved to your plate with a spoon. It was so tender, it literally melted in your mouth. The pulled pork came in a pile topped with sauteed onions(OMFG) and BBQ sauce. This was probably my favourite meat on the platter. The chicken wings were good, but I'd never had smoked wings before. It was ok. The summer sausage was also fantastically smoked. I stuck with the pork....there may have been some growling, but I did share.... 

The platter came with coleslaw, pickles and 3 sides which turned into 4. We ordered baked beans, sweet potato fries and poutine, but they forgot the poutine and brought fries, so they brought a poutine as well. SO MUCH FOOD. The stars of the many sides were the sweet potato fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were sweet and cooked perfectly. These were the best sweet potato fries I'd ever eaten. We had to wrestle them from my boyfriend. Needless to say, neither of them ended up in the doggy bag.  

This BBQ joint has an easy going atmosphere with great service and melt in your mouth food to match! 

If you're out in Pickering, stop into Pig Out BBQ. You will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I got the spicy pulled pork, sweet potatoe fries and a Dr. Pepper for about 10$, which I thought was well priced for the quality and it comes with a juicy dill pickle and side of coleslaw. The pulled pork was moist and well seasoned. The portion was also quite large. It was exactly what I was anticipating: Nothing gourmet, but fast food done well and right. Buy from the counter and they bring you your food. Service staff was friendly and efficient. Definitely check it out if you're in the area and feel like some tasty meat."}
{"text":"Great food! And it's right next to University of Toronto campus. They run similarly to modern American restaurants- you order at the front and your food will be brought to you. It's a great way to run a restaurant today! Lots of choices to make. Great bbq!"}
{"text":"Pre-ordered the brisket dinner and smoked sausages on the side. Picked up my order and when I get home, it turns out the pickle and coleslaw are missing. I call the restaurant and inform them of this. The person who answered the phone admitted she forgot to include them. I was told when I come next time, I'll receive me an extra pickle and coleslaw... huh? So Pig Out BBQ's manner of dealing with customer complaints is to solicit future business while concurrently offering a solution with no real manner of execution. Am I supposed to come back whenever I feel like having some Pig Out BBQ (whether its months or years down the road) and tell whoever is taking my order that I was cheated out of pickles and coleslaw and was told I would be reimbursed for it whenever I decide to return? 

They also tried to blame it on the fact that they have two websites: pigoutbbq.ca and pigoutbbqpickering.com. I was told I might be confused about whether what I ordered included pickles or coleslaw. Both websites say the brisket dinner includes 1 trimming, coleslaw, pickles, and a dipping sauce (I didn't receive a dipping sauce either). Also, when you google pig out bbq, the former website as opposed to the latter, is the top hit. They both list the location as 780 Kingston Road, Unit #6, Pickering, ON. Why do you have two websites with different prices????

To make matters worse, what I ordered was based on pigoutbbq.ca. it lists the brisket dinner as $14.95. The new and \"correct\" site lists it as $17.95. I was charged $17.95 and was willing to let that go. When I asked to speak to a manager or the owner I was told \"oh they aren't here I don't know where they are\". Drove to a different city for some good BBQ and came home to disappointment. Thanks Pig Out BBQ for the amazing experience. 

PS: For anyone who thinks pickles and coleslaw aren't a big deal, pickles are the palate cleanser that make BBQ what BBQ is. Maybe I'm being a stickler but Pig Out BBQ makes its money from being featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\", the restaurants attention to detail and consumer concerns (all highlighted in the \"You Gotta Eat Here\" segment). Don't be fooled."}
{"text":"I went to Pig Out BBQ and thought it was okay.  Sometimes I want to explore signature sauces and flavors.  This place lacked the special tastes I crave."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Scarborough or Pickering, I love hitting up this spot for a pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. I always get me a side of corn bread to go - and if I'm feeling like a real fatty, I'll order the warm banana bread with ice cream. Love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"I first found out about the Pig Out in Pickering and enjoyed my experience there. When I found out they turned this spot in another Pig Out, I was super hyped!! Love getting a pull pork sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. And I never leave without getting me a side of corn bread to go.

It's a narrow, tight space but it never gets too busy and I always leave satisfied. I'm just glad I don't have to go all the way to Pickering now to get me some Pig Out!"}
{"text":"There is something inherently odd about a joint named after a terribly unhealthy eating habit. 

Like going to a place called \"Type 3 Diabetes & Delicatessen,\" 'cause you know,  Type 1 and Type 2 are just, not HARDCORE enough. Not that you would be likely to remember at that point. 

Dropped by this place as my date and I wanted to quickly munch on something before attending a nearby symposium at U of T and well, this place is pretty laid back. It does not feel like a restaurant, more like, a fast food joint with slightly better furniture. You can tell the main demographic POB is going for are students and people on the go. Since the interior is pretty barren, lacking soul and you can see the very heavy lean on the utilitarian over style.  

How is the food? Pretty middle of the road, if I am honest. I mean, I think a had better at some Montana's in the burbs, which is saying a lot.

If you are not too discerning then this place is alright, although if you have eaten at Electric Mud, Barque or Smoke N' Bones, then I would highly suggest you skip this one unless you are stuck to the immediate neighborhood and have no other choice."}
{"text":"Huge potions.  Nice pulled pork, ribs and chicken  Staff was friendly and patient  Corn bread was a little dry--cole slaw was good.  Small place, we got take out as we were staying nearby.  I would defiinately recommend.  We had the mild sauce and it was just spicy enough and was falavorful"}
{"text":"I was told that this place had good brisket sandwiches from colleagues, friends as well as from Yelp reviews. Also, I had a craving for brisket sandwiches because it has been ages since I have had one, and thought why not go to this place.

The location is right by Spadina and Harbord, and that makes it really accessible by public transit.

I was greeted by a server and I got my orders served to me pretty quickly. As such, I think the service is good. 

Now about the food: I am glad that I have satisfied my beef brisket sandwich cravings with Pig Out BBQ. I ordered a Melted Cheese Brisket sandwich, and sweet potato fries. 

The sweet potato fries were accompanied with dressing on the side and the combination of flavours of the sweet potato fries with the dressing was great. It's not the best sweet potato fries, but it was certainly good sweet potato fries. 

The melted cheese brisket sandwich, along with the coleslaw, were the highlight of my trip here. The brisket was so well cooked that it seemed as though the brisket melted in your mouth. The brisket also had the right amount of fat and right amount of meat. The cheese made the brisket more soft and amazing. 

The coleslaw had the perfect level of bitterness and sweetness needed to balance off the brisket sandwich.

Overall this made me want to come back again for another brisket sandwich, and these guys know how to do brisket sandwiches right!"}
{"text":"I have always lived in durham and recently moved to Pickering and had been meaning to try this place for quite some time. I finally had the opportunity to and decided to go with the brisket which has received good reviews on Yelp. I decided to make it a combo and try the sweet potato fries. 

The service was nice and friendly and the restaurant I felt had a very nice atmosphere.

On to the food... I got my meal and at first glance have to admit I was disappointed it didn't look  like much food and it cost $13 and change. The brisket sandwhich was good it didn't blow my mind nothing too special but a good quality sandwhich which was a lot more filling than it looked. I don't like coleslaw but I tried it and it was okay. The sweet potato fries with the spicy chipolte mayo were the highlight of my meal, they were fantastic.

I would come back but this wouldn't be a restaurant I would frequent like some of the other places close by simply because I feel the prices are too high for what you get. Good food but the value isn't there for me when I go to a close by burrito joint, schwarma, or fish and chips for almost half the cost."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD! I live nearby and have never tried it, but now I can't believe I was missing out. The fries are really tasty, and we got this jalapeño pork burger and it was tasty and smoky and hearty and delicious.  However, the wait time was pretty long even though there was only one other person in the restaurant at the time, which was a bummer. 4/5 overall."}
{"text":"I love this place, the pulled pork sandwiches are awesome. I always get the sweet version. I agree, there could be more of a smokey flavor, but I really don't mind that much. 

The staff is also SO friendly and accommodating. It's rare that I get such good service these days."}
{"text":"This place was worth a stop on a cold night after work.  I decide to stop in since it was in area and on my list.   

I decide to go with Pig Out Burger, no shock there given I tend to try the burgers more.  The amount of food that came with burger for ten buck was pretty good, I believe it was either 6 or 8 ouze patty with a beef brisket and onion rings, a real meal right there.  The patty was juicy and the brisket was tender and had that smoked taste to it

Also had a side of mac and cheese which was creamy and cheese could use a bit more favour but it wasnt terrible,  all and all a great meal, pretty filling and that hard to with me.  I do have come back and try the wings, ribs and bbq on menu but this one I did love."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from a friend, I went to Pig Out BBQ for lunch yesterday, & while I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, I decided to go ahead & try them out anyway.  As it turns out, my apprehension was well-founded.

This place is in southwest Pickering, & since I live in northwest Whitby, it was quite a bit further than I normally go for lunch, but since I had some errands to do in Ajax, it all worked out.  They're located in a small plaza on Kingston Rd, & when I walked in, the atmosphere was casual, but tastefully decorated.  I checked out the menu on the wall, but had to inquire about combos, since they weren't listed anywhere.  It only listed a la carte prices for the sandwiches, sides & beverages.  I ordered the brisket sandwich combo with fries & a can of pop, which came to just over $12 with taxes.

I sat down to wait, & after a few minutes they brought my food out to me.  I ordered my sandwich plain with their spicy BBQ sauce on the side for dipping, as I like to taste the BBQ before adding any sauce (when the BBQ is really good, I don't even use the sauce).  Their brisket wasn't sliced like traditional brisket, but rather broken up into large chunks, which is different, & I can't say that I cared for it, because the chunks kept falling out of the bun, whereas the slices stay where they're supposed to.  The brisket itself wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't remarkable in any way, either.  There were some inconsistencies in that some pieces were a bit dry & tough, & others were softer & more tender.  There was no smoke ring, & only minimal flavour, which was disappointing.  The spicy BBQ sauce had a good kick, & wasn't bad, which was good because I needed to use quite a bit of it on my sandwich.

The fries were hot & crispy, but sadly, they were frozen rather than fresh-cut.  If a place is going to take the trouble to make BBQ, cooked low & slow with pride, then using frozen fries seems in direct contrast with this philosophy.  The coleslaw wasn't bad, & the pickle spear was crisp & fresh, but that doesn't help much when the brisket sandwich was a big disappointment.

It looks like I'm going to have to take my buddy to Buster Rhino's so that he can see what real BBQ is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"Wow. Super fantastic ribs. Some of the best ribs I've had in Toronto. Expensive for a university location. But $20 for a great rib dinner was unexpectedly awesome. 

They need a liquor licence for this kind of food.  But I can't see anything else missing. Food was out in 3 minutes so perfect for quick lunch or dinner. 

Well done boys. I wish you the best."}
{"text":"Very good wings. The wife loves the ribs and there is something about the fries.  Betcha can't eat one.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Hubby and wifey tried this place out on a whim with a bunch of friends. Nothing special, but was not quite disappointing either. Hence, the 3-star rating.

Best bet was the platter that will pretty much give you a taste of most offered in the menu. Wifey and hubby shared a platter that comes with wings, ribs, and brisket with three sides. Don't get your hopes up with the \"smoked\" ribs though because wifey was disappointed with the lack of smokiness to the meat. Brisket was a little chewy. Wings were surprisingly good. Sides were mediocre.

Overall, okay place to try on a last-minute impulse. Unfortunately, wifey and hubby had better home-cooked bbqs."}
{"text":"Went here during Thanksgiving and order the platter for two. (Ribs, wings, beef brisket, pickle, coleslaw sweet potato fries and caesar salad. Definitely big proportions and very delicious. Smokey sauce is superb!"}
{"text":"Lying pricks said they were open. Can't even get chicken wings at this time. 

Half ass advertising for half ass food!

Terrible restaurant with no delivery."}
{"text":"Got a chance a couple of times to eat there

First time I tried the ribs

Unfortunately I got the rib ends and didn't get enough meat etc to savour the ribs

Second time I tried the pulled pork tacos

This definitely hit the spot

YGEH was not wrong for showing up here and wasn't wrong for showing the tacos

Will def come back again"}
{"text":"Really good sized pulled pork sandwich for $3.95 ($3.99?) because of their Monday special. Even though today is Victoria Day, Monday special still applies. Comes with a saran wrap covered pickle spear. Pulled pork is fairly good. Had the smokey style. Also comes in sweet or spicy. Bun was a tad too soft for my liking. Good amount of pork. For that price, definitely a cheap eat. Regular price $5.95."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, and fairly affordable price.

Here are the items I tried and my verdict:

Chicken BBQ: B
Pork Ribs: A+
BBQ beans: A-
Cole Slaw: C

Overall, this is a great place to have some bbq without breaking your wallet."}
{"text":"Ordered from Just Eat, food was good really enjoyed excluding the corn bread which was rock hard and some rib bark was too burnt to chew. We ordered a pig out platter with 4 sodas but it was way over priced 100 with taxes/tip and delivery."}
{"text":"Love love love it. Really the best BBQ I've had. They make yummy cornbread too!"}
{"text":"I'm so thankful a friend told me about this place. How can you not love pulled pork, ribs, mac&cheese with the best corn bread ever! 

I've been here a few times now and the food has been amazing. 

The sampler platter is an awesome option if your not sure what to try. Favourite sandwich is the pulled pork. The bbq sauce has a really unique bite to it. Definitely the best in the city and I've been to a ton of places. 

I highly recommend you try this spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, quick service and friendly staff! I have tried the restaurant a couple of times and each time the food seems to get better. Tried the pig out platter with all the fixings. LOVE the mac and cheese which is the perfect combination of cheesy and creamy. The whole family love the pulled pork. I also picked up the Kale Chicken wrap and for only $8 it was really filling. I'll be bringing my friends around to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Not even in the top 20 Bbq joints.  EXTREMELY dry poor quality meat.  Must have cooked it several days in advance."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with my buddy looking for a quick early dinner.  Was a little skeptical when I saw nobody in the restaurant.  Food came in decent timing and was so delicious that we both polished our plates off.  I ordered the brisket melt (spicy sauce) with side mac n' cheese and my friend ordered the soft tacos (smoky sauce) with side sweet potato fries.  Out of all the items we ordered, I actually found the mac n' cheese the most impressive!  Super creamy and super cheesy = so delicious!

I have had better brisket than this, which is why I'm giving it a solid 4 star rating, but it was a very close second!  I will definitely be returning to this place in the near future!!!!"}
{"text":"Was on a long walk around town and saw this place. The Yelp reviews were strong. And they were right. 

I had the special: 4 wings, 4 ribs and fries. All were amazing. The wings had a smokiness to them I had not tasted elsewhere. I got them with the hot roasted pepper sauce. 

The ribs were peel off the bone. Just like I like them. 

And the fries were super crispy. Perfect. 

All this for $13.95 Canadian (cheap). 

Very casual."}
{"text":"It looks disgusting, when 3 kitchen staff are outside front door having a cigarette.

Poor image for the restaurant, Guess the owner doesn't give a care."}
{"text":"It's very rare to find a restaurant that has great customer service combined with good food at reasonable prices.

Well we have finally found it at Pig Out BBQ! They have one of the best Chicken Wings & Ribs. They will even customize however you like it.

We went for 4 Ribs, 4 Chicken Wings, and for our choice of trimming we went for fries.  It also comes with Coleslaw, Pickles and a yummy Dipping Sauce. All this for $18.95 +tax. For two people, this is just about right and we were so full.

Everything was delicious, we can't even believe how good the food was! The Chicken Wings with Hot Roasted Pepper Sauce was the bomb!

Even the Ribs were so moist and juicy. The fries were crispy and I love their Coleslaw and Dipping Sauce.

But the best part is how nice and friendly the Guy Cashier was. We will definitely come back here for sure and I hope you give this restaurant a try.

*** Very Highly Recommended ***"}
{"text":"Was great smoked beef brisket and fries. I felt the beef brisket was a bit dry though and the fries were salted a slight too much. Overall very good, and ill be looking to try the wings later. It was fairly priced. I didn't eat the coleslaw or pickle though as I don't really like either.

The mac n cheese was really good, but wouldn't be considered the best. I did have to do take out for the mac n cheese and eat later as i was running a bit late (fault was mine).

Overall, decent and a nice place to try out with a group of guy friends. I went for lunch."}
{"text":"Finally tried this! Love the brisket obviously. The fries was soooo goood... Great food, cheap price! We ordered 4 brisket dinner with potato salad and pulled pork burger with fries. We can't even finished it! Will definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Have always been curious about this place. Tucked away behind these bigger franchise is a gem. On my trips to Texas, always yearned for a great BBQ. This place is the best I have managed to find. We got the Pig's platter for four to five people. It was a lot more generous. We have enough for seconds tomorrow. The ribs, brisket and wings are perfectly tender and delicious. I highly recommend this place for family dining or having a party. 

They deliver too. Excellent"}
{"text":"Tons of food.  Brisket and the ribs were my favourite.

Prices are average.  We had the pig out platter.  definitely good for 5-6 people.  
Mac and cheese was good.  Cornbread had good flavour but it was kind of dry and there was no butter.  

I was surprised by the reviews of the ribs being dry b/c I found them to be quite juicy.  Wings good as well.  The pulled pork was good, but tbh I'm a bit over pulled pork.

Fries were good and crispy.  Mac and cheese not the best I've had, but good.  Coleslaw was the only thing I didn't really like.  It was really acidic.

BF had the brisket melt.  Didn't care for the onion rings, and the sandwich could have had more meat, but overall was tasty.  

Good service."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is one of the bigger disappointments I've had in a while. When I heard that there was a BBQ joint in Pickering, I got so excited. Pickering tends to be the land of fast-food and mall parking lot chain restaurants so I loved the fact there was an independent restaurant that did not rhyme with Tack Pastors or Bone Tar. I especially loved that it was a BBQ joint. 

I've had my fair share of good BBQ all over the US and Canada and I tend to like most BBQ. I mean you can't really go that wrong with BBQ (or at least I thought). Unfortunately, this place was a huge disappointment. 

In terms of menu I prefer if a BBQ place allows you to customize your own meat choices. Here they have a bunch of pre-designed platters but no \"choose two meats and a side\" option. In fact the only two meat diner options is Ribs and Chicken. We ended up ordering a lot of food for take out: ribs, chicken, pulled pork sandwiches, baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, and onion rings. 

I'll start with the positive. The pulled pork sandwich was good. It's pulled pork and onions on a very soft delicious bun. I tend to agree with some of the other reviews that the bbq sauce is WAY too sweet but all in all this was a pretty good sandwich. If I was looking to have just a sandwich again I may consider ordering this.

The chicken was also good. Nothing overly special but nothing really that wrong with it. I found the meat itself to be a bit overly smokey (but not a good smokey flavour more like an artificial liquid smoke flavour) and the sauce to be a bit sweet but it was okay. 

I thought the ribs were terrible. I tend to like ribs that fall of the bone but these ribs were so tough! I could barely eat the meat off the bone let alone let it fall off the bone. Again I found these to be a tad on the oppressively (artificially) smokey side as well. 

To make matters worse the sides were also bad. The baked beans and the coleslaw were so bland they both went untouched (and wasted) after everyone had tried them. These are things that need a bit of flavour or kick, especially when pairing them with BBQ but they were just completely flavourless. The potato salad was iffy.

I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this place. The idea of having a bbq joint in Pickering excited me so - but next time I'm just going to opt for a mall parking lot chain restaurant because even though the pork and chicken were okay, BBQ isn't BBQ without a good side and this place just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Nothing special but definitely above average.

Always have quick service, good food, specials are very competitively priced."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! Great value for your money. I mean, it's no 'Barque' but it'll do the trick when you're in the mood for BBQ and don't want to spend an arm and a leg. When given the option of what BBQ sauce to get with your meat, go with the hot or smokey. Sweet is just too sweet (and this is coming from a girl who loves sugar). The Mac and cheese is yummy, and the fries are really good-- fresh cut and always well done, which is how all fries should be..."}
{"text":"One star because of the nice folks and quick service. The Chinese guy running the place seemed like a nice dude.

I hate giving out bad reviews, but this place deserves it. I ordered take out (rib and chicken combo and 1lb honey garlic wings)

As I write my review, a few words come to mind. 

\"OLD\" , \"REHEATED\", \"NOT FRESH\",  \"TOO SMOKEY\" , \"SAUCE TASTES LIKE ASH AND DRIPPINGS\"

The food is not sitting well and I really do not feel well. The food industry is cutthroat and you only get one audition. This was PIG OUT BBQ's audition and it failed MISERABLY

Will NOT be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often on our way back from working in Markham. Like a craving, the brisket is amazing. She does the pulled pork. All so good. Great quality and great service. Not sure what else to say it's just a great spot to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great little bbq place near the St.george  campus. After discovering this place on yelp I decided to check it out. The food here is great. Portions are huge and there is alot of variety.  Been here four times now. Their burgers are amazing as well as the brisket. Not a big fan of their sides though."}
{"text":"Everything was average. Ribs were dry and forgettable, wings were nothing special, and brisket was super fat. Coleslaw was average too."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Harbord Village - the BBQ meats here are great! I ordered the smoky beef tacos and upgraded to the combo for an extra 3 dollars. The restaurant is small but clean and relatively tidy. Food comes out quick and the servers remember your face to bring the food to your table. I tried both the smoky and spicy and liked the sweet smoky flavors more. The mac and cheese side is also quite delicious. I didn't really care for the coleslaw so that was a miss for me. My friends had ribs and wings and enjoyed their meals as well. 

Pig Out BBQ is reasonably priced and does good food. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have always enjoyed the food, whether it's been the ribs, chicken, wings, brisket, pulled pork, or whatever special they've offered. It's been all good but I have to mention the Pig Out Burger. It's quite possibly my all-time favourite burger. It starts with an 8 ounce beef patty and gets topped with a slice of beef brisket and an onion ring. Yummm!!! Ask for lots of napkins.

If a burger isn't your thing, try the pulled pork or the ribs or the wings. I like to mix the sweet and the spicy BBQ sauces. Nice combination.

The atmosphere is cozy and they have a collection of pig figurines that could be conversation starters."}
{"text":"Generous portions, super quick delivery via UberEats.

Food arrived hot and delicious.  The Smokey BBQ sauce had a hint of sweetness and you can smell the fire.  Mac and Cheese is super cheesy and gooey.  Perfect comfort food.  The small fries was more than enough for two, but the cornbread is a bit on the dry side.

Will order again."}
{"text":"The pulled pork here is really good. Not the best I ever had, but quite good. The cornbread is just okay; I found it pretty dry and couldn't finish it. But this is good solid BBQ downtown Toronto, and I will return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The special of the menu - 4-piece ribs and 4 wings of special sauces (shown here are parmesan garlic and Carolina spicy). The combination of the creamy parmesan and the richness of garlic was very pleasant - not overbearing but has strong presence. The sweetness and the spiciness of Carolina spicy was another dimension of pleasant combination that encouraged all of my palates to participate in this meal. The smokey pork ribs were juicy the moment your teeth digs in, but had some dry spots which were a bummer. Possibly due to us walking in at awkward timing of the day, but the fries were, although flavourful, were a bit too dry and salty for my taste. (My friend claimed it was \"extremely good tasting and possibly within top 3\"). All this filling meal for $14, right beside my school of University Of Toronto is a sure spot for me to visit later on.

Personally, it would be a 5 star for someone who doesn't eat salty food normally if the fries were less salty, and if the pieces on the ribs are not too thin - too thin of meat is easy to dry than thicker ones but that one's everyone's wish."}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing BBQ/smoked meats.

There's a dish called \" the nacho fries\", it's the best nacho fries in the city. Delicious chunks of juicy beef brisket with a whole whack of toppings.

The staff are honest and hardworking individuals.

The decor suits the food and the ambiance is that of a fast food BBQ joint  that doesn't have table service. TVs, rock music on the radio etc.

If this place had beer on tap they'd be laughing; it could be a small sports bar, and would be a perfect spot to enjoy a pint.

Where are all the collard greens? I would give this place 5 stars if it only had some better vegetable options. There are no vegetables anywhere on the menu except if you order a burger or something with banana peppers as a topping, or they might have a salad somewhere on there but it's probably like that salad from the pizza place in Family Guy. Secondly about the sides: the coleslaw is bland as hell, the potato salad is from a bucket and I haven't been able to try the rest. The fries are crispy and tasty as hell on a good day.

However with all of that said, I would say it's one of the best places in the neighbourhood for lunch."}
{"text":"BBQ only two blocks from where I work. Why must the food gods tempt me so. Tried the beef brisket melt $8.95 and two soft tacos with pulled pork $6.95. Both were pretty decent. Only complaints was that the beef brisket had some big chunks of fat and the pulled pork for the tacos were a bit tough. Both meals came with coleslaw and dill pickle. I hate dill pickles. 

There were different flavours offered for the meat: smokey, spicy or sweet. I got the beef brisket smokey and the pulled pork sweet. I really couldn't taste the difference.

I also DO NOT recommend getting sandwiches to go like I did because the bread was soggy by the time I got home. I only live 10 minutes away too. If going for takeout I recommend just plain meats like ribs or wings. I'm gonna have to try these another time or when the BBQ gods tempt me once again. 

3 stars because I have had much better beef brisket and pulled pork elsewhere but because its so close to me I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap smoke house geared towards students. Daily specials include a sandwich with fries usually which are about $7. Clean and fast service, came here twice already and enjoyed both times!"}
{"text":"I always skip the sauce to see what the BBQ really tastes like. No smoke on the pulled pork, none on the \"brisket\". Brisket is in brackets because it looks more like a roast and is not sliced like a brisket. Mac N Cheese was macaroni in cheese sauce with two cheeses on top. It was al dente, not smooth and creamy.

It would seem that all the sauces come from the same base with either sugar or hot sauce added. Looks like a small electric southern pride smoker. Guaranteed to not be smoky and the holding oven removes more of the smoke flavour.

Best thing in my opinion was the ribs. They didn't put the sauce on the side as requested, so I can't comment on the true taste. No smoke ring and the same generic base sauce with a twist for the ribs. Of course, no smoke ring, just like the \"brisket\" and the pulled pork.

Coleslaw was standard. I give up on anybody making good baked beans. From the other reviews, that was a good decision..."}
{"text":"No way i am going to rate this restaurant any less than 5 stars.

Spacious, stroller friendly, welcoming staff, awesome grill smell once you step in the restaurant.

We couldn't decide what to eat so we ordered a platter.
Three trimmings: onion rings, potato salad, macncheese
It comes with coldslaw
Meat platter: ribs, briskets, pulled pork, smoked sausages and wings

Their homemade macncheese is phenomenal, a must have item.
Onion rings are chubby and crispy.
A bit disappointed in the potato salad because i think it is lack of flavor.

Their coldslaw!!! Perfect balanced of sweet and sour. Crunchy veggies and no watery at the bottom. I always skip the coldslaw from other restaurant even thou it is free, but i would pay for coldslaw in here.

Ribs are juicy and tender. Brisket melts in the mouth. And pulled pork is nicely done. Smoked sausages are full of flavour (Starting to run out of words lol) chicken wings are crispy outside and still juicy inside, which is hard to come by. (But i dont really like the garlic and parmesan flavor i choose, maybe the flavor is just not strong enough to stand out in the platter)

Anyway we come to the conclusion that we dont need to wait for ribfest anymore lol"}
{"text":"A casual restaurant. You seat yourself after ordering at the counter. The service is average; I was pleased but not wow'ed. The decor is cute!! They have these small ceramic pigs. 

The food is well-priced and delicious! We both ordered the day's special, which was 4 wings and 4 ribs +fries for 13.95. 

Unfortunately they don't offer patio seating, but there's an open window and table at the front of the restaurant.

I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price. Beef brisket burger with fries were incredible. Smoky, and tender as hell. Doesn't get much better than that, especially at 8.95. Service was real great, the owner was real nice and made sure everything was okay. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"It was an awfully hot day when I went, so going to grab some smokey fresh BBQ was perfect. I really felt that portion size was fair and the food quality was amazing for the price. I had a more sweet flavor and my boyfriend had a super spicy one for our pulled pork sandwiches and I crave it from time to time afterwards!! It's a bit far for us personally, but we want to make plans to come back and try more things! Loved the staff, cute pigs everywhere and interesting seating layout! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all, and judging by the fact that there were 3 employees and one patron (me), I'd say the place needs a yelp-rescue (a yelpcue? Or since its BBQ a yelpcueque?)

On my visit, the debit machine was down and I was low on cash, so I wasn't able to sample as much of the menu as I would have liked, but the pulled pork sandwich was a-ok. The place looks simultaneously rustic and modern, open concept and clean. 

Today they had a $3.95 deal on the pork sandwich, but the pickle and coleslaw are no longer included (now costs another $1), so you really only save $1 over regular prices. Despite the deal, I was the only customer at 12:30pm, so I'm worried for this place - hope it catches on. 

Ps: there are other weekday lunch specials - see photo."}
{"text":"Very neat little place that prides themselves on their pork. I had the Brisket Sandwich. It was messy and satisfying."}
{"text":"I went to Pig Out BBQ with high expectations and was definitely let down.

When you order the pulled pork dinner, you get a huge hunk of meat on a single bun. This hunk of meat is topped with barbeque sauce with another small cup of barbeque sauce to go with it. Unfortunately, the pulled pork had little taste and was soggy - made more unpleasant by the large quantity. The mac and cheese was great, and definitely the only thing pulling this review up. The staff are pleasant to talk to though there is sometimes a wait. Seating is limited!

{"text":"I came here twice before writing a review.

Overall the food tastes quite good, but the meat is a little dry. Also, the brisket was sliced a bit on the thin side... maybe they did it that way because it wasn't tender enough? Most of the meat they gave me was from the lean part of the brisket, so next time I'll ask for meat from the fattier part and see how it is.

It's also not cheap, expect to dish out $15-20 for a meal here."}
{"text":"Hubby loves BBQ, and brisket is his fave, so when I saw great Yelp reviews for the brisket at Pig Out BBQ. I decided to surprise him with some.

Thank you Yelpers, he was very happy with the takeout I brought home when I didn't want to cook, so I win!

The brisket was super tender, lightly smokey and had just enough sauce so the beef flavour is not hidden.

Corn bread was a bit sweet and a tiny bit dry but very good all the same and he also enjoyed the beans.

The Mac and Cheese had a sweet and herbal flavour that wasn't his favourite but still very cheesy.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We got a platter to test everything out and are really pleased.  We liked the brisket the best, but everything was good, including all the sides.  The molasses beans are worth coming back for.  We are so full and have enough leftovers for about 3 days.  Definitely worth a try if you like classic bbq.  I am going to sleep for a few hours after this for sure, just because I am that full.  =)"}
{"text":"I've gone to Pig Out BBQ twice now and both times were amazing!

The first time I went, I shared the Jr Pig Out Platter and that was great! The ribs fell directly off the bone, the brisket was covered in a delicious BBQ sauce. Everything about it was delicious.
The second time I got a Pig Out Platter split among 4 people. The ribs yet again did not disappoint, the mac and cheese sides was great! This trip was at the Ajax location which has nacho poutine! 

For dessert, we ordered this banana bread vanilla pudding. I'm not much of a big sweet tooth and but it definetely hit the spot for me. The warm banana bread was served with a scoop of ice cream on the side. Such a simple yet unforgettable dessert!

Will definetely be going back"}
{"text":"BEST BBQ IN DOWNTOWN! Love this place. It's a go to spot for me at least once a week. They always have great specials everyday and the pulled pork sandwich is to DIE for. They always sell out so make sure you go early. The prices are great and the staff are even better. Always so friendly and quick service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Maybe cheap BBQ food for students but the $40 for a platter of two, including wings, beef brisket, pork ribs, fries, potato salad, and coleslaw was not worth the mediocre food. If you haven't eaten at Barque, I suppose this place would be a 4 or 5 star. Would not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Overall very decent BBQ.

I had the piglet platter for $15.95, all of the components where good. I thought the price was great, for the amount and quality of food.  My only complaints were that you had to go to the counter to order and pay (then when paying with debit, forced to say yes or no to a tip) and the fact that they do not offer beer? If they sold beer I may of bumped this place to a 5!

No question I'll be back for take out."}
{"text":"I had the wings and tried the warm banana bread pudding. The wings were excellent and the bread pudding disappointing. 

The Carolina Spice wings were hot and flavourful. The size was bigger than most places and the order includes fries. The fries were good too. 

When you get there, you order, sit down, and they bring your food to the table. This isn't bad except you have to pay before you sit. You have no idea what kind of service you will get thus can't make a good guess on the quality of service. Since this was my first time there, I was clueless and did the traditional 15%"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review - because I've been back a few times:  and sadly, it seems only the beef brisket is really good.

Now - I must say - the service is pleasant.  They seem helpful and go out of their way - but I made the mistake of ordering their full platter - and I'm SO sorry I did.  Some of it was nice - and the sausage was 'meaty,' and the brisket was almost as good as it often is great - but I spent the next several days finishing up this carnivore's 'feast' - and I felt awful finishing it.  I mean it made me feel physically terrible - for DAYS.  I mean I felt messed up - like several days were 'taken' from me.

Now - one great thing - is they have nice BBQ sauces.  3 choices.  The smokey is nice, and spicy is great.

Previous review:

When I first picked up food from this place I thought I would TRY the beef brisket - because I haven't much liked it at other places before - but WOW.  The brisket here is the best I've ever had - and the best thing on their menu.

I tried most of what they serve on my first big take out order - and most of their food was OK - but mostly just OK.

The ribs were OK - but it's necessary to ask them to not cut the ribs into pieces - because the DO dry out by the time you can eat them.   

I agree with the other reviewer about the pulled pork.  Meh.

But the sauces they offer to put on the food or on the side are nice.  The spicy is very nice.

And the service has been pleasant and they go a little out of their way to add and be generous and pleasant.  

But let me say again that you HAVE TO TRY THE BRISKET.  I ask for it with TONS of fat - and it's very tasty and melts in your mouth.


Oh - and just to complain a little - their website is HARD AS HELL to find.  If finally found it after searching and searching and searching.  The problem is that when you search for the Harbord and Spadina location - you get the website for their other (Steeles?) location.  And I could be wrong, but there may be slight differences in prices - and it bugs me that if you order delivery - you pay WAY - WAY MORE!  They don't have their own delivery - so you find them through the website of some other company - I think you can use Hurrier and some other delivery company - but the prices on that website are HIGHER than if you go to the store (for the same food) - AND they charge a fairly high delivery fee AND then you also have to tip.  So to get food delivered from this place you pay ABOUT TWENTY BUCKS MORE for delivery!!!!  That is simply outrageous - and makes me angry as hell.  (Now this MIGHT have improved A TINY BIT) with a new delivery option - but I'm still pretty pissed about the big delivery jack up fee.)"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good! They got the mac n cheese down & the beef brisket & cheese sandwich was on point. And the cornbread...Ohhhh the cornbread. Was looking for good southern BBQ in the GTA & I'll def be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved the pulled pork with sweet potato fries! Service was quick and fast. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BBQ meat here is by far the best I've had and the prices are super reasonable. My only complaint would be the side dishes. They're nothing special and I know that I can make a better mac n cheese without much effort. 

Will definitely recommend to others and be back."}
{"text":"Very tasty pulled pork! Wings could be better though. I've ordered delivery from them several times and they haven't been late yet."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent, pretty good standard bbq fare and the service is pretty good too, but it's pretty expensive for what it is"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food from here.  We find it best to order the platters as you get to sample everything. Really good BBQ"}
{"text":"BBQ that is nothing short of a spiritual experience. I was in Toronto for a few days and went to their Toronto location. It was so good I had to do it again on the way home. 

I had a sliced brisket dinner. I have a smoker and have done my own brisket on a few occasions. This was heavenly. I got a generous portion with Smokey BBQ sauce. The brisket was very moist with great smoke flavour. I had their French fries as a side and I was equally impressed. They were very flavourful and hot. 

I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man. This is freaking amazing BBQ! Everything on the menu is fantastic, but GET THE BRISKET!!! The staff is so friendly. While we were eating, we witnessed many customers interacting with the staff and they called three customers by name! Great customer service super friendly. But even if the customer service was bad (AND IT ISN'T) I would do anything for brisket from Pig Out BBQ!!!!! It's been 30 minutes since I arrived home from eating there and I am already planning my next trip there!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Not only one of my favourite restaurants in the Durham region but also my favourite BBQ joint!!! I've been to many and this one, in my opinion, is the best! To boot.. Best bang for your buck as well. Can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch with a group of 6. Some good barbecue items. It's really good for the area. Super casual. The only thing we complained about were the water glasses (not sure if the dishwasher didn't work or the glasses need replacing or cleaning). I do miss Buster Rhino's though."}
{"text":"This place was okay... think of cheap restaurants near college for students. 

I wanted to load my belly with bbq for cheap price and this place did the job.  Might visit again"}
{"text":"Went for a Saturday lunch, very quiet, only 1 other person was there. Ordered The Special, which consisted of 4 wings, 4 ribs, and fries = $13.95 and the Beef Brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries = $13.95. Portions were large, especially The Special. However, the wings and ribs were lacking that sticky BBQ sauce and the meat itself was a little dry (not falling off the bone). The beef brisket however was bombastic, very flavourful and juicy! Overall it was a good first impression, but next time we'll ask for more sauce for the wings and ribs."}
{"text":"Tried the pulled porc sandwich with Bbq sauce and onion rings. Pulled porc was alright but nothing special. Coleslaw and dill was good. Service was a bit unclear if we order at table or go to cash. Had to get up to get a fork and knife since they only brought food basket to my table. I had some high hopes for this place since I went out of my way to stop here following my search on web and say \"you gotta eat here\"  did a show on them. Atmosphere feels like a franchise chain and not the homey style I like to visite. I would have liked a one person sample plate, would have liked to try ribs, wings and brisket. I saw a family of six order everything on menu they seems to be enjoying. I wish them the best, but Saturday supper time no line up outside ;(  and restaurant half full."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple quick lunch to go,  pulled pork, slaw, pickle, and baked beans.
Service was quick and efficient, and the sandwich was good, but just pork, very skimpy on sauce and smoke. My total was about $8, so it was good value. The place is clean and over  managed. The manager keeps an evil eye on the staff, and they seem to fear her. So much for ambience!

Everything is sweetened, and the BBQ smoke is deliberately bland. They add sugar to the under cooked beans,  the sauce, and the out sourced cole slaw. At least the pickle was sour!

The owner is talking down to us with these offerings, so I doubt if I'll go back.

ed. note:  I put a review of Pig Out BBQ somewhat like this in Chowhound Toronto, and the manager immediately slammed me, and tried to get her own fake review published.  She was dropped right away by Chow, and then got her staff to put two favorable reviews in Chow; they were also dropped within a day."}
{"text":"Really great ribs and my boyfriend loves the pulled pork sandwich. :) Will definitely be back!"}
