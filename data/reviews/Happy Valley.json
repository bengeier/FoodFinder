{"text":"BBQ duck and pork, roast pig, roast and soya sauce chicken, noodles, soup, and rice are their fare. It is your typical Cantonese BBQ house fare with reasonable prices and taste by the bucket load. Service is indifferent but highly efficient.

Be forewarned. Take a pile of napkins with you to the washrooms. Some to dry your hands and the rest so you do not have to touch the door handles which are always coated in something that sticks to your hands. The tables and eating utensils are always clean.

This place has bargain basement prices. Barbeque duck on rice with a bowl of soup and a soft drink is $8.45. A glutton's feast, double duck and double meat of a different kind will cost $12.95 complete with soup and drink.

There is a specialty duck that they serve. They only make one or two daily and it is called pipa duck. It is named as such after the Chinese stringed instrument the pipa. It is flattend, like a steam roller, and roasted with slightly different seasonings than BBQ duck. It is a little drier than barbecue with crispier skin. This is duck at its finest. You can only order a half duck or whole duck.

They are not licensed.

I have never been disatisfied with a meal here and I have been eating at the Happy Valley for 12 years now. Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic hong kong diner. HK diners are true fusion food as they are the natural result of over 100 years of intermingling between the British empire and the southern chinese cuisine of the old colony of hong kong. You will get to experience different spins on familiar dishes like fried chicken with a black bean sauce.   

Try the sizzling rice dishes. It is like having rice crispy squares for dinner. 

For a price between $10-$15 per person, you can have a filling dinner with enough left overs for lunch the next day. That is what I call a good deal.

{"text":"We stumbled upon this fabulous restaurant on our very first trip to Calgary.  And now, upon each and every return trip, we head back there.  Recently, when driving back to Edmonton from a weekend in Lake Louise, we drove into Calgary (significantly out of the way) just to have a meal at Happy Valley.

The food is fantastic.  We especially the green beans in black bean sauce and the salt and pepper squids.  But everything we've tried has been great.  Even our toddler gobbled up the green beans.

The only weird thing is that they serve their hot tea in plastic cups.  But for this quality of food, I'll take a few quirks.

After five years of living in Edmonton, I have yet to discover a Chinese restaurant of this quality.  This restaurant is one area where Calgary has Edmonton beat."}
{"text":"I eat at Happy Valley on a fairly regular basis because the food and the prices keep me coming back.

The place itself is ugly and the bathrooms are..gross. The waitresses range from friendly to surly but the service is usually pretty good.

If you are white, its possible they will give you only one of their two menus. Both menus are in English, so if you only receive one ask for the second one as well. The second menu has (in my opinion) their best dish in it: Beef Brisket and Greens. The brisket is falling apart soft and flavorful and  served on of a bed of rice. 

Although they offer a selection of BBQ meats, we almost never order them and tend to stick to the meat and vegetable dishes from the menu."}
{"text":"I can't even give a review on the food, but I can give a review on the service - or lack there of. 

My friends and I came in to have a late night dinner and didn't notice the hours posted on the door so we figured this restaurant would be opened late - hmm, guess not. As we were getting ready to sit down the waitress gives us menus and says: \"Hurry up, we're closing soon.\" My friend quickly asked the waitress if they have BBQ duck and she said: \"No! No more!\" We looked at each other, looked at the time and realized we wouldn't be able to eat when they were closing in 30 minutes. So we decided to leave and the cashier asked us why we were leaving so soon and my friend politely said: \"You guys are closing and it just doesn't give us enough time to order and eat.\" The cashier (maybe the owner?) told us: \"It's okay, we can wait.\" But really, who wants to eat at a place after we were rudely told to hurry up.

Honestly, if you're having a bad day, take a break and fix yourself. If you hate being a waitress then find a job elsewhere. I REFUSE to go to an establishment with that kind of RUDENESS!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good if you can ignore how dirty the place is.  The bathrooms are especially gross.  The BBQ duck and pork is great though and the prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"How can I describe Happy Valley to you? Fluorescent lighting, lightly tiled floors, booths that remind me of a diner. The appeal here is soooo not in the decor. Nor is it in the plastic cups and jugs that they serve tea out of... or is that actually part of its charm?

Happy Valley is known for its specialty BBQ menu. It was out of BBQ pork when I was there last, so I ordered the duck. What I've discovered is that I'm not such a fan of duck, though my meal mates all dug in to try a piece.

The prices of dishes are inexpensive. And I'd say you're better off sharing a few items instead of ordering just one for yourself. That way, if you don't like the duck either, you've still got a range of dishes to try.

While the servers are friendly and fairly on-the-ball, it's safe to say on this one that you're definitely coming for the food."}
