{"text":"I have been here two times. The first time, the service was okay, as I went on a weekday when there was not a lot of people. But the second time, I was there on the weekend and it was very difficult to get service. It took maybe 10 minutes at the very least to get the attention of a waitress to put in our order. Food wise, everything was reasonably priced and the taste was okay. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"We have been here a half dozen times. I would give a four star rating for the food. They're getting a two star rating because I would classify the restaurant as a service nightmare. Once in our numerous visits has the service been what I would consider good. The last time we went, after sitting for 15+ minutes waiting to order, we had to fetch a waitress from across the restaurant. We ordered two dishes and pointed out a tight timeframe on our end. 35 minutes later we flag down another waitress (who happened to be the one we had the night of good service) and asked if she could track down our order. It was never entered. 50+ minutes into a dinner with no food and nothing coming we had to walk out and skip dinner. More irritating was the fact that the restaurant was at maybe 25% capacity. Good food but not where I'll choose to spend my money. Someone needs to clue in the manager/owner that we're in a down economy and purse strings are tightening."}
{"text":"Came here after a birthday dinner tonight. Was looking forward to getting some good hk dessert (I saw on their fb page that they had french toast).

We came here a little before 9pm so it wasn't too busy. The decor here is industrial with a touch of asian. Not like other hk cafes i've see in YYC. We were handed menus, and had plenty of time to look through them. I think I spent a good 5 minutes looking around for a server to notice us after we had closed our menus (we were seated right beside the service station). There were lots of employees milled around the area, but no server came to take our order until I let the hostess know. Even then, she tried to get a server for us, but the server seemed really distracted by other teables even as she started hovering near our table. 

I really wanted to try their honey toast (as thats what I saw on their fb page). Unfortuantly that part of the menu wasn't avaiable yet. I don't understand why people put things on the menu that aren't avaiable... We got an order of their HK style French toast with honey instead, there was an option to add a scoop of ice cream for an additional $2 (which we did not opt for). I also ordered the classic cold hk style milk tea. The server rtried to off me their \"super chill milk tea\". I asked for an explanation of this \"super\" item, and she told me the difference is that it would be served colder and offered with a bucket of ice... For a extra dollar... Even as \"appealing\" as that sounds I opted out.

After a much extended wait, we got our order! The bf did ask me numerous times why it took so long to make a slice of toast though. Our milk tea came first, it was served in a glass milk bottle (so cute); the tea wasn't as strong as I'm used to though. We got our french toast... with ice cream; as previously mentioned we hadn't requested such, and was glad that we didn't have to send it back and wait again or pay the extra cost.

Overall, not too bad for a newly opened resturant. Would have expected better service, but am looking forward to a future visit to try their entrees."}
