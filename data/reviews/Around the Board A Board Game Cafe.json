{"text":"We had time to kill before our flight out of Phoenix and were so glad we found this little gem! Tons of games and the workers are the sweetest people. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love how kind the owner is and the food is great. If you want a place for lunch and a place where kids can play board games this is your place. I had the mango smoothie and a sandwich it was awesome."}
{"text":"This place closed down. Which is unfortunate, because they just opened and I went there for the first time near when they opened. I was looking forward to bringing all my friends here for fun times and good company. The owner was super nice and we got to know her a bit. Fun concept idea, too bad it couldn't last :/"}
{"text":"Fresh bread,  good selection. You have to try the Pesto aioli. Board games at every table. Lots of stuff for kids."}
