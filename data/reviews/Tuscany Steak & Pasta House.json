{"text":"Every time I visit family near Tuscola, I visit Tuscany for dinner, and I am never disappointed.  For a small town, the food is very good, and the staff is incredibly friendly.  It's a wonderful surprise, especially considering that I'm used to 4 and 5 star restaurants in Chicago, some even Michelin rated.  If you shop in the outlet mall or stay in town and want a nice dinner, don't bother driving 30 boring minutes to Champaign or Mattoon - just head a mile down Route 36 to Tuscany.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"RUN - from this place!  With many chef changes and bad management this restaurant is headed downhill fast.  The fried foods reeked of OLD GREASE with that awful after taste of something rancid.  HALF the items on the menu were not available as they had very little food.  We were told the night before they actually had to close down at 6:30pm due to no food available to serve.  The BUTT steak is nothing more then a wedge of tasteless beef roast and not a tender cut at all.  You should think twice before choosing this place as an edible food source.... yuck!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining at the new Tuscany Restaurant ever since it opened under new ownership in July 2011.  What a welcome change from the usual standard fare of burgers, tacos and pancakes!  Although they always have a good selection for lunch, dinners have been fantastic!  My husband usually orders a fish dish and I get either steak or pasta.  Last week he had the Stuffed Flounder.   It not only looked great but tasted delicious - and I don't even care for fish!   We have never been disappointed in our selections.  

The wait staff have always been very professional, our table is never left cluttered and their Chef Bobby actually visits our table!  I have eaten at some fine establishments all over the world, and must say that Tuscany Steak and Pasta is one of the finest I've ever been in.

Thank you for opening in our little town, Tuscany!"}
{"text":"I have had dinner at this restaurants several times when I come to Tuscola for a shopping trip to the Tangier's Outlet Mall. I always have shrimp and desert and we have a really nice dinner. The atmosphere is pleasant and even though I have only had the shrimp, I'm sure other items are just as good. Th restaurants has a lot of pasta dishes, but I'm not a big fan of pasta. The staff is very attentive. One time my mother got sick and they went out of their way to help her. She was nauseous when she arrived and they were very nice."}
{"text":"Stayed in town for business and was told to go to \"the good Italian restaurant down the street\" by the front desk lady at the hotel.  Since there really is not much to choose from in the town, we took her advice.

It was about 8:00 PM when we arrived and there were some vehicles in the parking lot.  The place is definitely in an older building.  Inside, there was one large table of people and a few others with 2-4 people at them.  The inside had huge chandeliers, white brick walls and other items that they tried to make it look more upscale.

Our waitress told us that the chef's specialty was seafood but that her favorite was their pasta dishes.  She also told us that the nights special, stuffed flounder, looked amazing!  We started with salads and bread.  Both of those were good but who can mess up a salad?  The bread was soft on the inside and had a good crust but seemed really light in weight.  I ordered the special, Stuffed Flounder, with rice pilaf.  My co-worker ordered a ribeye with a baked potato.  There was a decent amount of food on the plate as we both also got green beans, the vegetable of the day.  My food did look good but upon taking a bite, I was not impressed.  My food tasted like plastic.  Literally, plastic.  It had such a strange taste.  The green beans were soaked in butter which I think was due to them not knowing how to make them taste good otherwise.  My co-worker's ribeye was done correctly but still he said it was not all that great.

For the prices we paid, in a small town, you would expect much better food.  My suggestion is get the salad and bread and head home."}
{"text":"Spring 2012 - CLOSED!  This place has gone through three owners with this name. Was previously Liga's.  When Sonny was there (see the 2009) reviews, this place was fantastic. Huge portions for a good price. The middle owners were horrible (microwaved veggies, but still cold). The final owners tried, but by that point, I think everyone in town had given up.  Sure wish we could bring Sonny back."}
