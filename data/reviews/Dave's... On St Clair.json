{"text":"In the area from Buffalo NY had such a great dinner . Salmon was outstanding . Steak sandwich was amazing . cool atmosphere . Felt very comfortable in this great place . Service A+ kraft beer awesome. Thanks"}
{"text":"Ordered the white pizza and it was over cooked and burnt. The staff seemed more interested in gossiping then looking after the customers."}
{"text":"My favourite pub in my hood. They have the BEST BURGER in north end and the beer is cheap. The staff are super friendly and they host many events through the week: trivia, jam night, sports games. This place res"}
{"text":"Dave's is my favourite place to visit in this area!   Laid-back vibe, cool bar, great beer options and very nice staff.   Dave's burger is awesome, it's homemade, fresh, and is made with local ingredients, the fries are pretty great too."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Rotating craft brews, and often on special.  Solid pub food and reasonable prices.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Had heard good reviews of Dave's before but the modest decor left me unsure about it. However, once i had my first bites I became a believer - Dave's burger is definitely one of the best in the city. Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Dave's. I always feel warmly welcomed by staff. The food is not your average bar food - it blows any bar food away! They really put in a lot of attention in the preparation of their food; whether that be a burger, pizza, salmon. Everything I've had to eat here has been delicious.   Try them out, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Better than your average fare food and drink. Service was timely. Too bad the yelp check in discount wasn't working"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for enjoying beer and live music. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Went back to Dave's to give it a second chance after a horrible experience last time.  Once again the servers (2 guys also bar tending) were rude and unfriendly.  They never asked us how our food was or filled our drinks.  I got the burger of the month, when I got the bill it was 15$.  PLUS they charged me to change my fries to salad, and when the salad came it was only lettuce with a few onions on it (the rings they put on burgers)  Overall this place is consistently disappointing.  If these servers are really as miserable and unhappy to be there and they seem, maybe they should seek employment elsewhere?  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our go-to spot when we don't feel like cooking. Kale salad is delicious (we get the dressing on the side) and the margarita pizza is amazing. We've brought lots of family and friends and they've liked everything - the salmon, the mac & cheese, the famous Dave's Burger and the asian wings are stand-outs.   Most of the staff are super friendly too.   Great beer selection in cans, limited taps."}
{"text":"Had a good time here for a friend's birthday. They have some surprisingly wholesome food here - including a great stew. There is an interesting menu so I'll be back to try the rest. I know there are quite a few different special nights here as well. There is a Sunday Stitch & Bitch if you're into that, and there is also a trivia night."}
{"text":"This is a great bar. It's a casual affair and the food is traditional pub fare. If you're looking for some beer and a burger this a a good place. The environment is very laid back and there was a amateur singing event when I was there. Good place to visit if you're looking for some beer and good conversation."}
{"text":"What a great hangout spot. We came here to celebrate with friends and were thoroughly impressed. Great beer selection, great food, great music, great live music, and great decor.  We had the nachos and they were delicious, I appreciated the take on conventional nachos by using a chipotle sauce of some sort on the chips and including feta and marble cheese.  Also the bathrooms were beautiful and really clean. Bathrooms can tell you a lot about a place and this one left me admiring how wonderful this little place was. We will definitely be coming to this place more often.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here for the last day of burger week and it was really busy. I'm a patient guy but I can't stand having to wait for incompetence.   First, I stood at the door for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Servers walked by a couple of times and didn't even bother with \"hi, I'll come help you in a minute\".  While waiting, the line up grew. Not surprising considering how I noticed 3 tables were ready to pay, and 2 tables left uncleared, but no one was getting seated.  Their slowness irked me some more when I overheard a customer ask what was on tap and the server didn't know. She proceeded to walk back and forth twice to the bar. More wasted time.   Finally got seated and my gf didn't like the toppings they featured for burger week. We asked if we could have it dressed like the Dave's Burger and the server immediately shot it down. I didn't deem this an unreasonable request when you consider Burger Week is more than sampling burgers at a decent price; it's about attracting new customers.   To Owners: We were new customers trying you out for the first time and only because Stockyards was too busy. You should have tried to win us over some how. You didn't even try though.  Overall, the food was pretty good. The burger was well seasoned and tasted good. We also ordered nachos and I like how they layered the toppings throughout the nachos and wasn't just piled on top like many other places. I wished the service was better as this place has a lot of potential with the atmosphere and neighbourhood.  Oh well."}
{"text":"This is fantastic. I had a wonderful time. Such personality! Oh the freedom and unencumbered conversations... I can't believe I found such an exception to the norm!  10/10 would patronize again. Left feeling hungry for more, but still not unsatisfied. I think I had just that great of a time.  Hopefully the door is open for me in the near future!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area this week and based on good reviews and craving some good food we decided to check out Dave's.  We sat ourselves and the friendly & chatty waiter came right over talking about specials on beers & food and the open-mike comedy that was going on later that night.  We ordered the Dave's Burger and Chicken ClubHouse.  Both meals came with french fries and it was obvious everything was homemade from the tasty burger to the fresh buns and french fries.  The burger came topped with a homemade 'jam' that was soooo tasty we suggested it be added as a dipping sauce! We will definitely be back even though its not in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Cute spot on St Clair close to my place! There was not a long line up for Sunday brunch. Staff were friendly but looked overworked. Coffee top ups were great!! Omg coffee top ups are essential on a Sunday morning.... hehe. Inside the place was like a regular bar and grill place.  Food came out pretty quickly and good portions with a side of thin potato wedges and fruits! Breakfast nachos came out with three strange bland dips... would have been better w a side of classic sour cream and salsa! The eggs and omelette were good though. I'd come here again for brunch anytime to support this great neighbourhood spot! :)"}
{"text":"Service is good. Although it's always either like trivia or open mic so not good if you wanna talk. Great selection of food and drink. Burger was good but dry. Bun was good. Also it was supposed to have horseradish mayo..... It definitely did not, it barely had any mayo at all. Fries, excellent."}
{"text":"Great pizza and calzone!  Some of the tastiest pizza available in Toronto.  You can tell it is prepared with much care.  Outstanding hot sauce.  Owners are super friendly and make you feel a part of the family.  Apparently there is open-mic music night on Thursdays, however I have not yet gone.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Passed by and was really excited by the menu and the vibe. I stopped in at 6:30 on a Wednesday. I asked for a mac'n cheese, but received a umami burger (which I contemplated getting when the waitress came but switch to mac n cheese). I was also asked to switch tables because I was one person, and there was a party of three waiting to be seated. When I move to the new table I looked to my left and there was a woman sitting alone at a table that sits four people. The burger was lacking flavor, and the fries were under whelming. To be fair she only charged me half price for the burger, and it was a busy night. I will give it another shot in the near future."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Dave's. The first time I hated the burger buns which are made from potato flour and are basically dry and crumble far too easily.   This time I tried the chili and what a difference. It was one of the best chilies I have ever had. Rich, thick, and delicious I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"St Clair has some of the worst bars in Toronto and Dave's is the one of the very few I'd recommend. The cocktails while not amazing are well priced and the atmosphere/service is casual and inviting."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends when I was in the area. This is a charming little pub with a cozy atmosphere. I had the pizza, which was huge and tasty, and there was a pretty good beer list."}
{"text":"Really fantastic staff. Know how to make great classics which is sadly rare at bars. Excellent vibe and intense selection of beers and ciders."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem in this neck of the woods! Super casual and comfortable atmosphere. Not to mention solid beer selection on tap for fair pricing. The owner is very friendly and conversational and creates a very welcoming cheers-ish vibe to the place making you feel like an automatic regular. Great burger and its massive! The toppings were fresh and delicious. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Good place for food and pints. They do fun trivia on Wednesdays with stiff competition. Burgers and Nachos are very good."}
{"text":"When you go to a place called Dave's with your friend Dave and he picks up a book near your table called \"Where's Dave?\" shit gets a bit surreal, but then you're distracted by the rich and delicious mac and cheese with little gnocchi nugget surprises and crispy sage on top with citrusy greens on the side and you start to think that this cozy little neighbourhood spot could easily become your local, as long as you opt for whiskey instead of wine next time."}
{"text":"Dave's on St. Clair serves a mean burger. I mean exceptionally moist, perfectly flavourful and accompanied by awesome fries. We were blown away and will go back."}
{"text":"My experience was, in a word, disappointing.  I recently moved to the area, and wanted to try something new, so I suggested that we try out Dave's for lunch this past Sunday.   I had consulted the menu on the website in advance and everything looked ok. Even prior to walking into the restaurant, it was noted that the menu's were posted on the wall. I received clearance from everyone in my party before entering.   As soon as I opened the door, I noticed that the place was largely empty, which in my books usually raises an eyebrow. We were promptly greeted by the sole waitress in the restaurant and sat at the large table by the window. Rather than being handed the menus that were posted on the wall, we were handed brunch menus that were rather limited in scope. We asked if we could still order off of the lunch menu, and were quickly denied with a swift, 'I'm sorry, but it's only the brunch menu from 11am-3pm\". Out of the 6 items listed, 4 had pork products included. Not being one much for the other white meat it made my choices rather limited. The breakfast pizza ($10) caught my eye, however the menu indicated that included in the toppings was bacon. Things were looking up, when the waitress said that I could order the pizza without the bacon. That was the high point of the meal.  Normally I consider myself to be a pretty easy eater. One thing that truely disgusts me, however, is runny eggs. It was noted that they made an effort to mention on one of the other menu items that the eggs were poached. As a result, when I saw on the menu that there was no mention of the eggs being poached, I automatically assumed that they would be completely fried. Oh how wrong I was. But, being the trooper that I am, I tried to give it a chance. It tasted like I was eating snot. It looked even worse. I tried to keep an open mind and give it a chance. I even tried closing my eyes and imagining that it was something else, however I couldn't get over the barrier.  Now, I must say that the waitress was very nice about it and offered to have something else prepared for me. However, at that point, the rest of my table had pretty much finished their meals, so I wasn't going to order something else and make everyone wait another 30-60 mins. Perhaps I was being too nice, but I did not push to have the bill reduced as I had more than a few bites out of the pizza.  I hate to give restaurants bad reviews because I am aware of the impact that they may have on other people's opinions, however there is no way that I can justify providing anything than one star based on my experience. Given that there are many other places to try in the St. Clair West area, I am not likely to return to Dave's any time soon."}
{"text":"Food is great, awesome beer selection, owner tends to give a bit of attitude and service is just slooooowww"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times now with the Hubster for pub trivia night. Tip for that... COME EARLY. The place isn't very big and it absolutely fills up on Wednesday nights.  The service is very friendly and they have a good, varied menu. I've had the salmon and the burger and both were good. They always have interesting beers.  There's a real local vibe to this place, which I really enjoy. It's an easy 30 min walk from home, so we'll definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I live within walking distance of this bit of strip, and had come down on a Sunday evening to try to get some ribs at the Stockyards. Note to self: 7:45 is not early enough.  Anyways - it had put us in the mood for some simple bad-for-you food, and Dave's was right across the street. The doors and windows were wide open on the mild evening and the atmosphere was actually quite lovely. There is a stack of boardgames (including backgammon, whee!) available which I so love.  The menu is small, but has something for everyone. I narrowed the field very quickly when I noted that the burger had more more notes about cooking temperature than normal or necessary, and ended with the three burger-description words that make my heart skip a beat: ...unless otherwise requested. I have come to understand that in Toronto, where rare ground beef is essentially verbotten, this is your signal. As rare as you want it. So, decision made. I had the Dave's Burger, rare. It had good cheddar and very, very good condiment distribution. It ended up being the second best sit-down restaurant burger I have had in Toronto. I wanted it to go on forever.  The Man had the grilled chicken sandwich, and while it was not moan-inducing, he pronounced it very good. We both had yukon-gold fries, and they were very, very good.  Service was attentive and lovely.  This is a really, really excellent neighbourhood spot for a relaxed dinner, and we will absolutely be back. Consider us charmed."}
{"text":"So happy this place is in my hood.  Good food and great beers with occasional live music.  An oasis in the Desert.  For any mature folk who just want to have some drinks and chill in a cool vibe with some classic rock paraphernalia (think a portrait of Hendrix and an Elvis figurine).   My go to"}
{"text":"I've been to Daves a bunch of times and have hated their food every time I've decided to order something. The atmosphere is good and the beer is good too. I thought a winning quality of Daves was the service but the last time I was in with one other person our server was awful. He wasn't attentive in the least and finally when we had been out of beer for nearly ten minutes we waved him down. That was when his truly winning personality shone through. Note the sarcasm. There's too many awesome places in the area to have rude staff and meh food."}
{"text":"Awesome Decor and music, real friendly staff, and great tasting food. What more could you want. I really enjoyed my first visit to Dave's.   My friend and I sat at the bar and both ordered pints (great selection) and burgers. The burger was fat, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Toppings were nice and fries seemed fresh cut.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Dave's is a friendly place and by far the best \"pub style\" bar on the strip west of Bathurst. Their food is great (especially the burgers and nachos) and I like that they make a lot of it from scratch. I also like their guest tap approach but I'd expand it so they had more on draft and less in the cooler. Bottles are fine but are no substitute for a wider selection of  draft taps.   Dave's is a good place to go for beer, listen to live music and grab some food, especially if you live in the hood. Kid friendly too (toys and books next to the piano)."}
{"text":"$6 Martini Fridays and Trivia Wednesdays! Two great things. This is hands down my neighborhood spot for St Clair West. It has casual charm with cozy decor, good lighting, and a wide selection of local and craft beers along with wine, cocktails, and higher than average quality pub food. The chorizo nachos are good (provided the cheese has been properly layered). The salads and grilled cheese with bacon are also nice and the pizza always looks tasty. The service is great and the owner, Liz, is charming. She also hosts the trivia night. There is also a little sidewalk patio for street gazing."}
{"text":"I'm an American in Toronto and finding a good burger is challenging when you can get them medium at any self respecting restaurant in the states,but the gov has this horrific well done mandate in Canada, yet Dave's still nailed it.  The burger was delicious as were the fries and the drinks, and live music just topped it all off.  I'll be back without question, this place is a win."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat on St Clair West... very small but very good ....  the hamburger was freshly made and the fries are great."}
{"text":"This is a great local hangout with good music good food and friendly owners.  Great selection of beers and the only drawback in my opinion us the lack of high definition TV.  I do recommend it for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Nice local spot that I decided to try out on a whim. Food took a bit long to come out and the waiter forgot to bring out chili flakes for my pizza when I asked for some but everything tasted great so I really can't complain too much. Would definitely come back if the opportunity came up!  I got the sausage rapini pizza. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We wandered over here after we had eaten across the street for a drink on a Friday night. We didn't try any of the food on this visit, just bevvies.  The place itself was pretty busy but we were lucky to find a table. Dave's offers a large selection of craft beers which was perfect for my beer loving fiance. It also seems to be the local joint for lots of neighbourhood peeps. I saw lots of people greeting each other with familiarity.  Fun fact : Dave's has a small shelf with various board games on it. We played a quick game of Trouble while enjoying our drinks.  We enjoyed spending a couple of hours here on a date night and will return again someday soon for another pint!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service. I must've went on the wrong night as there was a party of some sort with a number of kids that were literally running around. I don't mind kids at all because I have two but these kids were a little wild. It's not a big joint so there wasn't any way to ignore the chaos. They were out of Organic Mill Street so I opted for a Caesar...well made but the rim wasn't anything to boast about. Also there was music and it was so loud I felt like I was in a dance club. My boyfriend and I eventually had our food packed and we left earlier than we should have. Despite all of this, I would go back again."}
{"text":"This review is entirely about brunch.  Apparently 'brunch is back' at Dave's, and it's a good thing. Being new-ish to the neighborhood, I didn't realize that brunch had taken a hiatus.   Visited on a bit of a whim on Sunday, and was suitably impressed. All the breakfast dishes are $10, and while the selection isn't vast (5 - 6 options), the ones myself and my partner had were executed quite well.   The omelet let's you customize with 3 ingredients of your choice. I would have preferred 4 or 5, but three is fine. Mine was a touch dry, but was pretty good.  The dish came with home fries the likes of which I hadn't had in the city before - deep fried and crispy, much closer to a potato wedge chip than other home fries.   As well, the dish came with a slice of toast that could only be better described as having a grilled-cheese feel to it ... a welcome surprise.   And fruit - can't forget the few pieces of pineapple, orange slice, grapes and some strawberry.  For $10, can't get much better than this.  My partner had poached eggs, which came on a bed of spinich and on top of a potato-type English muffin. Was good, but hard to describe/recall.   Not to mention, there wasn't a crowd (maybe 10 other people in the space), the tables were nicely spaced, and the background noise of a British soccer game was quite soothing.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Dave's used to be my local favourite.  Tonight it was painfully mediocre.  I suppose it's our fault for not properly reading the menu.  My wife didn't realise that there was going to be beef on her poutine, i didn't realise that the classic burger, reported to have been cooked to 160f, would have actually been so overcooked it was the consistency of uncured concrete.  Or that it would be shaped like a meatball half the size of the bun it was sitting on.  I understand why it came with ketchup, I can't stand the stuff but if I did, it would have covered up the chalky dryness."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning with a group of 9. Was one of the only places that would take a reservation. I was expecting a sports bar pub but was pleasantly surprised that it was not. They had board games and mismatched tables and a cute bar area to sit at as well. Menu was varied but simple and the food looked and tasted delicious. Staff was friendly. Food took a bit but it's a small place and we were a big group - so understandable."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Dave's in over a year and unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the poutine and it was so oily I didn't finish it even though I was hungry. My husband had the burger and he said it was dry and over cooked. I won't be going back to Dave's any time soon."}
{"text":"I think perhaps people talked this place up to me too much when I moved to this neighbourhood...my expectations were HIGH! \"The best burger in the city\" friends told me. That..was a bold and false statement.   The burgers are dry...taste like frozen ones...the buns..oh lord the buns are so dry that no amount of condiments could save them. So sad...I really wanted to like them.  The 3 starts are for the fries, the beer selection and the so so service. The fries I will go back for anytime...in fact...they need to make a poutine out of these fires..for real Dave's..poutine the hell out of those fries and you will have a best seller!"}
{"text":"Down the street from Emma's, this is a decent alternative to a 90 minute wait. We found ourselves here on the Sunday of a holiday weekend. It's an eclectic neighborhood bar. Board games, piano, guitar, old school bar at the back. Perhaps dated, but it works. Service is fast and friendly. At noon you can order breakfast or lunch.  We ended up with: Omelette Breakfast nachos Lunch nachos I would say the omelette was the standout with crispy potato wedges, bright fruit salad and delicious bread with yummy strawberry jam. The others were bar nachos and if you like nachos then you should order these.  Solid 3.5, rounded up to 4 on service."}
{"text":"You like board games?  But like... old ones.  Like ones you knew about in the 1990s, not this post-Catan nonsense.  Good.  You're part way to Dave's already.  You like playing piano or guitar to show how great you are to your friends?  You've taken another step.  Do you like sitting inside, or on a super cramped patio?  Awesome possum.  It's a pretty good place.  It's not overly expensive.  I would not hate going back again.  It's a little bit of hip, in an area without much of that."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Dave's on a number of occasions and the pizza has always been excellent.  It is what we would consider to be traditional pizzeria pizza.  If you are looking for thin crust, upscale bistro pizza, this may not be the place to look.  However, that being said, Dave's pizza is excellent.  Tonight was the first time I had been in the restaurant.  Thus, I ordered the calzone for the first time.  I had the deluxe.  When it first arrived, I found it to be quite large.  Now, that's not a criticism per se, but it's no pizza pocket.  You also receive an excellent tomato sauce on the side to pour over your calzone as you wish to do so.  Wish to do so.  The sauce was a great addition to an already good meal.  The dough for the calzone was quite good, but it was the stuffings that really made it great.  They were fresh and flavourful and abundant.  All good thing.    Now, if you like hot sauce, you are in luck.  Dave's makes its own sauce.  It is not the hottest, but it has great flavour and kick, and is, to my liking, more chunky than runny.    The service was great and the atmosphere was what you would expect from a pizza shop.  It is clean and comfortable, but not chic.  I rather liked the checked table cloths.  The whole feel is pretty straightforward.  It is the food that shines best.  Dave's is yet another reason to love the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We used to live in the area and went to Dave's on a regular basis. We had not been back for a couple of years. We decided to have a pre Christmas party with about 9 friends while we were back in town.   My wife and I had dinner before everyone arrived and it was a mess. We ordered medium rare hamburgers - one with fries and one with salad. We received 2 well done hamburgers both with fries. I ordered a second vodka and soda but a rye and ginger arrived. And so it went for the night having to go to the bar to get the waiter, asking for extra napkins, water jugs, etc.   There was only one male bartender/waiter on when we arrived at 630pm on a Monday night and the place was about half full.   To make a long story short: the service was abysmal resulting in me asking the waiter if this was his actual job. He said yes and that he had been doing it for years. Never saw him smile or apologize for all of the errors during the evening and there were so many we sort of gave up. The food was mediocre at best.   I was going to leave no tip but instead I asked the waiter what he felt he should be tipped considering all the problems we had. He was shocked that we had had such a bad experience. Wow. We left 15% as he requested. Shrug.   My feeling is that this is a great place for locals as the wait staff spent a lot of time tending to the group at the bar who seemed to all know each other.   Rating: won't be back.   Advice: get the wait staff some customer service training or more wait staff."}
{"text":"Love coming here, Liz and Sarah are the best. Try the signature Dave's Caesar. I'm addicted to them!  They have a huge collection of craft beers as well."}
{"text":"I have been eager to try Dave's for months. My first attempt at getting a table at Thursday's open mic night failed --it was packed by 9pm. This Thursday however, arriving at 8:30, we were able to snag the big table by the window.   It's so busy, I was expecting big things!  The service was great, especially considering how busy it was. But the limited food we ordered was very disappointing. The French onion soup had no flavour, very little cheese and the \"garlic bread\" it was listed to come with was actually croutons in the soup. The hummus was thick and not well-blended on the veggie hummus plate.  The Guinness pour was the second best I have had in Toronto, at a very reasonable $7 including tax. It was a good sign when our server brought over everyone else's drinks and had to go back to get the slowly poured Guinness!  The open mic night is wonderful. The house band is so great and everyone else who performed, including a guy on his first night, were crowd-pleasing and talented.   I will definitely return and maybe try the poutine next time..."}
{"text":"For a restaurant with the words \"gourmet\" and \"pizza\" in its name, Dave's is thoroughly disappointing. The two pizzas and small order of tantalizingly named \"tequila barbecue\" flavoured wings we had could only be described as bland and tasteless. The butternut squash and black bean soup was reported to be good.  There was a large selection of beer. Drinks and refills came quickly. The servers were friendly and very quickly turned over a long table for us when we arrived to find all of the tables filled. The look and feel of Dave's is right for a casual weekday gathering of friends, but without good food, there is hardly any point in us going back."}
{"text":"Fun, friendly and reasonably priced.   Burgers, any of them, are tasty.  Beer on tap is clean and I've never had a problem.  The servers try their best when it is ridiculous busy hour but take the time to chat with you.   When it isn't so busy, this place is a good place to have lunch, drink a beer and read.   High five, Dave."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night to partake in what I like to call a \"no-consent buffet dinner.\" Everyone's meals were delicious!   My friend had a warm kale salad with portobellos and..parmigiano? A sharp dry cheese peeled on top. Delicious'n'nutritious if a bit too much balsamic at the end. Liked the crispy bits of kale throughout - piety with variety!  The fries, which I took home and am still nibbling, were hand-cut, golden-brown spears of satisfaction. I am enjoying them even in soggy coldness.   My 2nd friend's club sandwich was *huge*, same delicious fries and nice crispy bacon. The club is an art of harmony, achieved well here.   My overwhelming enthusiasm over this place, though, is painted most thickly in the gravy, mashed potatoes, nice roasted garlic cloves and thyme roast half chicken I split with the 3rd friend.  If I were some kind of developmentally arrested comfort fiend delighted by a combination of adult bar-time and childhood mama-made-dinner eating, I would probably go here every Sunday.   (See you next Sunday.)"}
{"text":"Not good for groups of 6+. It's too small of a place with slow service. Gratuity of 15% automatically included, which is okay IF the service is decent. We waited about 40 minutes to get our bill and another 15 to pay for it. I had to get our server's attention both times.  The moment we came in, they seemed too preoccupied to give us a table. While we were waiting for drinks I saw someone sit at a table, wait for 10-15 minutes, and eventually leave because he was never served.  The food was okay. Not bad but not great. I got the burger of the month. It was a bit dry and didn't have a lot of flavour. The fries were good. The calamari was a bit rubbery. My friend's nachos were definitely burnt at the top and greasy at the bottom. Another friend liked her wings.  The service is where this place definitely lacked. I had the following interaction with the server: Me: I'll have the Tom Green beer Server: Do you even like stout? Me: I like beer so I'm sure I'll like it Server: Are you sure it's a lot of beer Me: Yeah I'll get it Server: Do you like Guiness Me: Not really Server: So you're not getting that  (starts talking to someone else and completely disregards me)  I wanted a beer. It's fair that she suggested against a beer I probably wouldn't like, but she didn't offer an alternative so I was without a beer the whole time here. Oh well I loaded up on beer after I left at another place."}
{"text":"I group of us went here on an early Sunday afternoon.  The place was not busy, the staff was friendly and attentive, and they have a really good selection of beer.    The Mac and cheese was bubbling, and brunch was on ('til 4pm).  I ordered the Dave's burger.  It came out well done, served on a potato bun (nice!).  Slight let down as there was very little of the garlic aioli or tomato onion jam to add to the flavour profile of the burger."}
{"text":"Had take out/pick up from here. Service was great when we went to pick up. As far as the food goes- For pub food it was good.   The Dave's Burger and the mashed potatoes that came with the salmon were the highlights of our meal. The wings were spicier than expected, yet A bit on the soggy side but it doesn't help that we did take out. I'd recommend staying with the 'greasier' more traditional pub fare (I.e. instead of the salmon which was just OK) but we will definitely go in and eat (and drink!) here again."}
{"text":"Great menu! I sure did enjoy the burger I had (uploaded a pic). The deco was cool (even in the bathroom). And the staff there were so friendly! I'll def. be back with my friends again!"}
{"text":"I really love Dave's, I do. My wife and I have been going regularly since we moved into the neighbourhood. The food is great, and the beer selection is top notch!   What really kept us coming was the staff. We had only gone a handful of times but they remembered who we were and what our drink of choice was.   The Thursday night open mic is also worth catching, although it's a little cramped. Other nights are quieter and laid back, so if you're looking for a place to bring a small group last minute, try Dave's!"}
