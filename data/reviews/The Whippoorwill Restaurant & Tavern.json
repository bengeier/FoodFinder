{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the food, but it's nothing to write home about, either, and the prices are very steep for what you get ($12.50 for pancakes).  I much preferred the menu (and prices) of the Bloordale Pantry.  This place also definitely needs more vegan options.  One good thing is that it's pretty kid friendly, if that's your bag (although I do not think they had a kid's menu)."}
{"text":"I find the Whippoorwill menu a little odd and have had a hard time convincing friends to come-with. Finally a brave friend agreed to join me and we went for an early dinner last night. Our server was lovely and the service was very good. She explained everything about the menu. She also recommended the number of dishes we should order which also seemed a little odd but no worries.  They have a good selection of beers. I didn't really check out the wine but they have a new wine list.  My friend had chicken wings and I had gnocchi. We shared the shaved veg salad. We both had the lemon pavlova for dessert.   The salad was nice and crisp with lots of flavour. My friend really enjoyed her chicken wings including the fantabulous sculptural presentation.   The gnocchi was nice and I liked that they were fried and a bit crispy. The sauce was a bit thick maybe but it sits under the gnocchi so you can choose how much sauce you want to eat and I liked that. This dish is quite oniony. It is a little like a cross between gnocchi and perogies :) In a good way.  The pavlova is HUGE and very sweet (of course). It was nice and lemony. I couldn't finish mine.  The food here is good. Not AMAZING but good.   We arrived quite early and it was quiet when we got there. There were quite a few little kids eating there. They like the meatballs on toast.  It got quite lively while we were there and there seemed to be a bit of a neighbourhood bar vibe happening. It is a fun place."}
{"text":"Always great food and good service. I love their creative specials. Yum! The servers have a great sense of humour and I always leave smiling and satisfied."}
{"text":"The food, drinks and service here are all fantastic. My husband and I have been back many times. They have some awesome specials, but the menu is small and we wish they would change it more regularly. Oysters here are good and cheap, head here after work! Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"After seeing some drool-worthy photos of the Whippoorwill's brunch on Twitter and Instagram, I had to make it my next brunch destination. The power of social media, eh?   And... I'm happy to report, it lived up to my expectations. 4.5 stars!  What Jess ate:  Whippoorwill Burger - ground prime beef, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing on a buttered bun ($14). Voted the \"Best Burger over $10\" (Now Magazine) and well deserved! The juicy patty was cooked to a nice medium rare, the cheese was perfectly melted and the Russian dressing packed a nice punch. The burger was served with a ridiculously good side of fries. Extra crispy, just the way I like 'em.  Poached Eggs - on a buttermilk biscuit with fried Brussels sprouts, house smoked maple bacon and chive & brown butter hollandaise ($14). Perfectly poached eggs, moist & fluffy biscuits, flavourful hollandaise... and the killer brussels sprouts.   Apple Pancakes - with maple syrup, glazed apples, walnut crumble and cinnamon cream ($13). While just a touch denser than what I prefer, they were still pretty damn good. I loved the classic combination of the apples, cinnamon and maple.   I was impressed with what they had to offer for brunch. Next time: dinner!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes that this restaurant replacing Bloordale Pantry would pull up its socks and tighten its belt, but the opposite happened.  Granted, they're still in their first few weeks, but details matter.  - Dirty coffee cups: old residue from previous customers likely hot washed (even on the replacement cup), but not scrubbed since the Dale years. - Eggs drenched in olive oil (which made the potatoes and bacon also taste like olive oil) - Large, and extremely starchy potatoes - these 'crispy' potatoes would be much better served in smaller bites - Hot water and a tea bag served after the food, but first on the order - $2 substitution from potatoes to regular salad - 20% default tip prompt when paying the bill  Don't get me wrong, the BLT was a lovely buttery crunchy fatty delicious sandwich, even at a steep $12.50.   The service, as it was with Bloordale, is always pretty great - with big smiles and quick response. And now, the atmosphere is more comfortable with the better bar and decor.  However, as a Bloor/Lansdowne resident, I'm sad that I can't love this place. Things that would make me love you, Whippoorwill:  * FRUIT * LOSE THE $1 Tea vs. $2 Herbal Tea Price - what's up with that?  Set TEA at $1.50 - the difference in price of your PC Tea bags are unnecessary.  * Don't cook eggs in olive oil.  Use butter, for the love of god. * Flexible options - potatoes for salad brings happiness. * FRUIT"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and ended up arriving 20 minutes earlier than the rest of the party. Instead of enduring a painfully awkward wait for them, the staff came over to chat until they arrived. Super friendly people work here, very helpful and even suggested some different dishes for us to try.  Food: I had the risotto. It was a special that night and it was amazing. Definitely one of the best risottos i've ever had.  Had the butterscotch pudding for dessert. Amazing. It had homemade butterscotch and whipped cream with toffee bits in a cute jar.  Definitely not my last time going here. Next time I'll try their famous burger!"}
{"text":"We've been a bunch of times, they never disappoint. Great spot for brunch and also dinner. I love that the menu changes seasonally as well. Service is always top notch and very attentive. Highly recommend their burgers!"}
{"text":"This is a brunch fave in our house! We love it here. The brunch is really great and everything on the menu is great. The pan seared tuna rocks, the specials are always a delight, and the burger is solid ( although it seems like they changed the bun about 6 months ago and it's much more greasy ). The service is nice, fun and unpretentious. (Some times the drink service is slow). I will say we had a bachelorette party here for dinner and the servers were amazing. The service was great for such a large group. Everyone loved their meals. Great local joint !"}
{"text":"Wow this place is incredible. I'm pretty sure anything you get here is amazing. I went here last night with a few friends and we were definitely not expecting anything like this.   I started with the oysters, which I'm usually not keen on. Holy Sh**. I could not stop ordering the oysters. The ginger sauce it comes with is the perfect splash of sweet vinegary goodness, and the hot sauce is out of this world for reals. I also had the curried egg salad sandwich which they had on special, it was great too. My vegetarian friend was happy here as they do have good veggie options which have \"very very good flavours\" as she said. My other friends got the fish and duck confit, which they were very very happy with. I'm pretty sure we sat with our eyes closed half the time as we were savouring each bite of everything.  The drinks... I'm starting to run out of adjectives. Best cocktail I've ever had in my life. The Pickup Artist is a must try. Truly a well crafted piece of art. My friends had the whiskey sour and old fashioned which were also made with soul.  And finally, the staff. Very knowledgeable, super helpful and kind. Really just adds another layer to the whole experience.   I should mention the place itself has a nice rustic cozy feel to it, with totally on point music.  I will absolutely be coming back here, and I absolutely recommend that you check this place out. Don't have any doubts, stop thinking about it and just go!"}
{"text":"Burger is top notch, it's the payment options that I have an issue with. They no longer take credit cards or debit but only accept cash, \"Tab\" and \"Paypal\". For most people cash is the only option. I doubt I'll be eating here again. Good luck Whippoorwills!"}
{"text":"Our brunch was quite good today. The service is very friendly and helpful Food came in an ok amount of time and was pretty good. Not my first choice for brunch as I don't find there to be enough on the menus to entice me but it is still a decent meal. I usually just get the two egg breakfast with link sausage. I do really love there hot sauce and jam which I believe they make on site."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the bar.    I usually lap up the cocktails, and the bar was lined with so many different kinds of bitters and homemade bottles of infused weirdness that I was really excited.  But I thought the cocktail menu was too arrogant and rococo: no classics, nothing that was a recognizable riff on a classic, everything with 4-6 weird ingredients that make it impossible to figure out what it will taste like, and the cocktails clock in at $12-$14 which made me unwilling to take a chance.  So I didn't actually try the cocktails and I can't tell you if they are any good.  I didn't get the feeling that the bartender was a kindred spirit and couldn't bring myself to support such disrespect for tradition.  Suggestion: offer cocktail flights.  I don't really know if I want to spend $14 to try an imaginary cocktail with fig syrup, green chartreuse, oregano, and jalapeno bitters, but I might be willing to spend $15 to taste 3 of them.  Now that I'm hyperventilating about disrespecting tradition, I thought the Korean Ribs were a failure and they should stop trying to do Asian food. The Korean Ribs are basically galbi with no soul.  When I eat galbi I expect to be (a) drunk, (b) choking on clouds of garlicky smoke from the grill built into the table, and (c) eating rice and 26 different kinds of banchan.  You, Mr. Korean Ribs, are no galbi.    The braised duck leg (aka duck confit) was pretty good.  The carrots and chard and onions and yam mash were yummy and I cleaned my plate.  The shaved apple salad was also not bad.  We also tried the icebox cake and, once we got past the fact that it wasn't a big wad of chocolate cookies and cool whip (more disrespect for tradition!), really really liked it.  So Whippoorwill is not a bad place, but I think it would be better if they stopped trying to show how smart they are."}
{"text":"Headed to the Whippoorwill straight after work in time to catch happy hour which was a great start.  I had the shaved winter veg salad which was light and delicious, hubby had the Castro Verde soup-hearty beef and kale soup which he devoured gleefully despite the fact he thought he didn't like Kale!  Moved on from the pints of Duggans to a nice light gl of Pinot Noir to accompany an out of this world gnocchi with fried mushrooms.   Gnocchi was smooth and creamy on the inside and beautiful, slightly crispy, outer.  My husband had the house made sausage which he said had an almost pâté texture, came with sauerkraut  and sautéed veggies.  Most enjoyable cozy dining experience I've had in ages.  I already want to go back.  Low key, delicious and   warm, knowledgeable servers.  You can't really go wrong here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to whippoorwill last night for dinner as I was interested in checking it out. I'm really torn about what I think about this place. Being a long weekend the place was only 1/3rd full so walking in at 8:30pm we were sat immediately and had a couple cocktails to start - pretty pedestrian, nothing to write home about but they were tasty, though a little pricey at $14 each. Had some PEI oysters to start, fresh and clean - good  mignonette. My boyfriend had the burger, which was delicious and came with some homey steak fries, I had one of the daily specials - the halibut crudo. The way the server described it, it sounded like it came with a side salad - it did not. What arrived in front of me was a surprisingly pretentious looking plate of well, crudo. I was shocked  that this was supposed to be an entree - it would have been much better described as an appetizer as it was so small. Very strange. On the positive side - the fish was very fresh and delicious, I just would have never ordered it as a main - was a little annoyed that I was so misinformed about the dish.   Service was decent but it took quite a while to get the bill, which again, was surprising because it wasn't busy! I think the bartender overheard my grumbles and swiftly brought it over afterwards.   I might be back to try their brunch, but they didn't really sell me on coming back for dinner. The Emerson is a much better bet in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Hands down, best burger in the city. On top of that the staff are wonderful, specials are always top notch and cocktails are not to be missed.  Also brunch here is great. That BLT tho."}
{"text":"Really bad brunch experience there today. The service was the worst part, rude, slow, confrontational. Took forever to get coffee and water refills. We had to wait a very long time to place our orders, and they took a very long time to get the food out to us. Food was average, but certainly not worth the price. When we left we were not acknowledged or thanked by any of the staff members. The place was busy, but there were more than enough people working (standing around, chatting to each other at the bar) that should have prevented such poor service. I'm not one to overly complain about these things, but this really put me off to the point where I signed up for an account to post this.   You can find better ways to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"The menu ...something is wrong with the current dinner menu. It does not make sense. Was very disappointed considering brunch is a complete knock out. Dinner menu comes across as a forced selection of very odd choices. Extremely annoying how mains do not come with side vegetable or salad. Side choices were odder than the menu and I am an adventurous eater. Perhaps it was me, dinner menu is on the web so give it a look before you go. I am sure what they make is great, this is not a comment on the quality but on the menu itself.  Server was excellent as always."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriend here based on pictures I had seen on Instagram (isn't social media awesome at times?) and was not disappointed. The bar manager was charming, honest and gave us great advice on what to order. We had a delicious malbec (I think it was Crios) then had a couple of appetizers. Both the beet salad and gnocchi were flavorful and serving sizes were spot on. Only regret is that I did not order the burger. It looked wonderful. I will save that for next time."}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing. Food is delicious. If price isn't a worry for you then you must go. It's a bit on the pricier side if you're planning to drink but if you're just going for a meal and don't mind the bar-atmosphere then it's a must-try. Really yummy, seasonal options and they're open for brunch on the weekends! Go!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Whippoorwill several times as I live in the area, and I have been VERY satisfied with the experience each and every visit.  The food is delicious and the service top-shelf.  The room is comfortable/cozy, the staff knowledgable, friendly and attentive.  They play great music and the bartender makes fabulous beverages!   Do not hesitate to visit this The Whippoorwill.  Bring your friends along, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was hoping Whippoorwill would be better than it was.  This is a typical hipster spot that is apparently known for having a great burger but I found it average at best.  The meat was relatively bland and the potato wedges on the side were just boring.  The food looks great when plated and seems to encompass a tasty mix of ingredients but just didn't deliver on taste for some reason.  I've also ate off one of the brunch dishes (eggs, bacon, beans) and again found it average at best.  Overall, Whipporwill was just ok and not somewhere one should go out of their way for."}
{"text":"Before the summer months came along, I visited The Whip for dinner and drinks for a friends birthday celebrations. It was just two couples so it was the perfect sized outing for this small diner style location (larger groups beware you may have difficulty getting in here).   Ever have that situation where everything on the bar and food menu's looks fantastic and your brain overloads and you end up going with a safe bet. Ya that happened. Everything here sounded INCREDIBLE, like amazing enough to make me want to come back on the regular.   I looked over the drink menu and being an Old Fashioned guy myself, it was a no brainer for me when I saw their take on an OF done with a super peaty scotch. It was all my favourite things in one glass. I mean if you love a good OF or if you love a peaty scotch.... or both, you'd be remiss to not order this drink at least 5 times in a row (prices be dammed this is what would happen if you put Don Draper and Ron Burgundy in a room together and told them to come up with a cocktail. The only way to make this manlier would be to have this served in a bearded glass covered in spikes and leather. That's simply not possible so this drink is already the most manliest you can drink.  I couldn't decide on a meal so I took a quick scoot onto the interwebs and I discovered that they had an award winning burger! I don't care what your burger is or who gave you the award, you put award winning on it and I'm all in like it's head to head at the WPT finals.  The burger while slightly smaller in size made up with big bold flavours, a perfect medium rare cook, juicyness running down my fingers into my palms and UGHHH I think I just wet myself.....  Go hear... right now. Order all the burgers and food and down it with a peaty scotchy old fashioned-y drink-y-y-y!  Eatcrest Out-y!"}
{"text":"This place deserves to be my first review. The interior design is unique but welcoming. I was impressed from the moment I walked in. It's like that episode from lost when the group climb down the hatch and meet Desmond for the first time. You don't know what's going to happen, but you know it's going to be cool.   Moving on to the most important part of any restaurant reviews: the food.   I'm not even going to bother with other dishes. Don't get me wrong, the artichoke and the deep fried chicken thigh with spicy sauce were tasty. But, the burger. Oh man, the BURGER. This burger is probably one of the best I've had in the city. It's hard to describe the flavour. If I had to, it's like that lost episode when you find out what the \"numbers\" really mean. Yes, this burger may lead to your very own moment of clarity. The soft buns, the thick juicy patty, and the toppings come together perfectly. The Whippoorwill burger isn't just good food, it's an EXPERIENCE.  I'm probably not making much sense anymore, but that's okay. Go try this burger."}
{"text":"Okay.. How cool is the Whip?  I really loved the great vibe there, the live music on Thursday nights (could be other nights of the week but that's the night I was there!) and the service was exceptional.   I always love when I can walk into a bar and feel immediately embraced like a warm hug. It's cozy and comfy and you can really hunker down and get your drink on here.  They have some incredible signature drinks. I tried a bourbon one and really enjoyed it. (Sorry I cannot recall the name for the life of me). I cannot wait to try the food here.  I loved this place so much I tried to get Justin Timberlake to stop by via twitter.. Needless to say, I failed.. But had he come, I believe he'd be writing a similar review on how aces this place is."}
{"text":"Their burgers are amazing! Also their whiskey sours are made proper (with an egg). Staff are great!"}
{"text":"Dinner with the family (7 adults + 1 5 year old), December 27, 2013. We really enjoyed it! Became a share-fest between all of us. Tried & really enjoyed: Korean Ribs, Potato Gnocchi, Pork Meatballs on Toast, Beet Salad and all three desserts. Personally did not try (but heard raves from the table): Apple Salad, Oysters, Whipporwill Burger, Pickerel, Duck Leg, Mussels.  I would have liked to try the cocktails, but the price ($12) scared me off a little (father in law was paying & I was sitting next to him).  Service was very good, especially with a little girl getting pretty antsy by the end.  Would recommend. Would go back again."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a good burger and found this place listed on a top 10 burgers in T.O. blog - it certainly satisfied the craving! The service was great and so were the cocktails (try the Dorian Grey!). It's a small place so definitely suggest making a reservation. We were too full for dessert but they sent us home with some delicious honey & cinnamon Popcorn on the house!"}
{"text":"I'm a little puzzled about the link between the name Whippoorwill and the 50s era garage stylings of the space. And the deer on the wall. And the radio that delivers draft beer. The usually helpful google offers no inspiration.   (Is the owner's name Will? is someone whipping poor will? Is will poor?)  Whippoorwill is lovely. I was a fan of the Bloordale pantry and I remember there were some that lamented its upgrading of the local restaurant scene. I'm sure those people  are even more dismayed by the cloth napkins and wine bottles in view now.  They should be pleased, however, by the yummy  breakfasts coming from the kitchen, the pleasant atmosphere and - a nice surprise - the consistent presence of some of the former staff at the Bloordale. Bottles of water on the table and good, old-fashioned, don't-need-to-make-a-big-deal-about-it cups of coffee are also welcome reminders of the charms of the previous restaurant. I've only visited once so I don't know yet if Whipporwill will distinguish itself in some way aside from the change in decor. I'm just glad that there's still a great place to grab a late breakfast at Bloor and Lansdowne."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on Tuesday. Had Mill Street, Oysters and the meatballs, glad the meatballs were half price as there were only two (Albeit large ones). Also there was some confusion with the oysters, we ordered 2 but got 6. O well, they were decent and quite fresh with a nice dressing."}
{"text":"I had the burger week special here.  Walked in early, around 5:30 because I knew we were just going to have the burger and didn't want to interrupt the dinner service.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full and we were seated immediately.  The burger special was a top butt and brisket, steamed white cheddar, sweet sandwich mustard, garlic pickle relish, and ballpark garnishes.  This was probably the best burger I've had during burger week.  I also scanned the menu and the choices seem great.  The restaurant has a cool retro feel to it, and we were seated right beside an antique meat scale.  The service was OK.  There was only one waitress serving maybe 5-6 tables.  She looked a bit overwhelmed.  My burger simply came wrapped in paper, which was fine and I made quick work of it, but it took a while to get her attention again as the restaurant progressively became busier.  Based on the burger alone and looking at the menu, I'd definitely return for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"If you ever get the urge to sip on Christmas in a fucking glass to the smooth sounds of Smokey Robinson then head to Whippoorwill ASAP for the Irish Santa cocktail, which includes a tiny porcelain pitcher filled with Jameson and gingerbread liqueur accompanied by a highball glass of ice cubes and a cup of cherrywood smoke (as if!) wrapped like a present in red tissue and a blue ribbon and you open the package and it smells like a crackling fire at your grandparent's farm on the outskirts of Red Deer, Alberta, and you pour in the booze, add a couple ice cubes and take a few sips while you recall a time at a bar in Vancouver when you ordered a drink that came with a polaroid photo of yourself drinking it except this one actually tastes good and you can't help but notice a patron across the room yell-talking about how Joel got really fat after he stopped being a vegan straightedge (duh) and you can't tell if he's been playing in the quote unquote snow or if he was just born insufferable but your current yuletide buzz helps you get through it while at the same time encouraging you to do questionable things like snap a quick pic of the young gentleman at the bar's impeccable shoe and sock ensemble."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is completely unpretentious, and the food isn't half bad.   We didn't have a reservation but they managed to fit us in. When a \"better\" table freed up before we ordered, they even offered to move us there. My dining partner's drink was called \"A Trip to the Market\", and featured gin with persimmon and some other tasty ingredients. He suggested, however, that the next time they visit the market, they might want to pick up a sprig of basil or mint to take the drink to the next level.  I started with the \"Simple Green Salad\", which was delightful, with what I think were pickled radishes and sun dried tomato. The vinaigrette was truly what made the dish, though. I know what you're thinking. Really? Of all the tasty sounding options, you started with a salad? Yes, I did. It takes some TLC to keep my figure this svelte.  Keeping in mind that I'm watching my weight, the obvious next step was to order the cornbread with pork belly. It came in a piping hot skillet and was garnished with green onion and prunes. The pork belly could have been a bit fattier/crispier, but overall, it was a pretty solid dish. My boyfriend ordered the Korean style chicken wings, which blew us both away.   All in all, it was a fairly solid evening and a pleasant experience. I get the feeling that some dishes are better honed than others, however, and there's room for considerable improvement. I'd go back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Went to Whippoorwill tonight for dinner and drinks and was very impressed. The staff was friendly and helpful. I ordered the Fried Chicken Thighs and a side of Parmesan and olive oil potatoes. My friends ordered the meatballs and toast and the whippoorwill burger. I really enjoyed my chicken, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was cooked to perfection. My friends weren't as impressed with their meals but my review is mostly for the chicken.   I ordered a pint of MacKinnon English Pale Ale which was also very good.   I would definitely go back to the Whippoorwill."}
{"text":"They can do the burger medium rare, albeit theme felt cold eating it : ( And they have a nice cozy space and incredibly attentive service from the waitresses.. sometimes not the couple male staff I encountered. Cute place, good food, ok price. But not special enough to return/ go out of my way for. I think if I lived in the neighbourhood it would easily be 3.5-4 stars."}
{"text":"(DINNER review only) Friendly service, fair prices, delicious food -- roast cauliflower, gnocchi and butterscotch pudding were highlights.  Glad to have a place like this for dinner in the area. (Zocalo's great too!)  Have been here for three dinners and very consistent each time--so five stars!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I know I can pick anything off the menu and it's going to be a brand new experience. Good specials too and the oysters during happy hour... I love the music, the staff, the late night burgers! My only complaint is they no longer accept credit cards so it's either cash, or ... PayPal? Anyways bring some cash and let the chef blow your mind!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!!!  On my last weekend before moving out of the neighbourhood I decided to finally give 'The Whip' a try. I knew I was going to order the famous burger before I even sat down and was happy I did...worth a visit! Quick tip: ask for extra napkins!! Service was casual and attentive. Interior was pretty neat. Only lost half a star because the potato wedges could have a bit more personality (and salt) in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food and service were wonderful. My only complaint..cash only..not even debit. And impossible to know that coming in.   Now I am back to asking every restaurant I enter if I should bring seashells for currency. I get it it, helps keep costs down..but it should be on the menu or really obvious signage.   By all means go...loved the food...but ya have to drop by your bank ahead of time."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best food I have had in Toronto.  I find myself coming back here more and more.  The burger is wonderful, and that maple syrup griddle cake thing?  Delicious."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious. I have no idea why I doubted it in the first but I was extremely impressed with the service, quality of food and selection. It's not overly priced either. The only reason why I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they don't accept debit (who doesn't accept debit!) and they have an ATM that charges a $2.50 service fee - not cool."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the staff were just wonderful. Servers are knowledgeable, bartenders are friendly, and they went out of their way to hang our coats (bonus points). The wine list is nice (many surprisingly tasty Ontario selections by the glass) and the cocktail list looked interesting.  I was really hoping to have at least a 4-star experience here given the publicity about Whippoorwill and its rating as Toronto's Best New Restaurant by Now Magazine. Unfortunately, it just missed the mark. The beets in the beet salad appetizer were kind of wrinkly. That's really the best word I can come up with to describe the sensation in my mouth - something was off about them. The spicy wings were juicy and delicious BUT very difficult to eat because they were so large and the forearm part of the wing was still connected to the upper arm of the wing. Know what I mean? Finally, we had originally ordered the gnocchi but were told that the portion was probably \"too small\" to share as a main dish (with the wings) so we were recommended an alternate dish: the ribs. The ribs were the most disappointing part of the meal: they were dry and gamey and looked more like pork chops than ribs.   So although I loved the people here and although the ambiance was great (dimly lit, cozy, etc.), I can't justify 4 stars because the food simply wasn't great."}
{"text":"The hype is real, the hamburger is great. Definitely in my top 10. Just do yourself a favour and pay the $2.50 to add the bacon, it's thick cut and will really round out the burgers flavours nicely.  Instead of the standard french fries, it comes with a side of potato wedges which were pretty tasty too, if even just for being somewhat unique.  They have 4 beers on tap, but added cool factors for the fact that their beer taps are built into a repurposed vintage radio. I didn't realize this at the time, but apparently they offer $5 pints from 5-7 Tuesday through Friday. Even better, on Wednesdays you can a burger and a beer for $16.   Friendly staff worth a shout out as well. This place is solid."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night dinner and was totally wowed. Had a very simple dinner, green salad and the mulligatawny soup and everything was just gorgeous. Something about the lettuce was just so special, the baby romaine was so crisp, as if someone had grew it in their garden and picked it that afternoon. Then the soup -which was completely vegan, was a little bit sweet and a little bit spicy and just so warming and lovely. My boyfriend had the burger and I don't think it ever hit the plate after he picked it up, he completely devoured it in a second, and the potato wedges we're hands down the best I've ever had.  The service was a little silly, the table was kinda minuscule, and honestly they'd benefit from front of house staff caring as much as the kitchen because the food was astounding."}
{"text":"One of the top burgers in Toronto. Medium rare, as it should be. A buttery bun that holds up. What makes the burger stand out is the pickles. It's the tiniest bit on the small side.  The pasta was delicious. A good amount of sauce for the medium large plate of pasta. But pricey for what it is.  Personally the cocktails are not for me.  Attentive, eccentric service. They don't miss a beat."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall + Super Friendly staff  = tons o' fun.   Great drink recommendations.   I had the cold chicken pho when it was on special - so their kitchen is as solid as their bar."}
{"text":"4 star for food, 3 star for atmosphere, 3 star for price the food was actually really good. The burger was juicy, the cauliflower was spiced well, and the meatball toast was tasty. However, the prices are a bit steep for the smallish portions. The lighting was really off when we went in for dinner and the walls were quite bare. Even before we ate we were feeling a bit nauseous because of the way the lights were. However, i think it would be much better in the daytime and maybe also if they didn't have their christmas lights blinking on and off all time.  I would come back for the food, and hopefully the atmosphere will be better next time we come."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday craving pancakes. I had the apple pancakes, piles high and covered in well, apples, apples were on the apple pancakes, with fluffy white cream, maple syrup and some sweet crispy...something.  I admit I was painfully hungover and didn't even fully read everything that was on it.  Whatever I wanted a stack of fluffy tasty pancakes, so I got what I wanted. My friend had the egg plates, potatoes, sausage, fruit? there may have been fruit on his plate.  We both had tons of food on our plates and both of us failed to finish (by god did we try though) what resulted was laying on the couch watching cartoons in post-delicious brunch food coma."}
{"text":"As a frequent brunch eater at Bloordale Pantry, I was curious to see what new ownership would bring. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised!  The space is pretty much set-up the same and looks very similar except more spruced up with new wall adornments - mural, and deer head, hello and some other small additions. The new wood bar is pretty rocking too. The new menu was thoughtfully designed and the new plates are too cute. I also appreciate the care of how food is plated and the cotton table napkins are a nice touch.  I ordered coffee, apple pancakes, a side of maple bacon. My friend also had coffee, eggs with chorizo, and crispy potatoes and some buttermilk biscuits. The apple pancakes were amazing - dense and fluffy at the same time. Beyond being plated perfectly with icing sugar, there was no need to add maple syrup as it was already done. There were spiced apple preserves and cream, too. There were so many and I couldn't even finish, I had two and shared the third. If you've ever had the apple pancakes at The Saint, these are wayyy better. The side of maple bacon was put on a small plate and heaping. Too much for one person an ideal dish to share. I also had some of the buttermilk biscuit - OMG delightful and the strawberry sauce was out of this world - try it.   I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5 since my friend didn't love her meal, she found it portioned too small and eat everything on her plate in about 3 seconds. She also would have liked more chorizo and potatoes.  Service was amazing as usual like Bloordale Pantry. Can't wait to return.  P.S. These guys are super active on twitter.

{"text":"I always thought this was a coffee shop. Went for dinner here with a group last night and it was fantastic. The food is really high quality for a very reasonable price. Everybody reported their mains were delicious. I had the pork belly. It came with a few nice thick slabs of superbly tasting meat. super flavourful. It was served in a broth with ramen-style noodles. Very good. My girlfriend had the burger. Apparently voted best burger in TO over $10. She's pretty into burgers (a huge burger priest fan) and she thought this one was worthy of the bill.  Against my better judgement I ordered the dessert. It was a butterscotch whip cream thing served in a jar. Really nice and with a good balance of super sweet with the whip cream to counter. They make everything in house with lots of local ingredients. It's really great.  I will return.  Only complaint was the wait. The food took too long to arrive. But there were 8 of us, so your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this cozy stylish spot last night.  Had delicious cocktails: a Brown Derby and an Old Fashioned.  For dinner, the lake trout on a bed of eggplant and olives, bone marrow, fish and chips, and burger.  Followed by beignets and caramel pudding.  Yum!  And the service was very thoughtful, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I went with two friends for dinner last night. It was great food. The menu had lots of options including great vegetarian dishes. A highlight was the special \"champs\" dish - potatoes, lightly mashed, with cheese and spinach. It was as good as it sounds. Really good burger with a great bun. I found the music a bit loud and it was slow to pay but other than that I have no complaints. Looking forward to many future visits."}
{"text":"A refreshing take on comfort food, with items prepared and presented well. The food is reasonably priced and the staff is warm and friendly. We tried the dandelion salad, gnocchi, and burger and thought that they were all great. The cocktails looked like they would taste great, but at $14 each I couldn't bring myself to order one.  Free little bags of popcorn at the end of the meal were really delicious. I could have eaten ten of those..."}
{"text":"VIBE Just a 2 minute walk from Landsdowne Station at Bloor? Check. No Line-up on a Long Weekend? Double Check.  Cute and cozy atmosphere with lots of booths? Triple Check. Knowledgeable and Friendly Service and nice bar clientele? Quadruple Check.   I ATE If you come here early, take advantage of the \"happy hour\" specials. I'd recommend the discounted oysters (3 for $5); I can't recall but I believe the Doorstep Slouch is $5 instead of $14 between 5pm and 7pm. Definitely worth it if you want a cocktail without the price (it's pretty good!).   Whippoorwill does seafood well. The oysters were great but the Sea Bass was the clear standout dish of the night. It was soft, tender and flaky!   I was a bit disappointed by the Thai Flank Salad - it was too spicy for my liking and texture wise, just weird - chilies and spiky things everywhere. That said, it's a hearty portion.   I love the added touch of those cute, flower laden plates you'd get at your grandmother's house.   The Korean Hot Stone Rice and Burger are next on my eats list here. I'll be back!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Say the name five times fast. Can you do it?"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Hated the remake. Bright cheerful diner now painted mostly black is dark and soulless.   Food. Pretentious and awful.   Burnt toast and only 1 slice.  Burnt bland potatoes.  Runny over spiced beans  Eggs drenched in olive oil.   Only compliments are familiar Bloordale servers and the coffee was good."}
{"text":"Great service and delightful cocktails!  The food wasn't the greatest, though. It was a little bland considering the ingredients in my frittata were oyster mushrooms, brussel sprouts and Stilton cheese (not enough).  I did love the homemade chili sauce and the accompanying salad!"}
{"text":"Whippoorwill is a small restaurant located on Bloor West near the Lansdowne subway station. This small and narrow restaurant is a mishmash of pub, diner and fine-dining elements. Although I can't confidently assert the vibe they are going for, I have never been disappointed with the food at Whippoorwill. Though I must admit, I have ordered the same thing at every visit - Potato Gnocchi with Braised Beef Cheek. The first time I visited Whippoorwill, I had the \"side\" portion of the gnocchi, and regretted not getting a bigger portion. The gnocchi was perfect - crispy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. The braised beef cheek was tender, juicy and well-spiced. It was heavenly! So on my second visit; I knew that I had to get the larger size. Several people at my table decided to get it as a side since almost everyone wanted to order their famous burger for their main. So there I sat, excited about my \"large\" portion! That excitement plummeted quickly when I saw that my \"large\" sized portion contained maybe 2 extra pieces of gnocchi, and one tablespoon more of the braised beef cheek than the \"side\" portion. WTH! Sure it came in a larger plate, but that was about the only thing that was bigger when compared to the side portion. How heartbreaking!  Don't get me wrong, the food at Whippoorwill can be exceptional, but if you like a good-sized meal, you are better off going with the burger, since the sides really are small, and the upgrade to a regular size will not get you much more food. Since I have not tried the burger, and looking back, it really is crazy that I have yet to taste this famous burger (I love burgers!), I must return to Whippoorwill so I can finally check this burger off my \"10-Burgers-I-Must-Try-In-Toronto List.\" I am also very curious about their brunch menu.  Overall all my guests loved their meal, and the burger was a huge hit. Someone gave me a potato wedge to try, and it was perfect - like the gnocchi, it was crispy on the outside and pillowy in the inside, and perfectly seasoned. I also shared a dessert, and it was delicious - no point in telling you about it in detail since the desserts we had at our dinner are no longer on the menu. Boo  Do note that they do not take reservations for brunch, but do for dinner. Also, the space is small, so it can get very loud.  Addendum - Bad News:  It looks like Whippoorwill regularly updates their menu, and they no longer have the gnocchi with the braised beef cheek on the menu. In fact, the only item they still have is the burger! They do however still offer a potato gnocchi dish, but this one comes with confit squash, and hazelnut and crispy kale. Still sounds interesting, so I am going to give it a try.  Stay tuned for my new Whippoorwill brunch and dinner review."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for eggs with sausage and bacon ($13).  The sausage is not a breakfast sausage, the bacon is surprisingly flavourless, scrambles eggs and beans are runny.  I do not care much about the breakfast, but the potatoes are good.  My companions always get and love the burgers there.  This place is overpriced, and the service is slow."}
{"text":"When the Bloordale Pantry sign came down and the windows got papered over, I have to admit that I was both sad and excited. On the one hand, I didn't want to lose my cheap and cheerful neighbourhood breakfast hideaway with the no frills original diner decor. However, I also knew that the \"long life\" individual margarine and creamer packets that came with such a nostalgic place always left something to be desired. Luckily, less than two weeks passed before Whippoorwill's big reveal and the news is all good.  To say the least, the essence of the restaurant is still very much intact. Everything just looks and feels a lot more polished. The biggest transformation is in the menu. Bloordale's was always trusty, but Whippoorwill's is something to yelp about. Off of their strictly brunch card, my date and I shared the scrumptiously dressed and cooked to juicy medium rare burger as well as the breakfast platter with scrapple (How David Chang!) and spicy beans. Both dishes were sided with their own mounds of frightfully chunky, but delicate and crispy potatoes.  Bottles of water sit on each perfectly set table to show how prepared they are for a rush at any moment. It was nice not to have to wait for the first one, but it took a quite a while after we finished our little $4 freshly squeezed orange juices before we got another bottle. Maybe we're just thirstier than your average customers.  Overall, I'm really happy with the changeover and am looking forward to going back again and again."}
{"text":"Checked out brunch at Whipporwill with a few friends on a Saturday morning.  Arriving around 11am, there was no wait or lineup for a table, which is always nice at brunch.  I ordered the BLT with potatoes ($12), others ordered the frittatti of the day which was mushroom ($11) that morning and the two eggs breakfast ($9).  Also ordered coffees and a round of Caesars ($6) to complete the meal.  Service was very friendly and quick.  Our brunches came shortly after ordering and we were offered many refills of coffee.  My BLT had really hearty, super salty pieces of thick bacon.  I can't quit you, bacon.  The potatoes that came with were just wedges, nothing special.  My friend enjoyed her mushroom frittatti which came with a side salad, and the 2 egg breakfast was just adequate.  Would definitely come back for a brunch in the future.  Can't really count on the box lunch at House of Lancaster."}
{"text":"Loved happy hour here. Returned for dinner and they did not fail either!  Super easy to get to ad it is right near Lansdowne station too."}
{"text":"For the simple fact that The Whippoorwill makes arguably the best burger in town, they instantly get 5 star rating status in my books. If it isn't the best hamburger I've ever eaten, it's definitely in the top 5 in our city. It's worth the travel to Lansdowne and Bloor.  Must-try items: The Whippoorwill Burger  There's something old school, hipsterish, yet somehow unpretentious about the vibe of this place. I love the ambience. It feels like a diner at a truck stop somewhere in the middle of America from 70 years ago, and brand new all at the same time. For the burger alone, it's easily one of my favourite spots to dine at."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in the Bloordale neighbourhood! We came here at 10:15 this morning and didn't have to wait for a seat, I've heard it gets busy later on though. I had the polenta with smoked mushrooms, crispy kale and Parmesan, it was a creamy flavourful delight! It was unique and so  different from other brunch dishes! My husband got the burger and this was fantastic as well. Coffee was strong. Great service and attention, we were topped off with coffee without having to ask. Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place last night with a great Meetup group.  It's a small diner type restaurant with dim lighting, oldies music and a homey feel. It's definitely a cute spot but if you have a large group it would be best to call and make reservations. Service was quick, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  They are known for the $14 burger, but I wasn't in a meat mood so I went with the Gnocchi with hazelnuts, squash confit and crispy kale.  It was quite flavourful and filling for the shareable portion size, very glad i didn't up it to the dinner size. There were a couple other menu items that looked really delicious so I would definitely make the trek back to this restaurant to indulge in other dishes.  For drinks, they have a killer cocktail menu ranging from $12 to $16 but I went with a beer (Oasthouse) as they have a few different craft beers on tap which is nice.  Didn't have room for dessert but from what I gathered they were quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner last week with my son (who had just moved into the area) and my 12 year old.  As soon as I saw the menu I was concerned the little one would not like the food.  My son ordered the burger with fries...served nicely...nice portion and reasonably priced for the area at $14.  Little one wanted steak so we had the only beef option that I thought she would like to share, which was the pot roast and Yorkshire with a bit of fries.  It was tender small to average size portion served with a nice portion of very good gravy.  My daughter enjoyed it.  I ordered a soup....(Mulligatawny) it was served kind of oddly.  It was placed in what looked like a very micro mini tea pot and it was thick so it was very hard for server to poor over the fresh herbs in the bowl.  It was tasty but a very small portion for $11.  My only complaint really with the soup and meal is ... I go to many restaurants and every single one that is serving this caliber of food at this price point will always include some form of bread or crostini with butter or oil.  Especially when served at soup....I would expect a little something on the side to dip in or savour the flavour in the bowl.  It may be a small thing to offer but to me it did make a difference...so much so I opted to review so the owners can maybe consider this. Service was very good, good selection of beers, atmosphere was very cool and music suited the ambiance.  Dessert...we had the dark chocolate pudding and the apple bread puddling....cute little baked in a cup presentation and contents very rich and satisfying.  Dinner for 2 with 2 drinks (since little one and I shared I think best to rate this way). $100 including tax.  A little expensive in my opinion but the food was good.  I could honestly just be put off because of the bread thing...lol!  It's my thing.  Go again...yes maybe to try brunch as I heard they have a good one."}
{"text":"Just wanted to mention that the menu here changes up pretty regularly. Always something new to try, and almost always amazing. My five star rating stands, even if the kimchi is gone from the menu."}
{"text":"Oh yes.   In fact if you're in the neighbourhood and you don't go here for food, I'd be really disappointed in you.  Food - amazing, absolutely amazing. My friend had the chicken wings and they were so good we actually went home and decided we'd make them ourselves. Or try to (that's another story).  I had rabbit which was done to perfection. It was in a really light vinegar sauce with some local greens. It was absolutely divine.  Everything on the menu looked absolutely incredible. If I'd had the hunger I probably could have ordered two or three more things just to sample it all.  We both settled on just drinking Jameson, which while it's an old comfort friend, I am disappointed I didn't try more of what they have on their drink list.  The atmosphere and decor is, excuse my language, fucking brilliant. Super cosy, feels really natural and comfortable with a touch of elegance. I just really adored the feel inside. Old diner benches, done up in a newer hip refurbished way.   The staff were amazing. We chatted about all the different rad things we could do in the neighbourhood, as well as the rad stuff that they host themselves. Really felt awesome and like it was connected to a really cool community in Toronto.   Like I said, if you don't go here, it really is your loss."}
