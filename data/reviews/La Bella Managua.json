{"text":"Server didn't speak english. Good sign.

Food was very tasty and unique with large portion sizes. I ordered the most unusual vegetarian thing I could find on the menu -- the Yucca Mixta -- and enjoyed it very much. Sumptuous fried yucca, generous avocado, and happy fried cheese, beautiful!

Definitely a great spot to keep in mind when looking for a casual restaurant that offers something different."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is a genius. The food is perfectly cooked to perfection. Presentation of the food priceless! This is a must come, you have to try it to see for yourself. The red snapper fish dish is probably the best fish around Toronto an anywhere. The prices are reasonably. Their is nothing to complain about this restaurant. 10 *********************"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Very friendly service, my food was out quickly and the quality was amazing. I had the Yucca Mixta, and despite two-thirds of the plate being fried I didn't feel too heavy after. The fried cheese was really good, especially when dipped in the \"spicy sauce.\" The avocado salad was creamy and fresh. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really wonderful place with good food, huge portions, and a nice, laid-back atmosphere. The service can be a bit slow but it's worth the wait. They have some great vegetarian/ vegan (if you just ask for no cheese) options that are very tasty - plus they have some fun cocktails.

The place is casual and seems really authentic. I've been there twice now and enjoyed the experience both times; I would definitely bring people back to see it!"}
{"text":"closer to 3.5 stars....great ceviche, good skirt steak but portions are too big and the sides were just filler to me. Beer was also too expensive for the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Down to earth environment. I strongly recommend ceviche and red snapper."}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant, I like when the other customers are people from that country, it usually means the food will be authentic. There, every body spoke Spanish and English.

When arriving, the decor isn't impressive, it gives the impression that the food is ok. Wait 'til you eat!!

I had the mix ceviche as appetizer, the fish of the day as entree and a tamarind juice. My husband had tender beef with sweet plantains. They were all big portions and tasted delicious!! It tastes like home made food when the cook really cares. 
Service is friendly and food comes quite fast. 

I definitely recommend it and will go again."}
{"text":"excellent dishes and fresh ingredients. The service was friendly. The neighborhood and ambience left a little to be desired on the night we visited, but then again, the neighborhood bock party was just getting cranked up as we arrived.
The red snapper is fantastic. I would also recommend the taco appetizer."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been looking forward to trying this spot, because were looking for really good ceviche. We did a search and this place kept showing up on Blogto and on Yelp.
The evening started off great...but we were sadly very dissappointed :( 
We ordered three appetizers, ceviche with hot sauce, mussels and deep fried calalmari. 
The ceviche was bland and had small pieces of fish and small cuts of shrimps, the banana chips that were served with it  were nice and added a bit of flavor.
 The deep fried calamari was  average at best, it was served with a aoili dip, I think and lastly the mussels which were fair the sauce was nice. 
The reason why I give this place a low score because half way through the meal a large bug that looked like a cockroach was on the bowl of hot sauce that was served with the ceviche. When I noticed it I gasped and it ran up the wall at the bar ( our table was attached to the bar) as I stood up our waiter came over and asked what was wrong I pointed at the bug and she then tried to kill it...the bug ran down the wall as she swatted at it. When it finally landed on the fall she stepped on it and killed it. She then explained to us that it wasn't what we think it was and that the building next door is doing construction so they are getting more bugs. She then said,they have called for the restaurant to be sprayed. 
It was unfortunate, hopefully they will rectify that cause the place has potential
We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place . Great ceviche, great service, great atmosphere. Their main courses are HUGE and amazing value for money and the service is so warm and friendly. Plus the price of both food and drinks is very very reasonable. I will go back there anytime. One thing though, i dont think there's much here if you are vegetarian but Im not!"}
{"text":"This. This is what good meals are made of.

This place has great food, great service and a great atmosphere. 

It's not too fancy but it's not too casual, and just strikes that great balance, which is probably why I saw such a wide array of dining groups here: there was a couple on a date, lots of families, two friends chatting and dining, old couples, you name it!

Service here is great. The servers are attentive but not overbearing, and are very sweet. They make great recommendations about the options you are given. They wear a uniform, which adds a nice, professional touch.

The food. Wow. I had fish of the day (red snapper. It's MP, and it was only $18.95). This came with circular fried plantain patties, a whole fried, moist and flaky fish, and an avocado and tomato salad. Another dish was the Carne Asada, with the marinated beef strips (slightly chewy and tough with character, the way it's supposed to be), rice with beans, with sweet and soft plantain which is the best I have ever tasted (you can choose crispy or soft plantain), and a cabbage salad with avocado slices. All the sides are designed to go really well with the main item. A dish we ordered that I haven't seen mentioned on Yelp is the Churrasco ($16.95). It's pretty much steak. They ask how you want it done. The meat was perfectly medium as requested, and it came with mashed potatoes and steamed then lightly oiled vegetables (see my photo). It comes with chimichurri sauce, which was delicious. It was really good, but this dish had less character than the Carne and the Fish, because it was more like what I could get at a typical steakhouse (creamy mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, you know?). The ceviche which we had as appetizer was just as good as everyone says.

I love their drinks menu. All mixed drinks are $8, I think a jug of San Gria was $20, bottles of wine range from $31-$39. Super modest.

This place knocked my socks off. I am so grateful to the owner chef for making this place exist, and to the lovely ladies that were our servers."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. 
Cannot recommend highly enough. 

Have had the carne asada and the pollo a la parrilla. Meat was full of flavour and tender. Comes with rice and beans, plantain and salad. Everything compliments each other and makes for a wonderful and hearty meal. Great portions! 

Service is great. Our waitress was kind and very attentive. Answered any questions I had about the menu. 

Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I feel like if I had a Nicaraguan grandmother, this is how it would feel to eat at her home: 
- Unpretentious setting: Functional, clean, comfortable
- Friendly atmosphere: Decorated with mementos and informative tidbits from Nicaragua, including map, flag, poems, touristy pictures!
- Giant portions: We're talking food towering over sturdy plates... if you have the fried fish, the tail may exceed the length of the plate. No problem!
- Delicious, wholesome food: At once comforting, grandma-style healthy (enough veggies in there to not feel super deprived of nutrition... but the fried starches and proteins are the stars!), and slightly variable from visit to visit (I tend to order the same thing every time, and I have noticed the \"recipe\" changes. No problem, it's always good, just not super consistent). I highly recommend you try the yucca fries: Morsels of golden, deep-fried bliss, that nest the softest, most pillowy bites of carbs you'll have!

Will come back for sure... to eat the the Nicaraguan-grandma-I-never-had!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with friends and wow does not convey how great it was. Everything was so fresh, really falvorfull and generally well prepared

I took other reviewers advice and opened with the ceviche....sooo good. For the main I had the Carne assada (sp). I would recommend that also but bring a big appetite cause I was stuffed

I am eager to go back and try something else"}
{"text":"Being of Hispanic decent and growing up in Texas. I had my doubts. This small family run establishment had a great simple atmosphere with people enjoying their meal and drinks. The food was surprisingly good. I had the carne asada and it was cooked to perfection on top of a bed of black bean rice. Something I haven't had before was grilled cheese strips. They ask if you want this when you order. They really shouldn't ask, it's great."}
{"text":"Walked into this tiny place on a Friday afternoon. We got seated quickly and the server was really nice! She was kind enough to go through the menu and explain everything. She explained how every day they have different specials, such as soups of the day. Super nice of her to spend time with us and she didn't rush us at all.  

The food came quick and it was delicious!! I got the carne asada that came with rice and beans, sweetened plantain, avocado and a salad on the side (the dish itself was very filling for only $13.50). The restaurant also looked very clean and the decor was welcoming. I'm definitely coming back and would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome.  I had a whole deep fried fish.  Tasted  like it was just  caught and into the fryer!  So fresh.  Food here reminds of the food I used to eat living in latin america by the sea when I was a kid.  When I miss latin america I go here to eat.  Makes me happy."}
{"text":"Tried this place as my friend lives nearby. We ordered food from there through Just Eat. 

The food tasted really good. The steak well seasoned and cooked just right. Rice was great and the plantains were a fantastic addition to the dish. Gave my avocado salad to my friend though cuz I dont like cabbage, but I enjoyed the meal. In my opinion it was a good value for the portion and taste I got. 

Will try this place again and maybe try their other dishes. Recommended if you like hearty latin american food."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place! the food is amazing and the portions are great for the price. truly a hidden gem. the staff are always very friendly and go the extra mile to make your experience really great. i look forward to any occasion to go and recently took my parents for my birthday dinner. i recommend the snapper and the off-menu weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing meal and service at the Bella Mangua. The chef did an excellent job with food allergies, and made us an amazing meal consisting of 1.) ceviche (mixed option), 2.) bisteck (for me) 3.) snapper (for my friend), 3.) carne asada for her partner. I also had tamarind juice, freshly made, while my friends tried both of the cocktail options. The food was amazing, so fresh, and so flavourful. The portions were also extremely generous. Finally, the servers were helpful and patient. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation well in advance and when we got to the restaurant there was no table for us. They tried to put a table in th middle of the walking area right in front of the door in the middle of winter. Not impressed. They said that was the best they could do. We left."}
{"text":"Amazing. I tried Nicaraguan food for the first time and I am in love. The owner, a sweet lady and her daughter runs the place and are extremely hospitable. Amazing service. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Love it! Love it!! I have been there several times. As soon as I walked in the first time, I knew that my stomach would be very happy!! :)) ceviche, red snapper, milk cake... It's highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am from central america and this restaurant takes me back home every time that I am there. Soo Good."}
{"text":"We were looking for place to try something new. And we found it on yelp. The reviews are good so we decided to give it a shot. Amazing place, went in around 750pm, Saturday, it was full. We saw people left with joy and we were served immediately. Next time I will make a reservation just in case. Food was amazing. We had. Ceviche and crab soup for appetizer. We had drink and main course. The portion was good I could not finish my plate."}
{"text":"It's 3.5.

We had:

Carne Asada ($13.50): Grilled boneless beef steak served with gallo pinto (rice and beans), avocado, deep fried plantain and cabbage salad.  Beef steak was a bit tough,taste was okay.  Good rice and beans, decent plantain.  Rating: 3/5

Fish of the day ($19.95): Red snapper, deep fried plantain, rice, mixed salad.  Good fresh whole fish.  Good plantain and rice.  Rating: 4/5

Elmacua National Nicaraguan drink ($8): This was okay.  It's sweet.  A bit of rum, lime/lemon juice and guava juice.  Rating: 3/5

Cantaloupe and Orange juice ($4):  Nice mixture of orange and cantaloupe taste.  Rating: 3.5/5

Above average place for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I always come here for special occasions and sometimes just for cravings. This place is good! I always get the carne asada because it's soo good! The meat is flavoured great and the portions are big. There's always people here. If you are looking for something different and delicious check this place out."}
{"text":"This place was as advertised.  The food was delicious and we were both very happy with our entrees."}
{"text":"Oh plantains, how I love thee.  And this place does them right.  We stumbled in for a quick lunch and found ourselves to be the only diners.  This can be concerning - do locals know to avoid this place? But it turned out that our paranoia was misplaced.

Our server was thoughtful, sweet, and helpful.  Her timing was incredible.  She checked on us enough to let us know she was available, but allowed us time to enjoy each other.  

And the food.  Completely delicious.  Big portions, hot and full of comfort.  Hit the spot on a beautiful fall day.

The decor?  Not so great.  Though sometimes this indicates the focus is on the food and not the walls, which I greatly prefer.

Head over the Bloor to enjoy this one!"}
{"text":"I always order the Yucca Mixta and it's a perfect non-meat entree with fried yucca and cheese and a refreshing avocado and tomato salad. Service is friendly, dishes consistent and location is great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food at reasonable prices. Good service. My go-to is the lomo de cerdo dish with avocado salad and extra sauce!"}
{"text":"The food is really wonderful here. I've been to this place on many occasions and it has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Good food. The meat and other sides were prepared with care. The plantains, while fried, were not greasy at all. I enjoyed the food and would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food from Guatemala. Not expensive but not cheap either."}
{"text":"I wanted to go here, after my trip to Nicaragua.
I did not know there was an actual Nicaraguan restaurant in Toronto. 
The setting is normal but the staff were very friendly.
The food was good (not that great), if you are looking for authentic Nicaraguan food- this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Party size: 9
Price: $138 before tip
Order: calamares, ceviches; pollo a la parrilla, carne asad, nacatamales, cerdo con yuca, camarones a la sabana, fried red snapper (fish of the day); three milk cake, Buñuelos, chocolate mousse; tamarind drink, orange-cantaloupe juice, cacao milk

Having never eaten Nicaraguan food, my family and I decided to try out this restaurant one Thursday night.  I'm not a good judge of authenticity, but I can say that almost all of the dishes we tried were delicious!

Our favourites were the red snapper, ceviches, calamares, and nacatamales.  The portions were large and light on oil & salt.  Nothing is worse than a leaving a restaurant smelling like grease.  I really liked how most dishes came with a side of salad.

Our lease favourite were the beef dishes.  In our opinion, the beef was overdone and tough to chew.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a casual dinner with friends and family.  However, with the lack of décor, this would not be the place to impress a date.  The restaurant was quiet with only a few small tables occupied during the entire time we were there.

Conclusion: Overall the service was excellent and definitely a must try if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Ceviche is spot on. Adore the Cerdo con Yuca and Carna Asada. Simple, well made food. The owner is extremely friendly, and will come by to chat when he's around. Definitely worth trying, especially if you're after a new local spot."}
{"text":"Decided to try some place new and went to La Bella Managua. This place is legit. The shrimp & fish ceviche was delicious! Super citrusy and the avocado was a really nice touch. The plantains were nice and crunchy. Addictive really. I ordered the fish of the day - fried whole red snapper. It was fresh and not greasy in the least. Nice light option. My boyfriend got the carne asada with sweet plantains. Delicious!! Steak was well done but so tender and flavourful. The sweet plantains tasted like carmelized bananas. Yum. 

No room for dessert as the portions are so generous. A real hidden gem in the neighbourhood. It really surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"Great place, great food.  We had a really  nice waitress, and food came super fast to the table.  The Tacos are absolutely fantastic. 
Only so so comment we had to wait for quite a while to get the check  and pay
Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Been here before. Great homemade food. Ordered the carne asada. Tastes just like my moms cooking. Quick and friendly service. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Feels like you're having healthy homemade food.
Service is great.
Love it, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"La Bella Managua reminds of two things; all there is to love about Nicaraguan cuisine and how great a simple, local restaurant can be when they focus on the fundamental elements of quality ingredients, careful preparation, and genuinely friendly service.  

Everyone who has ever had whatever the fish of the day is has raved about it (including me).  The ceviche is also universally excellent and well-priced considering the amount of fresh quality seafood.  Whenever I've forced myself away from the fish of the day, the usual result has been excellent although some of the lower priced entrees have a bit of a \"combo platter\" feel.  

Since absolutely everyone I've sent to or discussed this place has walked right passed it at least twice, they probably need to do a serious re-think of their signage.  Definitely worth your time and trouble to look up at the street numbers and come in for a meal.  You'll be pleased that you did."}
{"text":"A bit of a trek getting there and finding parking but it's well worth the travel. 

I had the mix ceviche (fish & shrimp) which was served with a very buttery avocado and fresh plantain chips. I've been on a search for really good ceviche after having it almost everyday at Four Seasons Resort Costa Rica and I must day that this comes pretty close! The main dish I had was the Carne Asana which included tender strips of beef, rice and beans (which was to die for), coleslaw and fried sweet plantain. Everything on the plate just complimented eachother. The portions were also generous so I'd say I got my money's worth. Also tried a bit of the fried red snapper which was very flavorful. Like the ceviche, it was pretty comparable to the red snapper I had at Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita.  

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday dinner. We made reservations beforehand and were seated right away.
We ordered one of those juices they had in tall glasses, which were delicious! The taste is very unique and goes perfectly with the meal.

The food arrived within 10 minutes of us ordering it. The fish was AMAZING. The fried plantain and bananas were delicious. The beef was good as well but I think it lacked some spices.
Would definitely recommend the fish.

The portions are huge and come with salad.

The server was friendly and helpful. Like other reviewers said, this place has delicious home cooked style food for reasonable prices. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with friendly staff. There are a lot of food options and you feel like trying everything. The portions are quite filling too. They have vegetarian options. I had the fush cevice with rice and beans and plantain and avocado. It was really good. I would come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Where do I begin... The moment my friends and I sat down we were asked, \"so boys and girls, did you guys just finish your last day of school?\" We genuinely thought she was joking until she went on about it. It was definitely not a professional way to treat your clientele, even if we age well for our age.  

When we ordered, I clearly ordered the roasted chicken but when the orders came she claimed that I ordered the other chicken dish. I wouldn't be as upset if she kept insisting I ordered the chicken dish and kept redirecting the blame to my colleague beside me when I pointed to what I wanted and read the dish name TWO TIMES IN BOTH LANGUAGES ON THE MENU. The staff offered a very low level of integrity throughout the service. After we all paid (with the 15% tip they slap on top), they were badgering us and harassing us about whether we paid or not. 

The chicken dish that I accepted in the end was okay. However my friends who ordered the boneless steak dish found their meat to tough, dry and rather bland. The ceviche was okay but definitely not noteworthy for the price you pay for it. 

If this is how they want to treat young professionals, I say go for it and we will take our buisness elsewhere while you wait on your baby boomers to die off. Considering the substandard quality of food and God awful service, I definitely would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE despite the good reviews. The value of the restaurant has gone downhill people from its prime and it's time to move on people. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food!  Large portion sizes at a decent price.  I had the fish of the day yesterday which was fried red snapper, served with a large helping of avocado salad, white rice and tostones. I called ahead for take out so didn't dine in.  My one qualm was that when I walked in I could smell some kind of bathroom air freshener wafting up the stairs from the basement to the dining area.  I haven't noticed that before when dining in and I don't think that would prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"Great place with amazing vegetarian dishes. They take reservations, which is a good option as they are very popular and busy. Delicious food and diverse selection."}
{"text":"Great service, genuine, friendly and attentive. Food is great! Loved the tacos (not the same as Mexican tacos). The Carne Asada was really good. Went with mixed plantains to try it out. I prefer the normal ones compared to the sweet ones. Will definitely be going back. I drank tamarind (not knowing what it was called in English I only knew it in Arabic Tamr Hindi (Indian dates))which instantly reminded me of Back home (Egypt; they also have tamarind juice there too)."}
{"text":"If you are looking for one of the best casual, reasonably priced, consistent restaurants in Toronto, Bella Managua is the place. I have been going here for several years and not once have I had a bad meal. The service is friendly and the staff genuinely take pride in what they are doing. 
The ceviche is amazing
highly recommended"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ceviche and the fried banana chips! 

Took us a while to find a seat so do reserve a table ahead if you can."}
{"text":"We loooved the fish of the day (Red Snapper at the time)! Grilled to perfection and so easy to enjoy. It was served with plantain chips, rice and an avo/bell pepper salad... delicious! 

Also conveniently located across from Bad Dog Theatre so you and your friends/family can head over for a post-dinner comedy show!"}
{"text":"A friend refferd this place and I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality!

They have some really delicious cocktails. They do serve mocktails too.

The owner personally came to check on us 
Twice and was extremely warm and friendly.

They usually serve a daily specials appetizer appetizer and main meal.

We had to reserve a table on Saturday night, it was pretty packed."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of four. Between us we had the calamari (with a fiery creole dip) and shrimp ceviche (unreal!) to start, then the carne asada, fried yucca salad and pork tamales. Dishes all came with various sides - dirty rice and beans, avocado, coleslaw, thin plantain chips, grilled plantain, and a particularly delicious fried cheese.

Everything was fresh and tasty, huge portions and under $12. Beer was 4.25 and a massive glass of house red was 6. The service was excellent, and while the place is no frills, it felt warm and lively - despite us turning up an hour before closing. Will be back, very soon."}
{"text":"I went last night with some friends we where six. Rosa took great care of us we had no idea on what to order so we asked her just to bring what she wanted. We had so much food all delicious and freshly prepared. I loved the avocado salad it had the right balance of texture and flavours. We where there on a Wednesday and it was packed. I recommend La Bella Managua to anyone who want a good meal with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Amazing food, authentic Latin atmosphere and great service! Wow what a great experience we had at this restaurant. We were greeted by a very friendly , helpful and knowledgeable waiter (I didn't get his name but he was from Cuba). When the food arrived we were blown away by the presentation, portion size and taste. All we can say is \"amazing!!!!!!\" I had the grilled chicken which was cooked to perfection. My husband had the red snapper.....fantastic. My dad had the fish fillets.... So yummy!!! They even have a kids menu! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a group of 9 on a Friday night and were seated immediately. I was surprised to see this cozy ~40 seater have such a steady stream of customers and tables consistently filled -- rezzos def recommended. Staff was friendly and I appreciated that they didnt pressure us to order before our entire group arrived, so we let know that the 8th would be the last person to arrive and were ready to order. Though we kept occupied with drinks and chatter, it took nearly half an hour before our order was taken. 
An order of CEVICHE came with shrimp instead of fish as ordered. I could tell my friend had been looking forward to fish, but eats shrimp anyways so didn't make a fuss. Served with green plantain well fried (not greasy) and a salsa that had a bit of a kick.
The FISH OF THE DAY (snapper) was just as other reviewers noted: fresh! Pan fried and served with a similarly simple but delish avocado/tomato salad. Had me feeling quite healthy if not for the rice and beans and plantain to round out the massive entree.
I sampled the CARNE ASADA and while it had nice flavour from the grill, some thought it too chewy for their liking. Unfortunately it was paired with a forgettable cabbage slaw that wasn't as mouthwatering as the avocado salad.
The SANGRIA was mixed with fruit juices along with small bits of fruit and easily drank like a punch.
Once our plates were cleared and we let know no desserts, it still took a significant amount of time to get our bills. It is hard to make eye contact with their servers! When we finally pointed out the delay, the gentleman seemed still in no rush to grab our bills. There seemed to be a unnecessarily large confusion as to how to divvy up the sangria pitchers and apps when we ordered, but the bills came out just fine.
While we are usually unfussy with service, the slow service had us pretty irked. 2.5 stars at best thanks to the food."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but good solid food.  Very natural.

My wife had their chicken, and that was definitely the highlight there.  You can taste the charcoal grilled goodness in there.

My bisteck steak was ok, but for those that don't like tendons, move on to the Carne Asada.

The size of the mains were enough to fill us, we didn't need more as they came with rice and a side salad as well.

We'd come back if we were looking for something simple and affordable.  It's not the fanciest.  It'd be better if they had a more extensive bar menu."}
{"text":"All though I was skeptical of how it was going to be I gotta say I was decent unfortunately I couldn't go back for more and I was dickapointed about that because I definitely woulda gone there again."}
{"text":"First time trying Nicaraguan food, and I absolutely loved this place. Had the mahi mahi accompanied with yuccanadas and ceviche, and everything was absolutely delicious. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Started with the mix ceviche, which came in good.portion and good flavor. But they provided some spicy vinegary onion sauce, which just took the dish to level 99. In fact, that sauce stole the show. 

I had the grilled mahimahi, which was nicely seasoned with white wine caper butter. The fish had a nice richness to it. The fish came with white rice, fried plantain, and a simple salad. Everything on the plate had a role, and it definitely was a balanced diet. 

Gf had the fried cheese vegetarian dish that came with a giant salad loaded with avocado and tomatoes. It also had fried yucca which was awesome. 

Both dishes were large portions and refreshing. They were good food and you will climb the food pyramid while enjoying the food. All the other food that came out of the kitchen looked amazing and in large portions. Will definitely be back to try other things."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Latin American foodie. So this place was next on my list to try. Although the price is not pricey, the quality of the good could really be better. The carne asada cut was thin. It was seasoned OK. Rice and salad portion were OK. The chimichurri was great and the cacao drink was a hit. Where it lost a second start was on the side portion of rice. The Christianos y Moro's. Tasted like day old rice. Aside from that everything was OK. Will have to think hard to come back. But it's possible."}
{"text":"I've been a here a couple of times and like the food, but love the service. I've had the mixed ceviche. Unlike other reviews, I really enjoyed the ceviche. 

I've had the tamales, the steak and rice and beans, along with the shrimp in white wine sauce over the three or four different visits I've had here. 

Both the steak and beans and tamales dishes are fantastic. While the steak can be a bit dry, it complements the rice and beans quite well. You have the option of getting sweet plantainsor fried savory plantains. I've had both, either is a great option. The tamales dish is very good as well. The portions for both dishes are enormous and could be split with an appetizer. 

The only dish that let me down was the shrimp in white wine sauce main. The shrimp was a little overcooked, and I don't think white wine sauces are exactly traditional. 

Stick to the traditional entrees here, and I don't think you can go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant I go with my mom every couple of months and it never let's me down.  I have not had trouble with the bill ever so it was odd for me to read that in a different review. 

Please note that their carne asana is always well done. I would highly recommend it regardless. If you want Latin American food this place will not let you down :)"}
{"text":"What a discovery, I totally love this place. 

I believe this is the only Nicaraguan restaurant in Toronto, and I've never been to Nicaragua, but I think it is a good sign that now I want to go after my dining experience here, hehe.

I ordered the cerdo con yuca, meat was tender and I loved the spices on it, yuca was soft and delicious, portion was generous. The ceviche was the star of the menu in my opinion, it had a great flesh flavour although it could have had more fish in it - and was quite expensive for the small portion.

A really nice and fresh dinner experience overall."}
{"text":"Delicious, simple, priced fairly. 
We love this spot so much. My wife ate their mahi mahi a couple of times a week when she was pregnant.
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"La Bella Managua was recommended to me by a coworker who is Nicaraguan and it's a place that we've come back to many times- always fantastic!

You can't go wrong ordering the ceviche as an appetizer. The large portion of fish, shrimp and citrus juice hits the perfect balance, especially with the outstanding thin fried plantain chips. While we have tried many thing on the menu, our favourites are Credo Con Yuca (seasoned pan fried pork on yucca and pickled cabbage) and Yucca Mixta (fried yucca with avocado salad, fried cheese, and sour cream). My fiancée always has a mojinica - basically a sweeter mojito that goes well with the dishes.

We were just there last night and the food seemed better than ever, can't wait to go again!
Just don't forget to call ahead and reserve a table."}
{"text":"This is my first time having Nicaraguan food. We ordered calamares, carne asada, and pez dorado. The calamari was very tender and came with a creamy sauce as well as a spicy onion sauce. The beef was well done and a little bit hard to chew (which I didn't like) but it was flavourful. The waitress was nice enough to let me try both green and sweet plantain which you were suppose to choose one for the dish. Both were good but my favorite was the sweet plantain. It was soft and sweet like a dessert. Bf liked the green plantain more which is more like banana chips and less sweet. The rice with beans was smoky and dry which paired well with the moisturizing cabbage salad, and avocados. The portion size was very large, enough to pack left over for lunch. Bf dish had plantain too but cooked differently also equally delicious. The mahimahi was a bit dry but the salad looks refreshing with diced tomatoes and avacados. I heard rice had coconut flavour but I didn't try since I'm allergic to coconut. Overall the food was delicious with contrasting textures and flavours. The waitress was kind and attentive. At the end she offered to pack my left over into the container without me having to lift a finger. Would like to try other dishes at this place next time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 5 years. As always, tasty food at a reasonable place. Their fried sweet plantains are really good. The Carne Asada and the Yucca are also tasty."}
{"text":"Don't recall the last time my boyfriend said \"mmm!!\" so many times in a row. And he's not the only one: you'd be wise to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The food was authentic and delicious! The service was excellent. We started with yucanadas, and then tried the Bistek encebollado, and switched for gallo pinto instead of white rice. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Their off the menu breakfaat is the best deal in town! For $7 you get rice and eggs with planktain, avacado and an amazing spicy garlic sauce! Happy healthy breakfast! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my top 10 fav restaurant in Toronto.

While in one hand the decor won't win any design awards, in the other hand La Bella Managua shows how with little a place can be homey, colourful and very friendly.
The staff is very friendly, attentive and never forceful like unfortunately many other places. They are always happy to see newcomers and people who have never tried the food of Nicaragua. They will take the time to explain each dish and make sure everyone is satisfied.

Every dish is delicious and with good portions. We were lucky to try a superb grilled Mahimahi fish with fresh salad and deep fried Nicaraguan cheese. We also had both the day's special: a whole red snapper with an avocado salad that looks and tastes divine and the humongous whole red lobster with a side of avocado salad and homemade corn tortillas and spicy salsa.  They also serve an assortment of exotic juices and other beverages. The portions are huge and the prices are low, especially for dinner.

Highly recommended for a reasonably priced, tasty meal in a highly enjoyable surroundings.

An advice? Book your dinner because this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"I had the fried fish and it was AMAZING!! My favorite spot in Toronto so far. The staff is great as well!"}
{"text":"* 3.5 stars

Son-of-a-viche! What a disappointment!

As soon as my friends and I walked in, I knew this place was for me. Not fancy in any want, lots of accolades on the wall and it had that great ma-pa shop feel. 

I, too, had the ceviche and felt pretty let-down by it. I've certainly had worse, but when everyone raves, you have to try it out. Not enough citrus zing, the shrimp seemed a little dry and I was hoping for a little kick.

Following that, I followed suit and had the carne asada. For such a simple dish, I was happily surprised. The beef was cooked perfectly,  chock-full of flavour and even tastier with the spicy side of onion and peppers. 

Like Lauren M mentioned, the plantains chips totally kicked. Big on flavour, small on oil and the sides were massive.

So, despite the slow start with the ceviche, things really picked up with the main and the rest of the menu looked solid as well, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best ceviche I've ever had! The fried cheese is also amazing... And so is their tres leche! It's a really cute, friendly, small, cozy and cultural restaurant. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Incredible flavours, attentive service, generous portions... this place has it all!

I brought a couple of friends to check this place out, tempted by the promise of great ceviche (a bit of an obsession of mine). Promise: delivered. The ceviche was delicious, perfectly tangy with a great texture and served with plantain chips. I could have drank the liquid it was in. 

I also ordered the carne asada, which came almost well done, but still amazing. I'm a rare/blue kind of girl, and I was a bit tentative about ordering the steak, but what the hell. Also, my dining companions don't eat pork and I didn't want to gross them out. They ordered the whole grilled red snapper (the fish special) and the shrimp. We were all sitting around mmming and aaahing about our food. We also ordered drinks, which were incredibly tasty.

Service was very very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere made me feel like I was not in Canada (particularly since I was facing away from the window).

And the portion sizes. Wow. Dinner was at 7pm last night and I'm still full as of 9am this morning. I haven't eaten breakfast. I usually need to eat every couple of hours or I get a bit murder-y. Not after this meal. Oh, and my dinner with 1 drink, 1 appetizer and 1 main came to $30 after tax. What the what?!

I cannot WAIT to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - I'm not really familiar with Central American cuisine, so i can't compare it to anything - but it's a very taste bud friendly menu that anyone can enjoy. Staff is warm and welcoming. The rice is amazing, there's something different about it (they they use butter in it, maybe?) the red snapper here is my all time favourite fish dish."}
{"text":"Best central American food we have had in toronto! We will be going back again and again this place is just that good!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a co-worker and decided to try it out a couple of night after with 2 friends. We loved the food.  We got carried away and each ordered appetizers and main foods. Everything was delicious.
we ordered 
ceviche
tamales
mahi mahi
soup of the day
a vegetarian dish
plenty of food to go around. everything was presented beautifuly. and the service was great.
Im gonna go back again and take more family and friends. I shall post pictures next time around :)"}
{"text":"The restaurants near Bloor/Ossington have some of the most boring signs I've ever seen. It's incredibly easy to pass by La Bella Managua without realizing you've passed by it. The lack of lighting and the color scheme makes it nearly invisible at night. Fortunately, where it lacks in signage, it more than makes up with incredible food. 

I've never heard of Nicaragua until I found this place (and I bet many of you are in the same boat hehehehe). It's in Latin America, but don't think tacos and burritos. You'll probably be eating rice and plaintains, with your choice of protein cooked in Latin flavors. Yum!

We had the Cerviche with fish, Carne Asada, and the Nacatamales. 

1)The cerviche was very delicious. I've had it somewhere before but it's not a common dish so it's hard to compare. My only complaint with it was that they could have used more fish. I felt it had way more veggies than fish. I saw a picture of it by another reviewer and that one definitely had more fish in it. Regardless, the sour flavor makes it a perfect appetizer. 

2) The Asada was flavorful. It's beef (steak) with rice and some sides. Not mind blowing, just good. 

3) The dish that really caught my attention was the nacatamales. I never had this before. The server explained that it's made of corn flour, pork and spices. It's wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. It reminds me of those Chinese gluttonous rice dumplings, except that instead of rice, it's made with corn. This is a truly unique dish. If you want something unique, I recommend this. Aside from the uniqueness factor, the flavor is there. And for $8.50, what more can I ask for?

Speaking of price, nearly everything is reasonable. Good portions, good taste, good price. What more can I ask for? The decor is not the most upscale but the \"exoticness\" still makes this place a viable date spot. This is my definition of a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I attempt to get something different -- and sometimes I even manage to order another dish -- and then as the waitress is walking away, I lunge forward in slow motion and change my order back to the usual: Yucca Mixta ($13.25). It's way too much fried yucca and fried squeaky cheese to eat in one sitting combined with too little delicious avocado salad. But the heart wants what the heart wants.

It can be a little pricy (especially for seafood) but the portions are large, and if you share dishes with your dining partner, you'll be able to try a little more. I wish there was a little more mixing and matching that could be done with the vegetarian dishes, but clearly I make do. Yucca Mixta."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night and got the last available table.  I'm so glad we did.  I had the carne asada and was so dissapointed in myself that I couldn't finish it all.  It was so delicious.  Service was friendly and fast.  Found the place thanks to other yelpers, so thanks for the reviews everyone."}
{"text":"All I could think about is Nicaraguan food!? I've never had before! I was really excited to try this resto according to previous marvelous reviews about it. I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I ordered the mix ceviche (shrimp & fish), and he had carne asada while I had the pez dorado. My dish was mahi mahi? fish and it was perfect texture! Soft, melting in your mouth kind of fish while the ceviche was rich, citrusy and so greatness! I think my favorite part of this restaurant was the quality of food, the portion size, for such a reasonable price. 

I mean granted mine was half salad, but it was FILLING. I mean REALLY filling. You definitely get your money's worth. Service was decent, and for a Tuesday night, it was semi full house. Always a good sign. 

Highly recommend ordering the ceviche mixed, and the pez dorado dish. Then again, I love seafood, so I may be a bit biased here...but go go go!"}
{"text":"Oh the food was tasty, the service was so genuine, it felt like being on vacation. Make a reservation! 

This place is very casual, very relaxed, but has a social/family type of buzz to it because it fills up quickly! 

I ordered the churrasco steak - asked to replace the mashed potatoes with the rice & beans. 

The steak was delicious, cooked wonderfully, and FULL of flavour. Definitely been marinated properly and nicely grilled. 

Came with lightly sautéed veggies (broccoli and carrots) and the rice & beans was such a comforting side to the steak. 

Would come back in a heart beat :)"}
{"text":"Took a while to get a seat on a Tuesday. Staff was really nice but things took a really really long time to come. Especially our drinks, we had the local drink and it was really nice.
I got the Carne asada and it was good. My friend got the lamb and enjoyed that too. Two other friends split the tacos which they really enjoyed even though it came on a massive bed of cabbage with ketchup and sour cream smothered on it. The calamari was not good and they didn't finish it. 
Decor was quaint and reminded me of eating when on vacation. Small restaurant. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is one of those go to gems you want everyone to know about but then you really don't! It's a small simple looking venue with a mom and pop feel that serves great authentic cooked food. The portions are plentiful and you won't leave hungry! 
I usually start with the mixed ceviche which is pretty good although I've had better. It serves to fill my craving until I can get the real deal!
The carne asada is my go to dish and it comes with rice and beans, plantain, and a salad. They do allow you to modify the sides and I recommend the sweet plantain and change to the avocado salad. 
Alcohol is fairly priced and they serve an affordable and half decent wine(s).
Now I ask, please don't tell everyone about this place as its busy enough and I don't want to wait in line whenever I have the urge for great food!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have no complaints. Both times the waitresses were amazingly friendly and helpful sharing delicious tips with us. Loved the Ceviche as this is what they are famous for but the grilled steak was equally impressive!! The portions are massive, the food is delicious  and the prices are low. What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Loved,loved, loved this place. Best fish I have ever had in my life. Definitely get the Mahi Mahi. The waiter we have had for the past couple of times has been beyond friendly and helpful. Cute place, a real hidden gem and amazing bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, served promptly at a reasonable price. We were delighted with the Lobster and Grilled Snapper. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"No he tenido el placer de visitar Nicaragua, pero ya me identifiqué con sus sabores.

Las reseñas y fotos de este lugar nos atrajeron como abejas a lo dulce. Hicimos parada un fin de semana que estábamos con antojo de algo latino. Desde que nos sentamos mi estómago comenzó a reaccionar ante el olor de los platillos de otros comenzales, mi acompañante a su vez, se alegró de ver que eran espléndidos con las porciones.

Pedimos un ceviche para comenzar. Me encantó que vino acompañado de crujientes rebanadas de plátano frito (quería pedir una bolsa para llevar con salsa valentina!!!), y salsa con mucha cebolla para mi gusto. El ceviche estuvo de re chupete: simple, fresco, y fácil de picar; llevaba pimiento, cebolla morada, jitomate, y limón.

El churrasco término medio rojo es ampliamente recomendado por su servidora. La calidad de la carne era evidente, brillaba de lo jugoso y rico que estaba. Dicho filete fue acompañado con una papa al horno altamente cremosa, adoré la textura y el sabor, ha sido de las mejores papas que he probado. Los vegetales estaban perfectamente al dente, y el chimichurri fué un complemento ideal para el platillo en su conjunto.

El plato vegetariano podría mejorarse. Como que usaron elementos muy simples y disgregados. No niego que cada producto tuviera calidad y sabor casero, pero un sope/chalupa solo con frijoles, queso fresco en rebanadas, una porción de bananas cremosas, la suculenta papa, y la micha de aguacate carecío de imaginación y unidad.

Sin duda regreso, el servicio fue bueno, el espacio es cómodo, y su sangría tuvo el punch exacto para plasmar en mi mente que el lugarcito está muy agusto."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a LARGE group of people (pushing 30 heads?) and I was so impressed by the excellent service and food. Mind you it's not a large restaurant and we took up half the room, but they accommodated us generously, were speedy with our drink and food orders and didn't get a single one wrong. Super profesh in my opinion. This is how restaurants should be run. And they were a slim team. Everything was delicious, there wasn't a single unhappy belly amongst us! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try ceviche ever since I watched Bourdain try some a few months ago.  Finally I got my chance.  At the right time and the right place we wandered into this Nicaraguan restaurant which has a true South American \"feel\". Looking into the restaurant, your back facing Bloor st., you could almost image this type of place being in a coastal South American country. The walls are covered with old maps, flags, and scenery from Nicaragua; the tables are old, wooden, and rustic. All of which added to the authentic feel.

Our waitress was very friendly. She was Mexican, but even though the menu contained more traditionally Mexican items such as quesedillas, she insisted that we try some Nicaraguan items.  We each ordered a (Nicaraguan) ceviche appetizer for ourselves, which at first she though was kind of odd, but since it was our first ceviche experience for 2 of us, we indulged it as a main course. They serve a variety of ceviche, from fish, shrimp or a mixture of both. Additionally we ordered 2 quesillo's, which is a corn tortilla wrapped around soft cheese, and sour cream.  

The ceviche just blew me away. I feel it's something I should have tried years ago. I had the shrimp variety.  It's almost like a fine salsa with schrimp, but instead of tomatoes, they use citrus as the acidic component, which \"cooks\" the fish.  Served with sweetened plantain chips to dip, when the tartness of the ceviche meets the sweet chips, it brings joy to your heart.

The Quesillo was a little too rich, but it was an appetizer, so it's not really meant to be served as a main. It's basically a burrito with a huge chuck of softened cheese (I could't tell which cheese) smothered in sour cream.  Good thing we only ordered 2 of them.

Now that I've had my ceviche experience, I'll definitely be going back for some of their other courses, which looked amazing. I kept seeing these huge plates of amazingly colorful meats and vegetables."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been over here more than 5 times. The food is delicious! The ceviche is amazing and they are one of the few places in Toronto that have plantains in every dish! the Carne Asada is great. Huge portions great for splitting between 2 people. 

Their customer is top notch. I brought my girlfriend here on Valentines day. They made it a very cool experience. Gave a rose and free desert. It was a nice soft tough. Truly a hidden gem that more people should check out."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for years and I am not sure why. We decided to try a dinner out and the food was amazing. Ceviche was delicious and recommend if you like seafood. I had a vegetarian main which we shared. Great rice and beans, cheese,cabbage salad and sweet plantains. He got tamale which was giant and a very low price. Everything, especially the rice beans and tamale,  tasted authentic and homemade. House wine was a bargain at $6. Everything we ate was good, server was friendly and attentive.  Highly recommend if you want an authentic experience at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"WHAT A GEM!
Seriously love this low key and casual Nicaraguan restaurant.

The menu seems somewhat simple in then sense of various meats with either a rice or potato and some sort of salad... But it all comes together so well and for such reasonable prices I can't help but love it. 

The tacos are admittedly very non taco-like since they are actually fried sort of like a chimichanga type thing, but they are quite delicious. 
The carne asada was well prepared and although the meat, rice and beans, avocado, and sweet plantain may seem simple, when you combine the flavours they blend so nicely, especially when adding some of the house made hot pepper sauce. 
I even had a bite of the Mahi-mahi and although I'm not big on fish, even this was pretty good.

We ate to the point of needing to take leftovers home, had a couple of super tasty rum cocktails ($8 each) to wash it down along with a moderately priced bottle of Moosehead ($5), and the bill still only came to $76 post-tax/pre-tip. Even the leftovers tasted awesome on day 2.

Needless to say, I'll be coming back. Frequently.
Reservations suggested."}
{"text":"wow what an amazing restaurant. 
we were out and about and finally an excuse to try places outside of our neighborhood. found this restaurant completely ramdonly on yelp and boy am I glad I did! 

Small storefront, we missed it couple of times walking by.

Very homey food. Delicious fish of the day. We came back a second time but that fish was sold out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, was an amazing experience with great food for the whole family. Be sure to reserve a table ahead of time to guarantee a spot."}
{"text":"I made a special trip to this place when I had a craving for a tamale and read about this place. Also never tried Nicaraguan food before so decided to give it a try.

Had a ceviche as an appetizer which was delicious and a tamale (of course).  The tamale is different than Mexican tamales in that there is a noticeable tomato presence. It didn't take away from my tamale experience and it was still delicious.

Some of the other dishes I saw looked delicious and the service was friendly so will plan to come back."}
{"text":"One of the best all-around restaurants I've come across in some time.

1) They're great at accommodating large groups - we had a reservation for 12 at 6pm on a Sunday.
2) Service is quick and friendly. Considering that the restaurant was at capacity for nearly the entire time we were there, it was impressive that they were able to bring out food in such a timely manner.
3) Options are unique - this is a true Nicaraguan restaurant with many authentic dishes to choose from. Given the rarity of Nicaraguan restaurants in the GTA, La Bella Managua is even more special.

The food here is exceptional. While the mains were clearly individually sized, we opted to have our dinner family-style. We had two apps - the tacos and the ceviche to start, followed by five mains - red snapper, pez dorado (mahi mahi), churrasco (tenderloin steak), carne asada (beef steak), and their cajun shrimp stirfry. 

Personally, my favourite dishes were the tacos, churrasco, and pez dorado. The tacos were rolled corn tortillas rather than folded flour, and were topped with salad. Mmm. The churrasco had one of my favourite sauces - chimichurri. And the pez dorado was just perfectly done mahi mahi - loved the capers as an added touch.

We finished our meal with a few bites of dessert. They had two cakes we wanted to try - the caramel sticky pudding cake and their dessert of the day, which was a flan cake. Both were quite sweet, but were light dessert offerings. At around $5 each, they were a good finisher.

I definitely loved La Bella Managua - I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has become the local favourite for my husband and I. The food is so reasonably priced, and delicious that you really can't go wrong! If you're going for the first time, let the server offer her suggestions. She will definitely tell you which things are the best and she hasn't been wrong with us yet. The ceviche is delicious - nice and tangy and delicious with the plantains. The fish special is almost always what we get and it has always been incredible. Note: there is often a very light breading on the top of the fish - but let them know if you're gluten free and they will skip that part.
Also, try the cantaloupe juice - sooo tasty.
The only complaint I would have is on the wine options. They aren't that great and they are often out of the things on the menu. I'm not sure if this place has a BYO option, but it might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Good service too. One of the few places in happy with a vegetarian dinner. The ceviche is also great!"}
{"text":"Echoing the messages of most other folks. Love this cute little spot. Went here on a Wednesday night and it was busy. My 3 gfs and I each tried something different and there was an abundance of food. Tried out the carne asada, the tiger shrimp, ceviche and pollo - all cooked to perfection. So inexpensive and definitely a hidden gem I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Visiting La Bella Managua is like eating your first meal on vacation, you're not quite sure what to order, the decor reminds you that you aren't home anymore, you're not sure they understood your order but in the end it's a great time.

I came here on a Tuesday and it was busy but not quite full. They were quick to seat and attentive throughout service. I had the calamari & carne Asada. Calamari was above average and came with a interesting second dipping sauce with a little bit of spice. The carne asada was a big portion and the beef itself was very good and quite juicy. The salad and rice were okay would have liked a bit more flavour there. Overall I was quite impressed and look forward to trying some new dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Nicaraguan Cuisine
Menu items: Ceviche, Fish of the Day and Carne Asada

Toronto is known for being one of the most multicultural cities in the world. Yet with all its variety, some of us have trouble finding true, authentic Latin spots that bring us back to our roots and remind us of how good our food is. Having previously visited and discovered places like El Tormpo, El Plebeyo and Antojitos; I was certainly happy to find La Bella Managua and delighted to add this cute little Nicaraguan restaurant to Foodies Inc. Best Latin Spots section! Definitely one spot to hit if you want to experience Latin American cuisine at its best.

As you enter La Bella Managua (translates to beautiful Managua, which is the capital city of Nicaragua), you are quickly taken away by the sounds of music, the welcoming staff and the smell of fried plantain. The smell is not 'greasyish' or dense, you do not come out smelling like it either. Instead is subtle, aromatic and appetite-opening.

Plantains are not only part of Nicaragua's everyday meals, but also a staple in some South American countries. What is it paired with? Everything!
Starting with the Ceviche, plantains are used as a spoon to scoop out all that delicious goodness of marinated seafood in lime flavours.

Having won many awards for his Ceviche, chef Jesus Morales brings in tradition and authenticity to a rather over-rated dish in this city with its many variations of Ceviche. When I tasted this Ceviche, I felt like I was back home, eating at a beach-front joint, enjoying my fresh cold fish on a hot sunny afternoon.

From cold to hot, I slowly moved to the fish of the day - Fried Snapper. Accompanied with yet another way of making plantains (mashed, then fried), the fish was succulent, toasty and well seasoned. Best part yet, it was the whole fish! Rarely do I find restaurants that serve it this way.  The presentation, just like the Ceviche, was flawless and cute. Paired with an avocado and tomato salad and white rice, this dish was yet another win in my books.

Coming into last course (OK I lie, I was sharing it with someone else), we ventured into the infamous Carne Asada. The Carne Asada is a grilled boneless beef steak served with gallo pinto (rice and beans), avocado, deep fried plantains (surprised?) and cabbage salad. The  very soft and scrumptious bean rice, served with the Carne Asada was quite good. But what I liked the most was the fact that I got plantains two ways! One as fried plantain chips, and the other using sweet plantains that are both pan fried and deep fried. Tip for Foodies, grab a piece of the soft sweet plantain and dip it in the rice. Let the rice and beans stick to the sweet candy-like coating, then eat it! Do this after you've taken a bite at your Carne Asada, and you have now learned how to indulge in something so simple as plantains!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Bella Managua (Nicaraguan food)

On our continued journey of finding affordable places to eat in Toronto. Yesterday my partner chose this busy little place on Bloor street. 

Another comfortable diner with one wall covered in awards set me at ease. Having heard so much about the snapper and seeing the large portions being served, I ordered it for my entre and we started with the crispy calamari. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed calamari but these were very good. Crisp and tender. The main was served on the heels of the app and I was impressed with the look of it. The fish reminded me of something Jamie Oliver would serve with deep criss cross cuts, again crispy with a generous portion of a kind of avocado salad, rice and plantains.  My first bit of the snapper left me uncertain, the second and third confirmed my first. Tasteless except for the crisp coating, it was worse than bland. I muddled through eating the whole fish with surprising skill having learned how to eat fish off the bone some time ago. The tres leches was very good and generous.

The cheque was around 75.00 with two drinks and here's where it got weird and uncomfortable. While my partner was counting out the money a server stood with her legs leaning on the table watching him like a hawk. I don't know if they have a lot of dine and dash but we were neatly dressed and if it were my turn to pay, I wouldn't have left a tip. Seems like a small thing, but when you have someone in your face watching like a hawk, well that's just me. 

The next morning I woke up with what I call a fury mouth, not often as a result of eating as was the case. Another notch lost

I feel that sometimes people who give out awards become ambivalent and reviews become more of a statement of a love affair. 

I'm not in any hurry to go back nor would I take a friend there like I would to some of the other places we dined. It was an interesting experience which is a criteria of our quest to explore interesting places to eat in Toronto on a budget!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was a really great find! We were looking for a moderately priced place for dinner that was something new, and this one came up. Everything we read is true! Great homey atmosphere; speedy, friendly and attentive staff; and of course, fantastic food! You know when you walk into a restaurant and at least half of those eating there are from the country of origin that it's GOT to be good. And La Bella Managua IS VERY GOOD!

We had eaten a large lunch at 3pm and got here at 8, so we weren't overly hungry and ordered the mixed seviche and the fish of the day - baked whole snapper - to share. The seviche had a perfect balance of acidity and heat, and went so well on the plantain chips with some of their homemade hot sauce (you have to try this!). 

The snapper was beautifully cooked with a side of rice and a salsa-type vegetable medley which included avocado (lots of it - yum!), peppers, red onions, and a delicious lemon glaze (I dunno what you call it - a sauce, but not creamy). Needless to say, awesome!

We will be going back, and we will be trying the other amazing-looking dishes we saw everyone around us eating. We recommend this and we're sure you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great food, very hearty and homely. I really enjoyed the tangy Ceviche. I also tried the Cerdo Con Yuca, and found the portion quite large, which is great! The staff isn't great at communication though. I asked if I had to queue up outside directly or if I can add myself to a wait list. However, they just passed around the question to each other and I didn't get any direct answer and was just standing there awkwardly for at least 10 mins unattended. Eventually I just waited outside- they really need to improve their communication. Overall, I would come here again for the great food."}
{"text":"Excellent food. As a local Nicaraguan in Toronto, this is the place to go for some comfort Nicaraguan food. Chef knows what he is doing and takes a lot of pride in his food. Service is great. Loved the experience. Menu item of choice: Carne Asada."}
{"text":"Great little place serving authentic Nicaraguan food.  I had the yuccanadas and pollo jalapeño which were delicious."}
{"text":"Even though I am not Nicaraguan, I felt like home! Large meat dish with rice - yummy!  The salad is fresh and refreshing. No heavy dressing. The rice is flavourful - traces of carrots and onions and garlic!  The meat - I ordered the carne asada - was different from what I was expecting (thinking of my mom's carne asada), hence my hesitation in raving about it. But it was grilled and well cooked. I cleaned the entire plate, so I really don't have a genuine complaint!

They also make tortillas. Real tortillas. Not the Mexican ones.Tortillas to accompany the dish. A real delicacy. You have to try your dish with tortillas!

Excellent service. Attentive and caring. 

Our group ordered different things - chicken. meat, salad, fish - and it all looked delicious. I would certainly return there to share it with friends."}
{"text":"I've never tried Nicaraguan food but I live in the area and small, cute restaurant looked authentic. I went with one other friend and we were seated immediately but the place was full by the time we left. The waitress was quite friendly and happily gave her favorites on the menu.

We ended up ordering the daily special, which was a deep fried snapper with an avocodo tomato salad and rice. We also ordered the bisteck encebolldo, which is pan fried top sirloin with tomato and garlic, served with plaintains and salad.

I'd highly recommend both dishes - fish was perfectly fried, light and crunchy, not over cooked or too greasy. The salad was the perfect compliment to the fish and was very tasty. For the beef dish, it was flavored well and the beef was nicely fried and soft. Overall, food was great and each dish is $15-20 but portions are quite large!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place because they had ceviche advertised in the window.  Oddly enough, it wasn't actually on the menu, but they made it for me anyway.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but I'd order it again.  The cantaloupe and orange juice (a first time for me) I ordered to drink was good and the vegetarian plate include tons of food: rice, beans, tortillas, cheese, avocado, and plantains."}
{"text":"I was torn between giving this place a 3 or a 4 star, but the ceviche really blew me away. if you come here, you have to try it. It's sold for ~$9 which is a great price. service was excellent as well and the staff was very friendly

the main entrees were average. the steak was a little dry. the plantain chips were great. the fish of the day was nicely done, but not the best i've had. the avocado salad was delicious. the portion sizes are really big

I would definitely come back for the ceviche!!"}
{"text":"Totally took a flyer on this place - based largely on Yelp! reviews - and it really hit all the right notes.

For starters, it was open the weekend after Christmas, and it had tables available. At a time when most other places are either closed or crammed, this little gem could accommodate our party of four. We're very glad they did.

We started with pitcher of sangria, and shared and order of yuccanatas - little hot pockets of yucca and cheese. They came with fiery but not painful homemade salsa. Our meat-eating friends also had the beef tacos.

My wife and I both ordered the Segovia Mix, a delightful balance of tastes, textures and colours. The only minor criticism was the mashed potatoes, which were a little odd and probably unnecessary given all the other carbs on the plate.

Our friends had the churrasco and the pez dorado. Everything came beautifully garnished and full of bold, distinct flavours.

The entire bill for four of us was only slightly more than $100 plus tip.

Who knew that Nicaraguan food was a thing, and that it could be this good?"}
{"text":"I have been getting takeaway from this place for about three years so they welcome me with open arms... The funny thing is that I always order probably the least Nicaraguan item on the menu: fettucini alfredo! I can't help myself. It's so creamy and fresh with big pieces of chicken and veggies. Absolutely delicious.

I will revise my review once I try other items on the menu, but in the meantime I can say the staff are lovely and it's definitely one of the better food options in the Bloor West Village area."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for awhile and finally got an opportunity when I made plans for dinner with a girlfriend.  It was the middle of summer when we went here, and without air conditioning (only a ceiling fan), it was really hot inside.  It was somewhat fun though, because it felt like we were on vacation due to the heat, and the Nicaraguan family running the place.  All they needed to do was knock down the walls and make it open air!  lol  

It was the first time I had Nicaraguan food, and it was delicious.  I had the Carne Asada, which was incredibly filling.  I had it with yellow plantains (my absolute favourite), rice and salad.  We had a pitcher of sangria to share.  The prices weren't bad at all for a home cooked meal, especially with the portion size.

The service was a bit slow, considering we were one of two tables in there.  But I expect that's probably more of a cultural thing.  Island time!  

This place is definitely a hole in the wall, but it is one of those mom and pop shop, hole in the wall places that are hidden gems.  If I lived closer, I would come here more frequently."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 4 on a Saturday night and were very glad we had reservations as the restaurant was constantly full. 

It is not a very big place but it is cozy. The service was a little slow, but it may have been due to it being a busy night. 

We ordered the drinks, ceviche, and for the mains had the rack of lamb, camarones (tiger shrimp) and a vegetarian platter. The food came out in good time. 

To start of, the drinks were very delicious, but the ceviche was not the best I have had. There wasn't much fish in it. 

I had the lamb and it was cooked perfectly and the gravy was great. My friends had the tiger shrimp and the bandeja tipica (with fried cheese) and they seemed to like their meals as well. 
The only thing I would suggest as an improvement is the service as they were very slow and we had to repeat our orders."}
{"text":"If this place was on college or ossington it would be packed.
The food takes you on a mini vacation to seaside nicaragua and you don't need many pesos for a great meal & many drinks 
Ceviche,fried beef tacos(not at all greasy)and casadillas were more than enough and great change from all the over priced pizza & burg restos in the hood
We've been here twice in the last month 
Owners are really cool too!"}
{"text":"Nuestra experiencia en este restaurante fue muy agradable, la comida estuvo deliciosa y los frescos también. Soy nicaragüense y encontrar este restaurante en Canadá visitando el fin de semana fue emocionante ya que en NY no hay rest nicaragüenses. 
Lo único que recomiendo es que llamen para reservar si es que van un fin de semana, porq si no les va tocar esperar para q les acomoden, y la comida tbn tarda un poco pero vale la pena. La atención es muy buena tbn. 
Volvería otra vez sin duda."}
{"text":"Loved this place- definitely a \"hidden gem\" on a rather bleak stretch of Bloor and Ossington.  

We attended a private function that rented out La Bella Managua. Initially I  walked right by it  and had to backtrack!  I have never noticed this restaurant before, but I'm so glad to have had a reason to go. 

The decor, as previously mentioned is very \"typical Nica\". Having just visited Nicaragua, I can attest that it is very authentic- painted stucco walls and all. 

The food we had was awesome- (better than most of the food I had while there!) The civeche was the best I've ever tasted, same with the garlic-y frijoles. Because it was a private party (they opened for us on a Monday night), we were served large platters of food to share. I really enjoyed the beef and the ground pork, as well as the fried cheese.  They served it with sides of guacamole, sour cream and salsa. Best of all I ate lots of coleslaw without having to fret about my GI tract! 

This food is beyond authentic- even better than I ever had in Nicaragua. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Conditional 3**

I ventured down bloor with my mom and dad, itching to try something different. We entered the restaurant hesitantly as it appeared dark and closed and remained somewhat hesitant as we stepped into this hole in the wall. We were soon seated and copied up a bit to the casual atmosphere of the restaurant. 

I was immediately excited as I ordered the food and it certainly met and even surpassed my expectations. The tamarind juice was mild and tasted like iced tea, ok by me. The shrimp ceviches was the first to arrive. It was a fresh delight of diced veg, seafood, and lime served with plantain chips and avocado. Next came the fish special of the day. This was an entire cooked red snapper and looked amazing with a side of rice, fried plantain chips, and an awesome avocado salad. The last dish was certainly just as generous. We got the boneless beef entree. It was very tasty but a tad on the dry side, almost like jerk-style, nonetheless very flavourful. It came with wild rice with beans, avocado, citrus coleslaw salad, and a nice portion of sweet pan fried plantain. 

We were so impressed by the authentic atmosphere of the quaint restaurant, delicious food, and even music selection. It certainly was reminiscent of a south American getaway, as the staff was all Nicaraguan. Everything was on queue for at least a 4* if not 5* experience!

Then the service took a turn for the worse....it became an nearly 30-min process to get the bill, get our change (which was given as 2 fives? no actual change). The bill itself also had a few questionable charges: the red snapper special was $17.99 whereby on the menu the fish of the day is listed as only $13.99. Then, the shrimp ceviche was listed as $9.75 when it was only $8 on the menu...it didn't turn out to be the steal I was anticipating. 

It was this that really left me with a bit of a bad taste upon leaving. Having said that the food is well worth that price, I just hate being mislead/tricked on the bill...or forced into leaving a 10-dollar tip for that matter. 

I will certainly be returning for that delicious and authentic Nicaraguan cuisine. I am hoping to really LOVE this resto soon. Can anyone tell me what was going on with the bill at the end?"}
{"text":"Brilliant. Great service. Ridiculous food. I loved the plantain. I recommend the chicken dish over beef. Will be back"}
{"text":"I love their Mahi Mahi fish! The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. Very authentic Nicaraguan food! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Attitude does not make for a successful business. 

I have previously dined here before and even brought friends to celebrate my birthday there. 

However, on this particular day I decided to bring in another person to show them what the culture was all about. 

We walked in. No one greeted us and we decided to sit down. 
There was a group of young kids there ( guessing college students). I realized after awhile that the girl at that table full of students was the daughter of one of the waitresses. And so she had brought her friends to chill there during a weekday early afternoon. What bothered me about this wasn't that they were young kids but that they made it a point to listen into my conversation in another language and talk about it to each other. The second they noticed that I was aware they turned completely red and were embarrassed. So if you are going to allow your daughter to chill at your work establishment with her friends, make sure they respect the actual paying patrons that are sharing that space and not snickering about others in a rude manner. 

Back to the waitress. 
She took our order and since we were the only ones there I figured it wouldn't take long. Well I was wrong it did take long and we had to keep looking up to see if they forgot about us. 
 
Well the food finally arrived. 
I ordered the carne asada and the other plate ordered was the catch of the day red snapper. 
Well as we ate it I noticed that my meat was on the hard side. And the red snapper was very dry even for a fried fish. 
When the waitress came over to see how our food was we told her the red snapper was too dry.
Well it seemed like the waitress was offended by it and said \" what do you mean it's dry ? It's fried fish, that's how it is\". Believe me we order fried fish in several restaurants and it's not dry inside. 
So the waitress disagreed and left us. 
She could have at least acknowledged our comment and taken it as a constructive criticism. But instead she left rudely. 

I think she was so offended that she told another waitress to finish with us while she sat at a table near the back and sulked. 

The waitress took forever to get us our bill and instead of asking if she will be needing to bring the debit machine she left us for another 5-7 min waiting. So we looked around and raised our hand to the ex waitress of ours who was still just sitting there and she rudely says loudly \" yah! She's coming!\"  at which the other waitress realized she was supposed to come to us. When the ex waitress did this there was another man who also worked there sitting at another table and I clearly heard him say in another language \"do they understand ?\" Because he clearly wanted to say something in Spanish but she told him we did understand so he remained silent. 

Our replacement waitress did not smile, barely spoke and was worse than a robot. 

This rude attitude was uncalled for and has tarnished all my other experiences of this place. But when I think about it, the service was never stellar to begin with, I just like places that remind me of Latin America. 

We were not being rude about the fish being dry. If you ask us how our meal is and we are paying, we will be honest. I didn't even get to say how dry my meat was.   Imagine how she would of been if I had told her that ? .... 

Needless to say do not come here expecting super friendly smiles and interactions. Just come here if you want to experience some sort of Latin American food with sour faces. 

It's unfortunate that I had to write this review but I only give one star to places that lack in personal customer service skills. Even if they had been super friendly but the food was terrible would they have received at least a three star. That's how far a smile or an attitude can go."}
{"text":"Ceviche was just ok. I've had amazing ceviche in Lima, so perhaps my expectations were too high... or maybe Nicaraguan ceviche is just different.

Carne Asada was decent. The beef was slightly overcooked for my taste.

Both the sweet and young plantain was good. I thought the rice was great. 

the red snapper was tasty. I hate dealing with fish + bones, but it wasn't too big a chore here.

Overall, an enjoyable meal. I don't think I would come out of my way to eat here regularly, but it was a fun experience and reasonably priced. The service was friendly and the experience seemed authentic."}
{"text":"Nicaraguan is hard to come by so we were excited to try this place out, and we all came out raving about our experience.

We started with a jug of Cacao with Milk, which our server explained as \"like chocolate milk, but much better\". We were skeptical but we did end up agreeing. It wasn't as sweet but was still rich and delicious. The biggest difference was the subtle nutty flavor that the real cacao imparts into the drink, and the sight grainy texture that makes the drink somehow creamier.

Around the table, we got the mahimahi, lamb chops and the shrimp. Every dish was delicious and everyone loved their selection. My mahimahi was buttery and soft, with a subtle char flavor. I had a bite of the lamb and it was so tender, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Loved every bite!  

The service was friendly, welcoming and patient with us (we asked about the cacao with milk for a while). I would recommend for a special adventurous dinner for two or even for the family!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most wonderful culinary surprises I've had in a long time! The staff were lovely, the food was incredible and it was surprisingly inexpensive. 

I had the lomo de puerco and two different kinds of plantains, and I also managed to sneak tastes off of my friends' plates as well. Everything was well cooked, flavourful and delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is one or maybe my favorite Latin Restaurant.
Everything in their menu is really good.
The service is amazing.
They just need to improve their decor and atmosphere, less tv news and a bit more music."}
{"text":"Great food . Authentic. Prices are very reasonable. Staff were very friendly and courteous.   I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Awesome food recommend to the fish soup.Order the snapper my favorite and that of many patrons."}
{"text":"Apparently as close to authentic as it gets in the city  

This place was delicious! Portions are ample and food is fresh. A lot of what I remember from my trip to Nicaragua! Ambiance is a mishmash. 

Fantastic: pan fried fish and the tacos (not like Mexican tacos, but super delicious in their own way). Mojito was great (no alcohol taste at all)

Good: chimichuri steak (cooked perfectly) 

Meh: empanadas and seafood salad/ceviche"}
{"text":"Although the entrees run a little pricey, you get a lot for your money. I ordered the carne asada which was $14.50 and could have easily fed two people (or half could have been packed up for lunch the next day). As it was, it was too delicious so I ate it all! The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned to a drool-worthy level. The meal also came with a coleslaw type salad, rice, slices of avocado, beans, and a choice of sweetened or green plantain. 

I also ordered the national drink of Nicaragua which I thought was a nice item to have on the menu for people curious about the culture and its cuisine. It was very sour at first, but once I got used to it, I liked it. 

The service was courteous, though a little slow and they don't check up on you often. Sometimes this is nice though! They were not snooty when members of the group couldn't pronounce some of the names of the dishes. 

The restaurant is on the small side, but there were plenty of empty tables when I arrived at around 6 pm on a weeknight. The spot grew busier as we were there, so I got the impression that it's a well-known and well-liked spot. By the time we left, multiple groups were waiting for tables. The music was pleasant, appropriate to the setting, and not too loud. The ambiance is casual/cozy/homey, and a good spot for dinner on a winter night, but try not to sit too close to the door as when it opens you get a cold blast. 

Would definitely recommend this restaurant. It was a great introduction to Nicaraguan cuisine!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday there last night with 15 people and everything was perfect! From the excellent service and staff to the fresh and plentiful food all 15 of us were super content and full! Would highly recommend and definitely return! Also they made it so easy to divide up the billing in the beginning that we had no problems settling it up afterwards without it becoming complicated and turning it into a big ordeal. Gracias!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and prices are reasonable. Staff was friendly but frequency declined towards the end of the meal. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing prices, and this place fills up fast. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because even though I made a reservation for dinner, they still made me wait about 20 Minutes for a table, even though I was on time.
Once seated though, service was great, and the food was really amazing, exceeding my expectations. The place doesn't look that nice, but the food is amazing and the prices are great too!"}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews of the ceviche, I was pretty excited about this place. Ever since I had a killer ceviche dish in mexico, I've been hooked.

Myself and a friend ordered both kinds of ceviche they have there: fish and shrimp. What a disappointment. They practically didn't taste like anything, and the amount of tomato-onion-bell-pepper to seafood was way out of proportion. Where was the acidity? the tanginess? There was a very undesirable watery pool at the bottom of the bowls too..like a poorly dressed salad.

I also ordered the fish as a main. It wasn't bad. Though it was basically deep fried, so how bad is that going to be? the sweet plantain's that came with it were actually really nice though. This dish rescued the place from 2 stars. 

2 stars for the ceviche, 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"This place rocks, and it is right across the street from Bad Dog Theatre. Dinner and a show. I have been to Nicaraqua, and thought the food was authentic, outstanding, and so reasonably priced. I would not hesitate to eat there again."}
{"text":"Waited in line for more than half an hour... So my expectation went up and have to say I'm rather disappointed with the quality of the food. Ordered Carne Asada and Red Snapper.  The only thing taste fresh is the side avocado salad with the red snapper dish. First of all when the dishes came to our table I immersed with this greasy smell I doubt they change oil often. The red snapper is obviously dropped back in the fryer to reheat under-seasoned. The fish itself is no fresh at all that bothers me I hate when i have to think twice about how long the fish dead before come to my place.  so are the plantains with the fish reheating things in fryer is awful the food would taste like old grease unfortunately. I barely touch the rice comes with the fish it was not even warm. My friend beef dish is so over cooked not juicy and extremely chewy. Rice and beans is not all right better than my plain rice it's warm! Maybe the cooks are too busy to care about the quality of the food ...."}
{"text":"Man I never imagined I'd fall in love with the food here so much. Tostones...fried plantain....shrimp and the best empanada which I can dream about again and again till I make it back for another round of food...there is this onion-y vinegar spicy sauce I'm in love with!!! I want to put that shit on every thing!!!

it's a place where.you go for the great food and friendly staff...very casual but so worth it."}
{"text":"I am lucky enough to have Nicaraguan friends who invited me to join them for a party at this restaurant. We were a group of 12 and the overall experience was quite good. 

The service was nice and friendly, especially if you speak Spanish. 

I had the fish of the day, Haddock served with plantains, rice and a avocado, pepper salad. I found the whole thing to be fresh, tasty and it gave me a great experience of authentic Nicaraguan cuisine. 

The dinning room was extremely hot though, and they weren't coming often to fill out our drinks and water glasses. 

Overall a great dinner at a fair price."}
{"text":"A lovely place to dine -- truly nice staff who are efficient and anticipate one's needs, paying attention and bringing drinks at the right time, etc.

The ambience is colourful and relaxed and interesting.  I will add that the other patrons were friendly, also -- a rarity for Toronto.

Lastly, the food is superb.  I've not had Central American food (different from Mexican food) and it was a pleasure to try a new cuisine and drinks, prepared superbly.  (I must say, even the guacamole was the best I've ever had.)

And the price for a meal is about $12 to $15 for the most expensive plate which comes with salad and vegetable, mixed rice and meat -- all in portions so large that one plate can easily satisfy two adults."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved La Bella Managua.  Excellent vegetarian options, and great meat. HUGE portions, and they always give you the option of fried cheese...who doesn't want fried cheese with that?  Went both as a couple and in a group - good variety for everyone.  As for the homemade hot sauce - it's like a mignionette - but spicy.  It's so very good.  I'm getting hungry thinking about it.  Lots of avocado and slow cooked meat. Really wanting to go back for the fish..."}
{"text":"A solid 4*s.  Knocked off a star for food taking approx. 30mins to arrive to table after ordering.

Arrived just before 3pm, ordered within 5-10mins, drinks came 15mins after that (yes, including water), and food came within the 30min mark of ordering.  I think this is a tad too long to wait.  Water should've arrived shortly after ordering, not 15mins after that.

Other than food taking its time to arrive to the table, servers did check-in with our table at least 3Xs.  So that is a good sign!

We ordered their version of Mojito ($8.50), \"Tacos\", & Pollo a la Parillia.  Mojito was pretty good, although it wasn't as alcohol-y, but with more fizz - Club Soda, I think.  Still, I think this would be refreshing especially when the weather gets warmer!

\"Tacos\" ($10) - Think taquitos, without cheese, then a coleslaw with some sour cream and ketchup zigzagged all over the dish.  They could've done without the ketchup as the coleslaw was already sour.  This dish was good, but again, not what I expected when I read \"tacos\".

Pollo a la Parillia (~$16) - basically 2 flat pieces of grilled chicken over rice and peas, some pieces of plantains, with a tomato/avo/sweet pepper salad.  Portions of the rice + salad were generous.  The chicken pieces were thin and on the smaller side.  Dish was good for 1.5 person.  

***Entrées, imo, were totally shareable esp. IF you also order an app.  On its own, you still maybe a bit hungry afterwards.***

Most of the patrons appeared to be Spanish speaking, so that gives me an indication that the spot is pretty authentic.  Not a cheapie spot though, expect to spend ~$15-20pp, without any alcoholic drinks.

I'd go back, but NOT on an empty stomach!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy and authentic! Cozy atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff. I tried the ceviche, calamari, and a Fish of the Day special - all were great!"}
{"text":"We were headed to MexiTaco down the street and happened to park right in front of La Bella Managua. So we peeked inside. The place was packed at 9pm on a Saturday night, so we gave it a try. Excellent choice! Fresh, generous, authentic, affordable, and delicious Nicaraguan food. Try the Yucanadas and the Nacatamales. And the cocktails! And the Ceviche! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's nothing fancy and it's completely understated, but the food is 100% delicious. I get this chicken thing that I love. And i've seen people get this fish thing that they look like they love. Even the desserts are homemade and amazing. 

Plus, the waiter always makes little jokes. Though I did hear him say the same joke to the table beside me. 

Anyways, 

As a person that loves to complain, i have nothing bad to say about Bella Managua."}
{"text":"Simple, fresh and authentic. Home style cooking where the ingredients shine. 
Service style matches the food. You come here with a smile and leave with a full belly of clean and delicious food."}
{"text":"If you are craving flavorful, ethnic.. \"my momma cook better than yours\"  home cooked food, congratulations, take a seat.... you've arrived!
Okay, this is how it goes...Carne asada:  Rice and peas nica style (red small kidney beans and rice)  ensalada de repollo... cabbage salad with tomato and lime .. grilled beef strip and the choice of having fried green plantain or ripe plantain ( sweet and succulent) w Avocado to boot the whole salad presentation. You also get the option of adding \"quezo frito\"... 2  slices of thick   golden fresh cheese, fried. What I love about this place is that it is consistent. You also get to try  fried fish which comes whole, deep fried and beautifully presented with  steamed white rice, pico de gallo with avocado and tostones.. thick plantain slices deep fried.  If you are craving flavorful, ethnic. welcome all.... Que viva Nicaragua!"}
{"text":"For the price the food is just ok, especially for the vegetarian options. Very bland and salty. It seems the fish is where its at. The Ambiance is lacking. Just meh. Really it's a 2.5 star place for me."}
{"text":"I love Hispanic food so much, I have been trying to like La Bella Managua, a restaurant in downtown Toronto that \"specializes\" in food from Nicaragua. But as much as I want to like this restaurant, I just don't.

BUT............

My family likes this place. Sigh. So after three attempts to like it too, I am finally writing this review and letting the world know (or the three people who read this blog-hi mom!), that I don't like this place!

Yes, there are positives....

The portions are good
Prices are decent-most dishes are under $15
They have a good-sized menu
Most of the dishes we eat in Managua are sold here
The staff speaks Spanish
They take reservations over e-mail
The food \"looks\" delicious
....and that it where the good ends

Here are my issues with it:

Service is sneaky

The last time I was here the friends I was with had a lot of questions. Some questions had to do with portion sizes and whether it would be too much if they ordered certain appetizers with certain mains. Our \"very cute\" waitress, who I termed the \"con artist\" flirted her way into getting most of the guests (guys) to order a bunch of appetizers and mains that they could not finish. Not because they eat like rabbits, but because this chick wanted the sale! I eat out all the time, and honest restaurants and staff have literally stopped me and my guests from ordering extra items until AFTER we received the first. One example: At Under the Table one of my friends wanted to order a side of eggs and potatoes with his main. The waitress made a note of telling my friend that the main he ordered is quite large, and that she thought he should wait for his main first, and that if he still wanted the eggs and potatoes, she would put the order in right away. Turns out that the main was in fact large, and there was no way in hell that he could have eaten the eggs and potatoes on top of that!

Flavors are not clean

I asked for no onions on my steak, and the waitress said, \"the chef uses onion powder. Is that okay?\" Onion powder? Can I just have my steak with pepper and salt and let the meat speak for itself? I had never eaten a single dish back home with any type of powder, period! But then again, there are a lot of people out there that believe that NOTHING tastes good without onions-so why not fake it? And my beans....well, I learned that although I hate \"real onions,\" I actually hate the fake powder crap more! My beans and beef were coated in that shit!

Chewy meat. Do I need to explain this one?

Disorganized service

If you have a note pad, and you give each person a number-as in a metal fixture to put in front of your plate to track orders (we were given a metal fixture with a number and asked to place it in front of us for the duration of the meal)-how can you mix the orders up! For example, one of my guests got cheese on his plate, and ate it not thinking anything. Then was charged an extra $2.50 for it because apparently cheese is extra. They fucked up the orders and made him pay for it! Even AFTER he explained that he did not order the cheese and thought it came with his meal! On top of that, the dishes were served in a staggered manner, and 2 of my guests were served their main around the same time that other guests were getting their desserts-they all placed their main orders at the same time! What a mess!

To be fair, most of my guests thought that the food was fine. Not great, but not bad either.  Yet we all agreed on one thing-the service was a disaster!

From this point forward, if I am craving food from home I will either go to Kensington Market, my grandmother's, or cook it myself."}
{"text":"Probably the only Nicaraguan restaurant I have ever been to, but it is literally an amazing experience. The staff is very friendly and greet you right away when you walk in. Ask for Isis, she's the best! She got my party a table right away, however I advise you to make reservations before arriving.
There are a wide selection of menu items for vegetarian, meat lovers and seafood lovers. The fish of the day is a popular choice, but I went with the Carne Asade, it's a boneless steak, that comes with a salad, coleslaw styled side, and rice and beans, and your choice of fried or crispy plantains. I highly recommend getting a side of chimmichurri sauce for the meat as it adds so much to the flavour ($2.75 additional cost)! They also bring this delicious onion/spice salsa that adds an extra punch to the meal, but you need to get the crispy plantains, so value play by asking for a mix of fried/crispy (shhh it's a secret). You will not be disappointed by the portion, just take a look at my picture! 
If you're a beer drinker, and I'm by far not at all, I decided to have their recommended wheat beer Blanche Chambly, and it was a fantastic suggestion with my meal.
I can't wait to come back to this restaurant 5/5"}
{"text":"My friend who was born and raised in Nicaragua brought me here for dinner and I am so glad she did!

The food is delicious and authentic, the portions generous and the staff are charming and prompt.

The prices are beyond reasonable for the amount of food and quality.  The menu is amazingly long and offers options for vegetarians, pescetarians and carnivores alike.  When you order a dinner it comes on a platter with so many sides like plantains, beans and rice, cabbage salad, avocado, fried cheese, and a tasty and spicy sauce with vinegar and onions that is addictive on those crispy plantain chips. 

It's a tiny place and was packed on this cold February night.  

I have a weakness for places like this where a small business owner has made a place great through quality in food and service.

I highly recommend making reservations and trying this charming spot out.

PS - I'm not a fan of ceviche, but if you are, I have been told it's particularly great here!"}
{"text":"This casual Nicaraguan joint is one of my favourites!

Being one of the only (if not only?) Nicaraguan restaurants in Toronto certainly knocks down the competition, but even if it wasn't, I would still be a big fan.

WHY? 

Prices! They're right around the comfortable mark for a casual dinner that's a bit different from the norm. Try the Carne Asada! 

Portion sizes! They're huge! And boy do I like to eat, especially if it's perfect rice and beans, or fried plantains! 

Variety! They have a big menu with lots of choices, all of which come with PLANTAINS! Delicious!

Cocoa with milk! The delicious Nicaraguan chocolate milk style drink that I just can't get enough of. 

FINALLY: DEEP FRIED CHEESE THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!

Go here. Eat the cheese. Become a lover of La Bella Managua. 

WARNING: that sauce they bring out with your main course is HOT."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere from the minute I walked into this place.

Came on a weekday night around 6pm and the place wasn't too busy. From the minute I walked in, I felt like I was in another country. I was greeted with a warm friendly smile and welcomed into have a seat even though I asked for takeout. 

The server advised they made authentic Nicaraguan food and recommended some of their more populare dishes like the carne asada.. I opted for the chicken platter and a mixed ceviche. I then ordered one of their famous mojito's while I waited.

The drink was delicious, not sure what they add in it, but it just didn't taste like a regular mojito so I would definitely recommend this.. 

When I got home I was surprised at how large the portions were. The chicken was still nice and tender despite having been in the car for over half an hour drive home. The flavours weren't anything special, but it wasn't bad either. The rice and beans were delicious and I really liked how it came w plantain AND a side avocado salad. The salad had this semi spicy vinaigrette which my boyfriend I both liked a lot. All in all I would probably order this plate again as the flavours mixed well together.

The mixed ceviche was pretty good as well, although I would have preferred more pieces of seafood in it (minus 1 star for this).. They were paired well with the plantain chips. 

Everything was made to order so expect fresh food and ingredients. I have already recommended this place to my cousins and will opt for sit-in next time so I can try the fish of the day!"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious, but the service is very bad, the waiter is disrespectful. And if you complain about bad service, they do not care. I'm not going to come back ever."}
{"text":"Charged from a Real Madrid v Barca soccer match, our large group (18+) took over a wall at La Bella Managua and ordered a feast. I enjoyed the 'pollo a la parilla\" and 'nacatamales'. The chicken was moist and flavorful. It was paired with tostones and white rice. I also recommend the mojito!"}
{"text":"Considering how big the Central/South American population is in Toronto, it seems that the good restaurant choices are very limited. Not to compare, but last time we were in Orlando, we were impressed with how good the Cuban restaurants are, for example. We always beg the owners to consider opening a franchise in Canada, but this has yet to happen. 
In any case, the food here is not great, but not bad either. We tried the Nicotamales (not a good choice), a beef and a chicken dish as well as the red snapper. The beef portion was small for the price, but the flavour was good. They seem to give you a lot of salad and rice, which is nice for a healthy diet.
All in all, a decent place but nothing really to be impressed with."}
{"text":"I've never been to Nicaragua but the food here is very similar to what I ate in Costa Rica, so I'm assuming it's quite authentic.

I'm in love with the ceviche at this place. It's so fresh and served with baked plantain chips (nice and light, not greasy/fried). They do shrimp ceviche, fish ceviche or a combo of both.

As mentioned by others, the combination plates are HUGE and cost $11-13. I can easily share with another girlfriend or it's good for one giant size man. Each meat dish comes with a few side dishes noted on the menu, but if you ask they will custom make your plate so you get whichever meat dish and whichever side dishes you prefer. The fried plantain is so tasty...mmm

I always go here with my boxing coach, who is Cuban and is friends with the owner. The staff and owner are always very friendly.

My only complaint is I wish they had some kind of lunch menu, as I find the main dishes are simply too huge for my smaller lunch appetite. But the ceviche can be nice lighter meal."}
{"text":"I walked in to get a take away for Sunday lunch. I came here before, and I decided to come back because I liked the food. The restaurant was near empty, there were only one party dining at the time. I placed my order and paid with my credit card. The server said the card didn't go through so I tried again. Then I told them I would come back after 15 mins. When I came back, the atmosphere was very strange. All workers glancing at me and talking with each other very sneaky way. I sensed that something was going on, so I asked the server if everything was all right. I'm really glad I did. Because after I went home and checked my credit card record, I found that I got charged twice. The server saying the card didn't go through was actually a lie. And, it seemed they had refunded it after I asked them if everything was all right. I had similar experience when I traveled in a developing country but I didn't expect this in downtown Toronto. I won't go back for sure. In my opinion, they shouldn't stay in business."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for months and I was finally able to visit!

I absolutely loved it!  I ordered the fish of the day which was the red snapper and it was just cooked perfectly.  It went great with the rice, fried plantains and avocado.  It was just so refreshing and felt very home-y.  Their empanadas are delish as well, crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside mmmm!

I've never tried Nicaraguan food before and this place definitely made me fall in love with it. When I come back (which I definitely will) I would love to try their Carne Asada, and their tacos as it looked mouth watering when I saw other people ordering it.  

The only downfall was our first server, as she was very dry, didn't seem friendly and gave the impression she did not want to be there.  We asked her for suggestions as to what we should get as it was our first time and she just gave us a dry and quick response.  She basically just wanted to get our order and gtfo lol.  Halfway through our dinner we did get another server who was super friendly and accomodating, thank goodness!

I will still give this place a 5 star as the food overtook that one server's bitterness and everyone else working there was super friendly!

Thank you La Bella Managua for feeding me my first Nicaraguan food and making me love it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for our first dinner in town after seeing an improv show at Bad Dog Theatre. We were so lucky to stumble upon this place. Delicioso!! We both had the Bisteca and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I found this place through a Buytopia purchase.  

The place was decorated very authentically to what you would expect in South or Central America (colourful and patriotic). We were seated right away. The menu had wide selection and we had difficulty choosing between the large range of seafood to meat dishes. From seeing what the people around us ordered, we knew the dishes would be large portions and they were!  I rarely take home left overs and after ordering the shrimp cerviche to share and my own pork dish, I had enough for lunch the next day.  The food came surprisingly fast and everything was extremely fresh. The atmosphere was busy with people of all cultures, eating to the rhythm of salsa playing in the background. 

I would have given this place a 5 star rating if the bill didn't take 15 minutes to get to us.  Service and food were otherwise excellent.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Get the fish of the day! Best pan-fried snapped I've ever had in the GTA. Super super fresh. You get the whole fish, bone in, but you'll devour it. 

Comes with rice and beans, plantains of your choice (tostones, chips or sweet), and an avocado salad. I'm could not finish it all- except that fish. 

Also- the waitresses are so friendly. They laugh and joke and make great recommendations. 

And there are a lot of options. Most under $20. Will be back! 

I recommend- can't me dressed casually. The only thing missing here is ambiance. 

Extra tip- wonderful mojito!"}
{"text":"Had the red snapper, with ceviche as a starter. High quality ingredients, well prepared. Has a lunch time vibe even during dinner hours. Friendly service in a family type environment. Been here 3 times, not sure if it is a great date place. More of a place to take visiting family from the Great White North."}
{"text":"Great home-cooked food! Beef and I shared a bottle of wine, mixed ceviche, which were both wonderful--and he had the red snapper and I had the incredible white wine shrimp! Everything, including service, was perfect. This is the real deal!

Oh yeah, and everyone is right about the hot sauce. Not for the untrained mouth!"}
{"text":"the most delicious authentic central American food from Nicaragua served here! wow! I'm sincerely happy to have dined here. a friend of mine recommended the restaurant because I was looking for the Nacatamal entre. the staff and owner of the restaurant are super friendly and helpful. the restaurant is located in a fairly busy area, so there's lots to do if you plan on having a dinner date before taking a stroll along the neighborhood. I am looking forward to coming back here to enjoy more delicious dinners as will my taste buds and stomach! there's a wide variety of foods to please everyone. a great place to have celebration dinners! lots of tables and seats, reservations are available as well. green P parking is right behind the restaurant steps away. the restaurant also offers the option of pick up orders! stop by on your way home and surprise your family with rich food! enjoy!"}
{"text":"\"Catch of the Day\" best fish i've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. The food is delicious and the portions make it worth the cost."}
{"text":"I came here on a friend's recommendation.
I came on a Tuesday night and surprisingly the place filled up very quickly. 
I had the roast chicken (half chicken + rice and beans + salad+ fried plantains) and my friend had the fish of the day (red snapper, avocado salad, rice, and fried plantains). My food came with a sweet sauce and my friends came with a spicy onion sauce. I've never had Nicaraguan food before so this was a great introduction. Everything was very yummy and I wish I tried more things on the menu. 
Both the dishes were great. The portions were large for the price. 
Service was friendly though they don't really check up on you. The restaurant interior feels very homey."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is charming in a homey, rustic sort of way-- lots of nicknacks from what I assume is Nicaragua.  I have no expertise in Nicaraguan nicknacks (nica-nicknacks?)  Anyway when I go here it's for one thing and one thing only: the ceviche, which is fresh and zest and delicious.  It's served with thinly sliced & fried plantains.  The proprietors struck me as such nice people I thought I should give La Bella Managua a shout out on yelp."}
{"text":"I've always been intrigued by the variety of food in Latin and South America, and this was my first Nicaraguan food experience.  I am also a huge fan of ceviche, so was curious to try this place out!  I ordered the yucca/queso plate, ceviche, vigarron, and tres leches cake.  Ceviche: delicious.  I would have preferred more white fish like what I've had in Peru, but already it's tough to find ceviche, never mind good ceviche, in Toronto, so I liked it.  The fried yucca and queso plate - yum!  Crisp and satisfying.  Yucca can be very starchy, but the deep fried kind was good (but really, anything deep fried is good, isn't it).  The vigarron was essentially, chicharron, a giant pile of cabbage and yucca.  Somehow it worked, and the chicharron was crispy and delicious.  The cabbage was refreshing, but the yucca in this dish fell flat a bit more for me (somewhat bland, and starchy)  Lastly, the three milks cake was super good.  Tasty!!  

Decor - simple.  The tables are a little bit low, so my back hurt at the end of the night from hunching over.  It was a bit warm in the restaurant too.  But the staff were so amazingly friendly (we had a male waiter, and another very funny waitress whose name, I think was Raquel?), so this more than made up for it.  Both were also fluent in Spanish (of course).  

Mystery: why are there still chicken fingers and pasta on this menu???  The other food stands on its own!"}
{"text":"Red Snapper Gr8 choice !! 
We were a group of 18 people and all the dishes that were ordered was excellent.
Service was excellent.
Pricing is perfect.
Will visit anytime without any hesitation."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The red snapper was amazing. So was the carne asada! The plantain feels like a great alternative to French fries. Not as flavourful as Indian or Chinese food. This was our first time trying Nicaraguan food. Ask for the hot sauce which comes with chopped onions to intensify the flavour."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Took the Mom's for Mother's Day here! Made a reservation up front but could have also just walked in from the street and they would have accommodated you just as well. Saw another larger group walk in and within seconds they had some tables set up right by the bar without a problem. 
It's a very small place but cozy and clean. 
Food was incredible, we were a party of 8 and everyone ordered something else. Every single dish looked and tasted amazing. Nobody was disappointed! Even the kids gobbled down their dishes without as much as a peep. Absolutely coming back her at the very next opportunity to try one of the other dishes!!"}
{"text":"It's a cozy, friendly and authentic restaurant. Everyone in our group was extremely happy with their meal. Everything on my plate was flavourful. Portions sizes were perfect. 
My husband, who is usually picky, loved his meal and wants to come back!
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food and amazing mixed drinks. It got very busy on a Friday night so it was very hard to get a hold of a waiter/waitress, but I'll definitely come back for more ceviche."}
