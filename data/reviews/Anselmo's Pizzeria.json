{"text":"I tried Anselmo's for the first time today because I was craving a grinder. I was already concerned when I opened my order at home and the paper sandwich bag was ripping apart! It was so saturated with dressing the bag literally disintegrated. I think the bread and meats were decent, but who could tell under all that oil? It felt like I was being punished for ordering at the end of the night. Next time do your customer a favor and tell them \"Kitchen's closed\" instead of serving a resentwich."}
{"text":"There was nothing special about this pizza.  It was plain and mediocre... I would not pay $15 again for  a large 2 topping... just not worth it"}
{"text":"This is the real deal for Naw Yawk  style pizza in the Cleveburgh area.... A+ from the crust to the sauce to the cheese. Others have tried....but Anselmo's has succeeded."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery here for the first time Sunday. The guy who answered the phone was very rude, and when I asked him what kind of cheese was in the Stromboli he dismissed my question and asked me for my address. I gave him my address and he asked me very rudely what my question was again. He advised that it was mozzarella and I decided to order it. That's what came on the Stromboli, just cheese. I reviewed the menu again and it said it came with three toppings, most Strombolis are standard, so i didn't know I had to choose. The gentleman who took the call never told me so what I ended up with was cheese bread. I also ordered a Italian sub cold, and while it was served cold it barely had any meat at all on it. It was all bread and cheese. It's safe to say I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery based on the reviews here. It was the best pizza ever!!! SO good!!!!! I seriously can't wait to order it again :)"}
{"text":"If you like NY style pizza in Cleveland this is the place to go. Chris the owner who stretches and pulls the dough right in front of you is very engaging to talk to. He twirls that dough  around his hands and sends it spinning in the air!  Definitely better than those franchise places that seem to pollute every strip mall across town. If you like independent mom& pop establishments you will not be disappointed. I love NY style pizza and this was the closest that I could find and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"I went back today!! (Yes, that was me ordering the slices and soup) I am happy to say that I believe Anselmo's has nailed it just about as close as we will probably find in Cleveland..as I'm told the difference in the crust is in the water in NY which I guess there is nothing we can do about! 
I had a couple of slices that had been in the case for about a half an hour..and they were good, so I'm assuming when I order it fresh..which for it be like home would be with extra sauce, cheese and oil! lol then I have a feeling that minus the crust issue, this is going to be the most authentic NY style pizza anyone will find here! So congratulations! I'm excited for my kids to try this again. They are very picky having grown up in NY/NJ.
I also had the Chicken noodle soup, which was very tasty..a tad salty, but overall, very good!
Now, like I said, when you start making those Jersey Subs I told you about please holla! lol"}
{"text":"I am so, so happy to update this review!  Just a few days after I posted my last review I got a message from the owner, Chris.  He was generous and offered a credit if I called back.  Tonight we ordered the meatball and Italian grinders and the fried pickle chips because I *LOVE* fried pickles.  Yum-oh!  There was a sweet girl on the phone who was very attentive with taking my order.  I was quoted 45 minutes to an hour but it arrived after an hour and 5 minutes.  The fried pickle chips came with a side of ranch and were crispy, not soggy.  So tasty!  Their grinders are huge!  I could only eat half of the Italian one but I'm looking forward to the other half for lunch tomorrow.  I tried a bite of the meatball sub which was also quite yummy.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"OK, now I KNOW this review is going to be considered blasphemous by many, and that's fine. 

My go to meatball sub has been Angelo's in Lakewood. A truly amazing piece of work that has never failed to be anything other than awesome. 

Now, I'm not entirely ready to declare a new favorite, but after my first meatball sub from Anselmo's yesterday, I'm awfully damn close. But I'm just going to have to try another one (or 12) and then we'll see. 

Regardless, Anselmo's sub is worthy of great praise. It's amazing to me how everything here is made with such high quality ingredients and care. It's obvious Anselmo's works hard to deliver not just good food, but great food.  Major props to Anselmo's!"}
{"text":"I was back in town for a week and I heard about this place having real NYC style pizza. I expected it to be typical mediocre pizza but it was really really good.

I can't compare it to pizza you might find in New York but compared to pizza you find around here, it is excellent. The crust is thin, the pizza is gigantic and it is basic and memorable. We got an 18 inch cheese and an 18 inch pepperoni and the cheese was better. This kind of pizza doesn't support mountains of toppings and the pepperoni pizza seemed overpowered. The cheese pizza was amazing and a reasonable person could eat much more pizza than usual since the crust is so thin. Get more than you think you'll want.

The people running the place are really nice and seem thankful that you're giving them a try. They have a chipotle knockoff tacqueria there too but I can't say if it is good. Based on their efforts with the pizza, I'd give it a try.

Another plus; an 18 inch cheese pizza costs ten bucks. In Chicago, they'd want at least twenty and it wouldn't be this good. If you're sick of boring mediocre pizza, try this place."}
