{"text":"The pizza is awesome!!! The garlic knots off the hook!!! Service so so but who cares after that 1 st bite!!! Never had anything else on the menu, but pizza is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and the only pizza place I also like to order wings from. Expect leftovers, since their pies essentially come in big, bigger and crazy huge. My husband and I order the \"small\" for the two of us, and always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a couple quick slices \"warm please, not hot\". After waiting several minutes was served old pizza way overcooked with bubbling hot cheese to burn my mouth. Food is awful and took some time to reach a temperature that wouldn't cause burns to eat. Three clowns behind the counter were to busy on their I phones to care about customers. Counter person with the ridiculous chin hair (goatee?) Said \" I know\" when I asked him why it wasn't warm like I had asked. They were all 3 standing around to busy on facebook or something to do their jobs. I will never return and hope the owner is losing his shirt as a result of these clowns. Furthermore they are grossly overpriced and actually solicit tips while you stand waiting for them to hand you food. Terrible food and no respect for the customers business. I know they have been around a while, but I can't wait to see them close."}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly counter service. I've tried the pizza and meatball sub. The onion rings are really good too! Good, quick go to lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"This is based on a sandwich I had today.

Had the chicken parm sandwich.  This was horrible.  The chicken was like chicken nuggets.  Only four small nuggets on a 12\" sandwich.  Bread was good but was very disappointed.  Maybe the pizza is good but don't get the chicken parm."}
{"text":"Love this place, usually hit it at lunch.  You can get two giant slices of cheese or pepperoni or a slice, salad and drink for $8.  I'll usually get the two slices and eat the second for dinner that day."}
{"text":"There are 2 great pizza joints in the Ballantyne area and this is one of them.  NY style slices that are thin and large."}
{"text":"I am actually addicted to their chicken parm sandwiches. Closest thing to Ny pizza in Charlotte. This place is great"}
{"text":"Excellent New York-style pizza!!!  My husband and his father, native NYers, highly recommend this pizzeria!! I love that every time I come in the staff is warm, welcoming, and efficient!! Great people, delicious pizza!! New York pizza with southern hospitality!  Go, go, go!!"}
{"text":"I like Tony's!!  I think their pizza is pretty damn good and they have HUGE slices!!  I stop by for the lunch special (2 slices and a drink) for about $8 and always leave satisfied.  The guys are pretty friendly and your food comes out fast.  Also, the place always looks clean, so I have no complaints!!  Tony's is a winner in my book, along with NY Pizza on South Blvd, these 2 places are my go-to for pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lay one of these ginormous slices on me any time!  Lost count of the times famished me hit this place for cheese and pepporoni to go, and I'm  far from the only one in line.  NY style for sure with a chewy thin crust and lots and lost of slightly spicy and thicker cut pieces of pepporoni dashed with a more than generous helping of oregano.
They pop it in the oven, and mere minutes later you have a piping hot slab of deliciousness to go!

One slice is guaranteed to put your hunger to rest!  I must admit, I've never ordered a whole pizza or dined in, but I will remedy that some day!  

A very casual and old school atmosphere, great for kids or a casual dinner or stop before heading somewhere else for the evening,"}
{"text":"Yeahhh, this is the last place in Ballantyne I would go for pizza not horrible but is just above takeout pizza from the grocery store."}
{"text":"We ordered a large cheese pizza. Everything was good until we found a sharp piece of hard plastic baked into the pizza! We added a photo of the unexpected topping. Save your money and skip the garlic knots. They were small and not worth the price."}
{"text":"TOO HIT OR MISS LATELY! We have been going to regularly Tony's for years. Unfortunately, I'm afraid we're done. It is way TOO EXPENSIVE when over half the time you'll get food that's clearly been microwaved - rubbery and unable to chew. It's a shame because when it's fresh, it was delicious. Those good moments have become too far and few as of late."}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok, the crust has to be frozen pre madenot up to this NY Italian's standards. Salads were just ok also.  My beer was past it's drink by date. The parking lot is a nightmare at dinner time because of the after work crowds at the two pubs in there. The staff is friendly and the tables were clean."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!!  I usually grab a slice on my lunch break.  Even though it's popular, there is never a long wait.  They have lunch specials and their slices are HUGE!  I've probably eaten here 10 times in the last year and I've never had a bad experience.  Prices are very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"this is the worst pizza if ever had for $30.00.I got 3 slices of pizza,12 wings,and 2 cups of sweet tea.first no one working here is american let alone Italian!seems to me they are all Mexicans working here,2 of witch I could bearly communicate with.I told them I wanted the wings double cooked and they were dried out.they are supposed to be crispy not dried out.the pizza was gross!anyone who says this is good food doesn't know what quality food is.this is not authentic NY pizza considering I grew up and lived in NY just outside nyc most of my life (28yrs).the sauce on the pizza is discussing under cooked,and extremely expensive. I'd say what I bought was worth at the most $10.00.also considering the area it is in you would think quality not quantity. neither was there.this is the type of food I would get to feed my kids and the babysitter before I went out to eat.I'm glad I ate this trash first before feeding it to my kids, never would I subject my kids to eating this over priced garbage. they need to rethink the prices and the quality of the ingredients. poppa johns and dominos flips a better pie than this place."}
{"text":"I agree with Mariano.  There are two GREAT pizza places in South Charlotte, and this is one of them.  Do yourself a favor, and eat here!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Truly the best pizza in South Charlotte, hands down.  It reminds me of NY pizza and the slices are huge!  When I bring my son pizza to school this is my preferred place to get it because he loves pizza and the slice is delicious and large.  They have all the awesomeness to sprinkle on your pizza like garlic powder, parmesan, chili flakes, seasoning and the staff in there is super nice and they make you feel like they are truly grateful that you've patronized their establishment.  I have also had their cheesesteak and fries and the cheesesteak was so darn good that I'll pardon them on the fries that may have been in slight need of new fry oil.  If I ever have a hankering for pizza and subs, I'll bypass the pizza place in walking distance of my home and drive the few miles up the street to Tony's.
The place has plenty of seating indoor and outdoor, a usable and clean bathroom and a great menu selection. They even have daily specials for cash paying customers.  Sorry credit card folks.  I'm not sure if I'll venture off the pizza and cheesesteak path but if I do, I'll surely add it to my review.  Not much else to say so stop reading and go get some pizza and a cheesesteak and then enjoy your food coma while it lasts.

That is all!"}
{"text":"The best NY style pizza in the area.  Great cheese steak sandwiches also!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza place until now. I ordered a pizza online of full pepperoni and sausage and half with added mushrooms and onions. I got a pizza with half pepperoni and sausage and half mushrooms and onions so I went back. Instead of getting a hot pizza back after they messed up, I got a pizza back immediately where they threw the missing pepperoni and sausage on it and sent it back to me...no time in the oven, just half cooked pepperoni and sausage - which is NOT safe to eat (sausage). I didn't expect a new pizza, all they had to do was add toppings, but I did expect it to be COOKED PROPERLY. It will be a very long time before I go back - if ever again. I don't expect to have to bake a pizza like this when I get home just so it's safe to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  Yummy calzones, garlic knots and thin crust pizza.  The bread on the sandwiches is to die for good.  Try the eggplant parm.  Anytime we head out to eat it is my kids' first choice.  We really think it is the best pizza place in the area.  For a fast casual pizza place it just has a little more character - plus the food and service are consistenly better than anywhere else we have visited."}
{"text":"If Tony's were more consistent, I'd give it a 5 -- some days they have great NY style pizza and great staff. Other days / times, the pizza and staff are not nearly as good. If I stop in for a quick slice, I'm not sure which experience to expect, including the size of the slice (normally slices are large and 1 is a meal).  The atmosphere is super casual - you order at the counter and pick up your food once it's ready. Single slices are available any time, or you can order a whole pie, pasta, sandwiches, etc. The only thing I wish were different is consistency."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying that you can only get NY pizza in one place....NY. Im a native NYer, and Im certian there is no such thing as 100% authentic NY pizza anywhere else. But, for a New York style pizza place in North Carolina, Tony's is exceptional, by far the best I've had. The crust is thin, but thick enough to fold, the sauce has the right  balance of flavor and the cheese and toppings are great. After trying one pie and the garlic knots, Im a loyalist; I wont be going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Just moved into town and had a craving for Pizza. Took a chance and ordered a large combo and it was delicious!!  Will definitely order again. I only wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Great food always friendly staff when I'm being served. Giant size slices, great subs at a great price. Only wish they would deliver and this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Yay!  Very good NY-style, thin-crust pizza.

Yes, I know y'all are sick of hearing us yankees complain about pizza, but we take our pizza seriously.  So far, this is the best pizza I've had in the Charlotte region since moving down here 13 years ago.

I ordered a lunch special of a slice of pepperoni with a small salad and a fountain drink for $7.50.  I think this is pretty pricey for a lunch special, frankly.  I think this should have been maybe $6 tops.  Not because it's inferior or anything, but just because I don't think a lunch special should be so expensive.  That being said, theirs was a larger-than-usual slice--very generous.  A lot of places take their large pie and take more than 8 slices out of it for their lunch specials, so you get smaller pieces.  Not here.  This is a full slice from a large pie.

First, the crust is the most important.  Tony's was nice and crispy on the bottom, and doughy underneath the toppings.  I prefer a big, poufy edge crust, and this was very thin, but it was yummy.  Very good crust, with a little dusting of flour on the bottom.  Perfect for folding in half--the way pizza should be eaten.  

Then, the sauce is important, too.  This sauce was just right--not too tangy, not too sweet.  Very simple and tasty.  Lots of places just don't get this right, or they use whatever marinara sauce they usually put on their pasta dishes.  There should be a difference.  This was very good.

The pepperoni and cheese were, well, pepperoni and cheese.  Not too much or too little, and very tasty.  I'm not a big fan of lots of toppings (usually just pepperoni & mushrooms for me), so I'll leave the toppings comments to those of you who pile it on.

The salad was a typical slice-and-salad kind of salad:  a little clamshell box with lots of pale iceberg lettuce and only 2 little cherry tomatoes (I like lots of tomatoes), but there were lots of black olives and some banana peppers in there, as well as fresh shredded mozzerella on top.  It's just a salad--nothing to get excited about--and I guess it's what you'd expect.  Doesn't matter cuz I'm all about the pizza anyway.

I will definitely go back when I need a pizza fix, which is unfortunately all too often for the sake of my waistline, but what can I do?  Guess I'll order a salad with it.  ;)

Yous guys enjoy your pies, ya'll."}
{"text":"Place was empty Saturday at 5:30, that was odd. The place was nice and clean. The guys behind the counter need some work on their customer service. No one said hello, he just stared at me. The first guy I talked to I am pretty sure he couldn't speak English so motioned for someone else. The guy who did help seemed uninterested. When my pizza was ready I barely heard him say \"large cheese\". He put it up on counter and walked away, no thanks or come back. 
The pizza was good, NY style but you need to ask for well done to make it better. I did. And they didn't, but it was still ok. Just came back from NYC and the kids said it was close enough. We will probably go back when going by that way but won't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Perfectly made New York pizza! I'm from Brooklyn, NY, so when Insay it's good, believe it! I always get the 24\" slices...GIANT, greasy to the right degree, and perfect crust! This place is a fave all the way. I LOVE Tony's and will continue to visit to get my pizza fix. Nice, clean joint, great atmosphere, and great pizza. No complaints, only compliments. Keep it up, Tony's! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best meatballs in town. 

I say that with the preface of lately Tony's has been very hit or miss. Sometimes they are amazing, other times they are ok. Their pizzas are huge. Like the box doesn't fit in the oven huge. And (we have tested this) the bigger the pizza, the better it tastes. 

We have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, for dinner, for family functions, leaving Duckworths.... Normally we are very happy. Sometimes, we don't know where it went wrong. However, the good times outnumber the not-so-good times. 

They have a frequent visitor card, where if you spend $100 on pizza (or buy 10 pizzas) your 11th is free. We've filled up quite a few cards. 

Get the meatballs."}
{"text":"3 Totally Awesome Reasons to LOVE this place:

1. Huge slices...so big they don't fit in the to go boxes! Literally they flip the ends up just to fit....and they are delicious! If you love NY style pizza...this is the place you will want to go! And trust me one slice will fill up up!

2. And someone has already said this but its soooo true! They have the BEST garlic knots I've ever had! Always hot and greasy, plenty of garlic and a delicious sauce on the side to dip them in....mamma mia!!!! So good!!!

3. Subs are delicious too! I've had the Italian sub and its on crunchy toasted bread, loaded with meat and your veggies and wrapped on the plate in reynolds wrap....come in 8\" and 12\"

I've never been disappointed with anything on the menu...everything is reasonably priced and super delicious! 

Will I be back....OF COURSE!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area, bar none. Love their NY style large pizzas. I am yet to try their calzones and sandwiches, but I don't think they'll disappoint."}
{"text":"We come back over and over, driving to get pizza vs delivery, and its totally worth it!  genuine NY style.  The cheese & toppings are fresh & have rich taste like top-quality should!  Price for the amount of food is also great!  Like real pizza should, they use a real pizza oven, not a conveyer belt! Keep it up Tony's!!!!"}
{"text":"Estoy furiosa porque mi esposo fue a comprar una pizza y dos porciones de alas en otras ocasiones estas  habían estado saladas y nosotros siempre nos hemos quejado que le bajen a la sal luego las mejoraron y estaban muy buenas pero hoy día estaban horribles de saladas llame y hable con el manager  que es un latino mexicano y lo que me contesto es que me daría gratis una pizza pero que le iba a decir a sus colegas que no nos vendan más alas.donde uds han visto tamaña grosería ?les pido a un manager sobre este tipo que me contacte y que despida a este individuo de ese lugar no es saludable para ese negocio.igual yo voy a investigar y voy hacer una queja ..."}
{"text":"Great 2 slices of pizza and soda special - and the slices are enormous, with the perfect cheese and sauce!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but made the mistake of not doing research before ordering. In a rush to get to a meeting I ordered a personal pizza which should be listed as a small. This thing came on a 12\" pan cut into 8 small slices."}
{"text":"Tony's is not my all time favorite pizza, but it is pretty tasty when you are craving a big ole slice. I like that I can stop in at lunchtime and get a slice along with a salad & drink for around $8.  They are super quick so I can get in & out in a hurry.  

They have a house-made dressing that is good... I think it is Italian. The garden salad is not just iceberg lettuce with tomatoes - it also includes good stuff like cheese, black olives & banana peppers. 

As far as my pizza, I always get plain cheese & the flavor of the sauce comes through. It is pretty good sauce.  The slices are ginormous, so folding it to eat is a must."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. It's been a long time since I've had a good slice of cheese pizza that actually reminds me of a of the slices I had in NY years back. Tony's really does a great job. 

Goodness gracious, check out my photo for the scale of a single slice. It's the size of a small planet, food with it's own zipcode, it's own weather system, and website. Massive, to say the least, and so good. You've gotta fold one of these monsters. Unless you decide to go the fork and knife route, of course. At less than $3 per, two of these guys and a cup of water is a mighty fine and cheap choice for lunch. 

The greek salad and garlic knots were just fine, too. The knots could slay a vampire from behind a steel door. Garlic and garlic aroma: plentiful. 

The service is fine. A little aloof at times and their methodology behind announcing when your order is ready escapes me as being close to efficient. Customers just jammed at the counter and they were trying to figure out whose order was whose. Just a cluster. 

The prices are super affordable and the food is great. I'd come back in a heartbeat if I were craving a good slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Big pie by the slice!
I fellow NYer took me here for a quick slice of pie.  She said it's the closest to real NY pizza.  The portion was large for the price.  I asked for sausage and onions on our slices and they had to cook the ingredients from scratch--got our slices about the time our company was finished!  The dough was a bit flat and the cheese tasted cheap and old.
We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch often, you cant beat there lunch deals. Pizza if always pretty good, salads or also decent. For 7 bucks u cant beat that for lunch. The staff is always nice"}
{"text":"All I can say is this is the BEST pizza in the south east...Taste just like NYC style pizza. I went there on Saturday around noon.  It was not crowded my sister-inlaw  ordered  a large cheese  pizza which was HUGE and they got one bigger than that. Also a basket of the garlic knots. mmmmmmm it was delicious. I will be going back there again...This place can be seriously addictive."}
{"text":"Well, it seems to be tough for me to find a really good garlic knot, and for some reason, thats important to me when grading a New York style pizza place.
I ordered on the phone near closing time. The pizza was ready in about 20 minutes, so that was fine with me. Another important element...... they got my order correct. I split the halves of the pizza, so I love when they dont foul things up. The workers were nice and friendly at closing time, so I bet they are even better when they are not itching to go home. 
As for the food....... I have to say that the pizza was pretty good. Worth a 4/5 for that alone. I will have to try a few more in the Charlotte area before I praise it too much, but it was good. The garlic knots though.............. I thought they were quite sub par. They were very tough and dough-y. These have a dipping oil type coating, which is good...... if I was using it to dip my bread in at a restaurant. I guess I am used to light textured knots with a garlic/parmesan cheese coating, not flavored oil. But hey, I liked the pizza............... and its \"Tony's Pizza\" not \"Tony's Garlic Knots\", right?!?!
I'll be back."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza and service. The baker ziti I would not reccomend but the pizza was spot on. Greasy but spot on."}
{"text":"This is the closest I have found in Charlotte to what I think of as the \"real\" pizza I loved in New York as a kid. Big, chewy crust, dripping with gooey cheese. Just awesome. Doesn't need any toppings other than cheese to be perfect. The Ballantyne location is clean, open and easy with little kids. Staff is friendly.  Definitely my \"go to\" pizza place - would be even more so if they delivered, but I don't believe they do (except through a third party service, which I would be skeptical about using). My wife likes Portofino's pizza better, but she is not from NY, so her archetypal pizza likely differs from mine."}
{"text":"True New York pizza ! The crust is made perfectly everytime I go there, and the environment is inviting. 
I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza.  Lots of competition out there, pizza-wise, so am reluctant to venture into yet another pizza place which might be a disappointment.  Good news is that Tony's is a solid, good pizza place = A-OK.

Wife and I did not do pizza, yes...same fear of disappointment; so ordered baked lasagna and spaghetti with sauce, plus meatballs and cheese.  The extras cost:  $2.95 for the meatballs and $.75 for extra cheese.  Did not like paying for cheese, though.

Both were good and tasty.  No complaints.  Tony's is clean and the counter people are helpful and courteous.

Given this experience I think we will be back to try the pizza.  They were sure serving a lot of them, both to eat-in and to-go.  So they must be pretty good, also."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had Tony's Pizza and it was at a different location.  I now know why.  It's another alleged NY style pizza place, and while it's not terrible, there is just no flavor to it.  The sauce needs a little spice and/or sweetness to it.  The Greek salad we had was good.  Overall, I'm glad I had a Groupon that I bought with referral credits so the pizza and salad only cost me a few bucks.  I'll probably stick to Libretto's or Lorenzo's for a while.  I will say the people at Tony's were nice and they did not skimp on the cheese."}
{"text":"Great experience all around! The staff is super friendly and happy to help, and the food is consistently delicious. The slices are bigger than my dang head"}
{"text":"This has always been a place for my family to grab a good slice of pizza.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and definitely set up for enjoying a good conversation.  
The pizza seems to have morphed over time however.  The sauce to cheese ratio is becoming heavier on the sauce side.  But all in all, they make a really good pie."}
{"text":"The fact that this popular pizza joint has remained in the same location amongst an ocean of change over the past 15 years may say all you need to know about its popularity. In fact, they serve up some of the area's best quasi-NY style pies and calzones in the Ballantyne area all while providing friendly service (most of the time.)

The dining area is comfortable and laid out sensibly. The sanitation score is consistently high. In short, you can count on these guys as your go-to pizza joint; however, they do struggle somewhat with consistency. Their overall package easily earns them at least 4 stars and they are among the best two pizza restaurants in the area, but they are not quite in my Gotta Try category."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in CLT. Slices are large and the crust is the perfect thinness. 

They have daily specials and sell by the slice. The only con is, if you get pizzas to go and ask for plates, they charge for these flimsy paper plates."}
{"text":"I'm almost ashamed to say that I have never had their pizza (almost).....Their calzones, on the other hand, are off the chain....always made fresh (so you probably wanna call ahead to order) but good to the last cheesy ounce...."}
{"text":"Holy smoked provolone I love this place! The only close second is Libretto's and their location in Ballantyne leaves much to be desired on taste and service...although they do have nice outdoor seating and ambiance. When it comes down to just taste I pick Tony's. You know pizza is good when you don't want toppings, side dishes, condiments, etc. When just a plain slice of hot cheesy goodness is heaven in your mouth, and you start wishing you could eat your weight in it. 
I am not sure if it's true, but when Tony's first opened one of the employee's told me their crust was so crispy and good because they use water from New York. I am not sure if this means they ship it here or have some sort of reverse osmosis time/space travel machine, but it's great. Tony's crust HAS what many \"New York Style\" pizza restaurants in the south lack...crunch. Your pizza should have so much cheese it runs of the slice, the cheese should be so salty and delicious you could eat it alone, the sauce should marry the flavor of garlic and oregano on your tongue, and if you have to fold the slice to get its entire girth in your mouth then it should snap almost in half! I grew up mostly in Massachusetts, but I come from New Yorkers and I know good pizza...Tony's is good pizza!"}
{"text":"Another place that I found has some great NYC pizza, The slices are big  ! That's a plus ! The lunch specials are good. Garlic knots are  good . Buffalo chicken wings they have is one of favorites coming from a pizzeria ! Definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves pizza"}
{"text":"Not the best if you are ordering  anything else besides pizza.  I ordered boneless wings I asked if I could split the flavors (2) nope...then I got fried chicken pieces with a side of teriyaki sauce...Never again...The pizza is ok but huge slices..not better than Librettos and more expensive!"}
{"text":"Disappointing and expensive.  Surly service at the counter.  Lots of folks back there talking amongst themselves.  Tony's touts freshness, but the spinach on our pizza obviously had been frozen, not fresh spinach leaves.  Yes the pizza slices are huge, if that's what you're looking for.  I'd rather have smaller, more flavorful slices."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst pizza I've had in some time. While the portions are huge, it lacks anything good. The slices are soggy and oily in the middle and the farther away you get from the center, the crust becomes like cardboard. They are also not fresh because they pre make cheese pizza and then just put on any topping that people ask for and then reheat it in the oven for a couple of minutes. Looks like most of the ingredients are canned and not fresh as well. Such was the case with the mushrooms and pineapple on our slices."}
{"text":"The pizza is truly authentic, fresh and a good size.  The only downfall is that it is very pricy.   You won't be sorry for trying this place.  I get pizza every time i go there for business."}
{"text":"Strike up the band cause I hear Dino crooning in background...\" When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's amore\"

Tony's Pizza is a casual pizzeria tucked away in Ballantyne shopping mall. This location is fairly large and very clean. The décor is nothing fancy but the food is pretty good. It is definitely NY style hanging out in the south.  I usually go for their pepperoni and cheese thin pizza slice for a quick lunch with a soda. For under $5.00 dollars it is a great deal.  I wouldn't be intimidated by the long lines the service here is fast and friendly.

So when  the moon hits your eye you gotta give Tony's a try!"}
{"text":"Been awhile since we have been here and overall it was not bad, just overall ok.  Ordered the cheese pizza, white pizza,  and Italian sausage appetizer and side Caesar salad.  The cheese pizza was great but thw white too garlicky.   Wife said garlic was too raw.   The italian sausage was over cooked.  And the salad was ok and the kens Caesar packet surprised me a bit.  Would have been great to have not seen that. ..at least make me think its made there."}
{"text":"My dining mates and I tried Tony's pizza after hearing about the great pizza there. Large pieces , thin crust, definitely New York style.
Slightly greasy cheese,  sauce not overly sweet and slightly spicy which all contributed to that good  mouth feel.
The garlic knots were very good. 2 diners had the chicken parmesan, nothing special and would not reorder again as the chicken was somewhat dry and chewy edges. .The side salads were basic but  good. The place was clean and the service friendly and attentive. We ate around dinner time and the place busy with diners.  Prices were reasonable. We  would definitely return again just for the pizza."}
{"text":"Too good quality and taste. I moved from NYC and this is the only pizzeria where I found the best pizza, garlic knots and everything. Don't hesitate to try cheese garlic bread."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but we were appalled with their lack of customer service. We had a party and ordered carry out from this place. They forgot some of the order which we didn't realize until we were home 30 mins away. When we called to notify them, the manager did NOTHING to apologize or make up for their mistake. In all my years working in the restaurant industry, I have never spoken with as stubborn of a manager as I did last night. It's a shame that they would let something so small ruin our experience so drastically."}
{"text":"Tried Tony's for the first time tonight.  We're talking huge pies here...but you'll pay for it.  We had the house special pizza (pretty much loaded).  Crust was great - thin and crispy, was cooked perfectly.  Sauce tasted pretty much like straight up canned tomato sauce - nothing to write home about.  And the toppings were basic mass produced...for the cost of the pizza I would have expected at least the use of \"real\" italian sausage rather than just the standard crumbled that you get at Dominos, etc.  All in all, a decent place to get pizza, but I think I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"NY Syle Pizza!!!!! I have been going to Steele Creek in order to get NY style pizza since I moved here four years ago. There is such terrible pizza and charlotte and now I am glad I found something close to where I live, however, it would be awesome if the delivered (hint hint). Let me not forget to mention, the guys behind the counter are very friendly, very attentive and rembered me only after two times. I am a HUGE fan of great customer service and its nice to be remembered."}
{"text":"If you don't know by now from the other posts, these slices are HUGE. I haven't found NY- style pizza better than this in Charlotte. 

A great place to go for lunch, bring the kids, or a cheap date night."}
{"text":"This is great pizza. It reminds me of New York pizzerias. The restaurant is simple, the atomosphere is comfortable and welcoming. The staff always has great conversation while you wait for your pizza. And the pizza is flavorful with just the right amount of sauce. Not too much. But my favorite thing about the pizza is the crust! It is a little crunchy on the outside and soft and yummy on the inside. Just like the crusty bread you get at the table of an Italian restaurant. Good stuff, Maynard!"}
{"text":"Gluten free option a real bonus. Best NY Style we've had in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The pepperoni or cheese slice pizzas are pretty good, outside of NYC.  When I'm in the mood for some bad carbs, or I really need some thin-slice pizza, this is where I go.  Slices are huge, and the taste is pretty good.

Really hate the girl who works the front counter.  She's kind of abrupt and lacks warmth.  Same thing with the guys who place your order.

But if you need something quick, this place is it.

(Their wings and sausages are horrible.  Who slices up the sausage into coin-sized slices, when ordering a sausage on a roll???)"}
{"text":"Massive pieces of NY-style pizza with a nice balance of cheese, sauce, and crust.  Authentic and fast...so happy to live nearby."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place.  I've been bragging about how good it was, and then last night happened.  UGH.  Lackluster, uninspired, plain, no soul sums it up.  The sauce was unseasoned and like it was poured out of the good ol' Sysco # 10 can.  Crust, dough all flavorless.  Still the same big slices, so if you're just looking to fill your belly.....this is your place."}
{"text":"I love Tony's for lunch.  Go there all the time.  I get a big slice for a great price.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Old school, no coupons no website.   Great pizza, pizza rolls, pasta.  Best pizza in Ponte Vedra.   White pizza was awesome, our friends like the grandma.   We also tried the spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna.    Give it a chance."}
{"text":"I like Tony's. I've had authentic pizza (straight from Italy) and this didn't seem to be too far off. I usually opt for a tomato and spinach combination (gotta get the greens in there somewhere), and I've never been disappointed. The service is also pretty good--the guys (I've never seen a female employee) are usually friendly and the orders are made in a timely manner. It's minutes from my job and the only reason I don't frequent here more often is because I can't eat pizza everyday. But you're alright in my book Tony. You're alright."}
{"text":"This is also called \"Tony's Pizza of Ballantyne\" on Yelp.

This is one of my favorite pizza spots in town.  A true northern style pizza place, and yes, it has big, bigger and OMG that's huge sizes.

The smallest pizza is enough for two with leftovers, and for the true pizza aficionados we call it breakfast.  What better way to start the day, than to relive the beautiful emotions you had last night while the pizza was nice fresh and hot.

Now that spring is here, it does offer an outdoor covered patio section, and the service is always fast and friendly.

Do yourself a favor, drop the larger pizza chains, and give these guys a try. The pizzas are reasonably priced, and I can assure you that you will NOT be disappointed.

{"text":"I am a NY area transplant is the south for eight years so my standards for pizza are lowered. Had a large cheese pie. 

Pros: large slices and pies, good volume, not too thick or thin, nice cheese/sauce balance, sauce is tasty, overall tastes like a NY slice except for one thing

Cons: Rubbery crust, tough to chew. I'll admit it softened up when I reheated it in the oven but still not very good. A bit pricey for a large pie at 16 bucks but par for the area. 

The pie was ready on time when I got there."}
{"text":"This particular weekend I had a desperate taste for a slice of pizza.  I have been back in Charlotte for about a year from NYC (Brooklyn to be exact) and from my previous experiences in Charlotte a lot of the places that I stumbled suck really bad,  especially the ones around where I stay.  Anyway,  I had another spot the day before which is still amazing (that'll be another review) but since they close on Sundays and I had that desperate taste for a slice again,  I decided to try this place after reading some recent reviews.  Anyway,  I have to recommend this place as it is delicious and the slices are humongous.  Even if you were to eat one slice,  it'll get you full.  The cheese is delicious,  the texture is thick but not overpowering, and the dough although a little thin,  it was still good and it held its own perfectly when I was folding it.  Plus,  the place is clean,  the service is quick and the staff was friendly,  if you from NY and you want to get a slice that'll remind you of back home,  hit this place up because it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE."}
{"text":"I have never had the pizza here so this review is based solely on their subs.  I had their cheese steak back a long time ago and remember it being ok but nothing special.  

Recently I've tried their Italian sub and cheese steak once again.  The Italian sub is very good made as it is on the menu.  It comes on warm toasted bread with ham, salami, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and oil and vinegar.  Highly recommended!

The cheese steak on the other hand just kind of sucks!  It comes with steak, cheese, onion, mushrooms, and peppers.  The ingredients seem fresh enough but its just not that great...the flavor just isnt there and it was kind of salty.  Plus I ordered it with mayo and mustard of which it had neither.  Try Penn Station on Providence or in Rock Hill for a tasty cheese steak.

From the other reviews it looks like the pizza is pretty good so maybe I will try that next.  Two thumbs up on the Italian sub, two thumbs down on the cheese steak sub and for that it gets an A-OK of three stars for the time being!"}
{"text":"Tony's Pizza just isn't very good. I'm sorry to dissent from the positive reviews and I suppose it's possible we just happened to go on an atypically unimpressive day, but we found our visit to be a real disappointment. My husband ordered the sausage and peppers sandwich and it had absolutely nothing going for it; there wasn't even cheese (bizarre).  Just the appearance of it would be enough to send anyone who likes sausage and peppers sandwiches into a deep depression. He ended up just forgetting about it and we picked him up a different meal on the way home. We ordered the chicken strips and fries for our toddler and they gave us half the number of strips that is listed in the description and simply explained that they ran out of them yet still charged us for the full order (weird). It was frankly as if the staff was aware that the place was mediocre and had utterly given up even the pretense of customer service.  When we arrived, we were the only patrons there yet when our food was ready, it wasn't brought to our table. Someone barked and so my husband went and picked it up. It was just an oddly missed opportunity to do the obvious thing and bring the food the 20 feet between kitchen and table. I had pizza and it was fine but unremarkable. If someone wanted to pick up a pie to bring home, I wouldn't try to persuade them not to. If they wanted to eat there or order that \"sandwich\", I would offer to help them find a better lunch/dinner option."}
{"text":"Very good piece of pizza, I got one pepperoni and one cheese by the slice. Huge pieces for only 3 dollars each. Tastes just like NY."}
{"text":"Slices of pizza are huge! I ordered 2 and I could only finish 1 slice. Slices are more on the crispy side. I know some people like that but I like it softer."}
{"text":"I am so glad to find a \"by the slice\" joint in Ballantyne. The slices are humongous! I wouldn't really recommend any of the sides, I would just encourage you to buy a slice. The crust is nice and thin. I will say that I prefer Benny Panellos over Tony's but if you are in the area-  definitely check this out. It is a fast casual type resturaunt, which I didnt expect but it means you get your food really quickly which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I have had better... much better. I will give them this though, their crust is thin and pretty good, but it wasn't the greatest quality cheese and the sauce was kinda sweet Sweet sauce is something you def won't get on NY style Pizza... EVER!!! I was born and raised in NY. Moved to Charlotte a year ago and have been suffering from the food scene here.  Every time I go back to NY (and I do go back quite often) I get pizza and I assure you that Tony's does not compare..."}
{"text":"The pizza was good had better but the chicken wings were awesome super crispy and flavorful!"}
{"text":"really like this place.  super nice staff.  always clean.  gluten free crust option.  fast, hot and fresh food."}
{"text":"Good for corporate work functions - but not necessarily what you want at home on a Saturday night... I do admit that I continue to order it as the location is so darn convenient - perhaps I need to try more than just the pizza?"}
{"text":"Hello Friends,

Short and sweet. Once I caught the eyes in the young lady at the counter that was taking pictures of herself I ordered 1 slice on pizza. Once I got it I did my fold test... It failed. In fact it cracked. Huh?? Yes.. Cracked. Pizza came out piping hot though so that's a plus. May try them again, if so I'll update my review. But if not, I can always think back to the crunchy crust \"Ny pizza\" I had. 

I'm pretty greedy guy so the 3 plate slice of crunchy pizza was well worth the 3 bucks. Don't mind that at all.

{"text":"The best pizza in Ballantyne!   You're served with a smile and the food comes out fast!  The place is very clean and they have condiments on every table.  The pizza slices are huge and it's only $3 per slice. The meal deal of 2 slices of pizza and a soda for 7.25, is worth every penny! Reminds me of being in New York!  Looking forward to going back!  
They also serve subs, pasta, salads, calzones, etc..."}
{"text":"Perfect thin crust, big slices and reasonably priced but the pizza had no flavor.....the sausage also tasted funny. I used to work in a pizzeria so I know the business, so I was extremely underwhelmed. I want to try as many new food places in the Charlotte/Ballantyne area but unfortunately this will not be a place I visit again."}
{"text":"I've been searching for NY pizza now for four years and Tony's wins the prize, hands down. Slices twice the size in NY and ambiance feels like your home with the giant NY subway maps on the wall. And, oh yeah, the pizza is superb."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza especially when you're on the go. I found that it was a little too oily on top, but I was starving!!! We initially decided to sit in, but forgot that we had a hair spot for my son in Waxhaw which was about 25 mins away so we asked for it to go. If I feel like a slice of pizza, I'd definitely go back. I felt a little creeped out by one of the guys working there. He was staring at me like he was trying to figure out what my race was. STILL! Why you gotta be so rude...?"}
{"text":"One of the rare places in town where you can get \"a slice and a drink\". Pizza is better than what I've found in midtown Manhattan recently, and probably a whole lot cleaner :) 
Try the garlic knots, the meatball sub, the pasta. It's all good!"}
{"text":"Moving back to NC after living in the NYC Metro area we have been missing some true authentic NYC pizza and this is the place! Not only can you get it by the slice but the Pies are Amazing!! Crust is perfect, service is great and it's a great place for a family too!!"}
{"text":"Tony's Pizza is a great place to pick up lunch in the Ballantyne area. They have an extensive menu with several New York and Sicilian-style offerings. In addition to pizza you can also get calzones, stromboli, ravioli, lasagna, ziti, among many other different pasta dishes. I've only tried the pizza and stromboli but have been very pleased with both. The fare is slightly greasy so be careful if you're in business dress. Definitely check them out if you're in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"As a die-hard New Yorker, one thing I do know is the difference between good and bad pizza. Delicious options.Homemade baked ziti, crispy jumbo slice pizza, and Philly steak are my favorites. Been twice in two weeks and planning on going in a couple days.....found my home away from home"}
{"text":"After visiting their Galleria location, I thought I'd check out this location & once again I was pleased. The food & prices are great and this location definitely had a larger crowd & friendly service."}
{"text":"Sort of New York style pizza in Ballantyne. We had the meat lovers and a \"supreme.\" Both were good though a little greasy. Expected, with all this meat on it.

Service was excellent. The restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, the large really is LARGE.  They are one of the few places that does meatball toppings right, the sausage, jalapeños and other veggies are all good too. Been coming here for years, the one negative is occasionally (~5% of the time) the crust gets overcooked and is too crispy for NY style. Prices are ok, not a bargain but worth the quality.  Try to find a coupon and you'll be all set."}
