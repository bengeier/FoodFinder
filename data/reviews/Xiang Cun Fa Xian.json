{"text":"My friend who stopped by in Mississauga said this is her favourite restaurant in Mississauga, so we came for dinner. It was so hard to choose what to order, as they offer a wide selection of authentic Chinese dishes. We ordered the stir fried potato dish, and the potatoes were thin and crispy. We also ordered mapo tofu, which had a great consistency, but was a bit too salty. Additionally, we got stir fried eggplant which had a great sauce, both sour and sweet. The mapo tofu and eggplant dishes usually come with meat, but the waiter was very understanding about the fact that I was vegetarian, and told the chef to omit the meat in those two dishes. Just a heads up: both the mapo tofu and the stir fried potato are pretty spicy! Also, Chinese cuisine is usually on the saltier side, so you may want to order a bowl of rice like my friend and I did. 

The service was great, our waiter was very helpful, and was able to cater to my dietary restrictions. Both my friend and I spoke in Mandarin to the waiter, so English might cause a language barrier for those who come here who cannot speak Mandarin. Additionally, I love the fact that this is a very authentic Chinese restaurant; you can even pay in RMB here! 

Verdict: Will be coming back in the near future to try a variety of their other dishes."}

{"text":"I've been to the one in scarborough multiple times, only recently realized that a store opened in sauga, so I bought my parents here for early father's day dinner. Waited for at least 45 mins after we gave our order, 3 tables that arrived later than us have all had their food on their table. We asked three times where our food was, no straight answer given, and we can see the servers struggling with their computers, probably messed up the order but would not say a single thing to us.
Finally we just got fed up, and left the restaurant at 8pm - we arrived at 7pm.
Will not come here again."}
