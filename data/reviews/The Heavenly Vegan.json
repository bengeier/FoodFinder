{"text":"Love the Heavenly Vegan and Maximina's food. She really spends the time finding organic and non GMO ingredients so that you get the best quality. The Vietnamese brown rice noodle salad with sesame vinaigrette was really good too. She offers pickup or delivery so you can get a nice platter of food for yourself or family. I highly recommend trying her food!"}
{"text":"THE BEST!!! 10/10! Perfect score. Food is so delicious  no hassle! No stress food delivery service!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering meals from The heavenly Vegan for the past 6 weeks. The meals are fresh, flavorful and very nutritious. It doesn't hurt it is a good value too. We have used another meal prep service and this is far superior. Maximina really puts her heart into her work and uses excellent organic ingredients. Highly recommend!"}

{"text":"During the summer I work long hours and don't have time to cook or go out to eat.  I've been ordering food from the Heavenly Vegan and taking it to work with me and I am loving it.  The food is just delicious.  I always feel good after eating it too.  The menu changes every week.  Everything I've tried has been spectacular.  Give it a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I picked up my second order this week and this is Truly the best vegan food I've ever had you make eating healthy so easy for someone on the go and the variety you create is AMAZING!!!! I can't say thank you enough! As a hair stylist I'm so busy the last thing I want to do is cook any thing let alone healthy. I'm so glad I found you! Can't wait to see what's on the next menu!!!!"}
{"text":"The Heavenly Vegan is a lifesaver for me. I recently went vegan after being vegetarian for 15 years and it is impossible to stay committed when you don't have time to plan/shop/cook. Maximina plans the weekly menu, does the shopping, and the cooking, and even delivers the meals to my door! This is exactly the support that I need to stay committed. The prices are extremely reasonable and the best part is there's no minimum. I select how many meals I want for the week, I pay for that week, and it's done. Seriously, if you have thought about going Vegan but don't have the time to cook, it doesn't get any more convenient than this. And the food is really good!"}
{"text":"Maximina is so passionate about her cause. She loves cooking and educating people on how our choice of food can play a major role in determining our quality of life. The presentation AND the taste of her food is spectacular. Everyone can enjoy her food. She makes veggies taste amazing!"}
{"text":"10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I am so glad I found Maximina and The Heavenly Vegan. I was on a long search to find a meatless meal prep option and thankfully I found The Heavenly Vegan. Maximina provides you with delicious, healthy, vegan meals, and you can tell her food really comes from her heart! There are so many things to rave about, but the top three things that stand out for me is the quality, portion size, and convenience.

The quality of food that Maximina provides is spectacular! I feel at ease knowing that she cooks with non-GMO and organic ingredients. When I was looking at other meal prep companies, it did not seem to be a top priority for them. Many other companies did not offer meatless options either. One company even admitted they only use about 20% of organic and/or non-GMO ingredients... Yikes! I like to be knowledgable about the food that goes into my body, and The Heavenly Vegan takes away any doubt I have about good and healthy plant-based food. Also, you can really taste the freshness in the food. I love seeing how Maximina incorporates so many different colored vegetables into her recipes. Her food is not only delicious, but it is a sight to see!

When ordering from The Heavenly Vegan, I was worried that I might feel hungry after eating the meals. Boy, was I wrong! The portions that Maximina provide are HUGE! I feel full after each meal, and sometimes I even had to split one meal into two. I feel that her meals are really worth every buck.

Lastly, I have never tasted such great vegan food that was so convenient! Sometimes I don't have time to cook because of work, but the meals from The Heavenly Vegan take away that stress for me. The meals are well packaged, easy to heat up, and some I even ate cold! This vegan food is very delicious and it is even better than some vegan sit-down restaurants I've been to. I can comfortably eat at home, not waste time in a restaurant setting, and still get yummy, fresh food.

I will definitely continue to order from The Heavenly Vegan, and I will recommend it to all of my friends & family!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for gormet, organic, vegan food then Heavenly Vegan is it!!! She personally makes each dish taste just like heaven!! I love that she offers unique dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Pick up or delivery available so if you are to busy to leave the office or want a weeks worth of meals that you can freeze, she is the way to go! I promise you won't be disappointed!! She has gluten , soy and wheat free options as well! She's always changing up the menu, so you will never be bored! Whether you are vegan or not, you will love her food! I give it 5 stars because I've tried a lot of vegan places in Vegas and she is definitely one of the very best!!!"}
{"text":"I looooove Maximina's vegan food.  She offers a variety of vegan food that can be customed to your needs such as gluten free or raw vegan.  She also offers delivery, if needed. She's also flexible with her meals... for example:  I brought a loaded sweet potato.. but I don't like sweet potato, and I asked for a regular potato and it was done:)
I think her prices are fair considering she does do organic.  It's $8 for a breakfast item, $10 for a lunch item and $12 for a dinner item.  She also sells snacks and desserts on the side.  I appreciate the amount of items she offers each week.  It's a good variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner items.  I have been ordering from her for about a month now and here are some of the things I love:  
-western cheese burger is to die for!!!!!  
-wafflewich or any breakfast sandwich she has is great!
-peanut butter and jelly cookies
-oooh, i love the chocolate and vanilla pudding!!
Give her a try.. you'll be happy that you did!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I started ordering from Maximina because we wanted to eat healthier without sacrificing flavor. I'm not Vegan but I see the benefits of eating Vegan and I eat a few Vegan meals a week. Her food is not only delicious but filling! We have both lost weight eating her meals too! Her meals have totally squashed my misconception of vegan/vegetarian foods to be bland and not filling. Also, buying her pre made meals has really been convenient since I don't have to cook as much! Her prices are very reasonable too considering the quality of the ingredient used."}
{"text":"Maximina is simply wonderful. And her meals are so delicious! She is very sweet and patient. And she answered all of my questions. Her meals are perfect for my lifestyle. Because I'm always on the go."}
