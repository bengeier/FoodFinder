{"text":"Great home style eastern European cooking! The borsch is fantastic, also had a vegetable soup there which is as good as my grandmother's - really!!! This is a nice choice if your in the mood for great comfort food, it's old school dinning at it's best. We enjoyed a plate of stuffed cabbage which was typical, my husband had a schnitzel and was very pleased with his meal. May not be a first date kind of restaurant but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. YUM!  Excellent old school eastern European charm.

 I had the Polish plate; this consisted of Pierogi with cheese and potato, Pierogi with meat, kielbasa (surely housemade), Potato pancake, a cabbage roll (veal), and a sauerkraut w/beef sort of casserole.  It was epic!  I think the combo varies according to what's around in the restaurant at the time.  The cabbage rolls aren't on the menu, but were part of the daily special.  I also had a simple small salad that was fresh & vividly colored w/fresh veggies.

I sampled the mushroom/cabbage pierogi and they too were amazing.
The staff speaks English, and were very helpful and friendly without being overbearing. This is close to the university & a subway stop, but also has a tiny parking spot in the back, which you might want to take advantage of, as street parking looked very full."}
