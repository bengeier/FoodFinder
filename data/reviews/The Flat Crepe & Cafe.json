{"text":"I had the raspberry crème fraiche crepe. It was delicious. My boyfriend had the apple cinnamon. Wasn't as good. The staff were very nice and happy. Coffee was decent."}
{"text":"We were there for breakfast on a Thursday morning, so we were the only ones there. Great breakfast crepe with fresh fruit on the side and nice big coffee out of a real mug. If you live nearby, I'd suggest giving it a try. Warning, they don't do the full on Nutella coated crepe like at the Farmer's Markets. These are lighter and fresher tasting. They do sandwiches too, but I haven't tried one yet."}
{"text":"headed there yesterday morning with a $40 coupon and two of us, after looking at the menu decided there were no way we could eat that much food but would do our best. Two large lattes (okay), a chicken,brie and strawberry crepe, turkey and cheese sandwich, ham and cheese omlette and the dessert crepe with chocolate and bavarian creme. Had wanted the peking duck crepe but they were out of duck. First of all they write down your order and add it up on an iphone (???) had to do it several times as she kept a different total. Asked for the dessert crepe after we were done the first three but asked for the first three all together. So... got our coffees after a few minutes then out comes the first crepe - bland, bland with virtually no fillings for $8.50, no sides no nothing, ate probably a third of it. Omlette comes out, good, fluffy, hot with toast and fruit (around $7), only thing worth eating. I continue to wait and wait for my sandwich which finally comes long after hubbie has eaten his omlette, then right behind it comes the dessert crepe. Sandwich is average at best served with stale chips. No bavarian creme for the dessert so I suggest the creme fraiche which is on the menu on another crepe. Not creme fraiche but unsweetened whip cream. Crepe its strawberries and banana with a bit of chocolate sauce on top. Uninspired but edible. If you are desperate, go there and have an omlette, otherwise I would suggest a wide berth."}
{"text":"Finally, another great little breakfast place in the south end! Hidden in the plaza by Safeway, the Flat Crepe & Cafe is a great spot to get breakfast food all day. As the name suggests, their speciality is crepes - both savoury and sweet - but they also offer breakfast sandwiches, eggs done any way, and other traditional breakfast items. You order food at the counter, sit down, and they bring everything out to you. I ended up ordering the Peking Duck crepe with hoisin sauce, green onions and cucumber, a side of two eggs scrambled, and a soy latte. My friend got some sort of avocado crepe, but I can't remember what was in it.   My uncle makes the BEST Peking Duck crepes I've ever had, so I wanted to see how these compare. Unfortunately, the duck wasn't that good because it wasn't fresh and juicy off the BBQ spit... but what can you really expect? I also didn't get my scrambled eggs, but I didn't ask for them because it was only $2, and while I was there, I made a dramatic, semi-life altering discovery which made me lose my appetite. But with that aside, everything was very good. The crepes are made fresh on the spot (as they should be... unlike that crepe place in the food court of TD), they have good variety of menu items, and the crepe options looked fantastic. I am definitely coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is closed. But if you're in the area check out Pâtisserie Du Soleil!"}
{"text":"Some finds make me realize I need to open my eyes when I do my everyday errands. Thankfully the other day I had my eyes open just enough to catch this little gem.   Located in Woodbine, this little beaut is fast becoming my favorite eating place. The staff are beyond friendly (I'm pretty sure I'm only 1 or 2 visits away from them greeting me by name) and even their basic sandwiches are awesome. Of course their name is why I originally went there and if you're a fan of crepes (who isn't?) then you will not be sorry for popping in.   You basically choose from either their savory or sweet crepe menu. Every single item sounds so delectable that you'll want to come back again and again just to try them all. And if you're not feeling crepey (nice pun eh?), they have an equally appetizing sandwich selection. Heck... even the coffee they serve is top-notch.  If I do have one complaint, and it's more a testament to their quality and growing popularity in the neighborhood, is that if you don't get their early for lunch they may sell out of some of their ingredients. Otherwise, enjoy your next visit cause you know you want to go now."}
