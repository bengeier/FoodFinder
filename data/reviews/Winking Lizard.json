{"text":"Not sure how you could rate this place 5 stars. Most of the time it's decent enough. Average to \"a-notch-above\" bar food.. most of the time. Although quite often the service is slow, it's loud, and the food is not \"right\".. as in they've not changed the fry grease in a while. Overall decent enough place.. especially if you want reasonably priced chow and decent beer to swill. Actually their beer list is the strength. And thank God it's smoke-free now. In the past it was like eating in a break room at the mill."}
{"text":"One of the better tap houses with 36 taps and over 100 bottles of various styles. They rotate their suds on tap frequently, service is prompt and quality bar food, especially the wings and many sauces. Also a nice touch is the fresh help yourself to the free popcorn. Many locations in the Cleveland area"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Winking Lizard.  Everything about it is great, the food, the atmosphere, the workers.  You cant go wrong here.  I highly recommend their pizza or wings."}
{"text":"Management is poor. I ordered the vegetable ravioli that they had as a summer special. It came swimming in balsamic vinegar. Usually the vintage is a drizzle. I did not eat and ordered something else. I wasn't expecting it to be taken off the bill, but it would have been nice to get an\" I'm sorry you did not like\" and some type of effort to make experience better. As we sat there, we also noticed other individuals complaining to the manager that the ribs were dry. After working in food service for years, I feel that there should be more of an effort to make customers happy. This is another Brunswick restaurant that will not get my business."}
{"text":"I wish yelp allowed half stars because this place doesn't really deserve a 4, but I wouldn't feel right about giving it a 3.  Of the 4 Winking Lizard's I've been to (Bedford, Independence, Fairlawn) this one is my favorite.  It's in the heart of Peninsula;  which is such an awesome community.   Huge beer selection, great service, cool atmosphere, decent bar food, & a game room featuring shuffleboard and pop-a-shot basketball.  My few complaints include: not enough TVs in the bar area, too many damn kids running around, & the parking situation sucks.   Tip:  If the parking lot is full, try the Towpath Preschool parking lot on N. Locust Street.  In the end, I'd say the positives totally outweigh the negatives."}
{"text":"It was quite busy on a Saturday but service was friendly and fast...our server was very accommodating. We enjoyed the atmosphere and our meals were very good. The only downside was their weak Wi-Fi signal. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. Loads of choices the tour of beers is aweaome, it can be pricey but trying new beers is fun and i dont have to buy a 6 pack or more. And the cellar bar is great! Justin, the barkeep knows how to make preprohibition cocktails!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Lizard for over 10 years. This is my go-to restaurant and I can honestly say I have never had anything \"bad\" on the menu. The steak fries are amazing, the wings are fantastic, the selection of beer can't be beat. I also love their salads, burgers ... everything!   Yes the parking situation is pretty bad. Come during off-hours to avoid the parking bottleneck."}
{"text":"First a rant re: a goofy dumbass cheap corporate policy: as of July 27th: in addition to charging you $0.50 for each two-ounce cup of extra salsa for their Mexican dishes, $0.40 for extra wing sauce, etc, the cheapskates at the Lizard are now charging $0.80 for each extra 2-3 oz of salad dressing. SUpposedly have \"always been doing it\" but never encountered it until this week in Peninsula--maybe the wait staff, being customer-oriented, have been evading this ridiculous policy. How many other restaurants do this? It is illogical; dressing for salads is like ketchup for fries, and some people use more while others use less, but no one is charged by the oz. Salsa is like ketchup for chips and mexican dishes. Their policy is not even internally consistent: hog up the ketchup and BBQ sauce for free if you want, but get out your checkbook if you actually want to see sauce on your buffalo wings. Suggest that others annoyed by this also rant, and better still, complain to the managers. As for me, I'm cutting back on my usual weekly visits and boycotting their salads.  The rest of the review: One of  a local chain, this branch is located in the scenic Cuyahoga Valley in a cute & tiny town. Lots of atmosphere in its old roadhouse setting. Occasional live music. Bar is active and loud--not a good place for conversation (or families unless they like lots of stimulation). Come between lunch and dinner hours if you want a quieter environment (though hostesses tend then to push guests to sit in the bar whether one wants that or not; assert yourself to get the eating ambiance you prefer).  Nice little patio but not a particularly scenic one given it's right on the parking lot. Lines can get long in the summer on weekends (Fishers across the street is a good alternative if you don't want to wait). SItting in the front window area is best if you are interested in scenery and local color.  Food is consistent and of good quality, but not always a good value in terms of pricing. Lunch and dinner specials are the best values. Much of the food I'd describe as basic bar food, although there are some excellent (if perhaps overpriced) salads. Their BBQ sauce is popular hereabouts and superior to national chains, but not really authentic pit-style BBQ. Excellent beer selection--a strength. Burgers are basic, flavorful and large but lacking the extra touches like toasted buns. Nice menu variety--something for everyone (although not so much for vegans). Staff are friendly and helpful but service can sometimes be variable.   Note: To be fair, however, I would consider some of the reviews posted here to be overly critical and not representative of my typical experience here. I am a fussy regular and not an enamored fan who lacks objectivity, but I easily find enough to like here to come 2-3 times a month, or did until they went cheapo on the sauces (see introductory rant)."}
{"text":"I ordered a mild sauce wing, and it came out as extra spicy.  He brought me a new order, but I was surprised to see that he charged me for both when I got the bill. Plus, their ranch comes in a plastic packet... Step it up winking lizard, I'm less than impressed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Husband had Cuban burger, said it was very good. I had boneless wings and Beef Tortellini Soup. Wings were good, house ranch was awesome. Did not like soup, was more like Tortellini's in a very thick Beef flavored gravy. Overall food was good. We would eat here again."}
{"text":"Dining at this location is like playing meal roulette.  You really don't know what you're going to get, so take your chances.  Even my 6 year old doesn't like coming here because \"they always get my order wrong\".  Order wings with hot sauce - they come plain.  Like just a fried Wing with absolutely nothing on it.  Delicious.  Somehow the options for kids meals are interchangeable because order one and you something totally different.  Takeout is the same - always something missing or wrong."}
{"text":"I live close to this place, and it's the only decent place around. But it's an inconvenience when I try coming here after a work day with friends under 21. The place is pretty dirty, and the service is awful-such a rude staff and rude people in general. Honestly hate going here."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and loved it more each time i went. Right when i walked in they have a free popcorn that was impressive. The price was pretty good and service was very good every time. Ive had from amazing wings to great pizzas and some pretty good burgers i recommend this to anyone. Probably my favorite restaurant ever!!"}
{"text":"We passed through Mentor on our way to Niagara Falls looking for some local vittles. Was a Thursday and whoohooo $5.99 burger night. We were seated right away (was around 6pm). The server was fantastic - very knowledgable and friendly and suggested an appetizer of southwest 'eggrolls'. Was extremely good, the new soda anyway you want it feature is always a good thing - raspberry coke zero, dont know why its not bottled and only fountain. Anyway I had a maui maui burger w/grilled pineapple and teriaki and was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. I would definitely make a trip back on a road trip! Hats off to the local lizard!"}
{"text":"The lizard is by far one of my favorite places to go in town, most people have never heard of it, especially if they're from out of town but this local chain is slowly spreading and I hope it continues to do so. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at any of their locations but my absolute favorite thing to get here is the white pizza with pepperoni. I could eat it every day. The wings they serve are amazing also, and there are so many flavors you will not easily get tired of any one of them. If you're coming from out of town, I highly recommend stopping in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Thank you Winking Lizard Corporate for making my decision to reduce my patronage of your establishment that much easier. Our family was excited when the Brunswick Winking Lizard (WLB) opened and it has become a regular, almost weekly, sometimes daily, choice for us to enjoy great service and good food in our area.  However, after experiencing your recent menu changes (which we knew were coming but not to the extent they have) we decided this evening to sharply reduce our patronage. We have made good friends in the staff of WLB with them almost all knowing our likes, dislikes, sharing family stories and really feeling like this was a true local establishment.  You can then understand why we were so surprised to find that you made major changes and eliminations to the menu items which were based more on your chain as a whole and not on the local flavors and desires of your patrons. Obviously the people in one area may not enjoy an item to the extent another does but using average data to deny all patrons those items seems a bit short sighted.  This evening we literally sat down for a meal we would otherwise have greatly enjoyed only to order sodas, one appetizer and make the decision to leave because there was literally multiple menu choices we normally enjoy removed from the menu. One, two items.. sure.. but eliminating enough items to cause an entire party to decide there was nothing there for them? You might want to look into that.  What really stuck me as darkly humorous was how happy our server was to tell us that we could now order wings in packs of FIVE instead of SIX! While this makes them easier to count, once you realize they're still the same price you realize it's more about maintaining or increasing your profit margin than it is about \"ensuring the freshest food for our customers.\"  I think I finally understand why the Lizard is Winking at it's customers.  So, best of luck with your new menu, I'm sure those who can't get a seat at the always crowded Panini's up the block will still need somewhere to overflow to. I hope the penny-wise and pound-foolish approach works for you. It will be sad to see another abandoned space in an Ohio strip mall."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a bite to eat. The Winking Lizard serves a variety of different food, based around American bar food. The wings are what they're known for. They have a great atmosphere and are family friendly. They have a game room full of video games. There are several TV's scattered throughout and a happening bar sits as the center of attention. Every couple of months, they have a different specials menu with food only found on the specials menu. There is a patio overlooking the greenery of the Cuyahoga Valley. You would be able to see the river if it wasn't for the trees.  This place is highly recommended for families and those wanting a quick bite to eat after a day of recreation in the Cuyahoga Valley."}
{"text":"I've travelled around the States a fair bit, but I'd never heard of this place - part of a chain of American-style taverns scattered around Ohio. I was pleasantly surprised.  The TVs are tuned to a number of sports stations, and the sheer amount of STUFF covering every conceivable surface adds to the sensory overload, but this merely impresses more of the Americana-charm.  I had a burger. It's rare for an establishment such as this to ask how you'd like your burger cooked, much more so for them to actually get it right, but they did on both counts. I had a delicious Guinness-soaked burger, cooked medium, and, because I hadn't had enough alcohol, chose a local beer from their extensive selection.  This is a relaxed, friendly, and charming place. Plus, there are arcade games, a real lizard, oh, and did I mention the free popcorn? Great fun for all the family."}
{"text":"Planing on a new experience, all of the reviews here are old. Will give an honest review next week."}
{"text":"Good location. Great draft selection.  Food ok.   Service not so good.  I agree with Tom C's review.  Good place to meet friends for a beverage ....watching the U.S. Open on one of the many screens.  Food could be a lot better.   So could the service.   Since I am waiting alone, I have been ignored for 30 minutes.  Guess I'll have some free popcorn...."}
{"text":"It ain't no downtown Winkin' Lizard...  ...But there is something comforting about coming down Rt 20 and seeing that sultry son of a bi7ch giving you the eye. The winkin' eye.  Beer's and liquor galore but whats more, is the glass you can take home with you. Each month features a beer and shooter of the month in which you get to keep the glass. I highly recommend going during September when they have their Oktoberfest glass. A mighty mug for you to chug in which will have your friends calling a cab, bub.   But why does it only get 3 stars? The food. It's there, but not a reason to go there. If anything, its the best place for your last stop on a night out. Their grilled cheese (add bacon and tomato for a small price more) is still under $4 comes with a side and probably the best outside of mom's kitchen I ever had.  Never be afraid you won't see 'the game' because I think the reason Circuit City went out of business is that The Wink bought all their TV's and they couldn't restock fast enough.  Be sure to say \"Hi\" to their in house Iguana, one in which all Winks have before you saddle up to the bar and order a pint on me."}
{"text":"If you want a bar with great food, Winking Lizard is the place for it. There are several of these in the greater Cleveland area but the Wink in Peninsula is by far my favorite. Cute town and good atmosphere with the Wink's always impressive beer selection."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Our waitress was unfamiliar with the special and told they did not have baby back ribs. I told her they were on the special board and she said she would check the seasonal menu ( if they were on there I would not have to ask about them). If people don't like to perform well at their jobs stay home. The service industry is in a sad state. Please read other reviews before you try this place."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable place... The patio is usually quiet and it's really nice in the summer.. Great to meet friends and just hang out.."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard is a wonderful place for food, drinks, and great times.  Your event will begin with friendly hostesses at the door and free popcorn 5 feet away.  This location is broken up into 4 different sections.  The Bar, with lots of high top tables (perfect for watching the big game), a Dining Room with both booths and tables, a heated outdoor bar (full service all year long) and the Patio for those warm summer nights.  They run food and beer specials pretty much all week long (wings, burgers, ribs, pizza and Domestics)  and have the largest beer selections I have every seen.  With monthly draft changes, and Glass of the month specials, you could go almost everyday and never drink the same beer twice.  There are flat panel TV's everywhere, a small game room (including skee ball) and 2011 is the 25th Anniversery of The Lizard, (originally opened in Penninusla, Ohio) although they've only been in Brunswick for a couple of years now, so join the World Tour of Beers, have some wings (I recommend the Goldfinger), and enjoy!"}
{"text":"good food, nothing special except their bbq sauce which is utterly my fav. its a chain, but a local one at that with a better than average beer selection. enough said?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood sports bar.  The pizza, wings and quesadillas are all the best around.  The atmosphere is similar to that of any sports bar, but with quirkiness."}
{"text":"I went to the Winking Lizard last night to watch the first Indian's playoff game.  There were gong to be 14 of us, so my husband stopped in to see if they could accommodate us.  He spoke to Joe, the General Manager, who actually remembered our group last year because we watched almost every playoff game there.  Joe did a great job.  When we arrived at 6:00, everything was all set up for us.  Kim, our waitress, was also great.  The food was very good and the beer was cold (so many to choose from).  We will be back for more games!"}
{"text":"Took way too long for everything. Good beer and wing selection but that is about it. Super noisy, server was ok, nothing to wrote home about. Was never checked on once we got our food. Won't be stopping back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ok. I eat at a winking lizard once a week or so because I do there World tour of beers. You sign up, drink different beers and get a gift at milestones like 50 and 100. It does get expensive but if you're like me and want to try all the different beers anyway this is kind of cool. The food is good, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza and wings for the most part. Service is pretty good at this location but I have no knowledge about the rest of them as I usually eat at this one. As mentioned in other reviews parking can be a bear.  They have outdoor seating but you can't smoke there.  Just a heads up. Oh, FREE popcorn."}
{"text":"Standard bar food offerings. The boneless wings leave quite a bit to be desired, but the burgers  are pretty darned good. What makes this bar/restaurant worth trying is their superb beer list; there is a ton of variety (but too many IPAs for my taste) from quite a few countries.   Service is seemingly hit or miss. Mix between good and terrible servers seems to be about 50-50%."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that the Winking Lizard has completely gone down hill the last few years, and after many years of going there, I probably won't go back. Went there for a birthday party with about 15 friends, and to watch the Browns game. In the 3 hours I was there it took anywhere from 15 minutes to a half hour to get a beer, and we were sitting at the bar!! Very few people in there, so this made no sense. Almost walked out without paying as we could not even get our checks! Terrible service, just terrible."}
{"text":"I work for about 14 months but I have to say it was a great job! Then I want to try a lot of the food and it is so good."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Would not recommend. Server did not acknowledge or apologize for 2 burger orders taking 30mins! I mean there was only 5 tables in the whole restaurant, including us!!! No excuse! Server name Em. Serious thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Monday and Tuesday nights are wing nights. Check it out! They have a huge selection of wing flavors and a GIANT beer list. My wife and I love the pizza here as well. The environment is laid back. The restaurant is often busy but service has been great in both the bar area and the dining room at the front of the restaurant. Give the lizard a shot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This was is your typical bar food restaurant. My wife ordered a cocktail which was very weak. Our fish tacos were horrible. My daughters hamburger was okay at best. At least they have a great beer selection. The manager did take the tacos off of the bill, but I left hungry. And coincidentally, I got the runs the next morning."}
{"text":"Racist manager, will never ever. Give my money o somebody who does not welcome you"}
{"text":"We came here a few times while in town on business. The place has lots of TVs and tons of beers on tap. We came on Monday and Tuesday, both of which were half price wings. The wings were crispy, and perfectly cooked.  We got hot, garlic, and spicy garlic. The spicy garlic was the tastiest of the bunch, and my only complaint is that the hot wasn't that hot.  They had great beer specials, and both of the bartenders were great fun. I would definitely return to the lizard."}
{"text":"I like this Winking Lizard mostly because of Location! Location! Location! In the fall, their is nothing better than a hike/walk/ride through Peninsula."}
{"text":"Love the food, have had a few bad servers but, usually a great time. Often we call ahead and get it to go."}
{"text":"Been here several times I never considered this close to the original Winking Lizard in terms of food or atmosphere sometime you just can't copy the original. I found the service leaves a little to be desired and the food is average at best located in a strip mall it just doesn't have much appeal it has always been busy but considering the choices in the immediate area and I understand why. I would never go out of my way to come here I would stop in for a few drinks with friends then go somewhere else for food. It can get a little loud at times."}
{"text":"For being a neighborhood watering hole in a strip mall, this winking lizard has more character than you'd expect. I met a friend here for her Thursday night skee ball league. Yes, they have that here, and I'm pretty sure all of the Winking Lizards have skee ball leagues. All deserve at least 3 stars for that alone. The great beer (and gluten free beer) selection gives it another star. It was hopping for a Thursday in the burbs. The server hussled and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Generic fried food, burgers.   Lots of Beers.  Loud.   TVs.  That about sums it up."}
{"text":"Wow! The food & drinks were amazing! The atmosphere was incredible albeit we were there for Game 2 of the ALCS....Go Tribe!! The large selection of beers and diverse food menu for the pricing was perfect for just a night out on the town and a huge change of pace from you typical Chili's or Applebees experience."}
{"text":"My family members and my self had Lunch today Friday September 27,2013 and we were never greeted by the hostess, waited around for 5 minutes. To be honest just doing this review My head and my ears Hurt so bad that i am not sure if i can ever go back. It was So noisy, Loud that you can not carry on a normal conversation with out yelling and hearing someone else in your party, We had kids off ages running around past your table why you were trying to enjoy your food and eat on top of other people eating as well.      To be honest as well the hostess/manager  sat party of 3 in the bar area which their was a dinning room across the hall and out door seating but no they sat us in the bar area.  After my first time experience i will never go back to this location ever again i already contacted management and waiting for a response."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The Winking Lizard.  However, never got to try this one because the brain dead hostess just couldn't seem to get us seated.  After every party that got seated, she would tell us we were next.  This madness went on for 45 minutes until we left.  If you see some snotty 20 year old at the hostess stand, god help you.   We went on up to the new Wink on Rockside Road and had a delightful time.  I don't get it."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place that I know of that has really good wings. Depending on who works at the time you can always count on good service."}
{"text":"Very good meal at a reasonable price.  Big salad.  It's a sports bar so it is hard to have a conversation"}
{"text":"Visited from out of town and my business acquaintance took me here to watch the Cavs game. Great service, full bar and lots of beers on tap. There are plentiful TV screens behind the bar area to watch the games on and lots of seating which made it much more appealing than the always over-packed and crowded Buffalo Wild Wings down the road."}
{"text":"We use to go here when I was a kid. I can't wait to get back someday.. excellent food and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I would never go out of my way to come here, but it's the better of the two restaurants available in Peninsula - if you're on the train and get off here, you're limited on your dining options.  This is the better of the two restaurants available - more room to spread out, larger menu, etc. The food was pretty good and priced well. We loved the brownie ice cream sundae! I'm sure during the warmer months, the patio would be very nice. We did have about a 15 minute wait, and I imagine the restaurant gets pretty busy as it gets warmer. The iguana is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"generally, i think Winking Lizard is just OK, though i do like the Brunswick one a little better than most.  WL has a tremendous beer selection. the food can be anywhere from disappointing (pizza) to really good (BBQ Pork sandwich and the wings). really, it's the food that keeps me from wanting to go there it's just seems more miss than hit. there's also the fact that they're always packed it seems. for business owners, this is great. for a guy like me, not so much. i like it a little quiet from time to time.  anyway, like i said, WL is OK and i'll certainly go there again to get some good beer. you owe it to yourself to at least do that much."}
{"text":"What a fun place for family dinners. I have gone here several times both for lunches as well as dinner carry out.  The place is really big so we rarely have to wait did a seat. Also they have a lot of fun games and the lizard to keep the kiddos entertained which is great!!    LOVE the buffalo chix salad. (But beware they charge fit any extra side of dressing if hit sauce. They also charge more for grilled over fried chicken). Love the veggie wrap as well. And the Maui Maui chicken sandwich is awesome!  If you carry out be sure to triple check everything as they tend to get mixed communications back to the kitchen. Also if getting a chicken sandwich we always ask did the bin on the side otherwise it tends to get a soggy bottom bun."}
{"text":"This place is great at all times of the year, but especially SUMMER/SPRING!!! The outside seating area is nice.  The beer selection is HUGE!!!  The pizzas are GREAT!  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!    It's kid friendly before 7 o clock ish and the food is good enough for a real meal.  They have a very good selection of beers, I'm guessing 40 plus kinds?  Definitely a must stop if you're staying in the Akron/Fairlawn/Peninsula area.  From what the people around here say it's the best of the local Winking Lizard chain.  (In reply to the person who said it's loud: Seriously???  This is a bar.  If you want quiet, then go to some place other than... I don't know... a bar?"}
{"text":"For what it is, a casual bar on a bike path, I think it's done well. Excellent service, great beer selection, mildly decent bourbon list, and good (but not great) bar food. I can see how this place could be nostalgic for locals; however, not being one and just traveling through, I wasn't super impressed. Also if I were on a long, multi-day bike ride and happened to stop here for a break, my rating would be catapulted to a strong 5.  So if you're looking for a chill night out with great food and adult beverages, I'd go with a 3 (in fact, I'd go with a 2 if this was not jettisoned in the food desert that is Ohio). If you're a desperate recreationer starved for indulgence Americana style, I'd give it a 5 - Winking Lizard should definitely be on the agenda for planned breaks along the path."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic service was great never had a glass empty. I absolutely come back definitely above average beer selection."}
{"text":"Our experience at the lizard was very under  under whelming the bartender ignored us all night. Wait 30 minutes for a drink we ordered 15 mild wings. 30 minutes later no wings. The bartender said we ordered 15 minutes ago. After 45 minutes we had our wings. Order was wrong. 5 were hot wings. Bartender again argued with us. I told him I did not want the hot wings. He opened the box , stuck his nose in them to smell. Yuk yuk yuk. Didn't want them at all. Really bad service on the patio. Not recommend will not be back."}
{"text":"Worst. Experience. Ever.  While waiting for our food (it was a first date), our server was bumped into and a number of draft beers were spilled onto me.  My top and jeans were not just wet, they were drenched.  Additionally, my cell phone was in my back pocket so it was also soaked in beer.  I'm still hoping that by drying it out, it will begin working appropriately.  Another server then stepped on one of the fallen glasses and the glass flew across the floor at my legs.  What occurred after this incident is why I am truly dissatisfied with the service and response from management.  The manager came over after the floor was cleaned up.  He offered to buy me a beer to remedy the situation.  That was not nearly enough in my opinion and I had no intention of even having a second beer that night anyway and I think a $3 beer was a highly inappropriate offer, given what had transpired.  Then he offered dessert but I had no intentions of getting that either.  I then had to tell him to comp my meal.  This whole situation truly soured our evening out.  I found it insulting that I had to ask the manager to comp my meal.  He should have taken care of the expense of me and my date for the night give that it was extremely disruptive to our night.    I'm a fan of Winking Lizard's typically, but this experience was simply horrible..."}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch here after riding the Cuyahoga Valley Line Railroad for a few hours. The wait to get a table was long, but worth it in the end.   Service:  Our server was friendly but could have been more attentive. We had to ask for napkins and silverware from another passing employee. Food came out fast enough considering how busy they were.   Spicy BBQ Chicken Wings: Not too spicy, but still had a good kick. The flavor was a good as any other wings I've had lately. Definitely recommended.   Bacon Cheeseburger: Was cooked as ordered and had a good flavor. The burger wasn't to dry and it was big enough to fill me up. Served with a side of steak fries. I'm not usually a steak fry fan, but these were good enough to keep me munching.    Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this if you're in the area if you're ok with a long wait."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers.  There beer club does not work for people passing through like myself.  The beers were good and the bartender was nice and even cleaned the bottles for me since I collect beer bottles so I could take them with me."}
{"text":"Went this past Monday for wing night and was disappointed. Had traditional wings and they were real little and the dry rub Cajun had zero flavor. The boneless wings were also very small. If your wholesaler delivered you a small batch of wings the least you could do is inform your customer or give them a few extra. I still gave it a 3 star because of the service, atmosphere and decor. I will go back but never again for the wings."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped for lunch. Excellent beer selection. I had the steak and cheese, and she had the large order of loaded fries. Both were delicious. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"I love the Wink, and I especially love that this one was right across from the bicycle shop where my friends and I started our Towpath bike adventure.  After 14 miles on that lovely path, it was great to have good food so close by.  As always, the first order of business was to go say hi to the lizard.  I've forgotten this one's name (Heisman, maybe? Something weird like that...), but he was sufficiently adorable and made my lizard-loving husband reiterate his wish for a giant terrarium.  Then it was food time!  I had a hard time choosing between all the delicious protein-ful sandwiches, but I ended up with a BBQ pulled chicken and gouda sandwich that was exactly what I didn't know I needed.  I ended up bequeathing the second half of my sandwich to a hungry husband, but I'll always remember that first half. :)  On the drinks side, I was sad not to find anything that sounded especially exciting on the draft beer list, but I was consoled by the existence of a Coke Freestyle machine and therefore endless Fanta Zero.  Mmm, Fanta Zero.  And the best benefit, free wifi!  With my phone's poor signal in town, it was nice to be able to get my email and social media ready for the ride back to my friends' place.  Now that I know that this Towpath-Wink combination exists, you can bet I'll be back here for both the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"So my wife and I and our 18mo old just left here after wing night and we were thoroughly disappointed. Let me preface by saying we have been coming here almost once a month for the past couple of years and have never really had any major issues. The food and service is usually ok except for the last two times. My issue tonight was the service and feeling like we were being scolded by the waitress on their \"no doggy bag policy\" as she says. We have never had a problem taking home our 2 or 3 leftover wings ever until we've had this same waitress the last two times. It's stupid...we don't order excessive amounts and try to take home 30 wings. Pizzas are 1/2 price also on Monday's and guess what...our 18mo old loves cheese pizza...but if we order him a small we can't take home the other 4 pieces that he doesn't eat that we  paid for! They would rather throw it in the garbage. This is a horrible policy to make people feel like criminals for wanting to take their leftovers home. Once again it's not like we have or will ever order way too much food and expect to take it home...that's not right but neither is this no doggy bag policy.   The next issue was the service which kind of also plays into the doggy bag policy as we observed our waitress giving a gentleman a takeout box to pack up his kids 5 leftover wings. We asked him about it and he said that she said that she shouldn't do it but be discreet about it. He then proceeded to tell her we asked him and we didn't see her for another 20mins...she visited every table around us, we clearly needed refills and maybe an update on why we were still waiting on our food 40mins later(another story). Finally the food came out cold and we had to ask the food runner for refills to which he politely obliged. By this point we were fed up. The food, service, and being scolded over taking leftovers home was enough. We have never had a problem on wing night with any other waitress when it came to getting a box to take our 3 or 4 leftover wings, but this time was too much. I was actually praying we wouldn't get this woman as our waitress before we walked in and sure enough...we did. I usually tip at least 20% on the total, tax included but tonight was 15% on the pre-tax total. It was that bad and for that we will never go back.  @winking Lizard you need to private message me, I can't message you. Thanks."}
{"text":"Other locations are better run with more parking and would rate higher. Staff is friendly but hard to get. Huge props for bringing Vedett beer to America- only place you can get it!!!  Wings are standard - prob here for beer and ambiance (its roadhouse-esque) I was sat near a bunch of families while other more adult tables were available at 5:45 on a Friday night. Go to another Lizard and order a Vedett Extra White!!"}
{"text":"After a long day didn't feel like cooking so I called and ordered carry out ,got home opened up my Burger  and of course fries are cold but bit into my Burger and it was RAW !!! not red but raw opened it up and it looks like the cooked it on each side long enough to look cooked on one side you can tell it fell apart while cooking ! My son and I where in a while back and ordered burgers and it was polar opposite medium was cooked to beyond well done. Last time I will ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"After living in Arizona for 4 years, I still think about this place! Miss it so much. They have the best cheese fries here. Plus who doesn't love getting to see the lizard every time you visit!? Awesome atmosphere. I hope to come back here soon this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Always my favorite stop when I'm in town. Peninsula location is my fave. Best atmosphere, beer selections and pub grub around...even the salads are extreme!!   Always order several appetizers to share and start with then we move on to the real menu items. We have fun ordering different things then sharing them together. The rings and wings are a must and the HANGOVER burger is amazing with the spicy mayo. Oh, dont forget the fried pickles either. They are thicker cut with perfect pickle/batter ratio and always served hot! They pair well with most beers too!!  Stop in and stay a while. The wait is worth it and hope to get another round of the WINK before heading back to Texas!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent! I have come here many times with a large group (15+) and they always accommodate us very well. The beer selection is unrivaled, and the food here is some of the best bar food I've ever had. Everything from the wings, sandwiches, burgers, is excellent, the menu is quite diverse and there's always several seasonal selections going on."}
{"text":"We had a great server.  I can tell you the food is good, but not fabulous, go out of our way good.  The flight of beer option allowed us to try odd named beers (with a Halloween theme). I do like the barbeque sauce, we brought some home.  This is a good place to go if you don't know what you want - many options.  I had the barbeque ribs - which i have to say was good and my husband had the steak.  The steak lacked flavor even after we had sent the food back to the chef.  We did enjoy the loaded fries and roasted veges."}
{"text":"This place was great. Brisket sandwich and the bbq chicken melt we're both excellent and the beer list is huge. Awesome outdoor bar and patio as well. Service was fast and friendly and when we're back in town we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Lizard I so love you but could you please banish the lettuce eating, whiney, I have 10 kids and not paying attention to any of them, sipping specialty craft beer, to their own bicycling riding corner????"}
{"text":"I have been to several Winking Lizard Taverns across Northeast Ohio, and the Bar/Restaurant in Mentor, is the best by far (IMO). The bar staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the craft beer selection, which totals about 300!  A plus is the free self-serve popcorn with unlimited refills, although it is on the salty side, it's a nice snack to munch on at the bar. I ordered the loaded nachos as an appetizer and later the white pizza with jalapeno peppers. Both entrees were fresh, hot and well portioned. You will come for the beer and stay for the comfort foods, which are priced reasonably and served timely. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for business when I went here with some coworkers for dinner and a few drinks. There was a laid back atmosphere and the staff was friendly. Great wings and huge selection of beer. While not being too touristy or gimmicky, this place maintains the smaller chain family owned feel which is nice.  Overall, good experience here."}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer list + 1 star for the food divided by two gives me a 3 overall.  And this goes for all locations, because they are all the same on the inside - although I like this location best because of its backdrop of the national park.  On a winter's day, you can actually cross country ski to the door, and pop in for a cold pint...Borderline sublime experience that can almost give you your \"ski village\" fix if you are missing Colorado.    As for the restaurant itself:  It is what it is.  A place to find bonafide IPA on draft, with a menu that consists of a grab bag of items from the Sysco food truck unimaginatively dropped into a fryer or thrown en masse onto a flat top grill.   Peninsula doesn't have many food options around, so if you are hungry, go to the Lizard, order a full bodied beer, and look for the least-worst thing on the menu.  Good luck."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of the Winking Lizard but after two bad meals here and the slowest bar service with a cocky bartender I'll never come back. There's too many great places nearby that actually are less expensive anyway. I can't get over the bartenders here, all the ones I've had are completely arrogant... why is that? Cashing out between weird shifts constantly, as a customer I hate that. How about cashing out when the customer leaves, once? Anyway, two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Normally I would have given this place a 5 star review...however.... the last  3 visits have proven otherwise.  We eat at this restaurant very frequently,  im talking about 5 times or more per month. Today  I walked into 4 hostesses and a manager at  the entrance and not one of them acknowledged me. Another family walked in behind me and were asked right away if they needed a table, at that point I had to speak up and only one hostess says \"oh sorry!\" Last week when I came the food was just not great and the previous time, my dinner came out 20min past my family's meals and when I took the first bite,  the center was completely frozen! Luckily the manager took care of it that day. Im very upset at this place going down hill and I feel bad that they are going to lose our on my family as customers, as we were there so much."}
{"text":"Went hiking with my grandma and she said she had never been to The Winking Lizard so we decided to go there. The service was great and so was the food. My grandmother had a great time as well"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, great food and service!  They have at least 100 beers available - around 20 on tap (sign up for the \"world beer tour\").  Lots of monthly specials:  we got a bucket - 5 - of Mexican beers (not the usual stuff), t-shirt and bottle opener for like $2.50/beer . . . and a couple of very cool keepsake STONE LEVITATION ALE glasses.  Our server was helpful in suggesting beers (she told us they are all required to sample a few beers so they can best describe to customers - how do I get a job here?!).  Food is good - we had wings, rings and some sammiches."}
{"text":"Pros: Amazing beer selection, shuffleboard, popcorn, and a boss lizard.  Cons: Food is subpar bar food.  I've had good and bad service, it depends on the waitress. Fun to go if you want to try a new beer - but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"It is very nice that it is a stop right off of the train. So if you are bored on the train then this is the place to come.  It's pretty much just like all the other winking Lizards. It has a good beer selection but the food is not so good. We got the po-boys in honor of Mardi Gras and they were not so good. Every time I have been to one of these the food is off."}
{"text":"Take a rest from hiking to enjoy some grease!  THE UP-SIDE:  There's not much to choose from in Peninsula, Ohio.  Thankfully, they have a Winking Lizard just off the Cuyahoga Valley recreational tow path trail.  As such, this place is usually crammed full of family-folk looking to have some greasy bar food and take a break from all the walking or biking.     THE DOWN-SIDE:  The food is just bar food, and nothing more.  While I normally don't mind that type of food, it would be incredible if a restaurant could open up by the tow path that served healthy, non-greasy, food.  I guarantee that people would be happy to take a break from the physical fitness stuff for something more healthy to eat.    THE SUM-IT-UP:  This is the only lively and consistent restaurant/bar in Peninsula.  It's not bad, but it isn't great by any means.  Mostly, it's just a stop for tired people from the tow path trail."}
{"text":"I get wings and drinks here most Mondays with my dad. The atmosphere is great, the staff is always personable, and the food is amazing.  If I could complain about anything, parking can be an issue on their busier nights. As long as you're semi-familiar with the area and okay with potentially having to walk to get some great food, there's no reason this establishment and everyone who works there isn't worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Can't quite give you four stars, but this is definitely my favorite location of the Cleveland-area chain and a standby which has beckoned me back at least several dozen times!  Let me start by saying that I was terribly disappointed when management decided to remove the vintage bar from the front room effectively killing much of the historic ambiance that came with visiting the old 'Peninsula Nite Club'. What was left was a historic shell surrounding a fairly standard sports bar atmosphere. I do enjoy the huge U-shaped bar in the ballroom area, but it doesn't come close to what used to be. I'm sure it was all about increasing capacity, but I still had to say my piece.  That said, I still love returning to Winking Lizard and this location specifically. Now that I live out of state, heading down the the Valley to meet friends returning to NE Ohio over the holidays has been an annual tradition for at least 15 years. An inimitable beer list (there's my three stars) is a huge draw and the food is always pretty solid for 'pub grub' taken up half a notch. Free popcorn is a huge plus for any place and certainly pays dividends as free salty snacks lead me directly to the beer taps.  Favorites include the Bo-Man's sandwiches, wings and virtually anything doused in their signature barbecue sauce. I buy multiple bottles to take back to Chicago. Just don't read the Nutrition Facts as I'm amazed that a barbecue sauce could be so bad for you! :)  Keep it up, Winking Lizard! You're like a trusty friend who's pissed me off a few times, but I keep coming back because I love ya!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of all winking lizards but I feel like this one is always the best. We stopped in for lunch to break up a ride on the tow path. The patio is nice. Good vibes. Our server knew her beer as my fiancée had some questions when it came to picking one. I had the spicy garlic traditional wings. Pretty nice kick and flavor, perfectly cooked with a slight crisp. She had a fish sandwich and enjoyed. Love it - good work guys."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me on Halloween with big bucket of wings. We both have patronized the Lizard for years and have usually always had a good meal. The wings we had that night were bland and lacked any flavor. These were sorry wings. I had to mix up some of my own wing sauce to half way enjoy them. I'm not sure if it was the night and the staff was pissed they had to work or what. The lizard in Mentor needs to take notice as Quaker Steak and BW3 are always good or they will lose my business."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting this WL location and was just as disappointed the 2nd time as the first. Ordered take-out, veggie burger & 10 traditional wings. Hostess said food would be ready in 20 minutes... It took 35 minutes. The hostesses were very sweet, they kept running to the kitchen to check on the food & would report that they were just waiting on the burger. Usually wouldn't care that it took extra time but after opening my meal up after we arrived home I couldn't believe that the wings were dried out and the burger was burnt. The first time we were there, we ate at the bar... The bar service wasn't bad, but again, the food was terrible.  I will definitely not order food from here again and will probably try out a different bar when thirsty."}
{"text":"The Caribbean spice wings are the best thing on the menu, fried pickles are great as well as the burgers"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 13-February-2017 Time of my visit: Dinner  After my earlier fiasco at another joint, I called this one to find out if they had ribs and they did, St. Louis Style Ribs.  Awesome!  As it turned out, this joint is a chain, but it looks like it's limited to OH, but at that point, I just wanted ribs.  I got in, was seated, my waitress came over and took my drink order.  After bringing my drink, I ordered the ribs.  I had a choice between regular BBQ sauce and spicy, I opted out for the regular one.  It did not take long for the ribs to come out.  They came with stake fries and coleslaw.  The stake fries were pretty good, but nothing over the top special as was the coleslaw.  The ribs were about average, but I was not expecting it to be \"oh my gosh!\", but the nice thing was they came out individually cut, so someone in the kitchen cut each rib, which I thought was nice.  Service was slightly disappointing, as my waitress was paying more attention to her bigger (party numbers wise) tables than me.  There had been several times, I was without a refill and it took her awhile to come around.  Overall a C- experience.  Probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"Good sports bar. All American food. Good selection of wings and burgers. Quick friendly service. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Typical bar food... One day service and food is good the next time you don't go back for a year. For some reason employees still sit families with children between 2 days and 4 years old on the bar side. Most of the time  bar side has a Chucky e cheese atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place for families to take there kids ! The have games of course the lizard is there in his cage. One thing happens ever time in order salmon ! It comes out not cooked. So if you go here order what you should order at a able wings fried food and burgers !!!"}
{"text":"Lunch Review   I didn't have my phone with me during my solo errand day to capture this place almost empty... The floor is actually in good shape... never could notice it before :-)   I have been coming here for many many years... newsflash to out of county folk... this isn't a new location... by any means! The service is always friendly and when it isn't fast they warn you... did I mention that it gets PACKED in there many nights?   I don't know what bars other reviewers go to... but the fact that they fill the back of the paper place mat with the listing of all the beers (another reason to take a camera at all times!) makes it not the average bar to me.   The soups of the day were Chicken Dumpling and Italian Wedding. I seem to be attracting IW these days so I decided to give the weekly salad special and a cup of soup a try. So the hubby didn't feel left out I took a slice of Key Lime Cheesecake home.   Italian Wedding Soup - good chicken flavor to the broth, carrot celery chunks as big as the meatballs... which tasted and felt like Spaghetti O's meatballs of my youth... it made me giggle.   Layered Chicken Salad - Fresh cold peas, chopped hard boiled egg, baby spinach, iceberg and some sort of shredded Colby that didn't taste natural. The dressing was sour cream, mayo and a small bit of sugar... it was like a summer pasta salad with lettuce instead. I couldn't even finish half. The waitress asked if I wanted a to go serving of dressing when I asked for a box... nice touch!   Key Lime Cheesecake - Tangy New York style with a graham crust. It was covered in a thin layer of whipped cream and some toasted coconut that seemed out of place, but we would order it again.  We will be back to give the hamburger menu a go :-)"}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations as everyone I know praises the Winking Lizard. And they were right! First of all, I want to steal the iguana. That said, the food was delicious! I got my usual spinach and artichoke dip, and it was some of the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had. Prices were fair, and the decor was really cool! My only complaint is that because I was with my sister and her friend, who were minors, my non minor friend and I were not allowed to drink. I have never heard of any other restaurant having that policy. Overall a pleasant experience, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The pulled chicken melt is the best \"bar food\" type item I've ever eaten. Be sure to ask for spicy bar b q sauce for a little extra kick!  Bartenders are friendly and more importantly, knowledgeable about beers on tap."}
{"text":"I have not been here since I moved out of Ohio but during the time I was living here. this was the place to be during the weekend. To those reading this, I am writing this review for the tiems I visited back in 2009 so this may not be accurate today but I digress.   The styling for the inside has a lovely tavern feel to it and is wonderfully kept up, except for the popcorn area which they give out complementary popcorn to waiters, I was hopeful that it could be cleaned but when I got into the dining area, I didn't dwell on it. I usually went with my family so therefore the first time we went, we got seated right next to the lizard. I was younger at the time so just watching it entertained the hell out of me. There were arcade machines hidden behind the corner which I am not sure are there anymore but they still functioned well and didn't often break; I doubt they were removed.   The service here was excellent....well there was one time we went where our waitress displayed a horrid attitude and was slightly rude. When we came back, she eventually was layed off and the good times returned.  The food here is above the bar for me with the burgers and wings being some of the best in Brunswick has to offer. Prices are pretty low when solo but they become a little more up there if you choose to take a group with you but that shouldn't be a reason to not visit.   Five years have gone by now and this is one of the many places that I hope to stay open when I make my return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food.  Always a great drink selection.  Very good seasonal menus.  This is my go to place.  Eat here normally once or twice a week"}
{"text":"I went to this Winking Lizard location on Saturday and the expierience was not consistant with the previous experiences I've had at the other locations. When we first walked in, we stood there waiting to be aknowledged. There were two ladies at the hostess stand who were just looking at us and finally, after a few awkward moments, they finally asked us how many were in our party. It was strange.   We were then seated in the bar area. If I knew it was going to be that noisy, I would have asked to sit on the other side of the restaurant. The waiter came over and took our drink orders and came back promptly with our beers. We love trying new beers from the lengthy beer list they have.  We then ordered wings and fries. I ordered regular wings with the spicy garlic sauce. My husband ordered boneless wings with a less hot sauce than I ordered. I'm not sure how long it was before we go out food but it felt like forever. When our food did come out, it was ice cold. My husband had also asked for his wing sauce to be on the side and it came out on the wings. After asking the waiter, he brought out a fresh, hot order for my husband. Here's the weird part. Although I ordered sauce that was higher on the spice scale than my husband's, his were 10x hotter! I tried a bite of his and it was like I was breathing fire. It was like drinking battery acid. Luckily, he likes hot wings so he didn't mind the heat but there's no way I would have been able to eat them.   Overall, I feel that this specific location is going downhill. We were there at 3 in the afternoon so they weren't busy. There was really no excuse for the poor quality of our experience. I can't imagine what it's like there when they're packed."}
{"text":"Frequent customer here with my family. Great spot. Always have excellent service and the food is always on point. Reasonable prices and plenty of options for the adults as well as the kids. Our go to restaurant in Brunswick!"}
{"text":"Basically like all the other Winking Lizards (check my review of the other WL for more detail), but this one is probably my favorite. Great location, right off the towpath. Nice outdoor patio with great scenery. They also have a cool little cellar bar that is usually open, but can also be reserved for private parties."}
{"text":"Walked in with my kids and my 70+ year old mother, who walks SLOWLY WITH A CANE. The young girl promptly seats us at the furthest point of the store. After we were seated I walked back to the front and told the young girl that she was stupid for seating us there as it took a lot for my mom to walk all the way back there, idiotic even. 5 minutes later the manager, or so he claimed, asked me to join him in the room where he promptly started yelling at me and told me that I had made the young girl, who I was told, had a learning disability. This was the excuse I was given time and again when my mother was CLEARLY physically challenged, but in his mind, his employee did no wrong.   The food as always was exceptional. WONDERFUL even. However, it was clear that this manager and his employees need serious re training. We'll be going to a different lizard in the future. Not here again."}
{"text":"If you like hiking, the valley is a great place for you.  And you'll have to hike, as the Winking Lizard parking lot only holds a few dozen cars, and a few of those cars appear not to have budged since the place was the Peninsula Night Club during the Crimean War.  The parking math simply does not add up.  Factor in all the private parking surrounding Hunkerville and you'll more than likely end up just staying home rather than risk the merry-go-round search for a place that's legal.  Once you do make it inside, it has that abandoned warehouse feel:  sticky floors, kitch-y decor, a half dozen \"employees\" loitering about.  Our server was great, which explains the second star, but the noise level is such that you'll be inches from her ear and have the following exchange:  \"Do you have a wheat beer?\"  \"Yes we have a Murfle-Burfle-Purfle that is a white beer.\"  So I get one of those ghost-like beers that tastes like someone filled last night's beer glass with lemonade, rather than what I had tried to order.  The food wasn't especially horrible, which is faint praise; I had perch that may just have come from the Kah-Hooga just across the tracks, and downstream of Akron's toilet brush.  The beer selection must be the draw; the place was and probably always is packed with shouting people.  (If I were of dating age and status, this is where I would go if I either had nothing to say to my date, or merely wanted to pretend I was listening while watching one of the seven hundred huge tee-vees hanging from every available rafter.)  I suppose they'll  keep everything just as it is; a full house is the only review most bar owners read.  I can't recommend this dump."}
{"text":"This is a pretty uncomfortable review for me to write, because I really enjoy the winking lizard, the kids enjoy going there, and overall it's a really solid and decent place to grab a bite and a beer. However this night did nothing short of infuriate me and I'll tell you why.   I arrived at the lizard with the kids while my wife is running about 10 minutes behind. Our server was very nice and relatively new by her own admission. I ordered a black and tan which everybody knows is Guinness mixed with another beer and that beer alternates regionally.  The beer came out in an imperial pint glass as Guinness should...but it was 2/3 full.  2/3!  I pointed this out to my relatively inexperienced to server, but she stated oh you have to give it time to settle and it will filll right back up. Now I've been drinking Guinness for quite some time, and it never did quite fill up. I ask the server to go and get the manager so he can correct the pour. The manager on duty did show up and proceeded to tell me that because it was a black and tan, they put it in an imperial glass although they do this so they do not have to wait for the head to settle. Now I am NOT saying the Customer is always right, but you do not serve a beer in a glass two thirds full.  And then proceeded to argue with a customer in front of his kids by telling him he is wrong and the restaurant is right and they're not going to change it.    Naturally, this infuriated me and I asked the server to give me my bill as we're going to get out.  At this time the wife showed up and calmed me down...but now I can't enjoy a meal with an ahole know it  all \"manager\" who's only response to a complaint should have been \"I'll fix that right away sir\".  Piss off lizard.  There's plenty of other choices of places to eat in mentor."}
{"text":"This place isn't too shabby for what it's supposed to be. Nice draft list, huge beer list, okay selection of burbon and whiskey. This establishment is definitely a staple in Peninsula.   The service is always amazing and friendly. I don't think I've ever had bad service here. The food is alright. Basic bar food, but a lot to choose from. I'm not a huge fan of the wings. They always come out soggy and I find them overpriced.   Parking can be a disaster depending on what day/ time you decide to visit. I'd recommend parking down a block or so!"}
{"text":"I had an average experience at Winking Lizard tonight. Though we were seated quickly and our server was friendly and efficient, my food was just mediocre. I ordered 10 wings with garlic sauce. They were fatty and I didn't love the sauce either.   However, the menu was gigantic, so maybe I just ordered the wrong item (though it's hard to believe one restaurant can do all of that stuff well.) I will say, my parents were with me and they both enjoyed their meals: the Mediterranean wrap and the crab cakes.   In summary, I wasn't impressed with my experience here, but it wasn't bad food--just truly average. I wouldn't say that I'll never be back, it just wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"All in all, a pretty not great experience. The food was cold upon arrival, especially the wings and onion rings. Our waiter was a ghost all night, and when it was time for the checks he messed up how we wanted the food split. I ordered the hot wings, which one would think is a safe choice considering the reputation this chain has for their wings. Boy was I mistaken. For the prices, this place really needs to step it the fuck up. If this review can deter even one person from spending their hard earned money at this establishment, then I've done good."}
{"text":"This was my first trip here but I heard about it through friends. They were right... Great place. Great beer list and a nice menu. I had a salad nothing fancy but it was done well and also had some boneless wings that were also good. We had good service and I was pleased with the overall atmosphere of the place. Wish the prices were a little lower but you pay for a good beer list and menu.  Only thing I was not pleased about was it was a little bit loud in there but I can handle that on a busy afternoon. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love the WL in Lakewood its always a good time. The WL in Brunswick is great for atmosphere, drinks and even the service is good, my problem is the food!  Every time I eat here there's something wrong with my food.   I got wings yesterday \"Hot\", well I wouldn't even call them mild.  The Wings were red in color but there was no sauce!  I did ask for some sauce to put on them but it was more of a vinegar flavor.  Any ways maybe some day they will get it right."}
{"text":"With a friendly staff who let us close the place down Friday as the only table and Pere Jacques on draft, I'm a FAN!   Tip. Kitchen closes at 1AM."}
{"text":"I have always liked the Winking Lizard, but this one is by far the best.  I think it's just the atmosphere of the older building and being in downtown Peninsula.  I usually get the buffalo chicken sandwich, but the burgers are good too.  They offer a year long beer tour if thats your thing with a monthly rotating stock of brews.  The wait can get long on the weekends, but thats normal for a popular spot.   If the weather is nice enjoy their patio seating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, plenty of televisions no way you'll miss an event here. Servers very attentive to your needs. Volume is not bad either, you can watch the game and still have a conversation. Great plave for lunch"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some food and beer before the Cavs game and it was kind of packed.  They had a cluster by the front stand and I was having trouble getting my name on the list.  I wish I knew the name of the gentlemen who was so attentive that he noticed the issue and came to my table afterwards to apologize and buy me my first beer.  I have been in the restaurant business my entire life, and rarely if ever is someone paying such close attention to even notice when something like that happens, let alone take the initiative to rectify the situation.  In fact, when he toId me he'd buy me a beer I was so surprised that I assumed they would forget by the time the bill came.  They did not, and my first beer was indeed comped.  Again, as a lifelong restaurant worker I am more than happy to give credit where credit is do.  Thanks for going above and beyond; I will make it a point to return to this particular location."}
{"text":"A popular place, great young energy, packed bar, upscale bar grub, probably the best spot in a 25 mile radius."}
{"text":"Loved it. We were just passing through with our young kids and decided to stop. Great beer selection! Food was good and well priced. Cool atmosphere. Kid friendly. Only issue was that it was 100 degrees outside and the restaurant had no AC. I was sweating through the whole meal."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and love their \"beer tour\" but notice the sauces are not as good as in the past... What happened?  Maybe we were drunk at the time but the garlic sauce is not as good as it used to be.  It tasted of overcooked garlic, a little bitter if you know what I mean.  The wings were wonderfully crispy which made up for it though.  :-D"}
{"text":"We stopped back in for a quick dinner before my boyfriend's son's baseball game.   If there's one thing from this that I'd like to communicate to some sort of management there: Your staff does not care, nor do they want customers to even come in. Or at least that what it seems like. And if your staff is that bad, not even your food or awesome beer selection can save you.  The food isn't even the bad part. My buffalo chicken salad, although simple, was good. They let you pick from the sauces and the spicy garlic is delightfully spicy. They throw that on some iceberg, celery, tomato and cheese and it's good. Plus, their homemade ranch dressing is spot on (don't judge me!)   But the service. Jeeezus. Did they put out an ad calling for all bitter, angry females stuck in their 2002 high school glory days? We walked in and the hostess literally refused to even look at us, let alone seat us until she figured out the damn popcorn machine (and trust me, although not rocket science, it took her a good 7 or 8 minutes.) After waiting, staring at her uncomfortably fumble with this machine for almost 10 minutes, she then, with an attitude, sat us.   We had about .5 seconds to choose what we wanted from the menu and when we asked her for more time, she left us alone for about 20 minutes. Cool--I'm now 86 years old and can order my food. Mind you, this place was empty. Not kind of empty. Empty. There was ONE table behind us, and I'll get to that in a minute.   Once it was the year 2025 and we finally got to order, the food was fine and she was quick with the tab, of course, since she wanted to get paid. But what really threw me was the absolutely awkward conversation she had with the table behind us. It was so bad that I almost intervened or called the manager. Basically what happened is all four of them (totally nice people) ordered the soup of the day. When our waitress came back to check on them, they politely told her that the soup was so salty it was borderline inedible. Not her fault, obviously, and not one of them blamed her or attacked her for it. But she literally DID NOT know what to do with that information. After a lot of \"ummms\" and \"wells\" she finally spit out, \"I don't really know what to tell you--I can tell the cook that it's not good, but I don't know what you want me to do.\" Bahahahahahahaha ha ha ha. Maybe you could apologize, offer to get the manager, take it off their check... have SOME plan of action.   I have no tolerance for this bratty, \"I don't give a crap, I'm off in 15 minutes\" attitude in the service industry. I've been there. I've bartended for years. You don't treat paying customers like crap. Listen, I'm sorry Ashley or Tammy called you in on your day off, but if you hate your job, there are plenty of people out there who would graciously take it off your hands and appreciate it. Trust me.   If you have any desire for even half-assed service, don't come here. You probably won't even get that."}
{"text":"Solid choice for a place with a lot of screens,  wings and an above average draft selection. Burgers are decent as well, but we usually head there for wings. Extra crispy.   Service turn around on wings is good. A pet peeve of mine is wing places don't have enough fryers to keep up with demand.   Servers have been uniformly nice to us. Better than 3 stars so I kicked it up a star. 3.5 would suit it best."}
{"text":"Had the BIGGEST BURGER IN MY LIFE there last night!!!! Forgot what it was called but I think it was 2 one pound patties!!!!!!  So what do I do? tell them to pour chili over top my fries!!!!! Oh yeah...2 32 oz beers and ole' Davie was feeling like a fat man!!!! VERY GOOD!!! So why not 4 or 5 stars? Freaken waitress was pulling disappearing act on us to the point I walked the entire floor NOT TO FIND HER....So I push buttons...Asked neighbor waitress if she can get the manager or my server, 30 seconds later she's magically clearing empty glasses and popcorn and doing her server thing.... After that incident she was QUITE attentive, I now think she might have had to go to the little girls room or something like that so I cut her slack and tipped my standard 20+ %....Food as always was yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I always love coming in here for a nice dinner every once in a while. Have a VERY WIDE selection of craft beers which is a plus. The wings are always cooked to perfection and have the right amount of sauce on them!"}
{"text":"We went here after a good little hike at CVNP. Very little parking available so you have to find a spot down the street and walk to the restaurant. We were seated by this arcade area where tons of little kids were playing. I did not mind it, but it was very loud and a little hard to have a conversation. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable, she suggested the Lamb Burger which is an April special and it was really tasty. We also enjoyed trying a couple different beers with our meal. The waitress said they were expanding their bar to allow for more drafts so that is cool if you're into trying different beers."}
{"text":"In short:   Beer 5 stars,  Service 0 stars,  Ambiance 3 stars (it's what you would expect)  Final 2.67 stars (rounded up to 3 stars)  For beer selection, it doesn't get much better than any Winking Lizard. The food, however, is just average, even for bar food.  I visited on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30/4:00. It was empty, but that didn't last long. By 6:00 the place was packed, and I mean PACKED. People were lining up waiting for a table; to EAT?! It was a bit mind-blowing really, because at the end of the day, I just don't see the draw if you're going there for a bite to eat.   On the flip side, and as I mentioned, you really can't beat the beer selection. Plenty of different brews on tap, and a plethora of bottle choices. If you're a beer snob, or even if you just like to pretend that you're a beer snob, the Winking Lizard should be on your list of routine stops.   That said, the service was near deplorability. The first bartender was a nice young girl, but she was only there for the first half-hour or so. She left, and her relief was just a flat-out angry person. I mean, I'm a \"judge not lest you be judged\" type of person; routinely giving people the benefit of the doubt, and can fully respect that she may have just been experiencing a bad day, but she didn't even appear to TRY to be friendly. This wasn't just toward me, but towards everyone at the bar.   I only comment on the service because I have read similar experiences in this regard. I certainly don't have any axe to grind, and it really didn't bother me on a personal level, but it was certainly noticeable.   Finally, the ambiance is typical \"sports-bar,\" with plenty of televisions to view \"the game\" on. The music selection, was also \"typical\" for Cleveland (i.e. an endless loop of AC / DC, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and any other outdated \"classic rock\" artists you can think of), but I can't necessarily fault the establishment for that, that's just Cleveland being Cleveland."}
{"text":"Every time I have been there, the wait staff is nice and the food is always good! This is a great place to go and hang out with your friends on a Friday or Saturday night and just chill with a couple of drinks. Have been coming here on Friday nights all summer long. It's a nice relaxing experience."}
{"text":"We live nearby and will normally stop by about once a month. It's al pretty good food, nothing too impressive but it's a sports bar. Still would recommend it for a meal or to watch a game"}
{"text":"Wings, burgers and beer - all kinds of beer.  Great selection of bottle beer and tap.  Great selection of wings, burgers, and salads.  Lots of big screen Tvs to watch the ball game.  Free popcorn and a big green live lizard in the window. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Winking Lizard restaurants around Cleveland and my response is becoming, \"what, another one?!\"  We drove into Peninsula after a hike by the deep lock and quarry, and I thought the town was very charming.  And then, \"what, another one?!\"  It boggles my mind that the area will support so many branches of this mediocre chain, but the awkward parking lot was overflowing.  Bar food is bar food is bar food, and that's pretty much all you can get here.  Unfortunately, I was not in the mood for deep-fried whatever the last time I was strong-armed into going here and found that even the salads are covered in meat and fried stuff.  Add in running children, a loud videogame arcade, and more TVs than an appliance store and you've got what apparently passes for family entertainment in this area.  If that's your thing, then godspeed to you.  I'd rather not go back."}
{"text":"Tried to have dinner with my husband at 6pm on a week day but was not able to because I didn't have an ID to prove I was over 21...... did I mention it was 6PM on a WEEKDAY? Can't believe they're willing to turn away business like that. They've lost my business for good."}
{"text":"The oasis in a national park! Too many beers to list. Too many menu items to mention. More than a feel good atmosphere. This. Was. Perfect. Especially after hiking..."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Despite how busy it always is, we were seated within ten minutes of being there. The staff all seemed super friendly and really keen on caring about the customers.   Not much more to say other than that! They also have an actual lizard chilling in there. Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"My friend, Erin, and I had a killer date tonight: dinner at Winking Lizard, followed by a showing of Paranormal Activity 2.  The dinner part was originally planned for a Steak N Shake nearby, but we saw Winking Lizard at the last minute and changed our minds.  I hadn't been to either restaurants before, but Winking Lizard sounded way more interesting.    Oh yeah, we made the right decision!  Lisa was our server and she was so great!  Even though it was busy, she took time to talk with us, beyond just explaining the evening specials and beer menu.  She was friendly and did her job well!  She kept our drinks full and checked in on us often. Tonight was wing night and half price pizza night, so I enjoyed an order of flavorful spicy BBQ wings and two orders of fries (trust me, they're worth it!), while my friend had her own white bread pizza.  I couldn't believe the check came to less than fifteen dollars!    I don't even think Erin minded being called a 'cheap date,' after the good time we had.  Dinner was satisfying, and the movie was as spooky and intense and entertaining as we hoped it would be.    I'm definitely bringing hubby back for Winking Lizard's World Tour of Beers.  If the variety of brew isn't enough of a draw for you, check out the prizes!"}
{"text":"The food is great every time we come. The chicken Philly is my favorite. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lovely little tavern in Peninsula, with seating available outside adjacent to the river. They offer several specials depending on the day, and the wings they serve are top notch. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable.   Note: those under 21, you cannot eat there without a parent/guardian after 5 Pm."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots and once again did not disappoint. Gabby was very attentive and a great server. I got the BBQ chicken meal and my mom got the Cajun chicken spinach salad. I also had the Fat Heads blueberry beer recommended by the server and really enjoyed it! So glad I was able to stop in while visiting! Awesome!"}
{"text":"If you stick to their soups, pizza and wings you won't be disappointed. Actually you can add their strip steak to the list. It's 12 ounces and is served with a veg, potato, and garlic bread. For the price of $12.99 it's as good as the steaks that I've have had at a \"steak house\". Fresh popcorn on weekends to enoy while watching one of there many TVs. The staff is friendly and has been trained well. Not a bad place all and all. Patio is open during the summer months."}
{"text":"Lower than 1 star. Most ridiculous policy I've EVER encountered! My 18 year old daughter and her 20 year old friend were turned away, on a Tuesday evening at 8:05 pm, because neither was 21 and it was after 8! They didn't attempt to go to the bar, didn't present themselves as older. ONLY wanted to order dinner after finishing work. Extremely snotty girl at hostess stand -- who likely wasn't 21 herself! -- looked them up and down and said \"no entrance.\" The restaurant was loaded with families, with small children. But an 18 and 20 year old were turned away. There are plenty of restaurants in Brunswick, and although Lizard was always a bit subpar compared to Panini's, we've spent quite a bit of money there over the years. No more! I've never heard of anything so silly in my life. Nor have we enountered any other Lizard franchise who enforces something this ridiculous. Apparently what happens when you put people with no common sense in charge. Time for new management. Yay Panini's!"}
{"text":"Hey another Winking Lizard.  Same food (its good).  But I really like this one.  The bar is really cool.  Long and seating on both sides.  Recommend about any of the Great Lakes Brew."}
{"text":"What has happened to the Lizard??!! I ordered a summer special, brisket tacos. Tacos were so greasy that the grease was running onto the plate. They came with stale Tostitos with cheese whiz. Awful!!!  Waitress was so dingy. Had no idea about the beer we ordered from the menu. So sad. I only get to Cleveland  a couple of times a year, and I used to look forward to stopping by the Lizard."}
{"text":"Our waiter Cory was superb, what a gentleman, fast and funny as well. The asparagus steak salad is worth eating over and over."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a wonderful experience at the Winking Lizard last week.  We were in from out of town and when my daughter heard the name of this place we just had to go, and it did not disappoint.  Even though we were told the wait would be 30 minutes (really good for a Saturday evening!), we ended up waiting only about 10 or so.  Our server, Angela, was awesome.  I informed her of my daughter's food allergies and she was super attentive and helpful, as was the kitchen manager working that evening (I wish I had gotten his name).  I got their brisket sandwich, my daughter got their grilled cheese, and we split a chicken quesadilla.  All were excellent!  Of course, you can't forget the popcorn and game room.  Overall, a great experience for us out of towners.  I'll definitely go back when I find myself in town again.  Don't forget to say hi to Heisman the giant iguana too!"}
{"text":"we have never had a bad meal there.. food is good.. not anything that will wow you but still good.. beer is good and service has always been fine.. solid 4 stars for me"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Winking Lizard in years.  I spent a number of Happy Hours at the Bedford Hts. Winking Lizard years ago.  It hasn't changed   I had a hamburger cooked to perfection.  The hostess and waitress were friendly.  I do miss the World Tour of Beers.  [Note:  I visited Winking Lizard in Brunswick before my committment to my 50 by 50 Challenge.]"}
{"text":"Friends came in from out of town. We had 13 total and offered to put the 6 kids at one table and the adults at another. We were told we should think about somewhere else because they were busy. Really?  We waited and were treated like we were a bother. The food was good, but service was terrible and completely unfriendly (from the hostess to the wait staff). If you don't want to work there, so sorry. You are not doing us favors...we come to the establishment with money to pay for food and service."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy going to the Winking Lizard. I have tried many of their different dishes and I have not found one I didn't like. It's an all-around good place. The hamburgers are good, I like their corned beef, and (of course) their wings!   For their spring menu, they added a lamb burger... Which is awesome!  Great beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Husband ordered Wednesday special of ribs.  He said it was very good.  I ordered tomato cucumber mozzarella with grilled chicken, also very good.  Service great.  Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"The wings and burgers are good.  We have been here several times.  The only drawback is the parking situation."}
{"text":"100's of beer choices and hiking?  Seriously?  Since I like good imported beer, hiking, biking, and a great view...what's not to like?  Been here a few times, but always feel guilty when it's not coupled with exercise.  LOL.  The hot wings are better than BWW's, but it is the pints from around the world that get my attention.  :o)"}
{"text":"Winking Lizard, no matter what location, is a solid place you can always go to for a good burger or sandwich. Nothing fancy, nothing crazy. You find a spot, sit down, order a drink and some good food and you're always full when you leave. I've always had good service. Peninsula is a nice little spot, very cute little town. Very dependable place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  Love the atmosphere and the food is very good!  The waitstaff is awesome!  It's located in the very old Peninsula Nightclub and still has all of the original character..... their wings are excellent and make sure to try the Greek Salad!  Bowman Burgers are excellent!"}
{"text":"This place rocks, its kind of dark and nothing fancy inside, but you can't beat the great bar-food.  I highly recommend the beef brisket sandwich with the iceberg wedge salad.......yummmmm....great service and always relaxing place."}
{"text":"I frequent many of the lizards in the greater Cleveland area and this is the only location which has routinely left me wanting more in terms of service. Food is always consistent with the other restaurants, but the servers at Mentor are poorly trained. Orders incorrct, bills incorrect, forgetting to check on you after getting your food."}
{"text":"My favorite of all the Winking Lizards.  Its a very cool old niteclub and the drive to get there is through the awesome Cuyahoga Valley Nation forest!  I love taking rides on Sundays starting on Rockside Rd and winding through till we hit the Lizard.  The service can be good, depending on who ya get.  It seems the bar area is more busy and longer waits.  They have a cool game room for kids too!  Watch out for weekends..its by the tow path so you wil see a lot old old guys who ride bikes wearing the little spandex outfits...I just threw up a little...  Oh, and they have a patio for those obnoxious \"I have to sit outside and eat\" people.."}
{"text":"Try not to go to the east side but yesterday I had no choice.  Typical Mentor spot in a strip mall.  Big restaurant with games for the kids.  Food came out right and fairly quickly.  Server was OK..not very friendly. We were the only table there and our tab would of been higher had we felt more welcome. Next time ya might wana be nicer to the table of 6 Irish people who  drink more than they eat at lunch..."}
{"text":"Would give this a 3.5 star rating if I could, but can't quite seem to justify rounding up to a 4 star review. I have been a couple times to this Winking Lizard, and each time the service has been hit or miss. Sometimes the waitress would give you an attitude if you were only there to order drinks, which was somewhat annoying. BUT one of my favorite parts about Winking Lizard is their huge drink selection. They have different beers on draft based on the season, and tons of options of bottled beers. Other than that, just you're typical restaurant/bar establishment."}
{"text":"I have been traveling to Ohio for years and every trip, I make it a point to visit the Winking Lizard. The food is average bar food, but the beer selection, service and atmosphere are excellent and make the place.  It is also a great location to bring your kids during the day for lunch with a basic menu, games and entertainment."}
{"text":"Rolled in for lunch. Conveniently located next to the OTET. Place was pretty busy but we were able to get a seat outside however, it was a bit sunny at our table. Some tables had umbrellas for cover.  Burgers were good. Recommend"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I've been to any Winking Lizard. I'd call it a solid \"OK\". We were seated right away (good for a Friday night) and the service was fine.   Maybe I'm misremembering, but I thought they used to have a lot bigger food selection. They had a bunch of burgers and chicken sandwiches, ribs, BBQ chicken, appetizers, and that was about it. I got the ribs and my wife got the BBQ chicken. Both were OK. The portions were generous, the taste was OK (but nothing special), but both were a little dried out. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, but I won't rush back.  They do have a huge beer selection and I have a very nice Belgian."}
{"text":"I live right by a Winking Lizard in downtown Cleveland, but I've only ever visited the one in Peninsula, Ohio, after a day of hiking in Cuyahoga National Park.  My other half ordered wings, because it's a must. The spicy garlic flavor is by far my favorite of the 3 different kinds I tried (Spicy BBQ, Spicy Garlic, and Cajun). I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with fries, and it totally hit the spot.  The menu is so big though. I never even got through the full menu before ordering. I felt a bit overwhelmed with the abundance of menu items. It's like a book!   The food is decent though, and the vibe is super chill. Go for the wings, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As a member of the Tour of Beers and the fact that my best friend works at the Lakewood location, I frequent the Lizard often. Tonight was by far the most disappointing experience I have had at any of the Lizards.   We ordered the queso fundido and instead of being a mixture of cheese and chorizo, it came out as nacho cheese sauce with black beans and chopped up hot dog. Second, we ordered salads and had to ask for salt and pepper because the servers were so concerned with closing the room that a our condiments were pulled. This is not a big deal, but I had to search for any server to ask because ours was M.I.A. We ordered wings (on wing night) and my best friend (the one who works at the Lizard) had some strange, stringy pieces attached to her wing. As I noticed this, in front of the server, she never once asked to bring it back to the kitchen to make sure it was ok. As a result she barely at her wings. Her daughter's boneless wings were barely covered in sauce and we needed to ask for more just to taste the flavor. Not to mention I had to ask for a refill on water (really?). Two managers walked through and never once bothered to glance at the dining room or ask how our meal was.   I don't complain very often because I work in the food service industry and fully understand the trials and tribulations a restaurant can encounter on a daily basis. But since the restaurant was mostly empty, it's hard to look past the continuous poor service. I'm sure, to some locals this location is a fan favorite, however, I can not see the attraction.   P.s. Just walked past two managers as I left and neither gentleman acknowledged our presence."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this Winking Lizard since I started biking the Tow Path and it has been on my list everytime I'm biking down the trail. Very closely located for that great breaking spot.  As with the other Winking Lizard, their beer lists are one of the best in the area.  The food and service has been consistant everytime I have been here.  I'm a fan and I will contuine to visit as I make my treks down the tow path"}
{"text":"What's there to like?? Well the beer selection... If it wasn't for that, not much would keep this lizard afloat. Service is pretty much non-existant, food prep is inconsistent and quality just seems to be taking a tumble as well. If I want a Winking Lizard experience, I opt for the one in Coventry or Peninsula.  It's establishments like this that fall short of original concept I opt for an alternative."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the Lizard!  There's always something going on.  Plenty of tvs to watch the big game and always good service.  They offer a huge beer list and the food is good too!"}
{"text":"Great little dive bar in downtown Cleveland!  If you like craft beers, this place is for you---sporting over a hundred different beers that I rarely find in my home town. The bartenders were friendly and they seemed to have a relatively extensive bar food menu though we didn't eat.  Highly recommended for beer lovers!!"}
{"text":"Once again another great experience at the Winking Lizard. I really enjoy the wide variety of beverages as well as the atmosphere. This Winking Lizard is different from the others in that it has a more vintage feel. That is not to say that the other restaurants are bad but this one is slightly different. We enjoyed the game room and my daughter absolutely loves the Iguana named Heisman. I'm usually someone who gets something different every time I go to a restaurant however this Winking Lizard does the ribs so very well that I get them every single time. The only exception is when they offer their clambakes. The clambakes here are phenomenal as they offer many options such as steak Lobster chicken and even ribs paired with or without your clams. The only thing that I would suggest to make this restaurant better is to offer the clambakes year-round. I understand this probably won't happen but I can always try. Keep up the good work and you have a customer here for as long as we live in Ohio."}
{"text":"Standard Lizard fare- that is to say, something for everyone- in a nice setting. The location of this one, directly off of the Towpath, makes it a nice post-bike ride (or post-run, if you're into that sort of thing) stop for a refreshing quaff. Like other locations, they have an insanely large and well-curated beer list. Check out the cool cellar for a more unique drinking or dining experience."}
{"text":"How can I not give a 4 star review to a place that has as much free popcorn as you want, great beer and great food?  Exactly.  This place is a local chain, with several locations.  I ended up here after a hike / trip to CVNP and it hit the spot.  What was really funny was the giant lizard they had (it was an iguana) that all the patrons got to gawk at.  In Florida, we see those things running around all over the place, and some actually eat them.    This place is known for its wings, but they also had good burgers and a huge selection of beers.  I would go back if I was in the area.  Did I mention all the POPCORN you can eat?"}
{"text":"We went to The Winking Lizard today for lunch. We were promptly sat in the Bar area at a table in front of five televisions to catch the latest sport games. Our waitress, Katelyn was very sweet and attentive.   I ordered a beer from the World Tour of Beers. Maui Brewing Company Pineapple Mana Wheat Ale.  We ordered several wings: mild and spicy sesame sauces. They were crispy and meaty. Both came with creamy blue cheese dressing and celery. Right after the wings were served, our sandwiches arrived. There was no spacing between the appetizer and our entreès.  I ordered a Turkey Burger. A juicy ground turkey burger served on a multi-grain roll with melted Muenster cheese, lettuce and tomato. Served with  a roasted red pepper sauce on top to complement it.  However, after a couple bites, I realized I had received a hamburger with swiss cheese on top. The rice pilaf was delicious. My (incorrect) burger was cooked perfect. Katelyn offered to replace it and the manager took it off our bill. They were very welcoming. The kitchen and runners need to pace the food courses and double-check the table orders."}
{"text":"This was our latest stop and more than likely the last bar 'experiment' we will try for awhile.  The tavern is rich with local lore and history, which is neat if you want a history lesson.  As for us, we like the entertainment and dining portion of our visits more than tavern history.  The server was polite, friendly, made some suggestions for us when we asked what was good, and overall did fine.  Nothing special, and also nothing wrong.  The food was blah.  Thats the best way to describe it.  I tried the pulled pork, which I love trying because some bars will blow your mind with how good it is.  This was bland, dry, no vinegar, no sweetness... just blah.  The bun was just something out of a bag.  Having had good barbecue from North Carolina and Texas, I know what it should taste like and this was way off the mark.    Normally we wouldn't leave a bad review if we just try one meal here, as we rarely eat the whole menu.  That being said, the salad my wife was served was close to inexcusable.  Nothing ruins a salad quicker than chicken that is obviously out of a bag and wet, soggy lettuce.  The least you could have done is try to convince us that the salad was fresh, even when we know it isn't.    Anyways, in fairness, we did NOT eat the whole menu but the things we did eat, to include an appetizer, tasted like it came straight out of a bag and/or box.  Zero originality in this place.  If you want a beer, might be a good spot.  If you want food, find something else."}
{"text":"NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.  Normally a fan, but had some college-aged hostess yell at my two year old for playing on the games in the back (in a way I've seen lots of other kids play on/with the games and in a way in which other hostesses, bartenders and waitresses have seen him and others play).  Usually go in once or twice a month, primarily because it was family friendly and there are games for my child to play while we wait for our food.  My son actually would ask to go see lizard.  After this experience, we may stop going there altogether."}
{"text":"I used to like this place however in the past year the staff have made it unbearable. The last time we went the hosting staff basically got annoyed and rude with us (because it was more important to talk to their friends who were hanging around the hostess table) when I asked if we could change our seats. They agreed to let us however an extremely drunken man stumbled from the bar and sat down when they were finished busing the new table and when I said these were for us he started yelling and got the hostess who ended up apologizing to him!! We were just standing there stunned. Finally we left and spent our money elsewhere. If this is how the owner wants their employees to work and act then they deserve the drunk customer over the family looking to eat. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Located in beautiful downtown Peninsula this nostalgic ex dance hall has a great vibe and plenty of food and beer to appease darn near anyone! The menu has a great selection of traditional Americana style food. Aside from wings, burgers, pizza and more there are healthy options on the menu as well. Like beer? Well you came to the right spot. The beer menu has hundreds of tasty choices! After you've satisfied your taste buds you can check out some neat little shops in the town, take a nice bike ride down the towpath or take a train ride. There's plenty to do and see after you've visited the Winking Lizard. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Worst wings ever - time and time again have tried them but these wings are awful. Only saving grace are drink recipes."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard is a classic burger joint/bar.  Classic bar food, brought in in 50 gallon drums.  Fine.  My complaint--it was about 90 degrees and HUMID inside.  I left the place damp from sweat.  It was miserable.  I wish I would have turned around and left when I sensed the indoor climate.  I would go there again, in the fall or winter.  People, you just GOTTA get your A/C working properly."}
{"text":"These places are everywhere!!  Well I guess I am too if I'm reviewing multiple locations, right?  This WL is in Brunswick where I meet a couple that I've known since college and we always sit around, catch-up, exchange belated birthday gifts, and eat / drink.  This is usually a 2+ hour occasion and WL staff do not seem to mind at all.    This specific location is always busy, especially the bar.  Popcorn machine is always full of delicious, perfectly salted popped corn.  We always get the pizza and wings which everyone seems to enjoy, kids always find something off of the kids menu, they're not old enough for the spicy garlic wings.  The restaurant is clean, bathrooms are nice, and there's a small game room upon entering the place.  I guess it fits the Brunswick crowd to a tee.  There are other options up on Pearl but I prefer to be close to the highway, easy on, easy off Daniel-son."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The hottest wings on the menu are surprisingly not actually that spicy. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, but it might be overwhelming for some. My only complaint was that there was no coat racks."}
{"text":"Good tavern food, funky atmosphere- great family place or bar to sit & sip. Usually sports TVs & wide variety of beers - services is remarkably good."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. The bartenders were very friendly and efficient. Food was excellent. The buffalo chicken salad is a bowl of pure heated awesomeness! I've never had their wings but I hear they are very good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I dig the 'Liz! This happens to be the closest one to us but any Lizard will do. The food is above average for the typical pub grub, there is not a bad seat in the house, and the brews are there to fit any style. One of the only places that carries Hoegaarden on draught, for that they get an extra star. Never tried the tour but seems cool. The service is usually nice and attentive and seem to know their brews, which would be frustrating other wise. Also, a very nice patio with full bar outside on the nice summer nights."}
{"text":"During our recent trip on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, my family and I stopped at the Peninsula station to explore and get some lunch. As for as lunch goes, there isn't a whole lot in this historic village. Fortunately there is a Winking Lizard Tavern there, one of the eighteen locations of this northeastern Ohio based chain.  The restaurant was pretty full for it being mid-afternoon on a Sunday. The restaurant is spacious enough that there was no wait, in fact we had our choice to be close to the game area or on the quieter side of the restaurant.  I ordered the pulled BBQ chicken melt topped with smoked Gouda along with Applewood bacon and served between grilled sourdough with steak fries and a pickle spear ($8.79). The sandwich was large and tasty. The BBQ sauce was especially good.  My wife enjoyed the Maui Maui grilled chicken sandwich, which is marinated in teriyaki and topped with grilled pineapple ($8.49). My kids devoured the mini corn dogs from the kids menu. From sandwiches and burgers to pizza and BBQ, there is something from everyone at the Winking Lizard. Plus the beer list is very good and constantly changing. Even if there were other places in Peninsula, this would still be the place to go."}
{"text":"We visited there on Friday. Ordered food and the there was a hair in it and we complained. They took our food away and the manager told us it was a hair from corn. Which was fine and believable. Problem: the manager apologized and charged us for the meals!!!"}
{"text":"All time favorite place to go! The atmosphere is phenomenal. Service is consistent and great! Food always comes out quick and tastes good. I've been going there for over 10 years and I have never had a problem."}
{"text":"This is my family's \"go-to\" place on the weekends, because the wings and beer selection are THE BEST and the atmosphere is great for a family with a young child. There is a game area and the dining area is so lively (in a good way), that we never feel like our little one is too exuberant for dining out. Even when it is busy, the food and service are worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is or regular place for office parties. They have a large selection of beers for beer lovers. The food is decent too. Do try their specials on the menu. I have seen a live lizard oncetheir spinach and artichoke dip with nachos is awesome."}
{"text":"The lizard never disappoints! I love the location of this restaurant because it's really convenient when I'm on my way to blossom for a concert. It can get really busy at times but the bar is huge!  Snack on some popcorn will you drink a craft beer and decide what to eat. I've had both the boneless and regular wings here before and they are not to be missed! The last time we ended up here, I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was the bomb. Seriously, the bread of the sandwich was two pieces if garlic toast... Are you on your way to Winking Lizard yet?"}
{"text":"The service was slow and we couldn't get water refills. The waitress asked how everything was and before I had a chance to swallow what was in my mouth to tell her she was gone. We both had our cards out to pay and instead of picking them up to charge them she dropped off the ck and took off before I could say to please take our cards. I started to say it but she was gone and never came back. I had to take the ck to the bar and request them to ck me out. Beside that, my friend's meal was very dry and they didn't even apologize. She had to take her glass to the bar to get a water refill since her meat was so dry. Overall it was a lousy experience."}
{"text":"nothing special.  certainly not as good in food quality compared to their Independence location.  house salad was mediocre.  wings were a huge disappointment--definitely sitting under a warmer or even microwave heated from the night before, considering we showed up at opening.  I've been here before and it was a lot bettet.  star off for inconsistency?"}
{"text":"Great location, love to stop here after a bike ride. Reasonably priced food, great beer selection. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Good place all around.  Been there twice this year. Clean shop.  Decent food (I had a wrap most recently). Attentive service.  Great bottled and draft beer selection.  Nice outdoor patio.  Great location, in middle of CVNP and right along its main bike trail.  Parking can be tight, but it's not a major hindrance. As a side note, I really like that they kept the old Peninsula Nite Club neon sign!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, lots of TVs, free popcorn. Never had anything bad here but it is probably a bit more expensive than it should be. I usually get the Bowman's steak and cheese. Monday and Tuesday are good for wings."}
{"text":"My wife, my 17 year old son and I ate at this restaurant. I encourage you to eat outside on the patio. The service was pleasant and quick. I got some wings. I liked the barbecue sauce so much I bought some to take home. The place had a local charm to it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. The place is clean and nice. Menu is decent. I had the steak wrap with grilled mushrooms and cheese, minus the lettuce and onion. First bite had raw onion. You cannot mistake that awful taste. I sent it back. They sent it back to me saying there were no onions on it. I opened it up and I couldn't find any but if you hate onion you know when you bite into one. The other issue was the steak was flavorless, no seasoning whatsoever. And it was cold to room temperature at best. Same with the mushrooms. So much so that the cheese wasn't even melted. All in all it was gross. Not worth coming back again."}
{"text":"I love the Winking Lizard. I have been coming here with my family ever since my parents thought my brother and I were old enough to behave ourselves in a restaurant. As a child, getting to go to the place with the live, awesome-looking lizard in the terrarium was a big deal! The Winking Lizard is such a nice place for food and beverages with any fun-loving, chill group of people. You can come looking casual fancy; you can come looking sweaty in athletic wear after a walk or bike ride on the Towpath. I've even been on a first date here, after my Tinder match and I ran 10 miles!  The restaurant looks great no matter where you sit: the bar, the tables around the main room with the bar, the room to the right of the doorway, the tables on the glass-windowed porch. You should also head down to the whiskey cave in the basement to check it out. The servers are always friendly and competent. The food is well-made pub fare, with a great selection of salads that are both healthy and fun to eat. There are TVs with sports in the main rooms. Prices are extremely reasonable but not too cheap that you have suspicions about the quality.  What's the best part of the Lizard? THE BEER MENU. It is insanely large and awesome. Whatever style you like, you can find it here. If I lived in the area, I would totally do their beer club, the Tour of Beers.  There are a ton of Winking Lizards around Northeast Ohio, including one quite close to the house in which I grew up. But we always go to the one in the Valley, so that's the one that I like best. The original Winking Lizard is in Bedford Heights. If you are a visitor to the CLE, you def need to get slizzard at the Lizard."}
{"text":"Best wings ever!   I use to go to school at Kent State early in 2000 ...  I guess I never really appreciated this place as I was always looking for the \"college\" places to hang out.    I've started coming back to Hudson for work, and have ended up here at least 1 or 2 nights a week.  Great bar, great atmosphere ... amazing grown up selection of good beers, Begian and German brews, as well as all sorts of good micro brews.   The Curry wings are amazing, all the wings are good.  I also love the Big Ed burger with the preferred fries... definitely tavern style food, but you can't go wrong.   Good place to go and chill if you're traveling solo for work ... always end up with good conversation with the friendly locals at the bar."}
{"text":"Mentor Winking Lizard is under new management, come in and enjoy!  A great beer list and a large whiskey list - stop by this Spring and enjoy. Monday and Tuesday is wing night. Wednesday is rib night $ 8.49 for 1/2 slab yum. Thursday night is burger night. The best kept secret is soup.  Changes frequently, so ask your server.  Stop by for fun evening or quick lunch. Spring seasonal menu April2-May28th."}
{"text":"A sports bar for the whole family, but not a great compromise. Too big and family oriented to be a real sports bar. Too noisy and eh in the food department to be a real family restaurant. A real divey bar or a decent casual restaurant would be better."}
{"text":"We went to Winking Lizard with friends and we loved it. Decor is pretty cool, like a summer camp in Louisiana and they do beer bike rides in the summer and you can take a train ride back.   The beer selection is outrageous in size and the cost per draft was pretty cheap. We are from Pittsburgh, so we were really excited to try new beers and they have a lot of local breweries on tap.   We got wings,  which were spot on and we really enjoyed their Mexican chicken salad. Our server was extremely helpful and she was also attentive the entire time.    Overall this place was a blast, food and service were great and it didn't break the bank.  We will definitely be visiting this place again this summer."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in while waiting for our dinner reservation at a restaurant near by. They have a great selection of beers but I was slightly disappointed in the fried macaroni & cheese appetizer I ordered. It was obviously frozen and just dropped in the deep fryer. Very little macaroni & cheese and mostly breading.  The free popcorn was a plus though.  Wouldn't return specifically for anything but it was worth it just for the beer and decent price of it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took a train ride through the Cuyahoga Valley and had lunch at the Winking Lizard. Space is the definition of cool. The food was excellent and the server was really educated on the menu. We left full and happy."}
{"text":"I particularly like this Winking Lizard! Just in a great location, food and service is great."}
{"text":"Make sure you have your ID ready the Gestapo will check it 37 times. The attitude of staff was horrible, a change of staff would be a great idea!! They stalked a girl we were with until she got out of the bathroom so she could prove the she was over 21 (32). Management here needs to be 86'd."}
{"text":"Easy for this one, Go on Monday's or Tuesday's for pizza and wings!  You can't go wrong food wise, but service can be hit or miss (just like every other casual restaurant in NEO)"}
{"text":"The last couple of times my husband & I have been there, our servers were horrible!   The last time, our server came & took our drink order, 20 mins later my husband was STILL waiting for his beer. Again another 20 minute wait for his second beer. Unacceptable!   The good thing, I debated between 2 menu items & she actually recommended this one salad..it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So good news and bad news...Let me first start off with the slightly negative part of this review... but keep reading because I am part of a family that fully supports several locations of Winking Lizards ;)   While it is convenient to be off of the (biking, hiking and walking Cleveland Metroparks) towpath when you're extremely hungry (especially on a weekend) beware that there is an extremely long wait to even get your name on the list to be seated! This was the worst experience about this Winking Lizard. They need a new system, you cannot have people waiting 15-20 mins to even be placed on the list. Fix this and you will be golden! Because, honestly, you cannot beat a Winking Lizard on a trail that allows people to lock their bikes up and enjoy a good meal with a ton of other fun-loving people enjoying the same outdoor adventures! But you have to avoid the people getting extremely frustrated at this ineffective system.  I will say this: to the kind manager who was in charge on this busy Labor Day weekend (Sunday to be exact), kudos to you ma'am! We witnessed her making things better to please customers left and right! If it weren't for this stand up lady things would have been much more unorganized than the heavy customer count already was forcing them to experience. She was wonderful.  Now let's talk about food! Huge menu (both beer and food), tons of options! The BEST veggie wrap I have had since becoming a vegetarian! It was fresh and had the perfect combination of flavor and veggies. It was not dry, veggies were fresh, it did not fall apart and it was SO satisfying! I scarfed this baby down (after biking 13 miles I was starving for lunch!) and was pleased with every bite. I even splurged and had fries as my side! They are not greasy and have just the perfect crisp! My non-vegetarian boyfriend even had the veggie wrap for lunch and completed it loving every bite as well! I can't recommend this dish enough.   Our waitress was a friendly young lady who was obviously flustered by this INSANELY busy day they were having, nonetheless, she was friendly and her service was consistent and appropriate and we felt her pain.   We enjoyed our lunch once finally being seated and regardless of that slightly negative taste in our mouth from the first 20-30 minutes at this location. We have to still urge you to go and support this location because of the unique experience it allows you to have while experiencing the great outdoors! So go out there and make a day out of the Towpath and the Winking Lizard ;)"}
{"text":"For the first time, in many visits,  my husband and I had horrible service tonight. Our waitress was more concerned about flirting than helping us. My portion of food was so small that I ordered an appetizer to go... It never showed up!!!  We are usually very generous tippers, but not tonight!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while in from out of town, in need of a  Bloody Mary. Drinks were spicy & delicious, burger was juicy & the side house salad even has bacon. Tons of TVs, and saw many kids with popcorn so great for families too. Would return if in the area again. Oh and yes, there is a live lizard -bonus!"}
{"text":"What in the bloody hell?! I have been here many times and the bartenders are typically not very good. Fortunately, the food is pretty good and they have a good beer selection,  so I deal with it. This last time however, and I do mean it is the last time, the service was atrocious. It was a normal day, not too busy even when you consider the patio patrons. My boyfriend was without a beer for 20 minutes and I made it 15 before deciding not to order another. Maybe when the staff is having a lover's quarrel, they should save it for home instead of walking by empty glasses a dozen times without acknowledging their customers. Eventually, one of the bar tenders finally did look at my empty glass and my boyfriend finally decided to politely hold his up to show how empty his glass is, and was still ignored. The best part is, 10 seconds after I set my card in the rocks glass to pay, they saw it immediately and scooped it up. So, either they hate us for being regular yet, quiet patrons, or they are just not very good. Either way, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for families and for friends. They have a bar and a bunch of TVs to watch all the games. Even though we had to wait 20 minutes for a table, they offer free all you can eat popcorn while you wait and they even have a lizard you can say hello to! Service was ok and the food was good, but the atmosphere is what really shines. Decent prices and I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Great one to catch a good bite of food!  This Lizard is large compared to others I've been to.  The parking is horrendous, but worth it on a nice day.  They have a wonderful outdoor area.  Many TVs on the inside and decent food portions.  Tasty."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We are from out of town & we asked the concierge at the hotel for a recommendation.  They said it would be a 20 min. Wait, but we got seated right away. That was great, but they kept calling my cell ph telling me my reservation was ready. We ordered drinks & the service was horrible.  Waitress never refilled out water, took forever to get food, etc.  very disappointed !"}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere at lunch. Enjoyed a bean-veggie burger. Delicious. Declined the fries. Had the vegetable of the day. Watched the stormy weather on the TVs."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Another disappointing day at a Winking Lizard.    This is a typical stop for us after biking down the towpath.  What's a better destination than a bar?  Well...maybe I just need to find a different bar.    Not only is the food overpriced and average, but last night I had the worst service!  Our waitress looked like she wanted us to leave before we even sat down and never once tried to assist us any more than is required.    What I was especially miffed with was they seemed to be out of everything!  I tried to order a Cider.  Nope.  Then I tried to order a Wedge Salad.  Nope.  They're out of salad?  Are you kidding  me?  Can't someone hop over to a grocery store and buy a couple heads of lettuce.  I mean, seriously...lettuce?!?  Overall, this is a great bar but it's a chain and they make it evident.  I'd rather go to TGI Friday's to be honest..."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard has about 18 locations around northeastern Ohio, but I've always enjoyed visiting this location the most. I'm sure everyone has been to the Winking Lizard but if you're new to the area or just passing through, let me give you the down-low on this place.   This location can be found in the small town of Peninsula, next to the Cuyahoga river, Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Rail Road, and the Hike & Bike trail, which makes it an ideal place to grab some food or a beer. Unfortunately, due to the heavy foot traffic finding a parking spot can be a real pain in the butt, especially on the weekends. If you don't find a spot around the building you can usually find a spot around town. Just take note of the towing signs, Peninsula doesn't mess around.  As for the restaurant, the building has been there since the early 20's from what I can tell. The main dinning room features vintage signs and photos, a large 'u' shaped bar, TVs in every direction you look, and a glass cage featuring what else... an iguana. They also have an outdoor patio for when the weather is nice out, and a VERY cool basement bar that used to be a speakeasy during the prohibition era.   The food is usually good... I would give them 8 out of 10 most of the time. You're not going to find unique delicacies here, just your typical American food: BBQ, wings, burgers, salads, and pizzas. The free popcorn is a nice touch. What makes this place special though is their beer selection! Around 100 different beers to be exact. You can join what they call their 'Beer Tour', which is a competition to taste all 100 beers within a year and at the end they'll reward you a prize. I'm a 2004 beer tour alumni :)  Some people have had bad experiences here, which I can understand. This place can get REALLY busy and you can't please everyone. I can only speak from my own experiences and over the past 15 years they have all been good ones! So the next time you're taking a trip through the valley, whether by car, train or bike, you should put this place on your agenda."}
{"text":"I have been visiting the Peninsula Lizard for 16 years and have enjoyed until the new management team. Since Gary (GM) left the management team and service has gone down hill. The cellar has been a great addition and is a great place to get away from the crowds but with the new management team that's now completely gone down hill also. Bring Gary Back Please!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to hang out and grab some beers and food!!  The only bad thing is that there can occasionally be a wait.  I was thrilled when they stopped letting people smoke on the patio!!  I love to sit outside here in the summer but I hate being around smoke.  Win!"}
