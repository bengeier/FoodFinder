{"text":"The Brimfield Family Restaurant was a pleasant suprise. My husband and I were out running errands, then decided it was time for a bite to eat. We passed a few local resturants on tallamage road, but those didn't have the diner type food we were in the mood for. Apon pulling into the parking lot we had no idea what to expect but we were ready to try some place new. The risk was worth it! Please do not go to this establishment with the cookie cutter expecting of chain restaurants or you may be disappointed. The food is closer to the home cooked vibe, with some corners cut ( the rolls looked like something from the bread section of the grocery store, but who doesn't suppliment these days with store options). The staff was friendly, and the building was clean."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite breakfast spot!  Delicious made-from-scratch meals made with the same care and attention one would expect from the type of breakfast grandma makes when the grandkids are visiting.   Huge homemade buttermilk biscuits, thinly sliced home fries, and perfectly scrambled eggs were a definite highlight.  However the ultimate experience were the pancakes!   These things were the circumference of a large dinner plate and almost an inch thick.  I ordered mine with blueberries and it was absolutely stuffed with some of the sweetest, juiciest berries I've ever had.  Check out the picture!  I highly recommend visiting this little hidden gem in small town Ohio.  I've been to many breakfast locations, including some of the most famous locales across the country.  Brimfield Family Restaurant is among the best you'll ever have."}
{"text":"I love this place. You're not going to be blown away, but everything I've had has been really good. I go here for breakfast mostly and have not been disappointed. It's a dive, but the food comes in huge portions at a great price!"}
{"text":"Have visited the Brimfield Steakhouse many times and is is pretty basic but friendly, efficient and affordable. Sticking to the basics for breakfast, lunch or dinner will work. Specials can be good like Salisbury steak or the soups. A promised upgrade in decor is a good idea."}
{"text":"What a dump. Dirty dishes, food is terrible  Save yourself the stomach ache and eat somewhere else, even McDonalds would be better choice. New management does not mean anything, same crap"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Friendly staff.  On Tuesday it is all you can eat chicken OMG there is so much food and yummmmmmy.  You get like half a chicken and the jojos are huge.  Great home-style family place."}
{"text":"Again our church group met here for lunch. Food was good and our waitress was excellent. My 9nly complaint would be that they take time and use some extra strong cleaner and get all the sticky gunk off the Tables! I'm used to having my place mat move around the table. Not the case here. It was as if it was glued down. There was Maple syrup all over the table that had dried but was sticky. We may return but not when I host the lunch."}
{"text":"Breakfast was mediocre. Biscuit was dry and the home fries were undesirable. Couldn't eat the sausage patties unless I put syrup on it. So definitely no on the breakfast  Seeing the reviews really had high hopes. Maybe I came on a bad day for breakfast. Friendly service though though."}
{"text":"Great homemade food, and great service. We had fried chicken sandwich and breakfast entree, both were excellent. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but a rather nice surprise out in the country."}
{"text":"All I can say is terrible service!  I went yesterday on all you can eat fish night. It seemed like that's the only thing they cared about serving. My family ordered two hamburgers and a bowl of chili. We waited around 45 minutes. Our waitress ignored us, never apologized for the delay ... people seated after us were getting their second servings before we even got our meal. At least offer a basket of rolls or something! I will not be going back, as I was made to feel like more of an annoyance (because we didn't order the fish) instead of appreciated customers."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for breakfast. He got the country fried steak and me the steak and eggs. Both meals were good. Friendly service. Always made sure we had enough coffee. And the place was very comfortable too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Even want to star they don't deserve went there Friday the 18th after seeing Star Wars good thing I ate popcorn at the movie theater because the food they brought me out nearly made me vomit I asked for Home fries I was brought a bowl of slice the potatoes were raw and had hot gravy poured over them it's at the girl nearly 15 minutes to figure out that she needed to come see why wasn't eating my food I ordered the shrimp dinner glad I didn't have to pay for it took two bites out of the shrimp half of them were burnt and the other half were somewhere looking size that one even what I ordered and raw or were barely cooked my son's order the shrimp were completely cooked in the fries look like garbage and more so greasy and nasty the salad they brought out look like the bowl had seen better days I want even a fed my dog out of the bowl like that needless to say we didn't finish our dinner there we ended up leaving my son got something to eat somewhere else I completely lost my appetite also be wary of getting the rolls there because they recycle their butter and I had butter that head somebody's old ketchup smeared all over it nasty save yourself the hospital bill for the stomachache and save your time and your money and go eat somewhere else you'll be better served that way."}
{"text":"We were on a bike ride and passed this place bristling with people on our way out for a bike ride, blowing away, in comparison, the activity at every other place we passed. Stopped here on a blisteringly hot day on the way home, we were both bordering on heat stroke, so our orders, a chicken club sandwich with onion rings and a turkey sandwich with lettuce tomato and mayonaisse with fries, weren't typical of what we saw leaving the kitchen. Contrary to the category into which someone opted to place them they may serve pizza, (don't know for sure), but that most certainly is not their raison d' etre. They call themselves a steakhouse, so pizza??!! First the bad news, the fries did not appear to be fresh-cut but rather frozen, and overcooked regardless. The good news, the turkey wasn't processed stuff held together with gobble-goo, it was actual turkey breast sliced and nicely stacked for a lighter-side gnosh. The chicken club was a freshly grilled chicken breast with a reasonable slap of cooked-on-site bacon on top and the rings were made on premise and quite good. The view, however, of the over-filled platters of fish, chicken, seafood platters, steaks and the like that came piling out of the kitchen for diners who had arrived in air-conditioned comfort, with unencumbered appetites  certainly gave one pause to contemplate a re-visit when we were similarly inclined to dine more heartily. Feeling that we hadn't adequately sampled full-blown dinner fare is in large part the reason for the three stars rather than four.  It's a bit difficult to accurately judge a place that serves a full cadre of home-style cooked fare through consumption of a couple of sandwiches, but we certainly werren't disappointed with the fare we ordered."}
{"text":"Good food! Friendly service! Don't go expecting a 5 star restaurant. It's a small homey environment! All of the staff seem to help one another anytime I have been there. Great team work!  I wouldn't say my kids are picky, but they are very honest, even they ask if we can go there to eat!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I don't take the kids out all that often, so in our search of a family friendly place to try out, we saw this one.  When you first see the place, it is a very nice mom & pop stop.  As long as you're there to eat and not for fancy decor or entertainment, your good to go.  No TV, no free Wi-Fi.  Just nice and simple.  The decor is lacking in update, so it greatly reminded me of a granny's house, but the staff is friendly and efficient.  The place in clean and neat, and for the most part, it's seat yourself.  Basic fair, but I wouldn't go calling it a 'steakhouse.'  Do NOT expect Roadhouse type steaks for food.  They serve steak, but we didn't even order that.  They have a basic kid's menu, and when my oldest son asked for something that wasn't on the kids menu, they couldn't even make an adult dish in a smaller size to accommodate.    My oldest son, who wanted popcorn shrimp, had to order the adult dish since they didn't make it as a kid's portion.  While it tasted fine and was brought out hot, lack of accommodation was frustrating.  My youngest son ordered the kid's spaghetti.  I was shocked at the size, because it looked like an adult serving and it was extremely liquidy.  Like they forgot to drain the noodles.  It tasted fine.  Nothing glorious or mouth-watering about it.  It was fine, ok, I could've made it at home flavor.  Comes with a side of garlic bread.  My husband ordered their fried fish, which is their Friday special.  It came with 2 sides.  He absolutely loved the mac & cheese.  It looked fantastic.  The fish was fresh and came out hot.  Simple breading, nothing over the top.  2 large fillets.  I ordered their fish sandwich, another Friday special.  The fish itself was fantastic, but it was so juicy it made my bun soggy and gross.  I hate soggy buns, so I was disappointed in my sandwich.  Comes with fries.  We ordered a basic dinner and it was just...OK.  I can't understand where people are giving this place 4 or 5 stars.  We probably won't even go back."}
