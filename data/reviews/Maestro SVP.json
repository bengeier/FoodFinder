{"text":"We were looking for a good place to eat while on vacation in Montreal. After seeing a few Yelp reviews, we were concerned that we wouldn't be able to get a table on such short notice. Turns out a reservation wasn't at all necessary.  After being seated, we quickly decided on the Cold Seafood Platter and a bottle of 2011 Côtes-du-Rhône Rosé. The Cold Seafood Platter was incredibly fresh and delicious. My favourite items were the crab legs and the tuna tartare, although there wasn't a weak item on the platter.  For dessert, we ordered oysters with Grand Marnier granite. The order was  forgotten, but we were still enjoying our wine, so it wasn't a big deal. I will however, dock a single star for it. Eventually they arrived, our server apologized and told us they would be free of charge. For that I will award them a bonus star!  Overall, service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful. And while the bill ended up coming to about $140, it was easily the best meal I had that weekend. I'm almost definitely going to come back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"A great place to come for oysters! Their cooked menu is also great, and their all you can eat mussels is a real bang for your buck. But you should really try their seafood platter! We had it for hubby's birthday awhile ago, and it's one of the best we've ever, ever tried. Though it's pricey, I believe it's worth it for the amount of seafood that you get!"}
{"text":"An oyster lovers dream! In this case, my friend who has an obsession with oysters celebrated his birthday at Maestro SVP.   We were quite late for our reservation but they were very understanding and welcoming. Our party of 6 was the biggest in the resto that evening yet, it was very homey and welcoming. Behind us, a chalk board with the varieties of oysters provided demanded attention - and deciphering for oyster noobs like myself. Luckily, our waiter whom was very knowledgeable patiently explained the main differences and directed us towards a certain kind. He constructed a platter , which was delicious and varied.   We decided to share a large platter along with entrees and main courses, so we might have ordered a tad much but it's was all so delicious!!! I must say the tuna Tartar stole the show for me! As well, they are known for their oyster shots-yes a shot with an oyster plopped at the bottom! Those were fun an enjoyable! There are even desert oysters with Grand Marnier for you true oyster lovers.   We overstayed past closing (I AM SO SORRY FOR THIS) but we're treated so cordially and felt no pressure at all. This restaurant is a little pricier but if you have a passion or want to deepen your knowledge on oysters and similar seafood, Maestro SVP is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I decided to go to Maestro SVP since my fiance loves oysters.  From all the reviews I had some high expectations.  The place was classy with white linens, had a number of blackboards with a list of their oysters, their \"hall of fame for most oysters eaten\" etc and exposed brick walls.  Service was sufficient so no complaints there.   We came during a week night so their happy hour special of a dozen Beausoleil oysters for $13 was available.  We ordered that, their hot seafood platter ($75) and their carmalized salmon in a miso marinade ($9) off their tapas menu. The oysters were fresh and tasty - we both enjoyed them. The salmon was also very good with a light crispiness on the outside and flakey.    We didn't enjoy the platter that much, which was unfortunate because there was just so much in it.  It included: bruschetta, snow crab, clams, steamed mussels, coconut shrimp, fried calamari, 1/2 lobster,  chicken and shrimp satays.  5 sauces were available for dipping: garlic butter, lime butter , cayenne/gin, Thai peanut, and orange horseradish.  We didn't have the peanut sauce due to allergies. The bruschetta was delicious. It had a layer of cheese and the tomatoes were fresh.   The drawback on the platter was the coconut shrimp, chicken & shrimp satays and mussels. There was way too much coconut batter for the shrimp. In the beginning I removed half the batter but then by the 2nd one, I just removed all of it.  Coconut overload - you couldn't really taste the shrimp.  The satays' meat was dry and the mussels weren't very flavourful. Just mushy and the sauces couldn't save them.   I'd stick to oysters if I go back."}
{"text":"On mondays Maestro SVP has an \"all you can eat\" mussels special. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! Served with fries and mayo, your order of mussels comes with a choice of sauce. I started off with the classic white wine sauce.   Aromatic in shallots and garlic, the brother complimented the mussels which were substantial and fresh. I finished one order and decided to hit another one to try the other sauce.   After my second round of the basil and honey sauce, started to slow down. My valiant effort was halted before I could challenge the third sauce - the marinara."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Open till very late, good choice if you are a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"Went to Maestro svp this weekend while in Montreal. Came across it online and it seemed to have good reviews.   I can confirm that those reviews were completely accurate! The food was delicious, the atmosphere stylish yet welcoming, and the service was more the pleasant.   We had crab cakes which were without a doubt the best I've ever had and I've had a lot!   We had the scallop appetizer and it was also super tasty and flavourful, albeit there was only 3 on the plate, the flavour more than made up for it.   We then had a couple dozen oysters. They have a happy hour where NB oysters are only $16 for a dozen and then we ordered another dozen of other types of oysters. All were delicious and fresh.   Finally we initially were going to order some fish but realized that we went on their all you can eat mussel night. Amazing! I think it was around $20 for the all you can eat! Can't beat the price plus they had 3 different sauces that you could order. A different sauce with each round if you wanted. My fav was the white wine sauce. It was lovely.   It looks like they also had a nice menu of fun and interesting cocktails but alas I was unable to indulge that night.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes seafood and fish! I will go back again next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We chose this spot to celebrate our 2nd anniversary on New Year's Eve.  The festive decor was beautiful. As a local, I always enjoy peeking at the display of oyster shells on the vestibule walls. These have been signed by celebrity guests and patrons from far and wide.  We started with some delicious oyster shooters (oyster, vodka, lime, coriander, tabasco), along with a tasty green salad and two cooked oysters. I enjoyed the Thaï shrimp for my main course, and my partner had a beautiful and generous serving of moules frites.   The service was good, although a bit rushed and terse at times. Regardless, we'll definitely return soon to take advantage of the 5 à Huîtres special!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for the first time and were very unfamiliar with what to do and where to eat. So when it came to a place to dine, we relied on Yelp as it has helped us out before while in a new place. We really wanted seafood, and oysters in particular. One restaurant jumped out at us and had received high ratings...Maestro S.V.P. We called to see if reservations were needed for just two people...we were pleased that none were needed...perhaps because it was late evening on a Tuesday. When we arrived, the restaurant had many guests, but we were pleased to be seated immediately. The first course of action was to order the happy hour oysters...a dozen for just $13! Then we perused the extensive wine list and ordered a lovely bottle of French Pinot Blanc...to go with the seafood. Perfect. We then had to decide on dinner. The menu had a lot to offer, but were particularly pleased with the tapas menu, which we understand to also be offered Tues-Thurs all night long. Again, perfect, as we love to try different items rather than to be limited to just two entrees.   There was so much food from which to select that we became a little confused...\"What to order?\", \"What is best?\", \"How much is too much?\". It was those questions that we presented to our server, who was ever so pleasant and knowledgeable. She helped us to select the perfect arrangement of tapas to meet the discretion of our palate. Being friendly, we asked her name...to which she responded \"Ilene\". I had remembered her name as being the owner, from the Yelp reviews. She confirmed that she was. This made us even more impressed...Ilene, a working owner, who is genuinely helpful and friendly with her guests...big points!!   All of the tapas we ordered were delectable!! Of special note; however, was the calamari (Ilene said it was a must order and I'm glad we followed her advice), the port & blue cheese baked oyster (words can't describe!), the Cajun seafood (unbelievable! We even had to wind up ordering bread because we simply could not pass on every bit of the broth!), and the Thai curry vegetables. Everything was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!   We highly recommend this restaurant! The food and service were without flaw. The ambiance was perfect as well...it had the perfect balance of casual and sophistication that would make any guest feel at ease. Next time we are in Montreal, this restaurant will be on our \"must do\" list!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down.  The BEST Seafood I have had in Montreal  We ordered the Maestro seafood platter for 2  It's huge! Comes with 5 different dips Has everything from shrimp, grilled and fried, clams, crabs, half a lobster, fried calamari  And bruschetta   We are coming back for oysters later"}
{"text":"Environment is nice. The food is very good... Lovely oyster and mussels. Service is on average. Recommend people should try this restaurant and must eat oyster."}
{"text":"Première  visite et sûrement pas là dernière.  Le service a été un peu lent, mais l'attente  a valu la peine.  De l'entrée  au dessert, un organe à chaque bouchée pour mes papilles gustatives."}
{"text":"We're budget travelers but stumbled on this place and couldn't resist the $15 all you can eat mussels. Yum! They have three different sauces but I liked the Cajun the best. The mussels special is only on Sundays and Mondays, but if you happen to be in Montreal on those days, it's a superb value."}
{"text":"Awesome place for dinner.  Great atmosphere and service.  The food was fantastic and great wine selection.  We thoroughly enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"This past weekend, a New Yorker and her Torontonian friend went to Montreal to ring in 2012. We played the whole weekend by ear, wandering around town on New Years Eve day and spending the evening drinking wine on a mostly deserted and fully freezing St. Helen's Island. After returning to our lodgings at Hotel Zero 1 to warm up and relax, the Torontonian got a hankering for oysters. She'd read about Maestro SVP during previous oyster restaurant researchings, so we decided to give them a call to see if we could make a last-minute New Years Eve reservation. The New Years gods must have been looking down on us, cause Maestro SVP had plenty of room for us and an awesome special menu.   The New Years menu had 4 courses, with a few items to choose from for each course (except the dessert). The menu was totally in French, which presented a tiny challenge considering that my efficiency in French is limited to guessing what things mean based on context clues; however, our waitress was very cool about translating things for me when I got stuck. My friend and I took full advantage of our options and shared our orders. For the first course, we got the salmon and tuna tartare (which came with wonton chips) and the salmon ceviche (which had guacamole on top). Totally hit the spot! We followed that up with baked oysters and cold shredded duck over a bed of shredded carrots, which had a yummy cole slaw kind of taste to it. Then came the main event. We rang in 2012 with a big plate of tasty cold seafood on ice (shrimp, oysters, mussels, tuna tartare, and a lobster) and a complimentary glass of champagne. Then, to top the night off, dessert was a chocolate lava cake with raspberry sauce and fresh whipped cream.  Couple all that with a bottle of Pinot Blanc and some New Years noisemakers and hats, and we ended up having ourselves the exact New Years celebration that we were hoping for (and another customer got herself an engagement ring as well!)."}
{"text":"Great Service, Oysters, and wouldn't hesitate to stop back in if I'm ever up in Montral again.  My friend and I were visiting Montreal on a random Wednesday night. The only thing we new of Montreal was to check out Old Montreal and St.-Laurents. My friend and I ended up strolling into Maestro and like the rest of the entire street it wasn't very busy.  We were very pleased with the oysters and amazed by the selection.  What separated Maestro from almost every other restaurant I've ever eaten at, is that the owner actually sat down and talked to us after shucking some oysters for us. She wasn't trying to sell anything, but was simply amazingly friendly and gave us so much information about her place and all of Montreal.  In an age of corporate restaurants and distant owners, it was a pleasant change to sit down at Maestro SVP."}
{"text":"I don't pay $80 a person for an okay meal to go into a women's bathroom and be confronted with an add for a medication for cystitis.  I thought this was Canada not the US.  This restaurant has sold its bathroom door space to an over the counter pharma company that wants you to deal with the suffering -- burning, itching, and other assorted tortures of this scourge of the female anatomy.  I want a nice dinner with my husband without this junk staring me in the face. The food was not that good and this was outrageous.  Take down your ad and I might consider visiting you again.  (the men's room also had an ad but for insurance)"}
{"text":"Maestro SVP is worth every penny and the proprietor, Ilene, runs the place like clockwork.  Come here for the oyster happy hour (12 beausoleil for $13) for sure, it is really a great deal. The happy hour is (according to the website)   every day from 11am to 7pm and all night on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  I've never eaten their a-la-carte menu, but from what I hear the Maestro platters are to die for, particularly the cold one.  I reserved a New Year's Eve dinner at Maestro back in 2007. $80 a person back then got us a small but tasty appetizer and soup and three Malpeque oysters. The next creation to land on our table blew my mind.  It consisted (for each person) of a platter no shorter than two feet where, on a bed of ice, were resting a bowl of mussels, two enormous tiger shrimps, half a lobster, half a snow crab and a few side garnishes.  I am a good eater, as many of my friends will attest. I struggled to finish the plate despite it being heavenly. The cracking sounds from those crab legs shattering and the surgical removal of that tender flesh were satisfying beyond belief.  Even on a busy night Ilene will keep guests entertained and will strike up some conversation.   As for wine, trust your instinct and tastes. I dig the Orvieto Classico Melini. It used to be the cheapest wine on their list, now they've added some more. It's definitely good. My preference for it stems from my inherent Italian bias. But that is OK, since Italy is to good food what America is to capitalism.  Maestro is one of those restaurants that make Montreal so awesome."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant! We had the Maestro seafood platter which was excellent - but certainly only attempt on an empty stomach! Food was fresh and tasty - even the bruschetta seemed original. We went on a quiet Sunday, but the service was friendly, helpful and not intrusive - which was perfect. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was great. They let our dog lay under our table on the patio, it was late Friday night and we were the only ones sitting there. It was nice and convenient, considering we intended to get takeout.   Service was quick and efficient, and the wine list was one of the most reasonable I've ever seen. We had a tasty Muscadet for under $60!   We had the Seafood Platter for 2, while it was tasty and a good value for the price, I've had better elsewhere. The oysters specifically were way too small, I understand they're basic Beausoliels, but most were the size of nickels. If I were to find myself in Montreal again, I'd fill up on their much bigger selection of oysters, rather than get the platter.   Overall it's a nice spot, and the tiny patio facing St. Laurent certainly made for an interesting evening!"}
{"text":"L'endroit se spécialise en huîtres. C'est parfait pour les amateurs, mais aussi pour ceux qui, comme moi, ne s'y connaissent pas beaucoup et voudraient découvrir un peu leur palette de goûts. Parce que oui, les huîtres offrent des saveurs et des textures complètement différentes d'une variété à une autre! Le personnel qualifié se fera un plaisir de vous suggérer ou de vous présenter différentes variétés afin de vous éclairer.  En plus des huîtres qu'on retrouve dans son assiette, mais aussi sur les murs, dans les vases et sur la poignée de l'entrée, l'endroit offre plusieurs plats de fruits de mer et quelques uns de poissons. Je vous recommande, entre autres, la chaudrée de palourdes.  Presque chaque soir, le restaurant offre un spécial différent. Par exemple, le lundi les moules sont à volonté, le mardi et le mercredi, le menu régulier laisse place à un menu tapas. Etc.  Pour ce qui est des desserts, essayez le gâteau aux trois laits! Un délice!"}
{"text":"I went for the happy hour oysters which were delicious but I don't think I had one oyster without shell in it. I also enjoyed the calamari which was nice and crispy but very bland. I've had much better for much less and the service was very agressive for an empty restaurant. Also, the waitress gave me an incorrect price for the wine she suggested and no information about which oysters I was recieving."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Montreal. Ilene (owner) is great. Genuine atmosphere, amazing oysters, great service. We spent our birthday dinner there while on getaway weekend watching the Rogers Cup final. Took a chance on this place. We live in Boston and know oysters. This place was better than we had at home. Ilene chose a great selection for us. We had some prosecco and house mignonet to go with. Perfect evening."}
{"text":"Top seafood food, one of the best I've had. We tried clams, muscles, oysters and all were wonderful.  For couples or groups; try Marstro's platter for 2.... and brace yourselves for a real feast.. It has shrimps, calamari, some more clams and muscles, crab and finally lobster all served with 5 different dips that will certainly leave you smiling.  Great place, staff and food. A definite treat!"}
{"text":"Orgasmic. Every morsel is a prize. Made the trip here from New Hampshire several times over the past few years -- every time we are transported to another dimension. Everything raw is highly recommended, as are the flambeed scallops Madagascar and the mussels."}
{"text":"We came by last evening, for some oysters and dinner. We loved the oysters, but the service left much to be desired. The girl had a very unprofessional demeanor, the plates were thrown on our table and when the wine was poured she splashed it, didn't even say sorry. When we didn't leave a big tip, she seemed mad. I always leave a really good tip when the service is good, but from a place that is on the finer dining experience, I expected better service."}
{"text":"This was an excellent restaurant for an oyster lover.  They served a wide variety and offered recommendations based on palate."}
{"text":"First time I had the pleasure of eating here was a couple years ago.. We have been back numerous times, I've taken family visiting from out of town, business associates, friends etc.. If you're visiting Montreal and want amazing seafood, come to this restaurant. Huge oyster selection, great food."}
{"text":"Love it!!! I'm going there as a regular since over 4 years now and always entirely satisfied! Food is sooooo tasty, they have the best oysters in town and the service is great! I'll keep going back again and again!"}
{"text":"After leaving Kazu, we thought we should grab some foods for \"men\". Then we took the advantages of happy hour in Maestro SVP. 18$ for dozen of oysters is a pretty fair deal.  Just take this restaurant as an oyster bar and you will not be disappointed, no more. After having 3 dozens of oysters and fried calamari, which means we've paid more than 80 dollars (for 2) on it, we still had to find some place to comfort the stomach.     The goods: fresh oysters all served Not good not bad: happy hour deal only offers beausoleil oysters(a bit small).  The cons:starters and plats are pricey"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Our hotel recommended this cute little spot for dinner and we absolutely loved it. The food is amazing, and the service even better.  Our server Joel, was super friendly, a true gem! He took really good care of us throughout the evening. Highly reccomend the mussels in white wine, cream & garlic as well as the grilled oysters. The Rockefeller was my fav. And don't forget about dessert, the trio crème brule is to die for! It has 3 flavors, Baileys, Rum & Lavender. Will definitely be back next time I am back in Montréal"}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in seafood the food was terrible. We had the seafood platter for two and everything was over cooked. The mussels, lobster, crab, shrimp all over done and dry. The calamari was non-existent, we basically were given fried batter. We also ordered oysters and they were bland. When the oysters were initially brought to us no condiments were given only lemon. If you are that confident in your oyster quality why the heck do they suck? For the prices this place was charging you would expect better quality. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for good seafood."}
{"text":"- beautiful spot for oysters: about 15 varieties on the daily chalkboard from kumamotos, to fanny bay, to beausoliel.... - great servers... but slow kitchen. its worth the wait, but there definitely could be some improvements made to speed of the kitchen. - make reservations. this place gets jammed"}
{"text":"I attended the UYE Ae shucks event that was hosted at SVP Maestro. It is primarily located in the clubbing district of St. Laurent st but do not let that discourage you from checking thus place out! The cute little shop that is worth the commute after work especially since it's been around over 17 years in Montreal.   Decor was simple and dimly lit. Great bar setup. We had a table in the back for our party of 5. I ordered a bloody Caesar 12$, and the happy hour special of a dozen Beau soleil oysters for 20$. Get two more free oysters when you check in with your yelp app ;) that's a steal when these oysters go for 3$ a piece! I loved the toppings- with two types of hot sauce ( including a red and a green tomatoe based sauce) and a red wine and pepper corn slush. The Beau soleil oysters we had were tremendous! Great flavours.   Bill adds up pretty quickly but if you want quality for price - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had ultra high expectations, which left much room for disappointment.   I would still go back solely for oysters since they were great and their Madagascar scallops were quite good too... However, the tuna tartare was rather tasteless and unseasoned. My mom and cousin ordered the tuna steak, which they also found tasteless and not seared appropriately (rather, it came overcooked). The calamari was \"too small\" and tasted mostly of batter. Nothing seemed to hit the spot.  We all left somewhat unsatisfied and disappointed, so I hope next time makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food is very very very good. Before meal I was like ''ugh late lunch today'', then me and my friend finished every bit on the plates."}
{"text":"The staff were lovely and extremely helpful. They were able to accommodate our large group despite not having a reservation. The oysters were delicious as was the Maestro platter and scrumptious lavender crème caramel."}
{"text":"Thank you to Maestro SVP for making a romantic weekend in Montreal a success!  I heard from a friend that if you want to eat out in Montreal, you have to make a reservation. However, with limited wifi and no cell phone service, that can definitely be a struggle. After checking on OpenTable and seeing no availability, we decided to give it a shot and hope for the best.  Though there were two tables with 'reserved' signs, Maestro gave one of them to us! I was so excited. The decor is intimate - dim lighting, oysters hung up on their Wall of Fame, simple white tablecloths. The servers were all very charming and friendly, and kept us served with fresh tap water and warm bread.  We got the two promotional oysters by checking in on Yelp and ordered two more (YUM. YUM YUM YUM.) and ordered the Maestro Platter (Hot Platter) for two.  Holy shit.   This platter was HUGE. It was so much food and it was beautifully arranged! Even now, days after, I can still remember which sauce goes with what.  The marmalade = coconut shrimp Gin and Cheyenne (white sauce) = calamari Peanut sauce (sweet and brown) = shrimp satay Garlic butter = shellfish Lemon butter(?) = shellfish  The platter includes half a lobster, crab legs, TONS OF MUSSELS, clams, coconut shrimp, and calamari.   I literally inhaled the mussels, they tasted so good with the two butters. I wasn't a big fan of the calamari - too salty for me - but my boyfriend loved it. Guess it all worked out!   We both thought the coconut shrimp was just okay. Too much breading and dried coconut flavor, not enough shrimp.   The crab and lobster were delicious and the meat came out super easily.   Hats off to Maestro, we'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Tried their seafood platter for two, the beausoleil oysters (complimentary through Yelp's offer) and a watermelon rum cocktail. Everything was to our liking, and the two butter sauces among the five that come with the platter are really impressive. Impeccable service as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely best oyster bar ever been, omg, so fresh and yummy. We got the mussels as well and another hit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing. Seriously the best food I've had in Montreal. Get their signature dish for 2. Loved this place."}
{"text":"It's a elegant place for seafood lover. Nice service. A dozen of oysters & cold seafood platter were so fresh and delicious , though the bill was pricey."}
{"text":"Soyons franc. Nous avons pris un plateau de fruits de mer pour deux et 2 verres de Sancerre. Huîtres ok mais 3 par personne et elles sont minuscules. 1/4 de homard chacun. Crevettes congelées sans goût. Sauces industrielles. Pas de mayonnaise maison. Bref si c'est frais c'est parce que c'était congelé. 147,00 $ de gaspillés. Resto à éviter pour les connaisseurs de fruits de mer. Pour ceux qui veulent découvrir les huîtres, peut-être mais c'est vraiment trop cher."}
{"text":"Slow and rude service coupled with food that was just ok at best. The portions were small and overpriced. The atmosphere left a lot to be desired with loud, out of date techno blasting."}
{"text":"In Montreal, this place is good not great. The oyster happy hour is 11 very small oysters for$20.00. They have a variety of others but very pricy. What I had was good, but for the value on seafood, you would be better off at Gibbys, which is outstanding and a great value."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very nice. My husband and I order 2 dozens of their oyster special. It was not as fat as I had hoped but this is probably due to the time of season that I went.   The seared scallops are probably one of the best I've had. The crabcakes were ok. I didn't order alot because we weren't really hungry and wanted to save room for dessert at Julliette et Chocolat.   I gave it 5 stars not only because of the food but the service. The owener was very attentive. Our bill wasn't significantly large but she was very nice and came by our table at least 5-6 times to see if everything was ok. On top of that the waitress came by to serve us at least 5-6 times during the meal.   Very cozy place. Will definately come back when I go to Montreal."}
{"text":"Les huitres sont excellentes et le menu intéressant....le service est lent et juste assez sympathique !"}
{"text":"Voici un resto de fruits de mer des plus agréables, à tel point qu'il attire de nombreux VIP dont vous pourrez apercevoir les autographes sur... des coquilles d'huîtres accrochées au mur dans le vestibule! On y vient pour la carte, qui offre une variété de petites grignotades de type tapas (mais de la tapas de luxe, hein!) entre 11h et 17h, ou encore pour un souper savoureux  et classe. Les plats sont bien préparés et témoignent d'une certaine recherche en cuisine, ce qui est toujours très agréable. Les produits sont frais, les assiettes généralement bien servies et le service est impeccable. En deux mots, on y mange pour cher, certes, mais on y mange bien. Vive les valeurs sûres!"}
{"text":"What better way to bring in my 27 years of life then to have it with a bunch of seafood!  I couldn't have made a better choice for this great restaurant to host my birthday. The waiting staff and amazing atmosphere were top notch and I loved the decore. I ordered with my friends a seafood player which was hugeeee but was perfect In every way!  Lobster, shrimp, calamari, mussels, and crab was cooked the perfection... with the option of oysters on the side.. ( I took 5 )  Nothing but great things to say! Bring the fam or that special someone :) you won't regret it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Mussels were very flavorful, oysters were great, the seafood pasta was excellent although it was mostly mussels and light on the shrimp and clams. The mahi-mahi mahi was done in a delicious sauce and the rissoto was excellent. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here during my quick weekend trip to Montreal and was the best decision to  stop by Maestro SVP for dinner. Shared a cold platter for two as well as the 20 oysters with a glass of white wine from France. The selections on the menu show by the bottle but you can always ask the selections by the glass. They had excellent ones so you can't go wrong with their recommendations. The cold platter was perfect portion, taste and freshness and the oysters were divine. Outdoor seating is great for a early evening dinner since the weather is perfect in June and they have lots of street events going on in Saint-Laurent Street. I have to say location, service, food was all perfect. Thanks to Maestro SVP for making this visit wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm grading on a curve here and factoring in the $175 tab (without dessert).  The food was OK.  Drink OK.  Service pretty good.  But my wife and I didn't get any memorable -- or even particularly impressive -- dishes during our evening at Maestro SVP.    The calimari appetizer was solid.  We had sea bass and grilled shrimp main courses, neither of which were notable.  Service was fine but no better informed or engaged than I'd expect the individual at my local Wahoo Fish Tacos to be.    Overall, this was a mediocre evening.  And for $175 in Montreal, you can do a lot better than mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here thinking I was just going to have a drink with a friend. Ended up staying for hours. The service was amazing. The oysters were delicious. The seafood was great as well. A small place, but designed and laid out well. Very intimate setting. Will definitely be a place we visit regularly when in Montreal"}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever visited. I was so obsessed with the food that I can't remember their interior or how the waitress looked like. I only remember that they have mezuzah on the front door.  The worst thing I've ordered there was a seafood pasta. Pasta itself was ok, and seafood was good, but it wasn't a dish - it was just pasta and seafood put one on top of the other. There are much better ways to prepare all the ingredients together  We shared a dozen of oysters. That was an experience full of pleasant surprises. I never thought that there is such a variety of different tastes.  And then there was a masterpiece - steamed mussels in blue cheese. That was something unbelievable. Beefy, dense mussels bathing in a tender sauce. I wish I've ordered a second portion instead of that pasta.  We had a good wine pairing, but I've forgotten to write down what wine we had.  Daughter had a kids version of pasta with tomato sauce, which I wouldn't order for myself, but she totally enjoyed it.  Overall experience was more than pleasant. A nice alternative to the posh restaurants in downtown."}
{"text":"Great happy hour special on raw oysters at 1 doz. for $16. DELICIOUS and a great beer suggestion, too. Pricey wine list, though. Stick to the beer. Perfect for a fancy, intimate date with someone you want to experience a little magic with."}
{"text":"The food was good especially the mussels with cream & white wine sauce. The oysters are fresh and tasty. However, it took so long to get our food. Don't come here unless you have a lot to talk about because you'll be here a very long time! We had 3 courses and it took more than 2hrs to finish our meal (not because theres a lot of food!)."}
{"text":"We came here for some oysters during happy hour. $20 for a dozen. They respect their Yelp check-in offer of 2 free oysters as well.  The oysters are delicious and fresh! Beautifully presented. In fact all the plates I saw leaving the kitchen were beautifully presented! I highly recommend their oysters. Really enjoyed the mignonette sauce. 5 solid stars!  We opted for some sides and I went with the calamari and the sangria cocktail. Unfortunately both of these fell well short of my expectations. The calamari plate was small and the calamari cut very small, into popcorn chicken style. Too much breading. I wasn't a fan of the dip with the calamari as well. The sangria wasn't the best mix I had and there was too much ice in a relatively small class. Not much value for the price asked. 2 stars.  Our host was great! She was attentive, funny and we were taken care of. 5 stars.  Price tag is a little high but you're paying for value here and I strongly recommend this place. Will be back for the oysters and maybe a main meal."}
{"text":"Super hip vibe, clean and cozy interior, and a menu focused on shellfish. (hint: ask for the menu in English).  This place is not cheap (average $4 per oyster), but worth the splurge. We did two of each on their chalk board, plus a terrific bowl of mussels.  The waitress was helpful and super cool, and the wine list above average.  Stop here for a \"meal\" like we did, and you'll leave with a smile..."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! I can't speak highly enough of this place! All you can eat mussels Sunday and Monday night, the owner was so sweet and super attentive. She gave us a platter of oysters so I could try different ones having never had oysters before and I highly recommend going here! Delicious food, great atmosphere and ambience and an owner who cares for her clients! If I could give it 7 stars I would!"}
{"text":"A few of us got together for an oyster happy hour to catch up and swung by Maestro in part due to reputation, and in part due to their $20/dz special. We were fortunate enough to also benefit from their check-in offer of 2 free oysters. Of the 14 I had, only 1 had any shell. They were well shucked and mignonettes as well as hot sauces were available upon request.   I enjoyed their house Caesar which came with it's own little shrimp, a nice touch particularly for the reasonable price of their cocktail. Their wine menu was reasonably priced and matched the quality of the food they prepare. Although the restaurant has a higher price tag than some other options nearby, the quality of food they use to prepare their dishes is apparent. They also have a number of particularly affordable options ranging from all you can eat mussels, oyster specials, and tapas specials dependent on the day and time of your visit (some on slow nights, some during happy hour, etc).  Our table split a few dishes, including calamari and crab cakes. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious however I could not bring myself to understand their calamari. Although I took no issue with the volume of calamari, the preparation struck me as not matching the rest of the menu. The calamari were cut very small and tossed in an oddly flavored orange-ish breading (and too thick). For the rest of the menu to be so fresh and well presented this stuck out to me as though I had ordered them from an entirely different restaurant.  We were fortunate to be served by Ilene herself (the owner) who was attentive, engaging, and even made a point of showing us the gorgeous plated dishes as they left the kitchen as we were seated right beside her path and she was aware of our curiosity."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday and had very friendly service. The first guy had a thick accent, so it was hard to understand him, but there was another lady who recommended I just have oysters with lemon. I ordered a dozen Beausoleil oysters for only 18$ (happy hour special) and it was yummy!   I asked the same waiter what he suggested for wine--Prosecco, sparkling wine that cost $13 a glass! It was expensive, but very delicious and went well with the oysters.  I also ordered the $16 1.5 lbs of mussels. I think that's really good price as it filled me up. The waiter recommended a flavor (it had tomatoes, celery and carrots) and he has good taste! I gobbled them up and had a great time. Mmm, seafood.  They had awesome service, and I felt like the food was delicious. It's a bit pricey, but they were friendly.  Definitely recommend the mussels - I feel like that was a great deal and I was super stuffed. They have an all you can eat mussels day - if you have time and a stomach to eat more than 1.5 lbs, I definitely recommend going.  Edit: Prosecco isn't $18, sorry for the mixup"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Lots of oysters. if you are a fan, go!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! We came because of the reviews. The owner was very knowledgeable about the oysters and was able to help us create a plate to our tastes. everything we ate was fantastic! The crab cakes, the soup, the oysters! YUM!"}
{"text":"Seafood restaurants in montreal = a big nono The setting of the restaurant was beautiful but not the quality of food Ordered the Louisana seafood and the flavour was absolutately terrible...no cajun flavour at all as it was very bland...the shrimps and scallop were big but they had no taste to it all it....i rather eat at a long john silvers than pay $34 for that entree  save your money and goto a different seafood restaurant"}
{"text":"Coconuts shrimp with horseradish and marmalade.  Raspberry Point oysters with Mignonette glacee au champagne"}
{"text":"Expensive and depending on what you order, you won't always feel full. That being said, the ambiance is great and the food is really top notch. Just frame your expectations and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The oysters were so fresh, but the service were not so good. Especially the owner!!! We ordered one of each kind of oyster just to taste first, but she gave us 4 of each! And after she came so mad at us saying she couldn't sell oysters like this and walked away. But it is not our fault and I don't think it's the right way to treat customer."}
{"text":"Being an oysters virgin i did not know what to expect. Fortunately our hostess was very helpful in guiding us through these salty waters (if you see the pun then you know it was intentional)  My inner food snob believes that Pacific ocean oysters from Washington state are quite superior. Also it was a Tuesday evening so the atmosphere was very calm and serene."}
{"text":"This place is a 5star seafood resto in my honest opinion! It's an oyster bar located on st laurent right next to big in japan and diablos. Street parking is hard since it's a very highly trafficked area. As soon as we walked in, the service: is absolutely phenomenal. The waiter was there to greet us and dressed in a fancy ensemble. Tables are very clean, cosy and superb. White tables with nice cutlery. The tables have The \"M\" engraved for \"Maestro\" it made me think of the emblem \"masterchef\" ahahaha so pretty.   I wish they had more cocktail selections.. They only had like 5 different cocktail options on the rocks :(  So if i had to complain i would only say to add more selection of cocktails on the menu. Tropical cocktails for the summer would be Amazing.   The food: what can I say ? Ummm DEEEELICIOUS. I was so happy about the check in offer. They gave us 2 free beausoleil oysters on the house. That made me get an idea of the freshness. Omg i also recommend you trying the baked Rockefeller oysters gratin with Suisse cheese. It was melting in my mouth. We decided to go for the cooked seafood platter for 2. Let me tell you it was HUGE!! We got almost all the different types of fish in one huge plate. It was So filling and i kind of regret ordering an extra grilled lobster platter. We had in total a 1lb lobster on the table. It was so easy to break it and descale it. Thats when you know the food is fresh and cooked to the ultimate perfection.  My cocktail was a watermelon and strawberry daiquiri.. It was not as sweet as I would have liked it but it was pleasantly delicious and you could taste the use of fresh fruits not frozen !  Overall, the service and food were spectacular and I was so happy to come here! I will definitely be back when Im craving more seafood!!"}
{"text":"My friends went to this restaurant last night on the recommendation of my wife. Sadly the wife of my friend collapsed and an ambulance was called. As my friend left with the ambulance, the waitress came and asked them to pay their bill. As they were rushing in a life or death moment, this restaurant still wanted their money.  So I called the owner/Manager and asked \"why would you do that\"? The lady said..\"do you expect me to pay\"?"}
{"text":"It was my turn on the Montreal trip to choose the restaurant and boy have I been striking out in Montreal! I booked us a reservation at Maestros on opentable hoping it would be comparable to Mastros in LA... no such luck.  The Tuna Tartare, just O.K.... a large hunk of cut up tuna with a pinch of seasoned salt on the plate and a couple very small nuggets of wasabi, served with wonton chips. Meh. Just OK.  The Crab Cakes, just meh. The cakes themselves were a little mushy -- not thoroughly cooked. They're also served with a \"citrus\" sauce... if you can call it that. It's more of an orange sauce that tastes infused with a curry flavor -- which sounds good enough, and it was-- just not with the crab cakes-- at all. It completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the undercooked cake and just made everything taste worse.  The 1/2lb of Mussels, again, meh. The mussels were thoroughly cooked and served in their white wine sauce. The sauce was very light and almost non existent. I found myself constantly adding salt and pepper for some flavor to this otherwise bland serving of mussels. (Other people mention aromatic with shallots and garlic-- where? How come mine weren't aromatic-- i had no shallots or garlic, just a plain, bland white wine sauce)  The snow crab... meh. A set of snow crab legs served with a thimble of the worlds saltiest garlic butter known to man. The butter was gross, no joke -- and I loooovee butter. The crab legs weren't scored and were very messy.   The crab soup was just for lack of better term; stupid. 100% uninspired. It was basically a bouillon cube beef broth with a couple shreds of crab (very sparse), a few shreds of cilantro and carrot. A complete waste of $12.  Worth mentioning; I went to the bathroom and there was no toilet paper. Which was awful, but i had tissues in my purse. I told both the server and her bus boy that there was no toilet paper. They apologized and said they would take care of it.  30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom again (Don't judge, I was having alcohol-- I'm small-- this happens-- lol). I walk into the bathroom, shut the door... still no toilet paper. i tell the server again and wait while she gets the toilet paper and puts it in.  Also worth mentioning, there were 2 prostitutes or strippers that looked very unsavory dining at a large round table meant for 4 people, right in the front window of the restaurant. No problem, I just would rather not look at giant breasts and butt-cracks on parade while I'm supposed to be eating at a fine-dining establishment.  On the bright side: The scallops were actually petty good, just not very large specimens.   All things considered, if this were a \"Joe's Crab Shack\" and the dinner was $65 I'd have been O.K. with the meal. I feel like the price of a meal should reflect or temper the experience you're going to have as a patron of that establishment; but when you're paying $200 for a meal for 2, one expects a certain level of service and ambiance -- I really feel we didn't get what we paid for."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night with a few friends and we had an incredible experience! The staff was very knowledgeable, accommodating, and fun. Our waiter Enrique made oyster recommendations and we thoroughly enjoyed them! The food and cocktails were all amazing and worth the price. Julie was awesome and even used some connections of hers to get us into the bar across the street and cut the line. Overall the best dinner we had on our vacation! Super fresh and well-cooked seafood! Great for groups! We will definitely return on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"nice place for fresh seafood. They got all kinds of oyster and now it's the time for snow crab. The lobster is also tasty. We ordered the seafood pasta and scallops. The scallops is pretty good but the pasta has a wired taste which is not appreciable."}
{"text":"I would not go to crazy about this place and give it a 5 star.  Yes it is very good and the cuisine is really tasty and their seafood menu is fantastic but all of that gets them a very good mark with some improvement in the value side and the staff responsiveness..."}
{"text":"Went for oyster happy hour and had a bottle of wine. Service was great and very cute place. Oysters were okay, a hit briny for my tastes but I know others that prefer that taste."}
{"text":"Seafood place with fresh oysters. Recommend the scallop ceviche and seafood pasta. Great service."}
{"text":"My partner and I drove to Montreal from Michigan to do a food tour and added this place to our list to have our fill of some oysters. It was actually our first stop after our very long and snowy journey, so we particularly appreciated the warm ambience and nice service. We ordered an assortment of raw oysters, all of which were delicious, and shared the Madagascar mussels (cream, brandy and poivre vert - so good) and a shrimp/onion appetizer that I can't remember the English name of (sorry Yelpers :( ). Did seem a bit pricy so we knocked off a star, but overall the restaurant was lovely and we would recommend it to anyone else looking to have a nice seafood dinner in Montreal."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious seafood! I got the cold seafood platter for two and it had a great selection with some yummy accompanying sauces, and came with a starter salad. I ordered a bruschetta as well to start, which was great. The servers were very knowledgable and gave great service. To finish, I shared a dessert plate that was a sampling of three or four desserts (an apple pie, creme brûlée, milk cake, and maybe something else), which were all divine"}
{"text":"Made a reservation through their website. Showed up with a baby and they mysteriously \"lost\" the reservation. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The only thing I purchased here: 'sters. They have SO many kinds and clearly take pride in serving a variety of supremely fresh bivalves. But at $4-6 a pop, I kept it to a dozen Beausoleils for $16. The happy hour special happens daily (including weekends), I think from 4 pm until 7 pm.   The Beausoleils rocked my world. They were EXCELLENT, shucked perfectly, fresh, flavorful."}
{"text":"Maestro SVP is known for their fabulous oysters and they should be as their are awesome. They stock a number of different varieties daily which are Always changing. Their standard 'house' oysters are Beausoleils which are excellent on their on and even better when topped with their hot or cold toppings. They also have a excellent happy hour deal on oysters- best time to visit!"}
{"text":"A whole lotta 'meh'. I came in here expecting something reeeeally, reeeeally good based on what a few people had told me, but I left with a shrug and a very hefty bill. The oysters here are quite good as are the oyster shots (get the coriander one, it's deelish), the tuna we ordered was tasteless, the calamari was almost all batter and the seafood platter was mediocre at best with the scrawniest crab leg I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Incredible Oyster bar, fantastic seafood, great hip fun vibe and an amazing date spot.  The P.E. Isl.'s and the Salmon were to die for.  Plus it's right on Saint-Laurent which makes hitting the bars, lounges and clubs afterward a breeze.  The local oysters are fresher than we ever get them on the west coast so we took advantage (plus the prices are the reverse, geographically, from what we are used to)  Incredible bartenders too (seriously, she came to our table from the bar to make anything we wanted so you aren't force to play the telephone game with your waitress). owner came to our table twice as well.  simply amazing service.  my advice is to MAKE A RESERVATION. this place gets packed after 7 and there are only 12-16 tables. we got lucky and got seated immediately but not more than 5 minutes later the line was past the window.  ps: not to seem to snooty, they keep a record of the most oysters consumed on the wall (which, give their dozen oyster happy hour specials for like 16 CAD, is VERY tempting to try and beat).   ...last saw it at 73.   Challenge accepted."}
{"text":"The only place in Montreal to get oysters as far as I am concerned.  As a regular client I am biased in that this is my regular go to place for oysters, I enjoy going there with friends and having as many dozens as we can, with a great wine selection or the occasional bottle of champagne.  The owner Ilene and all her attentive staff make you feel welcomed and are always available to help you find new things to try, the Rockefeller oysters are an example. The price is very reasonable and the leisurely atmosphere is great to make any occasion special and memorable, (unless you over indulge in the oyster shooters), and during the summer months the outdoor seating is a great place to people watch, but the very elegant decor is very soothing in winter as well."}
{"text":"In the interests of full disclose, the owner is my cousin. That said, I've eaten at MSVP at least a dozen times since it opened, and enjoyed it thoroughly every time.  The chowder is as good as you are going to get outside of Boston; the oysters fresh and delicious.  The seafood platter is fantastic. At my birthday last year, I asked Ilene to surprise me, the offerings were out of this world. Which reminds me, I should make a reservation for next month ..."}
