{"text":"Ordered meat lovers for delivery. All pizza is yummy and this was yummy too and worth trying  but at end of day liked others better. Thin crust (not that there's anything wrong with that) and delicious spicing."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza with the best crust I've tasted in a looong time. 4 of us went before seeing a movie and the man working asked us if we were seeing a show and promised to get our two pizzas ready as quickly as possible without us even bringing it up.  We ate our pizzas there, and we're brought China plates and napkins. The dine - in seating is roomy, but more like a Mr. Sub/Subway type seating. If it offered a bit more ambience I would probably go there regularly with friends or on a date night before seeing the show.  All in all, tasty food plus genuinely friendly and helpful service made this place a win."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I like the thicker crust and extra sauce at no charge. Lasagna is good also. Take out and delivery. Only one cramped table unfortunately."}
{"text":"The pizza quality and service is reliable. We find it tasty. It's been a family choice for as long as I can remember probably since the place opened. Meat lover and gourmet are our favorites."}
{"text":"Pizza is nothing to write home about. The store is really dirty and should be closed to clean it up. When the magazine  left out to read while you wait are from 2010 you know this place is being neglected. . The staff was on the phone when we walked in and did not acknowledge us for a full 3 min. If you are taking orders I understand but this was clearly a personal call that switched to a foreign language shortly after we walked in. Pizza goes through the conveyor oven and is barely cooked when it comes out asking for more well done got us a huff and eye roll. It unfortunate that they have to have so many specials in order to move low grade product. What happened to quality."}
{"text":"Just returned from trying the steak sandwich.  These are really not good.  They were swimming in oil and the steak was thin and full of fat.  It came topped with some raw red onion and slices of mushroom. The menu says they will come with peppers, but they didn't.   The bun was good but that got lost with how bad the steak was.  Since this is a pizza place, I guess we should have stuck with that as the reviews here are quite positive when it comes to the pizza.    Will I try it again?  No."}
{"text":"Sorry I just didn't care for it at all. The crust tasteless and the pizza in general was sub par. I purchased a med pizza and brought it home. I had one slice and threw the rest out in the garbage. I wanted to like it but I won't be getting pizza from there again."}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza's from here twice now, and so far have really enjoyed our pizza. My family is always trying to find new pizza places since we often get tired of going to the same place.   We've ordered the Smokin' Hot Hawaiian, the BBQ Steak, the Santa Fe Supreme, and the Buffalo Chicken. So far, our favourite was been the hawaiian one, as it was an extremely tasty hawaiian pizza. When we ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza, it was more bbq tasting than hot sauce. I'm not sure if we just got the wrong pizza, or if their hot sauce just isn't hot and more sweet. Regardless, we've enjoyed everything we've ordered. Our family likes the crust, it's on the thinner side, yet doesn't get soggy from the toppings, and the crust remains crispy.   Both times we did pickup instead of delivery, and it's been ready in 20 minutes. Ordering two large pizza's is under $40 which isn't too bad, and the owners have always been nice while going in to pick up. When we want a change, this is somewhere we will order from, since we enjoy the creativity when it comes to their pizza's!"}
{"text":"The word Gourmet is a little misleading, it's just your regular kind of pizza. Still good though."}
{"text":"I would definitely order from here again. The wings were great -- awesome flavour. The pizza sauce was awesome -- sweet, just like I like it! The potato wedges were good but the garlic bread was great - yum! Cheese stuffed inside.. who could complain? The family meal deal comes with a good amount of food. The only negatives I have that take away one star are the price -- more than your Pizza Pizza (but then again most pizza places are and all of them taste better, too). Secondly, the crust of the pizza, which is kind of important. It is very dry. Consider it the opposite of Pizza Hut crust. It was also slightly sweet which turned some people in the group off."}
{"text":"I had a craving for two food items: spaghetti and pancakes. They didn't have to be consumed together!   I had originally wanted to stop by Wimpy's for lunch, but it was extremely busy just after 1 pm. Instead, I walked a bit to figure out what stores are next to it. I found Santa Fe Gourmet Pizza.   I reviewed a large list of different pizzas that was posted on the store window. I then looked at the graphical menu and was pleased that it had two types of spaghetti.   I walked in and ordered spaghetti with meatballs. I also ordered a can of Diet Coke. The person working there was helpful and friendly. I ordered takeout. He told me that my order would take about nine minutes.   My bladder was screaming at me. All I will say is that the washrooms are clean and my bladder was thankful.   You can dine in. I sat down and watched a soccer (English football) game on the telly. Sure enough, nine minutes had passed and my order was ready.   Mt takeout order was carefully packed. He included a knife and fork, and a bunch of napkins.  The spaghetti and meatballs was a decent size. Lots of fresh diced tomatoes were in the sauce. The meatballs were cute and the perfect size. The pasta was al dente. It was good.   It came topped with both parmesan and grated mozzarella cheese. I'm not a cheese devotee, so I took some of the latter off.   My order also came with small garlic breadsticks. They were a pleasant, yummy surprise. Delicious!  The place also has wings. I'd come back to try more food. It was a great find on a rainy day.
