{"text":"Friday night. Craving bi bim bop. Thought our only option would be Meiga this late, but yelp told me otherwise :)

Ha Anh is a very small hole in the wall Korean restaurant. Hidden in the same location as superior pho. Legit Korean speaking owners. The decor looks new. Cleaner inside then expected. 

Tea served when asked. Korean with some Japanese options on the menu. The bachan was limited, but tasty. My favorite was the mushroom. Instead of the steamed egg I'm use to having, they served small omelet patties. It was good, but cold. The bi bim bop was typical. Not sure if it was worth the $11. Could have used more rice. I prefer going to Meiga because you can order the bi bim bop with the beef ribs. 

Not a bad experience. I wouldn't mind coming back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"This wasn't what I would call a good \"hole in the wall\" korean shop....menu had very few korean dishes, and an even smaller selection of meats."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst korean restaurants I've ever been to. I have gone to almost all Korean restaurants in Ohio and this has BY FAR been the worst. Horrible service, even when they're not busy. Confused servers. Bad food. I ordered bibimbap, NO FLAVOR. Whatsoever. Not authentic or exotic. No flavor . The bulgogi was a dish you couldn't ruin, and somehow they ruined that dish too. The only people who would like this place , are people with bland tastebuds. I recommend any other place ."}
{"text":"This place is kind of small, which is why it lost one star. Other than that, the food is good and price is right. I especially like the sushi there. The sushi is authentic Korean, which is different from the Japanese one which is regular in US. The sushi tastes exactly like those I had back in Seoul. Which is wonderful. The price is good too."}
{"text":"Went to Ha Ahn specifically for the Hot Stone Bibimbap and we were not disappointed!  The staff was very friendly and greeted us as we came in the door. We ordered a volcano roll to get started which was prepared well. It came with a salad and miso soup. Then they brought the appetizers (seaweed, egg/crab, sardines, kimchee, herbs) which were also delicious. All around this is a really good place and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Korean is starting to become my favorite type of food.  In downtown Cleveland, there are only three to choose from; Miega, Ha Ahn, and Korean Hotpot.  I have been to Miega four times, Ha Ahn twice, and Korean Hotpot none.  My first Korean experience was with Miega, and I thought their food was the best until I went to Ha Ahn tonight for the 2nd time.  I went tonight by myself, and even though I was alone, I still got six banchan.  This is unlike at Miega when I was alone one night, and I only got four banchan.  The banchan was a lot better and with more variety than at Miega too.  I had the usual kimchi and radish cubes, but I also received egg, another variation of radish, anchovies, and seaweed.  Ha Ahn also provides miso soup before your meal with the banchan that you can order a refill at no extra charge.  I'm already sold there.  Then the entree?  I ordered a squid dish that had onions and carrots in it with this spicy red sauce all over it.  It came on this sizzling plate.  This little yogurt drink came after the meal.  So many things provided, and in total the meal cost 13 with tax but without tip.  Sold, sold, sold.  I love Korean food, and this restaurant takes the cake.  Sorry, this was not well-written.  I will come back with updates and edits."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Ha Ahn on Monday because Miega was closed.  I got the salmon teriyaki bento and she got the udon bowl with tempura.  Everything especially the banchan was so fresh and delicious. Loads of large tempura to share. The waiter was super friendly and helpful.  We were the only ones in there he said because we came at that awkward time between lunch and dinner.  That will be our ideal time, because I believe it gets busy here based on the delicious food and reasonable prices.  It's nice to get Korean and Japanese fusion food in a small but quaint restaurant.  We will definitely visit more often now that we've found this gem."}
{"text":"Bad service from the old waitress! She seems lazy. She didn't clean the table or ask if we need box, even if the restaurant wasn't busy. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This was the most authentic Korean food I have had since I left Korea.  

While living in Korea I was eating Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop twice a week, while I cannot make it to Ha Ahn that much, the quality and authenticity is spot on (to include small tables next to huge glass windows)."}
{"text":"I was born in Korea and raised in LA and NYC. 

Ha Ahn in Cleveland is one of the Top Five Korean restaurants I've ever been to.

Truly authentic and every ingredient seems to be of the highest quality, and incredibly fresh."}
{"text":"the food here is great!!! i would recommend the spicy squid or the bibimbap...but the sometimes you get bad service, if the waitress is in a bad mood..."}
{"text":"As someone who has been to some of the best Korean restaurants on this side of the world, Ha Ahn can dish out some decent Korean cuisines. They usually serve 6 banchan dishes that change every time I've been there. The tofu soup isn't as fresh as I'm use to but the soup is still full bodied. My favorite is their galbi: not the traditional way with bone-in but served generously with a dark sweet teriyaki marinade. 

They also have good lunch specials but only served M-F. Great Korean restaurant if you don't want to drive all the way to Parma.

Tip: This gem is hard to find. It's in a tiny plaza with Superior Pho with a parking lot in the back, accessible via E 31st at Superior Ave."}
{"text":"We are visiting Cleveland, and have lunch here. It's a very authentic Korean restaurant. We liked it very much! The service is very nice!"}
{"text":"the best korean place in town???I have tried most of the Korean places in Cleveland. Most of them are ok, but have the same problem...... Too salty! 

This one is theeee best one!  Recommend their cold noodles and soft tofu soup^^"}
{"text":"Huge portions, authentic food, and fast service.

A little light on the sides compared to the Korean restaurants I've been to in the past, but the food is great.  Kimchee tastes amazing.  Staple bibimbap was great and tastes like back in Korea.

Hard to find but I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I liked their side dish including egg cake and kimchi. Very traditional korean food and their soup, tofu soup, yookgyejang, and bibimbab were excellent! I would come back again."}
{"text":"It's not bad.. but only people who have never tried Good Korean food can call this place good...
It's nice that they serve side dishes with all the food... but I think the food is not as flavorful as it should be, and a bit overpriced for the quality of the meat/food.

But there aren't any good Korean restaurants in Cleveland so there aren't many other options."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with my girlfriend and was actually quite impressed. We came for a late lunch when they were not very busy and our server was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the stir fried squid and my girlfriend ordered the bibimbap. Both of us were satisfied with our dishes and agreed that this is a place we would like to come back to revisit! I would definatly recommend this place to friends and family. The place is small but cozy with a very authentic feel."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time. Had the chicken teriyaki bento box. It came with chicken teriyaki, rice, salad,  California rolls and a seaweed salad.  The price was decent at 8.95.  The chicken was made with all dark meat and was just ok. It wasn't any better than what I've done at home.  The California rolls were good and so was the salad.  I didn't like the seaweed dish at all.   I wish the had a takeout menu as I sometimes have to really think about what I want or decide to try something new.  I would try them again as their customers appeared to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every diner gets complimentary tea and miso soup, and small appetIzers are brought to every table. Also complimentary. Service has always been friendly even though there has often been a language barrier between us. We make it work. Love the hot stone bi bim bap and yakgaejang. Generous portions, always leave happy."}
{"text":"This tiny place is in the same \"plaza\" as Superior Pho and that's how we found it--on a trek to Superior Pho. 

The standouts here are two soups:  Yukaejang and Galbi Tang. 

The Yukaejang is a savory soup (shreds of beef brisket, bracken--sea weed, enoki mushrooms, wood ear and maybe porcini mushrooms in dark red Korean chili pepper broth with glass noodles made from mung beans) - it's not crazy spicy, so don't be bashful. The Korean chili powder is finely ground and is ubiquitous in Korean cuisine. It imparts warmth and depth but won't impale your tongue like Thai chilis.  It was deeply satisfying and will heat you to the core.  

The Galbi Tang is a rich mild savory beef broth with beef bones, tendon-y beef, sliced daikon radishes that become slightly sweet and potato-ey in soup.  This is also served with glass noodles. Don't turn your nose at the tendon-y chewy beef on the bone--you're getting good healthy collagen from the soft cartilage and tendon and getting good nutrients from the marrow, so slurp it up!

The weather had been overcast, a little chilly, and then it rained. We needed warming Korean food and got it here in these two soups. 

We also ordered some standards: galbi (garlicky grilled ribs) and seafood pancake. These were good, not great, but good.  Both could have used a heavier hand with seasoning and garlic and a little less char on the galbi.

The rice was plump Korean white rice--piping hot and delicious and served in individual stainless steel tins. 

Before our meal, lots of tiny dishes -- banchan: kimchi, pickled golden beets and cucumbers, tiny fried dried fish with cranberries and sliced almonds (this one was a new one to me--kind of a yuppy twist for Korean), fried tofu cubes, superior fluffy, boiling hot steamed egg soufflé, and marinated mung bean sprouts. 

Salmon sashimi---my 6 year old ate 15 pieces (burrpmph--ooooo--not sure I could hold that down but he's nuts about salmon sashimi and can almost eat his body weight in raw salmon). 

My number one son had a Philly roll, caterpillar roll, manhattan roll, and octopus nigiri.

The sushi chef made a lovely roll of cucumber where the cucumber was sliced so thinly, he rolled it like nori around some crab and plated it with a light vinaigrette--and presented to us gratis!

We were so crazy full we couldn't walk right. 

On my second visit for take out to pick up Yukaejang and Galbi Tang to take to family recuperating at Cleveland Clinic, they even set me up with banchan to go!  Lovely, lovely folks.  The soup was so hot that when I got them to the hospital, the containers were warped! 

When next we find ourselves in Cleveland, we'll be back for these delicious soups."}
{"text":"Firs time there today. Got the pork bulgogi lunch special and yaki gyoza appetizer. The yaki was good and crispy. The bulgogi was really delicious and tender. A good portion for the lunch special too. I think the banchan is better at Korea House (they give you this egg soufflé at KH that is so yummy) but overall it was good. Also, our waiter was SUPER helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little place right next to Superior Pho. It's kind of easy to miss if you're not looking for it. I feel that Pho tends to out-shadow this restaurant, seeing how popular Superior Pho is. The overall dining area was clean, neat, albeit small. I don't recommend anyone to bring entire families and having a feast in this restaurant by any means.The restaurant offers two varying menus; one for Japanese cuisine, another for Korean cuisine.
The food was good. I mainly wanted to eat from their Korean menu. 
The bibimbap was...ok, I've had better.
The bulgogi was delicious, I just wish they gave me a side of lettuce leaves with it.
As with any Korean restaurant, the usual side dishes are included. The sides were okay, I have had better tasting side dishes at other Korean restaurants. 
Overall a good place to eat if you're looking to try Korean food, and you're near the area.
Next time I'll be sure something different off of their menu."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Since I've been here a few times, I can give a pretty detailed review:

Ambiance: This place is pretty tiny, and usually there are not many people eating here. The few people who are here all seem to know each other. Don't let an empty restaurant dissuade you from eating here. This place is good, trust me!

Service: Always great! The only little issue I have is they gave me a raw egg to crack over my tofu soup (it cooks in the boiling soup) and they don't give me any moist towelettes or anything to clean my hands with. So I get raw egg salmonella germs on my hands, and then I have to keep eating my dinner with the dirty hands. 

Food: Excellent in both quality and quantity. I usually get the soft tofu soup (sondubu jigae) and it's always delicious. This place boasts being all natural, healthy, no MSG, etc, and I believe them because I never feel gross and bloated after eating there. The soup is well-flavored without tasting too salty like soups at most Korean places. The banchan are consistently good here. They are pretty good about refilling them even without you having to ask. I've also had the seafood pancake appetizer here, which is really great. I haven't tried the meat dishes, but usually at least one person I'm with will have the bulgogi, and they always like it."}
{"text":"This is great for those who are looking for a home cooked meal then resturant style type of food."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and it's alright, I guess it would be authentic, since the 2x I have been there its full of Koreans eating Korean food there.  I ordered the hot stone bibambop, that was okay and I have ordered the Tofu Soup, delicious, if you like soup!  Other than that it was alright nothing fancy and will definitely be coming back to get my Korean fix."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but I will no longer go here. I ordered $35 worth of food for lunch and received no banchan because it was sushi. They said it had to be korean dishes to qualify for banchan.  Wth.  Your operating a Korean/ Japanese restaurant an are try to sperate?  So what about the Korean roll with beef wrapped in seaweed and rice? Where does that fusion lye on your list?  
I'll stick with the other Korean or Japanese spots in Cleveland since they choose to break it down into a direct science. 
Sad cuz I really used to like them.  But quality got lost. That often happens."}
{"text":"So I'm continuing my hunt for good Korean food in Cleveland. This hole-in-the-wall place was actually a **4-STAR** in terms of FOOD. I had the soft tofu soup and the bibimbap. They were both delicious and would highly recommend them. The tofu soup was like the ones they serve in LA's K-town. Yummy!  It didn't have all these weird fresh vegetables like the way Seoul Garden serves it. Just the meat, soft tofu, broth and the fresh egg that gets dropped into the boiling hot spicy soup. The bibimbap was also very traditional - just the way I like it! Admittedly, the side dishes were decent but certainly not a match to the offerings at Seoul Garden. 

Why it got knocked down a star:

1)Location, location, location! I parked out in front and was told by the waiter that I should park in the back of the building so my car won't get broken into or my windows smashed. I'm from LA so I kinda get that...but holy poop! WTF, right? 

I don't know how to describe the building - it contains other businesses when you walk through the front door. If you keep walking in, that's where you find it. It reminded me of some areas of Monterey Park or Alhambra (those of you from LA will know what I'm talking about!) It's kind of set up like a food court - but not. 

2) Service - it's pretty mediocre. Like what others have said on yelp, the waiter largely ignores you after you order and brings your food out. 

That being said, if you're in it strictly for the food at decent prices - this is a good place to go... just remember to park in the back. 

If you're looking for good service and ambiance, move along folks!"}
{"text":"I think this is definitely a hidden gem. It's a tiny little place hidden in the back of the same building as superior pho. The outside is definitely a little sketch, but both of these restaurants offer authentic, well-priced, delicious foods.  In fact, it very reminscent of the various hole-in-the wall restaurants in Pusan and Seoul, and quite authentic. 

My boyfriend and I tried the hoe-dopbap, which is a selection of fish in a bed of rice. For the price, I was so surprised by the amount of fresh fish and roe that we got. It was this HUGE bowl of food that we shared. We both left well satisfied. 

They also give a cute small yogurt drink at the end of each meal. It's the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Wow. 
Soft Tofu Soup. 
Wow. 
If you like a little girth to your Korean soups - do it."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here a few days ago because Superior Pho was closed and Korea House was also closed. We split the seafood pancake, I got the soft tofu soup, and my friend got the bibimbap. 

Good amount of food, though pricey. The seafood pancake was an excellent choice -- the seafood was fresh enough and the texture was good. My tofu soup was a LOT of food, and that's coming from someone who was very hungry and eats a lot. It had vegetables and seafood, pretty spicy, and really good. The bibimbap I didn't eat, but it also looked really good. The food was pricey, but for once-in-a-while splurge it was definitely worth it. 

If I lived in Cleveland, I'd eat here every so often. I would definitely come back again, though! Worth trying if you're looking for some good Korean food (:"}
{"text":"Amazing is all I have to say, really good starters and everything was made to perfection in my opinion, the chigae was amaze and the kalbi was on point, japchae is to die for. Service is good and always attentive, price is also reasonable so hats off to the chef, definitely my new go to place for Saturday's"}
{"text":"This is my favourite K-food venue in CLE.  
That may or may not be an impressive statement, but it's got the warmth of home in a space that feels more like a cubby than a venue.

Simple decor, however, houses pragmatic service and the punch of a home-cooked meal."}
{"text":"A tiny hidden restaurant. I usually don't like it when restaurants try to fuse different Asian cuisines. This restaurant serves Japanese (sushi) and Korean BBQ. I was in Cleveland on business and was really craving Korean. 

I was pleasantly surprised! The Galbi was excellent! The banchan was also really good and fresh (included kimchi, seasoned bean sprouts, steamed egg, shredded squid, seasoned cucumber) HOWEVER I really missed the seasoned radish.  Not the best banchan  variety I've tried but definitely still really good! Food portions are medium  sized. 

The service was great and promt. Will definitely come back before I leave Cleveland."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've never reviewed Ha Ahn until now. This place quickly became my favorite Korean restaurant in the Cleveland area and my new go to place for Korean food.

First of all - their soondubu has healing powers. It's so good!!! Spicy, flavorful, with lots of seafood. Sometimes I order it with extra spiciness (and sometimes I suffer, but I always want more...) This is my go to dish here. 

Sometimes on the weekend, the older ladies are hand making the dumplings. SO GOOD.

The galbi (grilled beef) is really tender and excellent too. Highly recommend. Galbitang is another favorite.

Finally, the hoedeopbap (essentially sushi fish and rice) is excellent as well - great summer dish.

Service is attentive - they are good about filling up your banchan (small dishes - comes with steamed egg!) and always present a yakult (yogurt drink) to you when you're done.

FAV."}
{"text":"Very nice food, friendly staff. Lots Korean go to here, so it means something. They also give you little yogurt drinks at the end. So that was really nice. I got bulgugi, soft tofu soup and rice cake, all of them are nice."}
{"text":"The food here is...meh. It'll satisfy your Korean cravings, but there are definitely better Korean options in Cleveland (unless it's Monday, when both Miega and Korea House are closed). I ordered the tofu jiggae, which unfortunately wasn't hot enough, so my egg was pretty much raw the entire time. The sauce also didn't have enough spices/flavors to it. I had to add a lot of salt to make it somewhat tasteful :/ I tried a piece of my friend's galbi. So disappointed by it! It was slightly overcooked, so the meat was difficult to chew. The flavor was also not as sweet as I'm used to. We also shared the seafood pancake. This was actually pretty good! Perfect crispiness with a decent amount of seafood! 

I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Oh Korean food.  I have missed you so much since I left the Bay Area!  This place was so, so good!  So glad to find good Korean in Cleveland!  Went last night and had the hot and spicy pork dish.  First of all, portion was huge.  I ate half of my leftovers today for lunch and will probably finish the other half for lunch tomorrow.  The food was flavorful, the pork was tender and it was really reasonable.  I also liked almost all of the dishes they brought out prior to our meal.  Location makes it a little tricky to find (it's actually off of Superior on a little side street)."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with the friends. I love beef terayaki most! And the sushi tastes great!"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest to eat at all the asiatown restaurants. I live 50 miles away but sometimes my work takes me to Cleveland. 
This is a very small place across the hall from superior pho. They have pictures of the food on the wall which is usually a red flag. However the captions are in Korean. (I assume it's Korean)
I arrived at 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and only one other table was occupied. Also not promising.
 The waitress greeted me immediately and sat me down and served me tea. I ordered the pork bolgogi. It said spicy so that always draws my attention. 
The sides came first. Awesome. Kim Chee, potato, sprouts,broccoli rabe, shredded beef,radish. 
A few more customers wandered in. No one was speaking English. 
The bulgogi arrived. It was a mound of marinated shoulder on a sizzling platter with a couple of carrot coins and onion greens. An abundance of flavor.
The table next to me got a huge bib im bob and a short rib. It made me want to slide over and share. 
This place is definitely getting a second go."}
{"text":"I've really been digging on the Korean food scene lately, and I enjoyed a terrific meal here tonight. We were served 6 petite bowls of ban chan, and I thought all of them were very good; the bok choy and cucumber especially made me happy. The kimchi chigae was brilliant...I love the way this comes to the table, bubbling over with heat and super fragrant, with gorgeous cubes of silken tofu, plenty of onion and scallion, and bits of pork meat all afloat in a slightly sour and spicy broth. This dish could replace Vietnamese pho as my new fave comfort soup. We're big chicken eaters, and you don't often find many chicken dishes at Korean restaurants...this place has one, teriaki chicken, which was pretty yummy, more sweet than anything else, but delicious. We ate like royalty for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back.  Went for lunch and had the tidy soup, so good.  Great service.  Lunch menu is good, not like an Americanized typical Chinese lunch specials, their lunch menu sticks to authentic Korean."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with a friend for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food. 

My friend and I each got a bento box and split the kani-su appetizer.

We loved the kani-su (crab stick and avocado wrapped in cucumber and topped with a light citrus sauce). I'm pretty adventurous and my friend is not and we both enjoyed it. 

The bento boxes were delicious and fresh. I got the sushi bento box and my friend got the sushi/sashimi bento box. It included the entree, seaweed salad, California roll, two gyoza, house salad (with a ginger lime dressing) and some white rice. The tea is complimentary and they even provide you with a little cold dessert drink (not sure what it actually is, but it tastes like a smoothie) that's complimentary, too. 

I am looking forward to going back and trying the bibimbap as it looked delicious and authentic (make sure to get the hot stone bibimbap for the full experience!). 

The reason I rated four stars instead of five is because the service was actually quite slow. Unfortunately, not doable in under an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"Ambiance - decidedly below average.
Service - above average, as we were the only ones there, although Superior Pho across the hallway was crowded with every seat taken.
Chicken teriyaki with rice was stirfried and merely okay. 
This place is just not that great. Go to Superior Pho instead..."}
{"text":"I really liked it, as did my boyfriend. We started the meal with the green tea which was pleasantly warm. We ordered the seafood pancake appetizer which was stuffed with crab, squid, and shrimp. It was nice and crusty and the accompanying sauce was great. I ordered the sushi: Geisha roll and my boyfriend ordered a meat dish that I can't remember the name of. Miso soup and bachan came out first-- I loved the soup and my boyfriend enjoyed the bachan. The food was also really good and more well done than other pan-asian restaurants in Cle. 

If you live on the west side, this is a good close option particularly if you are used to other restaurants like Tree Country."}
{"text":"Always dine in here,but when I had my second time take-out, I feel disappointed. The lunch seafood tofu soup only have a half Quart size which cost $9. Last time I got the dinner size tofu soup which only 3/4 Quart size. This is overpriced,won't recommend their take-out."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place changed hands but I have to say that the food and service got way better. I've dined and taken carry out two separate occasions and both were superb. The place seemed that it got renovated too so it looks much nicer than before. 

The first time I went back was Friday afternoon and I was greeted immediately by a nice gentleman that served me. I ordered their Nambi udon soup with their eel and salmon nigiri. The soup was flavorful and it was what I needed on a rainy and gloomy day. The eel was fresh and it offered a nice side dish to the soup. The second time I had ordered out their Teuk Mandu Soup and the Rock and roll sushi. The soup again was so good that I finished it in one sitting and I couldn't leave any leftovers. The 4 dumplings were large and were filled with cabbage, noodles, and some pork. The rice cakes it came were also nice and chewy. The banchan (about 5 sides) also were delicious. The roll which I saved for later was also tasty and it works well together with the kimchi. 

I didn't see anything on their menu about BBQ but I have to say this has become my favorite go to Korean place than Seoul Garden. The prices are much more affordable and i would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday at Ha Ahn's and could not have been more pleased. A small place, the restaurant was packed!  Yukgaijan (Spicy Shredded Beef Soup) was some of the best I've had.  My nephew had the Bibimbap and not only was it good...but he got a healthy portion!  I would also like to compliment them on their Banchan (Side Dishes) as they were excellent...and whoever is making the Kimchi...!"}
{"text":"Came into this little strip mall today planning on going to Superior Pho, but little did we relaize they weren't open on Monday :o(  Ha Ahn stepped in to save the day, what an amazing little Korean place.  I got the bibimbap lunch special and my awesome fellow yelper got the Kimchi chigae while we split some dumplings.  Both of them were excellent dishes, however, with the colder weather fast approaching, I may be tempted to come back and order that Kimchi chigae for a nice comfort food.

Solid waitress, fast service and great Kimchi!  What more could you ask for in a Korean restaurant?  The only reason for one less star is because I think it's going to be a little difficult for me to find on my own without a native Clevelander doing the driving, and I dearly want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This was my first real experience with Korean food. I'll have to agree with fellow yelper Dee A. in that this wasn't my favorite overall as far as a type of Asian cuisine. But it was very good. I just think that this is the kind of place that I would want to carefully choose my menu selections. I suspect that I would be wayyy more into Korean BBQ, in which this place is not.

For an appetizer, we got the spicy rice cake and seafood pancake. I really liked the pancake. It was a bit thick and greasy, but really tasty. It was great with the salty soy sauce based dipping sauce. The \"rice cake\" was oddly good. The red sauce was tasty and although the consistency of the (glutenous) sliced rice \"rod\" was strange, it was good. I did make the mistake however, of eating the large slab of (what I found out was) fish cake at the bottom. Out of the two, I think I would definitely order the pancake again.

For my entree, I ordered the Pork Bulgogi. Excellent. You really can't go wrong with marinated pork. Nice and spicy and it was mostly all meat. And A LOT of it! Just a few veggies. I liked the sticky rice that accompanied this as well. I would definitely order this again. It was YUMMY.

There was 6 little sides of various pickled things. Some I liked, some I didn't. I could do without the fish cake and dried fish. It was a little too pungent for me. I liked the kimchi, turnip, pickle and bean sprouts though.

I would definitely like to try this place again."}
{"text":"Galbi. Galbi-tang. Soft-tofu soup. Cold Noodles. Hot-stone bibimbap. Spicy Crunch roll. Kani Su. Those are my favorites.

Ha-Ahn is a cute little hole-in-the-wall place with truly authentic Korean food. I have made it a ritual to get multiple meals in at Ha Ahn every time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is like a little Korean sit-down well hidden, smack in the middle of Cleveland.  From the smells, decor, to the majority of Asian patronage, while sitting here you can almost forget you are in a mid-west town.  

The food at Ha Ahn is simply put  (delicious with a true Korean flare).  Don't expect to find this place easily and don't expect to find linen service or fancy ambiance here.  You will however find a guaranteed experience to an as authentic Korean as FDA would permit.  The condiments of spicy dried fish, kimchee, pickled potato, to spicy fish cakes served with any of the bubbly piping hot brothy dishes, are a mouth watering Korean experience.  The background noise of loud Korean conversations keep you pleasantly oblivious to what might be a disturbance in other english speaking patronage.  

The ambiance is devoid of decor with simple chairs and tables,  the only cutlery to be found is a soup spoon in a paper wrapper and chopsticks.  The simplistic interior that is filled with korean spice drifting from the kitchen (this will linger on your jacket for couple days unless washed) and the patronage create its own kind unique of cultural & gastronomic experience.

One advice,  if this is your first time with Korean,  be mindful of the intense taste,  ultimately true Korean in an acquired taste.  If you like Korean,  don't leave town without eating at Ha Ahn.  You will regret it otherwise.  

One tip about finding this place - if you follow google map you will end up in front a nail salon no sign for Ha Ahn on Superior.  Enter the main entrance and you will find a small area of multiple stores, walk to the back or follow the smell.  :-)"}
{"text":"Best Korean in Cleveland. Quaint atmosphere and service with a smile. Go for the Bibimbap, it's delicious."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are obsessed with this place! Their sushi is amazing and fresh. The staff is really friendly and very helpful with suggestions. The portions are huge! It can be a little pricy for lunch but it's completely worth it. It can be hard to find if you aren't familiar with the area as there are 2 other Asian restaurants in the same building and no defining signage outside. There is a parking lot in the back, though, which is great for downtown. We have tried a selection of sushi rolls all very good. The sushi bento boxes are a huge portion with a very nice variety of food. I also tried the beef bulgogi which was very similar to a steak fajita with strips of meat onions and peppers. I ordered it without rice which they seemed confused by. Lastly, one of my favorites is their soup on a could day and it was great. Again a huge portion. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is descent but not the best korean food I have eaten. There is only one person serving all the people so the wait can get a hungry you impatient. The place isnt big so you might have to wait when you go at 5-7pm. The price is fair(about $14/person) and the potion of the dishes are nice, considering the fact that I can eat a lot. Its really nice of them to give you different appetizers and a Korean yogurt drink for free."}
{"text":"As much as we've always liked Ha Ahn, on our most recent visit last week, it seems they may have priced themselves out of a possible return. Prices have taken a steep spike -- $11 for six dumplings? $14 for meatless Jap Chae and then $4 for an ounce or two of steak? We were quite surprised how expensive they've gotten. Service was also an issue, as their lone non-Korean server struggled to keep up in every way possible. (As an example, he actually took our water glasses away and \"kept\" them for a good 6-7 minutes before we reminded him we still had no water... not a great practice when customers are eating very spicy food.)"}
{"text":"Yes! Will go there, and travel out of my way to go there.

Sundubu Jigae (tofu seafood soup) was spicy as requested, with a flavorful broth and decent size pieces of squid, shrimp, clam. Ate every drop and scraped the bowl. Half dozen banchan: two kim chi, two cold fried things, mung sprouts, and an egg. 

Sashimi in very good size portions. 

Quick service, and Yaklut at the end.

In Cleveland's AsiaTown district, so there are multiple groceries, restaurants, and other stores nearby.

The women's room is run down and not particularly clean."}
{"text":"Cute little Korean restaurant. Parking can be a pain, but it's worth it. It's not as good as Seoul Garden, but gets bonus points for being a quick and a nice environment. It feels very clean, but still friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The place is very small so there was a bit of a wait but the food came out at a reasonable time. 
We got the seafood pancakes, fish egg soup, and the kalbi. All were excellent. I wish the soup had a deeper, better developed flavor which is why I have to give it 4 stars. The pancake was perfectly fried."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think that Korean food is like a style of clothing that will just never fit me right--like bell-bottoms and tennis shoes. (I'm serious... I sort of look like a mutant in sneakers)

Regardless, what I'm trying to say is Korean is not my favorite Asian cuisine. I just don't jive very well with dried fish, tentacles and fish cakes. I'll eat seafood, but concentrated fishiness does not need to be a part of my life. 

With that being said, Ha Ahn serves up super-authentic and fresh Korean fare. Even though I don't prefer this style of food, there were things I thoroughly enjoyed--like the mammoth sized bowl of spicy beef and vegetable soup I ordered. Red, hot, rich broth with strips of beef, bean sprouts and other veggies. I added a little more hot sauce and it there you have it, the perfect answer to a cold, rainy night. The kimchee was deliciously spicy and those little pickles were quickly hoarded by me, of course. 

Some things I didn't like? The seafood pancake. Again, this wasn't because it was actually \"bad\", but merely because I can't bring myself to consume tentacles--and this huge pancake had loads of 'em. Couldn't handle it. I kept my distance from the dried fish and fish cakes, especially after seeing my fellow diner's facial expression when she ate one. I'll just take her word for it. 

True to authentic Korean style, we were given these sweet, little yogurt shots after our meals that were a huge hit. I don't typically like sweet, but these were tangy, ice cold and refreshing. The perfect end to a spicy meal. 

One word of advice is to not be weirded out when you seriously can't frickin' find this place. Oh yea, it's one of those \"hidden in the depths\" \"get you in pissed at your significant other 'cause you can't find the damn place and you've turned around six times\" kind of spot. When you feel like you're walking into a soul food shop, you've come to the right place. Just keep walking back until you see a tiny restaurant with green lights."}
{"text":"My first Korean food experience in Cleveland. 

Spartan surroundings and a narrow seating area belie great food.  

You're greeted with hot tea although there is no sweetener in sight. 

Ordered the steamed dumpling appetizer and the beef bulgogi. It was a LOT of food. 

Dumplings were interesting but the filling was a bit bland. There were eight though, and they were large. 

The banchan accompaniments were fun and tasty. 

The beef bulgogi was ok but the beef was a lttle on the tough side and the overall flavor was sweet without much else going on.

The service was good (I was the only person there) but overall for $20 the meal could have been better. 

I plan on going back soon and having the pork bulgogi.  It's listed as \"spicy\" so we'll see!

{"text":"I come here for Bibimbap, husband comes here for sushi and kids get our miso. It's a win-win-win. We will always be Ha Ahn regulars because the Korean food and the sushi is some of the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good Bibimbap served along with six deferent kimchis. Lunch was served with a nice unusual tea, when I asked about the tea the server had no clue about the tea or anything else I asked about. All the food coming out the kitchen looked amazing. There are large pictures of all the food lining the walls so if you are not familiar with Korean food this will help you. Food comes out of the kitchen one item at a time. Can't wait to go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"The price is a little bit high, but food is good and the sides are refiiled quickly."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good here. Ordered the Spicy pork bulgoki and Kalbi dishes for lunch, both came out quickly and were delicious. I wish there was more pork in my dish though, the balance between meat and veggies was a little off.

Also got the shrimp shumai appetizer, which was nice, light, and tasty! The service was great, especially with only one person serving at that time. I'm glad I tried this place out!!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place.  It was a nice find - easy to park on a weeknight before I went to night classes.  It proved more than I expected.  A very, small, humble space.  Modest sized menu.  Well prepared food with huge portions.  The bim bam bop in stone pot is awesome beyond words.  If you are truly adventurous, try the soups - especially the kimchi soup.  Very spicy, and they are served to you as a bubbling cauldron!  Friendly service.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews. Would not return. The building that the tiny restaurant is located in is absolutely filthy and gross. The restroom was a scene out of Escape from New York. The server looked like he just rolled out of bed; hair sticking up, shirt disheveled and worst of all he literally had a booger dangling out a nostril. It made it hard to look at him or eat the food. When he brought my tea his hands were all over the rim of the cup..,COME ON! That is serving 101. The bebimbob (sp?) was not very good. A pile of iceberg lettuce and the egg was cooked hard and dry. I can't vouch for the sushi but I highly recommend Korea House for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"yum! you know you're having a great dining experience when you're already looking forward to coming back and you haven't even left yet. i'm excited to share this place with friends who have never been. I've been meaning to check it out for a long time, but am usually swayed by superior pho which is a long time favorite. Now that's i've finally made may way into Ha Ahn, I already know that I will be back many times. Looking forward to trying pretty much everything on the menu. It was difficult making up my mind on what to order. The steamed dumplings were delicious. My partner and I split and order... but I see why they are listed as an entree because you really just want to keep eating more. I think either of us would have happily devoured the entire order as our meal. The Kani-su was refreshing and delightful. We enjoyed the banchan. He got the udon and i got the kimchi soup. Both delicious. i had to take most of mine home because I was too full. A pleasant surprise was the complimentary yogurt desert drink. I will be back sooner than later and especially looking forward to coming in for lunch, as well as trying out the sushi."}
{"text":"Crow, yes I am eating some crow. This place was F#$%ing off the charts good. It was like they read my last review and wanted to improve, you have come along way baby
, I should praise you like I  should.
1st the service was fanastic. One super server there was, and a sushi chef. I was imedeately brought out tea. My order was taken promptly,  complimentary miso soup and  a mother load of banchan arrived. The steamed egg was fantastic. be careful as you could scald your mouth it was that hot and fresh. 

My beef and squid came out a short time later, it was surf and turf perfection. served on a sizzling platter, with that slightly sweet, salty, and spicy mix of flavors bursting in my mouth like a wonderful symphony.  

Oh how sorry I am for walking out on you more than three years ago, I should have given you a second chance. Thank you for taking me back. I see no reason to see anyone else but you."}
{"text":"We came for the sushi even though this is mostly a Korean restaurant it seemed like. The location is off the beaten path and in a little building next to Superior Pho. We started with a Philadelphia roll and yellowtail nigiri to see how fresh it was so we would know if we wanted to continue with sushi or switch to Korean. We were pleasantly surprised with the freshness of the fish and decided to trek onward with the raw. After that we ordered the pink lady roll and the yum yum roll. They were both pretty good but i kinda hoped for more raw fish instead of a mixed cooked fish in the middle of some sushi paper but that was probably ordering error. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Very good Korean food.  Small, quaint restaurant... no more than 10 tables. Service was one older lady that was very, very nice, fast, and attentive. I have now tried all of the Korean restaurants in the Cleveland area and feel that this ranks second to Seoul Garden.

Banchan wasn't great. Just a mere 6 little dishes.

What we ordered:
- Seafood pancake - Amazing. First time I've had it anywhere, and I'm a fan. Eat it fast because it will get a little tough and lose some flavor if it cools down.
- Dolsot Bibimbap - Pretty good. Egg comes prefried with the yolk still runny, just the way I like it.
- Galbi (short rib) - Also good. Not off the bone. Tasted like it was soaked in soy sauce a little bit too long.
- Dukboki (spicy rice cake) - This one was a little disappointing. The rice cakes were really thick. The sauce was ok, not great, and not as good as the one at Seoul Garden.

The meal ended with a complimentary \"yakult\" which is a sweet Asian yogurt-y drink. Very good and takes any Asian back to their childhood.

Overall, I enjoyed it and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in all of Cleveland. We absolutely love coming here with friends -- the food is delicious and VERY authentic Korean (I take my Korean friend here every time he visits and he says it's like eating his mother's home cooking). Pretty decent sushi, too, but I recommend ordering something different every time. It's always a hit!"}
{"text":"Out of all the genres of Asian food Korean is probably my least favorite.  That doesn't mean it's bad, it just wouldn't be my first choice.  However, one of my absolutely favorite meals was when I was in South Korea.  It was one of only a few meals I really enjoyed over there and I was craving something similar to it the other night.  I really wanted Korean BBQ with tons of different condiments and the beef sizzling in front of me.  
Since the restaurant was close to closing, I opted for takeout instead.  I got the beef bulgogi and the spicy pancake.  For the spicy pancake I was hoping for something similar to a Vietnamese crepe or Chinese pancake but I got something completely different.  I think they need to re-name this dish because there was no pancake.  It was a bunch of really dense balls of dough (like super intense gnocci and a few strips of what looked like scrambled egg with an over powering red sauce.  I ate two of the dough balls and couldn't eat anymore.  I was actually starting to become nauseous by the smell.  This may have been my fault but then I googled Korean spicy pancake and saw plenty of pictures of what I thought it was going to be so maybe they gave me the wrong product or something.  I threw the rest of the huge dish out.
The beef bulgogi was just ok.  The meat was a little tough but the sauce was good.  There was just nothing standing out.  Also, they only give you three little side dishes.  The kim-chi was decent (definitely not homemade) but I found the noodles and spinach to be a bit bitter.  
Overall, it was disappointing.  The third star though is for the incredibly nice workers and for being accomodating even though they were close to closing.  I may try dining in but it's probably going to be a while before I crave Korean again."}
{"text":"I give this place a grand seal of approval. I was disparate for good Korean. Not good Asian, but KOREAN food one Monday night. It was close to 10pm and most places were either closed or almost closed when we decide to give this place a try. Admittedly it wasn't easy to find. A hole in the wall it was, and the surrounding area looked all industrial and grim at the time of night. Even as we were sat and given menus, I almost walked out and I'm almost ashamed! Once we made out orders, the food came out very fast, and my moaning began..

Their side dishes were impressive, bulgogi beef was exceptional! I think if they opened in Sydney they'd do very, very well. Waitstaff looked a bit rough but service was good, and their Korean yoghurt was unexpected and cute, I thought. 

The appetisers we had included agedashi tofu and crab roll wrapped in cucumber, and they were all clean and tasty, although I think the highlight was definitely bulgogi beef- recommended!! 

It was a beautiful night although it was hard to breathe afterwards..."}
{"text":"Omg delicious is what's coming out of my mouth about this place... Very small place but quaint!!!  Very traditional Korean style & good... I felt like I was back in my homeland (Seoul). Everyone should try it!!  Delicious side dishes (banchan), I had the Al-Chigae (Roe stew) delish!!  See attached pictures.... Service was great (poor waiter was all nervous but sweet)   Can't wait to return when i return to Cleveland.  Who knew Cleveland has one of the best Korean Restraunts in the Midwest!!! BON APPETITE!!!"}
{"text":"Someone explain to me why I don't come here more often. Do I forget it's there because of it's location or what? That's just ridiculous, this place has a parking lot in the back! Don't be like me, remember this little gem exists because the food here is great!

My go-to at most Korean restaurants is sundubu jiggae (tofu stew) with seafood. This place does it really well. It's spicy but so worth it and they don't skimp out on the seafood. This time around I felt the need to reward myself with a job well done so I went with their pork bulgogi. I was in the mood for kbbq but, as I was by myself, going to a place to grill it was out. I'm always sort of hesitant to get already prepared bulgogi and galbi as I prefer to grill it myself at restaurants but I will say this did not disappoint. It was tender and had the great bulgogi taste with a bit of a kick to it from the added spicy sauce.

The banchan (side dishes) was lovely as always with a nice variety of spicy, savory and fresh tastes as well as a steamed egg. Another thing I love about Korean restaurants in general, Ha Ahn included, you can always get more rice or banchan free of charge! The prices of the dishes themselves are pretty comparable to other Korean places in the area.

This place is pretty tiny but they still somehow fit a surprising number of tables in, without making you feel claustrophobic. The service was pleasant but, like other Korean places, it's not super hands on which I prefer. 

Overall, love this place and I really do need to remember it exists."}
{"text":"This might be the best restaurant in Cleveland.  It deserves six stars.  I have been to dozens of Korean places in Seoul, Manhattan, and L.A....and Ha Ahn was more delicious, fresh, and authentic.

The ingredients seemed to be of the highest quality.  The setting is  definitely very modest, but that is what I like about it.  A hidden gem, but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I got galbi tang and the size was small. The bowl is as big as ping pong ball while usually it should be as big as baseball (you get the idea). Inside the small bowl, there are 3 huge bones but not so much beef....It is quite pricy for what you get at 12 bucks! The taste was good but I prefer some cabbage in the soup. I would give it 4 star if the portion is bigger or the price is at 10 bucks."}
{"text":"The Side dishes here were the best I've had at a korean restaurant, but usually I hate them so that isn't saying a whole lot. That said, it really got me looking forward to the entre, which I usually love Korean food sans the cold veggies, but alas, it was a little bit below average. Oh well, an alright spot and good prices.  And BYOB ain't bad either."}
{"text":"I've been on a soup kick lately since it has been a very bitter-cold winter here in Cleveland.  My go to spot for Kimchi Jigae is Miega, but unfortunately they are not open on Mondays.  Thank you Ha Ahn for being open! I needed that Kimchi Jigae.  It tasted just like my Mom's simple and flavorful-tofu, pork, kimchi, onions and a spicy rich broth with a hint of sour.  I ordered it to go, and was pleasantly surprised that they included the banchan that you usually get when you dine in!  No Korean meal is complete without banchan =)  As I picked up my order I noticed other diners there and it was nice to hear the familiar Korean language.  You know a Korean restaurant is legit when other Korean diners choose to go there."}
{"text":"This was my first time exploring in our \"Asiatown\" and I am thoroughly satisfied! 
My friend had been a few times and recommended we go there for lunch! What a great idea that was! It's quite hidden from the main road which helps me to understand why i've never come across it before... you have to park in the little lot on E31st (south of superior) and the entrance is in the back. 
My friend recommended the bibimbap and i am so happy she did! It came out nice and hot! (sizzling!!)  and was absolutely delicious! 
She tried the chicken teriyaki, also amazing! 
When they brought us our check, we also got two little yogurt sweet drinks. its was a yummy little sweet ending to a huge! and delicious meal! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"\"Yay! I'm a fan.\" Means if you're in Cleveland and you want Korean food, then this is the PLACE TO GO! Service is a little slow, there's basically one waitress who runs back and forth doing everything, and I think there's only one stove back there with one grill. But the food is worth the wait. This place is definitely comparable to California, and I eat from both north to south and central California, so I know good food.

The stone pot bimimbap is better than the one I had at Tree Country on Coventry, and it's definitely comparable to the one's I've had in San Francisco, CA. The pot was nice and hot, where i was able to mix everything up and had the rice all crunch after awhile. There was a lot of meat and veggies. Huge portion! Also ordered the LA Kalbi and it was marinated like no other! Really good, and definitely just like the marinades you find in California. I was disappointed in the steamed dumplings, but then again I never order steamed dumplings at a Korean restaurant, but we didn't like it. We really wanted the Korean Fried Chicken Wings, which are AMAZING in New York (heard of Kyochon?), but unfortunately they ran out of chicken wings! Sad! The side dishes were good, but lacking your usual kimchi, spinach, broccoli, anchovies, sweet potato and peppers. I would have loved tofu and fish cakes. Next time I want to have the cold noodles, love those at korean restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5 star Korean restaurant in L.A but I was surprised to taste the authenticity in Cleveland so I'm giving an additional 0.5 stars. This place was hard to find and the owners didn't speak too much english but I enjoyed their bibimbab dish. 

I wasn't able to try too much stuff from the menu but I can confirm other yelper's claim that this place is authentic."}
{"text":"Food was meh, the service was pretty bad. We kept having to ask for water because the waitress was sitting at her counter painting her toe nails which was pretty disgusting but that wasnt the worst part. After awhile a cockroach came up to me and said hi and I felt like throwing up after that. Food was C- Service was D, environment was F."}
{"text":"This place is not for your meatatarian friends.

Don't get me wrong - the portion sizes are great.  However, every dish that is supposed to have meat has scant helpings of it.  The bi bim bop has maybe a spoonful of ground beef, so that when it is mixed into the rice, it does not amount to anything at all.  The galbi tang has four small chunks of galbi.  The jap chae, we noticed, is totally vegetarian.  And apparently you don't get much meat when you order barbeque as well.

Putting the lack of meat aside, the taste of the food has mostly hits and a few misses - maybe a four overall.  The seafood pancake tastes wonderful.  The pancake itself is constructed well - neither too doughy nor falling apart - and it has a good mix of seafood and veggies.  The stone pot bi bim bop is at the perfect temperature such that the stone crisps up the rice but does not burn it.  On the flip side, the galbi tang tastes like... hot water with a lot of pepper in it.

Anyways, if you're not a big fan of meat, you'll probably like this place.  Carnivores, steer clear."}
{"text":"Oh, bibimbop. I love you. 

Ha Ahn Korean is little more than a glorified hallway next to Superior Pho, but it is quite nice. The food was excellent. My bibimbop came out sizzling in a cast iron bowl, with the runny egg and hot sauce just right. My friend's beef bulogi looked excellent, and the starter dishes were small but flavorful. The palate-cleansing yogurt drink at the end was also a very nice touch. For hot tea and a decent bowl of bibimbop, my tab came under $10. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Continues to be excellent. The banchan is always fresh and varied. The stone bowl bibimbap was great. The hoedupbap-the Korean chirashi sushi -is amazing. The sushi which I finally started to eat is well prepared and fresh. The steamed mandoo (dumplings) are particularly good. Authentic. Fresh. Hand made."}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean food joint I've found (so far) in Cleveland. The place is hardly ever packed, and it has ample seating for the crowd that it seems to get.

First, the food: It's good. Probably as authentic Korean food as you'll get to encounter in the greater Cleveland area. The menu offers a variety of options, though if you (or anyone in your group) are vegan or vegetarian, you won't have a lot to choose from. The banchan (appetizers/side-dishes) are decent, though nothing extraordinary. The prices are a bit steep, enough to make it a once-in-a-while treat for me. But the portions are generous enough to make you feel that your wallet's been unfairly violated. In fact, I don't think I've ever ordered one of their jjigae (stew/casserole) or meat dishes and walked out of there without to-go boxes full of leftover (in addition to a full stomach). I suspect they may try to adjust the taste (esp. with the spiciness and the strong flavours in some of the dishes) for guests who aren't visibly Korean, but I don't know for sure. Their lunch specials are phenomenal (11 a.m. to 3 p.m., I believe).

Second, the service: It's pretty efficient, quick, and nice. While your average family-restaurant kind of service isn't to be expected, I believe the staff here will try their best to accommodate your needs and requests. Expect to use simple English.

N.B.: The way things are done here resembles your typical Korean restaurant, which means, among other things, you should feel absolutely free to call for the staff's attention if you want it. It's not considered rude; don't wait for someone to accidentally look your way. You may think your server is being rude and inattentive, but they're really not.

Third, the location: The configuration is a bit bizarre, to say the least. It's actually the one aspect of this place that I can't seem to get used to. It's a small cut in the hallway in a building that doesn't appear to house a decent Korean restaurant... Either that, or someone decided to open a business -in- the building's hallway. At any rate, if you're questioning whether you're in the right building as you walk in, you are. There is a limited number of street parking on Superior and on E 31st."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service, we fully enjoyed the two non-Korean servers working there. Lol The Korean man (not sure but he could be the owner...?) rolled my cucumber pretty well and it was refreshing and delicious. Their rice cake dumpling soup was great too. Wish I could've tried more dishes but I left stuffed and feeling happy."}
{"text":"Ha Ahn is a small, cozy restaurant that is hidden near the New Number One restaurant.  The staff was accommodating, although service was a little slow during peak dinner hours.  The menu is very compact and in Korean and English - photos of the items can also be seen on the inside and the outside of the restaurant.

Our table ordered the steamed dumplings and seafood pancake appetizers, along with the bibimbap, beef bulgogi, beef teriyaki, and several of the soups.  The appetizers were average.  The entree portions were generous, although I thought that the bibimbap should have had more meat and vegetables to go with the rice.  I also observed that the beef bulgogi and beef teriyaki were very similar, with the only noticeable difference being that the beef teriyaki had a sweeter sauce.

Overall though, this is a good place for a good variety of tasty food. The seafood dishes looked very appealing and are something that I would try the next time."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?  So, they're a little short on staff but they're really nice and it feels like a family run restaurant.  It's small and so what that if they have pictures of the food on the wall.  Someone else said it was expensive.  Our check was $20 including tax.  I couldn't have eaten another bite.  

We've eaten at less than a dozen Korean restaurants so I am not an expert but I had a great meal here tonight.  The Banchan was just fine.  I really liked the bok choy a lot and the rest were good too.  We asked for extra bok choy and we got it without any question.  6 dishes was plenty.  

We shared the chicken teryiaki and the kimchi jige.  The chicken teryiaki was delicious, you have to like a little sweet.  It comes out on a hot plate and is smoking hot for the whole meal.  The kimchi is just boiling hot and similarly is in a hot pot.  This dish is hot and sour and was one of the most wonderful Asian dishes I have had in recent memory.  It had plenty of pork, tofu, onions and cabbage.  

They give you a nice yogurt drink with your check.  I can't wait to go back.  We had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"This place is often overlooked for the more popular superior pho but this is a mistake. It is very good. I suggest the pork and squid entrée if you like spicy food. In my opinion the sushi is some of the best in town and not in a uptight environment, it is relaxed and very delicious. Also the white tuna nigiri is the best I've had in some time and quite affordable."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Ha Ahn. What a pleasant surprise. The staff explained everything that I ordered. The bibimbap was superb. I will order it again just for the appetizers that come with it. Yelp is telling me to add more words to my review. OK. I ate everything I ordered and will come back to do it again."}
{"text":"I ended up having the Pork bulgogi. It was pretty spicy. Not very spicy, but spicy enough. I asked for it extra spicy and was essentially told no.

Some corrections to reviews that I have seen in other reviews. There were plenty of koreans (actually only Koreans) here when I came. The people are super nice here. The kimchi was actually pretty darn good. Only sad part was they didn't have the thin noodles in the bon chon. Also, there were probably 7 or 8 bon chon plates served...not sure why some people got 3.

There was a good variety of things ordered by others. I waffled between the bulgogi and the soon tofu. But I was getting pho next door afterward so I went with the pork.

I would definitely come back to try the tofu soup. They didn't have any combo platters, unfortunately. Though the place was pretty cheap for korean food. The tofu soup comes in most of the varietals. 

Nom nom"}
{"text":"Good authentic Korean food. A smaller restaurant, more homey feel. I've had the lunch bento box with bulgogi, sundubu, yukgaejang, and hot stone bibimbap. Comes with the little Korean side dishes (kimchi, various vegetables, steamed egg, etc). Bathrooms are kinda sketchy"}
{"text":"Tofu soup is great. Side dishes are fresh and delicious. Service is always prompt and courteous. Chap jae is also a favorite."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few co workers on a Friday. While it was difficult to find, this place is definitely a hidden gem! Tucked away in what is pretty much a wide hallway, we were quickly greeted by our server, sat and our drink order was taken. I've never been a big Korean food guy but our server walked me through the menu and recommended a few things. Eventually ordered and our food came out quickly! It was DELICIOUS! I had a monsoon sushi roll and a philly hand roll. The bento boxes are giant too and super cheap. At the end of the day, the service, food and overall experience was outstanding. Will be making many trips back."}
{"text":"Overpriced Korean food.

My friend had the biggest craving for Korean food. As we searched yelp, we decided to go to Ha Ahn tonight, as we had seen it previously on our recent trip to Superior Pho.

We arrived around 8pm...and it was pretty empty. We decided to go with galbi and some beef bulgogi. As they ranged from prices of 11-15 bucks, I was expecting a pretty good sized dish, maybe sizzling, you know, the works.

I was saddened by first, only 4 side dishes. They weren't that great either- the kimchi was definitely... not fresh. Then our dishes came out. For 15 bucks, you get 3 sad looking pieces of galbi. And then, since it's the actual slab of ribs, they hand you some cheap scissors to cut it. Overpriced for so little. Don't get me wrong. The marinade was great on the galbi. But really? The meat wasn't that tender.... not so great.

The bulgogi... was also.. meh. It wasn't so flavorful, and yes, again, it came out on this small plate with lots of onions. I mean, it was good...but portions were small and it could have been so much better.

Overall...not that great for Korean food. I guess if you have a really huge craving, then..sure...but nah, not that great."}
{"text":"This place is ok. We ordered soft tofu soup, galbi, and stir-fry squid and pork. The squid and pork dish had a weird smell/taste to it - i was not sure if the food was actually fresh or something. But after I had some other spicy food, the taste mostly went away, but I would much rather have it without that weird taste. I think it's the pork that tasted weird mostly. The galbi was not bad, but I think they over cooked it - it was kinda burned and it was a little too tough. The soft tofu soup was probably the best among all three, although it was a little bland. I dunno, just seems that something is missing. The service was great tho - the waiter was very nice and I appreciated the asian yogurt drink thingy after a meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork bulgogi, which was a great choice. The meat was very tender and the dish was sweet and spicy. Lots of flavor. Presentation was great! The dish came out on a wooden platter and was steaming and smelled delicious.

I personally didn't try the sushi, but was told it was okay! Not mind-blowing but not bad. Pretty average.

The only negative remark I have is that the waitress may have been trying to be sarcastic funny? A member of our party ordered a sushi roll and asked to substitute the avocado for carrots and the waitress made a face and said \"....no?\" Was not sure if this was meant to be funny, but also did not receive the substitute carrots."}
{"text":"Two stars for the delicious lunch bento box, but otherwise on my \"Never Again\" list. I am pretty easygoing and only notice \"bad\" service if it's like reeeaaalllly ridiculous. 

Our waiter at Ha Ahn was really ridiculous. I noticed.

A friend and I took my Mom to lunch here and we were blown away at now rude and awful the waiter was. Suffice to say, he succeeded in making us feel incredibly unwelcome. My mom was so upset.... She almost never eats out in restaurants, but usually feels comfortable in Korean establishments. She took his blatant rudeness personally, which really sucked. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior of this restaurant keep you away from trying it! I would recommend this place to everyone I know in the town.

There were lots of complimentary appetizers, including a pot of steamed egg. Tried the seafood pancake, which was recommended by most Yelpers here. It was stuffed with lots of seafood, and it was softer than I expected, but it still was a good dish. The beef bulgogi is ok. What really amazed me was the spicy tofu soup. It tasted so good that I could finish the whole meal by myself. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Nice little Jem.  Ordered Sushi to go.  Everyday Morning and Geisha was great.  Would come back for the sushi."}
{"text":"Ha Ahn is a very cute Korean restaurant located adjacent to Superior Pho. The menu has both Japanese and Korean dishes. I wanted to try some of the sushi however I did not indulge. My friend and I ordered the bibimbap and bulgogi. Out of the 2 dishes, I preferred the bulgogi. We decided to defy the Yelpers recommendations of staying away from bulgogi and are glad we did. The meat was plentiful with good seasoning. The trio of staff members were all very friendly. As we walked out of the building I noticed that there were a lot of people in Superior Pho. I wish that some of the business would migrate down the hall. It is worth it. Support your local businesses. Keep the money and economy flowing."}
{"text":"A hard to find hole in the wall (almost literally).  Given the run-down appearance of the building that houses this restaurant, I didn't expect too much.  At first sight, one might also worry about the cleanliness of the place.  But, it's a family-run business with surprisingly attentive service and unexpectedly good Korean food.  From kalbi, bulgogi to soondooboo and yukejang, they have all the standard Korean dishes.  As in any korean restaurant, your food is served with an assortment of complimentary pan chan (little appetizer dishes).  

I went once for lunch with a group of 4 friends who were equally surprised at the quality of food.  We also got a complimentary summer sushi roll (crab, avocado, and egg wrapped in a thin layer of cucumber) drizzled with a sweet and savory sauce.  The service was a little too good that day - the waiter kept filling our water and asking if we needed anything else - it got a tad weird."}
{"text":"I come here often for the Bibimbap. It's the best in Cleveland and it's so addicting, I find myself sitting at Ha Ahn's by myself slamming the whole bowl, along with all those tiny tasty plates of food that come with it. Then to top it off, you get a tiny bottle of strawberry yogurt for free at the end of the meal. All of it is unusually satisfying...."}
{"text":"I ate here because I stumbled on it and was craving Korean. It's a tiny restaurant, but that was the appealing part about it. I really liked it. Besides an old Korean woman the only customer was myself. They were very courteous. And the food was great."}
{"text":"We usually go to Seoul Garden, but it is closed today, so we give Ha Ahn a try, and I love this little restaurant!! The hot stone Bibimbap and the soft tofu soup are soooo good, and the pork bulgogi is juicy and tender. Side dishes are very tasty, and the staff is friendly. I will recommend it."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than I do.  I want to give them a better rating. I want to say that I might go back.  But unless all the other Korean food establishments in the area close, it's unlikely.

The food was meh. Just another tiny Korean restaurant trying to get by, trying to get more business by \"diversifying\" the menu and adding sushi. Trying to be Japanese-Korean blend... but really, reinforcing my belief that pan-asian restaurants exist because you really aren't that great at any single component.

Service was friendly, polite, prompt. But there's just no reason to go back there.
-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience here, I wanted to like it so much. I have walked by it a few times en route to Superior Pho, this was finally my time passing SP and dining in here, the ling awaited Ha Anh!

I hold the door open for people leaving, some guys just standing there staring at me as I wave him past courteously. A few more seconds and he replies with a snarl,\"I'm going behind you.\" To my amazement, this douche is my waiter. First of all, he's white, dont take that the wrong way, but people want the whole Asian experience while in this part of town, not some ass**** with a chip on his shoulder for a waiter. 

The while time he was very short and snide with me, I say thank you after requesting service, not one time did he say you're welcome. Not once, unacceptable. I was beside myself with anger, I could not even enjoy my food. 

I ordered the teriyaki salmon, it was not bad, cooked a few min too long, it was not flakey as it should have been. It was more chicken-like than salmon. The seafood pancakes were not too bad, I expected better, maybe it was because of my wait-ress experience, what a girly man. 

I hope I can come back here to a much better experience sometime. I would truly love to edit this review with a positive outlook..."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for months, and finally made it over yesterday to satisfy a craving for anything Korean.  The place is cute and cozy, tucked away in the shopping center with Superior Pho, another great food option.  I completely disagree with Mike B's review and it makes me wonder, has he ever been to a Korean restaurant?  Service is uniformly bad.  Don't expect them to coddle you and tell you about their specials or suggest a wine pairing -- it doesn't work that way.  They'll take your order, bring you banchan and rice, and bring out your entree.  If your water glass is refilled at any point without having to ask, immediate 5 stars!

Anyway, the banchan was really good -- awesome spicy fishcake, potato tempura, and fresh kimchi, and some cucumber thing.  This place is a rice/noodle/stew place, so if you're looking for Korean BBQ, go to Seoul Hot Pot.  In all honesty, my soon dubu was pretty bland (tons of tofu, not much spicy stew), and I wouldn't order it again and my dduk bok ee was just so so, but it still gets four stars because there are like 7 other dishes on the menu that I can't wait to order, and aren't available at other restaurants.  Also, most things are $8 or less, so it really is a great value.  Overall, I'm excited to have another Korean restaurant in Cleveland that isn't Korea House, which is terrible, or Seoul Hot Pot, which is good but kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I come here more for sushi than I do for the Korean food. When you check in there is an offer for a free maki roll and 10% off. 

Ordered the chirashi bowl, which is a sampling of fresh sashimi in vat of seasoned sushi rice. For $18, this is very filling so wear your elastic pants, or be a Samaritan and share it with someone. I would estimate perhaps about 15 pieces which includes tuna, salmon, escolar, octopus and shrimp.

As a Korean tradition, no meal is without its banchan. They serve about six of these side dishes and seem happy to refill as you please. Usually it's kimchi, some bean sprout, something tofu, dried fish etc.

I've also had the bulgogi, which I would definitely order again, and again, and again. Comes out sizzling, tasty and plentiful. 

As a side tip, they are closed on Sundays. Ample free parking in the back."}
