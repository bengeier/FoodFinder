{"text":"Fabulous food!!! Buffet style, fresh, tasty, good variety. I love this place. I use to work close-ish would try to get there at least once a month. It's been over a year since I've been.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  My wife's favorites, butter chicken and pakora, are the best anywhere.  The curries I've tried are good but be warned, very spicy.  Tandoori sizzler plates are good too.  We've only been for a la carte dinner, not the buffet."}
{"text":"It's a great place for Indian cuisine.   Food: We went for Chilli Mogo as an appetizer; Jeera Pulau, Baigan Bhartha, Gujarati Dal and Gujarati Roti as mains. While Chilli Mogo, Jeera Pulau, and Baigan Bhartha were good - the star of the meal was Gujarati Dal by miles. Being a Gujarati, I could recognize the homely authentic taste of the dal and it was the closest you can get to the original one which is more towards the sweeter end of the palate than spicy like the rest of India. Definitely to be tried. I am not sure what was Gujarati about the roti since it was pretty much like a standard phulka roti.   Ambiance: It's a standard restaurant ambiance. They have a large seating area - very good for large groups of friends/family. There is a bar at the end of the dining hall. The design and the feel of the place were very much contemporary - close to fine dining experiences.   Service: Service was quite slow but the food quality kind of made up for it. The person waiting on our table seemed like new (probably his first day) since he seemed quite lost and nervous. He forgot to serve water and it was only later that we asked for it, he realized that and apologized.   Overall, a great place to try some fantastic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"The Exotic Indian Cuisine is a gem!  We started off with vegetable sizzlers, vegetable manchurian sizzler, and fish pakora as our appetizers; butter chicken, malai paneer, dal fry, and double extra spicy vindaloo chicken (after asking for something to reduce the effects of the spiciness of the vindaloo, our host provided us yogurt) served with plain rice and naan bread as our main course. All of the food was flavorful and delicious, but the dishes that I enjoyed the most were the fish pakora and the butter chicken with plain rice and naan. For dessert, we had homemade mango, rose, and paan ice cream. I highly recommend trying the homemade ice cream.  Our host was friendly in conduct, knowledgeable of the menu, and helpful to our group. When I say our host was friendly in conduct, I am referring to them making us feel welcomed to the restaurant. One of our friends asked our host how the homemade rose ice cream was made and our host explained in detail the creation process of the ice cream and recommended us to try the rose ice cream. Not only was our host friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful to our group, but they were also attentive to us by providing us refills on water, asking about the food we ordered, and asking if there was anything else we wanted.  Overall, the Exotic Indian Cuisine provides excellent food and service. I will come back again when I am back in Ontario!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken and rice were fabulous! Cooked to perfection. A little less spicy than I like but they will make it according to your preference."}
