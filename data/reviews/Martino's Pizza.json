{"text":"Best pizza in Oakville and probably in GTA. Small family owned place. Owner is super friendly. Pizza is always fresh, topping loaded and delicious. Their house sauce is also amazing. This has become the only place I order pizza from when I'm home in Oakville. Would recommend to everyone 10/10!"}
{"text":"We tried this place based on Yelp reviews. Quick delivery, good prices. Beyond that it was all pretty meh. We got some wings, the Canadian and the Hawaiian. The ham on the Hawaiian was that teeny diced ham you get on frozen pizzas, and my husband, who tried the wings, said the sauce tasted good but the meat was rubbery. The crust was super thick, cheap and tasteless. 

The website is direct from the 90's and a bit confusing. The Hawaiian didn't list pineapple as an ingredient, and I thought, oh, that's weird - no pineapple? I'll try that! But yeah, it does have pineapple...so it IS the Hawaiian you think it is.

Altogether uninspiring. We'll go back to Panago next time. If it weren't for the quick delivery, we'd give it one star."}
{"text":"Ordered this from this pizza place with bf for a delivery dinner. We got the double pizza deal which was about $25 for two medium pizzas w/3 toppings on each two pops and dip. They had a surprising variety of pops, with three types of root beer...The pizza was delicious (just a bit greasy), even if they gave us mushrooms instead of green peppers haha."}
{"text":"Martino's is the Best Pizza in Oakville!! The owner is also just a great guy, he always goes above and beyond, and even though he might look sort of grumpy when you first walk in, he will surprise you at just how much effort he puts into his customer service. I ordered a pizza here on my way home for my hungry preschoolers, and he sliced it into a bunch of tiny slices for them and even brought it out to the car for me so i wouldn't have to unbuckle them all out of their carseats. Fantastic customer service. PERFECT Italian crust, lots and lots of toppings to choose from. highly recommend! We only order from Martino's now!"}
