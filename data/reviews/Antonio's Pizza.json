{"text":"Big fan of the fried chicken here!  Pizzas are good too.  I order from them at least once a week and it is seldom that I ever have any problems and if I do they do their best to fix it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite drunk foods on campus. The BBQ chicken bacon ranch pizza is by far my favorite, especially when they have the thicker Sicilian style. Also really good is the honey mustard chicken. The mac n cheese pizza is a favorite among many of my friends but to me it's too buttery to really taste right. The long line at 2 am is kind of rough, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Antonio's Pizza distinguishes itself from the pizza pack the moment you step inside.

Antonio's has an incredibly large selection to choose from. They not only have the standards - pepperoni, sausage, cheese - but also radical combinations such as tortellini, tacos, or macaroni n' cheese, just to name a few. My personal favorites are the White (white cheeses, basil, oregano, olive oil), BBQ Steak n' Bacon, and Buffalo Chicken Ranch.

Slices are New York style and smothered with toppings. No excess grease and the crust is done to perfection."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza ever!!!! Made it to my door in 30 minutes nice and hot....and you must order a cannoli for dessert! Yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"I ordered a large veggie supreme pizza with BEEF pepperoni and a medium cheese pizza for the kids. When I arrived home I was not disappointed the pizza was delicious! 

Let's talk about the beef pepperoni, it's 100 percent beef! 
It's so good, my kids were trying to eat all of it off my pizza when I wasn't looking  
It was thin sliced and had a lot of flavor, a must try! 

The pizza took about 20 minutes to cook, I asked for a side of garlic butter! Wow make sure you order some. They had a decent menu a lot to choose from, I will definitely be back to try something new! 

The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout my ordering! I will post pictures of my pizza and their menu!"}
{"text":"I applaud their creativity with the slices.  I was excited to see a place like this open on Green street, but damn, can you heat your slices?!  They sit there for hours and then they throw it a lukewarm oven for 30 seconds.  I'll eat cold pizza, but I'm not paying $2.50-$3 a slice for it!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great sauce, delicious sausage, and a crust that is soft with a little crunch and flavor to boot.  6 stars if it had just a little more cheese."}
{"text":"Just moved  into town from San Francisco. Was looking for a fabulous pizza place to celebrate my wife's first day at work (her favorite food). Not only was it easy to order while I was sitting in my car using the Yelp app but at the last minute I had to change the delivery time by 30 minutes and the restaurant was happy to oblige. Best of all, the pizza was delicious!! Went very well with the bottle of Champaign I'd got to celebrate our new home! Thank you! Will definitely order from you again. Going to enjoy living here :)"}
{"text":"If the pricing were a little less, I would be handing this place the first FIVE star rating but I'm a cheapskate. The food is fresh and having many visits of experience behind me have had no bad experiences whatsoever. My wife and I love the pizza and the salad from Antonio's. I'm not overly excited about their new location in regards to the parking because it always seems so crowded and congested. With so many competing pizza shops in the area, Antonio's is second to none as my #1 choice. I hope it will be yours as well."}
{"text":"The pizza was just alright, there are better places in parma for sure. It was very greasy. The bacon cheddar jalapeno bites were decent. The cassata cake though.... delicious. And huge!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Bianca White pizza with tomatoes, spinach, onions and parmesan cheese and it was delicious.  They said it would be 45- 60 min.  It did take the full 60 min plus an extra 5, but it was worth the wait.  We only eat pizza a few times a year, so it is great when the place we order from gets it right..and Antonio's did!  We will always order our pizza from Antonio's from now."}
{"text":"I got really really sick from eating one of these pizzas my pizza was reheated and was clearly left there over night. Will never eat here again there is a specific reason this place got closed down and now is reopened. You also can't see it's health permit anywhere!!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and Antonio's came highly recommended by our hotel concierge. We ordered the bruschetta pizza, italiano pizza, and cheesy breadsticks. The pizzas had a lot of flavor with bountiful toppings, but that's pretty much where the highlights of our meal ended. We asked for extra sauce; this request was clearly ignored. Additionally, the cheesy bread was burned, and the crust of the pizzas were nothing special. Honestly, I would've rather ordered Papa Johns. Will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place...I placed an order and was told the typical 45-60 minute wait for delivery. After an 1hr  25 minutes of waiting, I called and I was told the power went out shortly and they were running behind but it's back and I shouldn't have a much longer wait. I was understanding and the person on the phone was very friendly. After continuing to wait for my order I received a call which I was told my order had not made and asked if I still wanted it... I placed it almost 2 hours ago. I don't blame this place for a power outrage and I don't blame the servers but they need to seriously rethink how they handle their customer service and management of issues like this. I don't know if it matters to them, but they lost at least two potential customers today."}
{"text":"I was told they would deliver in 45 mins...Took them two hours to deliver a pizza. When I called after an hour and a half, the guy was rude and did not even apologize. I won't go back because of their poor customer service."}
{"text":"I had a birthday party catered by Antonios Strongsville! Lets start with the peppers and sausage....amazing! Get some good buns to go with and they are a party in themselves. The stuffed cabbage is just as good as mine and that's saying a lot - they are very large and delicious. The rigatoni was a great side and the sauce was nice old Italian style. The mashes potatoes were gone by the second time I checked the food. The hot stuffed peppers were quite the conversation for sometime as they were extremely hot just the way we like them. Amen to the peppers! The buttered corn was perfect and the kids loved it! The star of the show was the cabbage and noodles if you can believe it....everyone went on and on about them. We are a family of croatian Italians and this was the perfect combination for all of us. The best thing was I didn't have to cook and everyone went crazy over the food! Antonios catering is now my go to for all of my parties and holidays. Let them do the cooking- it's perfect and the pricing is very reasonable. We fed 25 people at least  3 times for $150 bucks...it doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Antonio's had solid, greasy New york style pizza by the slice.  If I was going for that style pizza and I wasn't just eating there because it was on campus, however, I would head out on Neil and Kirby to hit Vinny's."}
{"text":"The food is usally good, but they can never get the order correct and they are not consistent, which is frustrating!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They made me an awesome heart shaped pizza, the tastiest pizza around! I recommend this place to everyone. The VV stands for vice versa. They even included an arrow!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, service not so much.  Last time ordering was told 30 minutes for delivery. After an hour we received a call our pizza was \"in transit\". No apology or explanation. Delivery guy showed up 25 minutes later and i casually asked him what happened. He responded with \"not my problem\". Will take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The only reason we didn't give this place five stars was because of the price. Don't think we'll be ordering again without a coupon."}
{"text":"Can't believe the lame reviews this place is getting -- It's one of the best slices of pizza you can get, hands down. I am so excited it's OPEN again!

You want black bean avocado pizza (rare, but my favorite)? Steak & bacon? Chicken pesto tortellini? The slices are always creative but delicious, so be brave! It's what sets this place apart, and it's probably tastier than you would imagine! The hardest thing about going to Antonio's is choosing which slice to get. Note these are thin crust style, so if you're looking for that bread-filled deep dish monstrosity that some people call pizza, this is not it.

Hits the spot when you just got out of Murphys at 2am. Personally, I like to stop by at lunch. The slices are gigantic so you get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Food is very good, but service can be slow at times. My only complaint is the pricing, this place is very expensive. 2 medium pizza's cost us $32."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Chambana land. Big New York style pizza slices and man do they have options. They have so many different kinds of pizzas with combinations you would never even think of - from putting pasta tortellini on there, Mexican pizzas with actual tortilla chips, baked potatoes, and they all taste awesome! 

My all time favorite though is the Chicken Bacon Ranch SICILIAN slices, I could seriously have that be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life. Great place to come for the drunken munchies after the bars or at any other time of the day. Be warned though, if you go after the bars close or near that time you will be standing around for quite a while...but so worth it!"}
{"text":"I really like this style of pizza, they don't do the best job in the world but it's hard to complain.  They always have a big selection of classic/veg/weird toppings on the slices to pick from and the crust is way way better than any of the standard cardboard chain stuff you might find down the street.  I wish I knew when the slices were freshest, like a krispy kreme hot light or something.  Either way it's still an extremely cheap, pretty yummy Green St option.  

It's not really the kind of place people stay for more than 15 min and I sometimes wonder if part of it is that they always have a really cheesy 80's/pop station playing loudly in the background."}
{"text":"We placed an order two days in advance for a business meeting to feed 35 employees.   They had the delivery time requested an hour later than needed and missed the late delivery by 40 minutes! Do not order from this location if time is an issue."}
{"text":"I like their florentine pizzas. It's a nice place to grab lunch since they sell by the slice."}
{"text":"We frequent Antonio's on a regular basis, and they are hands down the best pizza-by-the-slice in town! 

They make a variety of unique and creative pizzas- that are always served fresh. Spicy Beef Taco, Chicken Florentine, and Chicken, Bacon, Ranch- just to name a few. My go-to slice is the Chicken Quesadilla! Absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"We had the Sophia pasta. it was delicious. The pizza was amazing. The service was fast and the garlic were the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza spot!, have ate there for lunch a few times.  I've gotten the 2 slices and a drink combo for $5 everytime. The slices are huge and the chef threw in some garlic knots both times."}
{"text":"Love Antonio's! It's the perfect late night craving spot. The tortellini pizza is yum-o! The staff is super fun, the music is always loud, and the staff are singing/dancing away, totally enjoying themselves. It's the most crowded around 2, when the bars close, but the wait is never more than a few minutes. I've never eaten it before 1 am, but it's a great after bar place. And cheap too!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza slices are large and filling. It is also very inexpensive. One of my favorite places to eat on campus and take friends that come to visit! They have a type of pizza for everyone"}
{"text":"Just like the rest of life, it's best when you're drunk and so out of it you just don't care anymore or forget who you are and why you exist. Worst part is sometimes eating sobers you up."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, really great prices.  A very filling meal for two is under $10.  The pizza is best if you go when it's crazy busy so that your slices are fresh.  A visit on a slow evening during the summer will net you luke warm slices (even after their trip through the little oven), which are not quite as good but still better than most of the other pizza places on campus and still a great bargain."}
{"text":"Good pizza great salad the mediterranean salad and artichoke salad is awesome especially the vinaigrette dressing they make its delicious good quality customer service!"}
{"text":"When I first came to U of I, I liked this place.  It is close to the main quad (as opposed to many places that are past  6th or 5th street) and it is convenient if you need a quick bite

Pizza quality is \"meh\", pretty oily, crust is lacking with regard to flavor. 

They have daily specials such as \"buy 2 slices get a free drink\" and \"buy 2 slices and get a 3rd slice free\", but I have not had good experience with these.  The first time I went, I bought 2 slices and as the person was ringing me up, I saw the sign on the side and inquired about my free drink (it was during the free drink time), she responded, with much attitude \"you could have told me!\", but she did give me my drink.  

Another time I went during the \"buy 2 get a 3rd free\" time, and asked for 2 slices of cheese pizza.  As they were being reheated, I was asked to pay, so I did.  Still waiting for my pizza to be reheated, I noticed the sign.  I inquired about the 3rd slice but was told that I had to have asked before paying.  I asked if I could be refunded and then they could reprocess my order, but the guy said he couldn't do that.  He said he had to \"keep track\" of the pizzas, otherwise he would get fired (mind you I have seen them throw away old pizza slices when they are running out of room for their new pizzas).  He then went on about the various signs everywhere displaying the deals (which by the way are small) and how his outdoor sign kept falling over.   I didn't feel the need to argue any further, so I waited for my pizza.  The guy then stepped back and whispered to the other guys behind the counter, after which they \"just happened\" to say the same things he did, pointing out the same outdoor sign and all.  

I took my pizza and left, and don't really feel like going there again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, pasta and breadsticks.  We ordered from their catering menu for a party and you definitely get a lot for your money.  Great place to order from if you are having a party or event!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, waited three hours.NO pizza and they wouldn't answer the phone. So I drove there, they told me they didn't open till ten p.m. It's the next day still nothing I had to call delivery.com and cancel my order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite delivery place nearby. They are fairly quick with the orders and the pizza is amazing.  The pasta dishes are good too.  I would have given a five star review except their suns are not great and I think they could be a little cheaper.  That being said we still order from them all of the time."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy hearing the old Italian a patriarch berate his employee (daughter/granddaughter) over nothing. He should have taken that to the back room.  

No fountain drinks. Poor air conditioning. Eat in Pizza is probably not the way to go, this is a takeout type of joint. The pizza is the draw, not the atmosphere. 

Cheese pizza was a hit with the kids. I enjoyed the Grandma Sicilian pizza too."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I love the specialty ones...especially their bbq chicken one. It is seriously delicious. It is also pretty cheap considering the quality and portion size; never paid over four bucks. Open late so really good option on for those post-green street bar night but beware it WILL get crowded around that time. 

Clean. Fantastic music as well. Love me some Antonios."}
{"text":"We like the pizza, but opted tonight to have it delivered. Big mistake! Was told it would be 45 minutes, and when it wasn't here an hour later, I called and was told it \"was on the road\" and would be here in 15 minutes. When a half hour went by, I called again, and was told \"the driver was five minutes away.\"  I was calling to cancel 15 minutes later when he finally pulled into the driveway. Pizza was cold, but we were too hungry to care. I live five miles away from the place - if they had just been honest with me, I would have gone to pick it up."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today, as this was a place that I had heard older students rave about, and it finally reopened.  It's decent by-the-slice New York-style pizza.  I think Antonios' hook is that they have an incredibly creative selection of toppings, rather than the pizza being out-of-this-world based on its crust, or cheese, or some other particular item.  That said, the prices were quite reasonable, and the food was good.  I'll definitely be going back there in the future."}
{"text":"In my personal opinion, I think this place has the best pizza on campus. They sell pizza by the slice and I've never went to a place with such creative pizza toppings! I always crave this place so much when I go back home"}
{"text":"It's good for a quick lunch. Nothing too special, but its walkable from my office and a slice is less than $4.  Thus, I can eat more cheaply than any of the nearby sandwich places."}
{"text":"From out of town, asked where to get a great Pizza, everyone said Antonio's. This place will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you. the minute you walk in here you can see this is a business that cares about it's customers. It's obvious that care went into every aspect of this business. The flavor decor cleanliness staff value everything is so much more than you would ever expect in a place that has a $4,99 rigatoni lunch. I can't praise it enough. ALWAYS a great experience.j We drove by it for years without ever trying iit, from the outside it just didn't look like a restaurant worth going out of the neighborhood for but...\" the minute you walked in the joint......\" my entire family loves it"}
{"text":"ordered the Alfredo fettuccini with sausage. good quality of both pasta and meat, but unfortunately the Alfredo & sausage were so bland that I had to LOAD it up with salt to make it have any flavor at all. salad dressings definitely weren't the tastiest. really nice wait staff with great service though, and deserts are delicious. another in my group ordered the lasagna, which was very tasty. if you're going to order from here, go with the red sauces."}
{"text":"Had a late drive to the Hampton Inn Brooklyn OH. Asked for pizza menus from the front desk and was given several.  Not this one.  After yelping I made my mind up to try Antonio's. The guy on the phone was very helpful and friendly. He even made every attempt to get me the best deal for what I wanted. Food delivered fast, hot and good!! The fresh ingredient claim is spot on.  A little light on sauce but besides that very yummy."}
{"text":"Folks....I have found Pizza Heaven.... I ordered a deep dish mushroom and cheese deep dish...many pizza places seem to thing deep dish is bigger dough...well...no...that is a bigger dough pizza...this is deep dish.... awesome dough, cheese and..whatever you add!... in a deep setting!..wow...i tell a pizza is bad or good...by the weight, and when the delivery guy handed me this pie...wow...heavy...the aroma quickly turned on the salivating glands...lol..i asked for light sauce...they put on the exact amount i wanted.... if i was on death row, and they asked me what i wanted for my last meal...it would come from here...so, antonio's Thank you for showing a foodie like me that pizza places in the old brooklyn/parma area can still make pizzas...not many but you folks are kings!..:)"}
{"text":"Was not all that great. They had a lunch special for 2 slices of pizza and 5 wings. They tell you as you get the counter only \"cheese\" pizza. And the wings were small as my pinky finger. Never again......"}
{"text":"Ordered several times.  Strongsville was great, Brunswick location constantly delivers undercooked doughy pizza.  No good."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice for lunch.....  Fantastic Idea...  Plus its the biggest piece of pizza you could imagine.  Well worth the $2-$2.50 price.  If you go please try the Sausage it is fantastic.  I also am excited cause they are building one in Macedonia right on 82 and 8.  I must also say their chicken is also delicious.  I remember when I was a kid going to Parmatown Mall Food Court for me it was Antonio's..  What can I say I am a pizza junkie....."}
{"text":"Antonio's has always been a childhood favorite so we order this one very often. We usually need a bigger pizza ....half sheet with lots of toppings. It's a 30.00 + pizza. Their coupons never really give their customers who order like this any deals. So the flyer I had said order large one topping pizza and get 12 pepperoni nuggets. I asked the order taker ( we usually order for delivery) if we could get the nuggets with our order. He said no our system wont let me put that in. 

Basically, they have a loyal customer who hands out double the amount needed for their nuggets but you cant get them.

Most workers cannot make these managerial decisions and I understand that so I wrote to Antonio's online letting them know what happened and I have yet to hear from them.

Just bad service. I won't be back. 

Thank God for Marsella's on York!

Ciao Antonios! so Lame!

Since Contacting Antonio's they sent me a 5.00 gift cert. The cost of Nuggets is 5.95 on their menu so this does not even cover a free appetizer. Still disappointed but at least they acknowledged me."}
{"text":"I'm already 5 years post college, yet on my last trip down, I ended up here at 2am. Guess I'm just a sucker for this place. It closed during my last few years of college so I was really jealous when it opened back up.

I remember I went here once during the day and just thought....why am I eating this.... I would recommend going only after drinking, because you're really only coming here for the toppings and not the actual pizza part.

I really need to switch it up though, I always get the mac and cheese and then some form of meat pizza, chicken buffalo, meat lovers, etc. Though delicious, maybe i'm just missing out on the other choices. I'm sure I'll be back, and hopefully my drunken self decides to be a little adventurous, but who knows what he's thinking...."}
{"text":"The mexican/avocado pizza is to die for.  You must try it now!  If not that, they have tons of variety to suit any kind of taste."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and went ahead with the antipasto salad, pep and sausage pie with extra crispy, buffalo ranch wings. I'm pretty far from here so I was cool with the one hour delivery time. Delivery girl was great, no complaints there.

If you are an Italian sausage lover, they have the 'good sausage' here. Salty pepperoni and nice cheese. My favorite thing about the pie was the crust. Great chew. My wings were cooked nicely, crispy on the outside and no rubbery guts. Im not a fan of the mild sauce, I tasted hot sauce only. The salad was loaded, I mean loaded with meat, beans, olives, banana peppers, cheese, egg, everything but the kitchen sink. Iceberg lettuce meh. The Italian dressing was way too sweet for my liking. 

I placed a second order, same salad (it's above average). This time I was able to specify what items I didn't want on the salad (green olives and banana peppers). This time I went with the deep dish pizza with pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms, green pepper and onion. My mistake, there was way too much going on. I would prob be raving about it if only had only one topping or just cheese. Heads up, the toppings don't seem to get cooked at all (like they do when their on top of the pie). So I ended up with raw veggies, and pepperoni without the depth that you get from the oven. Canned mushrooms? I deduct stars for that sh*t.

Definitely a solid meal, I would definitely consider them up there in my top 3 pizza delivery places in the lake."}
{"text":"RATINGS CHANGE?!?!?
I may have to change the rating for this place.  I think that their loyal customers deserve more than a sign on the door saying \"Closed Today\" for the last month and a half.  Do they plan to ever reopen?  Anyway, the rating below reflects when they were in business.  I'd give them only one star now for the way they've handled whatever is going on.  
-------------------------
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PIZZA PLACE???  I went there to get my daily fix and they were closed for cleaning.  That was May 9th and they still haven't reopened.  Anyone know what's going on???  I NEED MY PIZZA!!!
-------------------------
Pizza by the slice.  That alone rates raves.  Good pizza by the slice.  Now that's awesome.  Good, very-much-like-Brooklyn pizza by the slice.  Can't top that.   I stick to the traditional Italian toppings.   Antonio's comes very close to the Brooklyn pizza I grew up with and I like stopping by for a slice or two or three.  Staff is very friendly, too.  Fun guys who seem to enjoy their work.  My only complaint is its location and the lack of parking.  I work nearby, so it's not a problem during the week, but over the weekend, when I'd really like some slices, it's not very convenient.  Open another in Urbana!!!  Maybe the Godfather can make them an offer they can't refuse."}
{"text":"They offer pizza by the slice daily at lunch time and even offer a great daily special.  You have to get a slice of their sausage pizza and the famous Antonio's salad, loaded with mozzarella cheese and toasted pepperoni on top.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating whenever I stop in for lunch.  They always offer napkins and plates to go as well.  Some of the best pizza around."}
{"text":"the guy over the phone was rude. the food was too pricey and it was all soooo greasy! the italian dressing is straight oil! i will not order from here again!"}
{"text":"Antonio's is just one of the many pizza places in Champaign Urbana and they do a relatively good job. 

Antonio's sells thin New York style slices and whole pies if you want them and their menu is very expansive from tex-mex to chicken-pesto. They always have a something different everyday.

For me, I usually stick to a slice of mushroom and a slice of Sicilian pizza. The Sicilian is a thick crust pizza with a sweet sauce, it's really delicious. The are vegetarian options galore from artichoke pizza to pasta pizza. The food overall is definitely food on the go I'd say catering to the student lunch and drunk 1am crowd. Antonio's would definitely hit the spot to satisfy that hunger while you're drunk. Prepare for some clogged arteries because their pizza is pretty greasy, but I don't complain. The flavors aren't complex, but we're talking pizza here folks.  

2 slices of pizza will probably run you from $4 to $6 so you definitely get full.

Note: Their water is free, but the temperature in the sports looking water cooler is usually tepid. Pop is $1 and refills are 50 cents.

I've never ordered delivery, but I image that would be a nightmare (I've only seen one Antonio's car in their lot) so stick to dine in or carry out.

Looking for cheap, greasy, satisfying food? Look no further than Antonio's."}
{"text":"A Cleveland landmark for generations. Always great food. They are never the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. If you want cheap cardboard pizza, then Antonio's is not for you."}
{"text":"When I first started ordering delivery from Antonio's, the food was good, for the most part. Their pasta dishes were okay. I ordered mostly was their four piece chicken dinner with JoJos and Cole Slaw. At first, this was a very good meal. The past three times I've ordered this, the chicken wasn't that great and the Jojos were worse. I will not be ordering from them any time soon."}
{"text":"The WORST customer service ever. The young lady who took my order and answered my call when my wings didn't come with ranch or blue cheese treated me like I was lucky to have them accept my order. Then I learn that they charge extra for ranch or blue cheese with an order of wings. 1st they should say so when you order because every other establishment on the planet serves ranch or blue cheese with an order of wings. 2nd they shouldn't charge for it. By charging it says they are greedy and cheap. After the young lady passed me to get manager because she didn't care or have the energy or time to bother with me the manager said he'd send some over. 30 bucks in good and a 7.00 tip to get treated like shit and charged for ranch w my wings. No thanks!"}
{"text":"This is my fiance's preferred pizza place. The location is pretty convenient for us, and it has grown on me. My one negative here is that I'm not fond of the wings, but I am also very particular about wings as I was spoiled growing up near Buffalo, NY.
Pay attention to your mailbox before you come here, because they often have several coupons available. This is a huge plus for me, as we are able to get good quality, and a reasonable price.
The last time we came here, we used one of their coupons, which was two small specialty pizzas and one small one topping pizza for $19.99 (normally these small specialties would be $13.49 individually). We got a deluxe (minus the mushrooms), Nana's BBQ chicken, and a pizza with banana peppers. We both enjoyed all 3 of our selections. Personally, I am a big fan of their thicker crusts, bt they also offer Sicilian and Rustico (thin) options.
Based off location, quality, and the reasonable prices (especially after the coupons), a place where we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Enjoyable! I love how creative this pizza joint is. They do a great job on both traditional and innovative pizza toppings. I recommend anything with spinach and feta, though they do wonders with a bit of avocado and salsa. Be adventurous and try something, everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half for delivery on a Thursday night. Called after an hour and the manager told me if they're not there in 5 minutes, call me back and I'll refund you. What do you know, exactly 5 minutes later they show.  Cold pizza and warm salad. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"LOVE Antonio's. Their slices are large and often available in any variety. Chicken Bacon Ranch is by far one of my top pizzas on campus, I order it every time and it never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I've never, not once left a review for any place of business let alone a bad one. And if I could give it \"0 stars\" I would because it doesn't even desrerve the 1 it make you give. But this was probably the worst spaghetti I've ever eaten. It was watery, overcooked, and had barely any sauce. I ordered online and when my food arrived they forgot the rest of my my order. So obviously I called and informed the manager. Well after another almost 40 minutes of waiting they delivered the rest of my order (italiano nuggets) and I had asked for a few sides of sauce along with that because my meal had none. Well they didn't bring my sauce. I could have went to McDonald's and saved time and money and I would at least know what I was getting."}
{"text":"Let me admit something: my favorite type of pizza is a white pizza. I know this is sacrilegious to some, but white pizza for me hits a spot that no other type of pizza can. And when it comes to white pizza, Antonio's The Bianca (White) is the absolute best around. It's garlicy, cheesy, well seasoned with italian herbs, and has delicious spinach and tomatoes to balance it all out. Antonio's crust is also amazing. It's truly unbeatable in my opinion.

As for those of you who prefer a more \"traditional\" pizza: Antonio's red sauce is delicious. It's well balanced, not too sweet like some restaurants, and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Antonios makes one mean pie, time after time, delicious!  The new Una Bella is to die for.  Service is fast and easy to get to.  No dine in but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"The staff is so incredibly nice! The restaurant was clean and up to date. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the pizza sauce was a little on the sweet side (something I am not used to) but it was interesting to try! Other than that it was a great experience, the Antonio's Special Salad was great!"}
{"text":"Seriously not okay with my experience. A customer made me feel like I was sexually assaulted. I brought it to the attention of the manager. I asked for this person to be removed from the establishment. The manager just pushed me aside and refused to listen to the situation. He instead on \"telling me\" how it really is. I'm a victim of sexual assault. I'm also a general manager of a restaurant. If I EVER had a customer complain about feeling assaulted, I would never tell them \"how it is\". I would do everything in my power to make that customer feel safe. I am astounded that this person is in management. I don't care that everyone in the store at the time is drunk. If you have a customer assaulting other customers, take care of it. Don't tell a woman \"how it is\" and refuse to listen. I've never been so upset to where I don't even want to visit a town because a manager of a restaurant refused to help not only me, but other people with me who felt unsafe. I will absolutely not visit again because the staff supported rape culture, and didn't even attempt to rectify the situation. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Omg wow simply impressive for a pizzeria The food is top notch and has a old world Italian sauce flavor without being too stingy on toppings. It can definitely surprise you."}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent if you like thick soft crust and sweeter tomato sauce. My only issue was the garlic parmesean wings. I ordered a pound and received 8 small wings that were literally immersed in cups and cups of oil. I poured the oil into the sink.. otherwise it was like trying to bob for apples, that's how much oil there was. I am hoping this is a one-off, but if not, just know it was so strange and unpleasant."}
{"text":"12/29/2016 -

I stay on the east side of Cleveland & would drive all the way to Chevrolet Blvd for how great this store is & I've been to others, & actually live 8 mins from the Solon store. 

I ordered the deep dish pizza with pepperoni & 2lbs of Golden BBQ wings. The pizza & the toppings were excellent & after a 30 mins drive back. The wings were great & enough to feed 3 grown men. 

Also when I walked in to pick up my order the cashier was out in the lobby straightening up & soon as she heard me come in she stopped, spoke (which I'm very big on) & reassured me she'll be right there. Although she didn't show me the pizza I didn't care because it was a excellent meal for me & my buddies. 

As far as Antonio's go I'll only go here from here on out."}
{"text":"Waited over two hours for my order. I called and they told me the order had left the shop and should be delivered any minute. After another 25mins I called back to cancel the order. What really upset me was they made no attempt to apologize and seemed bothered by the fact I called to check on my order. Probably wouldn't have been so upset if they wouldn't have charged my credit card. I love Antonios Pizza but I'll never use this location again."}
{"text":"What we love is their dinners through delivery.  The chicken parmesean is so tasty and it comes with ravioli or rigatoni, plus salad and garlic bread for like $11. You can't beat that price and there's always some leftover for the next day!!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! Super creative slices of pizza and for a good price, too. I got a HUGE piece of tortellini pizza and a large soda for $4.70. The guys who work there were joking around with me and super nice the whole time. Every college campus should have a place like this!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place out being that I've been on a search for authentic NY style pizza in Charlotte, and I'm happy to say that I finally found it. I've been fooled several times before by reviews and claims of pizza spots having NY style pizza, only to come across either bland sauce, or to much cheese. Antonios pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese. The sauce was perfect. The only complaint I have is that the garlic knots were a little dry and I wasn't given a marinara sauce to dip them in. Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good slice of pizza NY style."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, graduate school is hard and often horrible.  There are times when you are reading nine hundred pages, writing a ridiculous paper or four, and teaching classes.  Sometimes life becomes simply unbearable.  This is why there is Antonio's.  

Antonio's is a tiny space of joy in a world that can be excessively painful.  I imagine it as an island of tranquility, if that tranquility comes equipped with some of the most ridiculous pizza ideas ever and a host of smooth nineties slow jams.  And that is what I need every Monday afternoon, when Antonio's has a buy one slice get one free special.  So I pay about $3 for two huge slices of pizza and a half hour of belting out Toni Braxton, Babyface, maybe if I'm lucky a little Alicia Keys?  Hell yes.

The slices themselves range from inspired to bizarre to terrifying, but they generally mange to pull of the crazy flavour combinations.  They have gyro, nachos, fresh mozzarella with pesto, potato wedges and bacon, and any number of other combinations.

So on a Monday afternoon, you can find me sitting over a double slice of heaven, singing \"You'll Always Be My Baby.\"  And I wouldn't have it any other way, Antonio's."}
{"text":"This is a review for Antonio's in Wadsworth. No Yelp listing for some reason. Guessing it's the same everywhere though as it's a chain. Undercooked, soggy, doughy pizza! Sauce is very bland! Expensive for pizza with \"premium\" toppings. Have given this place 4 chances in last year or so. Sorry but pretty gnarly pie. Seriously would rather make a frozen disk."}
{"text":"The pizza is overpriced and under filling. I ordered two sausage slices which tasted like they had been sitting in the trash for days to be reheated. I can't see this place being appetizing to anyone unless they're at least 6 shots deep with a couple of benzos on board."}
{"text":"all pizza slices are so tasty and great prices! owner is super nice and pizza is unbeatable! love
this place so much. student or alumni I will always visit Antonios"}
{"text":"Antionio's is a very good Pizza.  I have eaten there since they opened there first restaurant in the small shopping center at Snow and Stumph in the 1960's.  They have since expanded all over the south west suburbs.  While I still enjoy them, I now think that Angies in North Royalton has a better prouduct, by just a little.  I have not tried the deep dish as I don't classify that as 'pizza'.  For a thin crust almost exactly like i NYC try Anselmos on Sprague Rd."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant. We were looking for a break from the chain restaurants and found this delicious restaurants. We got a pizza that was a great \"New York\" style pizza. We also had the stuffed shells with ricotta cheese and the eggplant parmigiana. We really enjoyed these dishes as well and were stuffed by the large portions. I almost felt guilty after paying less that $35 to feed 3 adults and 2 kids a wholesome Italian dinner. All in all it is restaurants like this that make you feel great about supporting small business owner. Go ahead and check this place out. Two big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great selection and great value. We had the Mac and cheese, the spicy beef taco and the avocado quesadilla slice. All were outstanding. One slice is enough for a meal. The 3 of us shared the slices. A \"must go\" when in C-U. Very creative combinations."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get a quick bite to eat on campus.  The variety of different slices is outstanding and constantly changing depending on the day and the time.  The pizza is delicious, and the guys who work there are a riot and super-friendly.  A quick lunch, after the bars, or really any time, Antonio's has always hit the spot for me."}
{"text":"The management staff is very unprofessional. They make you wait forever before responding. When you call the store they make excuses why they can't answer the phone"}
{"text":"I live in Brunswick Hills and usually order from the Strongsville location but we decided to give the new Brunswick location a whirl. I use the Parmatown location, the location I grew up on, as my measuring stick for all other Antonio's locations and just like all of the others this one made a good pie; just not as good as the home location but that is to be expected. 

First impression after walking in was chaos. High school kids running around making pizzas and salads. The girl at the counter was very polite, she grabbed my order (LG Sausage, onion, green pepper) and explained it would be a minute bc the computer was being slow. Understandable, can happen anywhere. I got to survey the storefront while waiting and the food prep stations looked clean, everyone was wearing gloves, hats, or hair ties. The interior is brand new and as nice looking as you can get for a pizza store front. Anyway, I paid for my pizza and was on my way.

When I got home I opened the box and it looked like and smelled like an Antonio's pizza so we were on the right track. The crust was crunchy and the dough was light and fluffy, sauce was the same Antonio's pizza sauce (little too much on this one though) and the toppings were fresh and abundant. Solid pizza, probably the best in Brunswick. My only qualm is that they cut it into 15pcs...wtf? How is that even possible, I don't even like 12 pcs...Lg's should be cut into no more than 8 imho. I will definitely go back if I happen to be passing by but will continue to order from the Strongsville location as it is closer. The pie cooled off a little too much for my liking on my way home...nothing against Antonio's...I just don't live close enough. That being said...glad to see you're up in running in Brunswick."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse. If it's busy don't even think about it because the quality of the pizza goes way down. Today is the last time I will ever be burned by this Antonio's. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and onion and it was terrible. You could tell it was thrown together at light speed. Too much sauce, pepperonis that were stacked 3 deep, and the pizza was way undercooked. The pepperonis on the bottom of the stack didn't cook which was pretty gross. All in all a horrible experience and the final straw with this place. If you're gonna charge the prices that you charge stop giving people crap in a box and calling it pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in CU.

White pizza is excellent. 

They do have odd closings at times."}
{"text":"As far as CLE pizza goes, Antonio's, I like you.  I wish you had fresh garlic to ass to your za, but aside from that you're good!  Thank you for having real sauce in the CLE."}
{"text":"So good. What a great crust! The Westlake location is the best. We had the Maui Wowi-butter sauce with provolone, chunks of ham, bacon and pineapple tidbits. My daughter and I will definitely get this one again. The pepperoni had a lot of pepperoni on it, but I like it a bit less saucy. My son really liked it."}
{"text":"Admittedly I'm not a pizza fan, but now I am.  Their pizza is amazing and the pepperoni nuggets are phenomenal.   Skip the big name chains and go here for a great meal."}
{"text":"Good pie.  If you ask one of my coworkers, they'd say this stuff cures cancer and aids.  I'm saying there's definitely better in the Cleveland area.  I'd also say the dining room and bathroom isn't clean enough.  The salads aren't healthy, they're not really even salads.  They have a half pound of cheese, 17 pieces of pepperoni and a half a head of iceberg.  If you want to make it more of a 4 star experience, get takeout pizza."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine pizza. The sauce is on the sweet side, which I like. The dough is thick, which I don't. The staff was friendly but seemed overwhelmed."}
{"text":"As my friend put it, \"this is great drunk food.\"  The large $2 slices are great for a quick bite before or after drinking/studying/whatnot but not for an actual MEAL. I do like to stop by this place on most of my visits to Champaign, though."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing. Generous toppings. Reasonably priced. Great customer service. Too bad they don't deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"We've tried this place a few times. It sort of reminds me of Little Caesars, but the last time it seemed that there was something missing with the flavor. Maybe the cheese and sauce are missing SOMETHING. It's kinda bland...I don't know if we would  be back again. The pizza is OK..."}
{"text":"I got a small margherita pizza that was very good- not too much sauce or cheese, thinly sliced tomatoes, chopped basil, and chopped garlic sprinkled over the top- delicious. I love margherita pizza but it can be hard to find in Charlotte. 

I also got fries (fine) and cheesecake (pretty good). Delivery was fast enough, and the driver was polite. Will definitely have again!"}
{"text":"It's alright.  Staying at HIE and didn't want to venture out for dinner so I ordered delivery from here.  Poor kid taking my order had to be new cause he was not on it.  After the frustration of finally getting my order placed, when I hung up the phone I realized he had not asked me for my room number.  Long story short.  It Finally Found Me!  
TRADITIONAL CURST WITH ALFREDO, CHICKEN, BACON AND TOMATOES - I like a thinner crust.  Needed the toppings closer to the edge as it all cooked in towards the middle.
TOASTED RAVIOLI - I assumed they would be meat but they were cheese filled.  They were fine for for frozen but the pizza sauce was like water!  Can't even imagine I would like that crap on the traditional crust!"}
{"text":"They may be open late, but Antonio's pizza is good any time of the day! They have a great selection of unique pizza flavors, which is saying a lot coming from this hungry vegetarian. Try their Tomato Basil Mozzarella or Tortellini pizza - there's truly nothing like it. Who'd a thought to put all these crazy, delicious ingredients on a pizza?

Basically, everything about Antonio's is wonderful: big slices for low prices, ultra friendly (and patient) staff, and comfy casual/slightly retro ambiance to hang with friends.

Absolutely addicted to this place. Pretty sure they're beginning to recognize me...

Note: I know it may seem like it but I was not paid to write this review. But Antonio's if you're reading this, I will gladly accept pizza as payment. On that note, reader, make sure to grab a punch card on your way out. You're going to need it, trust me."}
{"text":"We had pizza, wings and salad for an employees going away party. The food was great. The Italian dressing is one of my favorite salad dressings."}
{"text":"Antonio's Pizza is one of the best delivery pizza places in the Cleveland areas.  Typically we order the Spinach and Artichoke Pizza because it is my fiance's favorite (I like it too).  It is amazing!  The last time we ordered from Antonio's, I discovered that they have deep dish.  I strongly recommend the deep dish if you are a fan of true Chicago-style pizza.  I've had many deep dish pizzas but none of them have held a flame against Giordano's in Chicago.  Anotonio's deep dish pizza is as good as Giordano's and you don't need a plane ticket to get it.  Again I highly recommend the deep dish or the Spinach & Artichoke pizza at Antonio's Pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered from the catering menu for my daughter's baptism.  I cannot say enough about the amazing quality of the food!!!  We ordered the Rome package for $9.99 a person- included chicken cutlets, sausage & peppers, baked ziti (covered in gooey cheese), mixed veggies, redskin potatoes, a huge bowl of salad, and a tray of breadsticks.  Seriously- it was all so delicious!! It was ready at 11:00 as promised, was piping hot, and everyone commented on how fabulous the food tasted.  I will definitely be using them again in October for a birthday party!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"Kinda Cranky on the phone so I use the internet...no better Pizza in the world...plus the fried chicken and jojos..a must try...only neg was the stombolies are hit or miss... but the deep dish is...deep dish not deep crust!....enjoy!."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pepperoni w/mushroom, light sauce, pizza from Antonio's in Westlake  on 10-3-16 to share with friends.  We picked it up.  It was ready when they said it would be.  I believe it cost just at $20.  The crust is better than average and the amount of toppings was just right but the pepperoni tasted a bit different from the norm.  Overall it was a pretty tasty pizza.  Granted, pepperoni isn't even a real food, at least not in my mind, so I should not make disparaging comments about it.  Still, I love good pepperoni on my pizza.  This large pizza would have been more than plenty for 4 hungry people, so we had leftovers.  I think it tasted better cold this morning than hot last night, but again, that's my personal preference.  I'd give this pizza 4 stars if the pepperoni tasted better to me."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on service as the pizza is usually yummy (still not as good as the Parma location of course but that's hard to do).  

I walked in today to pick up my order that I placed online and was informed that they forgot to make one of the pizzas and asked if I wanted to wait for it... What other option did I have but to wait?  There was no apology and no discount but I sat and patiently waited for my pizza.  When the manager came to give me my new pizza, he did not apologize either but instead told me they had a lot of new help for the holidays.  He forgot my garlic bread and seemed baffled when I asked for it... He said they must have made a new one so that it wasn't cold (which is a really nice thought but now my other pizzas were getting cold waiting for the bread).  

I understand mistakes happen, which is why I was fine with waiting, but I certainly think an \"I'm sorry\" would have gone a long way!"}
{"text":"I thought Za's had the most diverse pizza choices until I can here. Za's offers nearly infinite permutations of toppings, but Antonios offers other forms of diversity in the form of quirky crusts and toppings. There is tortellini pizza covered with surprise!-oodles of tortellini or the chicken blue pizza, which is basically a chicken wing on a crust. Personally, I like the sicilian cheese pizza, which has a buttery flaky crust that beats out any other pizza in the area. However, I do think freshness and ingredient quality is a problem here, as well as typical American-pizza greasiness. It's better than many of the pizza places on Green st., but still suffers from college-pizza syndrome."}
{"text":"Look, I don't live here, and I know nothing about Antonio's Pizza.  I was interested in learning about their pizza, and so I ordered some.  Thing is, it never arrived.  About an hour after ordering, we called.  We were assured it was running behind and the driver had left 40 min ago.  Well, at this point we were looking forward to the prospect of 40 minute old pizza, but, not to worry, it never showed up.  We tried calling several times afterwards and no one answered.
I sincerely hope everyone at Antonio's is well, and that some tragic incident didn't interrupt our pizza, but never before has pizza just not showed up.  At least the courtesy of a phone call, you ask?  Nothing."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place on campus. The toppings are always unique and you have about a bazillion to choose from, the slices are huge, and the price is good. I never get the same toppings twice, and I've never had a bad experience. 

Usually I go here after a night out, but it's not your typical disgusting-unless-you're-drunk food. You can happily eat Antonio's at any time of the day. The staff are saints for dealing with the belligerent drunks that yell slurred pizza flavors at them, and the jug of water at the front is exactly appropriate. I absolutely believe that their pizza and numerous glasses of water has saved me from hangovers.

I have no idea what people are talking about regarding decor or water presentation. Have you been to a pizza place before? Antonio's is fantastic, end of story."}
{"text":"Ugh haven't been here in over 2 years, but it's just as good as I remember. Love the tortellini pizza, chicken quesadilla pizza, and the best one--Mac and cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I see Antonio's Pizza just got #1 in Cleveland for the best deep dish pizza.
Don't be confused. This is not a 'Chicago Style' pie. This is just a big round calzone with sauce on the top, a top layer of crust, and a lot of crust around the edge. They claim it's 3\" deep, but at most, it's an inch. The crust is regular pizza dough. Not the biscuit type used in Chi-town. So if you're expecting Uno, Malnati's, or Giordano's, this pie isn't for you.
On the other side, their regular 'za is pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I asked to make sure that my to go order has a salad dressing.  Without looking he said \"yes, of course all salads have dressing\"  the salad was dry and not good without dressing.  Doubt I will go back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's really tasty and affordable. Antonio's will become my regular pizza place."}
{"text":"Overrated  and very expensive  pizza.. Subs are light on ingredients  and they charge extra for  everything. We've  tried  Antonio's  many times over the past 10 years hoping  it would  improve but it doesn't. Not sure what all the hype  is about??Average at best"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since I graduated a couple of years ago, but I was around when it opened and ate there almost every week until I left UIUC. Super fast and super cheap is the name of Antonio's game. Not to mention the very interesting pizzas you can try by the slice. 

Make no mistake, this place is NOT fancy (e.g. patrons can get water out of a big orange cooler). But it doesn't need to be. Antonio's is great for a quick lunch/dinner and it is really, really great for as post-bar food stop.

The bottom line here is: If you are interested in weird shit on your pizza, if you want a quick meal with zero frills or if you are more than a little tipsy, check this place out."}
{"text":"Used to come here when I visited for holidays, holidays meaning Halloween, and unofficial (st pattys) during my college years! The place would be packed you would have to make ur way across the ocean of paper plates. This spot is not just drunk food, its genuinely good! What makes this place stand out is their lage selection of pizzas with all sorts of toppings. Wish there were more places like this!"}
{"text":"Just ordered catering from Antonio's yesterday and it was outstanding! Everyone raved about how delicious food was and the price was great! You get alot of food for your money. Delivery was right on time, great service. Will always use Antonio's to cater our parties."}
{"text":"Honestly, I cannot recommend Antonio's to anyone over other available options. 

I have visited on two occasions. The first time I ordered pizza, the second time I ordered wings.  

Antonio's carries several interesting special pizzas. Being a by-the-slice place, it's understandable that the pizza isn't exactly fresh out of the oven. But here, the pizza goes through an intricate reheating process that makes you wonder how long it's been out. The machine is good at what it does, and I wish i had my own, as I don't typically eat leftover pizza. Still, makes me wonder.

Wing wise, the chicken was really good quality, but lacked a on the sauce. To put this in perspective, I enjoyed 57 North wings more. 

Bottom line, Antonio's isn't bad, but with Pizza Hut and Wing-n-Out down the street, there are better options out there."}
{"text":"Looking for a good pizza?! This is the BEST!! My favorite pizza place in Cleveland. The ingredients are fresh, and the breadsticks are amazing. I'm glad I live in Lakewood otherwise I would be here everyday! So good!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a few slices of Antonio's after a bar. Not bad prices and its never let me down."}
{"text":"Placed an order for a large deluxe from this location on Chevrolet Blvd and was told 30 to 35 minutes since I was coming from work and wanted the food to be fresh I placed another order for a salad from  the Antonio's at Parma what could go wrong I timed the orders. The salad from Antonio's in Parma was done on time and the pizza from Antonio's on Chevrolet was about an hour and 15 minutes and when I got home it was not cooked all the way through. Since it took so long of course my Antipasto salad was hot and unappealing since it sat in the car in 80 plus degrees. I called and asked to speak to a manager and spoke to Trevor .Trevor had me drive all the way back-to the store to refund me the money that I spent when I got there he gave me a slip stating that he refunded the money .He told a worker to throw out a pizza and walked away, unconcerned that I was out the cost of the salad he didn't even say sorry he just walked away.  Uncooked dough then double the told time and an uncaring manager I do not recommend eating from this place try another location."}
{"text":"This place is great for a slice (or 3) on the run.  They have lots of crazy combos.  My only complaint is that it is somewhat of a tease to look at the menu since some of the more interesting sounding pizzas do not come in slices."}
{"text":"College food. Cheap, decent for the price, lots of interesting pizza toppings ready to go. I like the chicken and pineapple."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and the price was right!  Stopped in for the lunch special, $5 for two slices with a drink and was not disappointed. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. Great service and friendly people. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Precursor: I now completely believe Cleveland makes the worst pizza.

Antonios breadsticks and sauce is spot on delicious. Toppings and cheese, plentiful and fresh.

Our delivery came piping hot to our hotel room. Raw dough. Translucent, dough ball rolling ability, raw.

Got our money back after a manager couldn't tell us if that was their standard way of making pizza or not. Either way, yuck. No raw dough pizza for me."}
{"text":"Best slices on campus. The Syracuse is amazing and the Mac n cheese pizza is wonderful. All kinds of pizza for all kinds of pizza lovers."}
{"text":"I have only had the pizza via delivery, so I can't speak to the actual store.

The pizza is great.  Toppings fresh and a lot of cheese.  Make sure you get the sausage because the hunks of meat are enormous and delicious.

Definitely would recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Antonio's and I wasn't as pleased as I thought I would be. For starters the wait time was one hour which is a while long but I do understand because I know that places get busy. Once the pizza finally arrived I was excited to dig in. I opened the box and my first impression was that there were generous amounts of toppings but the pizza slices were unevenly cut and paper underneath was sloppy and crinkled. I  then went to bite into the pizza and the dough was completely undercooked. Dough was very mushy, pizza sauce was kinda bland, and I was extremely displeased. I also ordered boneless wings with their original BBQ sauce which were very delicious but going back to the cooking time aspect, if you like them crispy they were not crispy to the slightest degree.. Sauce was delicious though. Maybe this was just a bad first impression but I was not satisfied with my experience.. Besides the wings.. The wing sauce was bangin'."}
{"text":"Once again, thanks to Yelp, I have found an excellent tasting local pizza restaurant that delivers. Food was promptly delivered. Pizza was perfect & delicious. Ordered hot wings. They were great but never hot enough for me. At least they did have a light kick. I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Stopped at Antonio's after leaving Carolina Rebellion. Hot, tired, and thirsty. Perfect place!  The owner met us as we came in, welcomed us, and then proceeded to serve some of the best Eggplant Parm I've ever had. Husband had Victoria's pasta, one of the four specialty pastas named for the owner's daughters.  Very good!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"They have a variety of slices and a frequent slice card!  Buy 11 slices and the 12th one is on them.  And you could eat for under $5 (slice and a coke)

KYLE rocks! He is super friendly, and is always willing to tell you what is on the slices or what he recommends! Arturo is friendly too!

P.S.
Grew up with NY slices so
I think Papa Del's is overrated, and the wait there is ridiculous.."}
{"text":"We had Antonio's catered for our daughters graduation party on August 2nd 2015. The food was excellent!  We had the several different menu items and while everything was very good, the lasagna was absolutely delicious and a definite favorite!  The only issue we had was there wasn't any serving spoons with the food when it was delivered so we had to run out and buy some really quick (that was a bit of an inconvenience). Overall though, we would cater from Antonio's again and would highly recommend them for any special event."}
{"text":"Quality pizza for a good price. I come here almost exclusively for the $5, 2 slices and a drink deal. The pizza is always delicious and they don't skimp on size either. Two of these slices are large enough to fill this starving college student up. The owner is nice and recently threw in some free garlic knots for my girlfriend and I. They also have fountain drinks now as well too."}
{"text":"Love Antonios as they have the best pizza on the west side. Tasty and great choices. In addition, there new app makes it easy to order. Timely delivery and u can track your order."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in the city.  I just moved back to the area, and was surprised to see they had a carry-out location near my house."}
{"text":"Ummmmm, can we say BEST AUTHENTIC PESTO I have had in a loooonnngg time ??! Whoa!? I don't eat meat so it's pretty easy to find veggie pizzas that satisfy.. but uhhhhhh.... THE PESTO VEGGIE PIZZA IS AMAZING !!! (I added mushrooms & loads of dried red pepper because I put that **** on everything!) My coworker/close friend & I got a small pizza 1 day for lunch & were SOOOOOO happy we did! We'll never be ordering chain pizza for the office EVER AGAIN!! Haven't had anything else off the menu but, honestly, don't think I need to!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Holiday Inn Strongsville.  I travel a lot for work, and, every now and then, I like to get in my PJs and order in.  I use YELP exclusively when I travel to determine where I will spend my employers  money. . Antonio's had the most stars and PICTURES of their product so I called in the order.  I opted for a small Sicilian with Sausage ( I have always wanted to say this in a review- Huge Sausage!) Pepperoni and some scorching hot Hungarian Peppers.  A small has 6 pieces. You can definetly split it. I love this pizza.  Thick chewy and crunchy crust.  Impressive Sausage.  Check out picture. Kinda like a sausage meatball.  Order it. I also got some Zappolis (little donuts coated with sugar.). Serving is enough for 5 people!!! And they could use some dipping sauce. Tasty though. Perfect pajama food."}
{"text":"I only go to this place once and it was a take away pizza. I ordered the bbq chicken peperoni pizza from yelp and picked it up. The atmosphere there was actually quite good, but the pizza itself is a bit dissapointing. Maybe I just ordered the wrong pizza. Will update if I changed my mind."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend ordered a large deep dish last night and although it was delicious the size of the pizza was quite disappointing. It looked like a small. But the garlic butter was really good and so were the cookies."}
{"text":"Did the clouds part spewing forth beams of light accompanied by angelic voices? No. Did it change my outlook on life and cause me to once again believe in the inherent goodness of mankind? Not even close. Was it good pizza? Yup. They've got 9 locations so they must be doing something right. This was a take-out order so my experience with the actual restaurant was brief (it seemed tiny, though). I'll keep focused on the chow.

I've had a lot of pizza from a lot of different pizza joints so I'd consider myself very well-versed in the subject. I know what I like - thick, doughy crust with a crispy crunch and just enough burnt cheese; slightly sweet sauce spiced with the usual Italian herbs, and the basic toppings. I'm a bit of a pizza purist and I'll make no apologies. This night it was to be the Sicilian square pizza, pepperoni, mushroom, banana peppers. Nothing else. The accompaniments? The garden salad and some fried dough bites.

The pizza was tasty, there's no arguing it. The six square pieces were covered evenly with the toppings and a nice caramelized surfaced greeted us upon opening. Fresh toppings? Nope. These are definitely of the jarred variety. Not a slam, just an observation. I grew up on canned mushrooms so I personally don't mind them. The crust was just what I was looking for. It was thick, buttery, with a crunchy outside and chewy, glutenous interior.

The salad was just what you'd expect from a pizza joint. iceberg lettuce, red onion, a few cherry tomatoes,tons of buttery croutons and a few slices of cuke. Straight outta the pizza joint salad playbook. The serving container, built more for a sub sandwich than a salad, was annoying. Minor, yes, but still.

The fried dough bites were just that, little bites of pizza dough fried and coated in sugar and cinnamon. Reminded me a bit of the elephant ears you get a the fair. Nothing special and probably not worth the calories but the wife placed the order and these came along for the ride.

I think that most of the five-star reviews of this place seem to be tied to some deep-rooted, childhood memories. The kind of memories that always seems to elevate even the most mundane to almost mythic levels. I've got plenty of them, too. Objectively, Antonio's has a well-made pizza. This was the first time I've had it and I thought it was good just not great. I might get it again sometime but given how many pizza places I've yet to try it might be awhile."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza while we were visiting relatives in Rocky River over the holidays. It was excellent pizza! We were very impressed...crust was perfect and it was loaded with toppings! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for a competition. Looked around for a reasonable place to eat. Antonio's pizza was chosen. Staff was great and the pizza and salad were made to perfection. Highly recommend this establishment for a pizza."}
{"text":"Wings were very taste. Not dry and the sauces were very good. But the wings were on the small side and the way they delivered them means they are hard to plate with out getting sauce every where. But over all I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"I tried Antonio's when it first opened back up, and it was AMAZING! Pizza was hot, fresh, and so good! Pepperoni and Sausage are staples, but they also have daily specials, which are hit or miss. Sadly, over time, the place seems to have gotten weaker. The pizza just doesn't seem to taste the same, as if every slice I've gotten for a while has been made for at least a few hours. :(

If you want to drink water, there is a table by the register with a dispenser (like the kind you would see at a football game) and small plastic cups.

Staff there has always been super friendly and nice, probably their strong suit."}
{"text":"I have to get Antonio's every time I'm in town because Dayton pizza is terrible. By far the best pizza in Cleve!"}
{"text":"Now if you had told me before Antonio's opened that there was going to be a pizza by the slice place on Green Street, I know I would have said \"you know it is going to be garbage that only the drunk kids coming out of the bars will eat.\" I was so happy that Antonio's proved me flat out wrong. They make some of the best gourmet pizzas that I have ever had with topping combinations that I would never have thought of. Potato on a pizza!? Hell yeah! Antonio's rules, and for the price, I don't think you can find a better deal close to campus."}
{"text":"ANTONIO'S is back!!!

I loved getting pizza here after a night of fun on Green St. and the bars. Antonio's is the place to go for a delicious quick slice of New York-styled pizza and the price is good. There's a lot of variety in the choices of toppings/slices.

I'm a fan of the staff working there too."}
{"text":"Everytime I swing by to grab a quick bite, or maybe sit down for dinner. I'm always met with smiles, and a welcoming atmosphere.
Last night I had 2 slices and decided to enjoy some wings. They are definitely market fresh, and are phenomi-nom-nominal get the HOT wings, they aren't crazy strong like east coast wings. So if you like big juicy wings, get me while they're made by a pro."}
{"text":"Average pizza place though better than the choices nearby. They serve thin crust pizza that is always soggy. I can never have the same slice twice, so I've tried a lot of toppings. I conclude that their best one is the Caprese. They use huge, fresh basil leaves and actual rounds of mozzarella, like it should be. The portions are large."}
{"text":"Good place for pick up or delivery.  Not much of a dining room though.  The pizza was good and our kids loved the pizza nuggets.  Thick crust pizza with a sweet red sauce."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza place for lunch.  They sell pizza by the slice and tons of it.  The slices are huge, two is definitely too much food for me.  My favorites are the Eggplant Parmesan, the potato and the Tomato Basil with fresh Mozzarella.  The selection of vegetarian pizzas they serve is amazing. True the Sicilian that everyone loves is greasy, but the normal crust vegetarian pizzas are rarely greasy at all.  The average price for a slice in 2.50 to 3.50 I think, I usually ate there for $5.  Great place to run in and grab a slice to go before class."}
{"text":"Wow, been three years since my last review...

Quality, on some things, has gone downhill. The wings are now on par with Marco's, which means tiny and mushy. The half sheet we got was not fully cooked, as evidenced by a grey line in the crust. Probably a good idea to order it well done.  Italian sub was nothing special.

Now, the casata cake is worth every cent of the $4.25 they charge. It was gigantic and excellent.

I have to give praise for their online ordering system. This is what all the competitors should be like. 

Overall, we may or may not order again. Parma does have about 3 million pizza places..."}
{"text":"Antonio's wasn't around when I lived in this area, and it's too bad because it's sooooooo good! My brother had been raving about their pizza, so I figured I'd check it out since I'm in town for the week. We ordered a chicken, spinach, and Alfredo pizza and a pepperoni and sausage pizza. First of all, this wasn't just regular old pepperoni and sausage. It was \"old world\" pepperoni - the really small, thick, amazing little pepperonis. And the sausage was amazing. The red sauce, omg. Perfection. And love the crust. The Alfredo pizza, again, had a great sauce and crust. My only complaint is that the pepperoni and sausage pizza is really greasy. Like, dab it with a paper towel greasy. But overall, this has to be one of the best pizza joints in the area, hands down."}
{"text":"It's amazing how much variety Antonio's has in their pizza.  I usually get a slice of avocado enchilada and a slice of buffalo chicken.  The people working are generally quite nice, and the food is cheap and delicious.  Once they didn't have any avocado enchilada, so they made it for me on a slice of cheese-- they were so accommodating, it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Apparently I keep forgetting that I have already tried this place so here is my review so I remember not to make another visit. It's not that the food is bad, not at all, it's just \"meh, I've experienced better\". It's forgettable. I think I have been here 2 or 3 times in the last three years? I forget about my experience and get suckered in when I finally fall for one of their mail advertisements. 

*1 lbs of mild wings $8.99 - The menu describes these as \"Jumbo Wings\", but they are on the smaller end of average size. Nothing special and it's an extra .35¢ if you want blue cheese dressing to go with your wings. 
*Small Spinach and Artichoke Dip Pizza $10.49 - You'd expect a dip to be thick, creamy, cheesy, but this pizza did not really have that. Just a regular layer of sauce and cheese with artichokes on it. 

Again, the food is not bad, but it is mediocre. No issue with the staff. Place seems clean. Prices aren't outrageous. I just think there are better pizza places out there (Angelo's, Danny Boy's, Edison's, Samosky's, even Jet's is better). Sorry Antonio's."}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to the folks who were working here on a recent weekday night when my family decided to stop in and eat on premises.  Although they have tables and chairs set up in their waiting area, we didn't think they were accustomed to having people actually eat in the store.  However, that was our only option at that point, and they were happy to oblige.  No complaints about the hospitality or service!

As for the pizza, it was good, but as a former east-sider, I've had better.  I would certainly order from Antonio's again (and we're curious about their fried chicken), but I'll continue to be on the lookout for our new pizza joint.  If Antonio's ends up being that place, I won't complain."}
{"text":"As a loyal customer of the original Antonio's I was anxious to get some good old Western Mass Pizza and made a pilgrimage to Champaign only to discover that the resturant had been closed by the department of Health in February. There's no mention of this on the website and the phone message box is full. What's going on?"}
{"text":"Antonio's is my go-to pizza for delivery. It's a bit on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for. Good sauce, good toppings. What you would expect from a higher-end pizza place."}
{"text":"This was our \"go to\" place for pizza for years even though the service was always slow and incompetent....at least the food was consistently good. Unfortunately, the last few times I've ordered pizza from them it has been good at best and mediocre the last two times. Tonight the pepperoni pizza had completely soggy crust...and it had just come out of the oven. We were also given the wrong salads. Instead of complaining again I am just switching to another pizza joint. It's not like there's a shortage of them in the area.
,"}
{"text":"I'm from California, and whenever I'm in Parma to visit family (of which four generations have lived here), we inevitably have a pizza night and it's always from Antonio's...and it's always great! Yeah, with the abundance of other pizza joints in the area, there very well might be better options, but still, I'm always happy to gulp down a few slices from Antonio's!"}
{"text":"We order the special they had a Large pizza, 2 toppings & 1 dozen of hot buffalo wings. I really like the pizza when it was hot & the pizza bread was awesome & crunchy. Good portion of cheese & sauce. The crust was good too. The wings were ok but they were mildly hot. If you like garlic rolls like me, oh My, these are so Good! I like the marinara sauce because it doesn't overpower the bread. These rolls are amazing. Altogether it's soft, crunchy, I'm drooling, and not at all garlic burnt tasting. 
The reviews looked great I wanted to really like the pizza here & adopt as my pizza place. Oh well I want more g rolls"}
{"text":"We received a gift card to go Antonio's Pizza.... Looked up the website and thought we could go to a pizza place.....no..... It's a carry out- but if you go next door to Tony Malonies you can get the same pizza but sit at the bar and eat it. 
We had Danielle as our server and was probably the best part of the experience.She went thru a list of the bar cocktails and beers and we ended up with a Jose Cuervo Margarita and a Moscow Mule. Then we ordered a pizza. Now my husband and I have been to Italy a few times and were expecting some type of Italian pizza- something close to our travels from the toe of Italy to the top. 
We ordered the Thin crust, regular sauce, ham and mushrooms. The crust was good, and the sauce had a lot of flavor.. but why oh why do pizza places use canned mushrooms,they become yellowish green and soft when baked. The ham had a great taste if it was on a salad. Big chunks...but again on a pizza? Maybe a thing slice / shaved ham would have been better. Not sure if we will go back- if we do it will be because we have money left on the card and we can already get a cocktail from Danielle."}
{"text":"Pizza is very tasteful and the have beef pepperoni as a topping option!!! The wings are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Okay. To start off with, this is an amazing place for college students. It's right off Green street, a couple minute walk off campus, and the place is open late with cheap, to-go pizza by the slice. First of all, it's rare to find pizza by the slice nowadays (back when I was in college, I had to buy pizzas whole or just find another food option) and Antonio's Pizza, with its large slices and diversity of toppings/combinations, is almost too perfect. 
4 stars because I got some...interesting...slices that were completely my fault because I hate ranch (idk why but I thought a buffalo wings and ranch pizza was a hawaiian chicken pizza what is wrong with me haha). If I ever come here again, I'll definitely be trying some safer options (like sausage and cheese)!"}
{"text":"Worst Delivery and Service in the history of pizza.  if you must get, be sure to pick it up yourself.  Better off try somewhere else"}
{"text":"I have been going to Antonio's for over 20yrs starting with their original dine-in location. I love this pizza (or did) and I'm at my final time with this location for sure. I'm not sure if it's Tony Maloneys being connected that makes their quality subpar, but I kept giving them a shot for some reason until now. 

The wife and I ordered the Sicilian square and the pesto thin crust. They were nearly the same thickness and the Sicilian was dripping with grease. I have a lot of good pizza places around so I'm done with Antonio's unfortunately now. With all their locations popping up everywhere, maybe they got big too fast or something."}
{"text":"Antonio's pizza offers the best lunch deal. For around five dollars you get a nice big slice of pizza of your choice, a salad with dressing, and a pop. I've gone there more than several times and I love the convenience and the food!"}
{"text":"Visited this location not for pizza but for the Special Salad. I used to order this salad at the Parmatown location back in the 80s. The dressing is the same sweet oil and vinegar but remember more pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Still, I enjoyed it. I also ordered Freddie's cheese bread with garlic sauce. Because it was Thursday and I ordered online, cheese bread was 50%. It was very good. 
I would suggest that the counter staff learn about customer service.  No thank you for the tip that I gave when I picked up my order. Maybe you can't teach manners."}
{"text":"Love Antonio's Pizza! Delicious pizza with many varieties to choose from. Also they know a thing or two about service. Of all the times I ordered from there, I had one with poor service where the operator messed up our pizza order. They fixed it by delivering the right one and I got a letter in the mail later apologizing for the mix up. What a great place with great food and great service. I highly recommend the Veggie pizza- it's like no other."}
{"text":"Suprisingly good.  Hometown family does pizza well.  Also their fried chicken is great.  They cook it fresh so when u call tell them no so salty.  Sometimes the chciken comes out salty.  But it still great."}
{"text":"We just ordered the chicken Parmesan with cheese ravioli. It was fantastic.  I highly recommend it.  We have also ordered their pizza.  It is also wonderful. If you haven't tried it you should."}
{"text":"So I grew up on this stuff....Antonio's Pizza.  I loved this stuff before Drew Carey gave it his seal of approval.  
 It all started in a little Italian family restaurant in \"Snowville\" in Parma for me.  They moved across the street and expanded quite a bit.  This was the place my family went as a kid, it was the place we Holy Namers always went after our high school games.  It is where I go now for CONSISTENTLY Great Memories and great pizza.
 First off, I must clarify my review is based pretty 90% on their pizza...sure they have other stuff, but is it great?  Some yes (try for one Muffalatta) others no (say salad, always been white iceberg less than appealing, however their grated mozzarella and pepper is a good cover up)
 I can describe their pizza and what makes it so good....For me it's always a deluxe....GREAT freshly baked pizza dough and perfectly crunchy to bite yet soft to chew crust...A well done sauce, and great toppings.  I always to opt for Extra cheese.  No pizza place anywhere ever gives you enough cheese on any pizza.  Fresh pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions finish quite well.  Soft chewy warm.  Dough you can taste and that tastes good.  This is fantastic.  From time to time I will get one of the other types of pizzas but the deluxe is by far my favorite.  Fresh ingredients (except for mushrooms) make this excellent.
 Another of their lesser known treats is their Chicago Deep Dish.  Not many places can pull it off like Antonio's; even the Chicagoans have forgotten what a pizza PIE is.  
 Overall to sum it up, this has been my lifetime favorite.  In fact it's the pizza I compare all pizzas too.  Thank you to the LoSchiavo family for your great product!"}

{"text":"I will start this off by saying I love Antonios Pizza in general, with that being said, some of the locations such as this one fail to meet the standard that is delivered at say their Parmatown location.  When I first wrote my review I failed to realize this.  Since then the quality at this particular Antonios has been so bad I stopped being a patron.  I called to complain and was supposed to be added to the coupon list and never was.  I ordered twice since then. Prior to tonight, I had not ordered from there for the better part of a year however tonight I got the itched for a Deep Dish. Once again this location failed to deliver.  The food arrived and appeared to be warm however mushrooms and onions were not fully cooked and were chewy.  Its not worth complaining anymore, so now I just update my original yelp.  5 stars? what was I thinking? no way!"}
{"text":"Before you see the 3 stars this isn't because the pizza is bad. Antonio's is actually my new favorite pizza place. We order from them once a week or so. But for some reason the last 2 times we have gotten pies from them they just aren't cooked all the way. We got a veggie pizza and the middle was raw. I called to let them know and they sent out a new pizza. The following week we ordered a bruschetta pizza once again it was raw in the middle. And the potato pizza was room temp at best. I didn't call this time. I really love their pizza. I just wish they could get it together. The potato skin pizza was great after I microwaved it. It needs a side of sour cream though. Maybe I will edit this later."}
{"text":"Pizza is almost always perfect. 

Salad is delicious

The guys are always friendly. 

We will miss this place when we move to NoRo"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time. Got the veggie and it was nice except the broccoli on it was wilted and gross. Took off one star for that.
The spinach and artichoke dip pizza was simply amazing!!
I don't know why it took over an hour too get our order. One more star off.
By the time we got it was cooled alot.
Still the artichoke pizza was phenomenal and I will order again.
I'll just pick it up!!!"}
{"text":"Prettttty sure this place knows my family.

Honestly, I have had zero complaints. The pizza is awesome, the nuggets are outstanding and they even have bomb salads! (See pic)"}
{"text":"Very hit or miss. Sometimes it hits the spot because just the right amount of greasiness. But more often than not, just way too greasy without any real delicious pay off. I'd rather walk a little further to dragon fire pizza truck than eat here."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Illinois just south of Chicago. I grew up on deep dish pizza...it pains me that I've been unable to find a good deep dish pizza here in Cleveland! The closest I've found is here at Antonio's. I must admit, I've not been to the restaurant and have only ordered delivery...so I'll have to focus my review on just the pizza. It's not the same as Chicago Deep Dish (come on....what is???), but it's a dang good close second! It's a true \"pie\" and the one I got was baked to perfection. Do not be nervous about them only coming in medium...this is a true pizza pie and one piece is about the equivalent of 2 or 3 regular pieces, so it goes much much further. Nice deep dish option!"}
{"text":"First time review, but I found myself irked enough by this experience that I figured it was worth it.

Came in today during Engineering Open House and was impressed with the options. There are a lot of types of pizza, which is cool. Service was great, and they gave me a handy rundown when I informed them that I was new to the place.

Food was cheap, at $3.90 for a slice of mushroom and a medium soda, which is just about perfect.

However, I found myself disappointed by the pizza. Having lived in the area for years, I've simply had better. Not enough sauce, not enough cheese - it was just off. New York style pizza should be gooey and messy and very saucy. 

The other reason that I left a 2-star review is because the bathroom was appallingly gross. There was water next to the floor drain, and no soap in the soap dispenser - especially unfortunate because the bathroom itself was just gross. 

I don't usually say this about restaurants because I can usually pick pretty well, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"been getting their pizza for years, it is very good but lately noticed they are a little heavy handed with the sauce and skimpy on the cheese, called once a while back and the manager said that the new cheese they are using must have a little more moisture content in it....gee, heard that from places that are cutting corners........anyway the pizza is good quality but now i order extra cheese, to get a normal amount....their sicilian square is good, why aren't they sprinkling a little corn meal on all their pizza, why just the square?  Been cheating on them and getting Marco's White Pizza (loaded with three or four cheeses, bacon bits and tomatoes) and sprinkled with a little cornmeal, it is the bomb.  Now we order from both places, depending on our mood."}
{"text":"Great pizza slices at affordable prices! The owner is super friendly, as well as everyone else who work here. Antonio's is located on Green St in the heart of campustown and it's open super late. Every time I go here, I try different slices -- there's a lot of variety to choose from. And every once in a while they have deals on Hooked; keep an eye out for those."}
{"text":"If you're at the U of I and want a slice of pizza, go here. If you've been drinking, it only makes it better. The line always looks huge at night but they serve everyone really fast. Every now and then the cashier will give a free drink to someone for no real reason at all. Everyone can find a reason to love Antonio's. 

All in all, Antonio's is amazing- if you're on green street, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Pizza is always really good!  I heard delivery is slow but I get off of my butt to get my food!   Their Gourmet Nugget rolls regardless of which type you get are tremendous."}
{"text":"Really poor experience. The cavatelli were undercooked and the sauce no flavor to it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza delivery a few times from Antonio's and I haven't been disappointed yet! Lots of specialty pizzas that you don't see anywhere else. 

4 stars because I did have some trouble ordering online, though. Had to call in"}
{"text":"Unless they've changed it, you can get a huge slice of pizza and a drink for $5.  Pretty sweet deal.  They have a huge variety (although they dont always have their large variety available).  My favorite though is white pizza.  Delicious.. I could totally go for one now.  They serve you pretty fast also, as they are used to impatient drunk kids at 2am.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"Glad this place is back. It's not QUITE as tasty as I remember, but still has an awesome spread of unique flavors. I will still stop in from time to time."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this place for ages--I have no bad things to say about Antonio's pizza. I've been a stranded New England native, fond of Boston and New York style pies, and for three long years, I was deprived, forced to eat those soups-in-bread-bowls called deep dish pizzas. Antonio's answers this with some DELICIOUS, well-priced thin crust pizza. The toppings are creative, the diameters huge, and the cheese a perfect, supple mozzarella. The staff is so friendly and the food so worth it that you'd be a fool to skip Antonio's."}
{"text":"Best NY Style Pizza in Charlotte, NC in The University area. Tried two pepperoni / sausage slices well done. Great flour, fresh cheese and delicious home made pizza sauce."}
{"text":"Have been going here on/off for many years, still taste as great since I've started, eggnog with my family love the specials wee usually get the large pepperoni pizza & large salad combo can't beat that for $20.99 can't forget the garlic cheese bread, thou can really taste the freshness in their product, keep up the great job..."}
{"text":"I live nearby and this is my go to pizza place. I've never been a fan of the dimpled crust pizza so I usually stay away from that. However, The Sicilian squares are, hands down, the best pizza in the area. The pizza crust is more spongy with a nice crispy buttery texture. Flavorful! It is a must try if you haven't yet.

Usual order: Large Sicilian Square (Whole: Extra Cheese, light sauce, 1/2: pineapple, 1/2: pepperoni, sausage & mushrooms). 

I am actually placing an order now for delivery tomorrow to surprise the wife with my return home. I will also be adding pictures of the Sicilian Square when I receive my pizza tomorrow. Make it a pretty Anotonio's!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and my wife and I are exploring all our new pizza opportunities.

I ordered calzone; pepperoni and black olives.  Dough was good and the topping amount was appropriate.  Big knock = no ricotta in the calzone.  That is a cardinal sin for a calzone.  Without the ricotta, I would recommend ordering extra cheese in your calzone.

Also got an order of hot wings and asked for extra crispy.  As a Buffalonian in exile I have high standards for wings.  I ordered \"1 pound\" of wings which totaled 8 wings... The sauce was good, could have been hotter but it was a traditional buffalo type sauce, so good marks there.  Issues here were the wing size and the crispiness.  These were far from big enough chicken wings; a .  8 small wings for 9 dollars?  Bad deal.  For a great traditional wing you need a great crispy skin.  Even though I asked for extra crispy wings, these still came out of the fryer 45 seconds to a minute too soon.

My wife also ordered a small supreme pizza.  By far the best item we got.  The crust was good; thick enough to support the toppings and it was baked well.  The toppings were arranged thoughtfully and there was even a large crumble of sausage on each piece!  Good, but not good enough for me to crave in the future."}
{"text":"So... I'm just going to come out and say it... this was a sub par pizza experience. This is at least the #4 pizza by taste on the west side, possibly lower. I'd put it around Papa Johns quality. On a positive note, the warm red dipping sauce was good. 

The other stuff: The small was tiny, the pizza and cheese bread wasn't cut equally.  

Bottom line - I'm not going to turn down a slice, but I'm not going to be going back on my own time. It's a short ride from here to pizza by Robert, and I'll probably make it from here on."}
{"text":"Antonio's is a good deal.  I don't go here too often for lunch or dinner because I try to be more healthy with my food options.  For me.. it's not quite enough for me to eat one slice.. but two slices is too much.  But definetely a great place to go when you're hungry and been out drinking all night.  Great drunk food.. that's affordable.  But the place is packed then.

The Beef Taco pizza is delicious.. and so is their potato bacon pizza.  

Not crazy about the lack of decor... or the fact that their water comes from a plastic water tank."}
{"text":"The pizza is good.  Just don't expect to get your order correct.  Three pizzas in a row the order was incorrect."}
{"text":"I got the Victoria's Tortellini. Very big portion. It's for sure that it's not the best I have had and it doesn't taste like a small $20 pasta dish at some Italian restaurants but it's really worth the money and quite delicious for a dish that costs $11."}
{"text":"When I first moved to the area, my co-worker said I had to try Antonio's and I'm so glad I did. Every time I order from here I fall more in love with pizza! And they've always been 10-15 minutes faster than estimated time. I highly recommend to anyone looking for delicious pizza, wings, breadsticks, or salad. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!  FINALLY, after 18 years of searching (since I moved here), and mostly dissapointment along the way, I have quite possibly found the BEST FRIGGIN' PIZZA in the Cleveland metro area!  Antonio's SICILIAN SQUARE STYLE PIZZA!  Absolutely WORLD CLASS!   This self-avowed 'pizza snob', having sampled some of the best pizza's in the NYC and NJ area, is AGOG for this fantastic tasting pizza!  The tasty crust is perfect-  thick, airy, and crispy in all the right places.  The stringy cheese and aromatic sauce tastes fresh and perfectly balanced.  This, my friends is pizza DONE RIGHT!   It's hard to believe that this is delivery pizza!  Clearly, the LoSchiavo family knows how to make a PROPER pizza!  The pizza box has the following quote on it:  \"Delivering Old World Quality.\"  INDEED!

UPDATE:  Damn.  I don't get it.  I enthusiastically ordered this pizza again, and this time it did not taste nearly as great.  But it was still good.  My guess is that the cheese and crust were more well done (browned) the first time around, whereas this time it may have been undercooked, with a much softer crust.  My 5 star rating remains though, because I know what Antonio's is capable of.  Incidentally, they screwed up my order by giving me 2 pepperoni squares, when I ordered 1 pepperoni, 1 plain (large Sicilian pie).

LATEST UPDATE:  OK!  I ordered their Sicilian square style pizza once again, remembering how great it was the first time, and BINGO-  it was fantastic!  It tasted just as superb as the first time I discovered Antonio's, and initially ordered their Sicilian pizza, upon which my original review was done!  To the LoSchiavos:  clearly, the final great taste of this Sicilian style pizza depends on COOKING IT properly, until the crust and cheese browns up a bit!  As long as you do not undercook this pizza, it's a masterpiece!  DO NOT change the ingredients one iota!  This is one of the 3 best pizzas i've had in NE Ohio in my 18 years living here, hands down!  The other 2 being Carabba's stone oven baked pizza, and Fragapane's Deli Sicilian style squares!"}
{"text":"Every year, I take as many T.I.S. coupon books as I can, tear out all of the Antonio's buy on get one free's, and stash them in my room. Haha, sorry roomie! It's just THAT good. 

Quick service, free delivery, hilaaarious staff. Don't leave campus without stopping into Antonio's."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and a Greek salad yesterday during the nasty cold winter we started to have. They told me it might take longer than usual due to high orders but it was only about 40 minutes. My Greek salad was large and flavorful. I ordered a white pizza with spinach and Roma tomatoes. It was light, fluffy, and super tasty, I will for sure order it again. Very pleased overall for pizza delivery, something I don't typically get because they all end up just tasting like fast food to me, but this one was legit, a little pricy for what it was, but worth it."}
{"text":"Their food is wonderful, but delivery is awful, even when you schedule it days in advance. Keep blaming it on \"issues with delivery staff\". Then hire new people!
Also, twice when I did pick up my food, they got the order wrong! No apologies, either!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are always excellent!  But the menu on yelp needs to be updated!  I was looking forward to some of the dinners that are no longer offered at the Snow Rd location. Very disappointing. And why are you charging for cheese on a meatball sub?  REALLY?!? That should be standard."}
{"text":"I expect better from Antonio's.  The calzone that I had ordered was drier than I am used to.  there was no sauce IN the calzone, and I had asked for extra sauce with it.  I only received the one container that should come with a calzone to begin with.  I have ordered from there before, and it has been great food.  Something or someone has changed, and it shows - not for the better."}
{"text":"We went looking through yelp and wanted the best pizza in Cleveland.  We found very good pizza but not perfect.  The bread sticks were the best part.  The sauce is made from scratch.  The decor for sit in is exactly like olive garden, which is a bit weird but clean.  The crust is delicious!  

The only thing I would complain about is that the bbq sauce on the bbq chicken pizza tastes just like kraft.  There is no way that that one is home made, and there is way too much of it on the pizza.  Everything else was yummy! I will be making this my main pizza place from now on.  It's minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Very inexpensive pizza.  $14 for two Large pizzas (16 inch!)  Was fast and a very excellent tasting East coast pizza.  (New York Style).  Would definitely go here again.  Not sure how eating in is, but the inside is really small and it seems they only offer slices of a few types of pizza.  

Only downside was that one of our pizzas was barely cooked.  We threw it in the oven for a few minutes though once we got home and it was as good as ever.  All and all, really delicious pizza for very cheap prices!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid option for Italian cuisine if you are in the area. Great for lunch time, with plenty to choose from. I recommend their subs and sandwiches. All of there food is made with fresh ingredients, and they treat all their customers with respect and the welcoming vibe they deserve."}
{"text":"Take your taste buds for a walk in the windy city. Antonio's \"Deep Dish\" pizza will have your taste buds thinking you just landed in Chicago. From the ground up this magnificent pizza pie is built for tasteful perfection. Upon picking up my order, I was disappointed when discovering that the size of this medium pizza was looking more like a small. Big Boys don't like wimp sized pizzas. When it comes to this little guy, I say don't judge a pizza by its box. This Deep Dish delivers and with it's thick crust it packs a punch that will fill the gut. You won't finish it alone but would be a fool to share because it's that good."}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed stumbling drunkenly into Antonio's for that/those ~2am slice(s).

We came from Red Lion and during the summer there was hardly anyone in the place. Not good for people such as myself who can never decide what to get!

My roommate and I opted to each try the spinach & feta which was surprisingly tasty. I'd highly recommend it.

My other go-to is the mac & cheese which time and time again exceeds drunken expectations and leaves the consumer nice and carb-ed up.

Still good, even in the summer."}
{"text":"I love the creative pizza options this place comes up with!  One time I had a chicken burrito pizza.  Sounds terrifying, right?  Somehow, it was magical.  I'm a little underwhelmed by their \"regular\" pizza toppings, though.  The whole point is to try something inventive, so take chances!  

Also, I wish the slices weren't sitting under a heat lamp for hours, but that's pizza-by-the-slice for you.  Oh well, it still tastes good."}
{"text":"I came here for a pasta hankering and a desire to stay on budget. As usualYelp led the way. I've driven by this place and this shopping center a million times but never stopped. 

When I arrived I was warmly greeted by the cashier.  I opted for the spaghetti marinara which comes with three garlic knots. After ten minutes, I was served a piping hot bowl of pasta swimming in marinara and three warm, pillowy garlic knots. It was a really solid, homemade marinara and the garlic knots had great flavor. 

The ambience is typical college town pizzeria but clean and tidy with spotless restrooms. 

It was a great cure to a spaghetti hankering and at $7.50 plus a student discount, it was certainly a great value. They have tons of other great pasta dishes on the menu and the pizza looked wonderful. They even offer BEEF PEPPERONI!!! 

I will certainly be back when a need for budget-friendly Italian arises."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised by Antonio's. I didn't think of Cleveland as a place that would have solid pizza. I ordered the deep dish with pepperoni, mushrooms and banana peppers. They know how to make a pie. It had great flavor and I loved the crust. I would definitely go back to Antonio's and I wouldn't mind trying their other pizzas as well."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza with the craziest toppings you've ever seen! This place always hits the spot, whether it's for lunch or at 2am after a night out. By the way, check out the TIS coupon books for the buy one get one free coupons! Hopefully they haven't stopped doing that."}
{"text":"What's really good about this place is that it's open late. The pizza slices are fairly large but they're meh. Essentially, the slices are pre-made and then warmed. Even though they put my pizza through their warmer, it was still cold. 

The whole pizzas come in two sizes: medium (12\") and large (16\"). Medium pizzas cost anywhere from $10 to $11.75. Large pizzas cost anywhere from $14.25 to $17.50."}
{"text":"I have tried the NEW Wadsworth, Ohio location twice and this place is excellent! The Portebello Palermo pizza is out of this world fantastic! This is one of the best ever and the crust has a different taste that just keeps us coming back for another.  I tell anyone and everyone they have to give this place a try at any of their \"family only\" owned locations!! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, affordable, and quick. Usually when I eat this kind of pizza the crust is super thin and the cheese isn't great, but all the dough is perfect thickness and I loved the cheese. The employees were all friendly and the atmosphere was very comfortable. I loved this place. Go there!!"}
{"text":"Just an awful experience. Watery pizza and no utensils. We were driving by after a soccer game looking to grab a slice on the way home. I bookmarked it to remember not to stop again, but I wouldn't expect it to be open for very long."}
{"text":"Descent pizza with good service. Cheese sticks are frozen not freshly made.  That's really the only complaint that I have. If you are looking for a good inexpensive pizza by the slice this is your spot"}
{"text":"Best pizza in a town with a lot of pizza already. Main cause of depression for nearby Papa John's and Domino's."}
{"text":"Epic win! They replaced a poor pizza spot with guys who really know what they are doing. The quality is incredible. Will be a regular customer"}
{"text":"Called 3 times, the guy hung up on me for the first 2 times. Then when I was able to speak, he was extremely rude and unprofessional. We then paid $40 for 2 specialty pizzas, each, the size of a dessert plate and 9 chicken wings that were soggy and the flavor is terrible. \"Real Italian Pizza\" MY ASS! I could make a better pizza with an Easy Bake Over and Nose drippings. Never ordering from this place again, and I'll be sure to spread the word of the atrocity that is Antonio's Za."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the best thin crust pizza in Champaign. It's comparable to Chicago style pizzas. They have a huge variety and it's very cheap. Restaurant is clean too."}
{"text":"There is no better pizza in town!! I love Antonio's pizza, any kind! Sometimes I will stop in here just to grab a salad, which is also phenomenal.  I highly recommend their house dressing.  It's the best, on a salad or to dip your pizza crust in :)"}
{"text":"I must first say Ive driven past this place hundreds of times and never ate here . It was wonderful the delivery driver accidentally took my pie and the nice lady had the gentleman in the back make me another on which only took 10 more minutes and offered me a salad which was excellent. The Italian dressing was great and the pizza awesome . I stand the sauce up with anything in little Italy and high quality cheese you can taste it . Crust just right not to thick . Kudos and thanks for the great meal Antonios!"}
{"text":"This review is for the catering service from this Antonio's location. Like the other Antonio's locations, they have a great catering menu in addition to their regular choices. I've ordered their party packages before for different events, and it's always a hit! 

I picked up a large order today for a friend's bridal shower luncheon at work. I was very impressed with not just the food but the super helpful and friendly employees! 

They have a great catering deal that includes a full tray of their Italian Salad (including 2 bottles of their housemade dressing and sliced pepperoni), 40 pieces of fried chicken, a full sheet pizza (which came in two half sheets, which was perfect!), and a full tray of rigatoni for $135. That is an excellent price for really good food! I would estimate that this particular package is enough for 20-40 people. I also ordered a half tray of their eggplant parmesan - it was AWESOME! 

All in all, I'm very happy with the order and easy location for pickup (even from downtown), and will definitely keep them in mind for future catering needs!"}
{"text":"Great option for after the bar snacking. Might even be legit for sober eating. Dirty seating area, but it was 3 am after the bars closed so that is pretty much part for the course."}
{"text":"Was relying on other reviews when I chose this restaurant and I was very disappointed. I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and sausage and a side of wings. I think the chicken wings were three days old , they definitely tasted like it. The pizza was mediocre at best with no distinctive  flavors what so ever. If this is the \"best pizza in Charlotte\" you definitely new pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is because the food is actually delicious! Should you by chance have it arrive in a timely manner and still be warm.

The first time we ordered from Antonio's it was 15 minutes later than the time they said it would arrive. I get it, not enough drivers, logistics...whatever. However when it happens EVERY TIME YOU ORDER just go somewhere else. There are plenty of pizza places in North Royalton/Broadview Heights that are just as good and are timely.

Currently they are 45 minutes late. I have called the restaurant to have them brush me off and say \"they'll be there.\" Who does that?"}
{"text":"I ordered deep dish pizza and was stuffed & satisfied. There used to be a place called Uno's in Cleveland that closed down a long time ago. Since then, I haven't been able to find deep dish pizza. I was immediately taken back to family dinners at that old pizza shop! The flavor of the sauce, the crispy crust, just the right amount of cheese and the flavorful Italian sausage.....MAN!

You can't put a price on great deep dish pizza, fond memories or a full belly!"}
{"text":"Our go-to for pizza delivery when we have coupons.  Pizza is great, wings are good for a pizza place, garlic bread is great too.  A solid Parma staple."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout twice here and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The crust was perfect and the sauce was plentiful and not too sweet. I believe they have seating inside, but it is clearly a pizza place you should deliver/carry out from because of the size. It shouldn't be a surprise to the previous reviewer that they don't have a restroom. I'll update if something slips in the service but so far Antonio's has my business!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery.  Took two hours to get our house.  Only to find out that they messed it up and forgot half of it.  Ridiculous.  Good quality when it finally arrived a total 3 hours later."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel outside of Detroit for work, I always enjoy trying new places to eat. Been in town for 2 1/2 weeks and wish I would have stopped in sooner! Ordered up a small spinach artichoke dip pizza and added chicken. WOW, AMAZING! You can definitely tell there's quality and freshness. Needless to say I'll be letting the rest of our crew know and will definitely have to try another pie before I leave. 

Almost forgot! The staff they had on around noon, were friendly, enthusiastic, and seem to really take pride in working at the establishment. That's becoming more and more rare these days. Kee up the great work!"}
{"text":"On 3-19-16 I called for a delivery order the guy was so nice and helpful I called at 530 pm so whoever was working deserves a raise !! You guys should be happy to have such great employee. I wish I would've gotten his name . And their food is amazing too."}
{"text":"When we looked at the menu and found some great unique pizzas, I was not expecting the hole-in-the-wall that was their store front. The pizzas were really good though! We brought them home for about 15 people and they were ready in less than 25 minutes. We had the potato skin w/ bacon, tri-pepperoni, portobello Sicilian, and half sheet cheese. Every thing was yummy, the crust on the round pizzas was not too dense and the Sicilian deep dish was Mmmm Mmmm! I would be very happy to have this as my local pizza joint. Try the specials!"}
{"text":"If Antonio's delivered, they would probably rule the world by now. Let me mention that I'm not reviewing this through a post-bar drunken point of view - I don't drink, and all my drunk buddies and sober me are drawn to this place like it has a tractor beam, as soon as 2am rolls around. We talk about how we can't wait to go to Antonio's in the afternoon before we get ready, as we're walking to the bars, and while we're at the bars.

I recommend the barbecue steak and bacon, although the steak has been tough for me once. There's also a steak and bacon ranch, subbing ranch for BBQ, obviously. Buffalo chicken bleu is spectacular, with lots of blue cheese and good vinegar hot sauce. The tortellini is good, but I've had the shells be undercooked before, and if they have the gyro pizza, you should not miss it. SOOOOO good. And it's $3 a slice for a massive slice. At 2am, I'm usually pretty hungry, but even then two slices is a lot for me. This never stops me from getting two, though.

OK - it's not ultra gourmet, wood oven pizza. and yes, it's kinda greasy. But guess what. It's in freaking Champaign, IL - not even the cultural flower of the C-U area. And I don't eat pizza as a health food.

Fight the post bar crowd, and do it. Or, even better, go every day for lunch, and accelerate their inevitable domination of this planet."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE WINGS.  I don't even think they were fully cooked.  Mild wing sauce was watery and bland.  Pizza was average, sausage was very good but the 'premium' pepperoni was simply too small to be able to get a gauge in it's taste.  Simply not the Antonio's of days past....a shame."}
{"text":"Pizza is great toppings are delicious I'm getting down on a meat supreme with some co-workers only thing stopping a 5 star rating is the lack of sauce, perhaps I'll ask for extra next time"}
{"text":"At last! Thin crust pizza! Portlandians, if you are cravings Hot Lips and you are somehow stuck in C-U, this is probably your best option. I go to Antonio's when I want pizza and I don't have time to wait 45 minutes to an hour for pizza at Dells. I am a pepperoni man but the other custom pizzas have looked tempting. Comparing the price to quality, the quality slightly outweighs the costs. The staff is friendly and I like that they have copies of the Daily Illini to read in case you did not bring friends with you to socialize."}
{"text":"Friday night, pizza and a salad wow. Absolutely awesome, as described in other reviews soft, chewy, buttery crust with an abundance of toppings.  Hunks of real sausage and a slightly sweet sauce. The antipasta salad with house dressing outstanding. Fresh made with thick cuts of ham and salami, with plenty of other fresh toppings."}
{"text":"I am completely blown away by their customer service. They have gone above and beyond to make sure we were completely satisfied. Our home is out of their delivery range and they still sent a huge pizza and a gift card. We will definitely be back. Thank you for all you have done!"}
{"text":"True Italian NYC style pizza! And pasta I have been lookin in Charlotte for something this authentic for 5 years and they nailed it all! I love it and recommend for everyone to try!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Antonio's and I would say it's my favorite place to eat at while I'm in Charlotte. They have the best prices and some of the best tasting food. You can get actual Italian dinners here for around ten dollars and that's pretty amazing.

Last time I went I go the chicken parm sub which was perfect. The chicken had a good crisp and their sauce is sweet in a good way. My fiancée got cheese ravioli in a pink sauce and loved it. We also got garlic knots and how can you go wrong with that?

Also, I've had their actual chicken parmesan over noodles and was impressed. The owner is really nice and it's a great family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I came strictly for the potato pizza. Wish more places would make it!
But- no potato pizza to be found and they weren't planning on making more.
Why is it on the menu if you aren't planning to serve it?
I settled for a cheese slice.
It was good. But overall? Not impressed.

**update**
email from the manager said he's sorry and if I come back- he'll guarantee potato pizza.  I don't plan on being there anytime soon....but...nice effort."}
{"text":"Sigh why does everyone like Antonio's so much?  Thin crust = yuck.  Toppings = all oil.  Ingredient freshness = questionable.  Price = (2)*(As expensive as it should be considering the previously implied high oil:crust thickness ratio).  Maybe I just enjoy getting sleazed on by the pizza slicers less than the average Antonio's patron?

The only redeeming quality of this place is the outlandish variety of toppings:  tortellini, tortilla chips, blue cheese, steak, bacon, you name it, they will cover it in oil and leer at you while they slice it up for you."}
{"text":"Great selection of specialty pizzas that you probably won't find anywhere else \"spinach artichoke pizza!! \" really extensive menu too as far as wings, subs, salads, desserts, etc. So far everything I've had was pretty good after a handful of visits."}
