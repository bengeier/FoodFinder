{"text":"We were excited to try this as we live near by and have waited for this location to open up. Sadly, we were impressed. The pulled pork and brisket were okay but each of the four sides we had seemed to come from Sysco or some other food service company. Competition is tough here for BBQ and the expectation is that the sides are homemade and part of the experience. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"BBQ was so moist, and the brisket was very juicy and tender. Delicious homemade coleslaw and a great array of sauces. Wish they were open through the week! A definite must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great bbq! Their brisket is very juicy and their slaw is to die for. Love their food and the price is  very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in years!!  Ribs were hot and fall off the bone delicious, with a great selection od sauces too!!  I'll definitely be back next time I'm within 100 miles!! The owners were very friendly and gave us the grand tour as well!!  Hats off to Smokey and the Pig!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! They have wonderful smoked meats that are so juicy & delicious. All their meat is full of great smoked flavor & seasonings. The sides are tasty & exactly what you would want with good BBQ. Give it a try you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best bbq I have had in a long time. Ribs were so tender and filled with natural wood smoke flavor. I love it when they use a real smoker like this. Family owned and operated, Met the owners too, really nice people."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back to Asheville from a day hike Chimney Rock State Park and expected to have some fantastic local barbecue. Very disappointed as the chopped pork was dry and the brisket wasn't particularly flavorful. Cole slaw was alright, though the sweet pickles in it were unexpected. Potato salad was average and came from a store bought container. There were a few bbq sauce options such as Sweet Baby Ray's, which is good for what it is, but I'd hoped to have a homemade sauce. The people were nice though, and it was cheap."}
