{"text":"Toujours des erreurs dans les commandes et le plus intéressant de ce restaurant c'est son poulet à l'ananas qui est fait de boule de pâte )grosseur d'un kiwi) avec un petit morceau de poulet et c'est tout, aucune sauce et aucun légumes et surtout aucun fruits (comme de l'ananas). Leur poulet à l'ananas ne contient aucun ananas."}
{"text":"A very small restaurant. Only three tables. People mainly here for take outs.  There are two sets of menus. One you can find General Tao and lemon beef. The other one has most genuine spicy dishes from China. The dishes were so spicy that once gave me allergy reaction on my skin. No kidding. Before that I had thought myself can handle spicy dishes very well.  The Chinese name of the restaurant is ???? which includes a city named Chongqing.  It is famous for the hot pot and other spicy food, such as spicy boiled fish/beef and some salad. Ask for less spicyness. Their beef noodle is worth it trying also.  Ask for the Chinese menu with pics. Worth a try if you love spicy food."}
{"text":"Ok so you have to order the specials like the marinated beef and cold noodles. I don't know about the regular take out stuff, but I don't eat westernized Chinese food as they don't jive with my taste buds.   Call in advance and they have wechat stuff.......but I'm still trying to get my wechat to work. :("}
