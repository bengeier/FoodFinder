{"text":"It's good cuisine! Spanish cuisine... It's a good place to go to, not the best in the world, but you're not paying that much for it so it's all right. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group and simply had a great time. The group menu was super affordable, offered variety of dishes and was really accommodating for people with allergies."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never reviewed la Sala Rosa. Although I have been to many shows at its venue, in this review here, I am reviewing the restaurant. I'm very impressed that over the years, the food quality at Sala hasn't changed, there is still passion there. It's a 5-star restaurant. 5-star attentive staff who know exactly what they are doing, 5-star entertainment on Thursday nights with a live flamenco show while you eat!! 5-star original atmosphere where you feel cozy, comfy and yet part of the action. 5-star price-quality ratio (it's cheap!). And, most importantly, 5-star food. Tapas galore. Try the croquettes, the fried goat cheese & honey, the melt-in-your-mouth mussels and use bread to soak up all the delicious sauces. Order anything, it will be good. They also have a big back room that can host huge parties. After dinner, you can head upstairs where they have a live venue hosting bands."}
{"text":"Look for the unassuming street entrance and ask to sit near the flamenco music on Thursday evenings. Wonderful tapas and paella! Go with friends so you can sample many different menu items."}
{"text":"The restaurant on the first floor is one of my favorites in Montreal, especially for a large group of people.

They serve a great selection of tapas and the paellas are amazing. I suggest sharing a couple of tapas dishes (1 per person) and then ordering a paella (1 is good for 2-4 people). The potato croquettes are delicious. The sangria is also a must-have.

I just simply love the ambiance; it feels like you're having dinner in a family restaurant in the middle of Spain. 

I suggest you make a reservation, especially if you're planning to go there on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"came here for popfest to see thee oh sees and the fresh and onlys.  what was smart about the setup was in order for there to be less time in between the last two bands, the headlining band had their instruments set up on the floor, away from the stage and ready to play.  i wish more places would do this, as it kept the energy level constant.

people went crazy, i mean really crazy, prompting the singer to ask \"what is wrong with you people?\" but i think that was in reference to the guy who, for some reason, decided to take his shirt off and jump on top of the crowd.  still, it's refreshing to see an entire room of people dancing at a show instead of just standing around posing (i'm looking at you NYC.)

the venue is on top of a restaurant and bar.  i can't imagine the racket the people below must have heard with the floor shaking from everyone jumping up and down, but i think the restaurant portion was closed by then (the shows start on the later side.)

drinks are cheap.. 3.50 shots 4.50 mixed drinks.  they didn't have bourbon.  other than that i really liked the place."}
{"text":"You have to have to have to come here for tapas and flamenco show on Thursday night. This is a quaint little institute - it is not a restaurant really, it feels like a Spanish expat social club in Montreal. Once you step in, you are in Spain - not Barcelona but this small Spanish town by the sea. The free show starting at 845 every Thursday is terrific. It is actually the first flamenco show I saw. I was astonished by how beautiful and fun it was. The female dancer was full of passion. The musicians were happy, cheering. They put together an unforgettable performance. 
Yes, I tried the goat cheese fried ball with honey. It is indeed delicious. So was the grilled squid. The paella was OK. It is not an expensive restaurant and not fancy but very cozy. It is not the great tapas you get in a fusion tapas restaurant, but you feel more in Spain then in any other Tapas place. 

Love love loved it, will def take another out of town guests here :-)"}
{"text":"Je n'ai été qu'au restaurant, deux fois. C'est vraiment très bon! En plus il y a de la place et ils cuisinent jusqu'à 23h (le vendredi en tout cas)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there's so few reviews for a place like Sala, a long time fixture in the Mile End/Plateau 'hood, the younger (but bigger) sister to Casa del Popolo, and a favorite venue. I'm not an expert when it comes to acoustics, so I can't speak to that but I CAN say that when The Walkmen played there last year it sounded AWESOME. 

The tapas restaurant at Sala and the venue aren't really the same business, but for our purposes they may as well be. First, the restaurant.  It doesn't hurt to make a reso if you're 4 or more but chances are you won't need to. I like it here best in the fall or winter (it's cozy and warm) with 2 or 3 friends, a litre of the house red (which is cheap and drinkable, and that's about all i can say about it) and plates of chorizo, calamari, garlic shrimp, rapini, and fried honey drizzled cheese balls that should be on the dessert menu. With 3 people the bill would be what? 70 bucks with tip?  

Sala Rossa upstairs is great. They book a wide selection of bands and events (DJ nights/occasional readings and performance) and it's large enough that it can feel like a total party but small enough that that party feels organic. It gets pretty not in there some nights. 

I don't have much love for the bar selection - no bourbon, no wine, beer might be warm -  or the bartenders. Some of the same people have been there since way back and a few of them seem tired, a little unpleasant.  Like, I'm doing you a huge favor right now, so let's just appreciate that. Know'msaying? But the drinks are cheap and it's a pretty minor woe in a place where everyone is usually friendly.  

A tip: The restrooms at Sala upstairs are pretty small and often just  freshly out of toilet paper, so if you're faced with a line up follow the staircase all the way to the basement where you'll find both men's and women's restrooms with 4 stalls each. 

Dig!"}
{"text":"Went back for a friends birthday, was happy to go back.

Ordered one dish per person average and managed to have a nice meal! with the decent bread basket, people who didn't want to drink could try a ton of delicious things for like $20

For those who got wine, they had one of my favourite affordable ones for a small markup.

The cheese balls were amazing, the leeks amazing, quail quite nice. Avoid the the croquettes; shrimp I liked, the beef thing we got was also wonderful.

STRONG recommendations, especially for big groups. Several others had parties there and it was just great."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last Sunday

We were in a bit of a rush to hit the road back to NYC at a decent hour, so I can't hold That fact against them, but the service was extremely slow. It took over a half an hour for our food to come out and the place was only half full. 

Once the food came, it was not worth the wait. I got the juevos rancheros and my buddy got the pancakes. Neither were great."}
{"text":"We have been going here for decades and can never get enough of it. It's always great being greeted by charming Monica, the services is always top notch. Great prices on drinks and food is very reasonable. What makes this so much fun is the mix of cultures that mesh together."}
{"text":"The worst place I've been to in Montreal. The food was disgusting. There was one good thing I ate, the potatoes and you can't really mess those up. It was bad just don't go."}
{"text":"This is a great, low-key Spanish tapas restaurant. We ordered a 1/2 of pitcher of sangria to start (this didn't sway the review!). Then proceeded to order the goat cheese and honey, pulpo (octopus), and the croquetas. We got the albondigas (meatballs), but they were a little on the dry side. 

Have I been to Spain? Yes. Would this compare to the food in Spain? No. Would it satisfy a craving? Yes."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

There's a dumpy feel to the place. You walk in and say \"this might be cool\" but at the end you're like \"really... 90$ for that?\" 

The food was ok. Not the best Spanish food in town. Not at the price they charge. Spend another 25$ and go to Pintxo or Tapeo. It's worth the difference. 

I really wanted to like it. I live 5 min away by foot! But I won't go back."}
{"text":"In summary, this place is extraordinarily hit or miss.

The location is great and the ambience is nice - you feel like you're in the great room of an old Spanish Home. The shrimp and patatas bravas are fantastic - so don't miss that.

However most other things we tried were below par. The squash/cheddar croquettes tasted like potatoes more than anything else. The paella was flavorless - and we eat a LOT of paella. The calamari was soft (coating), rubbery and under seasoned.

Good thing was the service though - friendly staff and a welcoming set of customers. The drinks were good too. Fix the food and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Played a gig here on St. Patrick's Day at the bar. Can't comment on the food, though I saw it coming in and out of the restaurant while lugging gear up, and I was sure jealous of the people who were getting to eat it. Pretty laid-back, considering what day it was. They treat the bands well, which is no small thing. Sound is pretty good, if a bit cavernous (think talent show at your high-school auditorium, but a bit more refined); it's nice to be at a venue that's built around performance."}
{"text":"Vraiment bel ambiance de restaurant . C'est bien d'y  aller avec un groupe   d'amis .Bonne bouffe espagnole . Beau design ."}
{"text":"Very good tapas. Paella not so great... The rice is a bit soggy.
 Overall quite good, the sangria is great - it has more wine than in most places, so it's not watered down by juice or soft drink."}
{"text":"The restaurant at Sala holds a special place in many MTL'ers hearts and memories, but I hadn't been in a long time. Recently Jeremiah Bullied took over as owner chef and I was excited to go see what this travelling, pickling, kindly master of deliciousness was doing with the old Spanish social club. We went last night to check it out and though the changes being made so far are subtle they are a great indication of new life and exceptional cooking happening in the lovely old room looking out over St Laurent. 

The classics are all still there, just better: the bread is all homemade and is so freaking good. The goat cheese balls are still changing people's lives, the rapini now comes with kale and preserved lemons and is way better than before, and the chorizo is juicier and tastier than it has been in years. We tried the specials, a pumpkin soup with caramelized onions and toasted seeds and it was unlike anything I've eaten before and I want to eat it every day until May. The other special was Southern-friend quail in lemon gravy on pickled brussels sprouts. Everything about this dish was amazing, except I'm not a quail fan, I think it's stupid, but that's just me. 

The team here is making tiny changes to the room and the menu and I look forward to going back often to seeing how it all progresses. The fresh coat of white paint feels clean and amazing, and the other little tasteful updates to the decor are smart and good looking. Well worth a revisit, go get it!!"}
{"text":"Gotta be one of the top indie rock venues in the city.  I've seen a number of great shows here, including the late, great Jay Reatard (R.I.P.).  It's the epitome of a good concert hall - cool looking, great sound, and cheap beer combined with quick service. And as other reviewers have posted, they're pretty quick on the turnaround between sets, which doesn't hurt. I should also note the coat check - important for going out in the cold (and I think was only $1). 

This was one of the first places I went after moving here and it felt like home to me. As long as they keep booking the top indie acts, I'll definitely be in the crowd."}
{"text":"where you can see a good concert and enjoy a good paella = paradise !"}
{"text":"I played a gig here last weekend, and it was great. I'd been to Casa many times, but first time here. From a performance perspective, the team there were awesome and really helped us sound good and were quick and efficient. We got some drink tickets, so I went down for food/drinks.

I sat at the bar, and ordered 2-3 gin tonics and some calamari, and it was awesome. Great gin tonics, good tapas, and good prices. Friendly too. More friendly than bar folk at Casa, though I love that place.

Will definitely return, most likely if there's a band playing etc, I'll go eat downstairs first. Totally. 

Most places in Montreal like this, with a reputation, I've found to be overhyped and a bit of the past, but Sala stood up for me."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas été au restaurant. J'ai été à l'étage pour voir un spectacle. Alors, cette critique est complètement basée sur mon expérience à la salle de spectacle. La salle est relativement grande, je dirais 150-200 personnes...peut-être même plus. 

J'aime bien l'aménagement. Les tables sur le côté, la voie libre dans le milieu. Le son était étrangememt vraiment clair pour les trois groupes. Les prix varient entre 5$ et 6$ pour un verre de bière ou drink. Le seul petit défaut est que le nom du restaurant est écrit sur une feuille de papier dans la vitre. Alors, j'ai manqué la porte plusieurs fois et failli ne jamais rentré. Merci à mon GPS mais sinon très satisfait."}
{"text":"La Sala Rossa is a great venue, on the small side with a bar, scattered tables and a nice stage.
They book great shows here ( caught Mt.Eerie in the Spring) and it's run by the same people as Casa del Popolo 
(NOTE:some of the reviews on the Casa..page are for La Sala Rossa).
There's also a restaurant downstairs but I've yet to check it out."}
{"text":"On m'a convaincu d'aller à Sala Rossa avec peu de mots: fromage de chèvre frit au miel. Miam!

En me rendant à Sala Rossa pour la première fois, j'ai failli manquer la porte d'entrée parce que le bâtiment où le resto s'y trouve ressemble plutôt à un centre communautaire, et pour une bonne raison. Sala Rossa a déjà été un important centre communautaire de la communauté espagnole de Montréal, et l'est encore par moment. On y retrouve cours de danse flamenco, resto à tapas et salle de spectacle.

Quand j'y suis allée, c'était pour un souper entre amis. On a partagé un peu de tout : des fromages frits à différentes saveurs, des légumes grillées et une grande paella aux fruits de mer. Bien sûr, il a fallu commander une portion double du fromage de chèvre! Le menu est propice à un potluck en resto. Parfait pour les groupes d'amis qui ne sont pas dédaigneux et qui aiment partager afin de pouvoir goûter à un peu de tous les plats. Pour boire, on a choisi un vin bio que j'ai bien aimé, simplement à cause de son nom, Miracle! Il était aussi très bon au goût.

L'ambiance est très bonne, à la fois décontractée et pleine d'énergie. À partir d'une certaine heure, on pouvait commencer à entendre les battements de pieds des danseurs de flamenco au dessus de nous. Toutefois, ça n'était pas assez fort pour nous empêcher de jaser et continuer de profiter de notre soirée, donc ne vous inquiétez pas pour le bruit."}
{"text":"It was really quiet on a Wednesday night, it definitely deserve more recognition!
The newly renovated space kept its original charm while adding a bit more 'hip' vibe. All our dishes are great: 
Grilled Octopus $12 - fresh &tender, it passes the test to be a legit Spanish bistro(portion: S). 
Tortilla de patatas $10ish - very filling, great for sharing (portion: L)
Rapini in cheese & citron confit $10ish - thx to them, it's now my new favorite veges! Can't wait to try other vegetarian choices there next time (portion: M)
Special: Beef tail - $15 - tender meat in wine sauce, it can't go wrong! (portion: M)
Tapas are in perfect size to share by 2,3 or 4 people and they definitely don't break your wallet (2 dishes / person) unlike many other tapas restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"This place is home away from home. The entire staff are professional and so much fun. The room is cozy and the music is always good. I highly recommend the calamari, grilled squid, and chorizo. Ask Jasmine for proper wine recommendations."}
