{"text":"It totally reminds me of a small version of a Wenzhou restaurant (the nice looking ones). Menu selection is good with quality pictures to help you choose. My wife is from Wenzhou and she liked it do the authenticity is there. Only reason for the missing star is that is was a bit cold (even for a restaurant) but some hot tea fixed that."}
{"text":"You won't be able to find more authentic Wenzhou cuisine anywhere else in Toronto.  I love the nice decor and their wonderful wenzhou dishes that reminded me of home."}
{"text":"ZJ Chinese Restaurant was not my first choice when I was looking for somewhere for lunch at New Kennedy Square. I didn't even realize that it existed since it was open recently in replace of Omega 3 Noodle. 

The menu promising 24 different selections of Lunch Specials for $5.99 includes a can of pop or soy milk drink right on the door pulled me right in!! 

Nice cushioned booth seatings made me feel right at home and I got to practised my limited vocabulary of Mandarin too! 

Braised Pork Noodle with Soy Milk Drink ($5.99) is quite good. Portion is big and noodle though not home made but was cooked al dente. Pork was tender and quite fatty.. some might enjoy the fattiness. 

The menu is nicely done with full coloured photos easy for any customers to just point or write down the item number of the food they need! 

Grand Opening Special of 10% discount if you print that ad on their website! 

I might come back to try out some of their famous Su Hong Cuisine..."}
