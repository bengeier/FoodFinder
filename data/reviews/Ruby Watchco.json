{"text":"Visited based on all the great Yelp reviews. Service was good and the atmosphere was pretty cool. Unfortunately, the food that our party experienced didn't support all the previous rave reviews. As mentioned in all the other reviews, each night is a set menu of ~$50 pp. Make sure you go to their website and check out their weekly menus before you make a reservation. Our night included a butternut squash salad, a main dish of cod, artisanal goat cheese and jam, ending with a chocolate cake for dessert. You also have the option of adding an additional appetizer and main dish. We added a main dish of the short rib ravioli to share. Portion sizes are abundant and are served family style to share. The butternut squash salad and rib ravioli were good, but the other dishes were quite disappointing. The cod was dry, the cheese was so overpowering (it was barely touched - the server was kind enough to pack it up and suggested taking it home and then tossing it in warm pasta) and the chocolate cake tasted like a Duncan Hines cake mix. We paid just under $400 for 4 people including 3 drinks, coffee, tea and tip. For that price, I expected better quality in food. Sorry, won't be going back."}
{"text":"hard to write a food review for a restaurant that changes it's menu everyday ..since i can write what i want but no one else will be eating what i ate.

but that's kind of the beauty of it. 

you find out at the beginning of the week what the rest of the week's menu will be. there tends to be one theme or thing that remains consistent throughout the week. but the mains definitely change.

the food is done well. more than reasonable portions - we were STUFFED! service is really attentive. they take their time starting you, and bringing you food. it's all well paced. the place is bustling with noise. mixed crowd of people who've dressed up or dressed smart. dim-lit. good ambiance for all crowds and all occasions.

overall i would return for a new menu and new experience all over again."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp. Worth every buck. Awesome flood and service but you need to be adventurous and be wiling to try new tastes.

Got to the desert, and almost fainted. Just wow!!! Heaven in a bowl."}
{"text":"My wife enjoys the Food Network, and after many years of watching Lynn Crawford on television, we were eager to try her restaurant in Leslieville.

We had attempted to go on a few separate occasions, but either something last minute came up, or we were unable to secure a reservation on a desired night.  One particular date night, we finally made it!

The hostess and serving staff were friendly, and we greatly enjoyed the use of local, fresh ingredients.  We didn't have a chance to review the menu before that night (the date worked and we went!), so it was fun being surprised on the spot by the selections.  We found all the dishes quite delicious, but unfortunately my wife is not a fan of cheese, so that course wasn't particularly enjoyed as you cannot substitute any of the courses.

It was a great night, and it's neat to have a ever-changing menu, however I can see that not everyone may be a fan of this because you are limited in choice."}
{"text":"Great space.  Good service.  Loved the food....portions were respectable too.
Will be a regular here."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favourite restaurants. The ambiance is great, daily cocktails are creative and tasty and the food is divine. Considering I enjoyed polenta (yuck) I think that says a lot. Luck of the draw is that all three of my visits have been on fried chicken night, but even then it was made differently and the sides were different each time. Servers are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"It really is as good as it gets. Went last night for a second time and was so pleased with the selected menu (the additional sweetbreads course was added - and was a wise decision). From the salad to the dessert, and everything else in between, every bite was incredible.  

On both occasions, the staff completely exceeded my expectations. Chef Crawford was quick to refill our wine glasses and clear away the empty plates. 

Will certainly come back again!"}
{"text":"Great high quality food. Although the price was also high quality.  Not exactly my weekly joint. But once in awhile for a birthday is ok.  It was delicious, from beginning to end. But after the fix price meal, bone marrow add-on and a bottle of wine, my wallet was in a lot pain..."}
{"text":"Simplicity overpowers any outrageous nouveau culinary style and technique. The result is a fabulously delicious meal. The prix fix menu changes daily and is posted on their website. The main was a perfectly done beef tournedos, we had the decadent optional foie gras, preceded by a fresh salad with an avocado dressing. The cheese course was satisfying, while the chocolate torte was exceptional. Food was excellent and so good without over-trying. Service was very good, as our server Don is a seasoned and personable server. DÃ©cor and ambiance have a hip swankiness. Drinks are really tasty, while wines are plentiful to choose from and not excessive in price.
Next visit will be determined by the daily menu, where something will grab my attention, compelling me to return."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. However, the fixed menu may leave some frustrated by some of the food options, since there is no flexibility."}
{"text":"Good food and a laid back atmosphere. 

Thoughts...

-On the night we were there basically 80% of the clientele was large-ish groups of 30-40 year old women out for a \"girls night\" - which makes for some hilarious eavesdropping but definitely kills the romantic atmosphere

-Food is great and it's nice to eat a family style meal at a restaurant - a welcome change, however, it was definitely not one of the best meals I've had in Toronto. The food is delicious, but safe - feels like a step up from the meals my mom would cook.

-The service is good, but nothing special. The two sets of seating times also makes the service a bit awkward in my opinion...when we first sat down all the servers seemed really busy clearing out the tables that were leaving.

Overall a good place - and fun for a group meal, but definitely not the most innovative or delicious places in town."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Ruby Watchco on wed evening. being a vegetarian I was slightly apprehensive as to whether there would be food for me to eat. To my delight there is a full vegan/vegetarian menu. The wait staff were incredible, the food was delicious..  If you are looking for a restaurant that has a great atmosphere, great service and great food then go to Ruby Watchco. I had a green salad to start with melt in your mouth herb scones. To follow I had a series of veg dishes, followed by cheese platter, and then the most incredible hazelnut choc gateau..  My meat loving friends had lamb which they said melted in their mouths.. Good side portions, generous glasses of wine.. 
this is a thumbs up... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectation was elevated from having dined at and had very positive interactions with Canadian and International celebrity chefs, but this foodie was a wee bit disappointed with my experience at Ruby Watchco on Saturday, Sept 27. Having arrived on time for our late seating and with the restaurant still completely full from the early seating, we were placed at the bar to wait. No big deal, the early crowd was running late due to their late arrival resulting from a highway closure. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, watched the bartender work at the speed of lightening and observed Chef Lynn working busily behind the bar. No smiles from Chef as she worked on cleaning dishes and getting the music up and running. We had figured she would be all over obliging her patrons, but even after our friend told her how my husband had researched Toronto restaurants and picked hers for us to experience on our trip from out of province, she still did not say hello!  I was OK with the lack of enthusiasm from Chef Lynn. I understand everyone has a bad day now and then. It was just a little odd to me, as I met Wolfgang Puck twice at his restaurants as he made a point to visit each table and thank each patron individually, as did Michael Smith at his Feast in the Field and we were invited into the kitchen at the French Laundry. Just a few great and memorable experiences we've been fortunate enough to have; however, at this point I was still looking forward to the meal. 

Our meal was a Chef Lori creation. It consisted of amazing brussel sprouts, lacklustre potato scallop, butternut squash cubes that were not fully cooked, and an OK meat dish. The cheese tray was fine, but I can't even remember the dessert (ask me about the grapefruit givre at Chef Boulud's restaurant in the Four Seasons though -AMAZING)!  After drinks, a bill of over $200 seemed ridiculous for what we received, and I'm OK with spending big money on dinner and drinks. My husband is a wonderful cook and often creates dishes more memorable. If we had of had a positive experience upon seeing Chef Lynn, perhaps this would have made up for the mediocre meal and I wouldn't have felt liked I was overcharged. Possibly. 

Anyhow, a long review to say the space was tight, the food was mediocre and overpriced; however, our waiter was fine. In truth, I'm not so sure what all of the Ruby Watchco hype is all about."}
{"text":"A very refreshing place to go and have a lovely meal. It is great to see the owners so involved in this place. Not only does Lynn Crawford ensure that each meal is perfectly cooked and presented to patrons she also serves many herself while describing the dish to you. The staff was fantastic and very professional with no ego or attitude being dished out to customers. It was also nice to see each of the owners rolling up their sleeves; everything from greeting people to cooking to setting and clearing tables.  A fantastic experience with great service, food and ambiance.  You have a new fan Ruby Watchco!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my evening here tonight. We arrived 2 hr earlier than expected but where seated right away! The place looked about 1/2 full when we arrived at 7:30pm. 

Tonight Jan 10, 2012 we dined on:

SOVEREIGN FARM'S BUTTERNUT SQUASH SALAD Sleger's Living Greens, Arugula, A.F.G's Cucumbers, Pancetta, Candied Hazelnuts, Brown Derby Dressing
- delicious mix of ingredients with nice touch of hazelnut


RUBY'S BRICK CHICKEN WITH WARM OLIVE & SHALLOT VINAIGRETTE Roasted Cauliflower with 10 Yr Old Cheddar Cheese Sauce, Smashed Sweet Potatoes with Spinach Pesto, Charred Broccoli with Lemon Butter
- I'm not a fan of chicken but the skin and dark meat were delicious, the sides were the best actually, the smooth creamy cauliflower was my fav of the 3 small dishes. 


CANADIAN ARTISANAL CHEESE
Carron Farm's Red Beets
- cheese. Not a big fan of cheese. Also never ate red beets before so that's a first to me. Tasted OK. 


CITRUS GOAT YOGHURT PARFAIT Winter Fruit Compote, Vanilla Syrup
- this dessert was delicious. So creamy. 

Bill for 2 came to ~$112 plus tips. I will be back! Hopping for fish and chocolate!! Hehehe

Sadly, I did not see Lynn in the kitchen. :( would love to have met her."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant a year ago.  Our friend booked 2 months in advance, and the expectation was met!  

Party of 6, lucky enough to sit nice and close to the kitchen...and saw Chef Lynn in action.  My husband and friends even went up to speak with Chef Lynn, lovely lady.  

Food:  DELICIOUS!!!  Good portion, sharing plates were awesome among the 6 of us.  We all walked away holding our tummy but satisfied.  

I will try to make reservation near Mother's day now..."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were amazing, Lynne and the rest of the staff were very friendly, even took a few minutes out of her busy evening to chat and take a quick photo. You will not be disappointed by the family style meals, lots of flavors to satisfy the foodie in you. I cannot wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Six of us ladies (50 +) had dinner last night at Ruby Watchco. Our waiter was good and the service was very good. Food was tasty but the portions were small. The cheese plate was one thin piece of cheese each about 1 \" x 1\", not exactly a cheese plate. Our complaint was the noise, the music was so loud it was impossible to talk to each other. I talked (loudly) to the lady across from me and the one beside me but there was no way I could hear the other three. Three times we asked nicely if the volume could be turned down but nothing was done. At one point we were even told, \" it's even louder on Saturday\"...like that's a good thing? This isn't a club it isn't a place with a bunch of teenagers, it was a mature crowd so we just couldn't understand the logic of having the music so loud with dinner. 
We don't all get together that often, we spent around $700.00 but as good as the food was, the over all experience was a major disappointment. We are all fans of Chef Lynne from TV so it was unfortunate that we all left feeling"}
{"text":"The food here is all it's hyped up to be.

I'm hesitant about eating at establishments with tasting menus because your dinner can be ruined with just one \"off\" dish.

Not here!  Everything was bang-on and delicious.

Beet and Peach salad was divine.  Just the right amount of dressing, great flavour contrast and textures.
Steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and juicy.
The sides are probably what tipped me over the edge.  Actually, one in particular....the roasted cauliflower with pistachios.  Why has NO ONE ever told me about roasted cauliflower?  That side was AMAZING.  So simple, but utterly delightful.  

The price was very reasonable as well.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It takes a while to get a reservation here so plan early and opt for the later seating if you can to avoid feeling rushed.

The good was actually great.  The atmosphere is amazing for a big group or small and the family style service and set menu make for a relaxed and fun journey through the three course meal.  Some of the food was truly amazing but other parts were just okay ( al dente root vegetables for example).  The suggested pairings were excellent but the alcohol price tag is not for the faint of heart or wallet.

The major negative was the service which, since it was a fixed menu and set schedule should have been easy to excel at.  They neglected to ask one of the party for a cocktail order when we arrived and it was further delayed in being served leaving that person scrambling to play catch up in order to enjoy the pairings.  At the end of the meal we were asked to hurry up and leave so they could seat the next group.  While perfectly understandable if we had been lingering for some time following our meal, we had in fact barely received and figured out the not insubstantial bill before we were unceremoniously ejected from our seats and forced to mill about while they searched for the coats they had removed from us at the start of the evening.  If you are going to make the sittings so tight AND you have total control over all aspects of the service I think you should work a little harder on timing and ease of transition to avoid leaving a jarring note at the end of what was a very pleasant meal.

Definitely room for improvement but a great experience for a special occasion."}
{"text":"How is it possible that I'm the first to review Chef Lynne's new project? Are all yelpers stuck in the West End? If so, get out get out get out! It's time to head east dear friends, straight into the kitchen of Ruby Watchco. 

The dinner is a prix fixe menu that features LOCAL (cheese from Peterborough was about as far flung as it got) produce and meat done in a hearty but contemporary way.  Because the menu changes with what's available, you can return as often as you like and know you wont have run out of choices.  There are four courses: appetizer, main, cheese, & dessert and all are served family style in lovely Creuset dishes.  Don't worry, there is plenty of food, so please go with a very empty stomach. (we were pretty tapped out once we go to the cheese dish, but discreetly undid our belts to stuff more delicious toffee cake down the gullet). 

The staff are phenomenal, and though your server may rotate, you never feel as though the service is impersonal.  The hostess checked in on us several times and was even so kind as to pass on her card so we could make reservations in the future.  Lynn Crawford is phenomenal as well.  The pass is in plain view of all diners and she spent the night smiling, bringing out dishes when she could, and even took a moment to snap a photo with me (lame I know). 

Though new on the scene, reservations are hard to come by - we tried on Tuesday to make a reservation for Friday and were told there was no space.  But don't let a lack of confirmed seating stop you from going, the bar is lovely and fine for 2 people to sit at for dinner.  We happened to luck out and grab a table from people who had canceled.

It's the morning after my night with Ruby and I'm still a little food coma'd so please excuse my lack of wit.  She wore me out and left me wanting more."}
{"text":"Deserves every 5 star review it gets, fantastic service (always there but not in your face) and the food is so so good!"}
{"text":"Wow.  

A cheerful place to get a delicious dinner!  

The menu is 4 courses of freshness (with 2 add on options if you want of course).   It's a fixed price menu that changes on an daily basis and which you don't know until the week of.  I They do have a walk in, at the bar, but I recommend making a reservation to guarantee yourself a seat at a table.  Don't be afraid of what you will be getting that day!  The food is bonafide delicious!  

If you do have any allergies, to the food they are serving tell them in advance!  I didn't have any issues but it's better to let them know!

The environment is loud, fun and the servers are hilarious.  I think the best way to think of it is going over to an old friend's house while you have some great food and share some laughs.  

Thank you Antony for being such a good and comforting host!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. So I was told that in order to get a reservation, you had to book weeks in advance. We decided at the last minute to try this place by calling the day before and when we arrived the next day - confusion - they were a full house!  Apparently they buy just enough food to make portions for the number of reservations - though there may have been seats, we were out of luck since they ran out of meat.

Attempt no. 2....we were more astute the second time around and called to reserve one week ahead of time.

So how else to say this but we were there on \"Pork\" night. We had a salad which was a largeg portion with beans, beet shreddings, lettuce, onions, and very fresh corn from the cob. It was delicious.  I was almost full after the apetizer.

Next came the family style mains - 1. mini pancakes with slices of what seemed like slices of friend pork, 2. pork chop drenched in a orange squash/pumpkin puree sauce that had a cinnamon taste to it and sprinkles of fresh dill 3. sweet potatoe and mushroom (3 dif kinds - porcinni, shitake, and basic) mixed in a heavy creamy white sauce, and grilled brocoli (slightly burnt at the top) with a lemon white cream sauce.  Dessert was a apple crumble that we ended up taking home.

We also got a glass of wine to share. I think the bill was around $100 or so.

Service was great...our waiter was very friendly and casual.

Love the ambiance...very cozy chic...!

I wouldn't pick this place to go everyday but its worth going to try it. Personally i found that although quality was amazing and fresh, the combinations were a bit too innovative for my palette."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great food and service! Check out menu before reserving because one dish per night! Fish dishes are light and flavourful"}
{"text":"It really kills me to write this review, but here it goes.

Last night, after much anticipation (about a year) I finally dined at Ruby Watchco.

I was super excited about eating here, so maybe my expectations where too high, but by the end of the main course, I just wanted the experience to be over.

Ruby Watcho is a nice place that feels rustic and welcoming. 

The service throughout the night was standard. Service was nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. 

But we were really there for the food.
We started out with salad with shrimp, radishes and other vegetables. Ok, I'm no master chef, but I can cook well. This salad was honestly something my mother would make; only this had more high quality ingredients. The taste was bland and the dressing was watery. There was nothing exciting about this dish.

Our mains where pork loin, tomato studded with rice, chickpea salad and grilled tomatoes with some pesto on top. Once again, so boring!
Yes, the ingredient where fresh, and yes, it was well prepared as in the texture of the pork was moist, but this food was flavorless! 
I mean, the only seasoning I tasted was salt! 
I also found the salads to be oily. We where both complete underwhelmed and boarded with this food. Nothing I eat felt like something I could not make better at home if I used fresh, local ingredients. I'm not saying this to brag, but I have made simple homey, meals using all fresh ingredients and they have tasted better than anything I had here last night.

When I go to a restaurant and especially when you are paying these prices, I want to be excited about the food I'm eating. The food should be an experience and not just a average meal you could prepare if you put in a bit of effort.

The cheese after dinner was amazing (the one thing they did not make) and at this point, we where over the whole experience. Surprisingly the lemon raspberry tart that looked dry and unappetizing in appearance, was the highlight of the whole meal. The pastry was good and the raspberry and lemon curd was very tasty.

I will give Ruby Watchco a 2.5star review. The ingredients are all fresh. But there was absolutely no wow factor to anything we ate and I did not feel like I could not find a recipe off epicurious and make the same thing myself, with more flavors. The lack of flavor was the disappointing factor in my meal. 
I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, this is my honest review."}
{"text":"I've had this place on a short list since last year, and it was worth the wait. I chose to go on Friday partly because of the menu for that night (salmon etc.). Chef Lynn was on had chatting to patrons and there was one other celebrity sighting at the bar that night (hi Tommy). 

I love the vibe of this place. My food highlight was the cheddar cheese biscuits, the salmon and that wonderful sauce it sat on, the tomato jam that came with the cheese course, and the wine that was paired with dessert.

If you can't get enough of the restaurant, You must check out Ruby Eats a few stores away that sells gourmet groceries."}
{"text":"This place is everything I enjoy in a restaurant experience, without any of the fluff and pretentiousness of some of the more upscale eateries.  

First off is the food, inventive, with a constantly changing menu, thoughtfully prepared and with a focus on flavours rather than ostentatious presentation and gimmicky garnishes.  Chef Crawford was visible the whole time cooking in the kitchen and took time after to talk to guests.  You know that she is in her element, creating unique dishes every night using a variety of ingredients and preparation techniques.  I like that the menu is set since you're forced out of your comfort zone to experience different items that you may not usually order but delight when you try them.  Everything was deceptively simple yet the menu reveals the intricate nature of the ingredients.  

As opposed to other reviewers i would say don't check out the menu when booking and just go and trust Chef Crawford's artistry."}
{"text":"I loved the food and atmosphere of Ruby Watchco.

I would like to give it 5 stars but I have to deduct one for:
-Poor beer selection. Two Mill Sts, Beau's Lagered Ale, and two big brand light beers? Come on. There are tons of great local beer that should be featured here. Mill St is fine as a big brand, but it shouldn't be the anchor of this type of restaurant's beer menu.
-Huge portions. It's irresponsible and wasteful to serve so much food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, attentive but not annoying waiters, easy and cosy atmosphere! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Famed Restaurant Makeover dynamic duo, designer Cherie Stinson and celebrity chef Lynn Crawford have opened up Ruby Watchoo .  I've been so excited to try this place and finally with the right occasion, my bestie's Stacey's birthday, we all headed to Leslieville for a culninary adventure. Joey, Cherie's husband was a perfect host for the evening with his entertaining anecdotes and chatty conversation making us feel right at home.

What you need to know about Ruby is that the restaurant serves a $49 prix fixed menu with 4 courses - salad, main, cheese plate and dessert which changes nightly featuring local and seasonal ingredients.  When you call to make a reservation they'll ask you if you have any dietary restrictions or allergies so be honest!  This is NOT a restaurant with a menu where you can pick and choose.  You eat what they're making! 
The basket of warm and savoury cheddar cheese bisquits with chives is definitely one of the highlights.  They are so buttery and airy.  We all fight for a second serving and thirds. Everything here is served family style so you can help yourself to as much or as little as you wanted.   It was really amazing that they were able to tailor make our dishes for us to accommodate our food allergies."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences in the city. The vibe is feel good, non pretentious with sophistication. The staff were extremely knowledgable, and enthusiastic about making our dining experience exceptional. The food was 4 courses of awesome, served family style. Fresh, traditional ingredients with unique touches prepared in house by chef Lynne herself. Try the wine pairing if it's available - best decision ever."}
{"text":"Like most people, I had high expectations when my wife and I ate here. All you hear about are the glowing reviews and the difficulty in getting a reservation.

I'd say Ruby Watchco met most of my expectations. We left without any big complaints and a desire to return for another special occasion.

The main course was grilled flank steak with whiskey butter and crispy onions. Except for one or two pieces, the meat was cooked perfectly and it mixed nicely with the whiskey butter and crispy onions.

It was served alongside corn on the cob (sprinkled with chili lime rub), potato salad and some kind of cabbage-based salad that I wasn't a fan of.

Before that we had an incredible salad with marinated tomatoes.

Between the main course and dessert we were served some kind of smoke cheese from Quebec - also wasn't a fan of that, but I never have been a huge fan of most artisanal cheeses.

By the time we got our dessert (June's \"almost famous\" carrot cake) my wife, looking stuffed, remarked: \"I feel like I've been eating forever.\"

She was right. When it comes to portions, you do not get stiffed here. There was more than enough food for the two of us, and we struggled to finish it all.

The staff was friendly and very professional.

As mentioned above, we're planning another visit (as long as we can get a reservation) for another special occasion.

Very happy that this place is a fixture in Leslieville."}
{"text":"I like the attempt at the concept but it was also a bit annoying. Reservation is a must, difficult to arrange and schedule eating slots makes it impossible to come here spontaneously. Prix fixe, changing menu with days special. Added but pricey and a bit of a let down. Good for large groups since food is family style but not for couples. The food overall, good. There were highlights like the main protein and sides. Seasoned and cooked well.  Dessert on that day which was a chocolate cake was very pedestrian. Overall ambience, was busy, too efficient at times."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner once. I have to say that although the food was okay, nothing really stood out. Maybe the bill? I think it's a little overrated and overpriced. I expected more depending on the raving reviews here...Doesn't really live up to the hype, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Whenever I eat at Ruby's I know everything's going to be just right.   Last night was no different.   It's the kind of place that doesn't have to get everything right -  EVERY night - because it so often does.   

Most of the food  - the cured organic salmon salad with red beets, the mushroom and leek bread pudding, the garlic butter roasted yellow beans and the lemon tart - were seriously close-my-eyes scrumptious, the kind of delicious that reminds you, when you're feeling crap, that life can sometimes be shockingly worth it.

The only item that was less than perfect was the slow roasted sirloin that was a tiny bit dry.   My man doesn't agree, but then he was busy talking about something deep and weighty and wasn't paying attention to his taste buds.    I feel bad for the sirloin because I think its juxtaposition with the other making-my-eyes-roll-into-the-back-of-my-head dishes didn't do it any favours.   

I also feel bad for other diners in Toronto that night that weren't at Ruby's.  Every time I step into this restaurant, I feel like I'm the much-loved daughter that went off to university and is home for the first time in four months.   The woman when we came in the door, our waitress, the servers who explained our dishes were warm, friendly, funny and informative.  We felt well cared for. It's the kind of place that - if you're open to it - people at other tables will start forgetting themselves and talking to you because we're all so damn giddy on food."}
{"text":"My hubby took me to Ruby last night for my birthday and what a fantastic way to end the day! Overall, the best meal I've had this year (which really is a fun thing to say since the year is only 2.5 weeks old). 

Our menu was very eclectic but delicious. The meal was truly thought out to balance the sweetness from the meats with the right acids and palate cleansers.  Highlights included pork belly in a rich apple-butter sauce, parsnips that were smashed and covered with a salsa verde and the main course, slow roasted pork, with a cornbread chorizo and poached cherry stuffing. 

I'm already a big fan of Grey Owl cheese so was thrilled to see it on our menu. It was served with a golden raisin puree, pickled grapes & toasted almonds. Unfortunately, the pickled grapes got lost in the dish but that didn't detract from the flavours. 

Our dessert was truly out of this world. It was listed as a butterscotch pudding but was so rich and creamy that it was almost like a butterscotch creme.  I can't fully describe the wonders that this pudding gave to us and it was such a perfect complement with what came before.

We chose to have the wine pairings with the first three courses and all three were perfectly matched. The highlight is the wine served with the Grey Owl which on its own was a sweet, heavy almost dessert wine but when paired with the Grey Owl opened up and became lighter in body and fully in flavour.

In the past, when I've gone to other celebrity-chef restaurants, the celebrity is nowhere to be found. That's not the case here. Lyn was in the kitchen, expediting the dishes and making sure they were perfect for each table. The staff all looked to be having a great time which helped make the ambiance that much warmer. 

I highly recommend Ruby Watchco for anyone looking to have a special night out. Even with the volume cranked up (and my hearing being shitty) it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night with a girlfriend, made a reservation only a couple days in advance with no problem. 

All you need to know is the food is great, service was amazing, the pace of the meal was perfect, would definitely come back again.

For 2 of us, we each had dinner, each had a cocktail and one of us had wine, total cost was $190 (taxes & tip in).  I couldn't afford to eat here often, but would def come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The value for the money is amazing. Great for groups as long as you have a cool group that isn't turned off be eating whatever happens to be on the menu. The salads in particular area amazing. So simple but just amazing and well balanced. I've been twice and each time the salad was my favorite even though I thought all the dishes were great. I've also found the service to be really good.  Competent and attentive without being too much. Can't recommend more highly."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight, late seating and still quite busy.
Great meal, would go back.
Enjoyed everything but the price"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Always an excellent experience. Such a great atmosphere and I've always had good servers. 
Not for the picky eaters as it is a set menu and she gets quite creative. 
Drinks are good and have their own twists which is fun. 
Food is excellent. Not every single this I've ever gotten has been excellent but nothing has ever been even close to bad. 
Just a really nice night out and experience. Already planning to come again soon."}
{"text":"Listen, fool. If you've got $50-$100 bucks to drop on a nice dinner - for a special occasion, mayhaps - get your fat butt to Rub Watchco. For serious, though. Ruby Watchco is a revelation. EAT THERE.

You know the background story, right? TV chef Lynn Crawford (Restaurant Makeover, Pitchin' In) is in the driver's seat, and the whole place came to be with the discovery of an old sign that read \"Ruby Watch Co\". She was like, \"man, I gotta do something with this sign. Sho betta open a res-to-rant.\" And she's right - the sign IS something else. I should know, I sat right under it. She's a beaut.

The food is all locally sourced, nothing factory farmed or pumped full of hormones. Love it. The 4-course menu changes daily and beyond dietary restraints, there are no modifications. You will eat what they wanna serve you, and rest assured you will like it. (A note on dietary modifications: they are VERY good at catering to your needs.) They serve the food family style, not individually plated. I think this adds to the restaurant's cozy intimacy; it may be expensive but it definitely doesn't feel hoighty-toighty. You don't have to be fancy, you just have to be willing to EAT.

This was a special dinner for me and because the food is all sustainable, I allowed myself to eat some chicken and dairy in order to get the full RW experience. I still requested no pork or beef, and they pulled off the changes with ultimate grace.

Our menu:

Escarole & Perth Pork Bacon Salad (Brown Butter Croutons, Garden Radishes, Dates,Toasted Walnut Vinaigrette) - Delicious. They made me a separate salad sans bacon and on a normal day, that woulda been my dang dinner. Big!

Crispin Apple Roasted Brick Chicken (Herb Spaetzle & Cremini Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion Sauerkraut, Carron Farm's Red Beets with Pickled Mustard Seeds) - Oh shit, son. Gorgeous. The sauerkraut had bacon in it so they brought me some summer artichokes which were mad tasty. Also, I didn't know what spaetzle was, so our server explained graciously. (It's a tiny pasta that is poached, so has a very light, spongy texture. It was awesome). 

Le Riopelle De L'Isle (Maple Spiced Butternut Squash Butter with Prosciutto Dust) - I haven't had cheese in almost a year so it was an indulgence to say the least to savour some riopelle. They also made me separate squash butter without prosciutto.

Ruby's Chocolate Cherry Mess (Chocolate Meringue, Lake Lee Orchards Vanilla Spiced Cherries, Hewitt's Dairy's Whipped Cream) - F***ing divine. 

So now that I've written an essay, please note my enthusiasm and treat yourself one day. $50 per person (plus drinks if you so desire - the dinner gets exponentially better with dranks). Ruby Watchco is one of those places where the hearty comfort food will appeal to most and nobody will feel uncomfortable in such a homey atmosphere. Our server was fab - every time he described the course, he seemed as if he was conducting an orchestra. The paper towels in the bathroom had RW stamps on them. The playlist included SWV, the Black Keys and N*E*R*D. I am an instant convert. You should be too."}
{"text":"Just go.
Thank me later.

Great, great, great (did I mention great?) service.
Everything (4 courses) tasted awesome.

On paper, the third course was a mystery to me and when the waiter explained it, I was like 'uh... ok' - I thought I would hate it, but goddamn, it was as beautiful as a unicorn riding a mermaid through a waterfall.

Nice vibe and atmosphere added to the experience."}
{"text":"Good food but crappy service. 3 stars to food and 1 star to service.  The staffs show no expression, did not explain the food and it took 20 mins to switch between entree to cheese plate and 20 mins from cheese to dessert.  There is another problem with potion.  We had 6 persons and we got 2 salads to share.  I look over to the next table with 2 persons and they had 1 plate of salad.  This was my 2nd visit and will be my last."}
{"text":"Let's just be honest here, Ruby has the effect of muting your willpower to resist whatever they put in front of you. Don't fight it.

After my meal, I'm convinced I was blessed by the food gods in nabbing a last-minute reservation after calling repeatedly with no return call. (I tip my hat to whoever cancelled, but they really missed out!) 

My understanding is that they're packed solid every night - just as it was for me on a Tuesday night - and it can take some time to get a reservation. 

Don't be discouraged, friends! It's just that this place is small and it's intimacy ultimately produced a really amazing dining experience.

HIGHLIGHTS:

A note about my food allergy (gluten) was on the reservation sheet, and our server asked us once we were seated if there were any allergies. They were 100% accommodating - I didn't feel like I was missing out and I appreciated their attention to it.

The staff generally works together to put out each course. Our server was friendly with a great sense of humour, and extremely attentive with refilling our wine/water glasses to the point were I was quite convinced my glass was bottomless.

The menu is pre-fixe, so you're kept pretty busy with the repeated fantastic event that is receiving a new course. I didn't at any time feel rushed. The plates do come out fairly quickly after finishing each course, so I did take a pause before starting on the cheese plate (3rd course) which was delivered to our table, in order to make some more room for it all - harder to do with the hot courses because you don't want to let things get cold.

Great experience in a warm environment; I left full and contented.... and a little buzzed. Perfect Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Simplicity overpowers any outrageous nouveau culinary style and technique. The result is a fabulously delicious meal. The prix fix menu changes daily and is posted on their website. The main was a perfectly done beef tournedos, we had the decadent optional foie gras, preceded by a fresh salad with an avocado dressing. The cheese course was satisfying, while the chocolate torte was exceptional. Food was excellent and so good without over-trying. Service was very good, as our server Don is a seasoned and personable server. DÃ©cor and ambiance have a hip swankiness. Drinks are really tasty, while wines are plentiful to choose from and not excessive in price.
Next visit will be determined by the daily menu, where something will grab my attention, compelling me to return.
(This is what Canoe should be)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Upon entering we were greeted by friendly hostess and seated just back of the bar. The restaurant itself exudes warmth and coziness, the light from tea candles and fixtures bounce off the brick walls and bathe the dark wood finishes in a soft glow. There is something about this setting that makes you feel familiar and just comfortable (maybe it's just me). Food here is served family style which is either your thing or isn't...for me, I love it! Menu changes daily so good idea to check it out beforehand to ensure you'll enjoy the ingredients they are featuring...we thoroughly enjoyed our meal...was so full afterwards jabba the hut styles man...i totally undid the button on my jeans, yeah, I'll admit it...I ate that much cuz the food was so good. Service was friendly and looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"My friend brought us here for her birthday and the food was so good that I came back for my birthday a few months later. I love the family style serving, so everyone gets as much as they want, no more, no less. And, I've tried items here (like avocado) that normally I don't like, but found them exceptional here."}
{"text":"Like everyone else here has already mentioned, this place is definitely worth checking out! The service is amazing, the food is incredible and the ambiance is chic but laid back.

They have a fixed menu for each night of the week that gets published at the start of the week (Monday I believe). If you are a picky/non-adventurous eater, this may not be the place for you; but if you are feeling adventurous and want to try something that sounds crazy but will change your life, then go here! For example, the dessert I had was garnished with popcorn and bacon - crazy right? Nope, absolutely amazing.

We went here for my birthday and they did a little candle on my dessert which was nice.

Reservations highly recommended! I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I loved my dinner at Ruby Watchco - it takes a certain level of confidence for a restaurant to essentially limit the menu choices of their customers by offering a set chef menu. When you don't really get to choose what you want to eat (other than minor substitutions and for allergies I would assume), you are placing a lot of trust on the chef and it's such a nice experience when they come through. In a weird way it makes the dinner even better, because you didn't get to choose what you ate, but you loved it anyways. 

The portions here are very fair, and you will not leave hungry at all. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely incredible dining experience. My mother is a big fan of Chef Lynn's work from the show and it was great to see the wonderful food in the show mirroring reality last night. Seeing Chef Lynn in action was also reason enough to secure a highly coveted spot at the restaurant. 

From the salad to the veal chops, cheese and delicious dessert we were blown away by the level of culinary skill executed by Chef Lynn and her team. All in all it was a fantastic experience to share with family and friends, and our kind and funny waiter was icing on the cake.

I highly recommend Ruby Watchco for, above all, the excellent food, as well as ambience and overall experience. So much fun!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Love the one menu per day idea.

My first time was for a friend's birthday. We were a group of 10. They were very accommodating and the staffs was very friendly. Lynn Crawford was at the resto. I was pretty excited. Love her on Food network!

My second visit was equally great. Food was spectacular, and, same great service."}
{"text":"I love Lynn Crawford! I love her television show , I love her cookbook and especially love her personality. So it was only natural that when we found out about Ruby Watchco that we wanted to go for dinner.  It wasn't difficult for us to get a reservation.

It was busy but definitely welcoming. We sat near the back with a view of the open kitchen and watched Chef Lynn do her magic.

The food was out of this world delicious. We even met  one Chef Lynn's business partner, Joey Skier who was hands on helping to serve and explain the different courses. 

We blogged about  the details of our meal :

http://tipsareincluded.blogspot.ca/2012/02/ruby-watch-co.html

It  was a memorable dinner and definitely one of those places that I plan to return to soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal tonight so much that it inspired me to write a review.

My boyfriend took me here as part of my birthday present, and it was both our first time at the restaurant. We were running late for our reservation, which was for 6:30 p.m., but the host graciously held our table considering it was a busy Saturday night. The restaurant is a small alcove on Queen St., and the relaxed atmosphere sat with me well. It was nice to be able to hear my date over the music and the chatter of the surrounding tables. The table we had gave a partial view of the kitchen, and I saw Chef Lora Kirk attend to every dish as they came out to the dining room. 

DRINKS:
We opted for cocktails. I don't remember the names, but my boyfriend had one with bourbon, molasses and a bacon rim. He described it as a \"hangover drink\" and he loved it. I loved mine as well, and it had Kraken rum, maple syrup and apple cider.

FOOD:

Smoked Fogo Island Cod Salad - The next time I eat a bad salad, I will think of this dish. It was simple and flavourful and the cod added just the right dimension to it. I enjoyed the cornbread croutons very much, which had the perfect sweetness, crunch and crumble.

Bone Marrow with Bacon Salsa Verde - This was an extra $18, an extravagance we allowed ourselves because hello, it's bone marrow! It came with bread crisps that didn't threaten to break your teeth. This entire dish was beyond what we had expected. The flavours reminded me of something my mom would make - homey, oily, decidedly fatty and meaty.


Grilled Veal Chops with Red Eye Gravy - The veal was tender and fat skirted the meat. The real stars of the show, however, were the sides that accompanied this dish - roasted parsnips and mushrooms, cauliflower and potato gratin, beets and apple slaw with blue cheese dressing. Altogether, this dish was a prize for the tastebuds.

Ten-Year-Old Ottawa Valley Cheddar - This cheese course was a great palate refresher after the previous courses. I'm generally not a fan of olives, but I enjoyed the olive tapenade and honey with the cheese.

June's Almost Famous Carrot Cake - The texture was somewhere between a pound cake and bread pudding, which I found surprising. It was different than any other carrot cake I've tried, and it was delightful. It was coated with coffee frosting and caramel that were just the right amount of sweet!

Overall, this was a pricey meal, but it was such an incredible dining experience that it put Ruby Watchco among our top five favourite restaurants. 10/10 would go again!"}
{"text":"It's sad to write a review like this.  I have heard nothing but great reviews about this place and finally decided to check it out a recent Thursday night.  The place is cute in a great up and coming neighbourhood.  Service was friendly, not overbearing but efficient.  So far so good.  But then the food came.....

It was so.....boring and bland.  When Dining at a restaurant like this, one that has a great deal of buzz and has such great reviews I want to be wowed, but. Sadly it was just ok.  Fresh ingredients, but beyond that no exciting flavors, just oily dressings and under seasoned meat.  

The cheese course was great, but they didn't make the cheese so that doesn't say much about the cooking.  

Desert was surprisingly good, we had heard this was a weak point, but by then we had so many disappointing courses we were just wanting to leave.  

Sorry but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Ruby Watchco (not my favourite name, I have to say, but I won't let it affect my review) is a restaurant co-owned by Lynn Crawford of Food TV fame.  Not that she's just a TV chef - she was exec at Four Seasons.  Anyway, if you're going to this restaurant, you are probably aware of her pedigree.  Moving on!

I reserved a spot for Friday night.  Nobody picked up the call, but the website does warn you that this may happen.  I left a voicemail as instructed and they called me back the next day.  Reservation was set up with no problem.  When we showed up for dinner, I was a bit taken aback by how empty it was.  There were maybe four tables with guests.  It wasn't long before the place was packed, though, so definitely do make reservations for Friday night.  

We interacted with four different servers on the evening.  The first one was the strangest, having a very quiet mannerism and a spaced out way of looking at and talking to you.  A little bit unnerving.  The rest were friendly and more inline with what I expected, except for one who forgot some of the accoutrements on the dish he was describing.  It's a tiny menu, it just seems inconceivable that something can be forgotten.  All in all, service was good but not perfect.

Ruby Watchco serves what I'd call homestyle cooking, served family style.  We started with the green eggs and ham salad.  To put it nicely, the salad was a bit bland, with only the ham providing any real flavour.  The main course was pan seared rainbow trout, with accompanying cauliflower, kale with butternut squash, and a seafood chowder.  This was the highlight of the night to me, with everything cooked expertly and popping with flavour.  The neat thing was we were advised to pour chowder on everything.  I thought the cauliflower was better without the chowder, but the kale/squash acquired an extra dimension.  Delicious!

The cheese course came with plums laced with vanilla, and a rosemary honey.  Again, you can try things in different combinations.  I found the cheese terrific with the honey, but not with the plum.  Dessert was a pear crisp piping hot out of the oven.  Not overly sweet, but well balanced and a nice end to the meal.

Overall, my companion and I had a pleasant time.  You won't leave hungry, but just know that you're not getting anything particularly exciting when it comes to the food.  To be honest, I'm a little torn between three and four stars.  It's not that Ruby Watchco is bad, it's just that when stacked up to others in this price range, it might turn out to be only average.  But I'll give an extra half star for the value of it (lots of food!) and a lukewarm recommendation."}
{"text":"I have been to eat at Ruby Watchco twice and had an excellent dining experience both times. You get a coursed meal here and you are eating what they are serving that night. I am an adventurous eater, however the food here is so amazing you don't have to worry about not liking anything they serve you. The first time I was here they were serving meat, which I was not eating at the time and they were happy to offer me salmon instead - something I wasn't expecting and very impressed by. 

For the most part everything is served family style (at least for the main course) and the portions of food are very generous. Coming with a friend, we were unable to finish everything! Coming with a boyfriend, he left very full! 

I love the wine selections they carry including one of my favourite Niagara region wineries - Lailey which is not available for purchase through LCBO.

Great service, great space. I feel that the price point is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Where to begin??  This place is kind of kooky!  Maybe it was because we were there with our college aged kids?. Maybe because we asked about the significance of the name \" Ruby  Watcho\" ?   It was like attending a family party at your aunt's home.  Imagine that she went to the farmer's market that morning, worked all day on a fabulous menu, paired it with some great local wines and called in the cousins to help serve.  By the way, did I mention that your aunt is a talented chef, who has a cozy, rustic yet chic place?   The whole experience was delicious & unique, with attentive, professional and, somewhat sassy service.  

We were in a few weeks ago but I am still remembering our Ruby Watchco experience as a fun night with great comfort food, good wine and great service!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends to celebrate a friend who was getting married. This restaurant was outstanding for service and food, and even went the extra mile.

Service - we were a group of 10 which is a bit of a hard number and the tables really seat up to 8 and you need at least 12 for the private room, but he restaurant went ahead and accommodated out group size, which was very hospitable of them. The service throughout dinner was very attentive too.

Food - outstanding! The menu that night was varied and interesting - beet salad, chicken cacciatore, goat cheese with spicy/sweet mango sauce, and Black Forest cake. A quick note about the chicken and the cake: these are items that I grew up eating and never associated with a fine dining experience. I was wrong. The chef's take on both (and the salad and the cheese) were new, exciting, and bold while staying true to the original flavours. The side dishes, and I particular the sweet mashed potato, were incredible. My mouth is still watering.

Extra mile. Coming to the restaurant I left my phone in a taxi. The bartender was super cool and she let me borrow her phone to use the \"find my phone\" function and followed up with me to make sure that I had gotten my phone and also that my evening was great overall. Really outstanding service that went above and beyond.

If you live in Toronto do yourself a favour and go here!"}
{"text":"Once again, Ruby Watchco has wowed us with another delicious dinner.  Every dish had depth, full of flavors, wonderful textures and balanced.

Ruby's Corn Cobb Salad was divine!  The best cobb salad I have ever had.  The smokiness of the bacon and sweetness from the corn, so good!
[Sleger's Living Greens, Romaine Hearts, Bacon, Hen Egg, Tomato, Aged Cheddar, Green Goddess, Brown Derby Vinaigrette]

The most yummy part about the Pan Seared Steelhead Trout was the skin.  It was palatable, savory and, oh yes, crispy.  We loved the Ratatouille trimmings.  Brown butter roasted cauliflower was aromatic, smoky and sweet.  I also loved the fingerling potatoes with olive relish and carrot slaw with creamy tartar dressing, and how they complimented the trout.

When I first saw the dessert, Chocolate Berry Fool, Dark Chocolate, Summer Berries, Candied Hazelnuts.  I didn't know what to think.  But let me tell you, it was out of this world!  It reminded me a little bit of black forrest cake, but a thousand time better.  Rich without being too chocolaty. 

Staff were friendly and attentive as always."}
{"text":"My husband took me there few times for special occasion! 
We are big fun of Chef Lynn Crawford and she won't disappoint at you.

We keep coming back this place because they consistently giving us amazing service, food, and atmosphere. It may ended up a bit pricey but who care at this point?
After you tried their food, you wouldn't care....

They also have awesome beer selection.
Can't complaint at all."}
{"text":"We had the parsnip salad and added the beef carpaccio with fried pickles to start. The whipped feta and the dressing on the salad were the main stars. 
The Pineapple Express cocktail was very refreshing. 

The main was Brick chicken it came with sweet potatoes (pictured), roasted green eggplant and lemon broccoli. 
 
The grilled pear paired nicely with the cheese. 

Finally it was all finished off with a lemon delight(pictured) which was an organized chaos of lemon related desserts."}
{"text":"We visited Ruby WatchCo on a Saturday.  It's a set menu, so we had a squash salad , grilled hanger steak, cheese plate, and carrot cake.  Everything is served family style (except the carrot cake - and we were happy about that!)

The squash salad was delicious.. great textures with the almonds and fried shallots.

The steak was cooked perfectly - they were very accommodating with different cook temperatures on the steaks and ended up serving ours individually.  It was served with asparagus, beets, and mashed potatoes - all done wonderfully

The cheese plate had 3 different types of cheeses which were all very good.. for the people complaining about it being 3 pieces of cheese... at this point we were so stuffed, we would not be able to eat anymore.

The carrot cake... AMAZING.. very moist, not too sweet! 

This was a great meal, the reason they are not getting 5 stars is because 1. they charge for water which I think is odd and 2. their wine selection is not what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. 

Go for the food!"}
{"text":"Far more than 5 stars!!!!  Anyone who cooks or appreciates fresh local ingredients will love Ruby Watchco. You can even see chef Lynn herself helping out, serving and greeting guests. All around one of the most enjoyable meals ive ever had!"}
{"text":"I cannot think of a better way to celebrate just about anything, than with a dinner at Ruby Watcho. If it was up to me, I'd be dining here daily but for the time being, it will remain a special occasion establishment. Hopefully not for long! 

Ruby Watcho is an easygoing restaurant that packs a serious punch. We made 7:30 reservations the night before and it was no problem. Immediately when we came in, we were greeted by an owner, Joey. He was wonderful to talk to, so funny as we got settled in. We ordered a bottle of wine and were asked about any allergies. My roommate disclosed again that she was vegetarian. No meat? No fish? No problem! These guys are not going to turn you away; they're here to help. 

From start to finish, it was exceptional. Expectations are thrown out the window when a huge plate of salad appears. Reading the menu I was not sure what to anticipate: marinated red and yellow peppers, red watercress, romaine hearts, pecorino, fried capers, candied olives, spiced almonds and a basil vinaigrette. With so many things were happening on one plate, I wasn't sure how it would turn out. This just proves to be another reason why I am not a chef. Lynn has the vision! The salad was fresh and vibrant with that basil dressing. The peppers were a soft and slippery bite. The lettuces were unlike any I've seen before, seemingly straight from the garden, just missing roots. Then the olives, capers and almonds added a salty, spicy, sweet element that made each bite completely different while adding that crunch. As for pecorino cheese, well, you really can't go wrong with the generous shavings. 

The pace of the meal is nice and steady. They let you take your time and give you the right breaks to digest. So after that heap of salad, we were ready to see what was next. The main meat was a slow roasted leg of lamb with walnut and mint pesto. It was perfectly cooked and juicy, with two \"streaks\" of it all for me! The pesto was a great addition, for the minty freshness that complimented it so. Sides were equally up to snuff. Lemon scented fingerling potatoes with thyme were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sliced down the middle. Also there was sauteed rapini with a cherry tomato vinaigrette that was mustard-y and delectable, alongside a refreshing cucumber and red onion salad in a goat yogurt dressing. Lynn knows her salads! 

Next was the cheese course, which oddly enough was what we were most excited for. I mean, I love cheese. It's not every day that someone caters so specifically to my adoring respect for cheese. And yet, here it was: a wedge of comfort cream with an apple herd salad drizzled with truffled honey. As the waiter set it down and described the dish, he shrilled, \"WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!\" and it was hilarious. The whole restaurant and staff can be my truffled honeys. Apple and herbs (dill?) is a pairing that I don't see every day and it was SO good with the cheese. Getting everything on the grilled bread alongside was key and perfect. 

You would think we'd be bursting at this point but we actually managed to keep it together by only taking one serving for each of the main dishes. Finally, dessert time included a espesso cheesecake with Bailey's caramel sauce. Yes, it was tasted exactly as it sounds AKA amazing. It was a very rich dessert which I could only handle a few bites of but it was wonderful end to the meal that we gladly took home to enjoy later. 

At this point, we felt like we are best friends with Joey and he tells us we should go visit Lynn Crawford who is actually on site, in her chef gear, helping out here and there in the kitchen. We went over and she could not be any nicer, talking to us for several minutes, asking up about our experience, even school and summer plans. We took a picture with LC because we're cool like that and then left on the biggest high. 

Counting down the days until I return!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience to be had at Ruby Watchco. Chef Lynn Crawford even signed the cookbook I purchased and served me my food. Great, interactive place. The food is top-notch! The menu is set and may be out of some people's comfort zone but it's worth it to try something new and tasty!"}
{"text":"Although Ruby Watchco does not need another five-star review, I have to express how impressed I am. 

We were seated promptly for our 8:30PM reservation by a very friendly hostess. The seating was pretty cramped as it's not a very large establishment. The table for two was thankfully big enough to snuggly fit all items on the menu. 

What I loved:
1. Everyday serves a different menu - you're able to check it out on their website prior to your visit. 
2. Family-style dining experience - this is romantic if you're a couple on a date or if you're the type who can never finish what's on your plate. Everything at Ruby's is great for sharing!
3. The servers are hilarious. They love their jobs and have such an upbeat personality you can't help but smile as they sashay down from the kitchen with your food, singing along with whatever's playing on the restaurant's CD. 

The food:
1. Chicken Liver Pate was heavenly! For $16.00 extra, it was so worth it. I smeared it on everything. 
2. The roasted beef wasn't as rare as I'd like it, but still surprisingly tender although it looks well-done. The Yorkshire pudding is hard to chew, and didn't mash so well with the gravy. 
3. The mushroom medley on the side was my favorite! So much flavor and zest - I wish they serve this in the future because this dish seals the deal! 
4. The dessert - dark chocolate cake - was also delicious. It's served in a little mason jar, and topped with whipped cream. 

There's really nothing negative to say about Ruby Watchco except that Chef Crawford wasn't there during my visit (and parking is hard to find). There will be next time!"}
{"text":"Watch out for Ruby Watchco!!!

Ruby Watchco is a great spot for a less ordinary dinner.
The food is fresh.  It's like going to someone's house and having them make you a fantastic dinner.

The food may not be fancy, but the trendy exposed brick venue and excellent service makes if feel like a fancy experience...except for it's a cramped space and you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor.

I really liked the concept, a fixed price meal and set menu (which changes daily).   The menus for the week are posted online.

I've heard some people dislike the idea that you can only eat what is offered that day
...That's the whole point.

In fact, next time I go, I'm not even checking out the menu online first! So, it will be a complete surprise!

You have severe allergies? You are a fussy eater? 
You know what? That's okay.  
But, don't dine here.

The price is very reasonable for a four course meal.
$49 for a meal prepared with local, organic, fresh produce supporting our local farmers is fantastic.

Family style serving.  So, be prepared to pass the potatoes!

* The cheese biscuits were delicious!!! They were super buttery. I wish I could have more of them.
* I did find the salads salty but interesting.  Melon and beets are always a good mix.
* Fingerling potatoes sounded boring but were crisp and deliciously seasoned.
* The main was Salmon, the portions were large, juicy and perfectly cooked.
* The cheese platter was alright, cheese made in Quebec by monks.
  Good if you like blue cheese.
* Dessert was apricots and almond cookies.  The cookies were delicious, I wish there were more cookies and less apricots! 

I'm definitely going to revisit and let dinner be a surprise! :)"}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at Ruby Watchco last night. All I can say is amazing! The food was sooo good. I love the \"this is the menu today\" philosophy. No decisions, just good eats! If you are a picky eater, I don't recommend this place but for the non-picky eaters who enjoy delicious food, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were able to get reservations 3 hours before we wanted to arrive, so that was exciting. It's a small, very dark restaurant on Queen East. Street parking is free right outside the restaurant (free after 6pm in that area) so that is a huge bonus. I little bit better lighting would be nice, I would like to see my food a bit more than I could, but that is a minor detail. Seats were comfortable and we were fortunate to have an actual table for 2, and not have to share at one of those large, long tables.

Fixed menu, food served family style. This is no secret and they tell you on the website and when you arrive they explain how it works. Unless you have a massive appetite, the 4 course set menu is more than enough food. They have the option of 2 additional add ons to the menu for an additional cost, but I truly cannot figure out who one each could have physical room in their stomach for them. 

We had rack of pork in a maple vinaigrette with raisins, smashed sweet potatoes with pecan granola, glazed carrots, charred broccoli in garlic butter, started with a kale panzanella salad and then a cheese plate with a tiny amount of Grey Owl that was very, very pungent finished by gingerbread cheesecake with cranberry jam for desert. We had a local beer and a lovely rose from Northern France that matched the meal perfectly. As it was our anniversary, our server upgraded my wine order and comped an addition glass part way through the meal even though I protested. That was a very kind gesture and he was handsomely compensated in our tip. They put 2 little candles in our dessert for our anniversary and both servers wish us Happy Anniversary and were extremely friendly, competent, warm and fun! The servers really make this experience, and the staff seems to be quite happy and very competent.

My complaints are few, but worth nothing. One is the food temperature, nothing was very warm and I was tempted to send back the dinner to have it heated properly. I like my food hot, not tepid like bath water that has sat too long. Particularly meat, that should be hot, like piping hot and steaming! The layer of fat around the pork chop need just a bit more cook as it could have been a little crispy and over-the-top delicious, but it was a bit under cooked, sticky and turned my stomach. 

The side dishes were all good, except the broccoli that was barely cooked so that was disappointing. For 2 people, the sides are just barely enough considering the price of the meal and what you get in other restaurants. They should reconsider the amount of vegetables they serve, add a few extra pieces, it won't cost much, and ensure they are hot when carried out of the kitchen. The kitchen was maybe 12 feet from our table, so I'm not sure why the food could not be served hot.
 
The dessert was amazing. I think the salad and the buttermilk biscuit and the dessert were my favourite parts of the meal. The amazing wine was above and beyond the best part of my entire experience! 

The servers are very friendly and they encourage you to go back and talk to Lynn Crawford, and she was there the night we went. However, Lynn Crawford really is not that friendly at all, and even just saying \"hello, we enjoyed our meal, the food was delicious\" seemed like we were really bothering her, like truly being a huge pain in the ass. So for that reason, I struggled to give this restaurant a 4 or 5. If Lynn doesn't want patrons to speak to her, she should tell her wait staff the because the told us many times to \"go on back and say hello\". 

The Lynn we saw at the restaurant was nothing like the friendly, outgoing, boisterous, laughing person you see on TV on Pitching In or any other show I have seen her on. That part was really disappointing to me. I have admired her cooking for years and just wanted to say hello and have a quick 30 second chat, maybe a photo, but she was sending off a serious \"F-off and die\" vibe through the daggers in her eyes. I should never have bothered and then I could have remained delusional thinking she was the friendly, laughing character she is on TV.

Not cool, Lynn, really not cool at all. 

I don't think we will be back. It's a \"been there, done that\" type of experience, and her cool reception really left us with a bad vibe. It's just far too much money to spend to be left feeling that way and to be served luke warm food."}
{"text":"Located in a very cool and eclectic part of Toronto. I was lucky enough to enjoy the chef's menu and wow, was it delicious. The light fare tasted so fresh and the heavier (steak with beets) was cooked to perfection. Well made dishes, in my opinion, are those which allow the flavor of the food speak for itself, without over dressing it. Ruby's has done just that: simple food, made well, with complimentary sides and sauces. The wine selection was also well-paired and showcased some impressive Canadian wines (who knew? ;)). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went there last night. Before I came, I called them several days before to make a reservation and told them that day is my bf's birthday. Then the waitress ignored what I said just confine the time. On that day, we didn't get any \"happy birthday\" on the dessert. The food is ok. However, after I paid for the bill, the waitress just put the recepit on the table and said \"here you are.\" I smiled to her and said thank you, but she didnt say anything. Maybe she is not satisfied with the tips(I did not give her less than 15% tips). But I think she should at least say thank you to customers after we paid the bill."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends on Tuesday, August 11th when the menu included: Welsh Bros' Corn Salad; Grilled Veal Chops with Arugula & Parmesan Salad (sides: cauliflower, snap peas and crushed new potatoes); Sweet Breads, Grey Owl (Goats Cheese); and Warner's Farms Raspberry Clafoutis. We also added an order of Zucchini Florets, which were my favourite part of the meal, along with the Corn Salad and the Cauliflower. Absolutely everything was delicious and it was nice having a family style meal out with friends and not having to spend time pondering over the menu, when you'd rather be catching up and chatting. 

Our server was great, very entertaining and in no way overbearing. They didn't have the wine we wanted so he brought out 2 great alternatives and said he would make the more expensive option the same price as the bottle we had originally wanted (so we obviously got that one). All in all it was all a wonderful experience, and I am looking forward to returning and trying out another menu!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here for my birthday dinner. Upon arrival, the hostess was very warm and welcoming while she guided us to our table. Throughout the night, we were taken care of by their friendly staffs. Ambience was great as we sat close to the \"Ruby Watchco\" banner which was perfect for a photo. It was really busy for a Wednesday as we saw multiple parties and a private event upstairs as well. I like their unique concept of having different set menus each day of the week; therefore, you would make your reservation accordingly to what you like. 

On tonight's menu (4 course meal), we had:

1) Carron Farm's Red Beet Salad - this dish was fresh full of flavours

2) Slow Roasted Leg of Lamb with Minted Cucumber Yogurt - it was too chewy for my liking. On the upside, it was accompanied by lots of side dishes. I was getting full by this point..

3) Artisanal Cheese - it was quite an interesting way of having cheese as I've never had it this way before

4) Brownie and Strawberry Fool - it came with vanilla cream and caramel. Taste exactly like how you would imagine it to be

Overall, flavour of food can be better. The set pricing for their menu was fair. I am still interested in coming back to try their other unique set menus."}
{"text":"If I was a King (or Queen) I would dine here everyday!

I was looking for something different for dinner and discovered Richie S. and Tong J.'s reviews for Ruby Watch Co.  Two of my favourite Yelpers both had good things to say about this place, so I got in my car and sped over there.  

We were worried they wouldn't seat us because we arrived right around their official closing time - I know, we're jerks.

We asked if we could still have dinner there, and they didn't have a problem with that at all.  The restaurant was still full of diners.  The hostess went to the kitchen to check that they still had enough food to serve us and came back with a thumbs up.

Totally confused: We were asked if we wanted the full dinner menu or the partial.  Due to it being close to closing time, we decided on the partial.  The hostess told us we would then have to be seated at the bar.  Confusion explanation to be continued...

We took our seats at the bar and ordered cocktails.  I chose something that I feared would be too sweet, but the lovely bartender, Sarah, made it especially not too sweet for me.  It was delicious!  I can't remember what was in it, but it was very original, and thanks to her skills, not too sweet.

Interesting: they create their own horseradish-infused vodka for Caesars.  The bartender told us you avoid getting horseradish in your teeth this way.

The food just started coming out - family style.  The salad was gigantic, but so good I couldn't let any of it go to waste.  The bread and butter were fantastic as well.

Then - the main dish....  a baked chicken in a red wine reduction sauce, served with scalloped potatoes, broccoli cooked in lemon butter and heirloom carrots.  This was definitely the most memorable dish, maybe because I ate leftovers for the next 2 days.  I think we were served an entire chicken, which is a little excessive for just 2 people.  Add to that big side dishes and remember they've already stuffed us with big appetizers.

Totally confused (part 2): so here I am thinking, if we were being served the so-called partial menu, what does one get for the full menu?  2 full chickens?  I had to ask the waitress to explain the insanity.  She explained that we were getting the full menu!  Ahhh... it all made sense.  Still too much food, but at least they don't normally give even more than that.

After the chicken came a cheese plate, served with crostinis.  Then came dessert....  I can't even remember what it was because I was so stuffed.  It was definitely good though because I remember licking my dessert plate!  Sarah (bartender/waitress) also made me a delcious latte to go with it.

This is a true dining experience.  Not only did our waitress treat us like royalty, every single other person working there was extremely nice to us.  I especially liked how the dishes were explained to us as they were brought out.  And they were all brought out in the cutest little red dishes.  The service was so good (they kept changing our cutlery and plates) that I would normally feel out of place - not knowing how to be polite...  Except at Ruby, they're so friendly you don't worry about any of that!

Definitely pricey, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Fun, light-hearted staff, exceptional food, and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Review: 4.5
I have been a fan of Chef Lynn Crawford for many years and only just heard about Ruby Watchco recently. We were lucky enough to have her there personally last Friday night for dinner. She personally served us our salad dish and was frequently seen checking on other customers and filling drinks.
Meal: 4
Our salad dish was delicious. It was their winter chopped salad with a creamy mint dressing, and came with biscuits. The biscuits were so good! They were so flavourful that we didn't need to add any seasoning or butter.
We added the Beef Carpaccio ($16) which was one of our favourite dishes of the night. I can't remember the particular garnishes that were added to it but it made for a perfect combination of tastes and textures.
My other favourite dish was the cheese dish - a Chevre noir with sprouts, coriander seeds, basil dressing and nuts. I personally could have eaten this dish the entire night  it was so good!
The dessert was warm-baked blondies which were also, of course, delicious.
The only reason I'm not rating the food with a 5 was because of the main dish of the night. It was halibut with a variety of side dishes. Unfortunately it was only okay, and quite forgettable for me.
Ambiance: 4
Service: 5
Very attentive servers, all knowledgeable about the food being served that night. All helpful and friendly.
All in all, I would definitely come back another time. The main deterrent is the price ($50 before tax for the prix fixe meal only, $39 for wine pairings) so save this for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"What can I say here that hasn't already been said?  

The food, service and atmosphere were all phenomenal. Family style servings is a refreshing and original concept and it works because quite frankly that woman could serve me anything and I'm confident I would eat it and love it. 

Chef Lynn is tour de force in the kitchen.
This really was an exceptional experience."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to eat... The ambience is warm, cozy, light, and welcoming. The decor has a harmonious flow, and not too over the top. The food, consistent in quality and taste. The courses are well planned. The ingredients are honest and chef Lynn adheres to her standard in texture, flavour, temperature, presentation, and smell of every course. 

To top it off? The service is friendly, attentive, and pleasant. 

Chef Lynn is exactly what she appears to be on her shows: frank, humourous, and real. She is a true Canadian talent."}
{"text":"Amazing

Check ahead to make sure u like everything on the menu, as they have one set meal they serve everyone, that changes each night. Its not the kind of place you go every weekend, but for a special occasion its great.
 They even offer wine pairings with each dish, but dont look at you funny for ignoring them and drinking what you want.

Its a set price $50 per person. 
But omg 
Delicious, and big portions!
The additional sides arent necessary.
We had the venison shanks. That were about 8\" wide and as long as my forearm, each.
Shes a very talent chef

The reason i knocked one star off, isnt even a real complaint because i recognise that with a place like this you have to do things a certain way
Like... The restaurant does 2 sittings a night. 
And even though i loved the venison shanks, i cant go back and have them again, because the menu changes every night."}
{"text":"I went here a while ago and forgot to give it a review then.  Although I don't remember the exact items on the fixed menu that day, I do remember everything from the service, food, presentation, decor and atmosphere of the place to be amazing.  Their dessert that day was exceptional.  The pricing is also great considering the quality of the food.  Chef Lynn Crawford even came out to serve a dish to another table to apologize for it being late."}
{"text":"The experience and the food was excellent. 

I loved the fact that you could see Lynn Crawford working away checking everything that went out of the kitchen. 

I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  I'm not a huge fan of the set dinner concept but I do have confidence that the menu will be delicious for most.  I had a salad with cheese buns, trout with fennel & potatoes, bitter cheese with eggplant, and what I think was a really sour tart for dessert.  I can't say I loved every single item but for the most part, I think this was a great meal for the price.  The food was a tad salty and the trout didn't blow me out of the water but for the most part, you will appreciate the high quality ingredients used that are fused together in a modern, eclectic twist."}
{"text":"Second time here, this time with a friend. 

Pros:

- those chive scones continue to be a winner, don't ever take them off the menu!
- starter salad was delicious, layered with many perfectly suited ingredients and not overly dressed like so many other places
- potato side dish was great: homestyle, creamy and an overall winner
- carrot cake had a rich almost molasses quality to it, decadent end to meal

Cons

- biggest con was steak was raw to the point of chewy tendons and parts had to be spat out. Which is a shame because the mushroom sauce accompaniment was amazing. I get overcooking a steak is a crime but they've swung way too much the other way here. Seriously it was blue raw. Medium rare would have done wonders for this main dish
- broccoli and another smaller side salad for testing steak were ho hum and close to what you could whip up at home
- meal is pricey: with cocktails, coffees and tip was $200 for 2. Given the price points it just seems chintzy to charge for water especially with no warning. $5 americanos also steep. These are prices approaching \"event type\" restaurants with luxurious decor etc so seems out of whack for a homey neighborhood style place

Service was neutral, a little cool but efficient. I'd probably go back but this is definitely a splurge type place. I really feel the east end needs some more competition from top-notch restaurants like on Queen or King West. Ruby Watchco is probably the best on this side of town but it needs some real competition to keep it on its toes. As an east-ender myself I think the reflexive defending of so many mediocre restaurants along this strip by locals (I'm talking about you Peasant Table, Aft, County General, Skin and Bones, Braised, the list goes on and on) is preventing the innovative and epic meals you can get on the other side of town. Big sigh that the New Broadview Hotel's kitchen will be Peasant Table/Table 17 guys :( We deserve better!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise, although this is family style the ambience is warm and inviting.  The food was plentiful and delicious as we paired it withv their wine suggestions.

Your dinner ends with a lovely glass  of Port.
Don't be shy about engaging with the wait staff, you will be rewarded with friendly humour.  Class act!!

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nicklebrook & Ruby Watcho dinner pairing event, top notch !

Just have to say thank you to both Ruby Watcho & Nicklebrook Brewery for an exceptional night out!

It was a special evening for us, as we were hosting our store Manager and his lovely wife to a celebratory birthday dinner out...

A special shout out to Mary, at Ruby Watchco, for being so friendly & helpful when we were getting our tickets!

From the time we were greeted upon arriving, to the outstanding beer sommelier knowledge from the chap at Nicklebrook, and the amazing descriptions from our chef Lara, not a detail was missed, and both the beer and the food was perfectly paired! 

The food, the beer, the atmosphere, the beer sommelier, the chef, everything,  we had a great time, and this was our first time here!!

Thank you again Ruby Watchco :)"}
{"text":"Overall a decent meal but didn't live up to the hype. 

After reading so many reviews and Chef Lynn Crawford being one of my favorite Food Network personalities, I made it known to my boyfriend that I wanted to try Ruby Watchco. Because I don't eat beef, we waited for a menu that didn't serve beef and just by coincidence, for our birthday dinner, the menu entree on the website was Black Cod. 

When we got there, we found out that they changed the entree to Halibut instead of Black Cod of which to me, a fish lover was a huge difference. But nonetheless, I wanted to try it. 

The whole dinner is a family style dinner in which we share every dish. 

We were first served a farm fresh spring mix and beans salad of which was not very spectacular as there basically wasn't any dressing at all, or so it tasted like that anyways. There were way too much beans and not enough greens. 

We then were served beets topped with chorizo bits, garlic mash and our entree, the Halibut filets. While the portions were good, the food was just mediocre to be honest. Everything was very fresh but just not very flavorful and pretty plain in my opinion. The best part of the entree was the chorizo and beets which to my surprise was sweet and savory. The halibut was well cooked and flaky but there wasn't enough pesto sauce for the piece of fish. 

A rhubarb and goat cheese plate came next and the combination just wasn't our thing so we skipped to dessert which was a chocolate panna cotta in a mason jar. It was nice that they remembered our birthdays and have us a candle. The panna cotta was good. The portion was huge and I couldn't even finish. 

All in all, for a restaurant run by a top chef, I just expected more food that would stir my tastebuds but unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. 

Because the menu does change weekly and daily, I would go back to try a different menu and give it another shot. Service was very good though although they were busy, I didn't feel like they forgot about us."}
{"text":"I love you Chef Lynn!

This place is awesome. The atmosphere and vibe suck you in....the food makes you smile....the servers make you laugh....and before you know it, you've been there for 2 hours. 

Everything Chef Lynn makes is delicious. Everything. EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Yes, two stars down from 3. I'm still not sure what the excitement is.  I think it is more self proclaimed then reality. I can see by the number of vacant seats I am not the only one with this thought. Tonight Jennifer and I had the hanger steak which was tasty but served COLD after a long wait, and of course they serve everything family style. It was only enough food for one not two, with so little food you had to count the pieces.  When I think of family style I expect generous portions, that's not what you will find here. They are trying hard to be high end, maybe they should can the \"family style\" service. The carrots were very nice and the broccoli was perfectly cooked. One course consisted of a piece of goat cheese the size of a dime on a equally sized dab of Smuckers Jam, I passed on this course. The salad and dressing was quite good, I like the deep fried pickles, this was a first for me. Would I go back? No.  Too complicated for the quality of the food. First you would have to go on a night you like the menu being offered that evening. They have specific sitting times, you have to be there at 6 pm or 8 pm and you have no choice outside the selected menu. The service was just ok. I'm not accustom to having a waitress leaning over my table waiting for me to empty my plate so she can take it away. The bill for two came to $150 and that is with one single glass of wine not two. If you want a steak, go to the Keg, half the price and double the portion and while I am not a fan of the Keg, this place/meal makes the Keg look good."}
{"text":"Seriously. I was blown away. In one shot this surged up my list to be added into my top 5 Toronto restaurants. Made reservations on Wednesday. The only time available was 9pm on Friday, but that's was fine for me. Maybe call more in advance if you're more picky about what time you eat. And can I also say THANK GOD to restaurants that take reservations!?! Since this resto is way out of my normal path, I wouldn't have made the trek if I hadn't been able to make a reservation. And that would have been a shame.

We started with cheese biscuits. I died they were so good. DIED. Crumbly and flakey and salty. 5 year cheddar in those babies. 

I was a bit stunned to see Lynn Crawford in the house. I find sometimes \"celeb\" chefs aren't in their restaurants, merely lending their name, but she was there, and was putting up with everyone wanting to take a picture with her. (I wanted to, but the boy wouldn't let me!)

The courses that followed were fresh, delicious, and filling! Don't worry about leaving here hungry, because you won't. In fact I walked away feeling uncomfortably full. Maybe you have better self control than I do. The main course that was served B.C. salmon, and it was beautiful.

Dessert was a chocolate brownie with caramel and strawberry cream. Ohmygawd.

Service was friendly and funny, cocktails were strong. I bought a cookbook (and had it signed). I left a little giddy.

Go."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Perhaps our expectations were too high after reading all the good reviews and perhaps they were having an off night - but for the cost of our two meals plus wine pairing it was quite underwhelming. Yes there were a few interesting tastes in both the opening salad and the Earl Grey Tea panna cotta dessert. Yes the cheddar cheese biscuits were lovely. But additional starter of chicken liver pate was not as good as our own homemade version. Nor did the boring cod fish and side dishes of cabbage and lentils and cheese course redeem the meal. Service was okay, not stellar. Am I wrong to expect stellar for $200 plus?"}
{"text":"Had my first dinner (but most definitely not last!) at Ruby last evening with two friends. Everything that all of the other reviewers state is true, so I won't feel the need to rehash. 

Spot on service, beautiful atmosphere, amazing drink menu (loved the prosecco cocktail with pinot noir syrup and concord grape juice!) as well as a glass of the perfectly paired wine of the day. 

Menu was a cobb salad with biscuits and home made butter; Flank Steak, Roasted Cauliflower, mashed potatoes, cheese course with amazing house made orange and carrot marmalade and chocolate banana bread pudding. 

Great food! 

A word about Chef Lynn- we were lucky enough to be seated near the back of the dining room, near the kitchen. We were able to watch Lynn expedite with style, grace and charm and were then lucky enough to be served by Lynn. We were three guys, and commented that if we needed more steak to just let her know. (As it turns out, we had leftovers from the original serving that we took home.) She sets the tone for the restaurant, generously interacting with her staff (all of whom were friendly, professional and schooled on the menu.) 

Near the end of the meal, we chose to not order the special after dinner cocktail being offered with the bread pudding- chocolate grappa. When Lynn noticed that we were not having the drink, she went to the bar, got the bottle and three glasses and poured as a shot while asking her sommilier to come over and explain to us how the grappa was made. She also generously complimented her sommilier, saying she was a rising star on the Toronto scene and that the restaurant was lucky to have her. 

I've been lucky this trip to Toronto- Canoe, George, Terroni... All very good experiences. But Ruby Watchco will be on the top of my recommendation list and my personal repeat list."}
{"text":"As a celebrity chef owned restaurant of under 100 seats, Ruby Watchco should be a no brainer for excellent food. I didn't even bother to research reviews before booking.
Great room and excellent front end staff but you know, the food was okay.
I have no problem with no menu choice, eat what you are served but at $49 a sitting it better well be damn good, okay blow me away Lynne. It was okay.
The side dishes were tasty but kind of dead, the way food dies if it is not served fresh from the oven or skillet or grill. Come on you only have one dish to serve and the dining room does not have to be \"picked up\" all at once. 
The best chefs train on cruise ships or hotels where they learn the art of presenting a large number of high quality plates in a short period of time. What's up with this place?
Food costs must be very low 20%? so $49 is no bargain. The food is okay. The markup on the bar is very high.
Lynne must be riding the high of the community buzz and laughing all the way to the bank.
It was \"okay\"."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in any Toronto restaurant. Ruby Watchco serves to impress with customers desiring more!  Everything about our meal was 10+++!

We called middle of the week for Friday night reservation and luckily got an early seating. Cocktail and beer selection is fantastic. Our drinks arrived quickly and it was off to start the salad course. We also added the Terrine dish so really enjoyed the starters. The corn bread was also to die for!  So fresh and buttery...

Our salmon dish along with green bean, bak choy, and potato sides were all cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the family style. 

Lynn Crawford was helping with water refills, wine glasses and chatting with the Tables. It was great to see her helping everyone out and paying close attention to the dishes being served.

Dessert was a delicious maple creme, with the best blueberries I have ever tasted.

It was the best quality meal and service we have received for $49pp. Can't wait to go back for another meal!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! My husband and I came here for our wedding anniversary last night and really enjoyed the food here. It was a great dining experience. I really like the idea of having a set meal in place that everyone in the restaurant gets to experience together. Things that you may not order usually you get to try, which makes it feel like a true dining adventure. I think we've found the restaurant we want to go to every wedding anniversary now!"}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night with my husband. By 8:45 the restaurant was nearly full. I suggest making a reservation. 

The atmosphere was a bit on the loud side, but I wasn't drinking so maybe it seemed louder than it was. The service was excellent, the food was, for the most part, excellent.

They do a fixed 4 course menu, with some optional courses. (A buretta appetizer, a cod entree )

We had:

Beet salad - 5/5 this was perfection garnished with crispy beets and grapefruit.

Chicken - 3/5 it was a bit dry for me and the meat was slightly bland without the sauce. However the sauce was incredible. (My husband thought this dish was a 5)

Sides: leek and tomato - 5/5 I loved this 

Smashed potato - 3/5

Cabbage slaw - 5/5 

Desert:

Banana Nutella tart - 5/5 so creamy and decadent. We split one and took the other one home . 

 I love the emphasis on healthy, organic, local food at Ruby Watcho and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm speechless.  And in the most delightful food coma - can one get drunk on food?  Ruby Watchco might be one of the most pleasing dining experiences I've ever had.  Why?  The food is just made with love.  The place oozes a calm, confident generosity that makes you want to stay all night (although that could be the four course meal talking).  

Waitstaff are that great combination of funny, down-to-earth, attentive (but not overbearing) and knowledgeable.  They anticipated my every want (more water?  Thank you!  Another buttery chive biscuit?  Don't mind if I do!)  Our server took extra care with everything.  Case in point - as she placed our first course plates on the table, she must have noticed that one wasn't spotless.  Without a word (or a beat), she went to get another one so everything would be perfect.  That while cracking jokes about (and with) her fellow servers.  I guess I would also be that warm and happy if I got to eat those biscuits every day.

Drinks:  Fabulously delicious margarita.  Fresh lime and elderflower with a sweet/salt rim that was a revelation.  They blend rock salt and rock sugar on the rim so that you first get a hit of salt (because they dissolve at different speeds) and then it's immediately followed by a hit of sweetness.  Beautiful.  

Dinner: The meal was a pork bonanza tonight.  Salad with buttery lettuce, roasted tomatoes, cucumber, crispy croutons and caramelized slab bacon all in a light ranch dressing.  Lynn Crawford does such a great job at playing with different textures and flavours.  I was in heaven.

Main course:  Juicy and tender pork chop with sausage sauce (!!), spicy escarole with perfectly cooked pork belly, asparagus, barley and mushrooms.  Everything was delicious.  Everything was overly generous.  I wanted to hug everyone.  

Cheese course: Aged local goat's cheese served with grilled, chewy and crusty bread and an eggplant, pepper and pine nut side.  I was losing my battle against the food at this point.  Sooo good.  Sooo full.

Dessert: Homemade cinnamon ice-cream and a rhubarb crumble.  Again - sweet and sour, crunchy and creamy, hot and cold - all playing together.

Sigh.  Does food get better than this??

Vegetarian Score: I have no idea.  I have no doubt that they treat vegetarians well if you tell them ahead of time.  They asked me while I made reservations if my party had any food restrictions.  But since I only had the bacon-fest, I'll have to go back and see."}
{"text":"So, I love this restaurant, have been a few times now, never had a complaint. Food is always top notch. Service has been great. That said, the times I've been here have been the 2nd sitting. We came last Friday for the 1st sitting. Enjoyed a nice meal, sitting with our wine, chatting a bit, when a large group came in and stood behind us, loud, like loud. K, I get that this is the 2nd sitting and we need to leave soon, but then the lights come on!! Wth?! I don't know if this was suppose to be a nice way of saying get the hell out but we've just spent close to 400 bucks for dinner, I'm NOT leaving until my wine is done. This was such a turnoff, so much so that we will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last month with my mom and really, my only complaints were that it's pricey, it's overall too much food (how is this even a compliant?? But I did get a bad stomach ache afterwards - my own damn fault for eating too much), and it is sometimes tricky to find a day to go if you have specific dietary preferences (like my mom, who does not eat pork or red meat, although it does say they accommodate for vegetarians). I totally splurged and got the recommended wine pairings with each course - just an amazing mix of food and drink in a lovely atmosphere. Our waiter was kind, generous (gave me extra wine for free because it was my birthday), and full of personality. Each course in the meal was completely delicious, aside from the cheese (I'm not a fan of mouldy tasting cheese, but on the other hand my mom loved it). 

The best part though, for someone who loves the Food Network, is that Lynn Crawford was there mingling with all the customers. She came over and filled our water glasses and we talked about tattoos for a bit (saw her tattoo sleeve poking out from her chef's jacket). Perhaps we could have had a better conversation had I not been so drunk and star struck. But what a great experience!"}
{"text":"I took my partner to Ruby for her birthday dinner and they did not disappoint. The experience was excellent, the ambiance and aesthetic is beautiful and neighbourhood appropriate, the staff were funny and engaging and knew their stuff. We ended up closing the restaurant, chatting and drinking away with them and it was perfect.

Obviously with a prix fixe set menu, it's a bit of 'luck of the draw' in terms of what you'll be eating but, in our experience, the menu might as well have been created for us. The food was delicious, served family style and my only comment (that is by no means a negative) was that there was little too much food for a 7 course meal."}
{"text":"Aside from the infuriating waits at the start for the waiter and the bill at the end of the night, I enjoyed the dinner service here. When we arrived, we waited for 30 minutes for the waiter to come to our table and didn't even get any water. Thankfully the food saved the day and was delicious, despite the descriptions that didn't necessarily seem too interesting. We got the menu add on, which was some ricotta on toast. I would not recommend, it was the worst part of our meal. Maybe it's better on other days of the week."}
{"text":"We celebrated my girlfriend's birthday here and everything at RWC was exceptional, to say the least.  The food was masterfully cooked and presented, the service was exceptional, and the atmosphere/ambiance made our dining experience memorable.

Our waiter was very informative and helped us with our wine selection for the evening.  It was an upbeat, fun environment and it was very nice to see Chef Crawford get into the action, including serving us directly and clearing our table.  It's nice to see that involvement from the face of the restaurant.

I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone interested in a one of the best dining experiences you can get in Toronto.  Well done RWC, well done Chef Crawford and staff.  You will be seeing us again :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto that is down to earth, non pretentious, great service, great food, and great value for your money. 

First off, the food is locally sourced and is teeming with freshness. The menu is different everyday but consistent week over week (ie Saturday is hangar steak day, Friday is fish day, etc)  each day has a set menu of 4 courses (salad, main with sides, cheese, dessert) for about $55, however you can add additional dishes for an added price. Everything is served family style. 

My fiancÃ© and I went on Saturday and had reservations. Would recommend resos especially on weekends to avoid a long wait as it gets very busy. 

To begin, there was a large salad served that had tons of ingredients in it including root veg, nuts, radish, lettuce, dried fruit and a delicious light dressing. It was fresh, light and a great start to the meal. 

The main was the hangar steak accompanied by some roasted broccoli, sweet potatoes and roasted beets. The hangar steak isn't exactly the fattiest or most tender cut, but they made it very well. It was definitely marinated and sliced thinly when served with a nice bone marrow sauce on top. It was yummy and satisfying. 

The cheese afterwards was nice touch. It was a sizeable amount and definitely approaching fullness afterwards. 

For dessert we got the blondie with vanilla lemon creme freshe. It was the best part of the meal! It was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The creme freshe cut through the sweetness of the blondie and balanced the dish out perfectly. 

Suffice to say, we were completely stuffed at the end of the meal. Last but not least, the service was phenomenal. They were attentive and very friendly. Also very knowledgeable as I did ask about the name and history of \"Ruby watchco\" and they knew all about it. 

Would highly recommend this place for anything really. Whether it be special occasions, friend/family get togethers, or just a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this prix fixe concept, but the food and service were both underwhelming.  Managed to grab a table for two on a Saturday night at 6p without reservation.  The salad with roast beets and goat cheese was fine, the halibut was thick and flaky, but lacking much flavor, the add-on pork belly for $16 was a few inches long, tasty but not worth the additional cost. The best thing was probably the maple pot de creme with a light sweetness and an addictive little crumble.  Maybe we visited on the wrong night and other menus are better, but would not count this in the best meals ever category or the hidden gem (ooh yeah ! puns !) everyone here proclaims it is."}
{"text":"Let me get this out: I HATE THE NAME.

Ok..now onto the rest of the review-
There isn't much I can add that others haven't said already- this is a must try place

PROS:
-REALLY nice space, nice bar, nice tables, nice decor- the ugliest thing about this place would have to be the blaring subway sign from across the street.
-FOOD: Very generous portions on a four course meal.  We had a menu with duck as the main.  the dishes were inventive, original and really well executed.  Farm to table concept a huge plus- seasonal ingredient-list will help inspire your own cooking at home!
-Family style dining in a White restaurant? Great idea : )
-The washroom has those nice thick cloth disposable napkins : )
-The Wine list is accessible with some REALLY great selections- I was surprised to see such a well rounded list and some unexpected choices.
-The space and menu is conducive to both a date and a large group

CONS:
-When I asked them about ability to accommodate Vegetarian diners they basically said that they just wouldn't give us a meat portion.... and they didn't say anything about adding more of other portions... To be straight: there IS NO VEGETARIAN alternative- you'll be off picking at the sides.
-Set menu- which I personally love but MANY of my friends have dietary restrictions- and I have to say... even though they ASK us if there are any dietary restrictions in the group I don't know if they really accommodate... it seems like they just give you a warning and let you know which options are edible..they don't actually give you real alternatives.

A great experience- set menu plus 2 glasses of wine came to about 95$ (incl tip and tax)
It isn't cheap, but it's solid food- I would definitely go back, but only for special occasions..it's a little pricey for me to be going weekly."}
{"text":"Given how difficult it is to get a table in this place, I had very high expectations.  Unfortunately, the food fell a bit short for me.  

Everything that arrived after the just okay salad seemed to rest heavily on browning, charring, roasting or caramelizing.   The coffee mousse was easily the best dessert I ever ate in my life, but when it came on the heals of veal chops that tasted mostly of char grill, toasted spetzle, caramelized onion compote, roasted carrots... it was all just too much of the same caramelizing pallet.  

I love the format of this restaurant - there are too many choices in the world.  But the meal itself has to show a bit more variation and imagination to draw me back."}
{"text":"I think the food was good, but not excellent.  Also, we saw Lynn working the little counter outside the kitchen, but she didn't stop to say hi to anyone other than those who wanted her to autograph their cookbook.  There was a blue cheese at the end, and for many of us, blue isn't really what we would like on its own.  We did ask for a substitute but it seemed like a big deal."}
{"text":"I went to Ruby Watch Co last night for a birthday dinner and was very disappointed with the entire dining experience. To start, the service was very disorganized. We had several wait staff come to the table to take orders that we had already placed. I waited 20 minutes for a cocktail that wasn't very good - I ordered it because it had rhubarb in it and didn't taste it at all, it was completely overpowered by bitters and orange rind taste. The meal came out to we'll over $100 a head, and the food was very mediocre. The fried chicken was soggy, the ribs weren't tender or fall off the bone, and the slaw was unbelievably bland. I honestly couldn't believe the slaw was made by a chef - zero seasoning or acid. On the plus side, the biscuits were delicious and the mac and cheese was very good. But paying over $100 for a really hit and miss meal, poor service, and mains that was far below average is completely unacceptable. I am a massive fan of chef Lynn Crawford, but I was tremendously disappointed with my experience at Ruby Watch Co."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there Saturday March 21st as a date night while the boys were at grandmas. We get there a bit early but they took us anyways. Every single staff member that we dealt with was extremely friendly and always smiling. They lady who greeted us at the door was cheerful but not annoyingly so (you know when you can tell its fake) but she was happy in a laid back natural kind of way. Our server was friendly too and was knowledgeable about the drinks and good. 

I order the Dark and Stormy cocktail and lets just say...if i could only have one cocktail for the rest of my life it would that that one! 

Our food was served timely and the gentleman who served us was friendly too and made sure to tell us about everything that was served. 

We had this beet salad and these warm cheese and herb biscuits. The salad was great but the biscuits were to die for! A dark and stormy and those biscuits and I'm straight for life! 

As others have said, everything is served family style which is great because if 
Then we had the main. It was flank steak and it was juicy, flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"Food was decent but didnt find it worth the hype. Very casual atmosphere and it looked like the staff really enjoyed their jobs."}
{"text":"Great quality food with great affordable price! Friendly staff and its nice to see chef Lynn is very hands on in serving their customer. I will definitely come back and even bring a friend with me."}
{"text":"There are some very strange reviews of this place on Yelp. A: People who complain about the main being meat, when you can pre-order a fish or vegetarian option. B: Others who think it is overpriced, when you are getting a full four-course meal designed by a renowned chef for $58.
The daily menus for the full week are on their website; just reserve based upon what appeals to you. 
 The ambience is very relaxed, although there was a pretty rowdy group of 10-12 across the aisle from us; they were there to have fun, and they did just that.
 The staff were uniformly pleasant and attentive, and there were no sneers or raised eyebrows when we passed on the \"extras\" and the wine pairings. The pacing was a little slow for my liking, but my three companions were perfectly satisfied.
 Food: The salad was very tasty, and exceptionally fresh. I actually missed the dressing at first because it was on the side of the family-style plate and it's pretty dark in there. Nevertheless it was good, with or without the yoghurt based dressing.
 The hanger steak was nicely prepared and appropriately sliced to maximize tenderness. The sides were also excellent. One of our group disliked cheese, so they received a separate order of asparagus, without parmesan...a thoughtful touch. Delicious roasted new potatoes. Like most upscale joints nowadays, they eschew salt and pepper on the table; however, the food was perfectly seasoned, which is certainly not always the case. My wife asked for salt and pepper, but did not use them at all.
 The cheese course was a little disappointing; a lot of Ontario \"artisanal cheeses\" are just bland, and this was one of them. The \"beer jelly\" that came with it was very creative, and exceptionally tasty.
 The dessert was a buckwheat waffle with strawberry and rhubarb compote and burnt CrÃ¨me Anglaise. I don't like sweets at all, but I consumed most of it, which is inordinately unusual.
 I cannot remember having such a well prepared, filling meal for $58 in a long, long time.
 Lynn Crawford came out at about 11pm to chat with the customers. On TV she comes across as a very genuine person compared to most of the \"celebrity chefs\", and she was the same in person. She's clearly someone who is doing what she wants, and enjoying it too...the food reflects that reality, in my opinion.
 Our guests were from the UK and they'd never heard of her, but they were astonished that a well known chef was actually cooking in her own restaurant. As one of them said: \"That's not what happens when you go to 'Jamie's Italian'!\""}
{"text":"Amazing!

I had never been here before so I didn't know how the menu worked.  4 courses and you can add on the extras (which is in brackets for the 2 courses) so of course we ordered everything!  I forgot to take a picture of the menu so I can't remember all the details, but I can say that you will not be disappointed!  It is quite impressive that the menu changes daily!  Each dish felt like there was a lot of thought and care put into it.  The most memorable dishes to me were the beef carpaccio and the BBQ duck.  The drink of the day was a muddled strawberry with lemon and lime with rum.  It did not taste boozy at all but whoa was it strong and delicious!  I enjoyed the family style of eating, it's always fun to try everything on the table!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. If was running a restaurant, it would be something like this. I have always left satisfied and with a smile on my face. The whole experience was enjoyable and it helped that I went with good friends.

I would highly recommend making reservations weeks ahead. There is a slight chance you could get a table walking in but I very much doubt it.

The restaurant's owner is Chef Lynn Crawford. For those who don't know her, for shame! Famous chef and a wonderful person. She's all about fresh seasonal products and she makes deliciousness with them. If you're lucky enough, you may get a glimpse of her cooking in the back and expediting. She is friendly and does walk around the restaurant talking to people when she gets a chance. I've seen her almost every time I've dine there.

The restaurant is a set menu depending on what is in season at the time and is a family style concept. In other words, the food is shared amongst your group. I have been there 3-4 times and never been disappointed. My wife always hopes that they have biscuits, which are so fresh and yummy. Getting their mixed drinks are a must. They are soooo good here. I get more than a few without any arm twisting.

The servers are a wonderful bunch and they treat you like they've known you forever. They always check to see if everything is okay, and not in a invasive way and not because they have to either. It's nice to see people that love what they do.

One of my highest ratings, which I do not give out much. What are you waiting for, let go! I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Five star food, two star service.

Once seated, no one came for ten minutes. Had to ask hostess for service, she took our food order. When he did come, no apology. Did not offer coffee until after we were done dessert. Hovered over us while keying in tip on credit card machine. Seemed disinterested the entire time, some of the worst service ever experienced.

With all that said, the food was amazing. Appetizer salad was perfectly dressed and very fresh. Flank steak was perfectly cooked, and sauce was very tasty. Dessert (waffle) was best course, amazing.

Terrible service, but the kitchen saved the day!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night for a birthday dinner.  We were very late for our reservation but they were very accommodating.  Service was casual yet friendly, witty, and put you at ease.  The food was absolutely delish.  Roasted cauliflower - wow!  Salmon cooked perfectly and pavlova dessert was to die for.  Definitely worth a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! We walked in and sat at the bar. The food was delicious - salad with a whipped trout aioli was really good, hanger steak with sides. The steak was done to perfection and one of the sides was a tomato salad (I'm not usually keen on tomatoes but it tasted really yummy). Cheese with rhubarb jelly and beet jam and last but not least a strawberry/rhubarb crumble to die for. We also did the wine pairing and enjoyed the wines that were chosen. The staff were very friendly and fun. I'm back in Toronto in October and I will go again!"}
{"text":"Ruby watchco serves prix fixe four courses, family style, and menu changes every few days dependent on availability of fresh and seasonal ingredients! Not a good choice for picky eaters but definitely will be enjoyed by a foodie with a wide palate. Very delicious. 

So now everyone knows its prix fixe. Don't complain and give this place a 1 star \"OH BECAUSE I DONT LIKE IT THAT I CANT PICK ANYTHING\" - Dont be lame."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experience I've ever had over the years. Intimate and comfy dining environment, top-notch service and great dishes and wine pairings. 

I walked in knowing that it's a family style tasting menu, and the menu changes every single day. I was amazed by how fast the dishes were brought to our table and how big the portion they are. The wine they paired for us were really unique and great - our server even brought us an extra pair of wines for free for the extra dishes we ordered - that's so nice! 

We booked the table at 9pm because earlier time were all booked out. When we walked in, the restaurant was packed but the service was not slow at all. Things look organized and staff know what they are doing. We finished the meal pretty late (every other table has left) but all servers were happy to accommodate us and not rushing us at all."}
{"text":"Delicious!
Expensive. 
Great company. 
Loved the eclectic prix fixe menu.
I'm overstuffed. Couldn't stop eating. 
I feel like Jabba the Hutt but in a good way. 
Perhaps I'll write more later when I'm not so bloated."}
{"text":"What a delightful treat and experience!  Truly memorable!  A unique experience with friendly staff and the presence of Lynn Crawford made it extra special.

The experience: it is a 50 pix fixe menu, 4 courses, local produce, you don't get to choose what to eat, they pair it for you.  Get it?  Got it? Good.  That is what makes the experience special, you get to experience all local produce of whatever is the freshest for the day.

For starters, they brought out delicious BREAD!  With whipped butter, what could be better than that?   Then we got this yummy CARAMELIZED PEAR SALAD with radicchio and arugula, it was quite a tasty salad, because it was drenched in the perfect amount of sauce and it was not too pungent.

Next course, mains?  We had a plethora of food that was chicken themed.  SMOKED CHICKEN BREAST AND THIGH that was so buttery, didn't taste dry at all.  Was so juicy and succulent.  It came with PURPLE COLESLAW that was a nice crunchy pairing and a SWEET POTATO MASH, that was like eating air.... Sweet buttery air.... *lots of drooling and reminiscing*.  And then at the same moment, they brought put perfectly GLAZED WINGS.... What?  *Insert food coma*.  We vowed to finish our food but it was impossible.  I would have literally exploded.

Nexxttttt, was the CHEESE and CROSTINI.  Which was more than we needed but it tied up the meal nicely and was a great transition before dessert.  It had a nice raspberry and orange jam that we sprinkled on, it was heaven.

Lastly, the APPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE.  Ummm densely packed apple goodness on a sponge-like dense cake... I ate mine and my lovely companions!!!!   The owner offered to bring me another one!!  I kindly declined, but if I had room in my belly..... Then?

What topped it all off was the ambiance and the service.  Joey and Lynn really did make everyone feel so special and even though they were owners, they were in the trenches, working away and making their guests feel like a million dollars.  They treated us to delicious ice wine, probably to shut up us from our rambunctious oooohs and ahhhhh of all the food.  And Joey, what a treat for him to sit down and explain to us the story of how Ruby Watchco was born.  The ambiance is beautiful, I cannot say more good things about this place.  Everyone in Toronto must go, it's quite an experience.  Go, go, go, now!"}
{"text":"The food, the service the ambiance, the whole experience was amazing! The food was delicious, there was not one single thing I put in my mouth that I didn't absolutely love. I loved the family style idea, that it's like a dinner party, and you're all eating the same thing. 

The staff were out of this world amazing! They were joking with each other, while including the tables in on the jokes. Which made everything that much more enjoyable.

it was also nice to see Chef Lynn Crawford in action. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Ruby Watchco for quite some time, and I finally visited last weekend. And it was just what I had imagined. We made a reservation ahead of time, so as we walked in, the table was being set up - just in time! 

The menu is pre-set, which changes daily. There is a base $54 menu, or you can add $18 for a couple of supplemental items. We went all in - without the wine pairings. Each dish was served family style, which really highlights the intimacy of the food and ambiance of this place. 

Fogo Island Cod Cakes (Supplemental) - Small, perfectly cooked. Golden brown on the outside, moist, fresh and flakey on the inside. Great balance.  


Charred Brussel Sprout Salad with Slegers Living Greens, Romaine Hearts, Roasted Apples, Green Goddess, Pistachios, Honey Mustard Dressing - If I could make this, I would have no problem having salad every day for lunch! Just so good!

Pork Fried Rice with a Crispy Ginger Egg (Supplemental) - Good ginger flavor that pairs well with all the other layers. The fried rice was a little hard for my taste, but good. 

Slow Roasted Striploin with Smoked Beef Cheek Marmalade + Sides. - The striploin was cooked to perfection, but putting that aside, the sides were also great. The sweet potato puree/mash was to die for. And the steamed broccoli and carrots were just really well done, although nothing too special. 

Handeck by Gunns Hill Artisan Cheese with Carrot & Celery Salad, Pickled Mustard Seeds - How can you say no to good cheese?! 

Triple Chocolate Brownie with Hot Fudge Sauce, Hazelnuts & Sweet Cream - This was a struggle after such a good meal. I just couldn't say no... just heavenly.

The service was excellent. Everyone was friendly, down to earth and we didn't feel pressured to order anything we didn't want. I honestly have nothing bad to say.
Make reservation ahead of time. Make sure to bring your appetite, and friends!"}
{"text":"Went this past weekend and was so impressed with the excellent service received and ambience of Ruby Watchco. Loved the concept of not having to hassle with deciding what to eat and ordering; each course was unique and delicious; worth the price. Wish they had another location in SoCal but will look forward to my another visit when in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Make reservations in advance, but be sure that you choose a day where the menu excites you. My friends and I unfortunately went on a day where the star of the menu was pork chops. We're not huge meat eaters, so the huge chop was too much for us to handle. Also, we didn't enjoy the goat cheese dish as well. +1 star for the great service and for Chef Lynn being present. She even took a picture with us!"}
{"text":"Reservation:

I had to call 3 times. I finally got a call back the day of, early in the morning. My best guess is they had a cancellation and were able to squeeze me in. I quickly dropped my other reservation for the night and changed my plans. Definitely hard to get a table.

Impression:

Walking in I felt like I was in a warm, welcoming, busy but not hectic environment. The greeter was warm and welcoming. I felt like the place was really alive. Everyone was in good spirits as evidenced by the buzz of many lively conversations taking place. The lighting was medium. I had to raise my voice a little to be heard but I prefer to be in a place that has a buzz. Not good if you want a quiet dinner.

Staff:

Above average in all regards. Friendly, knowledgeable. It is a fixed menu and they were very professional when it came to food allergies and being accommodating. 

Alcohol:

A fixed menu means they can pre-match a wine with their main. And they matched well. A dark, bold, fruity red with the strip loin. Delicious.

Food: 

I was thoroughly impressed with everything, especially the presentation. Someone had taken the time to make sure every detail was perfect. The salad was a bit salty. Otherwise everything was full of subtle flavour. The strip loin was cooked to medium rare perfection. The dessert had delicious creme freche (spelling?). The quality of the ingredients shone. Nothing was overly complicated which my simple palette appreciated.

Price:

I felt like I got more than my money's worth despite the $200 price tag for dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that this was the best restaurant experience we've had this year. We visited on a Thursday at 6:00pm. Big Rock Trad Ale and a Dark and Stormy to start; excellent and excellent. Our server was perfect right from the start; attentive, cordial, socially intelligent, and perfectly engaging.  We opted for the Ham Hock Terrine With Apple & Mustard appetizer addition. The balance of salty, sweet, and spicy, on oil-basked, crusty bread was superb. The main course was a Butter Poached Turkey Breast With Turkey Leg Confit & Gravy (excellent and juicy), Ontario Brussel Sprouts With Willow Grove Bacon (classic pairing done well; lots of bacon), Roasted Butternut Squash With Spicy Aioli (don't remember this one that well) and Smashed Yukon Gold's With Caramelized Onions (i.e., potatoes and onions, but so much tastier then if I had made it myself; I think it was the organic onions). At this point we were both full, but indulged in the Grey Owl By Fromagerie Detour (cheese board) paired with a Heirloom Carrot & Orange Marmalade. Finished the meal with the Pumpkin Cheesecake Coffee Caramel; loved the gram cracker bottom and just pumpkiny enough cheesecake. Throughout the meal our server knew just how to entertain and make us feel like old friends. Overall a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Everything from the food, the service, the atmosphere was amazing. Besides the delicious food, I had made the reservation online and noted it was my anniversary, and even on the way out, the bar tenders declared, \"have a happy anniversary!\"."}
{"text":"Ruby Watchco is an incredible establishment. I feel that my review will feel lacking without a critique but there is no fault to be found.

The menu changes nightly. I had to make my reservation before the menu for the week was posted so I was flying blind. Nevertheless, I did not have any doubts that there would be any disappointment.

On the night we visited, we weren't entirely sure if the menu provided some choices for the sides. All of them came out so we didn't have to choose. Although there was one side that wasn't appealing to us and that we wouldn't have ordered if given a choice, I would still rate it as a great taste and great execution.

The cocktails make use of seasonal ingredients and are well executed. While there is not a lot of depth to the drinks list, it's better to focus and knock it out of the park. They've succeeded here.

The staff is super friendly from the initial reservation call to the time of saying goodbye as you leave. They are fast and inquire about food allergies before starting the meal. The kitchen works quickly and effectively although the chef makes sure to personally visit every table (as an aside, I understand that she is a celebrity in Canada and will gladly pose for pictures if that is your thing). Even if another restaurant never succeeded on a culinary level, mimicking this team would eliminate nearly all customer service issues in the world."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday last year and really enjoy d the restaurant. We thought we'd give it a try once again when my friends from NYC were in town. We booked for 6 people on a Friday night. Unfortunately our party dwindled down from 6 people to two people due to a medical emergency we called the restaurant to change it and apologized as the change happened 2 hours before. Felt really bad about doing but things happen. Fortunately, the person that answered the phone was very accommodating and agreed to change the reservation to two people.

As most people already know, the menu is prix fixe at $54 per person and the menu changes daily. Best to check the website for the menu on the week of your reservation. It's tough to review the food because of the daily change of the menu but we had cod for our mains and I'm not a big fan of fish (except sushi), but even this restaurant can't go wrong with making me like eating fish. Cocktails were served in generous portions. We skipped the wine tasting menu and just opted for a wine pairing for the main.

We were very happy with the service. They were very attentive, the wine arrived as soon as the mains came to our table, water was always filled and the wait staff did not check on us frequently without being overly intrusive. There was even this moment where we were served our cheese course and we thought we were served two different types of cheese and our server was kind enough to check the back if that was the case (consistency differed because it came from two different wheels as it turned out). He didn't have to do that but we greatly appreciated it. 

Overall I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be able to score a reservation while my sister and I were visiting Toronto. We didn't even know what the menu was going to be, but we also didn't really care. Feed me please.

We opted for the second seating with an 8:30pm start. We got our cocktails and then it seemed like we waited a very long time for the service to start...but it's no big deal because we got our socks knocked off. 

First I love that they serve things family style instead of everything coming out plated. One of the highlights of the salad course were the biscuits...h*^% s^#@ are these delicious. The kitchen was generous to send us out 2 more as well as supply me with the recipe. After our grilled zucchini salad there came the main course accompanied by 3 different veggie sides. Needless to say there was more then enough food. Next a cheese was presented and then desert.

For $50 this dinner was a steal. Remember you are eating a meal made from scratch with local produce. The thought and care put into this experience is outstanding. It's such real, honest, simple food.

The only other thing to be aware of is that is gets really loud."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Atmosphere was warm and inviting. Food was awesome. Love the family style presentation. The biscuits were the best biscuits I've ever had. I asked for seconds and I got them no problem.

Service was excellent. Our server forgot to punch in one of our drinks and was so apologetic that when I did bring it he didn't charge us for it. Aside from that, our server was very attentive the entire night. 

Was a bit pricey overall but was a great experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as I expected on all counts. 

Look, I'm sorry, but when Lynn Crawford's name is tied so closely to a restaurant, you expect to be wowed. Period. Of course my expectations were high, but I ask you: Why shouldn't they have been? 

Nice room. Homey yet chic. Refined rustic. 

The service was okay - not great. The most frustrating thing about the service was the lack of attention - when a plate or glass sits empty on my table for more than a couple of minutes, I start to get irritated. I got irritated many times during this meal. Also, I couldn't hear the server - especially the expediter (the dude who brought our courses) - I couldn't hear a word he said. I said, \"pardon\" several times, but he didn't seem to pick up the volume. 

The food was just okay, too. The reinvented greek salad with carmalized black olives was quite good. Fresh indeed. Tasty. Enjoyable. 

The main course was blah. Blah. Definitely blah. Piri-piri spiced striploin tasted more like salt cured meat. Tender to be sure, but salty as hell. The scalloped potatoes were tasteless. The heirloom carrots were raw. Raw. Not tender-crisp. Raw. The mushrooms were the highlight - a little bowl of varietal mushrooms seasoned well with a topping of cheese (couldn't hear what type of cheese it was, but it was quite nice).

The cheese course was boring. An unimpressive miniature mound of aged white cheddar accompanied with two boring-as-melba toast crisps, and two tablespoon's worth of fired onions. I know how to slow cook onions to a carmelized sweetness - that's all this was. They called it an onion jam. Whatever. The were fried onions. 

The hightlight was the dessert. Carrot Cake. Moist and light. Sweet with out triggering a tooth ache.

The point to it all is this - no interest in going back. Been there, done that, skipped buying the T-shirt. Perhaps I caught the kitchen on a bad night, but there are so many other great restaurants in this city, I'm simply not interested in dropping the cash on a gamble."}
{"text":"great meal, had the tasting which started with the beets and garden salad. Maybe a touch too much dressing for my liking but then again i wiped the plate clean. had a trout with some root veggies and brussel sprouts which was very very good and rustic. great ingredients that were cooked simplly, but properly. dessert was a apricot torte...not super memorable and a bit dry for my liking. 

staff was wonderful. the girl at the bar (cant remember her name!) was FANTASTIC and gave me a sweet lesson on Ontario wine. She was very gracious and had a great time conversing with her. She also made a wicked jalapeno, tequila drink which was the 2nd best cocktail i had on my visit. which is saying alot if you know me =) maybe if i loved tequila more id make it my fav. 

anyways, cool spot. big bonus to me is the chef was out and about (aboot?) and really seemed to care about the people dining AND her staff which is big points for me."}
{"text":"I've been here all of two times and I was just blown away by the quality and taste of the food - especially at their prix fixe price point of $50 a head.  First time around it was with Chef Crawford back when they opened Ruby Watchco in 2010.  I can't remember what I had exactly, but the main dish was a delicious flank steak where the portion was so big, I had to put it in a doggy bag afterwards.  Man, that was a delicious lunch the next day.

As for the second and more recent time I've been to Ruby Watchco, which was in August 2014, it was Chef Lora Kirk who took the helm.  I was seated closest to the Chef's table where she was commandeering and seeing to it that every plate was up to her high standards before they went out to each of her diners' tables.  It was fascinating to watch her take command of the restaurant, where she was the central conduit to which the restaurant revolves around.

What I had that day over 4 courses was Sovereign Farm's Bean Salad, Slow Roasted Rack of Pork with Cherry Pork Jus, Bleu Benedictin Cheese with Tomato Jam, Olives & Rosemary Honey, and finally Chef Lora's Sweet Corn pudding which WAS TO DIE FOR! (And I'm not even a dessert kinda guy)

The beauty of the Ruby Watchco model is that its' like being invited to a friend's place, where you have no say in what to order - it's already planned in advance - you just decide if you want to eat that particular evening, and you just show up, and then of course pay afterwards.  It's a very easy choice for those who cannot decide what to eat.  While still novel, I foresee Ruby Watchco being around for the foreseeable future, delighting its patrons and their tastebuds for many years to come."}
{"text":"We have been here at least 4 times now and they have never missed a beat. Went for a group dinner where we accidentally tipped on top of the 18% group gratuity, and when we called to re-check the bill the manager apologized and offered to have us in again for drinks on the house. Admittedly, we still haven't claimed them. The service is attentive and friendly and the food is always fresh (not to mention plentiful) - I describe this place as how you WISH your mother cooked!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with a large group for a birthday party and we were  in the \"Ruby Attic\". Innovative cocktail list. Our special menu was slow roasted beet salad, slow roasted striploin, artisanal cheeses and lemon pound cake. Everything tasted wholesome and delicious. Service was attentive and excellent. We had a dedicated server for the upstairs the whole night. When the main entree came we had a few extra servers to help. I had a nut allergy and they made the salad and other sides to the strip loin without nuts just for me. Decor is antique French farm house style, restaurant downstairs was bustling as well. Washrooms were a bit far for us dining upstairs.  We had a great experience. Great place to try farm to table. Would like to try their regular menu next time."}
{"text":"I liked everthing about this place..
as i walked in i already knew i like the place..
under stated decoration yet well put together in good taste.

and the food reflected just that..
comfy homsy food yet excuted in very perfect way... the way that ur mother cannot do... yet still comforting.

i loved it!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am in love. 

The meal started with this beat salad with a citrus vinagarette, which was good. This however was my least fav course but it was still tasty.

Second or the main was a mustard pork chop with carrots, potatoes, and cabbage, obviously fancier than I said. The food was sooooooo good. I could not stop eating it, minus the cabbage. I wasn't a fan but my mom ate it up. 

The cheese came with a squash which was great. The cheese was so nice. 

Last was the desert. It was a cheese cake with a cranberry caramel sauce. It was soooo amazing. The plate was licked clean of this dish!

I was also upset Chef Lynn was not there. I did tweet her and she advised she is at the restaurant everyday, but thats not the case. 

I will for sure be returning to Ruby Watch Co. hopefully sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time on my birthday in July 2016. 

On my way back from Eriau, ON where we AirBNB'ed we stopped in for a great meal. Chef Lynn Crawford was plating and she was very approachable. She was very interested in who we were and asked for my name. 30 mins after wrapping up my meal she said by Stefan. 

Ok let's get down to foof. The salad we had is probably the best salad I ever had, simple as that. Cocktails were well prepared. Ambience was great, nice buzz, cozy but you can laugh loud if you want. The wait staff is top notch and converse easily with you. I would suggest anyone try it. They are very accomodating to food allergies. As my fellow diner had dairy allergy she said she could \"tough it out\" the waiter said \"We don't do it like that here. We do it right.\"  She had no pains whatosever and adjusted the whole five course meal to what she could have. 

Well done Ruby. P.S. The name of the restaurant is based on a sign they found and just put it on the wall. lol"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Ruby Watchco and I was pretty excited about heading into this Lynn Crawford establishment with an interesting family-style dining concept.  The restaurant only offers a set prix fixe menu and each day the offerings are different and unique.

The staff were super friendly at the front of house with little antlers on their heads and feeling the holiday spirit. Lynn Crawford was making sure things were running smoothly at the pass.

The decor inside is contemporary and it emits an intimate but familial atmosphere with the not-too-dim lighting and tables with a cushiony booth against the wall. 

Our menu for the night was:

a. a starter of Ruby Watchco caesar salad that was really fresh.  It had this really tangy caesar dressing along with the crispy bacon, crunchy croutons, 

b. the entree was a really long braised (24hr) pork belly with two whole deep-fried soft-boiled eggs sitting in a thick and creamy crab meat hollandaise sauce. The meal was surrounded with 3 sides: oven-roasted squash, mashed sweet potatoes, and some other roasted veggies.

It was a meal that was fit for a winter night provided by the combined weight of the pork belly, soft-boiled egg, and the creamy hollandaise sauce.  The soft-boiled egged was lightly deep-fried and coated in a crunchy tempura like coating while the hollandaise sauce was filled with crab meat.  Absolutely liberal and generous use of the crab meat.  Yum.

Only hiccup with the meal was that the pork belly was braised with the thick skin on top. When we tried to cut it with the knife, the skin doesn't cut easily but the weight of the cutting kinda smushed the rest of the pork belly and it just kinda went splat into the plate.

c. the entree was followed by a nice cheese plate and was full of savoury goodness.  It was complemented by some jams and other things.

d. the dessert was a really delicious and rich slice of bread pudding.  We each got our own plate and it was a great cap off to a fantastic meal for the night.

I would come back here again but would definitely visit their website to see if the menu du jour peeks for interest and appetite."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and twice my expectations were blown out of the water. 
The first time I came, Chef Lynn Crawford was cooking. The second, she was not. Both times the food was consistent in flavor, presentation and just overall wow. 
4-5 course meal that is very affordable. Wine pairing is also an option. 
Antony is fantastic, as always. Very good with timing, knows how to read a table well and when to come in. Offered excellent service both times we had him. 
The restaurant is a set menu and is very accommodating to allergies, food restrictions and even preferences. 
If you're here for a visit, this is a must. If you live in Toronto, still a must!! Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has impeccable service. I ordered a drink which was delicious but it was not a drink that I would normally order. The staff offered to replace my drink and made a delicious drink that was down my alley and it was Fabulous. The night we went there they were serving veal it was so so delicious. I will definitely recommend my friends visiting Toronto to come here."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Inside, the decor complements the space well and feels understated just like the neighborhood. RWCo isn't about flash, it's about full quality meal from beginning to end. The menu changes weekly I believe and each course has a local wine recommendations, the pairings are wonderful. Additionally, portion sizes are quite generous; you'll likely leave satisfied with a nice lunch for the following day :)

I love Leslieville."}
{"text":"It's a set menu so you really only have to decide what to drink.  The wine list is the only thing I wish was bigger.  

We were seated next to the kitchen - was fun watching all the activity.  

We had flank steak which was excellent - the sides were really yummy too.  Overall it was an excellent meal - and the ambiance was great.  

I'm a big fan and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service friendly and relatable, and comfortable ambiance. 

Each night is a featured meal, served family style.  Craft cocktail, I got the Garden of Eden, with Grey Goose was refreshing.  The Cab Franc wine from Uruguay (yes, Uruguay) was delicious as a pairing.  The evening we went was Canadian traditional meals - fancy style!  

Only lost a point, based on limited alcohol and beer selections."}
{"text":"Loved it, loved it, loved it! Definitely expensive, but such a special experience. Everything is freshly cooked and beautifully plated. We were lucky enough to sit near the kitchen and watched the chef to work the magic. Even though the menu is set, they accommodate the gluten free and some other dietary restrictions our group had. Definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Dare I say the best Resto in our great city...?! Definitely one of the greats -  A foodie must try."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner for 3 and it was surprising easily to make a reservation and they always seem to have seats. It was a Saturday night and there were still tables left. The interior was pleasant and didn't feel trendy like most restaurants these days and felt like I walked into a chain restaurant. There is a server there though that had CREEPY vibes (I don't want to be mean saying that!) But he would ask us questions in a soft whispy voice with a deadpan face and just starred the whole night. It was odd and AWKWARD but I guess kinda funny? 

We started with scones and a salad. The scones were great and fluffy with a crispy outside. The salad was fresh and I loved the Brussel sprouts, it had a lot of shredded cheese on top and not too much dressing which I love.

The main was seared fish with grapefruit salsa. The fish looked small but ended up being very filling! It was a thick slice and cooked nicely, was a little rough but still delicious. The grapefruit added a nice sweet and tangy freshness and was a little spicy with some jalapeÃ±o peppers. 

It came with 3 sides. Charred broccoli with a creme on top. The broccoli were massive, it was like eating little trees. The potatoes were really good and roasted until they were really crispy. And a beet slaw which was on the sour side and felt ver fresh. 

The cheese plate was good although small for 3 people. With 1 slice of cheese each, it came with a creamy sweet mustard, candied orange and olives. It was ok, not amazing. 

For dessert I got the chestnut cheesecake pot, personally not a huge fan of chesnuts but this was great and it came with a cherry compote on top. The presentation wasn't the prettiest because it looked like a light brown mush, but it wasn't too sweet and very smooth. 

For $65 I did leave very full and everything did feel fresh and a great place in the neighborhood. I was satisfied but something felt like it was missing and left me wanting more in a bad way. But we never felt rushed with the meal, which was nice. If someone asked to me to I would return, but not a place I would pick immediately especially for the price."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience with such high hopes and expectations.  Had a mediocre meal, mediocre service,  and followed up with an email and a Facebook message and received absolutely no feedback or even an acknowledgment.   Will not go back here ever, and will not pass on any positive remarks either.  Ms. Crawford has always been someone I respected and have followed for years.  She's lost a fan."}

{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner 
Menu items (Apr.8.11): Eco Farms Country Ham & Sleger's Green Salad, Pan Seared Trout with Newburg Seafood Salad, ChÃ¨vre Noir & Cold \"Hot\" Chocolate
Wine Pairing: Pinot Gris Herrenweg 2004, Barmes-Buecher

Ruby Watcho is unlike any other restaurant in this city. Reason number one being that the meals are freshly cooked by renowned Food Network Canada Star, Chef Lynn Crawford. Reason number two? Her culinary background and passion for creating meals with fresh ingredients, that at times make it to one's table straight from the farm, defies the laws and traditions of upscale restaurants serving the same old menu week after week.

At Ruby, you will find a set 4 course prix-fixe menu for CDN$49.00, which changes every night they are open for business. The ingredients usually come from local farms, some of which I am sure were visited at some point or another during Chef Crawford's Pitchin' In shootings. 

Some reviewers have deducted points from Ruby because there is only one menu with no other choices. I would say to those people to look beyond their noses and appreciate not only the Chef's creativity but also the quality of meals they are eating. Fresh daily menus not only guarantee these ingredients have been hand-picked and well thought of, but also that the food one is eating is organic, fresh, healthy and home-made. You rarely find this at restaurants these days. 
I wonder, how does one know that the meat, salad or veggie one gets at a restaurant featuring the same menu every night has not been seating for weeks at their pantries and fridges? 

My night at Ruby Watchco started with me realizing that Chef Crawford was actually cooking my meal. First impression - \"OMG Lynn Crawford is actually cooking?\". Most Chefs these days open restaurants, create their menus and off they go to do their thing. This is certainly not the case at Ruby.

Featuring a home-made style of items, our meal started with the Hope Eco Country Ham & Sleger's Green Salad.
Romaine hearts, smoked blue haze (blue cheese), Thompson Yukon gold hickory sticks, country ham and bosc pears with darling honey vinaigrette, made this starter salad a close contender to my old time favourite 17 ingredient slaw from Chef Susur Lee. 
We also decided to pair our entire meal with the featured wine of the night, a sweet and intense Pinot Gris from the Alsace region of France. No further introduction needed, I'd say. 

The second course was a Pan seared Trout with Newburg Seafood Salad. The trout was tender and fresh; but besides the freshness of the fish, combined with the freshness of shrimp and mussels found at the bottom of the casserole (this is Chef Crawford's homey plating style, love it), we found ourselves floating in a delicious Bouillabaisse style broth. Another finding was realizing Ruby will ensure you leave with a full tummy. The main course also came with roasted Fingerling Potatoes, sauteed greens with Chorizo Coins and Braised Fennel with Spinach Hazelnut Pesto. This in itself would have been enough; ok I take that back, knowing me I could have eaten two of these.

As a meal digestif (or at least I like to call it that), we had the ChÃ¨vre Noir. Placed on top of a tasty toast (how many T's is that?), the ChÃ¨vre Noir was my PiÃ¨ce de RÃ©sistance. Once again I take that back, maybe Chef Crawford cooking for us that night was the actual piÃ¨ce; but either way, we had too many resistances here. Personally, I think \"resistance\" should translate to (although it doesn't) IRRESISTIBLE.

Last but not least, our dessert course...Ruby's Cold \"Hot\" Chocolate.
Dessert consisted of a house made marshmallow foam with praline crumble. I believe this is Crawford's version of a lovely Hot Chocolate, but cold (sarcasm alert). Jokes aside, this was a lovely way to end our meal. I do have to admit I was not entirely a fan of its temperature. I guess the dessert was made that morning and placed in the fridge in time for the night; however my dessert was way too cold for my personal taste, and the ceramic cup was also freezing. I would've appreciated Ruby leaving it out a bit before.

For some of you that are wondering if Chef Crawford made it to our table, well let me tell you she did! Not only every time I glanced up I saw her cooking in the semi-open concept kitchen, but she also stopped by. I am ashamed to say that I was so star-struck that the only words that came out of my mouth were \"Big fan, I love you\". Seriously?
Out of all the things I could have said to one of my favourite Chefs, this is what comes out? I wanted to tell her about my blog, my passion for cooking and trying new and exciting restaurants, but instead I left her with an uncomfortable situation. Her reply - \"Oh, you are fun\". Oh well, next time I will control myself.

Until next time Foodies!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Great night out for a special occasion. Great food,  excellent service. It's fun having several courses served to you without having to make the selections yourself.  Staff is also very attentive to food allergies.  The place is very loud though,  and pretty cramped.  Those are my only criticisms."}
{"text":"Loved our meal - Lynn is truly on fire!  Great cocktails, awesome wine list - the sommelier helped us stretch to new flavours..found a new white that I loved.  The night we were there the salad starter was sooo delicious that we almost wanted to order a second round.  The cheese biscuits were deadly good...again we could have just had bread and salad and we would have left happy - our main was Arctic Char...which I would never normally order - was done to perfection.  Very creative with flavours but not in a contrived way...fresh and accessible, yet highly sophisticated...Can you tell I liked it?!  

I would highly recommend for any foodie.  Not a great choice for a picky eater or 'I want that on the side' type...

Great energy and chill crowd.  Great servers and bar staff.  Perfect for a date or small group...

Go!"}
{"text":"First off, we called to make reservations for Friday night and no one answered so we thought we were out of luck.  But, Friday morning the restaurant called us back and set up our reservation.  They did warm of this on the web site, so was happy they followed through!
We showed up to the reservation ten minutes early and were seated immediately.  Yeah!  It is a set menu with wine pairing option.  We did the set menu with wine pairing and my husband got the supplement, which was a duck leg that day.  (Of course he did!!!). So, seeing as it was a set menu I was confused when the server asked what we were interested in?!?  Is there a question?!  I was confused by this.  
Anyway, salad was first.  It is served family style, Which I wasn't thrilled with. Just my preference, but I would rather see a plate with presentation.  The salad was delicious with grilled romaine and cranberries!  Yum!  The wine they gave us as a pairing was ice cold!  Not the way to serve wine!  But once it was a bit more room temp, and you could taste it, the flavors went well.  
Main course was again family style.  (Meh). There were three veggies and a fish.  All were delicious, different flavors put into each and the fish was perfectly cooked!  The wine (also way too cold, but eventually warmed up) went with it well!  Very impressed with the flavors and freshness!  
Cheese course, which I was so excited for was meh!  I just think the cheese this night was not my personal fav.  The flavor combo was great, just not my favorite style. 
Dessert was delicious.  It wasn't a sweet dessert, but the dessert wine that accompanied it was matched well!  Yum!  
Overall the food was great!  Just a few little things, like our weird server, and the family style, that weren't my fav, but would definitely recommend trying this place!  It is a bit more expensive, but worth it for flavor and freshness!!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.
  We ate on a Friday night in an extremely noisy restaurant. Service was good, but the meal was hugely expensive, almost $500 for five people with not very much alcohol included. The best part of the set dinner was the wonderful salad and a fine carrot cake. The trout was only OK, the vegs not outstanding. The rolls were excellent. In all, somewhat disappointing."}
{"text":"What's there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? It's amazing. The decor, the food, the service, having Chef Lynn there at the pass all night working her butt off.... just a great experience. One of the best in Toronto.

The Grilled Cheese Sandwich Salad wasn't as interesting as it sounded, but what it was was one of the best salads I've ever tasted. The grilled veal was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the nicest veal chop I've ever had. The queso fresco grilled corn, the roasted broccoli with lemon butter.... everything was just superb.

2 gripes: the carmelized onion/dill potato salad wasn't very good, and the seats I find really uncomfortable. My wife said the bench she was on was great but my ass was hurting from sitting in the wooden chairs after like 10 mins. 

Besides that though the whole experience was just top notch."}
{"text":"Visited with my wife and mother and we all loved our meal. Mom was so excited to meet Chef Lynn Crawford (who autographed a cookbook for her). Highly recommend. Just remember, there is only one meal served each night, so everyone is having the same."}
{"text":"4/5

I went here last November and it's my favorite restaurant experience of last yr. I been meaning to check this place out but i couldn't, due to my very last min planning and they were usually fully booked by the time when I attempted to make a reservation. Now they offer more convenient reservation system than before, I decided to finally check this place out. And boy .. I'm happy that I made a trip to visit Ruby Watchco.

Ruby Watchco serve family style set menu. Everything in the restaurant is from local and they change their menu all the freaking time. So I won't list all the food that I had but every dish was very fresh and taste was pretty on point (and I'm very hard to please when it comes to food lol). I'm not much of a salad girl but their salad was one of the best salad I had in awhile. I was so sad to finish the salad.  

Service was quite good. It's not jacobs nice but I was very pleased that they were not like other hip restaurants on west side aka rude snobby servers. 

Ambience is cuter then I expected. It has little classy hip industrial look mixed with cozy farm house. it has that Gusto vibe but more cozy and comfy setting with nicer service. It's a perfect place for cute date night to family gathering.  

Roby watchco pleasantly surprised me in many way. I don't usually give 4 stars but this place deserve 4 stars. I'll definitely come back here again whenever I end up in east side of the town."}
{"text":"Ruby Watchco is definitely worth all the hype. It's my favourite \"special occasion\" restaurant. The food isn't cheap, but it's amazing value for what you get and well priced for a nice dinner out. The service is stellar and the decor is so, so nice and simple. I would eat there every night if I could. I've eaten there a handful of times, and each time the food is so good that I nearly cry. 

You know the concept already: each night has a fixed menu of local food. What's really great is that the kitchen is completely accommodating to any dietary restrictions - gluten-free, vegan, pescatarian - and they will whip up something that makes your tablemates jealous.

Bonus is that Chef Lynn also helps serve tables when it gets busy - she could not be nicer!!"}
{"text":"Who'd knew a television celebrity chef would have a restaurant in the part of town so close to home and where I grew up? Somewhere in between wondering what the hell the name \"Ruby Watchco\" meant, one day I actually went in and ate here.

Lynn Crawford's ethos of wholesome fresh local food is reinforced in its daily menu, which always changes according to seasonal availability, so you may something completely different the next day. What y'all be enjoying for dinner will be posted online and at the door; y'all be eating the same high quality planned-to-the-molecule meal as everyone else tonight; and y'all be paying the same $49/person prix fixe bill. 

It's quite a restaurant concept, this supper club style we-will-decide-what-everybody-will-eat-tonight and everyone-eats-the-same-food-communally as if like showing up at a relative's dinner scheme (it's not that different from the all-familiar Asian-style dining). The main influence you have with your meal is whether you have a dietary restriction (like allergies or lactose intolerance), which they accommodate by throwing the concept out the window and serve instead individually prepared dishes for each party member, making substitutions as necessary to make the adapted meal resemble the intended gastronomic experience for everyone. Trust me, this is what I had to put up with in my party.

What I really had to put up with is the constant plate changing, which gets annoying when you're served individual dishes (see previous paragraph) because that throws the staff off the moment they take your blank plate away. If you're seated next to the centrally located cupboard where staff are constantly there grabbing plates or replenishing them with freshly cleaned ones, that can be a bit disruptive to your dining. But you do also have to put up with the cheerful, overly friendly personalities of each individual server you encounter.

As for the food, each course (we were served a four-course setting on our visit) seemed scientifically planned out for maximum flavour and flavour compatibility, never mind meticulously plated presentation. Each dish and bite was a medley of carefully considered and totally elevated complementary tastes--it's juicy, it's crunchy, it's sweet and tangy, it's a foodie parade in your mouth. More surprising still, was the pork chop that was part of our dinner. I was expecting for a place like this a pathetic small portion. Instead came a big manly ass piece of meat, like something I'd serve my dog and it'll take her a week to finish. It was large and it was bloody hell tender and moist and savoury, perhaps one of the most well-prepared pork I ever had, and a delicious menace to finish.

Reservations is highly recommended, as I always see the tables packed at peak evening dinner hours. There is a bar as well, which I guess could accommodate unlucky walk-ins, but I never in my dining session saw anyone there. Well, maybe a couple sitting there while waiting for others in their party, but other than that the bar is usually empty for an otherwise loud and popular east-end restaurant.

{TTC: the 501-2-3-4 trams to Queen/Broadview. There's also a big ass Green P municipal parking lot behind the restaurant on Broadview.}"}
{"text":"Ruby Watchco really is all that and a bag of chips. The food here is as honest as it gets. While you know in your heart there is a thread of pretentiousness that is the aura of this food harbour you simply give it up the minute you wrap your lips around one of their buttery, hot, freshly baked herb & cheese biscuits. All of a sudden you don't notice the noise, you don't notice the seen and wannabe seen's sitting all around you and any thoughts you have about Restaurant Makeover makes a swan song exit out of your brain. Those are some MoFo kinda biscuits. Ask for refills, they gladly oblige. 

I've been to RW twice and in both cases I had pork. You know the schtick on this joint, one menu, daily change, etc. etc. etc. So at least by having pork both times I feel like I have a baseline for comparison. Our first visit we sat in the very front of the resto, on the second visit we sat right at the back, in front of the prep/platter area. Chef Lynn Crawford was running the kitchen during my inaugural visit and Chef Lora Kirk the next. 

So here's how it panned out: 

First Courses: 
1st Visit - Mixed greens with smoked trout, heirloom tomatoes, marinated green beans, roasted beets, spicy sliced gherkins and a big fat dollop of egg salad on top. 
2nd Visit - Thinly sliced zucchini salad with heirloom tomatoes, roasted beets, roasted peppers and a toasted almonds in a light citrus vinaigrette. 

Winner: From an aesthetic standpoint the zucchini salad was gorgeous but I have to say the first salad had so many textures going on that I liked it better. 

Main Course: 
1st Visit - Pork Loin in a brown rosemary sauce. Sides included a Chorizo Risotto; A zucchini dish with cabbage, sugar snap peas, beans etc; Seared rapini & mushrooms 

2nd Visit - Grilled Pork chops with a peach chutney. Sides included another dish with sausages; A savoy cabbage slaw and a Polenta Potato concoction that had mushrooms and large pearl onions in it. 

Winner: Of the two pork dishes, hands down the winner was the grilled pork chop with the peach chutney. The polenta potato dish was fabulousness. I'd have passed on the slaw and would have loved the rapini dish again. 

Cheese Course: 
1st Visit - Fifth Town Cheese. It was soft and creamy like a Riopelle/Tallegio. It was served with a Grapefruit compote. 

2nd Visit - Montforte Dairy Cheese which was very dry and hard, akin to a Parmesan. It was served with drunken raisins and shredded carrots. 

Winner: I love Ruth Kahlsen the Montforte Dairy cheese goddess to bits but I have to go with the Fifth Town with the unbelievable delicious grapefruit compote. It just was so decadent yet the acid of the grapefruit just gave it the balance it needed. 

Dessert: 
1st Visit - Cherry S'mores which was actually more like dessert food porn. It was macerated cherries atop a base of graham crumbs, with a large thick wad of melting chocolate, topped with homemade marshmallow that had been toasted. 

2nd Visit - Again with the cherries and the chocolate. Macerated cherries atop a brownie with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. 

Winner - Gotta go with the Larry Flynt of desserts, the porn S'mores. So here's my food fantasy around these S'mores.... it involved Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights and I get to recreate my own scene. K, 'nuff said 'bout that. I think you get the idea. 

The wine & cocktail lists are absolutely decent. I was really pleased to see some non Ontario wine options on the wine list even though I opted for an unoaked Chardonnay from Organized Crimes. 

Service was good. This place is hopping so these guys really earn their coin. Our waitress was good hearted and when I showed up first with flowers for Shari & her Mother, the waitress immediately said, let me take those from you, put them in the fridge and just let me know when you'd like me to bring them."}
{"text":"Great ambience, hearty and warm meal and great fun overall!"}
{"text":"i was working one summer with this theatre director/designer in Watermill, New York on one of his many projects, some of which were destined to materialize no less than five years in the future.  His name was Robert Wilson, and in addition to being heralded as a one of a kind international theatre creator, he is also known to be very exacting.  

His Watermill centre is a place where many people of many disciplines gather to work on his projects, and one of those folks, is a chef (and his/her crew).  One day Bob and I were sitting down waiting for the food to be served buffet style and as the dishes were being placed on the table, he leaned over to me and said, almost in mourning, \"he doesn't even think about what kind of bowls he uses.\"  He was talking, in case it wasn't clear, about the chef's choice of serving bowls and his lack of thought in pairing food with it's presentation.

Ruby Watch Co. would not have suffered the same disdain from Mr. Wilson and this is evidenced in many ways.  As we walked into the restaurant, we were jovially greeted by two hostesses and while they scanned the reservation book we noticed a monolithic size filing cabinet of some sort.  It appeared to have been plucked straight out of Apocalypse Now from some scene where soldiers take a break from fighting to go pick up their mail.  (That scene still probably sits all chapped and yellowed on the cutting room floor...).

We were seated very quickly, where our main server, reconfirmed that indeed we needed one vegetarian/pregnant meal and one regular prix fix.   The pregnant meal, you might be wondering, has only to do with the cheese course they serve as part of their set menu.  (Pregnant women can only eat pasteurized cheeses.).   These conditions of patronage were handled as smoothly as the homemade churned butter that accompanied the tasty biscuits adorning our first course of caesar salad.

Though simple in invention, the salad was fresh, creamy and tasty with a nice chicken patty nestled within, almost akin to the consistency of a crab cake.  As we waited for our successive courses, in between our gabbing, i noticed the huge self titled sign that ran the length of the long wall preceding the kitchen.  This flashy, yet worn sign, all made of mirrored mosaic, could have been ripped off the roof of a factory now probably home to many a condo dweller.  The mystery still lives on....

My wife delved into her creamy asparagus risotto; the vegetables cracked with a nice crispy freshness.  I had a pork tenderloin that was done in an Asian flair called ABODO STYLE.  Visually this meant a few slices of meat in a ruby coloured sauce that came with a little le creuset dutch oven - perhaps stolen from an upscale easy bake oven set of some little five year old - that held in it a fluffy, fragrant puff of jasmine rice.  To be fair, i dont know that id pick pork tenderloin on a menu;  i dont know whether its a kind of meat i like.  it cannot be cooked medium rare, it must be cooked well done, which is not exactly what i prefer.  that being said, it was not dry, and was complemented by the tang of the sauce in which it bathed.  I also enjoyed a little bit of crunch around each slice's circumference.  With that, there were fresh carrots and green beans in a caramelized onion butter.  i wouldnt have known that, if not for having just read it on their website, but i can tell you that the veggies were bright and clear, if that makes any sense.

Before slathering cheese and rhubarb chutney onto toasted country bread, i could spot the servers, dressed in black ironed tops, with black jeans, with, um, black converse sneakers?  (Just one guy, but I appreciated it.).  I had a stilton and my wife had a cows milk cheese, visually akin to the omnipresent brie, which was severed down the middle with vegetable ash...(you and me will both look that up later...).  

Finally we had this strawberry ice cream with a lemon cake drowned inside it, further obscured by a couple of preserved strawberries (i think preserved..) and whipped cream.  Pretty good, but not what I'd choose for desert, but perfectly sized and balanced in taste.

Did I mention the drinks?  My first expedition led me into a Queen East Bourbon Ice Tea or some such name, which had mint, lemon, some kind of special ice tea and of course, bourbon.  So refreshing and so not cloyingly sweet.  That was followed by a Hungarian red wine, that, both the server and I, after a minute or so of trying to give it it's descriptive due, came up with nothing more poignant then, \"it's really different.\"  When i become a sommelier i'll get back to you.

Overall, i love that i can preview the menu on a day to day basis, their spirit and casual atmosphere and of course their delightful food."}
{"text":"What a wonderful and filling homestyle meal I had last night at Ruby Watchco!  

This restaurant - which attracted me initially because of star chef Lynn Crawford, who is famously hardworking and down-to-earth in addition to being creative and brilliant (yes, I am a huge fan!) -  is quite cozy, and I felt welcome immediately. As others have stated, service here is friendly and attentive but not overbearing.  I had a feeling I was in for a great night!

The menu started us off with a fantastically fresh heirloom carrot and beet salad with endives, crispy goat cheese, and brown derby dressing - and please brace yourselves now:  Chef Lynn served this to us herself !!!  What an honour to meet her so early in the game!  My friend and I were thrilled. It is obvious Chef Lynn takes great pride in the local ingredients chosen and how they are prepared. We were in a top pro's hands.

We were so anticipating the slow roasted pork loin with sausage gravy  (I know, sounds like bliss!) - and it did not disappoint.  Juicy, tender, full of flavour with the most amazingly deeeeeelicious pan drippings ever, accompanied by tasty chesnut-and-herb spaetzle (look it up...it's like stuffing!), a variety of fabulous mushrooms and greens, and sauerkraut.  The portions were perfect for the two of us. Comfortably I can say it was a bit like family Thanksgiving dinner, with us passing a hodge podge of side dishes along to each other. :)

Later Chef Lynn helped clear our table (yes, wow!  It was busy, and she was truly helping her staff!)  and let us know we were in for a surprise soon with a Canadian artisanal cheese and country bread. Though the name of the cheese escapes me at the moment - one of our fine servers told us as he set the offering down - what I CAN tell you is it was a rich few bites of heaven!  It came with spicy butternut squash butter - quite nice!    

Dessert was a simple but tasty Vanilla and Star Anise poached flemish pear with citrus marscapone and candied pine nuts...YUM!

I feel terrible, because my friend and I stayed waaaay past our due - from 6:30 to 10:30pm! - but we were enjoying each course, being quite leisurely, and not feeling any pressure to leave!  As we were heading out, we thanked Chef Lynn (I didn't see Chef Lora at that point at the front) and she let us know about a charity event for Mount Sinai she'd be in along with Bobby Flay!  Great cause.

Off we went home, happy and full!  Lovely, low-key, relaxed place to take a friend, your partner, a group, anyone who loves great food and is open to the fixed menu idea...enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Ruby Watchco for dinner. Canadian Chef Lynn Crawford opened this place! Service was excellent. The atmosphere is warm and cozy.

It seems like they change up their menus often. 

DRINKS:
* Pinot red wine (his)
* Chardonnay white wine (mine)

Our menu for the night includes:

SMOKED COD & BACON SALAD (5/5)
This was so delish!! Loved the cod x salad combination. We really enjoyed this as our appetizer. Opened up our tummies for our mains :)

HANGER STEAK with RUBY'S STEAK SAUCE (3/5)
The steak was the main dish and we were both looking forward to it the most. Unfortunately, it was rather dry :( The sides that came with the steak were amazing though!!

The side dishes that came with the steak (5/5)
* Mashed carrot & sweet potato
* Red onion relish & feta creamy parsnips with vanilla salted almonds
* Foraged mushrooms & spinach

All of the above were SO good, we were surprised that it was even better than the main!

ARTISANAL CHEESE w date & orange marmalade (4/5)
I really liked the cheese, the marmalade made a great pairing.

JUNE'S CARROT CAKE with coffee frosting and caramel (5/5)
Loved this! The coffee frosting was bitter on its own but eating the carrot cake combined with the caramel sauce made this dessert so delicious :D"}
{"text":"Large portions, fixed menu that changes every night. Wished we didn't have the steak that night but it was still good. Just thought that there's not much you can do to showcase your culinary skills with steak compared to other dishes. Family style dining. The best part was the liver pate - it's a must get!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to the much anticipated Ruby Watchco today for my birthday. Several good points and some areas of improvement. 

Our menu for the evening:

To start: Charred Cauliflower Salad with onion chive biscuit - salad had a good texture with a mix of greens and couscous, but nothing too special B+. The biscuit was delicious - A+! One of my faves! 

Main: Black Peppered Brick Chicken with Spicy Mustard & Arugula  - this was too salty and dry - not a fan C-
Eggplant, oven kissed tomatoes and basil pesto - great dish. eggplant was not too hard or soft. great flavor! A+
Confit garlic yukon gold smashed potatoes - my FAVE - a simple dish, but melted in my mouth - A+
Hillside Garden's heirloom carrots with onion petals - this was good - nothing too much to say about this B+

We also added the supplement - Crispy egg, keilbasa, polenta and parmesan cheese- this was a very visually appealing dish - the egg was boiled and deep fried after with panko - it was not bad. the keilbasa and polenta had great flavouring! this was a one of a kind unique dish! A+

Artisanal cheese - not a fan... my bf and i aren't into very strong cheeses and this was pretty intense. It may be great for someone that is a cheese connoisseur. for a non connoisseur, I  have to say the pairing was not bad - puree beets with pickled radish and wine pairing - cool taste combo, but not my thang. C

Ruby Red Grapefruit Tart - one of my faves on the entire menu - amazing pairing of taste and texture! i got the wine pairings  and the riesling was a good touch to this awesome dessert. A+

Good Points:

1. The decor is very cool. Has a touch of antique chic to it. We sat right near the door. Facing us was a beautiful antique library shelving unit with card and book holders. Very rustic and cute. The chairs or couches and lighting gives Ruby a very chic look to it. Definitely a plus for the decor of the place.

2. The food was plentiful! We did not go home hungry and even had several left over containers. 

3. They change their menu every day and can accommodate any dietary restrictions such as veggie, vegans, dairy-free and gluten-free, which is pretty cool. So if it's a miss this time, you can always give the place a second try - however, it is a pricey place.

Areas of improvement:

1. My boyfriend booked this place a month in advance. They called him to confirm the reservation today and he told them that it was my bday. They said they would take care of it and put a candle on my tart. This did not happen!!! I overheard them ask another table if they were celebrating an occasion and offered to put a candle on their tart. I was disappointed that our server did not ask nor the person that called us did not rely the message to our server.

2. They charged us $3 for still water and did not give an option for tap water. we thought still and tap were the same. oops on our part. would be good for them to say all three options including sparkling, still and tap.

3. Our main server wasnt the most friendliest. She gave a vibe that she didn't really want to be there. When I asked her questions, she was pleasant and gave good information. She was efficient, but we didn't really feel welcomed. Some of the other servers that brought us the food was hilarious and helped us take pics!  I guess a hit and miss for this one. 

Overall, this restaurant was not bad. I think I had higher expectations of it and probably compared it to other top 4.5-5 stars like shoto. If i could, i would give this a 3.5 out of 5. I am glad I tried it, but I will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A pricey but delicious meal.  Definitely recommend getting the wine pairings, they had some really unique selections.  All of the food was delicious.  I was really impressed with the menu.  My favorite thing may have weirdly been the starting salad.  It had such incredible flavor to it, and I wish every salad tasted like that (I'd be so healthy).  

All in all, a great spot!  Definitely recommend, and make a reservation! :)"}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm posting this review a bit late...it's been sitting in my drafts pile for a while.

I've been to Ruby Watchco a few times now and while I love Lynn Crawford and the concept of this restaurant, something has changed between my first couple of visits and my last one. I thought maybe it was just an off night, but judging from more recent reviews it might be a trend.

The menu that night featured:
Smoked Trout BLT Salad (greens, bacon lardons, corn bread croutons, cherry tomato dressing)
Slow Roasted Rack of Pork with Plum Sauce (with Crispy Smashed Potatoes with Sour Cream & Scallions,Ontario Kale, Sweet & Smokey Mustard Dressing,
Grilled Carrots with Charred Almond Aioli)
Supplement of Ruby's ribs and wings with honey mustard sauce (+$18)
Artisanal cheese with roasted tomatoes, olives and confit onion
Zucchini Pecan Cake with Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting

We started off with a cocktail that was ridiculously sour. I like sour, but this was undrinkable. The server told me it was supposed to be that way, so I asked her to try it and tell me if that was really true. Needless to say they brought me something else to drink...

The smoked trout salad was wonderful, as were all of the sides. 

The pork however was incredibly tough and served with just a regular dinner (non-serrated) knife. It was so tough that when the server asked how everything was I let her know. She reported back to the kitchen and Chef Lynn emerged. She seemed apologetic until she said \"I don't want to insult you by saying that's the way it's supposed to be if you don't enjoy it\". Um, if that's how it's supposed to be, then give me the freakin' appropriate knife with which to eat this tough hunk of protein! To her credit though she offered to make us something else, which  I did appreciate, even after being backhandedly insulted... She brought us a flank steak which was lovely and flavourful (and served with an appropriate knife).

The rib/wing supplement was tasty but rather small for the price. The zucchini pecan cake was the star of the night! I actually wasn't looking forward to it as it didn't sound particularly interesting to me (not usually a fan of carrot or zucchini bread or cream cheese frosting) but it was AMAZING. So good.

Overall it was an okay meal with a number of hiccups. Definitely not as good as my past experiences there. I know food prices have gone way up since Ruby Watchco opened yet they've kept their price relatively the same, but I'd be willing to cough up extra $$ for the food to return to the way it was."}
{"text":"Amazing meal and service! I'm still thinking about it.

I went for dinner here with a friend in the summer, while she was visiting me in Toronto.  There is a $49 prix fixe menu, which is posted on the website, so you know exactly what you're having for dinner, not to mention it's local and fresh.   Also, if you're like me and have difficulty choosing what to eat when there are too many delicious-sounding things on the menu, this is ideal.  You start with bread and an amazing salad. The next is the main dish, which for us was the BC salmon, and then the cheese plate.  Everything was amazing, though the surprise hit for me here was the dessert.  I'm more of an appetizer and main entree kind of girl, but the dessert we had here (I believe it had the vanilla anglaise) was out of control amazing.  

I was so impressed with this restaurant - everything we ate was incredibly delicious, which each course just being more amazing than the previous.  The service was also fantastic, with excellent servers that knew their wine well.  Also, I loved that they took reservations, so you don't even have to wait.  If you have any food restrictions, I would recommend looking over the menu and letting them know when you make the reservation, so they can prepare you a different option, which they do also specifically ask you about on the phone.  

Quite possibly the best food experience I've had in Toronto! You should definitely go!"}
{"text":"I have returned a few times since my last review to Ruby Watchco. The visits have been slightly worse each time, so I thought a review update was in order.

On my most recent visit, I invited friends who were new to town to try it out. Here's how the experience went...and left me a bit disappointed, but also noticing a trend.

1. First, we had an 830 reservation. Since they were not ready to seat us, they left us out in the tiny entry area for 15 minutes while people came and went, stepping on our feet as we held the door for them. No apologies for the wait.
2. We were finally seated, but waited another 10 minutes for a server.
3. The cocktails were good and all 14$ each. The cherry bomb was excellent.
4. The first part of the 49$ (before tax and tip) meal was a delicious beet salad. Somehow, the salads can be the best part of the meal here and were again.
5. They served us 4 small biscuits with the salad as always. When one of my guests asked for another one, they were told they would be charged for it. (Our total bill was 500$, and we couldn't get one damn biscuit? Nope.)
6. The meal came. It was kale, heirloom carrots, celery root purÃ©e, and a small piece of salmon. Not exactly exciting or in any way a value for 49$.
7. The meal followed with four very small pieces of Quebec goat cheese and Chef Lora's chocolate bread pudding (which was memorable only for being forgettable.)
8. A cheaper bottle of wine and 6 cocktails brought the bill to 500$. 
9. Service was pleasant, but felt more like a sales role than a service role.

I think Lynn Crawford is awesome. She was not here on this visit or my visit before this one. However, I get the sense that they have plenty of business without mine, which kind of saddens me, because I have taken many people there (and even received a Review of the Day for hyping the place on Yelp!)

For a while, and in my old review, I considered Ruby Watchco to be one of the best restaurants in town. Now, I am backtracking from that. There are places that offer carrots, kale and fish for much less, as well as places that can wow for the same money.

If you haven't been and have plenty of money, maybe you should try it. The vibe is still loud and fun, even if the shine has faded a bit from the silver."}
{"text":"Five stars for this little gem! My dad and I went here last night for dinner, and we were blown away by our meals. We started off with lump crab served on pea cakes, which were surprisingly delicious. I don't know what they did to those peas, but they were buttery and smooth and just perfect. The crab was very good too, even for my dad, who isn't a huge fan of crab. 4.5/5 for the crab.

We also each ordered Sangrias. My dad liked his, but I found mine too bitter, which may be a reflection of my preference for incredibly sweet drinks as opposed to a comment on the drink itself...I asked them if they could add some syrup, which they did, and that made it a bit better. 3/5 for the Sangria.

Next we had a salad with melon and prosciutto, which was crispy like bacon, and absolutely divine. I'd never had prosciutto done that way before and it was delicious, perfectly balancing out the sweetness of the melon. Yum! 5/5 for the salad.

They also brought out some biscuits, which were absolutely to die for. Literally the best biscuits I have ever had, and after living in the south for awhile, I am obsessed with biscuits, and I make my own on a regular basis and get frequent compliments on them. But these...these biscuits blew mine out of the park. I have never had such a moist, creamy, fluffy biscuit in my entire life. They barely even needed butter. I gobbled mine up and almost gobbled my dad's up too, but he wouldn't let me. :( So I had to ask them to bring me another one. They gave me the recipe for the biscuits so I can make them myself, and I am very excited to try it out. 6/5 for the biscuits.

For our main course, we had flank steak with green onion on top. The green onion balanced out the steak very well. The steak itself was a bit tough, but very flavorful, and flank steak is naturally a bit tough, so I wouldn't hold that against them. 4/5 for the steak.

With the steak, they brought out potatoes, which were the only part of our meal that was just meh - nothing wrong with them, just ordinary potatoes. 3/5 for the potatoes. They also brought out yellow string beans, which were delicious! I have never had string beans so smooth and buttery and cooked just right...5/5 for those. 

Another 6/5 for the corn on the cob they also brought out. The corn literally blew me away. Corn is one of my favorite things, and I have it wherever I can, and my dad makes really great corn on the cob too, but this...the corn was out of this world. They grilled it with chipotle aioli, and it was so creamy and flavorful and just...guh...I have been dreaming about that corn all day today. I have never had such delicious corn in my entire life.

The next course was blue cheese, but neither my dad nor I are huge fans of blue cheese...we both tried it and found it way too \"blue\" for our tastes. So they took it away and brought us our final course, which was raspberry cheesecake with a chocolate \"crust.\" I hesitate to even call it a cheesecake - it was more like a cheese pudding. It was very thin and creamy, like a panna cotta (although I believe it was made from raspberry infused cream cheese), and the raspberry taste was very strong. It was an interesting concept and I enjoyed it, but the raspberry taste eventually was overpowering so I couldn't finish the whole thing. 4/5 for the cheesecake.

The wait staff were very attentive and the ambience is great for a nice dinner out. The price is also pretty reasonable, considering the quality of the food. Five stars for some of the yummiest food I have had in my life and some other interesting creations, and I can't wait to come back here and try some more!"}
{"text":"I am a meat guy, but all the vegetables there are so tasty and sweet. One of the best salad I ever had. Main course and all the sides are excellent, the rib eye is cooked perfectly and served mid-rare. Did not give 5 stars, cuz the dessert was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"One of the reasons I love this city so much is because of all the exquisite dining experiences available to us.
  
This was a lovely evening from front to back.  I was expecting this kind of experience.  Lynn Crawford did not disappoint.  

The custom tequila Diego Rivera cocktail (made me want to run out and catch the AGO exhibition) was slightly sweet and salty; a great way to begin.  I love that they just serve you dinner here, family style... there's no humming and hawing about what to order, they have daily 4-course menus that are clearly well thought out and executed.  

This night we dined on crispy braised rabbit salad (I had never tried rabbit before, had it not just been served to me I probably never would have) it was delicious.  Next was pan seared steelehead trout with dill tartar sauce.  This course had 4 sides (slaw, romaine hearts salad, roasted potatoes and a tomato feta salad).  Frankly it was too much.  Everything was delicious but just so much food!  We couldn't finish our portion, we needed to keep room for the Cheese course served with beets and butternut squash, and dessert which was over the top.  Dark chocolate ricotta cake with peanutbutter frosting.  It was ridiculous.  Neither of us could finish so we doggy bagged it.

The staff were all very attentive and personable; the space warm and inviting.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Great good. Nice atmosphere. Fixed menu is the  feature that i like.Went there for dinner and enjoyed every minute of my time. If you can't decide were to go then Ruby is your perfect choice for tonight. Sincerely"}
{"text":"This is my review of the reviews here on Yelp for Ruby Watchco. I have read through about 10 and have drawn a major conclusion. 

Th folks who gave the restaurant an excellent rating all seem to be really good writers. They all use the same format, first telling you about how good and amazing it is to eat this way, a la Ruby, and what famed celebrities they are. Then they tell you how amazing the restaurant is about accommodating food allergies. Then comes how abundantly friendly, attentive and funny the wait staff are, almost as if you're getting a live show as you dine. 

They all remember exactly what they ate, to the detail, using all the fancy food terms. Then comes the line about how fresh, fresh and fresh everything is, followed by a diner confessing that \"if I could dine there every night, I would\".  These folks are all gushing with compliments: one woman said she wanted to hug everyone after the meal - whatever.

The folks who gave it a not so good rating seemed to be more realistic. They said the wait staff were good but definitely nothing to go viral about. What they said most is that the food is bland and lacking in flavour. It's probably beautifully presented, fresh, local, and prepared or at least overseen by Ruby but mostly bland and not flavorful. Which is okay if that's what you're after, fresh food, prepared simply by Celebrity Lynn and presented beautifully. 

Draw your own conclusions or dine there and write a review."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place 3.5 stars if possible. I have been looking forward to trying this place in awhile and actually really wanted to give it a higher rating but unfortunately, none of the food really wow'ed me. 

The atmosphere was nice...albeit a bit loud sometimes but the lighting was cozy and there was enough space between the tables.  The servers were also attentive and friendly.  Never had to wait too long in between dishes or getting my bill despite the place being pretty much full on a Saturday evening. 

To start, we had the heirloom and watermelon salad. The taste was alright but it didn't seem like anything too special...there was a bit of a bitter taste to the salad that I wasn't a huge fan of and I don't think there were more than two or three pieces of watermelon. 

For our entree, we had some pork loin with some green beans, corn salad, potatoes and zucchini. I found the sides actually better than the pork loin. Again, the food was tasty but I kind of felt it was something I could make at home myself if I really wanted to.  The pork loin itself didn't have much flavor to it I found. 

Our third course was some cheese plate with cheddar cheese which I wasn't a huge fan of. 
For dessert we had the Apricot Cheesecake which was probably the biggest letdown.  I was really looking forward to this but when it came out, I found the apricot topping too sweet and the cheesecake part too mushy. It was a no-bake cheesecake but it seemed like they hadn't let the cheesecake sit long enough for it to solidify.  

I will probably come back again to give this place another try given it's received great reviews from so many other people but probably not anytime soon. Maybe I just came on a bad night!"}
{"text":"I was invited out for dinner on Saturday night to--Food Network Canada's \"up and coming\" celebrity chef--Lynn Crawford's restaurant, Ruby Watch Co.

After a few years of slugging it out on Restaurant Makeover, Crawford has been elevated to a new status of Canadian Celeb Chef that her other friends from the show probably won't see. I've never watched Pitchin' In mainly because I'm not that huge of a fan of the Lynn, but I was excited to try out her new restaurant and see if she practices what she preaches.

The restaurant concept is simple: each day, Lynn's staff posts the menu for that particular day, and everyone eats the same meal. It gets rid of all that unease in having to pick a dish that you think will be good. Instead, everyone gets the exact same meal for a fixed price.

Saturday's menu consisted of a crispy chicken salad which was just salty enough to taste amazing, and was definitely crispy. Flank steaks with avocado frites (!!! - she actually deep fried the avocado. This was delish, especially when you coupled it with the steak). A cheese course with bread, and then a plum tart for desert.

The concept that kicks it up a notch is how the food is served. Everyone eats from generously portioned out bowls and plates just like you would at home. Rather than serving everyone their own dish, customers are encouraged to dig into the bowls of food and serve each other. It's a great concept, and it could only work if the food is great as well.

All the food is local. Lynn makes a big deal out of supporting farmers and merchants within the province and country to build her menu items. The restaurant itself is a great place, and fits in well with the whole Riverside community. It is a little pricey, though.

8.5/10."}
{"text":"this is a highly rated rest and we were excited to experience. it was highly underwhelming. there is a fixed price menu 4 courses that started with a nice salad which wasn't anything special. average 8-11 dollar salad that you see even at canteen- tiff building - second course wasa steak meal which was quite nice along with veggies, third and fourth course were nothing of note: cheese and beat followed by a very average pana cotta. the price per person after tax and tip without alcohol was 71!! highly overrated. this meal should not have been more than 40 bucks anywhere else.
service wasnt anything special. i wouldnt go back to this resto. you get a much better bang for your buck elsewhere in the city"}
{"text":"Ruby Watchco is a unique dining experience, that's for sure! Make sure you check ahead and like everything on the menu on the night you are going, as the restaurant is a family-style experience in which Lynn plans the menu and there is no choice (although the menu does say they'll accommodate vegetarians and some dietary restrictions).

Decor: Simple, rustic, and inviting. It was a bit loud and bustling, but i think that added to the family-like experience. The staff are very knowledgeable about everything being served, happy to describe everything to you, and can make excellent recommendations regarding your wine pairings and drinks. 

Food: Our salad was a wonderful salmon on greens with a Green Goddess dressing, and it was a hefty portion for just an appetizer. It was fresh and tangy, and my only regret is not hounding the waiter to get me the recipe for the dressing. The brick chicken was cooked perfectly, it fell so nicely off the bone and was so flavourful, and there was more than enough for everyone at the table to enjoy especially with the sides. 

We opted for the optional chicken wing side, and man those were delicious. I didn't even feel like i was in chicken overload from the main course, as they had their own distinct flavouring. I also enjoyed the artisanal cheese selection of brie with the honey drizzle. The dessert was oozing with personality too, with a \"ninja\" shortbread and raspberry jelly.

Service: Friendly, knowledgeable, and not the least bit pesky. 

Extra: Added bonuses to the evening included the waiter dancing over with sparklers over his head for the birthday girl in our party, and of course, the presence of Lynn Crawford there that evening! We had a nice chat with her, and it was great to see how hands-on she was with the kitchen staff and greeting her staff. 

Overall: Perhaps a bit pricey for a causal night out, but for a special night and different type of dining experience, it's absolutely worth it. I will absolutely be back and would not hesitate to recommend Ruby Watchco to anyone. The hype is real!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, fresh and local.  The way things work here is a set menu that changes almost daily.  As long as you are not picky, you will love it here.  They will accommodate allergies and vegetarians.  This is a must try restraunt in Toronto."}
{"text":"First time to Ruby Watchco last night...and although I have mixed feelings...it still deserves a 4 in my books. Great atmosphere & excellent service.

Portion sizes are excellent (not a restaurant that leaves you hungry for a burger after dinner!). I'm usually not a fan of fixed price menus...reminds me of tourist trap restaurants...but this is definitely not one of those. 

First course: Caesar Salad w 5-Minute Hen Egg & Biscuits. -- The salad was a little bit too salty for my liking, but still very good. 

For the main course, they were able to accommodate our dietary restrictions, but I feel that we missed out on the true experience and variety (which is why I have mixed feelings...aka jealousy!!). Instead of the suasage and baby back ribs, i was given 3 pieces of the Spicy Brick Chicken. Not nearly as spicy as I would have liked it, but cooked to perfection. My gf doesn't eat any meat and was given halibut instead...very, very good. 

Third Course...at this point, we are stuffed but somehow managed to scarf down the 5-yr aged cheddar - served with house made pickle and honey mustard. Completely unecessary, but totally devoured.

And for dessert...peaches and cream pavlova. For someone who does't have much of a sweet tooth, there wasn't a single leftover on my plate! Different and delicious!

Didn't get a chance to try any of the cocktails...but will definitely be back for another round at Ruby!"}
{"text":"So, imagine this: Chef Lynn Crawford has invited you over for dinner. And she has crafted a menu just for the evening. Paying homage to fresh, local ingredients, a four-course culinary feast is being whipped up in the back kitchen. For you. Served family-styles, in heavy, red casserole dishes, think home cooking at its best. Yes, help yourself. And be generous...there's enough for everybody ;)

Overwhelming consensus. Exceptionally good food. Matched by equally impressive service. Rarely will I comment, unless it was abominable or outstanding...and it was wonderful. Ever walk in a restaurant to encounter that refined-perky-nose-in-air judgement? The worst. Not the case with Ruby.

Our hostess was charming, and our server was lovely and attentive...didn't miss a detail...and if a crumb was left behind, discreetly taken care of by co-owner Joey Skeir seconds later. Atmosphere? Engaging, charged and lively. We had a bloody great time. Best experience in a while.

Our menu for the eve:

ONTARIO ASPARAGUS & HARICOT VERT PANZELLA SALAD
Heirloom Tomatoes, Halloumi Cheese Croutons, Creemore Radishes, Rose Bella Cerignola Olive Vinaigrette

{we were fighting over those croutons)

GREY WEST PREMIUM TRI-TIP STEAK WITH GREEN GARLIC BUTTER
Button Mushroom & Boston Lettuce with Blue Cheese Dressing, Smashed Thompson Farm's Yukon Gold Potatoes, Darling Honey Glazed Carrots

{um. steak. medium-rare. good. that's all.
reduced to one word sentences good.
blue cheese. not a fan...still not a fan. and salad was salt-y. pourquoi? je ne sais pas.
best smashed potatoes you'll ever taste. true story.}

GLENGARRY FINE CHEESE'S BIG BROTHER
Spiced Mixed Nuts & Homemade Orange Marmalade

{who loves cheese? we do! forget the nuts & marma. vino was perfect with it}

RUBY'S CHOCOLATE CHIP SLIDERS
Ed's Real Scoop Stracciatella Gelato

{ok. our only disappointment. not rave-worthy.  expected a warm, gooey mess. minutes out of oven mess. we got hard la-gourmand-style-cookie-muffins that just confused us. we couldn't break into it. do we pick it up? eat it with our hands? throw it back in the oven? what to do?!}

FYI: The menu changes every night, every week. If you're an obsessive planner - or simply curious - you'll be able to see the week's menu on their site. Other option: opt in & get daily menu e-mails. My personal choice of food porn, every morning.

The vibe in the back is slightly different from the front; a little closer to the heart of the action. Plus, all the better to admire the Ruby Watch Co. sign, which is by far, the most arresting fixture in the restaurant. That, or Chef Lynn, herself.

So if she's inviting you over for dinner, you can't turn her down. Nor, would you want to ;)"}

{"text":"The food was good here. The staff are amazing. I came in November so it was around the time of the U.S. Thanksgiving so they had a set menu of turkey dinner with all the trimmings. It loses one star as it was all share plates which not crazy about. Drinks were pretty expensive. Definitely worth a visit though."}
{"text":"First class restaurant. 
A must visit. Loved everything from the wine to the service. 
The food was amazing. A few items blew me away. 
Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"When I'm told about a movie that is amazing, friends tell me about that same movie that completely changed their lives, there is media hype, I build up a certain expectation for my own experience.  More often than not, it falls far short. 

Ruby Watch Co. I have lived in Leslieville for a couple of years, and the name has come up more than a couple of times. For whatever reason, I have not had the pleasure of dining in this establishment until now. Tonight was the night.

Being completely hopeless with directions, my dining companion and I were relying heavily on the map on my iphone. Even though I'm quite familiar with the area, I just could not visualize where it was. The little pin was totally not where Ruby actually was! There is only so many times that one can walk past Jilly's without feeling somewhat...odd. 

Needless to say, we regained our bearings, and strolled in to meet our friends exactly on time for our reservation.  It was only 6:30 and the place was fairly humming with happy patrons. Our waiter greeted us in a timely fashion, giving us time to take off our jackets and say our hellos. 

The best thing about the prix fixe menu is the only thing you have to think about is what you are drinking. I had my standard vodka soda, which I have to say was served in a lovely shaped glass.  I felt a little rushed with the wine that we ordered with our meal, but I attribute it to the attentiveness of our server. (I was, after all, a little behind in drinking my pre-dinner cocktail).  I chose the wine based on the suggestion of pairing on the main.
The (red) wine had subtle fruity undertones with a smoky punch. I wish I could remember the name.  

Our first course was a wedge of iceberg lettuce with egg, delightfully sliced radish, thickly cut bacon (I'm sure they called it something else), oven kissed tomato with one thousand and one island dressing. The extra island was for the chili heat that they added to the dressing. Refreshing, delicious, certainly got me salivating. 

They also served chive and cheddar biscuits with the salad. They were still warm, broke apart perfectly in half, and were absolutely amazing. I could have eaten 17 of them. I probably will be dreaming about them tonight. 

The servers swooped in and cleared our (licked clean) plates in the most unobtrusive manner. Our glasses were carefully monitored and topped when needed. 

The main arrived. I'm ten years past the acronym generation but OMG. We had black kale (described on the menu as winter greens with creamed brown butter sauce, butternut squash with pumpkin seed pesto, smashed potato with shallots and blue cheese, and....beef flank, seared to perfection, with this wonderful smoky flavour that wasn't overbearing. It showcased the flavour of the beef. Seriously, it made my toes curl. The only thing that I could find wrong with this meal was that the meat was a little cold. Sadness. Very difficult to control though, as the room had a little bit of a cold breeze, and the meat was obviously intended to be served a certain way.  Our server dropped in and made sure that everyone got some of the delicious jus on their plate. 

Third Course; in preparation for the dessert, we received some sort of mild and sweet cheese (I didn't remember the name of the wine, I'm certainly not going to remember the name of the cheese after all that diligent glass topping). Along with the cheese, lightly toasted bread and fruity chutney rounded out the plate. 

Our friend (the birthday girl, the reason we went out) happened to not care for chocolate cake, which was being served as the dessert.  Our server accommodated her eagerly, and gave her a beautifully poached pear with cranberry and a sparkler. He even snapped a picture with his blackberry, handed it to me, and told me to email it to myself and my friends! The chocolate ganache was to die for.  

My only other complaint of the night was when I ordered an espresso, and they didn't have any Sambuca to go with it. The espresso was quite good. 

The place was tastefully decorated and down to earth, eclectic yet homely. Even in the washroom, the toilet paper rolled on a \"pipe\" that was crafted to appear as though it was some plumbing that went awry. Awesome!

All in all, a great night. Lynn Crawford was busy helping cleaning tables to turn them as we left, which is quite admirable!! Nice guys/gals don't always finish last!  I am delighted to be surprised that Ruby Watch Co. lived up to all of the hype and then some."}
{"text":"It definitely pays to do your research before going to Ruby Watchco. Every night is the same prix fixe menu, so if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, you definitely want to check the menu before making a reservation or deciding to stop in. It's not a place I would go to on a whim, because of this, and the fact it's not going to be a cheap meal you want to make sure you leave satisfied.

Some reviews mentioned that they charge for water, and that is true. For the 2 of us it was 3 dollars for all the Q Water we could drink. So not so terrible. Maybe if the group is larger they charge more?

The prix fixe menu started with a fresh salad. There was lots going on it, and there was lots of fun textures. It was also very pretty to look at. The taste wasn't as memorable as the appearance and texture. I would say that the restaurant might be a little too dim because you can't see some of the beautiful work done on the food. For me, and most people, food is an experience that uses a variety of senses.

The main meal was the highlight for me. The brick chicken with lemon tea gravy was quite delicious. It was more tasty the more I ate it. The flavours were subtle and became more evident with each bite. I do think it's hard to make something that just gets better with each bite. The broccoli drenched in bacon butter was fabulous. It was saturated with unhealthy but delicious flavours. The sweet potato dish was also quite excellent. Carrots with rosemary and honey is a simple yet effective presentation.

I loved the cheese course. It came with yogurt and little mushrooms. Never thought of eating cheese with sides like that, but it was satisfying. I also really love cheese.

For dessert was a stout cake. I thought it might have been a little on the dry side. There was some caramel sauce on top of an orange meringue, but needed more of it. Overall it was a great meal, and any faults you could find with it was very small."}
{"text":"Great service and ambience.

Food was below average, very unimpressed. Halibut tasted \"fishy\", duck confit was oversalted. Nothing stood out as great or even good.

Pricey and completely underwhelming food experience

**try prohibition gastropub next door!!** the duck fat taster tots were better than anything at ruby watchco"}
{"text":"I'd been monitoring the rotating menu for a few weeks, and decided on one that appealed to me. I obviously misread it, because I thought the feature was crab. Oops! When we arrived at RW on June 17th, we were hesitant about the featured fish (fogo island cod!), but we decided to keep our 6:30pm reservation. We weren't served water or menus right away, but once the waiter came, we jumped right into drink orders, including a savoury cucumber mint cocktail for me. Yum! 

The fixed price menu is $54pp for 4 courses, and everything is served 'family style'. We decided to splurge and add on the optional snow crab cocktail (+$18)...it was worthwhile and came quickly with the first course of eggplant/quinoa salad and some garlic butter scones.

The main cod came with 3 sides: 1) warm carrot/arugula 2) sweet potatoes 3) asparagus with parma aioli + prosciutto. All were amazing, and tied together with dill and mustardy flavours.

I was a bit surprised to see only 2 small servings of cheese for the next course, but we were also stuffed, so it made a lot of sense. The cheddar and gouda were served with lemon jelly and burned oranges/almonds. Delish!

Finally, by the time the cheesecakes came out (1 for each of us), we were done. The whipped cheesecakes were okay, but I just didn't have any more room. I also wasn't a huge fan of the red-wine caramel on top of it.

Overall, a great dining experience...both food and service. It definitely exceeded our expectations, and was worth the higher price-tag."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Was very excited to actually get in, had struck out a few times on nights where the menu was something I really i wanted to try. Thought the price was very reasonable, $49 is great for the calibre of food and presentation. Only semi complaint was that it was very loud, but the place was packed and there was a large group of cackling women, so no real drawback of the restaurant. Does not take AmEx as well. Will definitely return.
Brilliant experience though, especially since Lynn brought our salad to the table lol
She was quite involved with the whole place, chatting with people at the door, checking each entree as it comes out, behind the bar.
Best thing to do, is sign up on their website, and keep on eye when the weekly menu is posted to make your reservation."}
{"text":"You Gotta Eat Here! This place is incredible! Chef Lynn puts together the most remarkable menu that is made with so much Love! The food is so fresh, and seasoned perfectly. The waiter was very knowledgable, friendly, and made the best recommendations. The restaurant was very clean, and packed with tons of people. They have two seatings per night at 6:30 and 8:30. It's a unique dining experience and if you are lucky you might even get to meet Chef Lynn like I did!  The salad was dressed perfectly, the rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and only Chef Lynn can make brocolli taste Amazing! So worth it!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Even when the menu items read like things that I don't care for, when it comes to the table, every dish is delicious and thoughtfully executed. Seriously, everything from the salad to the cheese is yum. They don't just grill something and put it on a plate.  You don't eat a bite and think to yourself - hmm... I think I can make this at home.
Like the other Yelpers said, Ms Crawford is often working away, which is always nice to see.  It also makes me happy to think that this must be what she actually loves to do, and what's not to like about food that's prepared by someone who cares?
No it's not cheap, especially with a few drinks, but it's well worth it and it's a lot of food.  Most of the time we pack leftovers and my coworkers look at my lunch with envy the next day. And really, the prices are competitive to places with similar ambiance and atmostphere. 
It's a nice place to get together with friends or have a meal with your significant other. The vibe here is casual and relaxed, with class. So recommended."}
{"text":"I was so excited to be there and through the course of the dinner became disappointed. Full disclosure I was last there in Oct 2013 and my friend was paying. 
1- making a reservation was an ordeal! There was 3 back and forth voice messages just to confirm my reservation - waste of my time! Reserve at least 1 wk in advance. 
2- waiters/waitresses were dressed in obnoxious Halloween costumes which were annoying 
3- it felt less about service and felt more like our waiter was interrupting us and taking the focus away from us and making it about him 
4- delicious beer salad and my date doesn't typically eat salad and even he liked it. 
5- slow roasted pork with heirloom carrots and kale and other sides. The pork was dry and lacked flavour. The sides were deelish. 
6- I was really looking forward to the cheese plate and it was fine. 
7- I ordered 2 glasses of wine and my friend ordered 3. 
8- dessert: presentation was cute in a mason jar. I love sweets but found the dessert to be unsatisfying. 
9- I called 2 days later to complain about my disappointment with the main course and the operating manager did nothing other than return my call and thank me for my feedback. 
10- our bill with wine and a tea came to $250 + tip (disappointed with service all around and with food after hearing so much about both) 
11- When they brought us our coats they forgot my date's briefcase luckily he remembered. 

If budget is NOT an issue - it's worth trying once. The menu changes daily so choose a day where you like the entree (avoid the dry & bland slow roasted pork)."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place. I actually wasn't even aware of this restaurant until a friend brought me here for my birthday under another friend's recommendation. It was $65 per person prix fixe menu. The salad and scones were good but not delicious. The main was the fail. We literally had two -what tasted like- soy sauce drumsticks that my grandma can make better per person, a side of beets, a side of couscous (it was some sort of grainy mash which i think was couscous) plus another side of eggplants. The dessert was a mille-feuille which i normally love but theirs was soggy and tasteless. I expected a lot more from Lynn Crawford's restaurant. If you're making people eat what you decide we should eat for that day, it should be the best things you have to offer. It wasn't. NOT IMPRESSED."}
{"text":"Know before you book:  they have one menu only (see it online week of), you can ask for a veg option.  They serve family style and portions are \"just right\" (not generous).  We had dinner on a Tuesday evening. The menu was salad with eggplant, flank steak, and the dessert was berries with pound cake.

The salad was flavourful and a large portion. The steak was OK, sides were quite good - mac & cheese, green beans with tomato aioli and an arugula salad. 

The cheese course was nice. Dessert was as I expected - not to my liking as I don't like pound cake no matter who makes it.

Hubby had the wine flight which we thought was quite reasonable (4 servings of wine) for $39, dinner $54 per person. I had a \"virgin\" drink which was rhubarb infused simply syrup and something else - it was very tasty. 

Service was good. We were pleasantly full at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was warm and friendly, but I guess I was expecting this to feel like more of a dining experience. There was a disconnect between the family style gimmick and the impersonal feel of the ambience. The restaurant is much louder and larger and less cozy and romantic than I had expected. (It also didn't help that we were first seated basically in the hallway to the kitchen, and then waited 15 min to be reseated next to the flatware/cutlery station... So every 3 min a waiter would come by right next to our table and rummage loudly through a drawer of forks and knives. Not very intimate!) The food was great, there's no denying it, and it was a relief not to have to decide what to order. The wine pairings were also excellent. I don't think it was worth the price though, and it is unlikely that we will return."}
{"text":"The only reason I've taken off a star is because the coke is $5. That is the biggest rip off of life (and the waiter agreed). This was also my first time so I can't discuss consistency. Otherwise, Ruby Watchco is A +++++. 

VIBE 
Ruby (as I will be affectionately calling the restaurant throughout this review) is lovely in its simplicity.  From the cheerful but not saccharine reservations agent to the theatrical waitstaff, this place has got it going on in spades. Great for small groups of 4 but also for deuces too. The banquets are comfortable, the place is busy but you never feel rushed. It's a good Saturday night restaurant to be at. 

WE ATE/DRANK
The menu changes nightly but it's all home cooking/farm to table fare so you feel like you've gotten your five a day. The menu is hearty. I'm writing this three hours after my meal and I'm still full! You definitely get your money's worth here. 

First of all the biscuits here are to die for! All made in house with house made butter. If you like chives and buttermilk, you're in for a treat. 

We started off with a big bowl of spicy pink shrimp salad, had Ruby's brick chicken with red onion marmalade, roasted sweet potato, butternut squash and gala apples, rosemary roasted fingerling potatoes, and charred romaine hearts with parmesean dressing. We were quite impressed at this point by the heartiness and vibe of the meal. I wasn't a fan of the charred romaine but everything else was fantastic. 

A note that on the menu, there are wine accompaniments with each course. We had the Verdichhio Podium 2009, Garofoli. It was not a cheap glass of wine at $15 but it was a big glass that was crispy yet dry and went very well with the meal. 

We moved on to a robust Canadian artisinal cheese (one for each of us) with brandied date jam, honey and roasted pistachios. It was a nice segue into dessert and gave us enough time to digest our main meal. 

The dessert was fantastic as well. Aptly titled \"Chocolate Deliciousness\" it hit all the right notes: brownie. Check. Milk chocolate mousse. Check. Chocolate meringue kisses. Check.  That said, dessert really did us in! But hey, it's winter. So why not?!

Everything was spaced out well, all servers helped each other out and the food was fresh, bountiful and filling. Regardless of what the meal is next time, I will be back! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Watch out now: Ruby Watchco is one of Leslieville's best restaurants. A bit pricey. Hoping they'll mark down the coke price to $3 (even then it's a rip off but I'm willing to compromise). Regardless, all elements work to make a memorable dining experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

I was super excited to take my hubby to ruby watchco for his early birthday dinner but i ended up being a TAD disappointed. 
The service was great for the most part, but I couldn't help but feel a bit neglected compared to the other parties there.
We were literally ALWAYS last to have our food taken and the last ti get food as well. 
One of the waitresses seemed to tend to others much more than us. 
Don't get me wrong, they are very kind.. i just really wanted some more attention !! 

Anyway, the food was almost perfect. The appetizer, pate, cheese platter and dessert were all delicious. Unfortunately the main course with the salmon was very plain. 
The main course just kind of dragged the meal a bit but it was overall an 8/10 meal. 

I will 100% give this restaurant another try and update my review. 

Ps. It is a TAD expensive 
We ordered an additional appetizer and 2 drinks and our bill came to $200. 
I would say the range is anywhere from $130 -230 for 2 people (tax & tip incl.)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Expensive but delicious. Celerity chef Lynne Crawford was working the night we were there. Our bartender/server was awesome. Food was delicious, wine was delicious, filtered water (Q Water), friendly staff... Such a great experience! 

I highly recommend it. It's definitely not cheap but I found it worth it for sure. You can pay the same at other places and not get such a great experience. 

I love it and can't wait to go back but obviously it's not a place I should make too much of a habit of frequenting unless I want to go broke!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Ruby planning my birthday party! 

As many reviewers have already mentioned, the food is GOOD. REALLY GOOD! The family style portions are plentiful so even though we had a lot of big eaters, (ahem, me), everyone was full! 

They were great about dietary requirements - we had two non-pork eaters in the group, and even though there was pork in the menu that evening they accommodated them easily and they still had plenty to eat.

What really makes Ruby special is the great service - I had brought little party hats and our server immediately got into the spirit, asked if she could wear one too and wore it all night, pointing out to other guests that it was my birthday.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ruby for large or small groups!!"}
{"text":"Got to try very unique and flavourful dishes that I haven't had anywhere else. If you have any dietary restrictions, check their website for their set menu before making a reservation. This place also has a great atmosphere with a small candle on each table, which seems perfect for a date night. The four-course meal we got was sooooo delicious, except for one dish that we both didn't like. I could tell that each dish was prepared carefully with an understanding of how everything would taste together in mind. The portions were good and the whole meal was an excellent value for what we got.

As for an appetizer, heirloom carrot salad was really good. I liked the carrots, yum. I wondered if they blanched the carrots; then roasted them. I enjoyed the texture and sweet flavour as well as the distinctly intact carrot taste. The salad came with some biscuits and butter. The top of the biscuits were coated with something sweet and were shiny. 

Our main dish, hanger steak was delicious, but it was cooked to rare, a little too bloody for my liking. Some parts of the meat were a little chewy as well. The steak came with a dish of banana-flavoured parsnips, a broccoli dish, and a dish of roasted potatoes. We both didn't like our third dish, St Honore by Fromagerie Alexis De Portneuf. It has an impressive name lol. It was some cheese thing with a cherry tomato on top that was an interesting mix of sour, salty and sweet flavours. It was too strong of a mixture of different tastes and I left mine uneaten after few bites. The waiter was like, \"C'mon. Only few more bites,\" but sorry, I couldn't gulf that down. For the main dish, there were options to get either lobster or foie gras. 

The dessert, chocolate lover's delight was amazing. I liked how it wasn't too sweet. It was a perfect dessert to complete a wonderful meal. 

It was nice that the restaurant had the same menu for both the 13th and the 14th for couples eating out on the Valentine's weekend. This place was filled with couples on dates. Very cute. It would be a great place to come for its candle-lit trendy atmosphere and delicious dinner. One of Canadian celebrity chefs, Lynn Crawford opened this place. Her food did not disappoint. The communal everyone-eats-the-same-meal is also a cool experience. They only offer prix-fixe dinner ($54 per person)."}
{"text":"My actual rating is 4.5. 

Tonight I had a second opportunity to dine at Ruby Watchco.  I held off reviewing until now because I wanted two kicks at the Watchco can before offering up my final verdict.  So here it goes:

This time we had a much better table.  Last time we had a good vantage of Lynn Crawford checking and finessing each dish, but we were in the path of the most  heavy traffic flow so I felt jostled.  Also, for four of us on a small round table, it was a squeeze, and especially because of all the extra dishes associated with family style dining, I wasn't a fan.  Tonight the table was perfect.  Good size, good location, totally comfortable.  No loss on the view since Crawford was AWOL as far as I saw.  Personally, I'd request a table with bench seating along a wall from here on out.

The menu tonight was solid with the exception of the dessert which was a let down.   The watercress and endive salad with crispy prosciutto was delicious.  The flank steak had a amazing charred flavour and I enjoyed it.  The veggies were okay, but not mind blowing.  I did really enjoy the cheese course.  The blue cheese was top notch and the salted pears totally complimented it, as one would expect.  Once I got over the initial unusual flavour of the scorched bread accompanying the cheese, it worked perfectly.  I'd go so far as saying I would have gladly doubled up on this course and passed on dessert.

Our server was efficient though not exactly warm.  I personally think he could have been a little more personable to really make this dinning experience exceptional.  He did recommend a Chianti that  wasn't on the regular wine list.  At $62 a bottle, it was okay, but it had a slightly corked smell that made me a bit wary.
.
Overall, it was a good dinner.  But I think Ruby's service was better last time I went.  It's not a cheap meal, so I guess I just hoped to walk away WOWED by something.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We booked Ruby Watchco for my birthday dinner this year (29 and feeling fine!).  I had also been sitting on a gift card that I had received from last year's birthday gift!

Arrived for our 6pm seating on a Saturday night and first impressions - loved the cozy space and spotted Lynn Crawford working the pass.  We were seated at a table for 2 beside the dreaded plate/utensil cupboard in afore mentioned reviews but I didn't find it to be too bad.

Our server went over the set menu ($54 per person) and took our drink orders.  We decided to go with the wine pairings for the meal at $39 per person.  On the menu tonight was Ruby's Caesar salad, beef tenderloin, a cheese course and lemon panna cotta dessert.  We also ordered the additional appetizer of beef tartare ($18).

The first issue of the night was when our main came - our food runner delivered two delicious looking beefy hunks of meat with sides of fingerling potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.  I was prepared to dig in when we noticed that our wine pairing had not arrived.  

We decided to wait for the wine...and wait, and wait.  Our server finally noticed us about 15 min. after our food arrived and brought over our wine (with very little apology).  By now, the meat and sides were cold.  I'm not that guy to send back an entree so we ate it anyway.  Mood slightly soured but night not completely ruined...yet.

Cheese course came next, along with a more timely glass of wine.

And then the lemon panna cotta dessert with shortbread cookie which was the perfect end to the meal.

When we received our bill, we noticed that the beef tartare was incorrectly billed at $22.  We mentioned this to our server and she was not happy.  We watched her snatch the bill from our table, rush to the back, speak angrily at the kitchen staff and then huff all the way from the register back to our table.  

No apologies, just attitude from the server leaving me with a feeling that I had been \"Pretty Woman-ed\".  We can afford to eat here, we're just not happy when mistakes are made on our bill.

If I wanted to be judged and made to feel inferior on my birthday, I would have had dinner at my parents' house, and it would not have cost us $250+.  

Food and wine was overall great but it's hard to enjoy when the service was bitter and inattentive.  I think it was just that one server in particular, not the entire staff because we did have some nice interactions with the food runner and guy who took away our empty dishes.  Just not worth it to me to go back and play server roulette."}
{"text":"I've always had an amazing meal here. The experience is great with extremely friendly staff and every time I've been Lynn Crawford has been there making it extra special."}
{"text":"Ruby Watchco is like a blast from the past. The food is cooked with old-school, tired culinary techniques straight out a Julia Child or \"The Joy of Cooking\" cookbook. The ambiance follows suite. The music is a kitschy selection of tired 60's to 80's tunes. This is the sort of dining experience you would expect to find on an old episode of \"The Love Boat\" or a 1980 wedding party. Case and point: there is a set menu every night. No options, exchanges or substitutions.  Also, the ingredients are meager. It's as if they are trying to serve a large group of diners on a minimal budget. The prix-fixe is $54 per person, which is highway robbery for what you get. See details below.

1st course - NIAGARA CONCORD GRAPE SALAD
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rating: 3/5

The small portion of salad to share between two diners was not nearly large enough. The salad was OK, but made with minimal effort. The hyped-up marinated grapes tasted like regular grapes. Almonds were a cheap substitute to a more appropriate nut. The salad was screaming for a little goat cheese or blue cheese but why would you, when you try to minimize on expenses. The dressing was a tired old \"Brown Derby\" dressing. Like I said: blast from the past. Still, the salad was the highlight of the night. Things kept getting progressively worse.

Main course - RUBY ROASTED CHICKEN 
-----------------------------------------------------
Rating: 1/5

First of all, chicken - of all proteins - screams low budget. Even at a wedding, you'd be embarrassed to serve such a cheap protein. And yet, that would have been excused, had they done justice to the humble bird. Instead, the meat was over-cooked. The flavors where tired and pedestrian. Each diner got a quarter chicken, not impressive considering the price of $54 per person. Hardly a good value for your money. There were 3 sides. One side was 6 stems of broccoli, which tasted burnt. It was advertised on the menu as Anna's best brocolli. I don't know who Anna is (and I'm not sure I really care) but if that's her best brocolli, I don't care to try her regular offering. A second side was a handful of cubed, baked celery root. Like I said - minimal cost. The third side was a carrot salad that was surprisingly good (with a little kick of jalapeno.) Overall, the main was a big flop. If you had ordered a $10 whole roast chicken from your local rotisserie, you'd have a much better meal that could feed a family of 4.
 
Cheese course - \"ARTISANAL\" CHEESE
---------------------------------------------------
Rating: 1/5

There was nothing artisianal about this simple piece of cheddar! Balderson cheddar would have been just as good. Plus, the piece was embarrassingly small for two diners.  The plum puree was wonky and the hazelnuts made no sense. The raisin puree was blah. 

Dessert - CHEF LORA'S CHOCOLATE CAKE
---------------------------------------------------------
Rating: 1/5

Like Anna (the aforementioned, famed broccoli lady), I'm not sure I care for the name of the chef who made my cake. What I do care is that it was a plain piece of brownie with no redeeming quality. There was a comical smear of egg white froth, slightly charred with a burner. How 80's can you get?  Another desert was a chunk of old school meringue. Why people in the 70's-80's chose to eat this Styrofoam, I do not know. Needless to say, we didn't waste our calories on the deserts.

Where is the love?"}
{"text":"Husband took me here for my birthday (its become a tradition) and everything was wonderful. Their first course salad is always so delicious, and tastes so \"alive\" as the description would suggest. Second course I had seared arctic char (husband had filet mignon) and both were fantastic. The plating is always such a treat, and I love the family style serving style. The sides included a baked turnip that was to die for. Third course - beet carpaccio (YUM) and beautiful aged cheddar were wonderful (and such a generous size we took a piece of cheese home) and the apple cake (which the husband was doubtful of) was a highlight of the meal, with fresh, thick, goat yogurt. Meal was absolutely incredible from start to finish and the service is always so pleasurable. Love this place with all my heart - only downside is Chef Lynn wasn't there to sign my evening menu, which I've had the pleasure of asking for in the past few years (and which she always kindly agrees to)."}
{"text":"Are you one of those people who never knows what to order at a restaurant because everything looks sooo good? Well, Ruby takes that problem away from you. Like the famed Chez Panisse in Berkeley, one menu per day, pre-fixe ($49 for a four course meal), and you have no choice.

My friends and I ordered a bottle of prosecco to go along with our celebratory dinner (I was back in town and well, hanging out with me is always a cause for celebration, right?). 

We had a lovely roasted beets, arugula and goat cheese salad. Ruby Watchco tries to get all locally grown and organic ingredients. You could really taste the freshness of the beets. The crunch of the pistachio added a nice texture and contrast to the softness of the other ingredients. I love the sweet tangy vinaigrette. 

When the second course came, one of our friends stepped away and the waiter asked if he should come back later when our table was complete. We answered flatly to give us our food now and that it was \"every woman for herself. If there's no steak when she comes back, well, then it's her bad.\"

The steak came medium (again we didn't ask for it. They know what they're doing and will give you the food cooked properly.) The sides were grilled asparagus with roasted garlic butter, potatoes, beefsteak tomato panzanella salad, and bacon & zucchini risotto.

The steak was really juicy. The slices were at different degrees of mediumness, so we all picked out which slices we wanted. The ones who wanted a more rare side got the thicker middle pieces and the ones who wanted a drier medium got the end pieces. We were all happy. The only fault I had was that the au jus was too salty.

The asparagus was at the perfect level of cookedness. Just tender enough to easily be eaten, but still has a snap and crispness. Until I reread the menu, I had no idea that there was roasted garlic butter on the asparagus. More please!

The beefsteak tomato panzanella salad is a tomato and bread salad. Cube of stale bread soak up the juices from the tomato and vinegar, soften up and add a heartiness to the dish. 

The bacon & zucchini risotto was amazing. I love bacon. I love zucchini. I love well-made risotto (just right at al dente). I didn't want to share this dish with my friends and I made sure that I ate the last scrapings of this dish. The crisp saltiness of the bacon paired beautifully with the sweet zucchinis. 

Last but not least was the dessert -- strawberry and rhubarb chocolate fool. Well, you'd be a fool to miss this. Triple chocolate brownies with vanilla cream, and a strawberry and rhubarb compote. Yum! We were stuffed, but luckily dessert has a special empty stomach. The brownies were really rich, but not cloyingly sweet.

A delicious meal and a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"They advertise \"Market inspired comfort food\" and I would add... with a twist.

Atmosphere: Urban loft feel, with an earthy twist - wooden cabinets here and there with shop made preserves - the same they use in the menus, metal shelving by the kitchen with more preserves. 

An earth wind and fire vibe - the fire being the staff. LOL - the wait staff delivering \"table side romance\" expertly (as Chef David Adjey puts it) - aka - explaining the dishes in all their fabulous-ness, which they obviously enjoyed their tasting prior to service, and it showed.

Speaking of chefs - Chef Lynn Crawford was there our night (tuesday) in a low-key fashion donning a cuban style military cap, taking care of the front of the house, accepting in guests, brought food to our table, and even set one of our place settings. It shows she loves what she does, and does whatever is needed in the moment. Kudos to you Lynn for being so grounded.

The daily menu was laid out as if it were acts of the play programme that we consulted while consuming - referring to it time and again... and between courses relishing the next \"act\" by reading the synopsis.

Food profile - combinations were outstanding - who could pull off roasted new and sweet potatoes with jalapeno and dill aioli without having one overpower the other.

or, sweet and sour peppers as the accompaniment to charred broccoli ... being normally a lover of broccoli stems alone, when one sears the tops with butter to crispy perfection I'm now a converted soul.

And while not a huge fish fan - the super light flavour of salt baked rainbow trout - well \"lemoned\",  watercress, grilled yellow and green zucchini with buttermilk dressing was hands down fantastic. Nothing outshone the others - as each flavour was perfectly matched in intensity to the other - such as the 4 tenors would be to singing.

Family style serving works perfectly for us, as my companion was gluten free and sans soy - we made our reservations in advance also noting this... as most restaurants would roll their eyes and groan... Ruby Watchco took it in stride, made us feel quite at home, and not an inconvenience by one iota... 

So much so they made a special dessert just for him was better than mine (although mine was excellent!) who could resist a bourbon rhubarb strawberry sauce over a meringue pavlova.  

And were happy to double check there was no soy oil in any of the dressings/sauces etc!

I could go on, but hopefully you're hungry enough to go check it out for yourself by now 
haa haa
you're welcome ;)

PS - oh - and the waiter upon hearing us gush a little about Lynn - we asked if we could keep the daily menu and he came back with a signed copy! Awesome."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A festive yet laidback restaurant with an ever-changing locally-sourced tasting menu at a reasonable cost.  And you get to see Lynn Crawford in action!

Cost:
-$49 for the meal.

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Relaxed, exposed brick with an imposing RUBY WATCHCO industrial sign at the back.
-Seating is tight, but there's a good bar area.

Ordered:
-The menu changes daily, but here's my four-course meal:

1. Spicy asian greens with pickled watermelon and chili shrimp: This was the highlight of the meal with very fresh greens, a subtle cilantro and lime dressing and cruncy shrimp.

2. Drunken chicken braised in beer with sides of spicy chicken wings, garden salad with apple slices, and fingerling potatoes: The beer chicken itself was a bit dry, but the chicken wings were ultra tender and tasty, and the salad and potatoes were delicious.

3. Sweet and sour tomatoes with sides of chedder and zucchini bread: The tomatoes were really quite something with it being pickled and infused with honey.

4. White chocolate lemon mousse: My stomach was about to rupture at this point, but this really hit the spot!

Service:
-Our server was cheerful, attentive, and made good wine recommendations.
-The staff as a crew seemed bustling and happy, and I had a great view of their open kitchen from my table.

Conclusion:
-If you're not a picky eater and you like surprises (of you like having meal decisions made for you), then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"The best food we had in Toronto and the friendliest. Super great staff and delicious food.
We had the Thanksgiving dinner. It started with the chefs take on the Shrimp Cocktail. It was a luscious Shrimp Cocktail Salad. I love that it's family style. 
The entree was a Poached Turkey Breast with Confit Gravy, so moist and delicious! Served with ALL the fixings. Next course was some amazing cheese and ended with Pumpkin Cheesecake. It was a perfect leisurely delicious Thanksgiving meal indeed. Thanks Ruby Watchco!"}
{"text":"Lucky me, I was treated to a fabulous birthday dinner here this year! After years of disappointing \"I want to celebrate aging by eating lots of really good food\" meals, I was so pleased with my experience at Ruby Watchco. 

First of all, Ruby Watchco is one of those places that isn't well-suited to extremely picky eaters. With a set menu that changes daily, it's a bit of a gamble if you'll like what they're servin' up on any given evening. Admittedly the meal I had wasn't the BEST I'd ever eaten or even what I would have ordered for myself, but that's part of the novelty of dining there -- it encourages you to expand your horizons, and to let yourself be surprised. 

Anyway, on the night I went they were serving a delicious bean salad to start, duck as the main, Grey Owl cheese with onion jam, and a vanilla rice pudding for dessert. There's one review below that states that there are no vegetarian alternatives, which couldn't be further from the truth! They are VERY accommodating for vegetarians, creating separate meat-free versions of ANY item that includes meat -- just let them know when you make your reservation. My veg main course was some sort of roasted squash with caponata; lots of bold flavours accompanied by a variety of sides including parsnips in cream sauce, fingerling potatoes, and red cabbage. Servings are incredibly generous and for $49 per person, comes at a great value. Washed down with a seasonal cocktail (3 G's is delicious, by the way) followed by a glass of Pinot Gris, I stumbled out of Ruby Watcho very glad to have turned a year older.  

Service was also very good, and it's evident that most of the servers have lots of experience and love doing what they do. Note that service is definitely more on the \"leisurely\" end, which fits with the family-style dining theme. Overall, the entire meal lasted about two hours or so, so be sure to allot enough time and don't come here in a rush -- it spoils the experience!

Even though my meal wasn't necessarily extraordinary (personal preference!), I would definitely come back to try another menu and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place and at the end we were all quite disappointed. 
First of all it is a fixed menu and the main course was steak. They don't even ask you how you want to steak cooked. It's medium for everyone! No steak knife! And we had a vegetarian person in our group that didn't eat the main course!
The other problem was that they charged a set price per person but they bring \"family style\". We got 2 small dished of salad for 6 people and table of 2 would receive the size of plate.
The 3rd course was just a piece of cheese! And the last course was an average panacotta. 
They charged us $6 for tap water as well. At the end our bill without alcohol came to $72 per person which is a lot compare to the food that you get and the cost for restaurant to serve one dish for everyone should be a lot less!
I would not go back."}
{"text":"Went there as part of a group that reserved upstairs and had a fixed menu.

The upstairs area was great for our group, and the service was quite good, but I had some issues with the main course.  The beef was a bit chewy, one of the side dishes was hot but the rest were barely luke-warm, and worst of all was the sweetness - I think they must have added a bunch of sugar."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant!  I was hoping to see Chef Lynn Crawford there for Friday dinner service but alas it was not meant to be. I'm sure she doesn't spend as much time in the kitchen anymore. 
We arrived for our 8:30 dinner reservation early and were greeted with a warm, \"no problem.\"  Then seated immediately right beside the kitchen so we could watch all the action. 
They have a set menu that changes daily. It ensures you are being served the freshest and most seasonal ingredients. I love the idea, but I can see how some might think that restrictive. So, if you are a picky eater and want a diverse choice when choosing your meal, this may not be the place for you. 
The menu that night started with a beef carpaccio salad with pickled beets a lemon vinaigrette. It was very fresh with nice flavourful heirloom tomatoes and a touch of spice with a couple pickled jalapeÃ±o peppers. It was a nice light start to the meal. 
Next was the main course of pan seared salmon accompanied by roasted squash with chunks of salty beautiful bacon. Grilled broccoli with lemon butter and black kale with lentils. The salmon was perfectly cooked with a deliciously crisp skin and served on a bed of smoked salmon chowder. The highlight for me besides the perfect salmon was the squash with bacon. It was so good. 
The next course, cheese was a nice Brie. Very buttery and runny. I wish the piece was a little bigger but that would be my only complaint. It was served with a nut brittle (cant remember what kind), and a nice drizzle of a smoke infused honey that was so different but amazing. Never thought smoke and honey would work so well. 
The final course. Desert was a ramekin of pear and apple crisp with a dollop of ice cream. It was a little too sweet for me. I'm usually not one to complain about sweetness but something was too much for me on this dish. Maybe it was the caramel drizzle on top. 
All and all a solid meal. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection. The staff were great!  Very attentive and explained every course as it was delivered to our awaiting appetites. I would say the meal was transcendent but it was just comforting food served perfectly and with an attention to every detail. My wife and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We went here for their Valentine's dinner. It's a great spot for a date night as it's very dark, trendy and the food is great. One oddity is that they give you one large dish for two people for each dish type( app, main, dessert) which I've never seen before except in Asian restaurants but I definitely didn't mind. The service was decent though.

The food itself was excellent. Some of the best I've had anywhere. The heirloom carrot salad was a great mix of flavours and made for a decent salad. The hanger steak was amazing. Perfectly rare, delicious meat. Everything on that plate was amazing actually. The broccoli, the parnsips and even the potatoes. The dessert, chocolate lover's delight, was sooo good and I usually don't have much of a sweet tooth. The one dish that I didn't like (actually it made me gag) was the St Honore by Fromagerie Alexis De Portneuf. It was just a really bad mix of sweet, sour, and nauseating texture whereas all the other dishes were a great mix of interesting and unique flavours. Aside from that mistake of a dish, the meal was one of the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. After reading raves on Yelp, I knew I had to check this out this Leslieville spot. Ruby Watchco is a table d'hÃ´te helmed by pre-eminent Toronto chef Lynn Crawford, whom you might know from Restaurant Makeover. But instead of tweaking other menus at RW she in full control of her own; turning out magical fixed courses on the daily.

We showed up minutes before closing and managed to sneak a spot on the bar. This was a superior spot to sit and I would even recommend it over a table. With her close proximity, our delightful server was constantly dropping useful and interesting notes throughout the evening. The decor is simple but sparkling at RW and the 12-foot mirrored sign reading Ruby Watchco was apparently the inspiration for this resto's name.

Dinner was fantastic. Starting off with their butter and biscuits, I could swear they churned their own. We moved on to broccoli and heirloom carrots, potatoes scalloped in gouda cheese, a whole damn chicken, a cheese and crostini plate -- this felt like enough food for a family of four. All of it was plated with care and utterly delicious.

As we pigged out family style under the subdued lights and amidst the din of contented diners, the realization came upon me that I don't think I have ever eaten so well in Toronto. Go now.

Obligatory Title Pun: You better WATCH out, Leslieville.

Menu Readability: A beautifully laid out one-sheet detailing what you will be enjoying that evening.

Need to mention: If you like Bloody Caesars, you will greatly enjoy their clamato with horse-radish-infused vodka. You heard me.

What this place teaches me about myself: Perfect for the decision-hater inside you."}
{"text":"The food was good, I wasn't blown away by anything. Which is fine since they only offer a pre-fixe menu so they cant get too adventurous or else not everyone would enjoy it. The staff were all very nice, and accommodating. They were also well informed on the wine and food pairing. 

I'm not sure if it was the top 40's music or the food but I left feeling like something was missing. There wasn't any atmosphere or vibe, it felt like it could have been a chain restaurant which is not what I want when spending over $100 per person. I could see myself going back, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"A $49 family style prix fixe. You can also get wine pairings for $39.

The servers are great - really friendly and attentive.

-We started with the chopped salad. The beets were the star of the dish.
-Our main was barbeque chicken and sausage. Not super amazing, overall very tasty.
-There's a cheese course that includes pretty large servings of cheese.
-Dessert was a rice pudding. It wasn't overly sweet, but I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding.

I didn't love the menu we had, but I loved the experience and would definitely come back since the menu changes regularly."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences of my life.  Chef Lynn should be proud of her restaurant and for good reason...this restaurant is awesome.  They have a unique style of a daily fixed 4 course menu with optional additions and wine pairings.  The dÃ©cor is trendy, comfortable and Canadian sophisticated.  The food was delicious, family style portions and well balanced.  I did the wine pairing with my meal and it was a perfect addition to each course.  The room can get noisy and expect a couple of hours to complete your meal.  On bust nights a reservation is recommended.  The menu is pricy but for the quality of service and meal it feel it is worth it especially for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary.  Try Ruby Watchco, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm coming to this place after reservation was full at the Thai restaurant, unsure about how long I have to wait, but we walk in anyways. The staffs are friendly and they were able to accommodate us. The course for today is a mushroom salad, halibut, beef cheek is optional, but I add it in, because I'm a pig; cheese plate and dessert. It was amazing, I hate veggies even my mom told me it was good for me. My favorite turns out  to be the wild mushroom salad, the beef cheek was soft tender, melt in my mouth, it was like an orgasmic experience inside my mouth. They aren't conservative in feeding you, the dish are big and plenty. We were stuff after entree. But the food is so good that I kept on eating forgetting I'm full. Environment is vibrant, family friendly. I'm coming back next time with my family and friends."}
{"text":"Last visited in 2015 on a visit to Toronto. Returned because I was so impressed during my last visit. The food on this visit was just as good. However, the timing of the meal service was far slower. Last time, I was in the first seating. This time, we were on the second seating. Bottom line, I'll definitely be back, but I'll go for the first seating.

The menu changes every day. Vegetarians should note their requirements in the reservation. A seafood option is available on meat nights."}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant on a friend's recommendation . Interesting atmosphere. They change their menu daily. One prix fix menu with salad, entree,  cheese and dessert for about $54 dollars. Also offer wine pairing. I opted to have wine a la carter with salad and main but not dessert. 

Started with delicious salad of greens and pecan. We had a table of 6 and there were 2 big plates to share. Everything came in dishes to share. Main course was a spicy pretzel coated trout. With mushroom risotto, carrots and kale with Apple as sides. Everything was delicious. One of my friends did not like fish so he got the chicken instead but we all shared the sides. We also had aged cheddar with endive and pear. The dessert was spice/cinnamon cake.  We ordered the bone marrow supplement to share. It was like butter on bread. Tasty. 

All in all very good meal. Will go back to try another prix fix. Bonus points: Waiter was willing to calculate for us to split the bill (because some had wine pairing,  some didn't drink at all)"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. Like some of the other reviewers I did find it a bit loud. I am a picky eater and they were able to accommodate some of the items I was not keen on, so that made me happy. Overall it was a great experience with friendly knowledgeable servers. Good food with nice presentation. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We had my husbands surprise 40th birthday party in the private party room. The communication prior to the party with Mary was great, she was patient and responsive with all my questions.

The room is beautiful and perfect for the size of our party. There were several kids and they had space to run around. It was a little warm which was fixed by opening the windows, although this resulted in a draft for those sitting on that side of the table.

Our server was great and described all the food to the guests as they were served. He was also kept everyone's water and drinks topped up. There were long gaps between the courses which made the kids very impatient although I think this was due to the kitchen not our server.

The canapÃ©s were amazing, and all the guests raved about them. The beet salad was also good although a little salty. I was disappointed with the main course which was quite bland. The leftover sweet potato was delicious when I ate it at home after seasoning it. Also the lentil dish with spinach and mushrooms barely had any of the last two ingredients, and also quite bland.

Dessert was carrot cake which was yum, albeit a little sweeter than my taste. 

Overall everyone had fun, but I wish the food had been better."}
