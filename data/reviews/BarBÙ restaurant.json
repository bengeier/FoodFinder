{"text":"Went to BarBÙ without expecting anything. The decor is really nice and had a nice ambiance. The food menu is pretty large going from burgers to Tartare.   I ordered the rack of ribs. The ribs were a bit dry and had no sauce on it. I had to ask a waitress to bring be a little cup of sauce on the side. There was also a lack on seasoning.   I also order a drink, that was bitter in a wrong way. Not sure if it was meant to be that way or just the under trained bar staff missing part of the recipe.   Overall the amount of food in the plate is worth it, but the lack of seasoning of the food made me experience exactly like my drink, bitter."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure where to go with my outta town friend. Decided to turn of and saw this place. Loved the atmosphere! This resto pub has a great selection of food & drinks. I had the Casolette of Louisiana shrimp, it was ok, lacked a little flavor, more salt maybe? This was a 12 dollar appetizer, the plate looked pretty but I think totally over priced. It had 5 shrimp on it and a few tastless veggies. Wouldn't recommend it. My Besty had the BARBU burger, which cost the same but was a much better deal! The burger was juicy & big. Fries crispy & salad tasty.   There were a couple of things on the menu I'd want to go back to try, like the poutine with duck & lamb gravy. The place is a really hip place with a sweet terrace in the back. The service was great and though my food was lack luster, I do look forward to them proving me wrong:)"}
{"text":"Excellent resto bistro chic. Je ne suis pas un grand fan de hamburger mais c'est certainement un des meilleurs hamburger que j'ai mangé (burger au pulled porc et buf). Tartare de saumon très frais et parfaitement assaisonné. J'y retourne c'est certain."}
{"text":"2ème arrêt au Barbù et nous avons vécu une petite déception! Les entrées étaient plutôt réussies: le duo de crab cake était savoureux et goûtait vraiment le crabe (un critère rarement respecté au resto!), alors que le chèvre chaud était goûteux mais était beaucoup trop sucré à mon avis (pomme cuite + BEAUCOUP de miel + caramel balsamique = trop!). C'est davantage au plat principal que notre expérience nous a déçus. Le duo de tartare (saumon et boeuf) manquait de saveur. Le tartare de boeuf n'était pas relevé, le tartare de saumon était insipide. La salade d'accompagnement baignait encore une fois dans sa vinaigrette, ce qui la rend impossible à manger et les frites sont très ordinaires (ne goûtent que le gras, texture sèche). Pour sa part, le ravioli de cerf aux champignons et à l'huile de truffe était beaucoup trop concentré en saveur. J'essayais d'enlever la sauce de mes pâtes avant de prendre une bouchée, ce n'est pas peu dire. Point fort de la soirée? Le long island iced tea: cocktail parfaitement bien exécuté! Goût de lime bien présent, goût punché, dangereusement bon! On y retourne pour la super terrasse et l'ambiance, et pour essayer leurs plats de style bistro!"}
{"text":"Premièrement, il ne faut pas s'asseoir au bar parce qu'on nous ignore chaque fois qu'il y a \"un habitué\" assis là. Ça nous est arrivé à quelques reprises d'avoir un service médiocre à cause de ça, c'est frustrant. Aux tables, le service est beaucoup mieux, mais c'est souvent très long. Bouffe correct mais pas beaucoup d'options végés. Les Bloody Caesar sont excellents. Bonne ambiance."}
{"text":"When it comes to Quebec restaurants, I really tend to stick to Montreal proper. This is mostly due to my living downtown and the abundant options all around me that don't involve me crossing a bridge. Now, as someone who grew up off-island, I am very familiar and used to the idea of crossing our \"beloved\" bridges to get to places - restaurants for the most part don't happen to be one of those \"worthwhile' reasons anymore.  Recently I had an event on the South Shore which brought me to a restaurant in Boucherville which I had never heard of before - Le BarBÙ. The restaurant is located in a strip mall just off the highway in Boucherville. It doesn't make much of a first impression that way but that changes once inside. A nice modern decor punctuated with faux stone walls and art prints, it also has an exposed wine cellar and a nice bar area with a unique apparatus where the bottles hang from the ceiling. The restaurant clearly aims for the 5-7 crowd as well as dining. So the setting is nice but for me, the food is the most important. For this particular dinner I was apart of, it was a table d'hôte composed of regular items for the menu so my choices were limited somewhat.  First up, a combination of soup and salad. The soup was a rice and vegetable soup and the salad was a standard chef's salad. Both were solid but unspectacular - the soup had the right consistency and was not stingy on the rice or vegetables. The chef's salad was exactly what you have expected from a chef's salad - a good mix of lettuce and fresh vegetables which thankfully was not completely covered in a thick ranch dressing. On their regular menu, there were definitely more interesting options for starters but my hands were tied sadly.  I got to try two different mains - the first was an Angus beef skirt steak with shallot sauce, vegetables and house fries. A pretty classic French bistro dish and well executed throughout. The steak was cooked properly with a nice sear on the outside and the shallot based sauce added some nice flavour. The house fries were thankfully cooked well - crispy on the outside but still soft enough on the inside. The cut of the fries was also perfect for me - not quite matchstick but not the thick wedges either. Overall a solid dish.  The second main I got to try was butternut squash ravioli with goat cheese and a Portneuf sauce. Compared to the previous main dish, this was a much more creative endeavour. Loved the combination of the squash with the richness of the goat cheese. The Porfneuf sauce added nice creaminess to the mix - this was definitely not a light pasta dish. Very well done overall.  Finally, for dessert, we got a piece of chocolate cake. A chocolate mousse on top of a chocolate cookie layer topped with a chocolate ganache. If you don't like chocolate, this probably isn't for you but for the rest of us, this works rather well.  Le BarBÙ turned out to be a pleasantly solid surprise for me. I had no expectations going in but the food was solid, the wine list was interesting and the cocktails were well done. South Shore dining is not a regular thing for me but le BarBÙ definitely becomes a place to revisit. I'm still not prepared to cross a bridge to the South Shore too often for a meal but this is a good start to get me thinking about it.  Cheers!"}
