{"text":"One of the best dining experiences that I've had in Pittsburgh in a while!
The decor is so welcoming with the open kitchen and friendly staff that you feel as if you are at a large family dinner.  (Only you are treated to a gastronomical delight that only DeShantz and staff can offer)
The french onion soup alone was enough to get me back!  
Each dish was unique and took us on a tour of everything delicious a bistro can offer.
The skate wing melts in your mouth, oysters Rockefeller was fantastic, and everything else was a treat including the lobster pasta, escargot, steak tartare, and roast chicken. 
Save room for dessert because the beignets are so good that if you order too much, like my group, you'll wish you could eat more than just one. 
On top of everything, the wine list and cocktails are all expertly put together and very approachable.  The staff was knowledgeable and guided us through everything to make us feel comfortable with every decision.  
My only complaint is that I didn't have room to try the mussels or the chip and dip (which come covered in caviar!) but I guess there's always next time."}
{"text":"Lawrenceville has another winner. Best French Onion Soup in the area and a wonderful redecoration of the Tamari location. Don't forget dessert."}
{"text":"This is literally the best French restaurant I have ever been at, with the exception of Paris! The French onion soup was the best I have ever had in my life! Plus it was so authentic! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My word, this place is as good as it gets in the city. I stopped in here for dinner one night a week or so ago, and let me just say, the dining experience was positively incredible. I anticipated a very filling and rich dinner that night, so I will say this can't be a weekly thing for me based on the price, but my goodness, what a treat for the occasional Epicurean adventure.

I must say that night, I had my fill. I had the wonderful cheese plate to start things off, which was a delight, and it was my pleasure to partake in an amazing Mushroom Vol-Au-Vent, which featured a delightfully flaky puff pastry and the inspired addition of fried walnuts, which I will say, I'd never thought would've gone with mushrooms, but it worked.

For my main course, I chose the bistro burger, medium. I do not like cornichons, so I confess I had to make a substitution there, but otherwise, it was delightful and juicy. A well cooked burger, to be sure.

Finally, for dessert, I had to try the profiteroles, which one can get at several bakeries around the city, so I had some high expectations here. I can't say it was super spectacular in comparison to those you can get at your local bakery, but for a refreshing dessert to finish off a night a fine dining, they were positively on point. I would recommend this dining experience to anyone on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Well put together restaurant with great food and staff. Will be even better when they open the upstairs. Will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"From start to finish, this was an excellent experience.  From the seating at the Chef's table, to the service, to the food and drinks - every thing was top notch!  The party I was with sampled a variety of items - Onion Soup, Patè, Pomme Frites, Mussels, Trout Almondine and the Soufflè.  Oh my heavens, the SOUFFLÈ!

Not much more to say, just go!"}
{"text":"Poulet Bleu is everything you want in a dining experience. Another reviewer used the term \"flawless\" and I completely agree. From the staff to the food to the décor, it was a seamless Parisian evening.

Our waiter was not ask quick as I, a hasty American, have come to expect when dining out. And I can't say enough about how much I appreciated that. It made me want to sit back, relax, and enjoy the evening with my friend sitting across from me.

LIFE HACK: Order the chocolate soufflé with your initial drink order or appetizer. You're welcome. Also, their version of an Old Fashioned puts all other Old Fashioneds to shame. Easily one of the smoothest cocktails I've ever had.

For entrees, my friend ordered the gnocchi. I only snagged a bite, but that bite was decadent. The texture of gnocchi can vary so greatly from restaurant to restaurant. If there was an alpha male of gnocchi texture, this was it. I went with the Pot-au-feu, which officially taught me to not fear sweetbreads. While it was certainly a heavy dish, the combination of textures and flavors in the pot (the crunch of the fried sweetbreads against the tender veal, the grill marks on the cabbage, the gooey potatoes and cheese) came together in a way that was so dazzling I don't actually think the calories counted.

In short, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:30 on opening evening, and in classic DeShantz/Sevdik style, the staff and kitchen performed like they have been in business, at that location, for years. The décor is simply breathtaking, you walk in, and you feel as if you are in a Normandy French Chateau. The Drink/Wine/Champagne selections were exquisite and creative, and the bar staff was extremely knowledgeable and courteous.  Although the drinks, design and service are impeccable, the cuisine is what the masses of yinzers yearn for, and they will not be disappointed! The Fois Gras was prepared perfectly, with just a light sear on each side served with poached pear, giving that classic sweet/savory combination explosion with every bite. The complimentary Asparagus from Chef DeShantz was one of my favorite plates as well, but the Veal and the Signature Chicken stole the show! Incredibly tasty, superbly seasoned, and perfectly prepared, every thing we tasted was a joy to our palate. We finished the night off with some Crème Brule topped with fresh, ripe berries. All in all, this has taken the reigns as my favorite new restaurant in the city, and I am excited to see what they do with the patio and upstairs in the spring!"}
{"text":"Getting right to it; here are a few tips you might find helpful:

-Make reservations very early in advance (we had to book 1.5 months in advance for a table on a Friday night). 
-Don't come on a record hot summer day (their ac sucks). 
-Order the Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer and Clafoutis for dessert. 
-Get the Gimlet to drink. 
-Expect to spend $$$ but you might find it worth it!

This restaurant is super cute in terms of atmosphere and they definitely know how to prepare food the right way. My table ordered the French Onion Soup, Oysters Rockefeller, Scallops, Mussels,  Macaroni Au Gratin, NY Strip (we sampled two sauces: bordelaise and house sauce), Beignets, and Clafoutis, in which we split everything. I highly recommend getting items from the Petit Plats and splitting them. 

While everything was good, my favorites were definitely the Oysters Rockefeller and Clafoutis. The steak was good, but probably not worth $42. If you do go that route, the bordelaise sauce is the way to go. Overall, though, good food, good drinks. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely, bright, cheerful etc. and the staff was all incredibly kind and personable. 
The French onion soup and the French fries were great, however the rest of our food was inedible. The bistro burger was terrible and mostly just cheese, and the aligot potatoes were unrecognizable and again just a bowl of melted cheese. Inedible. 
Have heard other things are good, but we were pretty shocked compared to how much we enjoy the food at the other restaurants owned by this group."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular, I ordered the Waygu special with the foie supplement and the béarnaise sauce. The steak was the best I have had in my life, if not the best dish in my life. This is the only place in Pittsburgh that serves true French cuisine at an elevated level. My only gripe was that the frites aren't severed with an aioli, I had to request it. I had a country pate for an appetizer along side warm olives and a locally baked baguette. The atmosphere is spot on with beautiful decor and most seats have a great view of the chefs working the pass. Again the only reason for my four star review, as apposed to the five, was our service. Our server was at our table every 5 minuets. I appreciate attentive service but she asked us if we wanted to order the soufflé four times because it takes 30 minuets to bake. I almost ordered it out of spite..."}
{"text":"Four of us sat in the outside patio area and had French Onion soup, carrots, asparagus, Oysters Rockefeller, olives, cheese plate, wine and bread.  Pretty amazing.  Everything was very well prepared, fresh, tasty and the service was dead on. Reputation is well deserved."}
{"text":"Truthfully the food is five star. But two things made the experience very uncomfortable. The hard wood slat  benches are unbearable. At least put a cushion on it. After a one hour drive to get to the restaurant, sitting two more hours for meal should be pleasant, not painful. Definitely the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever used at a restaurant. Secondly, as others have mentioned, get some air conditioning! That hanging wall unit just isn't enough for summer heat and humidity.

On a brighter note, the onion soup is the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary Friday evening. We had the best waiter! I don't recall his name but he gave us 2 complimentary glasses of bubbly! Fantastic way to start the evening! We had the beef tartar and scallops for appetizers. Both were delicious! I had the French gnocchi. O.M.G.  They were the best gnocchi I have ever tasted! So light and airy. My husband had the strip steak and loved that as well. We had the carrots for a side and those were magnificent! We had the soufflé for dessert. This was the only disappointing part of the meal. It's not very chocolaty or moist so adjust expectations. I'd come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This is bar far the best meal I have had in pittsburgh in a long time. I went to Poulet Bleu last Thursday, March 22nd. It was unreal. Our waiter, Timothy, was great as well. 

The open kitchen is refreshing and fun to see!

We had the chicken liver pate (first time for me having chicken liver) and it was so delicious. The crunch on the sweet and tart Granny Smith Apple with it was perfect. And we also had the chips and dip with caviar - simple but so delicate and tasty!!

As a side we shared the Mushroom VolAu-vent. The fries walnuts added richness and crunch. The mushrooms were rich and earthy. It was spectacular. 

For the main course I went with the Gnocchi. Being Italian you are thinking heavy and red sauce but this was so light. The gnocchi were little pillows that melted in your mouth. The brown butter and roasted tomatoes were the perfect compliment. My coworker had the chef's cut. It was the best steak I have tasted in pittsburgh!  You could cut easily with a fork and the bordelaise sauce was out of this world. 

Lastly, for dessert we had the chocolate soufflé. First time having a soufflé and I loved it. Beautiful presentation with dipping sauces and ice cream!

I cannot wait to go back and try more options!!!!"}
{"text":"Poulet Bleu is an awesome, French bistro dining experience. As soon as my wife and I walked in, we felt like we had entered an escape hatch and landed in Paris. The decor is very much what we encountered in France. The service was great! Damian (pronounced Damon), has been with the DeShantz group for a few years, and he knows the menu.

The food was great! We started with a melted cheese appetizer, and while the cheese was succulent and a little sweet (from locally sourced honey), the bread was the show-stopper. They get their bread from La Gourmandine, a local, authentic French bakery with a couple of locations in the Pittsburgh area.

The French Onion Soup was outstanding. The broth was thick and naturally sweet from the caramelized onions. The oxtail broth was soooo rich, and even had some pieces of slowly braised oxtail meat in the broth. Yummy! Of course, the cheese that topped this masterpiece was funky and sharp. Soooo good!

My wife and I split the steak and frites, choosing the NY Strip. It was perfectly cooked. I would recommend that you get the house sauce, which was so flavorful (don't worry that it has puréed chicken livers in it, the sauce is not the slightest bit livery in texture or flavor--it is a deep, umami bomb!). Our steak was topped with fois gras, which was perfectly seared. If you have never had fois, do yourself a favor and order it (for a mere $13 extra) with your steak. Fois will change your life.

Needless, to say, this place has quickly become our new favorite in Pittsburgh. Richard DeShantz triumphs again. His Beard nomination for the best restaurant group is well deserved."}
{"text":"This is the cutest place I've ever seen. The French onion soup was incredible and so was dessert. The servers were really friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"This definitely just became my favorite French restaurant in town (previously it was The Twisted Frenchman ). 
We started with foie gras and mussels, both incredibly tasty and appetizing. The foie gras was the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the poached apple added a nice layer of acidity and freshness to the richness of the dish. 
For the main course, we had the chef's cut (Australian Wagyu flat iron) and trout. The former was a tad on the rare side (rather than medium rare), which we didn't mind at all! It was tender and absolutely delicious. The house sauce was a little salty and maybe overpowering the protein, so we will try another sauce next time. The trout was nicely cooked with crispy skin outside and tenderness inside. 
We ended the meal with chocolate soufflé for two, and it was gigantic (looks as big as my head in picture)! It came with four different sauces and ice cream; we finished the ice cream before the soufflé and were well accommodated with two additional scoops.  
All in all, it was a wonderful dinner, despite the fact that the girl at the next table was drunk and screaming her heart out (and my head off) the entire time  We will definitely visit again soon!k"}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious. The food was decedent and the service was superb. But, the atmosphere was miserable. It had to be over 90 degrees and rising as we sat and consumed our dinner. Waiting 3 months for a reservation to sit in a sauna was unacceptable. Please get central air!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poulet Bleu is very fun venue.

The wine selection is fantastic. We hit the entire spectrum and liked what we had; red, white, and sparkling. Seeing wines all from France was a nice touch. We enjoyed each wine we had. The bar staff did a good job serving.

The food was very good. The escargot was absolutely fantastic. The serving sizes were well done."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful- very fresh and airy. There is a great outdoor space too for some al fresca dining. 

The service was also fantastic. Very attentive and knowledgeable. 

I had the gimlet cocktail and it was like a glass of fresh lemonade.  The presentation was super cute too- little clothespin holding lavender and a dried line on the rim of the glass- so cute! 

The food was kind of underwhelming, especially given all the press and excitement over this restaurant. The mashed potatoes were basically just melted cheese. You literally had to cut them wth a knife. I love cheesy potatoes, but I'm not sure there were any potatoes in there. The warmed olives were also overcooked to the point where they were soft and mushy; not good. 

On the other hand, dessert was amazing! We got the chocolate soufflé for two. You have to order this when you order your meal because it takes 30 mins to make, but it was worth it! Light, gooey, and the banana ice cream and sauces were amazing. This is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow (now say it like Gordon Ramsay). Fabulous. Everything was exceptional. From our wonderful waiter, to the decor, to the presentation and delicious food. The chocolate soufflé, French onion soups, and lobster spaghetti are musts. My partner and I skipped the big plats and just got some small plats and a side to share. I think 2 small plats, a side, and a dessert is a perfect amount of food. We got 3 small plats, a side, and a dessert and we were stuffed and couldn't finish the soufflé. We were so sad to leave it behind  we'll definitely be returning soon! Great place to go for a special occasion. I'd give ten stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I cannot sing this restaurant's praises enough. My husband and I visited Poulet Bleu on Saturday for dessert and drinks. I was enamored with the place. It feels like you are truly in a little cafe in France. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable about the french wine and cuisine, the service was speedy, and the dessert was to die for. We had wished that we came for dinner, too. No doubt this is one of my new very favorites in Pittsburgh, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Poulet Bleu is a great new establishment, and the highest praise I can heap is that (for once) you don't realize that you're dining at a DeShantz restaurant.  

The food is great, and the selection of small plates and side dishes is really extensive, particularly compared to other French restaurants in town.  I particularly enjoyed the frisee salad with poached egg. 

The shining star of Poulet Bleu is the atmosphere and decor.  It looks fabulous inside and out (we had a lovely night on the patio), and you genuinely could be in the middle of Paris.  The service was also attentive and quite good. 

Some of the prices for dishes seemed high, but that's increasingly the new normal for nicer restaurants in Pittsburgh, and it's not out of line with what you see at any other similar restaurant.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good...not great. My meal was served a bit cold, actually. Others in my party enjoyed their steak. Appetizers....chips and dip with caviar, not worth the price. Oysters Rockefeller. ..nothing special.  I think this place is good...certainly not great. Will I go back...maybe on a weeknight."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. 

If you have a chance, sit at the chef's table and enjoy the artists go to work. Beautiful decor, amazing staff, and amazing food 10/10 experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory dinner with friends! The customer service was fantastic from the start. My friend wanted to bring champagne (they have a $20 corking few). They already had glasses on the table and a champagne chiller ready. The manager made sure that the champagne was chilled to the perfect temperature before serving. We ordered bread and warm olives to start, which were pretty good. For our meals my friends got the steak tar tar and the French onion soup-- they said both were fantastic! I split the gnocchi, Mac n cheese and asparagus (all vegetarian). The gnocchi was amazing- it's fried in butter and filled with gruyere. The Mac n cheese was only okay, after seeing pictures I was super excited but I think it was missing salt and a more dimensional flavor. The asparagus was pretty good it's in a mustard sauce. We ordered the Pavlova for dessert it's really citrusy and berry flavored- highly recommend! They also brought out a free creme brûlée since we were celebrating, which was also delicious. Overall wonderful dining experience especially on the patio."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best restaurants in the city right now. The food was amazing. The service was outstanding. Our server was Michael. He was so attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. It's very charming inside & I actually felt as if I were in a bistro in Paris. It was packed on a Wednesday night. It is the new go to place. They have a bar which will serve a full meal to you. It's first come first serve. They also have seating outside. I can't wait to go back. I would highly recommend it. If you are going to go and say it's expensive, then don't go because it is. But you know the saying..   you get what you pay for in life. C'est la vie!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to celebrate a special birthday, and it lived up to all of the hype!

The service and ambience couldn't have been better, though I'd love to sit outside next time. Inside was lovely, albeit a little hot (there's no central air), but it was so fun to watch the chefs.

We all shared plates, which included the bread cheesy potatoes, burger, steak and gnocchi. All were absolutely incredible, but the souflet at the end stole the show! So make sure to leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing steak and frites and friendly wait staff.  My wife and I sat at the bar seats where you can see the food made.  Wonderfully delicious and worth the price of what you pay.  We would definitely go back.  The online reservation tool said there were no reservations for 2 weeks, but there seemed to be open seats when we showed up."}
{"text":"What an incredible culinary experience. From the Richard DeSchantz Restaurant group, another amazing intelligent concept, this time a French bistro that is definitely to crave any of your sensual indulgences.

The ambience is beyond perfection and creativity from this well thought out and planned restaurant. The French porcelain tile floor to the marble bar tops with elegant Restoration Hardware brass lighting, The ambience sets the tone from the moment you walk in. Fresh cut flowers create the ambience and scent of atmosphere on top of the indulging butter, garlic and savory herbs through out the air.

I highly recommend getting several appetizers to try. The beef tartare especially is one of tenderness to appreciate, the mussels, and if you're really daring, the froie gras is impeccable and delicate paired with pears and onion bulbs. 

As a main course we had the skate and wagyu steak. Again more delicacies that fulfill the aroma and palate of the delicate meat sensory. Accompanied by the carrots and potatoes with Guyare cheese was so amazing, that you didn't want to stop eating it. 

Be prepared to get reservations as this will most likely become a sought after restaurant destination not only for those in Pittsburgh but those traveling and tourism through our neighborhoods.

There is an incredible cocktail list created by no other than Cecil Usher from Meat and Potatoes and an incredible sommelier providing an extensive French wine list.

Enjoy and indulge."}
{"text":"Exceptional--does not disappoint. The decor, service and cuisine offer quite the experience. I highly recommend the soufflé for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner, one of my better meals in recent memory. Feels like a bistro in France in ambiance, service, and food. Every dish, from the cheese plate to the burger to the french onion soup was excellent. The attention to service and detail is apparent. I will certainly come back."}
{"text":"I truly can not say enough amazing things about my dining experience. Toga, you have yet again hit another home run with this amazing addition to your ever expanding restaurant group. The food was truly some of best I ever had here in Pittsburgh.  My waiter Damian  was spot on with every suggestion and allowed our meal to run flawlessly!"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. It is pretty expensive but nice for a special occasion. The service was very attentive, but the waiter was slightly condescending when we asked questions about the menu and were ordering. 

In terms of the food, to start we shared the frisee salad, which is the only thing I wouldn't get again. The bacon was extremely chewy. 

For our mains we shared the aligot potatoes, the french onion soup, and the gnocchi. All were phenomenal. The gnocchi was airy. The potatoes were salty and smooth. The soup was rich and can definitely be eaten as a main dish. 

We finished with the souffle which was incredible. It was served with a range of sauces and banana ice cream. We had to order the souffle at the beggining of our meal, without having seen the rest of the desert menu, so I suggest they show the desert menu with the main so customers can see other options/prices before making a decision on the souffle.

Our wine was also great, but we aren't super picky about wine!"}
{"text":"Removing a star for atmosphere. You guys HAVE to do something about the lack of A/C. Our second visit was good but we literally had sweat pouring down our faces. Also, seated at the banquette - wishing desperately for a pillow - and the chair was teeny, my husband was also uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We popped in on Saturday after a beautiful stroll through Lawrenceville.  While there were no tables available, there were seats at the bar and they were happy to seat and serve us.  We decided to do a wide variety of appetizers and a cocktail and some wine. Our bartender/server was amazing!  She was friendly, knowledgeable, and made you feel so comfortable that you would have thought you were in someone's home.
Our gimlets were amazingly delicious as were the appetizers we ordered along with the cool crisp rose wine we finished with.  We look forward to going back so we can sit on their patio and enjoy some silent movies this summer (we were told that they would be doing this in the summer).  Another spectacular restaurant from Deshantz.  He completely nailed it with the decor, music, food and overall theme!  We literally felt like we were back in Paris at a beautiful little bistro!"}
{"text":"A romantic evening for my boyfriend and I, Poulet Bleu was worth the month-long reservation wait."}
{"text":"My stomach is an empty pit this morning because I completely gorged myself last night at Poulet Bleu! I made reservations a month ago (that's how long the wait was) with two of my girlfriends and was dying from anticipation for the day to arrive! The restaurant is gorgeous inside and gives DiAnoia's some competition when it comes to beautiful interiors! 

First things first....we over ordered...to the max. It wasn't a blind decision but our eyes grew 5 sizes over our stomachs! I personally ordered the tartare, gnocchi and macaroni. I will say that I wanted the carrots over the mac but we were sharing everything and the group won out. The tartare was amazing as expected. I also really enjoyed the gnocchi. The macaroni au gratin was good but I wouldn't suggest ordering my combination of foods because it got pretty rich, pretty quickly. 

Though I loved what I ordered my favorite dishes were ordered by my friend. She ordered the frisee salad, mushroom vol-au-vent  and the filet. Though we were sharing, I was very sad I didn't order the filet on my own because I would have been very selfish and eaten all of it. I have to say that it was the most tender and flavorful steak I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The frisee salad had a perfectly cooked egg with bacon lardon and a really good dressing. The mushroom vol-au-vent was so incredibly addicting! It was my favorite thing I ate. I wish I knew how to make a beautiful bordelaise sauce and would probably marry a man on sight if I knew he could make one! 

On top of our immaculate ordering skills, they also gave us a complimentary side dish, which was the aligot potatoes! I have been really wanting to try them but eat healthy (like a nerd) when I cook at home. I was really excited to give them a taste and they did not disappoint! Who doesn't love potatoes whipped with so much cheese that they almost just become cheese? You also get a toffee with your check and that was delicious too! All across the board, I loved my meal and experience!!!"}
{"text":"Urban Hipster French Bistro? Interesting vibe I guess....does not seem like anyone there really understands true Parisian food.  Way, way, way too salty.  I could not taste anything due to the excessive salt.  Portions are very small....i mean very small.  Menu is limited and not very interesting.  
Local Pittsburgher's  will eat it up though.....service is good and attentive but borderline pretentious which seems to be a common theme around town.  Chairs are very uncomfortable, who designed the long wooden bench with no cushioning at all?  Seriously one of the most uncomfortable seats i have dined in here in town.  Noise level is pretty high, and the location of the bathroom is a bit off putting for me.  I never like when a bathroom door can open visually to where people are eating, it is just a tacky design that could have easily been solved with a simple wall."}
{"text":"First, the good news :  the food is excellent!  The French onion soup and chocolate souffle are very good. Service was good. The bad news :   the air conditioning is nominal and the wooden slatted bench is very uncomfortable to sit on for two hours. Also a waiter dropped a paper menu of drink specials on the floor. He leaned under the table next to us, picked it up and put it ON the table. There were customers sitting at the table!! Nothing in a restaurant should go from the floor TO a table. Yuck. Throw that paper menu away and get a new one. AND the location of the restrooms is less than desirable - opening directly across from the bar right where people walk by to be seated and if the door is left open, you get that view - far from appealing. So even though the food was very tasty, I'm one and done."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Atmosphere was charming, service was on point and friendly with Audrey and food was the best French we've had in Pittsburgh. A few stand outs were the French Onion Soup, Aligot potatoes, trout and soufflé. We've been recommending to all!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. From the Escargot to the steak frites, everything was delicious!!! You actually feel like you're in Europe. (But, really) Definitely try it here! They have seating at the bar if you can't get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Had a great time! Great food, great ambience. One of the employees, Parker (I believe he was a server's assistant?) really was splendid. Great charisma, better customer service! 10/10, you need to try this place."}
{"text":"I was definitely not disappointed at my experience at Poulet Bleu. Honestly, the best dish that I ordered was the steamed carrots if you can believe that or not! I tasted the bistro burger and I was amazing but I ordered the gnocchi. I didn't order dessert because we were so full by the end of the meal but when I return, I am hoping to try the chocolate soufflé. A+++"}
{"text":"Aside from not having many vegetarian entrees, I loved everything about my dining experience here. You could easily make a vegetarian meal out of small plates & appetizers. The one vegetarian entree they have is the most amazing gnocchi dish I have ever had. The gnocchi almost melts away in your mouth, and it's dressed with a delicious sauce and shaved veggies. We ordered a cheese plate to start, and the waitress kindly walked us throufh everything that was served to us. Cocktails were amazing, as expected from a a Dechantz restaurant. My gimlet was reminiscent of spring time, with dried lavender and lime pinned to the side of the glass, but I was more impressed with the flavors of the Ti'punch. If you happen to have dinner here, you MUST get the souffle. It takes 25 minutes to make, so plan ahead in your ordering. The dessert comes with a banana ice cream, which I didn't care for too much. I just dont like the texture of frozen bananas. It's a treat for two, but good luck finishing it after an appetizer and entree. This is a great placr to go on a date, or just have an intimate evening with some close friends. I probably wouldnt bring a large group here, as space is limited. I will definitely be back to try the other veg options that they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic new spot in Pittsburgh. Loved the atmosphere, the service, and especially the food."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a conference, and a friend here took me to this recently opened bistro. It has a smart casual atmosphere, a superlative wine list, and a friendly and knowledgeable staff. And the food was excellent, particularly the veal pot au feu, asparagus, and liver pate. The chef clearly knows his stuff as this place could easily compete in New York."}
{"text":"I visited Poulet Bleu for the 1st time on their first Friday opened.  I was so pleasantly surprised by how flawless everything was run.  I made a reservation via the link on their website; when we arrived a table was waiting for us.
After having just been in Paris last year, I can attest to the fact that this place feels like you've been transported to France the minute you walk in the door (save for everyone speaking French and the whiff of arrogance in the air).  The only thing my husband and I kept saying was that the tables needed to be 50% closer to together to get that real Paris feeling - you need to be sitting on top of each other!  
We had an extremely leisurely dining experience - because, French Cuisine!  We started with two amazing drinks:  The French 75, which was very unique and was the best version of this drink I've ever had, and my husband had the De La Louisiane - which adorably came in a tiny glass with its own \"sidecar\" for refills.
After drinks, we ordered the baguette.  I've been craving European style butter and this did not disappoint.  The baguette was more a sourdough style than a try French baguette, but it was so tasty and really worked well.
For dinner we ordered the Pot au feu and the chef's cut which happened to be wagyu flat iron.  Both were absolutely fantastic.  Do note that the steak sauce comes on top of the steak itself...for some it might be too much, so if you're unsure order it on the side.
For dessert we ordered the soufflé - there were so many toppings and the banana ice cream was out of this world.  It is definitely worth the wait!  We also ordered the french press coffee - my only \"qualm\", which is silly, but my husband and I did wish they had espresso to end the meal.
It was an amazing dining experience from start to finish.  The servers were extremely attentive, but not over bearing, and extremely knowledgable.  We never felt rushed!
Loved it so much that we went back \"just for drinks\" and ended up getting the macaroni and the burger - both were also fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This past week I had the pleasure of dining at Pittsburgh's most exciting new restaurant Poulet Bleu, a charming french bistro. I was lucky to get a random open reservation for 7:45 on a Thursday. This new spot is booked for months out, for many good reasons! 

The location is beautiful inside and out. To start, guests enter through a beautiful open courtyard with french music playing, a fountain, and yellow stripped awnings.

The entrance area features a long bar. I loved the touches of gold and the antiqued mirrors in the bar space. Tip: its first come first serve, you can order a full meal and its empty on Pens game nights. 

The design and decor truly brings this small spot to life. I love the gold light fixtures, blue hues and white marble throughout. The bathroom houses my dream sink + faucet, and there's many beautiful mirrors throughout the space.

We enjoyed a few starters or \"petit plats.\" Including the french onion soup made with braised oxtail, cognac veal stock and emmental, gruyere cheeses. The best part is the floating bread smothered with cheese and crisped flowing over the edges of the bowl. Definitely rich and could be a meal in itself. Also enjoyed the mussels in a creamy sauce with fennel, garlic, white wine and fresh herbs. They were unfortunately served lukewarm. 

For a main dish we shared a 12oz prime NY strip paired with cognanc pepper sauce and pommes frites. Steak and french fries are already a great combination, but at Poulet Bleu this was an extra special treat. I really enjoyed the tender steak and the flavorful red wine caramelized onions it was served with. The super skinny frites were delicious, crispy and salty. 

For dessert we indulged in the already famous chocolate souffle. It's a fun pouf of chocolate served with accompaniments banana ice cream, cherry compote, candied pineapple, chocolate sauce, and a delicious creme anglaise.

I can't wait to return to Poulet Bleu! I've already made a lists of things to try, like the cheese plate and the Parisienne gnocchi."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant with French style cooking. 
Just opened and you may get a few bumps in service but we did not find that. Service was very good.  While the sign says American Bistro it is based on French cooking.  The wine list is very nice with about 25 wines by the glass and about 60 by the bottle; the wines are all French.  The dining area is really nice with a floral wallpaper and a lot of mirrors and an open kitchen that was buzzing.  There is a bar in the front that seats about 12 and a small hightop table. 
To start, I had the Chopped Liver that came on grilled french bread with some apple, cilantro and green onion on top. For the main course, I had the Pot-Au-Feu which is veal breast, veal sweetbreads, potatoes, carrots, cabbage, turnips.   A really delicious meal.  
The desert menu looks interesting but did not have any.  The desert menu includes a soufflé for two that takes awhile to cook but looking forward to trying on our next visit since it has been way to long for a restaurant in the area to do soufflé."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to dine at Poulet Bleu after a month of anticipation. The atmosphere inside is very welcoming and makes you feel like you flew across the pond and walked into a nice and cozy French restaurant. The highlight for me was being able to see into the kitchen and watching the chefs masterfully plate all the dishes. 

I ordered the French Onion Soup as my main dish, it's definitely filling enough to be a standalone entree despite falling under the \"small plates\" section. The soup was some of the best I've ever had, incredibly rich and sweet from the carmelized onions and cheese, and filling enough with the braised oxtail and baguette pieces smothered in cheese. Would definitely come back over and over for this alone. 

For dessert, we ordered the the chocolate souffle and the bignets. The souffle was incredibly light and airy, and the assortment of sauces that come with it are a very nice touch. The banana ice cream that comes with it provides a great temperature contrast to the piping hot souflee as well. The bignets were as light as pillows and the vanilla bean cream that comes with them is delicious as well.

Lastly, the service was absolutely impeccable, our waitress was more than happy to offer us her drink recommendations and was very attentive throughout our dinner - I don't think my water glass was ever more than half empty before being topped up. 

Poulet Bleu is a welcoming addition to Lower Lawrenceville, I definitely plan to bring guests here for any occasion, especially for dessert."}
{"text":"Poulet Bleu which is French for \"blue chicken\" is the latest addition to fine dining in the Lawrenceville area. Sharing the same house number as the soon to be reopened Morcilla, Poulet Bleu is an impeccable establishment that is part of the Richard DeShantz restaurant group. This same group runs Meat and Potatoes downtown along with the dining at the CLO Cabaret where I just was the other night and saw they had changed their menu.

Reservations are strongly recommended because this place fills up fast but if you forget to do so then bar seating is available with the same menu. Dress is business casual. What's neat is they have an open kitchen and depending upon your vantage point you can actually \"see\" them prepare your meal. If you are fortunate to get the \"chef's table\" then the kitchen is right in front of you.

I got there when it opened at 5. I was warmly greeted and they offered to take my coat. The menu is identical to what is online. I was a little disappointed they had removed skate from the menu because I haven't had skate since I was in NY a few years back. I was looking at the French Onion soup which runs $15.00. My waiter explained to me that the soup is a meal in itself since it contains actual oxtail meat in it. The croutons come from La Gourmandine down the street. I ordered that and was debating about getting the burger and fries to go with it.

I got the soup and believe me it was very filling. He was right! This was one of the best French Onion soups I ever had!  I was debating afterwards whether to go with the hamburger which I actually learned comes with two patties and fries or try out tonight's rabbit special. Since I wanted dessert I opted instead for the roasted carrots. That comes with fromage blanc, toasted hazelnuts, brown butter, and dill. As I was ordering that my waiter asked me if I wanted the chocolate souffle for dessert since it takes 30 minutes to prepare and he could get that started for me while I was waiting for my carrots.

The souffle is made for two people and I was disappointed that I couldn't just eat half and take the rest home with me since it wouldn't keep. I suggested that they consider making that dessert into a single portion and he said he would pass along the word. Meantime, I got my carrots and they were melt in your mouth good! I wasn't overly impressed with the fromage blanc but by the time I was through with the carrots I really didn't think I could handle dessert!

I decided to try something anyway. I passed on my usual cream brulee so that I could try something different. I ordered the clafloutis which is blackberry custard, whipped creme fraiche, and lime. This thing was so big I was amazed at the fact I could even finish it. Believe me it did not disappoint! It was one of my waiter's recommendations. 

They play French music in the background to help promote the feel of being in a French restaurant. I was chatting with folks at a nearby table as I ate and learned how much they enjoyed the beef tartare and tossed salad.

Your check comes with a wrapped caramel and although I noticed I was slightly overcharged on my bill, my waiter was quick to remedy that. This place is fairly pricey and parking on Butler St is limited since they are converting one of the pay lots that used to be here.  They have an extensive wine list along with pairing for various meals and desserts. They also serve cocktails as well as fine wines and champagnes straight from the bottle. I would definitely recommend coming here for that special occasion in your life."}
{"text":"Incredible experience on Valentine's Day.  The French onion soup may be the best thing I've tasted in the city.  Skate wing and filet both solid.  Frites were outstanding and the soufflé was a quite a treat.  Impeccable service as well.  Fun to see a few famous athletes too..."}
{"text":"The food was so thoughtfully designed and prepared- exquisite balance of flavors, textures and experiences! I was transplanted to a beautiful French village for the evening! The staff were incredibly attentive and professional! Truly a treat!!!!! Hope you can get in!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Friday evening.  Everything was fantastic!  Our server was also super friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  The decor and ambiance are perfection.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Just wow. I honestly don't know if the DeShantz group can do any wrong. Again, this place just blew me away. I definitely think it is a combo of their stellar eye for design, service and more importantly, hiring incredibly talented chefs, which you have in Chef Dave. 

I have rare times were I'm craving a steak, but the filet just called to me. Good thing it did, because that delectable medium rare cut, along with a superb bordelaise sauce, was good to every last bite. And the French Onion Soup... JUST GET IT. Don't question. Just get! I could eat that every day, it was so flavorful. Also, the Aligot Potatoes. Just get it. 

The frites were good and plentiful, but I think it needed a tad more salt, and I'm not a salt fan either. Just a little more. The asparagus side had a super tasty lemon sauce. It's just that so many other things were so so good, this was afterthought good. And honestly, I just felt like I needed a veggie with all the starch we were consuming! 

I can't wait to go back and enjoy a cocktail or four. The french 75 was probably one of the best I've had, as it was mixed to perfection and was super refreshing. I imagine myself sitting on their patio sipping one often!"}
{"text":"This is an easy five stars. 

After reading a review of Poulet Bleu in a Pittsburgh food blog, I knew that we had to check it out! Making a reservation online was easy, though if you want to sit at the bar, call in and make the request. 

The service here equals any that I've had at any of Pittsburgh's nicest restaurants. Better than at Altius. Better than at Eleven. On par with the Twisted Frenchman.  We were well cared for even though it was dinner rush on Friday night.

We loved our food. We started with the baguette and the garlic white wine mussels. Honesty, ordering the baguette was a bit excessive, but I couldn't help myself--surely judging a French restaurant should include a judgement of the baguette, non?  Both were excellent.  

Our entrees were great, but the real star of the night was the chocolate soufflé. Normally for dessert at home, I'd have a small scoop of ice cream. This colossal confection was served with not only two generous scoops of banana ice cream but dipping sauces and toppings galore! We were stuffed by the time we finished, but it was worth every glorious calorie. 

In summary: when my girlfriend got an award and asked me where she'd could treat me with the cash, Poulet Bleu was the only place that came to mind!"}
{"text":"Great dinner at an excellent new addition to Pittsburgh dining.  We had escargot, onion soup, trout almondine, pot-au-feu, pommes frites, and the not to be missed chocolate soufflé.  Super bar and wine and spirits.
Beautiful setting with true bistro ambiance.  Excellent service.  
Can't wait for warm weather to try the patio."}
{"text":"Very good food. Atmosphere is attractive and light. 

The chocolate soufflé was VERY tasty!"}
{"text":"This beautiful restaurant certainly is worth checking out.  From the very attentive and welcoming staff to the perfectly prepared lobster pasta and filet I was pleased with every detail at this fine bistro.  The French bread is really some of the best I've ever enjoyed and the salad was just right. We were thoughtful to save room for desert as well. I will return soon to try some other offerings."}
