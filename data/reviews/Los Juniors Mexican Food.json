{"text":"This place is the worst place to order from. They will take your money send you the wrong food and tell you oh well the food is no good to me and good to you. If I didn't just have surgery I would've been in there to give them a piece of my mind. NOBODY should order from this place."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars, however it always takes at least 20+ minutes to get our food. We just learned to call ahead to avoid this. Other than that the food is very affordable and DELICIOUS! We come here quite often when we are feeling down for some authentic food. Who knew there was a gem hidden in the local gas station?"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food stuffed into the corner of a gas station. I've had the cheeseburger and Sonoran Hot Dog, both were good. The only thing holding back 5 stars was that the hot dog used a regular bun rather than a bolillo.

Edit: I think they changed the name to Los Patos. Food is still good."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Now called Los Juniors (not Senor Taco). Chorizo breakfast burrito is excellent for $4.50.  The chorizo had an excellent smokey flavor.  \"Los Juniors\" burrito for $6 isn't as good (beans, potatoes, ham, bacon, cheese) - flavors meld together.  

Green sauce - good.

Red sauce - not good. Tomato sauce out of a can. 

Wish the menu had descriptions of all the different burritos so you didn't have to ask. 

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered the kids menu... Bean burrito, french fries and a churro!! $2.99!!!!
We expected the bean and cheese burrito to be small! It was really big:)
Husband ordered an egg burrito... More tortilla than egg but still good. I ordered the arizona burrito which was sooooo big. It was really yummy too. It could have used a little salt and potatoes were a little undercooked. Got a egg, bacon and potato burrito to go. Haven't tried it yet. We will be back though. It was $18 for 4 of us. We just got .99 drinks from the Gas station that this reataurant is attached to."}
{"text":"So good! The burrito prices are too high for a hole in the wall taco shop but the tacos are phenomenal! The carne asada and al pastor are always perfect. On some evenings they have a stand outside the shop and sell tacos. Quick and delicious! Service is good but some people at the gas station can be a lil shady"}
{"text":"Under new management. I ordered beef tacos. Delicious. Would definitely come back. Low price, fast service, great customer service, great food."}
