{"text":"As you can see from my tagline, I don't give out 5 stars very often.  However, Vue deserves it.  I travel to Ohio a couple times a year and had just about given up on having a decent meal and convinced myself to succumb to national chains like TGI Fridays and Chili's.  However, being in the area for a meeting, a friend recommended this place.

The wait staff is timely and courteous.  They do their job well.
The food is excellent.  At a place like this, one would expect small portions, but they were quite large and satisfying.

My wife and I had the avocado and frizzee salads.  Both were delicious.  I had one of the specials of the day (ribeye), and she had the scallops.  Again, both were excellent.

We shared the peach upside down cake for dessert which was consumed in about 30 seconds after it hit the table.  

Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My parents took us out for my belated birthday dinner at Vue.  We'd been a couple years ago and the food and service was excellent, but apparently, since then, ownership has changed hands.  We sat down and waited upwards of 20 minutes to order from the time we received our menus.  Our waiter seemed to ignore us or have better things to do in the back.  On the plus side, the bottle of wine we had (Pinot Noir from Willamette Valley in Oregon) was fantastic.  Sipped that for a while until we got our first course, a lukewarm Kobe Beef Shortrib on top of garlic/horseradish mashed potatoes.  Sent it back due to temperature, and received a new one. On the plus side, it wasnt the same one that they'd just toss in the microwave.  But to serve something thats been sitting around for a while puts a bad taste in my mouth.  

And now wait 20 minutes.

Onto salads.  The salads there sound appetizing, but what you really get is a lot of lettuce and a minor sprinkle of the goods you really want.  The beet salad had 2 meager slices of beet.  The manchego and mixed berry salad had 2 dime sized chunks of manchego and some berries.  We requested some extra manchego on the side.  They did provide.

Back to a good 15-20 minute wait.  

The main courses were actually pretty good.  I got a nice piece of halibut with lump crab (not enough crab in my book, but tasty), rest of the family ordered seabass with a good gnocchi, and a steak.  No real complaints there.  

Dessert was cake that my mother brought.  The cake was fantastic.  But after they brought it out, we waited 5 minutes for the waiter to bring us a knife to cut the cake.  And following that, we had to ask again for forks.  Also ordered 3 cappuchinos - 2 decaf, 1 regular.  All three came out decaf, and they looked like decaf coffee with a lump of foamed milk on top.  

In the end, we did get comped the bottle of wine.  I'm not sure if it was a kind gesture, or the waiter just forgot to toss it on there, he didn't say a word about it.  But in the end, I'm pretty sure we're not coming back."}
{"text":"Did you ever go somewhere and think you were somewhere else, or feel that you were supposed to think you were somewhere elsebut you were somewhere else but not that somewhere else, or think that you were supposed to think you were right where you are but you aren't really?  Me, too.

I got that feeling strolling the streets of Nouveau Hudson. (Or is it Nouvelle?  I'm not sure.)  It's a Crocker Park- Legacy Village-esque section of Hudson that is built to mimic old Hudson.  It does but it doesn't.  

All that metphysics made me hungry, so Mon cher chou, and Herself went to Vue to recharge.  It's a nice looking, upscale place that would not look out of place on East 4th or on the restaurantier side of West 6th.   The wait staff is extremely friendly and personable without being intrusive.

There was no children's menu, but the restaurant offered several child friendly dishes including spaghetti and mac and cheese.  Herself chose the mac, but we poached some.  (Thanks, try the veal.)  It was orrecchio with the creamiest cheese sauce I've ever had.  Num.  

The bread at the table was very good-- an italian and a foccacia.  However the \"tapenade\" seemed to be a pool of olive oil with a spoonful of actual tapinade in the middle.  I scooped out the drowning spoonful and found it to be tasty.

Mon Cher chou and I split some calamari.  It was light and crisp with a pepper glaze sauce and a creamy mustard sauce dizzled over.  I had scallops with ginger mushrom hash.  OK, I ordered it because I couldn't resist anything called ginger mushrooom hash.  The scallops were nicely done.  The hash-- needed some appreciable mushrooms-- but the ginger taste was nice and subtle.

Mon cher chou had the pasta with sun dried tomatoes and chicken.  Tasty, if a bit bland.  It needed more chicken to make it a good meal.

Overall: a decent meal in alleged Hudson."}
{"text":"This review is based off of their Sunday Brunch, I have not been to Vue for anything else so I can not comment, however, I have heard they have an excellent wine list.  Anyway....Their Sunday brunch is excellent, with made to order pasta and omelets, as well as pancakes, french toast, fresh fruit, several different salads, panko crusted grouper and a few other various pork and beef choices.  There is more than what I listed but my only complaint is that I feel there could still be a few more options for the $18.95 per person price.  For example, while I don't generally eat prime rib for brunch its a popular option that was not available here.  What I want to take the time to point out is all the ingredients in the salads, omelets, pasta and the fruit looked and tasted extremely fresh.  The omelet, the french toast and the grouper were probably my three favorite items.  The french toast has a cinnamon flavor with maybe a slight brown sugar crunch, it was not at all soggy and the topping choices of fresh berries, whipped cream, butter or warm ginger maple syrup were excellent.  Some of the best french toast I can remember to be honest.  The Panko crusted grouper was nice and light but still crispy and the grouper was not at all fishy, very fresh.   The omelet was huge, took up half the plate, but it was excellent as well, probably ranks near the tops for any buffet I can remember.  The only other knock is that beverages were not included at that price either.  I'd definitely go back but do acknowledge that its a little expensive but not too expensive that it should prevent you from giving it a try.  Every item was very tasty and I'd like to come back for Lunch or Dinner and see how they do there."}
