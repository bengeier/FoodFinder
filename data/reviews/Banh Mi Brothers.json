{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and starters. You can tell they're prepared with great care. Value is good, as well. Most sandwiches under 6 dollars after tax. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mediocre chain restaurants are the norm in this area, so finding this gem was a godsend.  We ordered the grilled pork and porchetta Banh Mi (both were incredibly fresh and delicious!), the egg rolls (good, and reminded me of lumpia), the sweet potato fries with a yummy honey sauce, and the next best thing to Pho in a bowl, which is their Pho-tine Fries.  Those babies left everyone craving more!   I only wish they had larger signage to attract more customers. The University area is bankrupt in its offerings of new and interesting places to eat, so we'd hate for this one to become yet another failed victim. Please, people, try this place and spread the word. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have driven by this store so many times and I finally decided to pop in. There was a young lady who was working the register who was very welcoming and knowledgable about the menu. Then a middle aged gentleman came up (I'm assuming the owner or the manager) and helped me choose my lunch. The staff was SUPER NICE and hospitable. Half way through eating someone stopped by and asked if everything tastes great and if they could grab me anything else. The food was also really good! Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"I've been 2 times in the last two weeks (after having gone for the 1st time). Got the porchetta with extra mayo both times because it was so good."}
{"text":"I ordered the bbq pork, pho-tine and Korean fries. Pho-Tine wasn't good. Korean fries deserves 1 star, BBQ pork was completely tasteless!!!"}
{"text":"An out of world experience. Once you walk into the establishment you will be greeted with a friendly gesture and lovely aroma of the porcheta being chopped up. The atmosphere is great and the music playing in the background varies from old school to laid back tunes. I highly recommend trying this restaurant out, it is Charlottes hidden gem. Don't knock it if you haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Blows every other banh mi I've had in Charlotte out of the water. Fresh baguettes and great pickled vegetables. Order the speciality porchetta banh mi - they slice and serve to order."}
{"text":"A bahn mi war started in charlotte and it makes me happy.    These delicious sandwiches are popping up all over the queen city and these guys have definitely earned their place.  Great staff and good food.  My goto sandwich is the porchetta, it's a flavor bomb and satisfies every single time.  Their seitan veggie sandwich is also top notch and their galbi fries is on point.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food! We got the Korean bahn mi, the grilled pork bahn mi and the galbi french fries. We were disappointed because we wanted to try their most popular entree - the porchetta bahn mi - but they said it would take an hour for it to be ready so we decided to pass on that. The food we got was great in flavor. The bahn mi bread was nicely toasted, just a bit hard to chew off. The korean meat was well flavored but the pork meat could've been flavored more. Fries were just okay; was missing a kick of flavor. Overall, however, the ambience was nice and we would come back to try more."}
{"text":"I had the pho banh mi, it was amazing and tasted so fresh! Also had the sweet potatoe fries- yummy! The owner was very friendly and personable, you can tell he really cares about his guests!  Restaurant was clean and sleek looking, I definitely recommend going here"}
{"text":"Before visiting this place, I've only eaten banh mi at Lee's Sandwiches. I've been hesitant to try them from anywhere else. However, I was craving banh mi while during our trip to Great Wolf Lodge and while doing a Yelp search, saw Banh Mi Brothers. They were given great reviews so we went. Walking in, the place was clean and smelled good. The menu had traditional banh mi items and some \"fusion\" style items. My wife ordered the Korean banh mi and a lychee smoothie with boba, my daughter had the grilled chicken, and I had the Pho with an avocado shake. We shared the galbi fries. The food was phenomenal. The meat is juicy, the veggies were crunchy, and the bread was toasty on the outside and soft in the inside. The food was so good I ordered two sandwiches to take home (we live a couple hours away).   Not only the food is great, but most important, the service is excellent. The employees were very polite and our food came out quickly. They even gave us samples of their pork rinds and pork belly, which were amazing.  Overall, this place gets five stars for great food and service. I hope the expand to the Cary/Raleigh area."}
{"text":"I think the idea of pho fusion fries and bahn mi sounds better than the reality. It's basically soggy fries with tons of hoison sauce. I saw a deep fryer but seriously I thought they were microwaved.  The bahn mi baguette was nice but the sandwich itself was really bland and flavorless. All I tasted was the mayonnaise. The cilantro had no flavor which was odd. Assumed it was not fresh.  The carrot and dicon doesn't taste pickled at all.  I really wanted this place to be good but is say 2.5 stars at best."}
{"text":"Had porchetta, rinds, rolls. All delicious. Subtleties in the flavors, attention to details"}
{"text":"Excellent! Very fresh, light, and delicious! Staff was very friendly and courteous! Excellent banh mi!!!"}
{"text":"Bbq pork has a lot of mayo and not a lot of meat. Summer tolls were okay, the sauce had a really thick consistency"}
{"text":"5 stars for service, flavor and freshness!  I've been here twice and had never eaten BanhMi before.   The Porchetta, which is the most popular, was fantastic but if you don't eat pork (or want to economize) the chicken was also very good.  The bread: best french bread I've had outside of New Orleans.  Atmosphere: none. Just a very clean sandwich shop."}
{"text":"By far the best banh mi I've ever had.  I had the porchetta banh mi and it was to die for.  The porchetta was perfectly cooked, the bread was fresh, and the pickled radish and carrots were very flavorful.  The specialty fries are a must-try as they are unique and delicious.  My other favorites are the pork rinds and fried chicken chunks."}
{"text":"If I could have the porchetta banh mi everyday I would (but you can't because the shop is closed on Mondays). It is the best sandwich, hands down. The crispy pork, that caramel sauce plus all the other banh mi essentials of the pickled veggies. Magic. You need to try this, and then get it again and again after you fall in love with it. Obsessed with the fries. Find me a basket of fries that are as hot and crispy. They're perfectly crispy. I crave those fries, and that sandwich. You've gotta go try this place out."}
{"text":"If you walk out of this place without a smile on your face and a full belly it's your own fault.  The quality of the meats, the portion size for Bahn Mi, the fantastic appetizers, all of it is just money.  I've had the summer rolls, the classic, and the Korean - all were fantastic.  It won't be long until I complete the menu.  Definitely worth the drive to university.  Sorry all other BM establishments in the QC, you won't have any of my cash for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh rolls, I really enjoyed the vegetarian roll. Everyone was so nice and the prices are a great deal for authentic Vietnamese with a hip twist like our sweet potato fries and home sauce."}
{"text":"Our new favorite lunch spot. Loved their milk tea! Having recently moved from San Francisco, I went from drinking boba almost everyday to not at all. I tried most of the boba places in Charlotte, and though I was desperate, I didn't find any that I really liked... until I had the milk tea at Banh Mi Brothers that is! The milk tea itself was so good that I didn't want to share with my husband. (Their boba balls were slightly hard.) The owner (I think), who happened to walk by when we were having this conversation, gave my husband one on the house. As if I wasn't sold on their boba alone, their service was just as exceptional!  Their food was just as delicious. My husband devoured their porchetta banh mi, and I enjoyed my summer rolls and fried chicken chunks. Everything about our experience here - from the food to service - was excellent. I only wish it was closer to us."}
{"text":"We went tonight for the first time, but certainly not the last time!  Ingredients were very high quality and the food was fantastic!  The menu was well thought out and executed perfectly!  The owner is very hands on and attentive to our needs.  He went out of his way to make us feel welcomed  and was truly interested in making sure we were satisfied with our meal choices.  As far as the value goes, it is a home run!  You can not go wrong and need to try this place!  You won't be disappointed!  So lucky to find such a great spot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I had the Porchetta Banh Mi and the pho fries.  The fries were outstanding. What a great value. I got the gravy on the side and I'm glad I did. I liked dipping the fries in the gravy so the fries did not get soggy. The Porchetta was really fatty for me, I know it should be. After I peeled off the fat, the sandwich was delicious. OMG the bread was flaky and fantastic."}
{"text":"University City is known for varied ethnic food from all around the globe and this place is a great addition to the restaurant scene in this area! Vietnamese street food is served here, with a hip American twist. I've tried most of the menu and it's all good. Vietnamese food isn't for everyone some of the flavors are out there, but it is worth a try! The menu is clear and the prices are good for what you get!"}
{"text":"The service was good, but our sandwiches were mislabeled which resulted in my love biting into a jalapeño which set his pie hole uh blaze! My poor baby...let me get my jalapeños tho...k thanks.  The food:  We ordered 2 Korean Banh Mi's, however, I just wanted a basic beef Banh Mi with all the fillings. So, we got it without the kimchee and jicama. The marinated beef had no real depth of flavor. It was sort of sweet, but bland as if it was boiled in sugar water. The pickled carrots and daikon were also sweet, not vinegary at all, and vinegar is what it needed. There wasn't enough cilantro for my liking and I did not taste the aioli at all. I had to add soy sauce to enhance the flavor. Overall, the balance of the sweet, salty and sour was missing.   Shrimp summer rolls-Meh. They could have used some cilantro and Thai basil to awaken the taste buds a bit. Also the lettuce had a lot of stalks attached.  Green paradise drink-was yummy and fresh. It was kind of thick like a meal in and of itself, so I drank it as a snack later.  In conclusion, the Banh mi bread and the green paradise were bomb. I wasn't blown away by anything. I may give it another try, but a sistah doesn't eat pork and that is primarily what they have on their sammich menu sooooooooooo. That is all."}
{"text":"This is the real deal banh mi place. The Pho Tine fries are really good. The best sandwich is the Porchetta. Great service with quick delivery."}
{"text":"Great green tea boba and Banh Mi! I had the chicken Banh Mi and my boyfriend had the classic. Both were delicious. I also had the green tea with mango and boba. This is a great fast casual place to get lunch with a nice clean and light setting. I'm definitely going back just for the mango green tea."}
{"text":"Amazing place, iced coffee was great. I got the grilled pork thit nuong and it was perfect. Fresh ingredients, pork was delicious and the bread was crisp. Amazing place and very affordable."}
{"text":"Today I was really craving a banh mi and I figured since it wasn't far from the university area I would give it a try. The place is really cozy, small, and still hip. I like the design of the place and how the menu is written in chalk, it definitely adds a creative feel to the place.   But what really got me is the fact they do a spin on your average Vietnamese banh mi. They have a specialty banh mi with Korean flavors. It has bulgogi and kimchi, along with cilantro, cucumber, and an aioli sauce that just melts with the bulgogi. It was HEAVENLY. I got the banh mi to-go, and you can tell they make it fresh because the bread was crispy and delicious.   Also the staff were really friendly. I was greeted with smiles and as I was leaving they smiled and said \"hope you have a nice day!\" Everything about the place seemed to give me good vibes and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love it this place has great friendly staff and the Banh mi sandwich I found my place, save me the trip go going to Asian corner now. There Gabi Korean fries are so good"}
{"text":"Got the original banh mi, pork rinds, galbi fries, mama Doan egg rolls, spring roll - all delicious!"}
{"text":"They have the best banh mi in Charlotte!  My husband and I ordered the BBQ and grilled pork banh mi, regular fries for my girl, green paradise smoothie, Thai tea and grilled pork roll.  Wow everything was so delicious from the first to the last bite.  Thai tea was so delicious my daughter drank most of it.  We even met Hau the owner.  He was a very down to earth guy and asked if we enjoyed the food.  We will definitely be back to get some more banh mi for sure!"}
{"text":"Move over Fusion Tea! This place is awesome. The food is soooo good here, u guys have to come and try this place. From the music to the person taking your order. Hau was so kind and cheerful willing to explain what was what with such patience, something you rarely get in these times. Im more than happy to spend my money there again. It was well worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the classic and the Korean banh mi sandwich and it was amazing! We also ordered the pho fries and the green paradise drink. Ugh! Let me just tell you, the fries were fire!!! So so so so so good! Tastes just like pho. On point ! The green paradise, that's another story. It literally took us to paradise. In my head, I wanted another one but I didn't say anything. My boyfriend asks \"would you like another one?\" I really wanted to but I passed on it because then I knew we'd be getting more than just another one haha. I didn't want to share. So the best drink award goes to green paradise ! It's a must have. Thank you for reading my long and very first yelp review ever. I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!!! Oh yeah and I forgot, the manager or owner or i don't even know came and checked up on us as well. He was very nice and explained that the green paradise was a good but also healthy drink. It is it is. I shall be back for it. Thank you banh mi brothers !"}
{"text":"Bahn mi are on point.  Very delicious and creative products.  No 5 stars because service is bit slow on a regular Sunday-not too busy"}
{"text":"Had the grilled pork bahn mi.  The bread was very nice - crispy outside, soft inside.  The pork was incredibly flavored. Ingredients were all very fresh.  They did the sandwich right, A+.  Also need to give honorable mention to the fries, they have really creative and delicious options for your fries.  I plan on going back often to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I tried a sample Vietnamese sandwich once before and have been wanting to get one from somewhere. Today I was able to do that! I decided to come because it had a high rating here on Yelp.   Since I'm new to this style of food I don't have anything to compare it to, but here were my thoughts during my experience:   The inside is small but tastefully decorated. The chalk wall was great! The lady at the counter was extremely nice. I asked for a recommendation and she said the most popular sandwich was the Porchetta - Heo Quay, so I got that. It had pork belly as the meat with carrots, cucumber, cilantro, jalapeño, pickled veggies (not a strong pickle flavor which I liked), and a caramelized sauce. Over all the flavor was tasty and refreshing. The sauce was extremely sweet. By the end of it my stomach started to hurt, but I have an extremely sensitive stomach so don't let that deter you if you have no diet restrictions! I also got the seasoned fries and they fried them up right when I ordered them so it tasted fresh!   Overall, good experience and I definitely want to go back and try some other items!"}
{"text":"Total surprise. Best lunch. Had Pho beef sandwich and the kale, banana & pineapple drink! Yummy! You must try their fries - delicious & really crispy!  As a visitor to Charlotte, I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi sandwiches in Charlotte ! I always order the chicken which is my favorite but the pork is also really good!! A lot of flavor in each bite and is paired best with their Vietnamese coffee, Green Paradise or Fruity Green Tea. Their staff is attentive and very friendly every time I visit and quick and fresh with every order. Keep it up !"}
{"text":"Overall, the banh mi doesn't stand out too much from all of the recent places that have popped up in Charlotte over the past two years. However, I do have to say they have interesting banh mi options. The one that is the tastiest is the porchetta banh mi and it's what makes me choose this place over others when deciding where I want to go for banh mi."}
{"text":"Just ordered this through uber eats, omg it was soooo good!!! Every thing was amazing and fresh. I will definitely be ordering again. He banh mi in particular was huge, perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"We've had takeout and eaten in several times. The BanhMi are always super fresh and delicious, but the real star of the show is their Vietnamese styled poutine fries. Omigod, the Pho-tine fries are out of this world. I'm also a huge fan of the chicken bites. Super tasty thigh meat with a sweet dipping sauce.  The other bonus is that it is all super affordable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Brothers is the perfect mix of modern quick dining and classic Vietnamese food.    We were able to try the Classic (highly recommend) and the Korean (delicious) Banh Mis.  Both were fantastic!  This restaurant is perfect for a quick meal or for take out orders and is definitely on the casual side.  There are so many delicious sounding dishes on the menu that we will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I stumbled across this wonderful place! I went in with a friend to grab a quick bite to eat for dinner, I ordered the Korean Bahn Mi. The guy at the register was super nice and chatty, which is always great! The sandwich was made quick, and had so much flavor to it. I wish this place was in my city because I would eat here all the time. I would highly recommend checking out this place if you are in the Charlotte area! Great food and super friendly people!"}
{"text":"Omg the best Vietnamese sandwich sub in town. So fresh lots of meat not cheap with veggies over the top. The girl Who took my order was super cute and sweet too. I'm coming back tomorrow"}
{"text":"First banh mi place I've tried since I've moved here...and it's pretty darn good!! Definitely will be back.."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a banh mi connoisseur having tried many versions, but the true sign that lets you know you're going to sink your teeth into a delicious banh mi is that Vietnamese butta'.   This place is on point.  They're doing it right. They know that butter makes it better (it's actually mayo, but just play along)! Unless it's spreading out the sides a little bit or maybe even mixing with the juices of the vegetables and meats and dripping deliciousness  when you tilt for the bite, you will not get the optimal experience.  Good toast on the bread that doesn't crumble and the vegetables were crisp and fresh.  Up to this point, you might be assuming I had a meat filled sandwich, but I am giving these accolades based on ordering a vegetarian banh mi....and I'm not even vegetarian.  I've been all over the country and have never seen any authentic vegetarian option aside from tofu, so I had to try their version and it was great.  Rivals the best of the best meat counterparts I've had elsewhere.  Haven't had one here yet to make an in house comparison but if the foundation is good and the skin on the porchetta on that cutting board looks crisp, one can imagine.  It's obvious they're out here sharing a vision of their dream.  Come out and experience a piece of it."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! If you are thinking about trying it ... do it! It's amazing the golbi fries are delicious. I had the porchetta Bahn mi and it was super tasty! Definitely would recommend! It's really good and worth the try! Will be coming ba"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, this place was pretty friggin amazing.  You might not ever see me at Mr. Le's again.  They only make a limited number of porchetta sandwiches per day, and I guess I was a little late.  So I ordered the \"pho\".  The menu doesn't specify that its a \"pho sandwich\", but I assumed so and I assumed right.  The meat was not extremely flavorful or abundant for this sandwich that cost almost twice as much as the others.  But the bread and veg were spot on.  I still have faith.  I'll just go for the cheaper banh mi's next time, if the porchetta isn't available.  Me and my buddies also got all kinds of apps too.  Spring rolls were decent, same with the egg rolls, but the real winner here was the fries.  Topped with marinated beef and kimchi it was absolutely perfect.  Probably the best $5 in Charlotte honestly.  I'll be back just for that dish and will probably still get a sandwich as well."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I am vegetarian/vegan and enjoyed the vegetarian bahn mi. I am so glad places are offering more vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were looking for a place to go eat in the University area and I came across this place thanks to Yelp! I'm so glad we ended up coming here because it was so delicious. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by this man and sorry I didn't catch your name. But he was very helpful and the service was fast. My husband and I will be returning and I'm already telling my friends and family members about this awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the classic and the Korean banh mi, both very good. Will definitely be back to try others on the menu. Awesome service also!"}
{"text":"This was delicious and flavorful. I'm in the hospital and they delivered so quickly with hot fresh food. Made my entire night!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting today, came based on previous reviews and was not disappointed! Tried \"The Korean Banh Mi,\" \"Grilled Chicken Banh Mi,\" and the \"Pho-Tine Fries.\" Everything was DELICIOUS!!!! What a great place! Friendly staff and clean, what more could you want? My only regret is not moving fast enough to snap a pic before my husband started devouring everything."}
{"text":"Awesome Bahn Mi sandwiches and the bubble tea is on point. We were just stopping by to grab a super charge an exit away and decided to give this place a try.  It was a great decision. Recommend the chicken Bahn Mi sandwich and the Thai ice tea with boba."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Banh Mi restaurants that often but I'm so glad I found this one while I was in Charlotte for work. When I walked up to the counter, I was greeted by How who was so friendly and willing to answer any questions I had regarding the sandwiches. I ordered the Korean Banh Mi which was brought to my table very quickly and tasted phenomenal. The fresh cilantro and cucumbers along with the cilantro-aioli really gave it great flavor. The beef was cooked to perfection and there was an ample amount. I was also pleasantly surprised that the sandwich was only $6.50 considering it's generous size.   I enjoyed listening to the early 2000s pop/hip-hop music that was playing in the restaurant and appreciated that there was sriracha on each table (I add it to everything). When I was finished my meal, How kindly picked up my trash and asked me how everything was. The overall experience was very pleasant and I'll definitely return next time I'm back in this area!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  I love  this place , best vegetarian Banh mi . If I could give 10 stars I would!"}
{"text":"My coworkers made me try this place once and I was expecting low quality Vietnamese sandwich shop, but these guys really impressed me. I highly suggest u try them out. The only complaint I have is that they don't have a soda fountain machine and that's why they get a 4 star."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Wife and I had the Porchetta and Korean Banh Mi and the Galbi Fries. Everything was perfect. We will be back very soon. We need one of these in S. Charlotte."}
{"text":"We've been here twice in two weeks. We've tried the porchetta, Korean and chicken sandwiches and we overwhelmingly love the Korean! The kimchi with the savory Korean marinated beef is the perfect combination. I just wish the sandwiches were a little bigger. The porchetta sandwich comes in a close second. The crackle is extremely crunchy...imagine the crunch of brittle, but harder. Yes! But the flavor of the sandwich is very good. The fresh cilantro on top of their sandwiches...hmmmmm, it really makes a difference. The cilantro just takes it to another level of YUMMY! The chicken sandwich is very good as well, the jalapeno peppers give it just enough kick to have you reaching for your Thai tea. And speaking of the Thai tea...it's sinfully delicious. I try to savor mine, but it's very difficult not to inhale it. Everyone who we've interacted with here have been extremely nice and helpful in helping us make our food selections. Next time, we are trying the fries. This place has officially been put in our Yelp \"FAVORITES\" category."}
{"text":"Had a friend take me to this place , I was very skeptical because I had never had or heard of A Banh mi sandwich. Wow! I would eat here at least 3 times a week if it was near by my house. Also the owner Hau is Rad! Check it out or don't if you don't want to get hooked! No you should definitely check it out, I'm huge fan if you can't tell! Grilled Pork is my Favorite"}
{"text":"Right when I walked in, the tasty aroma of the shop made me even more hungry. I asked what they recommended and all their suggestions were delicious: pho fries, porchetta banh mi, and Vietnamese iced coffee. I entered hungry and hungover, but I exited happy and with a newborn food-baby. Will definitely be bringing all my friends and family here in the future."}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about this place. The food is so affordable but not lacking in flavor or texture. The bread itself is amazing already-warm and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. (If you get takeout, the bread won't be as crunchy for obviously reasons. But they're still yummy) Portion sizes are very satisfying too. If you're here with friends i recommend getting a bit bunch of different banh mi's and sharing. GET THE GALBI FRIES. Just get it. Jesus will be proud of you for doing so. The boba in the bubble teas are very satisfactory too--perfectly chewy without feeling mushy. I'm sitting in a sort of happy food coma as I write this now. Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. My girlfriend and I were in town to shop at IKEA. On our way home we were in need of some nourishment and found Banh Mi Brothers. I was looking for food that was relatively healthy and fast. I found what I was looking for here. Excellent service, friendly and clean. A must try place for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is LITTY. The girl at the front counter was super helpful with the menu, she even offered me a sample of the boba tea to make sure I liked it. The food came out quickly and it was excellent. The fries are really a whole meal and they were so good. I also got a classic sandwich, excellent!  I love this place, and on top of all the other great stuff; this place was super fast, something that is important to me on a short lunch break. Loved it."}
{"text":"My go to spot for banh mi and they have awesome shakes and teas. The bbq pork is fantastic. Oh did I mention super affordable?"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Fries are enough for 3. Banh mi is better than most places I've been to. Staff is friendly, place is clean"}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews, I stopped by to check things out and as usual had a hard time deciding what to order, even with their limited menu I still had issues.  I really didn't want a sandwich, but noticed how reasonable the sandwich prices were compared to other places.  I will definitely try a sandwich on my next visit.  They have pork belly that was recommended by the young lady taking orders and she let me sample it and it was very tasty and tender, but I finally decided on the fresh summer rolls and the pho-tine fries.  The fries were covered with brisket, cilantro and scallions.......yummy!  It came with gravy on the side but I didn't use any of it as it was already perfect without it.  The summer rolls were really fresh and come with an almond butter sauce that was really good.  This spot has really good food and with really great prices, I see why they're such a favorite."}
{"text":"YES YES YES!! The best banhmi in town, hands down! The got the porchetta which had porkbelly and it was absolutely amazing! They stuffed it with both crunchy and soft porkbelly. The bun was nice and crispy so it didn't get soggy either. The flavor was more than you expected for a banhmi and I loved it! We also had the galbi fries which had kimchi on top. Again the best! I've tried a lot of different types of kimchi fires but these beat everyone else's IN CHARLOTTE. I definitely recommend this place to anyone. It's inexpensive and the food is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I had a patient that recommended this place to me a couple months back and I finally had the chance to try them out today. IM SO GLAD I DID! My hubby and I ordered the spring rolls as appetizers; they were delicious. I got the classic Banh mi & my hubby tried the grilled pork Banh mi. Both were amazing. I also got the milk tea with boba and I have to say that it's the BEST milk tea I've had since being in Charlotte (originally from Chicago, been here 4 years). I was told the milk tea is actually made in-house & not the powder form, so maybe that's why it's so amazing! We will definitely be back by next week! Lol!"}
{"text":"Great taste and amount for the price you pay. Located in University area makes it good for lunch or dinner and not your typical banh mi. They got specialty banh mi flavors and the classics. Definitely more modernized shop with refreshing drinks!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I am big on service, so I was happy about the big smile I received when it was my turn. I got there about an hour before close, too, so if you can keep smiling that sincerely all day, good on you.  I decided on the Chinese BBQ pork because why get that one delicious thing that everyone else is raving about? I loved my sandwich. The meat was fresh and nicely seasoned. The veggies were crisp. The bread was nice and crunchy outside, soft inside, and just big enough to balance the fillings without being too much.  I also got the Pho-tine fries. They were good, but not good to me. Does that make sense? They were hot, fresh, well made, and well seasoned, but there is some flavor in particular Asian cuisines that I cannot identify that I do not like at all. It was in the gravy, but please, by all means give them a try. If you don't mind whatever that flavor is, you will love those fries.   Large portions, reasonable prices, friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago for lunch and was delightful. Tried their pork belly sandwich and the fries with loaded toppings. Great service and even better food!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while on a road trip and the food was so good! We had the grilled chicken and Korean Banh Mi and the sweet potato fries.    Will be back the next time we're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from CharlotteAgenda.com.  They had stated that it was a great restaurant for banh mis.  Since I was in the University area, I decided to visit and see if it was worth the review.  When you first walk in you see this large black board with all the menu items listed for you to decide on what to order.  From there the staff I friendly and waited as I decided what to order.  To me, the best way to determine if the banh mi is good is to see how they handle the classic cold cut banh mi.  Because if the classic is not up to par, how can the rest of the banh mi be any better.  I ordered the cold cut banh mi, sweet potato fries, and a lychee green tea.  The order did not arrive all at once. The tea came first, then the sweet potato fries, and finally the banh mi. The great thing was that, even though the order did not arrive at the same time, each item came with enough time for me to taste and savor the flavor of each item.  I love lychee and the lychee flavor came on strong in the green tea. The banh mi was good. Lots of vegetables and the cold cuts was tasty. I was disappointed that I could see any liver pate, which is a big part of the banh mi experience.  I heard, from another store owner, the reason why most places don't use the pate is due to the American palate.  Which is a real shame, because it complements/enhances the sweetness of the pickled vegetables.  However, not to be disappointed, I decided to try the special Porchetta banh mi.  I can say that the pork belly was extremely tasty. However, the cracklings was extremely hard. Enough so, that I had to use my fingers to remove the crackling from my mouth.  Between the liver pate and the cracklings, I had to drop a star. But, I would still highly recommend the restaurant to others."}
{"text":"The most interesting restaurant that's opened in this area of town in a million years.   Get the pho fries. It's like a magic trick if you love pho. Their bahn mi is dope. I can't wait to visit again to try more of their menu and some of the fruit drinks/bubble tea."}
{"text":"Incredible Banh Mi! I had the Porchetta - Heo Quay and it is a roasted pork belly, cracklings, and a savory sweet Carmel sauce.. this isn't any average porkbelly. This is a 5hr roasted pork belly wrapped around a pork tenderloin and seasoned with Chinese 5-Spice. The 5hr roast makes the skin on the pork belly perfectly crunchy and this is what makes the \"crackling\" portion of the Banh Mi. I will definitely be back!! So good"}
{"text":"It was pretty bad.. order bbq pork banh mi and porchetta banh mi.. both disappointing.. No flavor.. dry bread.. could use soy sauce and more mayo. And for the price.. the banh mi is fairly small. Nothing beats Mister Le's.. hands down the best banh mi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A relatively new Banh Mi joint in the Grand Promenade shopping center? I'm game!  You walk in and are consumed by a predominately white-modern decor with unique seating near the walls and a chalkboard menu, very creative on the decor. The restaurant looks very well kept and clean, as do the restrooms! Really happy when the restrooms match the cleanliness of the rest of a restaurant (well... most of the time!).  Second time here, I was really drawn to the Pho-tine this time, their play on Poutine. They serve shoestring fries topped with brisket, cilantro, and a 'pho-reduced gravy'. I thought the gravy was a little too light for my taste, a little bit of salt would have carried it a ways. Brisket was excellent, added a little sriracha to spice it up a bit.  The banh mi was great. I got the BBQ Pork Sandwich, the bread was crispy/warm and the pork moist, savory, a little tangy. Keep in mind this isn't your usual bbq, don't expect a vinegar-tomato sauce to accompany it, it's hard to describe but it is delicious.  I really wish I had gotten a chance to try their Vietnamese Coffee, but they were out. Seemed like 12:30 on a Saturday should be prime time for premium beverages, oh well. Better luck next time.  Great couple of visits. For the convenience of the location I can see bringing some of my friends that are less experienced in banh mi and introducing them to a whole new sandwich spectrum."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff serving up large portions of classic and twisted versions of banh mi sandwiches.  I had the classic and my wife had the porchetta.  Both were great.  The kids loved the chicken chunks and fries.   Have to admit I ate half of them.  They also serve boba teas, smoothies and Vietnamese coffee.  Thanks Hau!  Next time I visit I will try the pho-tine fries."}
{"text":"One of the best banh mis I've ever had. ALSO they have vegan options that are truly phenomenal. Try the bbq vegan banh mi it is delicious and will not regret it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our banh mi experience here! We've heard about the porchetta (crispy pork belly) banh mi and the galbi fries and had to try it for ourselves. We were greeted with friendly staff who provided excellent customer service by giving us recommendations on what to get. The food came out fast and fresh. The fries had a generous portion and all of the toppings made it very well balanced. The porchetta banh mi is the most expensive thing on the menu and I can \"taste\" why - the pork belly was full of flavor and crisp! The owner makes a limited amount of crispy pork to retain its full crispy texture so you know you are getting quality when you order this banh mi. What we really appreciate the most about our experience is being greeted by the owner himself. He took the time out to ask us how the food and service was and was very genuine to his customers. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My new go to spot for banh mi ! First time coming here today and I ordered the banh mi grilled pork with galbi fries and milk tea. Everything tasted amazing ! Friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled pork banh mi! The Vietnamese coffee and Thai iced tea were great too- boba is free of charge as well! Not to mention that the prices are extremely reasonable. Amazing. The owner (I believe) came over to check on us as well which was very nice. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"A trip to IKEA in Charlotte always means another opportunity to try out somewhere new to eat and Banh Mi Brothers won us over this time. The people working here were all really nice and our food came out quickly.  I tried both the porchetta banh mi and the classic banh mi. While the porchetta one was good, I think it was a little pricey and I ended up enjoying the classic much more. The ingredients on both sandwiches were very fresh.  And while we are always up for a delicious banh mi, the main thing that brought me to visit Banh Mi Brothers was the pictures of the Galbi French fries. While I wouldn't advise getting the fries plain, because they don't seem like they are fresh cut by any means, definitely get the Galbi fries! The fries were topped with some Korean beef, kimchi, scallion and a cilantro aioli. I don't know why I've never seen this done before, because it was delicious and packed full of flavor!   Overall, I would say it is a little pricey for the banh mi's since we are used to getting them closer to $4 each. However it is worth a visit to try the fries! I am incredibly curious about the pho-tine fries too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new restaurants! The sandwiches are delicious, and love the modern twists to the classic banh mi sandwiches, like the korean and Porchetta. Also give the korean fries & chicken chunks a try!"}
{"text":"Have been twice and have been extremely happy with my selections. The traditional Banh Mi is really good,  love the pate. The Pho Banh Mi is super good. Be sure to add a fried egg to your sandwich or fries."}
{"text":"TL;DR:  It scratches the banh mi itch, but does not impress.  Food - 2.5/5 - Certainly could be a preference thing, but the ratios don't seem right.  I've tried both a specialty banh mi (Korean) and a regular char siu (roast prok) banh mi.  For the Korean, I ate it in the restaurant but the thing was practically dripping.  The Kimchi was far too wet and when combined with the other sauces, it ended up getting soggy and unenjoyable extremely quickly.  For the roast pork from the traditional menu, the ratios were better, but it was too heavy on the mayo.  That can certainly be preference, but most other banh mi's the mayo (if there is any) is light and just blends with the flavor.  This one had a distinct mayo taste, which I don't prefer.  My wife had other 'ratio' type issues with hers as well.  Flavor is good, but the execution is inconsistent.  However, the bread was fantastic!  Whoever their baker is does an excellent job with having nice crispy bread with a fluffy inside.  In summary, decent flavor, but poor, inconsistent execution.  We also got a mango smoothie.  It was definitely on the icey side, but had good flavor.    Price - 3/5 - On par with other Banh Mi in the area.  Service - 3/5 - Similar to the food, it was inconsistent.  There was no sriacha on the tables.  They were apparently refilling?  Would recommend not refilling ALL the bottles at the same time.  We asked if the Smoothie came with Boba, which they confirmed it did. When it showed up, no boba :(.  They were very quick at getting us sriracha and adding boba.  So no real issue, but maybe they need to refine their policies and procedures.  Ambiance - 4/5 - Crisp and clean and the chalkboard is fun."}
{"text":"This place really goes out of their way to make sure you're \"wowed.\" I thought the service was spectacular. While I've had Banh Mi before, it was so nice to have them walk me through the menu and explain the flavoring and pairings of each thing.   This place is counter service, so very fast if you're trying to get a delicious, quick meal.  The food is incredibly flavorful and fresh, and I know made with love. I was thoroughly impressed and satisfied with my entire experience here and will return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Boy was I craving a good banh mi and boy did Banh Mi Brother deliver! My beau and I stopped by while passing through Charlotte and was pleasantly surprised that not only did they serve delicious sandwiches, they have a pretty wide menu that can satiate all of your Vietnamese cravings! We both ordered the porchetta banh mi with roasted pork belly- I could resist, they cut the meat in front of you! We also ordered from fresh spring rolls and the fried chicken as an appetizer. So... the porchetta actually wasn't as good as I thought it would be- I think it's because we went at an awkward time at 3 pm when there's some leftovers from the lunch rush but the preparations for the dinner rush hasn't commenced either. As such, the cut on the pork belly was far more fat than meat. Still the potential is there! I really liked that they load your sandwich with lots of vegetables and lots of jicama, making it taste extremely fresh. The fried chicken was delectable- extremely crispy and well seasoned. The spring rolls on the other hand were.... not great. There just wasn't vegetables and way too much noodles in it so there just wasn't a crunch."}
{"text":"I love the pho fries! It really does taste like pho because of the gravy and the slices of brisket is so tender!! Everyone is friendly and they really do care about their customers. I would highly recomend this place if you haven't trird it yet."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through Instagram and decided to give it a try as I love Banh Mi sandwiches.It definitely met my expectations.I also ordered a mango bubble tea which was good and topped off my meal.I will be back again and I recommend others to try it out!"}
{"text":"OMGoodness. The bubble teas are simply amazing and the food is so crisp and good. The environment is very fast and it puts you in the sense of a walk in fast-food Resturant."}
{"text":"Great Service, the cashier recommended a great sandwich. My personal favorite is the Korean."}
{"text":"This place has the best egg rolls in Charlotte. You have to go here and try the egg rolls. They are so good. The flavor is so strong and inviting. You will want 1 then two then 4 then 8 then you can get a banh mi, pho fries, Korean BBQ fries, boba tea, Thai tea, and just about anything. This place is inviting and nice atmosphere to bring the whole family and the prices are awesome. The family is super nice and really inviting. This is a must try. Go there today as soon as you read this awesome place. Just awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best Banh Mi spot in all of Charlotte. I never write Yelp reviews but after visiting this one I felt compelled to let everyone know this is the place to go. The standard grilled pork was my order today, it was extremely tasty. But man oh man did I make a mistake, the Porchetta is the move here, I got a sample and I will be ordering it next time for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite place for banh mi's in university city area. the food is great and decor is hip and new. SO tries something different every time we go but Im less adventurous and get the grilled pork bahn mi. Very delicious! Also folks are super friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great vegan and vegetarian banh-mi options including marinated seitan, chay and mushroom banh mis. They also have condensed soy milk vietnamese coffee and vegan summer rolls and fries. Fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Great food, healthy options, excellent service, kind employees, nice casual atmosphere, all for the price of junky fast food."}
{"text":"This place is fucking awesome. The guy who owns it is a nice dude and the pork specialty sandwich is bomb.  Tried the bulgogi fries and they were alright, but honestly, fuck fries.  Get the sandwich, put it under your arm, and go see the world with it.  This sandwich makes you want to go see the world.  Ok thats a bit much. It was good af tho."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Awesome people. Really good food. We tried so many different things and they were all great. Phone was in the car, so I couldn't take pics, but I tried the Korean Banh Mi and fries, pork rinds, and a couple other Banh Mi sandwiches. They were all good, but the Korean versions were my favorite."}
{"text":"The best vegan Bahn Mi in town.  Hands down. The Thai tea with soy milk is really good.  The owners are awesome and super nice ."}
{"text":"The pho fries tasted just like pho and I'm still confused but they were enjoyable! I would not recommend the bulgolgi fries however. To me the cilantro aioli was just mayo and the flavors didn't work well since it dry and flavorless somehow. Eitheway the portions are very filling, so I would recommend sharing them with friends!  The banh mi's dare very filling and flavorful so I would recommend getting those! I'm top choice would be the BBQ pork."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here during the grand opening so there was a pretty long line but that was to be expected.   The place was clean and the decor was kept simple and minimal. The menu was written on a chalkboard and there's not too much on the menu to get overwhelming but enough to have options which i really like.   My friend and I got the BBQ pork Banh Mi and it was pretty good. It was flavorful but nothing special. The milk tea was ok. A tad bit bland. And the last thing we got were the seasoned fries. I didn't really like this. There wasn't much seasoning on it and a bit too crispy for my taste. It definitely look and smell better than it taste.   I'll probably come back and give this place another try. I do think they have good potential to be really good."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I'm so glad I finally made it. It is easy to find in the Grand Promenade shopping center. My lunch date and I shared an order of Yum Yum pork rinds that were still warm and crackling when they arrived at our table. It was love at 1st bite. Then came our bahn mi. We shared a traditional grilled chicken and a specialty porchetta. Both were outstanding. The meat was tender, the veggies were fresh, and the bread was just right. I also indulged in a fruity green tea and found it very refreshing. Top it all off with great service and you've got my new favorite place for a quick bite. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A great Banh Mi that is comparable to any other spot in town. I ordered the traditional BBQ pork but will come back to try some of their other menu items like the pho-tine fries or the porchetta Banh Mi."}
{"text":"We went to Banh Mi Brothers for the first time on Sunday. What a great place!! Yummy food, super nice staff!! Would recommend!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Had heard about Banh Mi Brothers and was able to try it at the December yelp event.  Was looking forward to a full meal and finally got the opportunity to visit.  It was a good experience and would go back when we were in the area.    I had the Porchetta and my wife had the traditional Grilled pork Bahn Mi.  We also ended up sharing an order of the Galbi fries.  Both sandwiches were good and had a lot of flavor.  I enjoyed the jalapeño in the Porchetta and got a nice jolt in the process.  I do question the 2.50 increase for the Porchetta (but at the end of the day, I did enjoy it).  The Galbi fries were a nice change of pace and really enjoyed the different flavors.  That could be someones meal.    Service was good.  You order from the counter and they bring it to the table.  They did check on us a few times during our meal which was a nice touch.    This is a good place to visit for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We were looking to mix it up last week. I found this place and Yelp and decided to try it out after reading so many positive reviews. As DJ Khaled would say, here's \"another one.\"  We ordered the Pho-Tine Fries, Pho Bahn Mi, Kim-chi Bahn Mi, Summer Spring Rolls, and a Thai Tea. The Pho-Tine Fries were out of this world! If you love the flavor of Pho you will absolutely love this. The gravy is plate licking good. The Summer Spring Rolls were also perfect. 4 large shrimp were in each roll with an awesome Thai dipping sauce. I saved the sauce and used it later with my sandwich because it was so good. My Pho Bahn Mi was fantastic. Great spices and full of flavor. The bread they use has the best crunch and suits the Bahn Mi perfectly. My boyfriend's Kim-chi Bahn Mi was a little on the spicy side, but he loved it. He doesn't typically put may on sandwiches, but commented that the flavor was perfect and he wouldn't change a thing.  The Thai Tea was the only let down for me. We added boba to it and it was just way too sweet. Glad we tried it, but in the future I'd skip this.  The owner was there and was super friendly. We dined in and were really happy with our experience. Fun place to try!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I had a chicken banh mi, it was delicious. The chicken breast was grilled perfectly, the bread was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. My husband had the the porchetta banh mi that he really enjoyed as well."}
{"text":"We ordered a few different sandwiches to go but had the Korean Bahn Mi and it was very good!!!  We took the rest home and warmed them up in the oven and they were still good after being in the frig for a few days.  The grilled chicken, classic bahn mi, and bbq pork were all good.  Nice clean flavors, not too porky/swiney but I do think they need to add a little more meat to their sandwiches.  The best part was the amazing customer service.  The vietnamese iced coffee had a slightly different flavor, not the typical Cafe Du Monde notes.  We would definitely go back to try all the other menu items."}
{"text":"Food usually good! However I ordered two sandwiches recently and the messed them both up! Added mayo and pickled vegetables when order clearly says neither."}
{"text":"This place is new. I decided to try them out, since I LOVE TEA FUSION (another Vietnamese place)   It was ok   I had the Veggie with egg, it looked good. The bread was a to hard for my likings. But I did not eat it because my eyes was playing tricks on me with their soak fried flour (see photo)  that they have on veggie sandwich. My son said it was really good tho. I also had the Thai tea with bobba which was really good.   Inside: the window was really foggy, maybe someone don't know how to clean glass correctly. The floors looked (see photo) dirty, but as I was looking at the other photos, I just think that's how they are. Maybe they need new floors, it's really noticeable and make the place looks dirty when it's not. They have a good amount of tables   Employees: I did not get a friendly welcome, the question should have been \"Hello, have you ever been here before?\" If the customer says no then maybe they should say, \"Well let me tell you some of our most popular things on the menu\". Because you can tell when it's someone first time there,  they will have a clueless look (and I did)."}
{"text":"Most possibly one of the 'Best Tasting', 'Lowest Priced' Vietnamese Sandwich Restaurants in Charlotte.  Located within walking distance from UNCC.  I was extremely pleased; and I'm sure anyone else will too.  I'm totally for family owned and operated restaurants. I hope others are the same. Please give these nice folks your business. You'll definitely be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying where have you been all my life! This was one of the best surprises I've had on a lazy Wednesday evening. Tried a banh mi sandwich which had an explosion of flavors especially the kimshi, ginger, and cilantro OMG! The bread was perfect as well. Also the beef was full of flavor and finally tried the fries equivalent to the sandwich with that aioli, Well Done see you guys real soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I was very skeptical in trying this but I order the brisket sandwhich and the marinated korean beef covered fries with the green tea with mango fruit. OMG. best meal ive had in years! The drink was sooo good too! Pretty good with the little jel balls and fruit. Will be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"I went very close to closing time but the staffs were extremely friendly. They have amazing Banh mi. If you are a meat eater you definitely should try the grill pork Banh mi. The pork is tender and moist. The bread is warm. I had the vegetarian banh mi and it was delicious. I am glad they open near the University. They are generous with the portion. Amazing Thai tea."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, kind of expensive for what it is and isn't too filling. The atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences. The staff was okay, just answered my questions but didn't do any other interactions since they seemed more focus on their coworkers and messing with them. But other than that, it is nice to see something different in the area. Maybe next time I'll try something different if I decide to come back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends and everything we tried was so good!  Ordered the tom yum pork rinds, mama doan egg rolls, summer rolls, galbi fries, pho-tine fries, classic banh mi, grilled pork banh mi and (my absolute favorite) porchetta banh mi.  Get there early for the porchetta one as it's a limited quantity each day!"}
{"text":"The food here was ok. The service was great. I will recommend It if you are in the area looking for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Friendly people, cheerful casual setting, and great value!!  The food is delicious. Because I dislike cilantro, I haven't been a big fan of Banh Mi sandwiches in the past. This place will customize as you wish, and it's terrific!  The roll was warm and toasty, the vegetables crisp and tasty, and the chicken tender and delicious. I also had the summer rolls-- fresh and light with a delightful dipping sauce. And the peach fruit tea was wonderful. I will definitely return when I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Fantastic vietnamese foods! I got the classic Banh mi (classic-thit nguôi), best Banh mi I've had since I left Arlington. And The Gimkim fries were awesome, loaded with kimchi, cilantro, meat and a creamy sauce. Also regarding beverages, you can add Boba to any of their teas. Thai tea was great and they also have a blend of 5 herbal flower tea, supposedly for a \"hang over cure\" ."}
{"text":"I discovered Bahn Mi because on Friday's there is a food truck that stops by my office at lunch time (Yummy Bahn Mi) I was so excited when I found this place but was so disappointed. Food didn't taste fresh and bread was stale. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very fresh and owner takes pride in quality and service! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST-try! Cancel whatever lunch/dinner plans you have and come here instead. I promise, you won't be disappointed!  We ordered the Galbi Fries, the Korean Specialty Bahn-Mi, and the BBQ pork Bahn-Mi. All were absolutely incredible (and I've been out East and eaten authentic Pho, Bahn-mi, etc), and the Galbi fries were gone in 2 min flat. The kimchi is homemade, and you can definitely taste the difference. The aioli and pickled vegetables are the perfect complement on the sandwiches, and balance the other rich flavors out. We also ordered the Lychee and Mango fruity green teas, and they were amongst the best bubbles teas I've tasted too!  While we were eating, the owner came over and introduced himself, and you can tell he has a tremendous amount of passion for what he does; it shows in every aspect of this restaurant. The staff is friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere is bright and laid back, and the food is a delicious and incredible value! I don't normally go on and on like this, but this place deserves it. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with my visit to BahnMi Brothers after recently coming back to Charlotte and seeing that a new fast casual restaurant had opened in the University area.  I'm a bit confused why the vegetarian bahn mi costs more than the other choices with meat. $6 for some bread, mayo, and pickled vegetables? That's a far stretch. My second let down is that when I went to open my \"vegetarian\" sandwich, there was a full layer of what appeared to be cooked pork. Was there a mix-up at the register? Perhaps, but it wasn't a busy time in the restaurant so I would have hoped for a little more carefulness. Luckily, I'm not a strict (or religious) vegetarian, or this would have been inedible.   I'm sure, like at any restaurant, there are on and off days. I'm bummed to have had my only experience on an off day, but I'm also reluctant to give it another chance."}
{"text":"My favorite banh mi shop! Has a ton of character from the food to the atmosphere and staff! Recommend the grilled pork and all their choices of fries!"}
{"text":"First time, i had the Korean sandwich it was not good at all. I've had Tea Fusion's Korean sandwich and it was so much better. I do like the green paradise smoothie though and i requested no banana and add honey  instead and they made it possible."}
{"text":"The service was good, took awhile to get waters we asked for. We tried the Korean BBQ fries it was very salty. I got the original bang mi which it was good."}
{"text":"Food is so tasty and the staff were so friendly...my new addiction! So many different options of banh mi definitely not the typical banh mi restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Banh Mi Brothers after trying a few of their sandwiches at a Yelp event and I'm sad that I waited this long to make the trip. Not only was the food delicious but everyone is so nice and happy that you can't help but leave in a good, positive mood!  The sandwiches we debated on getting were the porchetta, grilled pork, and the pho banh mis. We ended up getting the porchetta and pho. Both were delicious with the porchetta being my favorite and the pho being my fiancé's favorite. They also gave us samples of the grilled pork fresh off the grill and it was really tasty. We ended up getting a Korean banh mi to go and I have a feeling I won't be disappointed.  Not only do they make banh mis, but they also have a lot of appetizers, sides, and drink options. I'll definitely be back several times to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I was at the oasis shriner for a vietnamese association held new year festival, i did not have cash with me and the vendors on site only accepted cash. I began looking at places nearby to eat, of course vietnamese places, because I was trying to have what I could not at the venue!  There are a number of asian restaurants in the same shopping center. I walked in to banh mi bros and was greeted by a scent of grilling. Then i saw the delicious looking pork bellies.   $8ish for the fancy banh mi's here. I am against paying a lot for banh mi's because i think the best ones are fresh, crispy and cheap! Unlike sushi, banh mi's should not be expensive. I decided against getting the porchetta which is the only banh mi that had pork belly in it. I tried the cured pork and bbq pork, the cured pork is very tender and definitely above and beyond other banh mi places in charlotte for the execution. The bbq pork was less special. The milk tea was good, not great, slightly cheaper than the tea place nearby. The banh mi's are long and skinny, so they were a good size.  Bathrooms here are clean and they made good use of the space in the restaurant to make sure there is ample seating.  What i did not like is seeing a worker texting while scrubbing and open fire grill, huge safety and sanitation hazard. Also it took literally 25 min for my order to come out!!! Most people do not have that kind of time or patience for a to go order. I came at 3:30 in the afternoon so there weren't even a lot of people there. Banh mi's do not take long to make."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere with great staff. The upbeat music and clean eating areas made it a refreshing experience. Pho gravy is a bit strong for me. Got the fries and they were solid"}
{"text":"I love this place! I ordered a Vietnamese sub and fried  chicken thigh chunks with a thai tea to wash it down. My son and daughter ordered the chicken chunks and spring rolls. The owners son heard me mention that I loved kimchi so he put extra kimchi on my sub! The kimchi was the best that I had ever tasted! The sub was soooo delicious and the chicken chunks were better than Chik Fil a! I will be back today :)"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Brothers is a unique Vietnamese sandwich shop that has traditional and nontraditional banh mi sandwiches as well as some interesting french fry combinations. I tried the classic banh mi sandwich ($5) and the porchetta banh mi ($7.50). The classic was every bit as traditional as a banh mi. The ham, headcheese, pork, and pate all tasted fine, and the vegetables were all fresh tasting. The bread was decent and had a nice crunch with a soft interior. While the classic banh mi was fine, I didn't care too much for the porchetta banh mi. Vietnamese porchetta is roasted pork with a layer of fat and crispy crackling skin, a traditional Vietnamese pork not typically served on a banh mi. There was a little amount of pork on the sandwich and too much sauce for my taste. It didn't let the pork shine through. I also tried the bulgolgi fries ($5) and those were a meal in themselves. It was shoestring fries with a healthy amount of Korean marinated beef, kimchi, scallions, and cilantro aioli. The Korean flavors were there, and the beef was cooked nicely. I wish there was a little more kimchi and cilantro aioli to add a little more moisture because the fries near the bottom were a little dry, but the fries did maintain their crispiness throughout. Overall, I thought the classic banh mi was decent and the fries were good, but the porchetta banh mi wasn't for me. The prices are a little high for banh mi, but for the area of the store it's still cheaper and a better lunch than you can get from other sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of salt, I need to visit twice more to really solidify my opinion.  There is a lot of bread in this sandwich.  There is also a great deal of variance, sometimes you have a two star time, and others a four star time.  I prefer consistency but consistently bad isn't preferable to occasionally good.  The service is excellent, but in this segment I am more price sensitive than service sensitive.  Any mistakes can be quickly fixed so the service is a plus but the experience isn't impacted as heavily as a serious sit down place would be.  There aren't a lot of other choices in this segment, although I am looking. I like that they are making some bold choices in the menu, but for me those choices didn't pan out very well."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian Banh mi and it was okay until it made me so sick that I ended up throwing up later. The service was also bleh. The lady that was working the cash register had a nasty attitude. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Great banh mi spot, we had great customer service! We ordered the bbq pork & the porchetta banh mi along with pho fries & summer rolls. The food came out pretty quick and everything was delicious! Their Vietnamese coffee is also a great choice. I'd highly recommend for everyone to try them out."}
{"text":"Really good meat and the bun is just right... crispy on the outside and soft in the middle."}
{"text":"Walked in five minutes before closing (didn't realize that at the time). Super nice staff and they offered good suggestions. We got the spring roll, galbi fries, Korean banh mi and boba tea. All were fresh and tasty. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"Very solid offering for a quick meal, and you don't have to fight the potholes in front of Asian Corners to boot (though the parking lots has its own issues).   The menu is definitely interesting, with items such as the porchetta banh mi and the pho tine (reduced pho broth as gravy on fries to mimic a poutine) as well as more traditional grilled pork banh mi. Definitely some solid offerings here, and even with the nice menu, the staff is great and willing to help you through it.  Meal comes out crazy fast, and is eaten up at least as quickly. Definitely going to be somewhere we head back to."}
{"text":"We had a little of everything. Summer rolls and crunchy rolls were both great. Fresh ingredients served with a side of peanut sauce. Crunchy roll in particular was unique and tasty. We also shared an order of galbi fries, basically a version of gravy fries covered with meat and veggies which were awesome. The sandwiches were served on fresh crusty rolls and loaded with veggies. We got the classic, the pho and the Korean. All great, the Korean served with Kim chi. Service was great, the owner obviously puts heart and soul into this place. Everyone was very kind and helpful with describing menu items. Even let us taste the head cheese they make right there in shop. It was really delicious. Keep up the great work! If in the area again we will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Chef/owner has out of this world creativity wish his dishes. Highly Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The lunch options in this area can get pretty repetitive, so I was definitely excited to see a new place. And I was not disappointed!  Right off the bat, we noticed the menu was the perfect size - you have options, but it's not overwhelming and the prices are perfect. There was five of us, so we grabbed a few different banh mi between the lot of us, as well as the pho-tine, Korean fries, seasoned fries, Thai tea with boba, and milk tea with boba. I think we got more than we bargained for!  The banh mi were delicious, on all accounts. I think the porchetta was a group fave. The fries were also a hit!  The pho-tine and Korean fries were one of my favorite parts of the meal just because they were so unique and delicious (and there was enough to feed a small army - we couldn't finish them all). The seasoned fries are perfect for any pickier eaters. A cold milk tea with boba was a satisfying way to wrap up the meal!  I don't get to eat out often, but I'm definitely happy I went out for lunch today. This place gets it right on taste, price, and atmosphere. The kind and helpful staff was a bonus!  I'm pretty sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Try the porchetta it's amazing. Excellent service as well. You can't really go wrong with anything from there"}
{"text":"Since going vegan, we were so pleased to find that the vegetarian options here are largely vegan!  On top of that - tasty!!"}
{"text":"I've grown up on asian sandwiches my whole life. Being Asian myself along with having friends and neighbors of many ethnicities has enabled me to taste the flavorful sandwich in many forms. From a tomato sardine nom pang of Cambodia, the lemongrass pork banh mi of Vietnam or the cold cut Laotian khao jee, they're all delicious. What I haven't tried is the mix of East and West which I finally did here with the porchetta banh mi. The porchetta is a large slab of skin on pork belly that's been marinated in herbs and spices, rolled into a log and roasted. Traditionally an Italian dish. The brothers here roast fresh pork belly every day for the Vietnamese sandwich. One bite and I was in love. The pork chunks were moist and full of flavor. The best part? They roast the meat until the skin becomes crackly and crunchy pork rinds and throw in a couple rinds into the sandwich. Each bite was savory from the pork, tangy from the pickled carrots and daikon, crunchy from the pork rinds, spicy from the jalapeños and to top it all off, the fresh cilantro. Flavor heaven! My son ordered the BBQ pork banh mi and I'm pretty sure he swallowed it whole in record time. He said it was the best banh mi he's ever had - that's saying a lot coming from my picky teenager. We also ordered Tom yum pork rinds. Why? Cause you can never have enough pork for lunch! The pork rinds were covered in a mouth watering sour and spicy salty Tom yum mix, exactly the right flavors that you'd find in the traditional Thai Tom yum soup. The owners are also lovely. They greet you when you walk in and thank you when you leave. Come try this place out. Not only are you getting great food at a reasonable price - you're also supporting a small local business who's appreciative of your patronage."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was so friendly! The owner saw us staring at him while he was cutting the porchetta and brought us over a taste. Between the 3 of us we had the classic, BBQ pork, grilled cured pork banh mi sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and the summer rolls and everything was fantastic! I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a Banh Mi so out came the yelp app to the rescue.  Just finished buying concert tickets at the Pavilion box office so this location was conveniently in close proximity to my current location.  Anyway this was an awesome find and you too will thank your taste buds after eating one of these scrumptious Banh Mi sandwiches.  I ordered and enjoyed not one but two sandwiches, grilled pork and Chinese BBQ pork!  The Mama Doan's Egg Rolls were also pleasantly tasty with some traditional Vietnamese fish sauce for dipping!  This is my new favorite place to buy these wonderful Banh Mi sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Very good addition to the university area.   Summer rolls were awesome and are some of the meatiest I've come across.  The chicken bites were also super yummy.  Tried the Thai tea also and the flavor was just right.  The prices are very reasonable and the is a great spot to get a quick bite for lunch or dinner.  If I were to provide a suggestion - keep eye on tables and cleaning them.  I've been here 3 times and every time there were a number of dirty tables yet to be cleaned after the last customers."}
{"text":"Great food & great staff. They really go the extra mile for customers with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"If i could give it more stars I would!!!! I don't typically like any Korean food that is american-ized like adding Galbi with bread and cilantro or with fries, etc. But man. I got the Galbi fries. Aaaammmmazing. The kimchi was so good too. Highly recommend. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"By far my the best bahn mi I have tried to date.  There's no arguing over it.  My mind as of now is made up.  They have a good variety of sandwiches to choose from. I fell in love with the porchetta at a Yelp event, so rushed over here to order it for lunch. Amazing.  I had my eye on a few other sandwiches for my next visit.  Also some of the appetizers look interesting.  The staff was very friendly. The store is clean and well maintained.   Try this place. The majority of reviews are 4-5 stars...that speaks for itself."}
{"text":"It was good.  Cheap sandwiches, which is what banh mi's should be.  I got the grilled pork banh mi, which had good taste.  I enjoyed the Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  I also got the Galbi Fries.  The toppings were good, but the french fries were the ones you get at a school cafeteria.  They should replace with hand-cut fries."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, will definitely come back. It's a cool and hip little place. We came in after lunch so the place was a bit more calm. We ordered 2 original banh mi, seasoned fries, nem fresh spring rolls and cokes. Honestly, we could have shared just one order of banh mi, that's how much food there was! Crowd that comes in is a mix of business folks and college kids from UNCC. Might be owned by some young folks since there was rap music playing, it didn't feel like a chain but more like a local joint."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for lunch. Not crowded.  I had the classic and she had the pork with lemon grass.  We split an order of fries with steak, kimchi, a few veggies and a wonderful sauce.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently ordered from bang mi brothers and we got the food delivered via grub hub and grub hub dropped off the food but not our drinks, the driver actually had our drinks in the car but drove off with the drinks still in their car. We called Banh Mi Brothers and spoke with a manager and he helped us contact grub hub and get a full refund and concession of 5 additional dollars for our trouble. The Banh Mi Brothers customer service was amazing !!! They helped us quickly remedy the situation and we really appreciate them going above and beyond to help. A1 CustomerService and great food as well!!"}
{"text":"The flavors are pretty good, but the sandwiches are so small for their price. And the place feels a bit stuffy, could use a fan or something."}
{"text":"The banh mi is pretty good. I like the fries a lot as well. I try to get a Viet coffee from there at least once a week so that's also a definite must try."}
{"text":"Found this new place on Yelp.  It was amazing.  The restaurant is bright and clean.  When you walk in they have their gorgeous porchetta on display behind a glass case.  My husband was hooked at one glance.  We ordered the chicken Banh Mi and the porchetta Banh Mi sandwiches.  Both were outstanding!  The vegetables were lightly pickled, the jalapeños and cilantro were fresh and the baguette perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside.  The bites with the fresh jalapeño definitely had a kick to them but were counter balanced by the pickled vegetables.  We also tried the fried chicken chunks (marinated chicken thighs that are fried).  Delicious!  But the menu item that caught our attention and brought us in is the Pho-tine.  Their version of poutine (a Canadian dish made with French fries,  cheese curds covered in gravy).  Banh Mi Brothers has brisket and Pho gravy (yes, you read that correctly) and was nothing short of AMAZING.  The location is so much better than Li's down on Sugar Creek and Tryon and in my opinion the food is far superior also.  I think this place is going to do great!  It's an inexpensive fresh delicious meal close to the college.  Once the word gets out about Banh Mi Brothers I suspect they will be packed all the time.    Kudos and we will be back soon!  Those Pho-Tine fries are going to give me cravings and I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Soooooo goooood!!!!!  The Porchetta is the best Banh Mi I have ever had. They have a great mix of flavors and the dishes are perfectly cooked. We got this on our way out of town and liked it so much that we ordered a second helping for dinner that nice. The Thai Tea and Vietnamanese Coffee were delicious and so smooth. The prices were great. The owner took our order and you could tell that he loves his food and really puts his heart into the place. We will totally be coming back here"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese Bahn Mi sammiches I've had! Tried the fried chicken thighs, Pho Fries and the crispy pork sandwiches and was not disappointed! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the service was AWESOME! Finished the meal with a peach tea  I really hope they keep it up as more people find out about this gem in the university area!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious and affordable banh mi! Each sandwich is only $5. The only thing I would say is maybe add a little more meat. I felt like the sandwich was mainly vegetables with a little bit of meat - maybe that's why it's cheap. I had the pho and grilled pork banh mi, and they were both really good. The baguette was crispy on the outside and the meat was sliced on the spot. I'd come back and try everything else! On a side note, the galbi fries didn't have any galbi in it so they should consider changing the name to bulgogi fries. But it was still yum so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Awesome options. Wish the carrots was spicy though. Other than that it was amazing."}
{"text":"YOU GUYS! You MUST visit Banh Mi Brothers. It is a gem in North Charlotte. I've had banh mi from a couple of places nearby, none were authentic like Banh Mi Brothers. The flavors, incredible. They don't skimp on the toppings of the sandwich, and I KNOW that meat was juicy because I saw them cutting it up. I also got Bubble Tea and it was creamy and delicious.   The decor is clean, simple, and unassuming. They have chalkboard menus with the \"anatomy\" of banh mi which I loved.   The service was great. Not only was the cashier friendly, but she also checked to make sure I liked the bubble tea once she served it to me. They were quick to bring out the food, which I appreciated for a lunch break.   The menu itself was descriptive, and there were plenty of options but not overwhelming. They sure know how to specialize. I'm looking forward to coming back with my husband, tasting some of those incredible-looking fries, and more bubble tea. So excited to see even more diverse food offerings in the area. I was in heaven eating this meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options!  There are 3 vegan Bahn Mi sandwiches to choose from:  seitan, BBQ (soy-based), and 3 mushroom.  The Vegetarian Chay (spring roll) is vegan and GF.  The fries are made in a dedicated fryer so they are vegan as well.  You can get the fries topped with the mushrooms.  They make their own vegan mayo.   These are the best Banh Mi in Charlotte and a great place to go with omnivores.   The Thai tea can be made with soy milk and if you call ahead, they may be able to make the Vietnamese coffee with sweetened condensed soy milk (it is sweet, creamy, strong, and rich.  YUM!).  Fantastic gem of a place with great food and cool place to share a meal."}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open up. Was not disappointed at all! I waited a couple weeks after grand opening to avoid initial frenzy. My plan paid off! These guys provided a tasty quick meal for a very reasonable price. Porchetta and grilled pork bahn mi are excellent! The Kalbi fries were on point and I can't wait to go back for some more Vietnamese Iced Coffee and Pork Rinds. Do yourself a favor and get the CHICKEN CHUNKS! You'll thank me. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Bahn Mi Brothers a couple of weeks ago.   First impression:  very chic, modern, bright,  spacious Vietnamese resto. Staff greeted us with a smile and was accommodating. Very family friendly.   Delicious and perfect Bahn mi sandwiches we've ever had:  classic, Korean,  porchette. Ingredients were fresh and very flavorful.   Decadent and mouth watering fusion French fries: Korean french fries and pho tine French fries.   Appetizers: Tom yum pork rinds and chicken chunks -delish!!!   Their boba and fusion drinks just complemented the sanwiches very well. Our favorites: Thai boba tea,  Mama Doan hangover tea, and Mango smoothie.   This is a must on your to-do list while visiting Charlotte. We will definitely return for another excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Place is legit  The porchetta sandwich was great with cracklings in every bite. Good crusty bread and fillings were solid. Their aioli is delicious   Grilled banh Im was good too.   The Galbi fries didn't last 2 min between the 4 of us. That cilantro aioli is awesome  Summer roll was good. Felt like I got a check mark for veggies there.    Fresh pork rinds came out hot and popping like Rice Krispies.   The owner was super nice. Food came out fast and prices are great.   Happy to be able to find his place here on our way to Florida"}
{"text":"Rode the light rail and walked here!!  Probably a 10min walk from the Mccullough Lynx station, I had not visited the Banh Mi Brothers until now- I'm scratching my head as to why....  I rarely go to the university area ever since I jumped ship from my old job that was located off of Mallard Creek Church, but the area has definitely changed with the light rail opening up.  The store can be a little hard to find if you aren't looking for it, since it's tucked away in a large 2 story complex on the corner of Tryon and WT Harris.  Once you find it and walk in, you walk into a wall of smells (good) and the daunting menu on the right hand side.  The tables are clean and modern with white tile decor... interesting artwork about Banh Mi sandwich construction adorn the walls.  Staff was friendly.  I asked about what they recommended from the menu.  I ended up deciding on the shredded pork, pho-tine fries, and a Vietnamese iced coffee.  It was delicious.  I recommend sharing the fries though... or not, depends on the crowd you are with."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi's for me, Bahn Mi's for you, Bahn Mi's for everyone! That's almost how I feel with how often the Bahn Mi shops are popping up in Charlotte now. But what sets this Bahn Mi shop apart from the rest is their speciality bahn mi's.  Upon entry, they have hip & current music playing. The place is bright and open with a menu on the wall and small menus that you can pick up on the counter.   I wasn't sure what to get but I opted for two of their speciality bahn mi's and boy am I ever so glad that I did. We ordered the Porchetta Bahn Mi (crispy pork belly) and the Korean Bahn Mi and also an order of Crunchy Rolls.   While we waited, I watched them bring out someone's fries and they looked amazing. Kind of kicked myself in the butt for not ordering some but I will definitely be back for those next time.   I watched them make my crispy roll fresh. The girl even remade them because she didn't like how the first ones turned out. Pretty amazing right?  We first tried the Porchetta Bahn Mi and I was like amazed at how good it was right away. The pork belly skin was very crispy, the meat was just juicy and flavorful. And I was surprised at much I really liked the mayo they use. I am not sure what kind of mayo it was but it is definitely more creamy and thick than what we are used to as americans. It really helped the sandwich come together.   As much as I like the Porchetta Bahn Mi, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the Korean Bahn Mi. But the Korean surprised me. It was so good, I mean SOOOOOO GOOD. I opened it and you could see some of the mayo on top so I really wasn't sure but everything on it worked so well the together. The mayo, the kimchi, the marinated beef with the veggies - it all came together and was hands down my favorite.   I promise you I will be back here and be back soon. So glad to see this yummy and delicious spot open in the University area."}
{"text":"The best viet banh mi in charlotte!!!  Love the porchetta banh mi, phi fries, galbi fries and dont forget the tom yum pork rinds. Try the mama doans hangover tea. Full of healthy herbs."}
{"text":"This place looked good for a quick stop. I tried only the jackfruit shake. Ah. A real heaven!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have never had a Banh Mi sandwiches before, but we love ordering things we've never tried before! We stopped by here to try it out! We had the Korean Banh Mi, Pho Fries, and Porchetta, it was all amazing!!! Definitely recommend this spot! We will be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"So glad to have banh mi closer to home. Usually, we venture down to Crispy Banh Mi on South. We each had a bahn mi, an order of fries, a coke and a Thai tea for under $20. The bread they use is right, love the crunch of the veggies and the meat is seasoned enough not to need any more spice. Doesn't mean I didn't douse my sandwich in sriracha and then struggle to breathe afterwards. We'll be back again for sure! If you haven't had Thai tea, it's a delicious, creamy mouth soothing beverage when you're on fire."}
{"text":"Smells great and Excellent & fast service will definitely be back. I ordered Porchetta and pho-tine fries"}
{"text":"Parking lot: can be congested  You can smell the goodness as soon as you walk thru door.  Very clean location with menus written on blackboards.  A few tables to eat at if you chose to dine in.  Cashier and other employees were friendly. They use Uber Eats and Apple Pay I ordered the Pho-time fries (definitely enough for 2 people) and the Chinese BBQ Pork Banh Mi.  Price @$11 The food was fresh, bread toasted, pork tender, fries hot and crispy. If you want to try something different, check this place out."}
{"text":"Best Bahn mi in Charlotte hands down!  The grilled pork bahn mi sandwhich is my go to! The owner is extremely nice as well. Thanks Hao!"}
