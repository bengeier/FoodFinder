{"text":"Everything bad. So bad. A restaurant that doesn't offer milk? Microwaved meals. Slow service. Drinks watered down. It's in the Bermuda Triangle of awful restaurants. And expensive."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago and it was very good. Chips and salsa to start. Margaritas were tasty. Enchiladas and burritos were great.  They had been open about a week or so when we stopped. Could tell they were working out kinks, but we had good service and food. Everything was fresh   We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. As a whole everything was pretty good. We felt the price was a little on the high side but the good service and food made it easier to swallow."}
