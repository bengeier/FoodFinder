{"text":"I love the seafood pho here. It tastes fresh and has a good portion of toppings other than just noodles. The service here is very poor. I have seen them take orders for larger parties before the smaller ones who had been waiting longer. Also, the servers quite frequently forget your orders and you will have to flag and repeat your orders numerous times. I also find it very odd that they seat \"Canadian-looking\" people on one side and Asian ones on the other."}
{"text":"Went to Pho Hung today with some friends hoping to enjoy an authentic Vietnamese meal. Was not disappointed. After finishing most of my XL bowl of Pho, I noticed a small black speck floating in my soup. IT WAS SOME KIND OF INSECT (see picture). I've heard that in Vietnam, food standards differ greatly from ours over here, and that there can be insects and flies and all sorts of crazy stuff crawling on the meat that they sell at outdoor markets. I'm sure sometimes they accidentally wind up in the food as well. So if you are looking for that kind of authentic experience, look no further!
Zero stars for the food / cleanliness / hygeine
1 star for having decently clean bathrooms"}
{"text":"Compared to the last Vietnamese restaurant, this place was a *big* improvement all around!  It was larger, brighter, cleaner, more open and simply decorated in a tropical manner like many other casual Vietnamese restaurants.  It still maintained the same ordering system -- I'm beginning to think this is the way orders are carried out in Canada -- however the service was more efficient and quicker but just as friendly and familiar.

Each bowl or plate was a hearty portion served as hot or fresh as possible.  My individual banh cuon was a mountain of a plate (our table of 13 could have family-styled it if they wanted to).  The ground pork was moderately peppered and given some additional flavor from the sweetened nuoc mam (fish sauce), and what I liked about this nuoc mam was the added fresh hot chili slices giving the sauce a little tang.  Atop these \"Vietnamese crepes,\" lay a tuft of vegetables: bean sprouts, cilantro, carrots, cucumber.  The dish was balanced, and if it had to tip over any direction, it was more refreshing than filling and weighing.
And ca phe sua da?  Well, there's nothing better than strong, French pressed coffee over ice."}
{"text":"Visited Pho Hung for the first time today. This place is definately overrated. Portions were unreasonably tiny. The house special pho consisted of a bowl filled with soup and  1 piece of each type of meat on top of a small portion of noodles. This was the first time I was left still feeling hungry after finished a bowl of pho.

Service itself was average for a pho restaurant. Quick and prompt but not much other than that. 

I will most likely NOT be coming back to pho hung and will be trying out the various other places in the area next time."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot. The bun mam here is very good. I stopped coming back after I was pretty certain I had caught a cold from this place that eventually turned into bronchitis. I suspect it may have been from the re-served garnishes as they did not appear fresh. The place isn't very clean either as I was always successful in finding utensils with dried food stuck on them. 

You probably won't get the best service as I was told the staff is underpaid in cash. They also don't get the tips either - the owner pockets all of it. Don't know if this has changed but I doubt it. I remember coming here with a friend and she asked for a napkin. The waitress gave her one thin napkin. My friend then asked the same waitress 5 minutes later for more napkins. As the waitress handed another ONE napkin to my friend, she stated, \"last one\". We simply could not believe what we just heard. That really should have been my last time at a place like this. Makes me wonder if the staff are given a fixed amount of napkins per shift and if they run out they are whipped in the kitchen later."}
{"text":"Excellent vermicelli bowls! I had the grilled chicken bun and it didn't disappoint. The place was busy but we were seated immediately and served quickly."}
{"text":"I LOVE pho and love to try different restaurants but I tried the pho at Pho Hung and it wasn't great. It was very disappointing as the portions were small for such an expensive price. I honestly don't see why people like this place. The pho is bland and I feel like the broth lacks depth and flavour. I guess when you've had the best, no other places compare. There are definetly better restaurants to get pho."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill.   Used to be good but now food and service dropped in quality.   I ordered the rice with curried grill chicken.   There was no flavour on the chicken. This is not the only time this happened.   As for service, I asked for an extra bowl 2 times from 2 separate servers. Yet they never brought it over even though they acknowledged and it wasn't even that busy at the time. I would recommend going to various other viet places around chinatown."}
{"text":"I have checked in here regularly over the last 6 months. Have ordered a variety of items except for the Pho. The vermicelli dishes, fried rice and spring rolls are delicious. I am looking forward to giving their pho a try next time I am there.

For the price and their fast service, you can't go wrong with Pho Hung."}
{"text":"Around the world reviewing pho.

The broth here is just as good as other decent Vietnamese restaurants.

One of the nicer environments to eat pho. Nice windows all around, you can eat in this sun room type of area. Pretty large restaurant as well."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get pho! Portions are large and everything is always fresh and delicious!! Love it here."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. It used to be one of the best pho in the city. But having been away two years, I return to find that the quality definitely has decline. At first I thought they have changed owner, but seeing the original owner (now much older) working ruled out change of ownership. The broth is tasteless and watery, with the meat being someone rubbery. They use to have a transparent noodle dish with seafood. Now only with rice or wonton noodle which was my favorite, is just plain horrid. Say to see they let success affect their food quality. SMH. SO SAD!!!"}
{"text":"Went based on positive Yelp reviews, should have paid attention to the negative ones. Terrible, rude service from everyone but the owner, sub par food. I ordered spring rolls to start and was served fried rolls. I had hoped for a better experience with my rare beef and beef ball soup. Beef balls were rubbery, soup broth was harsh and unappetizing. Friends all received the exact same order when they clearly ordered different dishes. We also had an order of spicy wings that were a hair above pub fare. Not a good soup house, let alone Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"We are staying in an apartment in Kesington market area for our 1st visit to Toronto. After a long day of walking/sightseeing, we were looking for something quick and nearby. We stumbled upon this pho place and since it was packed, we decided to try it.

I always looked at yelp prior to going to a restaurant but this time, I didn't due to not having wifi. What a big mistake!

When we first walked in, they directed us to a table then nothing... We waiting around to have someone to take our orders for at least 10 min. I finally flagged someone and she was like \"u need to fill out an order form\"... Well thanks but we didn't know. So we proceeded to find the different numbers for each item and fill the order form which happens to also be the bill. Waited another 5-10 min to have someone pick that piece of paper.

Pho was just ok. Nothing special. I usually have a hard time finishing large pho in California and go for a smaller bowl but today I was hungry (probably from walking 13 miles around the city) so I went for the large bowl which seemed big with the bowl but not content. 

During our meal, no one came to check on us or give us more tea and we had to flag two different people before being able to get our bill.

Worse service ever. I feel I just wasted one of my few meals while in Toronto. Sigh. :("}
{"text":"Soup is filled with MSG. Service is quick and fuss free."}
{"text":"Very clean, spotless, you don't see just Asians in this place, food comes out fast, extremely well done pho, we ordered the house special which has everything in it. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good pho, but I'm too much of a fan of pho and the general area of K-mart/Chinatown to not state that my review will be biased. No disagreements with anything, broth is very tasty, noodles and meats are as expected. Very cheap and filling food (pho in general)."}
{"text":"This place recently had a \"makeover\" of their servings. Meaning? Everything was scaled down. The bf and I have been pretty regular customers, I always get a small \"special\" pho soup with everything, and he always gets the same large vermicelli bowl. The last time I went there, for the first time ever, the small soup was not filling enough. I guess I should have ordered a large, but the large would have for sure been too large... bahhh. Oh and the \"large\" vermicelli bowl would definitely not feed an average sized adult who is hungry. This did not used to be the case.

Service is ok. They're usually pretty fast. There's an interesting lady manning the cash, who seems to be the owner. One time we got takeout from there, and instead of asking us to wait outside, she asked something like \"where are you going to be in 10 minutes\", when we replied \"we are going to wait here (signalling at an empty table), she gave us the BITCHIEST SNIDE EYE I have seen, THEN proceeded to roll her eyes, and looked away, mumbling something I didn't quite understand. I guess our response was really offensive to her, but if she didn't want us to wait, why couldn't she have said \"there's not enough room, please come back in 10 minutes\"? Was the cut eye really necessary? Nope. We decided to leave, as our presence clearly offended her, and when we came back and paid for the meal, she actually squeezed out a fake smile and said \"thank you, come again\"... Bizarre!

Anyway, long story short, pretty authentic food, good prices.  I just wish they didn't cheap out the serving sizes.  For exactly the same thing but larger serving portions, go to Xe Lua down the street (1 block south of Dundas).

oh and like the reviewer before me, I totally noticed the stolen logo from La Vache qui rit (did i spell that right? I meant to write \"the laughing cow\" in French). I wonder if the cheesemakers will slap pho hung with a suit?"}
{"text":"I can write a whole book on how horrible this place was, I'm not even going to rate it bc it should get a negative amount of stars! SMH SMH SMH!!!! The SERVICE was horrifying, scratch that there was no mentionable service & the food was terrible, I'm literally waiting to get food poisoning. They even had diluted hoisin sauce... , honestly hunger is the best seasoning without it I probably couldn't swallow a bite. There's a hella lot of msg and tbh it's probably their best move. I usually don't write reviews but this place is so bad I have to do this act of service and save y'all. I have so much complaints and if I continue my thumb might cramp. All in all 11/10 would not recommend.  BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD save your money!!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me so our party of 4 decided to try this place out for lunch. We had a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon and upon walking in, we were surprised that the restaurant was still crowded. 

I ordered:

the shrimp spring roll appetizer (not very tasty, the peanut sauce was below par)

The vermicelli with  bbq pork sausage with egg rolls (this dish was really good)

I like how this restaurant has a small/large portion option for alot of their entrees because many typical Vietnamese joints only offer small/large portions for their pho items.

**One thing that bugged me was that they gave me a sriracha bottle filled with fish sauce to pour into my bowl of vermincelli. You have to be careful with that bottle because if you apply too much pressure, the fish sauce will spill all over. They should've just gave me a small bowl of the fish sauce dipping sauce. My clothes smelled like sh*t afterwards"}
{"text":"Horrible... Wouldn't let us share a single entree. Told us that if we shared, they would charge us 6 dollars. The soup based of the pho wasn't good. In addition the waiter wasn't very bright."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Consistent quality of Pho, average service. I know what to expect every time I visit. Strangely I also know the short mustached owner who also owns the closed Pho Hung at the Annex (lease ended) and the restaurant in Mississauga. Probably my choice for Pho if i'm ever in the Chinatown area. Always this place over Pho Pasteur, always.

Food: 4
Service: 4
Ambience: 4
Overall: 4 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Very good dac biet pho and fried spring rolls.  Summer rolls were a bit chewy for my liking.  The pho broth is a highlight!"}
{"text":"If I could I would take the  one and only star away !! I've been coming to this place ever since I moved to mississauga 5 yrs ago and have told many people of the little hidden Gem only to have my wife and two sister in-laws come back to me with great disappointment on the way they were treated in this place IF IT's To much To Ask For limes and Brussels sprouts then tell your customers at the door don't ignore them worst thing you can do to paying customer 1- lie 2-ignore , just another resturant that got to big for its own good.

Merry Christmas !! 
Everyone."}
{"text":"Terrible. Would give 0 if possible. They kept getting our orders wrong. We order Pork, they give us Beef. We specified on paper, and told them verbally no bean sprouts in the order, and low and behold, the dish comes out in bean sprouts. These would be minor problems, and no one really ever goes to Chinatown and expects exceptional service, but here's the kicker, they came out with two EXTRA dishes that we didn't order. The Manager was really upset at us when we tried returning those dishes, he stormed to the back and brought our order receipt to prove us wrong. When he brought it to us, he looked at it and said \"oh\" and left without apologizing. Clearly whoever placed the order read it wrong and caused a mix up in the kitchen.

Now I remember why it has been over 20 years since the last time I went and couldn't remember why I never returned. Well thank you Pho Hung for bringing back the recollection.

Other than that, the food was good. But because of the service, the food wasn't good enough for me to ever return. That's just too bad since I see that this place has high ratings. Désolé"}
{"text":"The #3 and #4 were pretty lackluster. The broth was lifeless and required Sriracha to have some flavor. Meat was good and the tea was a nice touch but overall, not anything to write home about. They also scammed us a few bucks by using a bogus conversion rate from cad to usd since and wouldn't accept credit. The food is only decent but beware if you only have US cash on you."}
{"text":"This is a busy restaurant on Spadina just outside of Kensington. My friend and I visit Pho Hung from time to time when craving some Vietnamese cuisine. There are a couple of dishes we always rotate ... fried frog legs.... rare beef with lemon juice (this is spicy!! we usually avoid the tiny pieces of chillies) .... and other staples such as a bun/vermicelli or a rice dish. I'm not thrilled with the pho here so I'll go elsewhere when I want some pho. 
Service is simple and efficient. You should order everything you want all at once as it may prove difficult to flag down servers after initial contact. Turnover is quick, so even if there's a big queue for tables, it will pass quickly. This is not a place to linger at leisure.
I always have to remember to bring cash with me as they don't accept any other types of payments. This is slightly annoying as I generally use credit/debit everywhere."}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm always surprised when I pass Pho Hung and find it overflowing with more patrons than all other Pho restaurants in the vicinity combined.  I found both their pho and bun offerings to be perfectly serviceable but not noticeably better than any other Vietnamese restaurant along Spadina (and certainly not worth the extra premium you pay).  For the same price you can get fancier dining at Pho 88.  For more adventurous and authentic fare e.g. blood sausages, pop over to Xe Lua."}
{"text":"Pho was delicious. I got an XL and it was very filling. Also had some deep fried egg rolls which I wasn't crazy about but they weren't terrible either. My friend had wings with his Pho and they looked excellent. I'll probably try them next time. My rolls plus XL pho came to around 20$ with a tip, good bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"Pho Hung is a super quick meal and it's cheap and decent. Usually cheap and quick in Chinatown means dirty, but it's a pleasant, clean experience. This is the kind of Vietnamese joint you can take Vietnamese friends to as well as students and American tourists alike. And you don't hear that often.

Also, lots of great vegetarian options that don't taste like cardboard or compressed dust.

And if you like coffee, Vietnamese coffee is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I travel alot and have tried Pho in many city.  Knowing that the Toronto has pretty high standards for food and for Asian food in particular. I was up to get some Mo' Pho.  Doing a little research I found two restaurants in the Missisauga area Pho Mi 99 which was close and under new management and Pho Hung.

I tried my usual Pho Ga and some Vietnamese Coffee.  Both where great.  The service was quick and friendly.  And even though I did not believe the other reviewer about the cleanliness of the restaurant because of pass experiences in Pho restaurants. IT WAS VERY CLEAN.  WOW!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pho and best com tam!

Service is sometimes slow and this place gets packed at lunch time.

Still, this is the best Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple more times for various dishes, avoiding the beef pho each time.
I've ordered their vermicelli, rice dishes, and some of their other noodle dishes, each time with the vegetarian spring rolls.
The place has definitely grown on me, especially when I crave something quick (food arrives quickly and rarely a line), hearty, and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Hung a number of times and really enjoy it. I'm not going to get into the whole \"Best Pho in the GTA\" debate, as I think it's really subject to personal taste. What I can tell you is that this place hits all of the main criteria that i look for: Good lively atmosphere, decent service, reasonable prices, AND, most importantly, great food! I would certainly give it a 3.5 rating.
It was a wet and overcast day in T.O., and provided perfect conditions for Pho after an afternoon at the AGO!
We had 2 LG Pho, and 2 Vietnamese hot coffees. The food arrived VERY fast, and it was excellent! The Pho hit the spot, and, as I write this review, I think I'm still wired from the coffee! lol  Price for everything was $22.
Try Pho Hung if you're in the Dundas/Spadina area and need a Pho fix...you won't be disappointed! Even local Pho Snobs will find something here to satisfy their taste buds!"}
{"text":"Pho Hung (on Dundas in Mississauga) is the place to go for pho. There are a lot of places that offer Vietnamese food / pho - including their other branches, but this Pho Hung offers the best variety, price and cleanliness. 
When visiting, I normally shuffle between the pho with raw beef brisket and tendon, the Special Fried Rice and the chicken/pork chop rice. 
What I love about their pho is that each element is served fresh - the noodles, broth, meat and side veg. I add a little bit of the sembal sauce just to give it a little kick.  The broth is very tasty but not heavy. It's not salty. It's just there to bring the whole thing together. 
The staff is not chatty. They'll come to give you the menu and tea, take your order, serve your order and basically leave you alone unless you need something else. Is this a bad thing? Not at all. It's just what I expect in a place like this. 
This branch is better than their downtown locations because it's much cleaner and less crowded. They also have better access to parking. 
BTW, their crispy chicken wings is a must try. These babies can easily beat the wings of a lot of dedicated wings place out there - in Canada or the US."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average, I will give them this, the broth taste pretty full. However, there is a large amount of oil you'll be able to notice so it's definitely not the healthiest and tastiest bowl of pho you can find. 

I ordered the beef and the brisket, and the brisket doesn't taste as fresh as other places I have tried, (I'll write reviews for them another time) but overall it's not too bad but not too great. It's a good place for groups and family.  

I also ordered the cold shrimp rolls, and those are pretty average as well. 

I'd hate to say that I don't have anything stellar to say about this restaurant but it's true.

In the area of Chinatown however, there are only a select few places for pho and I think that pho hung has taken the top spot on the list. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular not anymore

Not sure when this took effect but the whole 1 napkin per person just irritates me as well as the service, I am here to order my food, eat, pay and leave I do not need attitude with it

The last time I was there I simply asked for cook bean sprouts, so this bitchy waitress tells me \"you want cook bean sprouts, you ask!\" well isn't that what I said in the first place?"}
{"text":"Had the pho here. The broth is less saltier and sweeter than other pho places, and even the colour of the broth is lighter, which means less artificial flavouring (I think). They give you a generous amount of meat. 

I like the gentler taste the broth has compared to other places. That does not mean that it tastes watered down.

Their noodles were a bit overcooked, though."}
{"text":"Excellent bun bo hue spicy noodles. Very flavorful and comes with a generous portion of beef. Durian milkshake, made with real fruit is also delicious. Menu is extensive, will definitely come again to try other things."}
{"text":"- Quality of food: pretty poor compared to Pho Xe Lua. the soup is literally light and not meaty. 

- Quality of service: well, waiter and waitress are friendly and they serve customers well. However, the most annoying thing is the girl sitting behind the cashier desk. I tried to make a conversation with her in her language, but she just responded very short with a straight face. I'm sure I did smile with her but... I'm pretty disappointed with that."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually get the rare beef pho. The food is reasonably-priced and the service is fast."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 bowls of beef ball noodle soup and deep fried egg rolls.  The eggs rolls were OK, nothing out of the ordinary.  The broth did not have very strong beef flavor and not very tasty."}
{"text":"Just perfect if you are looking for some good comfort food. Cooked stuff are tasty and delicious, while the greens fresh and crunchy. This place really doesn't need another review, it is lively even at 3pm on a weekday"}
{"text":"Several websites had mentioned that this restaurant was one of the best Pho spots in Toronto. While visiting, it was within walking distance of our hostel. We were seated quite quickly and was surprised that there were S, L and XL pho options. Both my boyfriend and I ordered the #1, I ordered the large, while my boyfriend ordered the XL bowl. The XL bowl is priced at 9 CAD, which is about the standard price for a large sized bowl in NYC. 

When the XL bowl arrived, I was amazed. It was gigantic! The broth was delicious and the servings were decent, although there was a lot more noodles then I would have preferred. 

On our last day in Toronto with only about 10 CAD each to spare, we headed back here and it was also, a good experience, but a lot more crowded. 

The seating is pretty packed, but if you're looking for a quick and tasty bite to eat, check out Pho Hung."}
{"text":"Solid, cheap, Vietnamese food in a convenient location. I usually get the chicken noodle soup (pho). The chicken is quality, white meat, not the \"crappy scrappies\" so often found in soup dishes."}
{"text":"I know there is no shortage of reviews of Pho Hung.  I notice a polarization in reviews, with some written from the perspective of those looking for authentic Vietnamese, and others written by newbies looking for there first experience with Viet cuisine. Pre-dating my last relationship with a French-Viet girl, I was one of those newbies.  However, hundreds of authentic home-cooked vietnamese meals later, I can honestly say I still love Pho Hung.  But here's the thing, I love Pho Hung for what it is.  It's not the place to go for the most authentic home-cooked Viet dishes.  But if you love chicken wings as I do, it's a little known secret that this place is home to some of the best wings in the city.  Yes!  I kid you not.  Go to Pho Hung, order a large number 60, with a Corona and enjoy the biggest, crispiest, and most flavorful chicken wings you've ever had.  Be warned that these are fried wings, and I by no means suggest them if you're on the mend from a recent by-pass, or on your way to one.  However, if you're craving some good old-fashioned stick-to-your-ribs comfort food, try these wings.  They will not disappoint.  Let me know what you think."}
{"text":"I know this is a popular restaurant with good food. But really, their service is terrible. You have to wait around awkardly for 5 minutes until being seated. Me and my bf ordered pho and their famous 19A; my food didn't come until my bf finished his pho. When I asked one of the waitresses what's going on my order, instead of being apologetic  she literally threw the dish on the table when the food finally came."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Viet place with all the usual suspects on the menu.  Good enough, but nothing to write home about and there are many better places in the city."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Seated quickly. We need to write down what you want, as the server don't take order for you, strange. I ordered grilled chicken with noodle soup. The waitress said they don't have it on the menu but can order it off menu and will be about $4-5 dollars for the chicken plus $7 just for the noodle soup. At the end, they charged me $11 for a small piece of deep fried chicken. So it costs me $18 for the order. Way too expensive and the taste was average. Customer service was bad. I don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"I have had pho all over the city. This place has a good reputation for no reason. My broth has been luke warm so many times that I have just decided to not risk spending money on it, ever again. And cash only is annoying.  Even if it is only $6, the broth should be piping hot. Save your shekels and go down to 221 Spadina to Ai may for pho. Its slightly cheaper and always perfect."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and heard about their famous Chinatown, so headed over in search of authentic Vietnamese cuisine.

Through Yelp, I found this restaurant.  The fact that they were mentioned in Zagats sealed the deal for me. I'm a big fan of Bun Rieu, a dish that seems to be very hard to find.  Pho Hung happened to have this dish and so I was very excited to order it.

Overall, this dish was very satisfactory.  It was extremely busy when I went (around 12:30 pm on a weekday), so they must be doing something right.

Would I go there again next time I'm in town? Probably not. Would most likely try other places."}
{"text":"Delicious food at unbelievable prices.  The pho is great, but if soup isn't enough to fill you up, they have really good rice dishes that are guaranteed to do the job (trust me).

It's generally busy in there and a little crowded, but certainly not uncomfortable.  If you need a little more space and a less frenetic pace, try the location on Bloor.  Basically the same menu and you can get a nice window table overlooking Bloor street.  Very nice."}
{"text":"One of our favourite things to do is try Beef Stew Pho at any place that has it... And here is definitely the best. We have gone far out of our way to get this beef stew because it's so amazing. The meat and carrots are so tasty and tender - it's obvious it's been stewing for hours. We also tried the shredded pork fresh rolls, and they were so amazing and fresh (haha) as well. 
This place is always so busy, and it's obvious why!"}
{"text":"The food is good, especially for remedy-ing a hangover. I have never eaten in, but I have taken out a good fifty times, as I used to live accross the street. 

Despite the reliably good pho, the service is AWFUL. Likely the reason I have never been anxious to sit down and commit an hour to being treated badly by somebody I'm supposed to leave a tip for. But really, they seem absolutely PISSED OFF anytime you order something. And about 25 of the fifty times, they would forget an item in my bag, whether it be fish sauce, rooster sauce, the drinks, whatever, and I'd have to come back. When they did finally get me the right item, it was with a huge harrumph and a glare. Never a sorry. Like they expect ME to be sorry for expecting to get everything I paid for. URGH

Luckily my anger is always tamed by the heart-warming pho and the huge portions. Cheap prices help too. I cannot lie, visit number 51 will probably happen soon."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic--I can never find pho this good in NYC. It's also fairly cheap. There is almost no service--you write the order down yourself on the pad that's already on the table, and they just take it to the kitchen. Then you pay the bill at the front on your way out.

I am taking off two stars because they failed to bring us one of the items we ordered--even though we asked them to, TWICE. So, good food, but no service to speak of."}
{"text":"I used to to to this place when i first moved to Toronto years ago before they built the addition. Back then, the quality of the food was top notch and the owner actually still worked in the shop.  There are still pictures of him with the fishes that he catches. He reminds me of my dad who also has alot of pics with him and fish that he catches.

Nowadays, the services is being provided by young kids who don't seem to be very switf and savvy. We had to ask for our bill 3 times and waited for half an hour before the bill finally came.

The pho itself was good.  No complaints. Ingredients were fresh and tasty. Broth is hot and adequate - not what it used to be but ok. 

We also ordered the spring roll which was ok as well.

The ambiance and cleanliness leaves alot to be desired, however being in Chinatown, you sort of can't really expect anything more.

Prices are decent...around $6.50 for a large bowl."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard of this place with great food so we checked it out. The food was awesome and we planned on going back that weekend. We didn't know they only accepted cash. We had enough to pay for our meal and that was it. We planned on coming back and leaving a really nice tip the second time but we didn't even go back because the guy who took our money said oh only 51 cents! He kept repeating it so loud over and over to embarrass us in front of the other guests!  I will not only NEVER go back I will never recommend it to any of my friends as there are too many other places in the city that have great Vietnamese food and much nicer staff!!"}
{"text":"Every time I went to Chinatown I hit this one spot up, but I was looking for a change and was trying to woo a friend who claims to have had phenomenal pho back in Vancouver. I searched through Yelp and Urbanspoon for a few days and found that this place had the best/most consistent reviews. So the day came and we ventured down to Spadina to eat. It was on a Thursday evening, so it wasn't very busy. We both just ordered some standard pho with beef. It was very good, maybe a little bit too salty for my liking but I grew up with a very unsalted palette. I would recommend people to try this place out for sure and as Vietnamese person (who's mother and grandmother make the best pho ever) I approve of this quality. The only downside is that they are cash only.

Extra: The ambience felt very legit and loved the windows (if you can get a seat by the side windows, do it - it's nice)"}
{"text":"This is the default Vietnamese restaurant, the true-blue, the one that always comes through when you have nothing else or when you want to know what you're going for.  The place is usually busy and got so popular they had to open up an atrium bit a few years back.  With the high turn-over, you know that you'll be getting fresh food.

You get a menu and a bill to write down your order.  The servers come, take it away, bring your food, and that's it -- no hassles, no small talk.  I normally go for a Vietnamese salad (#54) with just tofu and no peppers.  The salad comes with fresh shrimp chips.  You load up the shrimp chips and eat.  Also, for folks who always order the deep fried spring rolls, try the fresh ones.  There is the usual shredded pork or the shrimp rolls and bode for a healthier option to the deep fried ones.  Of course there is the regular pho (noodle soup), bun (rice noodles), and con (rice).  Mmmm, Vietnamese!"}

{"text":"Its not like the pho served here is any different from gazillion other places which serve pho in china town. Yet its super busy all the time esp Friday afternoons for lunch.

Had a large pho with tendons and brisket and it was yum. Sadly for my friend there was a long and agonizing wait of 10 mins after everyone received their meals as the server forgot to pass her order to the kitchen.

However when it arrived it was worth the wait."}

My favorite: lean beef noodle soup.
Pretty cheap, always fresh and great value for your money :)"}
{"text":"If Pho 88 or Peach Garden down the street still exists, I would never come here.

- Pho is too soft
- Soup not hot enough
- Portion size between M, L, XL hardly noticeable, you get bigger bowl, more soup
- Bad service, I mean extremely bad
- Overpriced
- Very crowded, they put too many tables into the small space

Positive
- Can't think of any"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a go-to place when I want to have a noodle. Food is really good and authentic, price is cheap and service is quick.
04 (Rare with Fatty Brisket) is my favorite dish and it comes with sprout and mint leaves.
One downside is they accept only cash."}

The lady i believe the owner asked about my child age and then she gave us the bill even before we finished our meals . I guessed she did'nt want my child to be in her restaurant . What the phuck !
Very very bad service . We 've never come to eat there since ."}

I think the cook/owner changed.I will never visit this place again."}

I would not go again, not worth!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever here on last 3 visits.  I was a loyal customer when they were on Bloor, and the service was way better, but it seems their attitude has been influenced by the Soup Nazi.  Unlike him tho, their fare is mediocre at best.  Many more options of much better quality in this city.  I won't be back, especially after the owner was the one dishing out the attitude tonight.  No wonder his staff are so miserable."}

You will get more service from the owner if you're a white business man. 
Cash only"}
{"text":"Great good but the actual place is a dive. Cash only. That sucks.  Food makes up for it."}
{"text":"The food was wicked good.  The pho broth was probably the best I've ever had - very flavorful!

My sister got the grilled beef with spring roll vermicelli, which also packed a heck-uv-alot of flavor!  

The vermicelli also came with a BOTTLE of fish sauce (Boston gives a little side dish and you gotta ask for more).

Would've been 5-stars but they were a bit slow they were wicked cheap with the napkins.  I'm a messy @$$ eater."}
{"text":"tl:dr Average food and pricing, terrible service, cash only.

This was my go to place for Pho but the terrible service has made it such a turn off. I've been here about a dozen and a half times now and pretty much each time, their service has made my visit a disappointment. Why do I keep coming back? Their location is convenient and I'm a busy man. The attitude of most of the service staff is just horrible. For instance, I visited this place during a quiet Thursday night when the place was pretty empty. I requested for a window seat in a quiet corner of the restaurant and all I got was an annoyed look from the waitress. She set me up and left. I then had to wait 10 mins just for the menu and after asking 3 servers for my tea, I had given up. I was asked (rather rudely) twice to move so that they could 'clean up' the section. But shortly after I had moved, they had seated new customers at that table. Also, the restaurant says they close at 10pm but they start packing up the place at 8.30pm. 

If they had better service, I'd probably give this place 4 stars. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this place if all you're looking for is some decent Pho."}

Nostalgia- forget about it

{"text":"AMAZING NOODLES.

Go a little earlier (before lunch or dinner time) to get seats. There are always loooooonnnnnggggg line ups!

EDIT:

Someone asked me to share what I ordered. Every time I go, I usually just get Pho. I don't exactly remember the name (Sorry!), but it should be the first one on the Pho page! I'll check again next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large vermicelli bowl with shrimp and spring rolls for $14 total including tax. Not too bad. Love the unlimited siracha, hoisin, and that clear watery stuff you throw in the bowl. Notice the picture, how I drenched the bowl with said sauces. It did not come like this. It's my own doing...

Hate it when restaurants are stingy on sauce. Anyway, the food was good, filling, and service was super quick and friendly. Think this might be my new Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"I have tried pho soup in probably 20 different places in toronto. This place probably one of the best of them. My favourite dish is rare beef pho soup(number 02 on the menu) and shrimp roll(number 63 on the menuLove the hot fresh chilies on the side of the tables. My only complain would be meat amount in soups is little less than other places. But the quality of the food makes me forget about it."}
{"text":"After a bit of a hiatus, I was reminded the other day of how fantastic Pho Hung actually is.

We ordered Mango Milkshakes and variations on the noodle salad dish \"Bun\". I think they are one of the few Viet restaurants that actually use fresh mango in their drinks. None of that tinned Mango Pulp madness that just makes you want to gag.

The Bun was excellent. They place a huge squeeze bottle of Nuoc Cham (Dipping Sauce) on the table, and you can squirt away to your liking. Not like other places, where you have to beg for another small bowl.

I had #16 with Pork Skin, Pork Sausage, Grilled Pork, and a Spring Roll. Totally #NOM worthy. 

This place is much better than Golden Turtle."}
{"text":"What ever happened to Pho Hung?  This only mighty staple has now become the TTC of vietnamese restaurants.  Prices keep going up, service still awful.  The food is not much better.  The only good thing about the place is the stuffed muskie on the wall.  

So I just got back from lunch.  Ordered the 01 Special.  The beef, tripe and tendon was actually good this time around but the broth is still sub-par.   Much better pho is available further south on Spadina on the other side of Dundas.  The bean sprouts again were not fresh, some were completely brown rotten.  Disgusting.  Did the server even give a $hit?  No way.  

Asking for napkins was a serious chore.  Seriously, can you just provide even one napkin at the tables without making me wait ten minutes for when you are good and ready?  I also didn't appreciate having all my change thrown right into the tip jar.  Next time I'll just grab my change out of the tip jar including the tip, but thankfully that won't be a problem anymore because I'm never coming back.  

So long!"}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea if I'm just unlucky but I received horrible service here, contrary to basically all the reviews? I agree entirely with Kanwar S. the food here is pretty okay but the horrible service just took away from the entire meal.  I came here for lunch with a male friend of mine.  He ordered a small pho, while I ordered a medium pho.  Thinking back, my experience here was extremely similar to a grocery market.  The woman server brought out both our food, and very rudely propped down the medium bowl to my male friend, and me the small bowl.  I guess it's just the mentality that women eat less than men, but we did notify her of the mistake, and without apologizing, she shoved the bowls around.  
Putting this aside, we both finished the average tasting Pho in 20 minutes, and were chatting for no longer than 10 minutes, when the server took the initiative to give us our bill without us requesting it.  Gee... thanks for the invitation for us to leave the restaurant... I am Vietnamese, and I was sure to notify her of her quite courteous behaviour.  Just gave me another reason to go to the Pho Dau Bo a few blocks away."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 15 years, it's my gold standard for Vietnamese food. Seeing the same family running the restaurant for as long as it's been open is heartwarming. The food is delicious, fast and affordable."}
{"text":"The pho here always makes me superrrrrr thirsty for hours after consumption, so I suspect tonnes of sodium to be the culprit in the form of MSG, since taste wise it is not  exceptionally salty to warrant such a physiological response.

Taste wise, it is alright, the broth is a bit more watery than my preferred places (Xe lua on Gerrad or Pho Tein Thanh on Ossington), but still flavorful. The portions are not extremely large compared to other Pho places in Toronto, if I am normal hungry, it will full me, but if I am super hungry, it wouldn't.

The place is generally clean, service is no frills but effective most times except during peak hours (which is understandable to me for this type of establishment).

Overall, not a place I would go out of my way for, but if I am around the area and hungry I will drop it."}
{"text":"Okay so it's not exactly service with a smile but the pho really is delicious.  I get the chicken pho and my husband gets the beef pho.  My broth is so clear and clean it always hits the spot.  Also the fried spring rolls are a must order.  Probably the best Vietnamese spring rolls I've ever had.  

Once I got all adventurous and ordered the banh xeo which is like a crepe filled with a shrimp mixture and veggies.  I've had it at other Vietnamese restaurants and was looking forward to their interpretation of it.  Sadly it was very full of bean sprouts instead of shrimp and the taste of the crepe itself wasn't as savoury as I had hoped.  Still good but not great.

Will keep going back when in the neighborhood and will keep trying new things on the menu until I find that perfect secret menu gem!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for over a decade. The food is very consistent and tasty. Also its very affordable. The staff it not friendly or overly helpful, they just take the piece of paper with your order, bring you the food, the bill and then clean the table for the next customer. No chit chat, no checking in to see if you need more tea or water. But what they do, they do it fast and efficiently. When I go to this place I already know what I want, I am in and out fast and satisfied every time."}
{"text":"A busy spot in Chinatown/Kensington Market area.  Pho Hung is one of better Vietnamese joint in this area.  I used to frequent it a while back, and the only thing worth mentioning is their pho.  It serves sufficient portion with good cut of meat.  The broth is satisfactory, temperature not very hot.  It's not the best, but it does the job.  The appetizers are dispensable, had tried their spring roll, banh cuon and rice dish in the past, but none of those is impressive.  I'll only visit here if they are not too busy, coz if they are busy they always arrange me to sit with stranger.  They hire so many waiters so service is efficient and turnover is fast.  Price is average."}
{"text":"This place serves bomb pho. If you're a pho purist with a sophisticated palate then you might state otherwise. For me, Pho Hung (pho + Vietnamese iced coffee) always hits the spot. Servers are nice, probably just overworked since they're always bustling. Will keep coming back to this place for pho and no other."}

The portions are huge and you get exactly what you pay for if not more. A must try."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite downtown pho joint. I ordered the spring rolls and my usual pho special with beef, tendon, tripe and beef balls. The pho was served piping hot, which was perfect for today's chilly spring weather. Portions are very good for the price ($7 for a \"small\" bowl). As a person who can't eat a meal without some spice, I love that they provide a small bowl of chillies on the table. 

The service was also quite good and consistent; food served quickly, friendly enough staff. I don't go there expecting them to have a full-on conversation with me. I should note that accommodations were made for my pregnant friends to ensure that the beef was well done and bean sprouts cooked. That was much appreciated. 

Yeah, the restaurant doesn't look the best, but it's Chinatown so you have to lower your expectations accordingly. Besides, it's kind of charming in an odd way. 

Check it out if you happen to be in Chi-town~"}
{"text":"Ok not what I was expecting. The pho/broth was ok. My rare beef was all clumped together and very difficult to separate. It was also not the most tender beef I've ever had. Meatballs were different. Overcooked and kind of tasteless. Had the vegetable rolls. Arrived soaked in oil. Tasty if you can get past the amount of oil used. My favorite part of the meal was my mango milk shake. Will I return/hell no not unless someone makes me and I have to fake I'm loving it like all the ppl who wrote great reviews about this place. Lastly there's a gross smelling homeless guy the staff allow to solicit for money. Really that alone is a reason to stay away."}

{"text":"WORST FOOD IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!! And I'm just talking food here..... Don't get me started on the restaurant itself.  This place is chunky. The vermicelli noodles are the worst I've eaten IN MY LIFE. let me tell you, I've eaten at quite a few pho places in my 60 years of life, and this place is by far the WORST! Chinatown itself is DISGUSTING,!!!! Clean up someone will you? Toronto isn't bad, but Chinatown is outrageously DIRTY!  The bad experience started when the noodles came and the waiting staff told me there were no more bean sprouts, and a couple minutes later the table next to me had them! What the heck man! The place makes the broth to feed the masses. Absolutely NO FLAVOR!!!. It's missing the pho taste.  Then, to make the time there even worse, a hobo came in and started asking every table for money! The manager didn't even stop him. This is a private restaurant, NOT A MCDONALDS!! My children were TRAUMATIZED by the man.   HE WAS ATROCIOUS!  TWO HOBOS CAME IN!!!!!!  Not one, but TWO! Customers were being HARASSED!  The beef was terrible.  The meat spring rolls weren't even meat! They were some kind of gluten and weird vegetables.  this place is for people who have no taste.  take my advice : NO ONE EAT HERE. IT WILL SAVE YOU SOME MONEY AND A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  The manager was terrible and so was the staff.  Overall, I would rate this place a -100 on a 1 to 1000 scale!"}
{"text":"Food was good,  service was terrible! 

Ordered extra large bowl of noodles ($9.00) to shared with my wife, like we normally do at other Vietnamese restaurants. Waitress came by picked up the order, only to come back a minute later to tell us we either need to order 2 small bowls, pay $4.00 extra if we want to share the extra large bowl! Or order their spring rolls for $4.70 and the sharing fee will be waived. We took the spring rolls. 

The waiter came with the order a few minutes later, but it was not an extra large order, had to tell him we ordered extra large. Came back with the extra large order, but no sprouts. Waited for them, never came, had to flag the waiter down and ask for them. 

Needless to say my wife and I is never coming back to this place, even though the foods tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"Ick. The service is very poor, which in itself would be forgivable, if the restaurant itself were not so grungy. The cleanliness does not inspire much confidence in the food. Try to sit near the window so at least you get a bit of natural light and look outside.

The pho itself was nothing to write home about. Broth was generic and lacking the sweet and savoury combo of star anise, onion, ginger, etc.

I have to believe that there are better options in Chinatown.

On the plus side, I liked that they had a small-sized option for the pho and that they were generous with the bean sprouts."}
{"text":"One of the better pho joints in the city. Very fresh, flavourful and large portions. Service is also great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our first date here 3 years ago and the food was awesome. We've probably went here more than 60 times and every time we've went this past year, the service and food has been terrible. I don't know if management has changed or the people that work there just don't care anymore, but nothing seems to be right anymore. 

- Every time we ordered an appetizer, it would come after the entrees. The dish would come out AFTER we had already went up to pay for our bill.
- One waiter lied to us saying our pho was a large when in fact it was a small. 
- Portions are never consistent. 
- The waiters and waitresses tell us they can't put the rare beef on the side when they used to do it all the time. 
- I shouldn't have to wait 40 minutes for my dish. 
- We're not expecting much here. We know its a place to get food FAST and at a super reasonable price but the least the workers can do is smile a little and not throw our food on the table. 
- A simple request as to get more limes, or more water is always forgotten. 

This place is supposed to give us good memories but we can't help but have a bitter taste in our mouths after coming here this past year. Safe to say we won't be coming back for a while."}

{"text":"We came here yesterday looking for some hot and delicious Pho to warm us up and satisfy our ravenous hunger. I am by no means an expert on Pho, but damn this was good! Because my eyes are notoriously 10,0000 bigger than my stomach and I was famished, not only did I order the small rare beef Pho, but to my fb's horror and amusement, I also went ahead and ordered a Soursop shake and a small chicken vermicelli, which by the way comes with a springroll. The bf only got a small rare and well done bowl of Pho. The wimp. 

The Pho was delicious. The broth was addicting and not oily, and the amount of noodles in my bowl was just right. Also, for a person like me who really doesn't like beef all that much, I fund the beef in my bowl to be tender and pretty good. The chicken vermicelli was also pretty tasty, and the chicken was tender and not dry at all, with just the right amount of seasonings. My shake was delicious! I absolutely adore Soursop, and so for me this really hit the spot. Unfortunately, the shake was the only thing I could finish. Thankfully my bf also works as a vacuum cleaner of sorts and finished up the rest of my food for me. 

The service here is super quick and while it isn't friendly or outstanding, it is certainly efficient."}
{"text":"Had the pho and a shrimp curry dish. The pho was decent, nothing spectacular and they mixed up the shrimp dish with another shrimp dish.

Cash only."}

{"text":"We walked passed Pho Hung so many times in the past and noticed that it was always busy.  Finally ... last winter, after a excruciating final exam, a bowl of hot, tasty of Pho with thin slices of  beef was the only thing I could think about.

We love:
- Pho  The broth is quite tasty.  I haven't found a bowl of Pho from other restaurants as good as this one (well, except my aunt's restaurant in Thailand).  Love the proportion of broth, noodles and beef (in some restaurants, they give you way too much noodles and very little beef).  I generally order a Large, I don't know if I would ever be brave enough to try a bowl of XL Pho.  They might have to wheel me out of there.

- Vermicelli (Bun) with grilled pork.  Grilled pork is juicy and full of flavor, the large serving is quite satisfying.

This is one of our favorite places in town.  Good food, quick service and inexpensive.   Close to Green P parking."}
{"text":"The pho here is fairly standard. I think they recently added an XL large size which I don't remember seeing before. When I was looking up something in the menu on my phone, the old waiter told me to stop playing with my phone and order instead which I found quite rude. A policy printed on their menu also forbids clients from taking pho leftovers home."}

{"text":"Everytime I come here, I try to give them a chance, but even with already low expectations for service since it's an Asian restaurant, they never cease to amaze me with how bad they are. It takes them a good 10 minutes to finally take our order form away when it's pretty apparent that we're ready. We had to signal them numerous times, and even then servers would just walk on by and not even look in our direction. 3 servers stood at the cash chatting and 2 more at an empty table chatting. Then, not once but twice, servers brought food that wasn't ours to us and even though we said that we didn't order this, the servers insisted rudely that we did until the lady at the cash told them it wasn't. They took the food away and didn't apologize or say anything after their rude little show. The food is Meh but it's unfortunately one of the better places in Chinatown.

If people have a chance, go to Pho Dau Bo in North York instead. Much better service, better tasting food, and most Vietnamese people I know say it's the closest you can get to true Vietnam taste."}

Extra information:

*Lots of seating

*Cheap eats
*Dine in/Take out

Pho Hung is located on Spadina Ave near Dundas, just like every other Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant. I am assuming they joined 2 stores to create this odd looking random window-wall in between situation. But to be honest I don't really care how the store is laid out as long as I get my bowl of good pho noodle.

The restaurant has lots of windows and big seating area, bring all your friend and family! They have this small bowl filled with tiny red peppers...I wonder if you actually use them? They didn't look very fresh. Make sure not to touch these with your bare hands and rub your eyes after....if you do? don't blame me.


Ordered: Summer Roll ($4.00) 2/5

*I wasn't very hungry so I decided to order a Summer Roll. 
*Summer rolls  are these vermicelli + shrimp + lettuce all wrapped up in rice paper which you dip in peanut sauce. 
*Very small in size and could be thicker with more vermicelli. 
*Has basil leaf inside the roll and it might be a turn off for those who don't enjoy that specific herb
*Peanut sauce was very runny and I ususally like mine a little thicker with strong peanut taste. The sauce could have been stronger.


Ordered: Pho with Rare Beef #4 ($6.00) 3/5

*Personally I find Pho Noodle soups are the best on rainy days and night after drinking. I always like to add some hot sauce to the soup for that extra kick!
*Their small size is like regular size at other Pho places, so unless you eat a lot- just order a small and it will be enough for you.
*There are lots of meat (varying in whatever you ordered) and soup is flavorful (a little too oily) Lots of vermicelli and cooked perfectly, and you can add bean sprouts and basil to your likings


Ordered: Vermicelli Bowl #16 ($8.00) 4/5

*If you are feeling a little more adventurous or want something without a soup. They always have the Vermicelli Bowl option at Pho places. Note that this is usually $2-3 more expensive than the Pho noodles though.
*This is $8.00 but it is a huge dish for a size small
*There is a lot of meat on top as well as a big spring roll. Notice that the spring rolls are the authentic kinds, not the westernized version served at Food courts.
*Lemon Grass Chicken and Vietnamese sausage patties on top of the noodle
*Add fish sauce or hot sauce to your likings (fish sauce adds tangy vinegar taste)
*Lots of vegetables on top such as lettuce, cucumber, carrot, pickled radish, peanuts and bean sprouts
*Be Aware for those with Peanut Allergies!!


Bill came to $27.12 for 4 people.

Summary: Another popular Pho joint tried out to find my ultimate pho place....Pho Hung did live up to the hype somewhat. So far it's the best one but why does it have to be so far from my house? I will def be back, maybe after a night of drinking or on a rainy day next time :)"}
{"text":"Four of us ate at Pho Hung today March 12, 2017.  The only reason I didn't give Pho Hung a 0-star rating is because it can't be done.  

I found the service acceptable despite numerous reviews to the contrary.  Our waiter even drew to our attention the fact that the cold spring rolls we ordered might not meet our expectations, which was appreciated  And sure enough the spring rolls contained a virtually tasteless filling stuffed into what appeared to be a thin sausage casing.

Each of us started with a small bowl of pho.  The soup was bland. I got a #1 which included beef tripe and tendon.  How did so many reviewers recommending that soup fail to identify that the pieces of tendon are gelatinous and absolutely disgusting.  The rare beef in the soup was OK but nothing special.  And if you want tripe, try an eastern European restaurant for tripe soup.  By comparison, Pho Hung's version has no flavour and poor texture.

I fail to see why anyone would order any dish in the vermicelli section of the menu.  These dishes are essentially lo mein rice noodles served dry with no sauce whatsoever.  And there's no synergy between the noodles and any toppings.  I can't think of any Chinese restaurant over the last 50 years where I've had worse.

Will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Probably the most famous pho place in Chinatown, with its recognizable facade. I love the large windows and view onto spadina, making it a welcoming spot to enjoy a pho on a winter day. I have never been disappointed with the food itself, and their fresh spring rolls are a must try. The service is fast, but isn't friendly, and the bill isn't always very well presented so as to understand what's tip, what's tax and what's what. I have tried other pho places in the area that taste more authentic and deserve more attention, but overall this place remains true to its reputation and is a great choice for a first pho experience"}
{"text":"Love the noodles soup there 'cause they give more tendon than other Pho rest. Service is ok but very fast. This restaurant is really busy - the best time to go there is early lunch and early dinner."}
{"text":"Great Pho soup a bit more $$$ then ohers but very clean place well worth the extra $1.00 or so."}
{"text":"I go to PHO HUNG for the noodle soup # 5, I love this soup. Today I requested to remove the beef and tripe, I asked only for tendons. Its always been very good but today some of the tendons were tough so I could not eat it. What surprised me when I asked the server for a takeaway container, I was told I am not allowed to bring home my leftover. Has anyone had this experience? What is the reason why someone cannot bring home their leftover. Very strange!!! For that reason I am giving them 1 star"}
{"text":"I AM a fan of this place, this is my favorite pho in town, I've been to a few others and they're still delicious, but this one tops them in my opinion. The sprouts they give are crunchier, the overall taste is \"rounder\" and has a nice balance of sweet and sour. I still have tonnes more places to try out, but so far this is my go to place for pho. When I want pho, I want pho hung. I also love their cha gio.  I always order the same thing, the special pho, as it contains all the meat I love. The tender stuff, the beef, the tripes, so delicious and tasty, and I ALWAYS need my trusty bottle of hoisin/tuong den sauce in one hand to enhance the taste. My only regret is their tea which always tastes like the ninja turtles' toilet, but it's free and I'm here for the well-priced famous pho and I come out full and satisfied, and feeling refreshed! Pho hung? Pho sure."}
{"text":"OMG! The WORST service ever!!!

The Good: 
- it seemed pretty popular. Lot of people in the restaurant. That's usually a good sign, right?
- it was nicely lit & clean, especially for an Asian restaurant
- once we ordered, the food came to the table at a decent time
- the pho was pretty good. I had the spicy beef pho (#15e).

The Bad:
- we tried to order. After waiting for a long time for someone to come take our order, we flagged down a waiter...who ignored us. We flagged down a waitress...who also ignored us. We had to flag down 2 more people before someone actually told us to write down our own order on our own slip of paper!!!  (isn't that a waiter's job?)

- we asked for more tea. The 4 of us finished a pot of tea, and we left the lid up to signal that the teapot was empty. They took the teapot away...but that was it!  We waited a while, saw other people receiving new pots of tea.  We had to flag someone to ask for another pot of tea!!!

- the dishes came to random people at our table. My friend ordered a dish, but the waiter ended up serving it to me...even though I was pointing at her to receive the dish! Same thing for the next 3 dishes! We ended up playing \"musical pho\", just to so we could get the right dishes we ordered!

- hard to flag someone to pay. We waited forever for our check, and no one seemed to pay attention that we were done eating! We flagged one waiter for the check, who acknowledged us, but did nothing about it. After 5 minutes, we flagged another waiter for the check. Why were we even putting all this effort to flag someone to pay for an experience we didn't enjoy?!?! We were sooooo tempted to just get up & leave...and I don't think anyone would have noticed!

- crazy cleaning & re-shuffling of customers. They closed down 1 side of the restaurant, put the chairs up on the table, and cleaned that area. After they were done, they came to our side of the restaurant, and asked people to get up from their tables & be re-seated at different tables in the newly-cleaned side!!! I've NEVER seen any restaurant ask patrons do this before!!!

- crazy-strict rules! Cash only! If you don't finish your dish, you CAN'T take it home with you! If you split a dish with someone, you must pay a $4.75/person minimum, etc.


As we left the restaurant, I overheard one of the patrons ask her friend, \"Are we ever gonna get a menu?\"  Oh my, their nightmare was only just beginning..."}
{"text":"My review comes in two parts

Part 1: 4 stars
I would have given a half star more if you could pay any other way than cash. 
My fiancé and I have been here three times up to this portion of the review. Service was pretty fast, food is well priced and beer is cheap. I like the mixed veg with vermicelli noodles or shiitake mushrooms and bok choy over rice. My fiancé likes the dish with beef, pork, and egg roll over vermicelli, he also likes a bowl of congee on the side if he's really hungry. We usually find the small-sized portions are more than generous.

Part 2: 2 stars
Unfortunately, we went to pho hung recently and service was even less personable than usual. our food orders  came minutes apart and I had to remind the server about the tea refill I was waiting for (I wasn't drinking anything else).
Not big deals but just annoying combined with what happened next.
Not only one dish but two separate dishes had HAIRS in it. I was not charged for these dishes, which I appreciated, however I am concerned that I was not assured they would take measures to prevent that from ever happening again.

Pho hung is good, but I don't think I'll be returning any time soon - will probably look into other restaurants before considering it. Too bad because it was beginning to be one of our \"go to\"s."}

delicious.
I taste the chicken pieces.

My tummy pouts ( I am aware that a tummy does no such thing. I'm trying something new. Just go with it)
I am not fond of this Pho
'word' I reply. 
I squeeze more lime
Still, only favoring the broth
Maybe it was the hasty way I was rushed to order
Maybe I am accustomed to picky taste
Maybe it was the confusing menu (shishkebobs vermicilli?)
Maybe it was the horrible descriptions (lychee? on it's own or frozen, or as a drink?)
I took my green tea shots like a man
and took some more like shots
and paid my  bill of $19.75 (for 2 small chkn rice noodle + spring rolls (again, no descriptio of what kind)

{"text":"I have eaten at many Pho places in Mississauga. This one is special. Different than the others. Quality speaks for itself. The broth, quantity and quality of meat, service, prices. Go here for an authentic bowl of Pho you will never forget. Drake and Partynextdoor filmed a music video here, which is actually how I discovered this place. Many awards placed on the entrance doors. 5/5"}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat. Consistently good.

CAUTION: Avoid the washroom. It takes a lot to gross out my wife, but she's always talking about the poorly kept washrooms. 

Tea is served before we order. Sometimes the tables are a little sticky to the touch but you can ask one of the workers to wipe the table down.

Our hot and cold appetizers arrived promptly. The hot veggie spring rolls are always greasy and they're amazing tasting. Cold spring rolls come with a nice sauce with peanuts.

My soup filled me up and made me happy. My wife was due for a load of veggies.

If you're visiting you won't be disappointed, just go to the bathroom before you dine."}
{"text":"Food: 7.5/10
Atmosphere: 5/10 
Service: 6/10
Overall experience: 6.5/10

Seems to be a staple in the Chinatown area. The interior \"decor\" is non-existent - get ready for bare bones. But you're not there for the atmosphere, you're there for the food!

The pho (house special #1) and deep friend spring rolls are good. Considering the volume this place does, the items come out fast and piping hot. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: it's not the best Vietnamese food you'll ever have, but it's good enough."}
{"text":"Looking for quick service and descent pho in Chinatown - Pho Hung is your place.  

I have walked by this place on numerous occasions and just a couple of weeks ago I finally tired it out.  When you walk-in, you are instantly seated and menu are placed in front of you.  After my order was place, literally a few minutes later my pho arrived.  The service is super quick.

As for the pho, it is descent but I have had better elsewhere in the city.  

Like most places in Chinatown, payment is cash only.  They have an ATM in the restaurant.

Feel free to stop by Pho Hung if you are in the chinatown area."}
{"text":"Pretty good low-rent food - and you have to know this is borderline street food, cheap rather than fancy. I've had the pho and the (curry?) chicken soup. They make excellent fruit frappes with soursop and mango and strawberry, etc. Not totally sure how clean the place is or how safe it is to eat there."}
{"text":"The service is... tolerable, at best. Mind you, they're very fast, but not what I would call friendly. The spring rolls are alright, if a little too greasy for my taste.

That's okay though, because the pho is very good! I regularly order the rare beef pho. The broth is flavourful and aromatic, the meat is tender and trimmed well, and it all comes with a very generous portion of thai basil and bean sprouts. I also like the whole red chiles on the side- many places only offer hot sauce. 

I also have to give it to this place for keeping their bathrooms clean- a rarity in that area. 

Keep in mind that they only accept cash, so come prepared! I would recommend this place any day for a filling, steaming bowl of pho."}
{"text":"When I was younger, this was my favourite pho restaurant of all time.

Times have changed and pho is not really the same anymore. Plus, portion sizes are shrinking... I ordered an x-large and it had less noodles of a \"small\" at most other  Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"I frequented this spot many years back before they expand with the extension to the restaurant and the food was great. Coming from a Vietnamese family that loves good home cooking the broth for the pho was alright, the noodles they used was spot on though. But, on my most recent trip on the 4th of July weekend I came back to see how the place has changed. It's gotten more seating due to the expansion, however even with all those reviews on the door I'd say the food may be great to some extent the service was very poor. Though it may be faster to now write down your order on the meal ticket it was not widely known or explained to customers coming in as I notice some tables were waiting to be taken care of for excess of 10-15+minutes. even for just a glass of water or some tea it took forever.

Overall decent place to eat, just be ready to wait, if anything even if it's a family run business they need to lock down and coordinate better not have 4-5 different people coming to your table having no clue on what needs to be taken care of."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before don't expect to fit in.  The plop the order sheet on your table and walk off.  We were waiting on the waitress to take our order when we finally noticed another table wrote their order and it got picked up.  The food is average.  I would appreciate water but by the time I realized I needed to specifically ask I never saw staff again."}
{"text":"Yeah the food is fresh and good, reasonable with a crazy assortment of dishes BUT...

RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE

Manager & servers have that cold, reptilian East Asian attitude and treat customers like they are an annoyance that have to be undured and rushed out the door. Dont expect any smiles or fun here. My family was reprimanded when my 5 year old spilled her water. Crowded, uncomfortable seating, graffiti covered restrooms, kinda seedy, druggy neighborhood off Spandia.

Tip added to bill for party of FOUR, CASH ONLY. Lousy money grubbers. There are a million other asian establishments close by. Go someplace where you wont be treated with contempt."}
{"text":"I've only been once, so service might depend day by day, because I have seen some complaints about it.

However, we enjoyed the place.  I was craving pho after a long day of soccer drinking yesterday, and we needed to run some errands in Kensington anyway, so my husband and I decided to give this place a gander.  It was fairly crowded at noon on Sunday, but we were still able to get a table.  The server asks how many, seats you with tea, and gives you a menu and a paper where you write down your order.  My pho came before my husband's shrimp and sugarcane, but it wasn't a very long wait.  It's a very no-frill place in terms of service, but we didn't have any issues with the servers.  We got our food, our bill, and nothing was messed up on our order.

The menu is quite extensive, around 100 items, so there are plenty of choices no matter if you want meat, seafood, or vegetarian.  Be aware that soups cannot be taken to go, so keep that in mind when ordering size (small, medium, large).  It is also cash only.

I thought the food was quite good, although the pho could have used a little more beef.  The broth is delicious, and there was a good quantity of noodles in my soup.  My husband also really enjoyed his shrimp and sugarcane, although there was a bit of a learning curve for him and the rice paper.  This place is a solid 4 stars, perhaps 5 if you don't mind some bare-bones service and just want food.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"I ALWAYS get #66 with Shrimp. 
It's a sweet and sour tamarind based soup with okra, tomatoes, pineapple, and chilies. 
And order it with a side of rice or vermicelli noodles. 
So bomb."}
{"text":"Really good pho. Fast service, clean. Will come here next time I feel like pho again."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend. I had a large size pho, which I thought was cheaper and bigger. The food was alright and still filled me up. The service was prompt, and I would not mind coming back if I am nearby the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pho Hung for years now when I have a craving. This weekend, I happened to be strolling through the neighbourhood in the rain and decided to go and have some warm soup. Free tea was served without even asking (yay).

They give you a form to fill out for your order. Got the #1 small, for $7.00. Perfect size for one (I probably could have gone one size up). Tripe and all the various cuts of beef were yummy. A few squirts of sriracha and I was in heaven slurping up the broth. 

I like how they give you the bean sprouts, basil and lime on the side. I'm not a fan of bean sprouts (one of the only food that I don't care for!) so it saved me from fishing them out.

Absolute best place in the city for pho? I haven't been to enough places to judge. But it's tasty, quick, great value, and will be in my regular rotation of restaurants for years to come."}
{"text":"I love Pho Hung and have been coming here for years. The food is good for the price and it's always packed.

I DEFINITELY don't come to Pho Hung for the service - it's simply terrible. As you walk in you are silently gestured towards a table and the server throws a menu and some tea on the table. You scribble your order on a piece of paper and some time later, your food comes out in whatever order they feel like.

I usually order the Beef Satay which is deliciously garlicky and I'm told the Beef Pho is pretty good too. I'm fairly sure there is a ton of MSG in everything as I always walk away gasping for a drink. You get what you pay for, and at $20 for dinner for two, I'm not complaining.

In conclusion it's fast, cheap and not at all pretentious. Exactly what you want for a quick, cheap dinner. Tip: Cash only, don't even think about trying to pay by card."}
{"text":"I've been many times, I don't have any complains. the coffee with condensed milk is so good. everything in there are so delicious."}
{"text":"The place is nicer than other Vietnamese restaurants, but the food is overall mediocre. I really like their rice dishes but their pho is not as good as other nearby pho places. The servers are nice and the service is ok, so I'll give it a 3/5."}
{"text":"Amazing pho and the very large portions. Got the chicken pho here and it was delicious. The service was fast and the portions are massive. Normally I can finish a medium pho but their medium is like an XL. You get so much rice noodles and chicken that you will be stuffed. Price is reasonable as well. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Average pho at best.

I'm not sure why the restaurant is always packed. It must be mostly because of the convenient location and quick service. I find the broth to be fairly bland. Admittedly, I find myself adding extra sriracha, lime and basil to compensate for the lack of flavor. I also find the noodles to be a little too soft and would prefer them to be more firm. Perhaps I came on a bad day? The good thing is that the broth isn't too salty or MSG-laden (in my opinion) and the meat quality is decent.  
 
Their fried spring rolls are pretty pedestrian, but at least they are served nice and crispy. My go-to Vietnamese drink is the Che Ba Mau (3 color drink) and Pho Hung makes a passable one. Overally, I feel there are defintiely better Vietnamese options in Chinatown. I prefer Pho Xe Lua's noodles and broth and I wish Pho Kim Bo was still around the corner. Overall, not a terrible place to grab a quick pho, but not a great place either."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye on a cold but sunny day! I was hungry looking for something eat and i decided on this place cuz it looked full of people and It was darn cold outside! I knew what to order pretty much as soon as I was seated. I got my food within five minutes! i ordered a small rare steak pho and spring rolls. The meat was tender and and the spring rolls crispy and full of flavours. The small pho was the perfect serving for myself and finished every bite!"}
{"text":"Good pho not great large servings good price. The service is really terrible as others have stated. Had the #3 and the wife had the pho special #1."}
{"text":"Needed to get my Pho phix and since I'm no where near Markham or Scarborough today, chose to go to Pho Hung.  It's usually packed for lunch and dinner, I got in at around 3pm so there were lots of free tables.
I got:
- Small pho with rare beef and brisket
Even with a small it's still filling.  Flavour was good, but not the best. 
- Sour sop milk shake
Can't go wrong with this one... Especially on a nice summer day.

Service was fast, could use a bit of smiles tho. Altogether, the meal came up to $11. Pretty good price for a meal downtown.

Pho Hung is a decent place to get pho if I can't get over to Scarborough.
3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and have nothing bad to say about them. The broth is consistently good and the service is expected.  Despite being very busy, the turnover is quick and don't usually have to wait in a line. No downside is that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Great pho, noodles were perfectly cooked and meat was super tender.  Broth was SO flavorful...would've drank the whole bowl if I hadn't have gone into MSG-aphalactic shock.  

Fast and cheap...how I like......my food.  Haha. Small bowl was perfectly sized for a hungry Asian girl.

Minus 1 star for SHAMPOO IN THE BATHROOM!!  Shampoo does not = soap.  Would definitely not order spring rolls or anything not cooked here.  Drenched my basil in sriracha and lime juice just in case. Well, and cause I just love sriracha. :)

Skip the smoothies, they're kind of watery/not thick."}
{"text":"The pho is excellent. As good as ive had anywhere in Canada or US. As a solo diner I found the quick efficient service on a Saturday afternoon perfect. This is pho the way it is supposed to be. I will be back again with more of an appetite."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointing. The waiters don't have any sense of welcoming guests, and food takes FOREVER to arrive. I feel like the waiters don't know where they're delivering the orders to. The restaurant being busy is no excuse for slow service. I understand it might take a bit longer than usual but not THAT long. Disappointed. My sister got a cup with a lipstick stain on it. Tables around is who arrived later than us for their food before us and we ordered flippin noodles and so did they. I honestly felt that the staff were disrespectful towards customers with sass and attitude. NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN."}
{"text":"I read below someone remark that this is the best pho place in downtown??!! Seriously not the case.

The serving is decent and the meat is never of good quality although the broth can be a hit and miss and due to that i stopped ordering pho here, and actually just stopped going here.

Until again recently a friend insisted and what do you know the same quality of food. I decided against the pho knowing what i would get and went for the beef and rice. The rice was easily over a day old and the beef looked so over cooked it was barely edible. 

They do a decent Vietnamese coffee and i like the location and ease of getting seating for groups. If it is decent Pho you wan't then you will want to steer clear of here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in the sunny side room. Bustling, quick and very fresh.
Sometimes hard to get the servers' attention. Love the noodle soups, salad rolls (fun to \"roll your own\"), orange \"milkshakes\" and Vietnamese coffee. Big portions and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Came by on a rainy evening, perfect pho weather and this place was pretty good! I loved that they had many size choices since I really didn't want to waste food so mom and I ordered two small, one pho with everything and one bun with spring roll and pork. The pho soup was light, flavourful and not too salty while there was plenty of meat and only the amount of noodles was \"small\". The bun on the other hand was a little of the opposite filled with vermicelli and raw veggies with a small portion of grilled pork and one spring roll. Bro got a large lean beef pho and there was definitely more noodles but maybe not too much more meat? He liked it though since he was feeling a little sick. Overall though, the food tasted really good. I love bun and although it looked sparse, the flavour was all there with a little but of fish sauce. The pho was great and a perfect size!"}
{"text":"The crowded restaurant drew us in but my husband and I are not fans of this place.  Prices are a little more expensive than I expected.  I have had much better pho.  Service was meh.  Place felt kind of dingy.  Disappointed :("}
{"text":"After two disappointing visits to the Pho Hung located on Spadina, I finally found success at the Pho Hung in Mississauga.  

This time, I added sate (spicy seasoning) to my pho for an additional $0.50(???) charge and it made a world of a difference.  I really enjoyed it so much better.  My husband didn't think there was difference in the quality of food between locations but I did.

This location is also less busy, more spacious, and the service is friendlier.  I felt like I was able to eat my meal without feeling rushed.    

Yummy!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite places growing up. Sadly, they raised their prices immensely and aren't as welcoming as they used to be. Nonetheless, I still enjoy the food here and the interesting variety of things on the menu that might not be at a typical pho restaurant.

Firstly, I wouldn't be coming for pho as my first choice. It would be the bun (vermicelli). One of the unique bun is the curry chicken. Whatever the combination, I love the crispy spring roll and would usually pick a style of bun with that combination. The noodles are thin which compliments the vegetables in the way they are sliced. It's cool when you receive the fish sauce that it's in a sriracha bottle to add to your hearts content."}
{"text":"Was really craving a nice bowl of pho while traveling, and it did the job. Ordering was different from the 10 million pho restaurants I've been to. You write down your own order and give it to the server. Also, there's no napkin at the tables. It's weird, we had to tell them how many we needed...wtpho? Strange place, but decent pho."}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN TORONTO/best pho I've ever had. Sure it's loud and can get busy, but you don come here for the perfect ambiance. Service is always quick and pleasant. The small $6 bowl of beef pho is one of the most filling and satisfying cheap eats in the city. I've been coming here for years and I can't say enough good things about it. Broth is flavourful. Beef is tender and never fatty. Ingredients are fresh. Great salad rolls too."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I miss about living at home with my folks it's hot wholesome soup when I'm feeling kinda sick-y. It's not as easy to come by when you like 35-40 minutes away from momma, so sometimes you need a cheap substitute that kicks the crap outta your cold.

Thank you to all the Yelpers who wrote great things about this place because it was so close to home that I was able to drag my body outta bed, put it in ugly sweatpants and a beat up hoodie and plop down at one of the tables in Phõ Hung.

From the outside this place looks sorta like a dive to be honest, then you walk in... and it TOTALLY redeems itself. Seriously, it looks like some sort of a Thai palace inside (or at the very least a swanky fine dining spot). It was mid afternoon so naturally the place was empty so a seat was easy to come by and the service was quick.

I opted for a small deep friend spring roll (small comes with 2 rolls and a large comes with 4) as well as a large rare beef and brisket Pho. The quality of the ingredients, not to mention the presentation were spectacular in my opinion. Even in my weakened state I could appreciate how fresh the sprouts were, the beautiful branch of perfect/fresh thai basil and the other ingredients.

The spring rolls were excellent and 2 for one person is perfect so plan accordingly to order this up for your group when you visit. The soup was wonderful, clean delicious broth, piping hot and a massive portion. I know some have noted that the price is slightly higher than average but I like to think that I'm paying a little extra for the better quality stuff.

I left full and sweating, and soon there after I was feeling a lot better (at least for the time being), this might be a new go to spot for cheap and cheerful feel good Pho when the weather cools down.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Didn't find anything off with what we had during our visit last year. Don't expect much from the ambience,  but food will definitely not disappoint. Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for pho downtown.  Day or night - it's always busy so there is a high turnaround for food.  No matter what you order, it always comes out in record time, perfect for people like me who are starving at the sight/smell of food.  If you can communicate your special order to the staff then they are very accommodating to what you want.

Pho is always a good choice if your tight on budget.  Best cheap eats in my opinion.  Tsingtao beer is only $4.

I like that the soup is never too oily and the noodles are never overcooked.  On one occasion the spring rolls came over fried but I didn't complain or return it... just ate it extra crispy... still good.

I've tried the pho, vermicelli, rice dishes, spring rolls and shakes - you can try anything here and be satisfied.  The only thing I would be weary of is Item 15e since it has some shady looking meats.

Diners beware - this place is cash only!"}
{"text":"It's cheap here, I'll give it that.  And the service was quick and efficient.  But both dishes that I tried were a little lacking in flavour.  The pho broth was really bland and disappointing (the noodles and beef were fine though).  The curry chicken with rice noodles was a bit better.  I have a feeling that they really load up on the msg here as later that evening, my friend and I could really feel the effects.  Don't think I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"Idungetit.

I'm always told that this place is the best by people who I feel would know better than me (e.g. Viet friends, writers of New Yorker articles, and the like). But my tongue defies their description, and protests to me that, honestly, Pho Hung ain't all that. 

I mean, it's good enough - but it's pho; of course it's good. But can you do better, for cheaper, at multiple places within a couple blocks? IMHO, yes. 

I've given it at least three chances now, so I guess that's that. Peace."}
{"text":"This place for me personally could have been rated as a 2 star due to the fact that the Bun Mam that I ordered was tasteful. HOWEVER, besides that, nothing in this place was worth the time and money that my family and I spent here. 

First, their sign said 10am they'll open up. We stood outside since 9:57 and waited until they opened up. The owner saw all of us waiting outside and even when the clock stuck wayyyy past 10am he managed to ignore us and continued to made us wait. 

Once we got inside, things seemed to be understandable since they just opened in the morning and were very incoordinated. We all managed to eat what we ordered but also felt very disappointed because some of the Pho dishes had NOTHING other than slices of beef fat. 

I could not have given this place more than a 1 star simply because THEY INCLUDE THE TIP in the final charge. I don't think it is right that they charge you tax AND pre-calculated tip as part of the final charge. Tipping or not depends on the service. It is not a guaranteed or mandatory thing. Completely left this place feeling like we all got robbed of our money."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. Ok or miss service. You need to drench your pho in oyster sauce before your taste bud can even taste something. Pretty dang average."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious. Much better than pho 88 down the street. The spring rolls are a good recommendation, as well as vermicelli options."}
{"text":"This is a must go place for me during weekend. I like their beef soup with spicy sauce. 08A on the menu. And their curry chicken rice is also a must try item on the list. This place is cheap, offers a large bowl of soup and declicious"}

{"text":"Haven't been to this place in ages, I orderd #08 Rare beef and brisket.large $7.50.  Size was good with right amount of meat.  The soup base was one of the best I had in awhile.  This is a pho place so I didn't expect much service especially when all the sauce, spoon and chopsticks was already on the table.  But the staff did their job swiftly and disappeared until we asked for the bill."}
{"text":"Pho is love, Pho is Life. Whenever I go to a Pho restaurant I always get the Rare Beef and Brisket Pho and this place would still always be one of my favourites. Service was really fast and efficient while maintaining customer satisfaction and the food was amazing just like any other really good pho restaurant. Pho broth is on point, noods and beef we really good also. Wish there were more noods though, but it's aight. Cold Springrolls with that peanut sauce was really really good and I do recommend it if you aren't allergic. I don't usually eat peanuts but that sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"Quick service, good portions, hearty pho. Nothing to write home about but I got what I wanted when I walked into the restaurant, which is a good bowl of pho. The brisket was quite soft. 

We went around 2PM so the place was quite empty but it was hot inside. Not sure how comfortable patrons would be eating when the place is more full. 

Didn't have trouble with service like other reviews have noted."}
{"text":"I just love Pho Hung, full range of variety,  I've tried a few different things each time, it won't let me down. I like their soup base of pho, no MSG , so clear but really tasty."}
{"text":"Always good pho! Perfect for cold winter days - it warms the soul!
Ask for the one with raw meat. If you are not too hungry, order the small. It's a good portion the large (there is no medium) is really big - no appetizer for you! The X-Large is ridiculous! But can be good for sharing although pho is not really sharable ;)
Been back many times and always will.
Remember: they only take cash!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty mediocre, I've caught some dirty utensils here and there... I also had a bowl of cold pho before but it's generally a standard Vietnamese restaurant. This would not be a go to though if I recommended a pho place, this is like a last resort and I'll deal with it type of restaurant."}
{"text":"As always, this place is flocked with people in the heart of China town. This place has been here since I was just a kid and the pho is certainly authentic. The restaurant is opened by pure Vietnamese people and my family comes by this area for pho when we happen to be around China town.

We ordered the pho dac biet (special) and Vietnamese iced coffee.

The pho tastes authentic. A small portion was enough to fill me up! They put in a ton of sliced beef, beef balls, tendon... The ratio of meat to rice noodle was higher than average. The soup tasted good (though I'm sure there's msg so I avoided finishing it all :P).

Overall a decent Viet meal for a great price (13-15 bucks ish."}
{"text":"Bun mam is good here.
Sucks that the costumer service here is so terrible that it just ruins the whole experience.
We specifically told the waitress our order and it's important not to get it wrong due to severe allergies . But she still got it wrong, instead of apologizing and offering to get a new order she made it seem like we were the ones who were making it a big deal. 

Food- good

They should really change their foh staff. 
Or at least the young lady with glasses"}

me: (STARE)

employee: I can throw it away if you want

me: yes please throw it away, thank you

I have NEVER heard of something so ridiculous at a restaurant ever in my life. If the employee dares to do that in front of customer not thinking there is a problem, imagine what they do behind our backs"}
{"text":"Pho Hung has become the go-to place when craving Pho or vermicelli.  The broth for the Pho is very flavourful, and unlike many other places, does not overkill it on the salt.  The vermicelli dishes are also delicious and the portions very generous (always have leftovers for a second meal, although it's tough keeping myself from eating it all at once).  Service is always consistent, never had to wait too long for food.  If you want extra spice, they have a chili paste that you can request."}
{"text":"Clearly one of the best in the city for what it is and thanks to Stanley for bringing me here. I always have the Pho Ga and have never been disapointed. Avoid rush hours and you should be able to get a table. The service is a bit unorganzied and don't be surprised if they get your order wrong.  The staff is fast but not too friendly. I like it for the pho ga, I've tried a few other dishes and they were just ok for me, but seem authentic based on my trip to Vietnam."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's always packed but never has slow service. I like sitting in the room with all the windows rather than the main restaurant part. I usually order a large pho with rare and beef ball. So delicious. I have also had the wonton soup which is very good as well as the fried spring roll and fresh spring roll. Everything is amazing and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I love pho - one of the best comfort foods! This is my go-to pho place downtown, and it actually beats a lot of the ones I've tried in the Markham/Scarborough area. I like to order the house special (#01) with a side of spring rolls (#62). The broth is almost always hot, clear, and flavourful. The beef is pretty good and same goes for the noodles."}
{"text":"I discovered Pho Hung about 10 years ago as a poor starving student. Where else can you get a huge delicious bowl of steaming soup with mounds of tender meat for about the price of a coffee at Starbucks?!

As the name implies, Pho Hung specializes in Vietnamese Pho soup. This delicious soup that can take up to 6 hours to make is all about the broth. I've had Pho in a lot of other places in Toronto and across Canada and the US and Pho Hung definitely makes the best broth.

My top favourites at Pho Hung, especially on a cold winter day, are a large bowl of the raw beef Pho soup with a side of crispy Vietnamese spring rolls. These rolls are lightly deep fried and served with an AMAZING sweet chili sauce. 

As with most Vietnamese restaurants, they serve you tea as you sit down. Hot in winter and iced in summer.

The staff is always extremly quick and friendly; even though Pho Hung is always packed, you  never have to wait more than a few minutes to get a table.

The owner is an avid fisherman and proudly displays photos of his catches, as well as a few mounted trophies, in the restaurant.

If I had a last meal on earth it would probably be an extra large raw beef Pho Soup from Pho Hung.

Note: Bring some cold hard cash. No plastic here."}
{"text":"Pho is very good and cheap. Good portion size. Cold spring rolls are worth getting as well.

Service is what you would expect of a busy pho restaurant in the middle of China Town.

Has been and will continue to be my go-to for pho."}
{"text":"I have eatten at many Vietnamese places around Toronto and Pho Hung is definitely one of the top places around.  Pho is all about the broth and they make a delicious tasting pho broth here that is clean and leaves you wanting more.  The place is not the best looking inside and the service isn't the best you'll be getting, but the food makes up for it all, for the most part.

I usually order the Special Pho bowl along with fresh shrimp rolls and crispy spring rolls.  The Special is great and comes with a decent amount of beef with it.  The large is more than enough to fill you up, but if you're up for it the xl bowl will set you straight. 

Their Vietnamese coffee here is great along with their avacado shakes both a staple in Vietnamese dessert drinks.  Overall a great place to eat Vietnamese food and their prices are hard to beat.  Make sure to come here with an empty stomach as a few appetizers and a bowl of pho will leave you nicely stuffed!   I'll definitely be coming back to try more rice noodle bowls!"}
{"text":"Seems like a pretty decent Pho place judging from the fact that is always packed. The service is decent (Cash only) and the meals delivered exceptionally quick. I usually opt for something with Vermecilli instead of the actual Pho but last time I was here I had the Special Pho (16) with Pork and Rice Noodles. The broth was a bit different then the standard Pho, and tasted more like Wonton Soup. Small is plenty for one person.  Overall, I think there are a few better Pho places in the city, but this place is decent"}
{"text":"Wasn't quite sure what to expect when I walked in, but this place blew my mind. The service leaves a bit to be desired (but they're also super busy), but the food makes up for it. The curried chicken is literally life changing. Portions are HUGE too! I got a small bowl and couldn't finish it.

They do have an ATM, but the buttons don't work very well, so try to get cash before (cash only)."}
{"text":"So I used to have a Pho Hung right around the corner from my workplace and I learned to love Vietnamese cuisine there. It was heartbreaking for me and everyone I work with when they closed down to make way for a new condo development. I was pretty excited to see this one in Mississauga and beat a path to the door.

It was everything I remembered but better. While the Bloor Street location had definitely become pretty run down by the end, this had the sparkle of a suburban franchise. But we're there for the food, not the ambience, right?

Yum, yum, double yum, triple yum yummy. I had the curried coconut tofu on vermicelli  and introduced my friend to the vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring rolls. Admittedly those spring rolls could still use a little less time in the deep fryer, but then it wouldn't be Pho Hung. What also makes it Pho Hung is freshness and incredible flavours. Suitable for both the novice and experienced Vietnamese cuisine  gourmand.

Spadina's closer but not nearly as pleasant. Yes, I like a little ambience with my food."}
{"text":"I am giving an enthusiastic five stars for what this place is, which is an authentic cheap & cheerful Vietnamese restaurant. It's not fancy as the service isn't amazing, but the food is so good!!

The pho is delicious. The flavours of the broth are complex, the portions are enormous & the price is really reasonable.  I also had a Vietnamese coffee, served in the traditional way, which was excellent. Spring rolls were also super tasty. 

The menu is massive with options for everyone, including a whole vegetarian page. The space is really large and very clean. You write down what you want on a notepad and can only pay cash.

5/5 for this awesome & delicious place. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tremendously reliable service & decent food at a great price point. My go-to restaurant whenever I'm in the Kensington/Chinatown area. I would recommend the Special Pho - keep in mind to only get what you think you can finish, because you can't really just take noodles home for later."}
{"text":"Excellent food, medium place presentation. 
If you put authentic food and tastes above bathroom cleanliness and like Vietnamese food, you cannot go wrong with this one. 
For vegetarian dishes make sure you specificly ask and write down what you want. Food was served fast but place was packed at 2:30pm... so make sure you add finding a place to your lunch window allowance. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This is \"the\" Toronto Pho institution, so if delicious rare beef noodle soup in rich, tasty bone broth is your game, then Pho Hung is your spot. 

I was a longtime, borderline embarrassing regular of this place's old Yorkville location, and when it shut down I went into a several week period of mourning, public tears and soup alienation before I figured out that my pho fixation (phoxation? I'm so sorry) could be satisfied at the other location over on Spadina. 

The menu is huge, most items worth ordering are extremely inexpensive and everything, to my admittedly limited knowledge, is fairly authentic. The flavours are good, the meat and brisket in your pho bowl is plentiful and the joy is boundless. Pho-King right! (I'm even more sorry, kind of).

Obviously, though, all good things have their limits- superman had Kryptonite, Momofuku has appetizers sized for my childhood Barbie dream house and the Pickle Barrel has its entire menu, so be advised of Pho Hung's limitations--- the service can be Soup Nazi levels of brusque, a lot of white rice finds its way into 100% of dishes and the decor is kind of institutional, but, for a great meal at less than $10, it's pretty worth it for my poor, debt saddled little soul.

Hooray!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a suggestion. Ordered an extra-large rare beef + brisket pho.

In short, this was the worst pho I have ever had. The soup was a watery mess. The noodles tasted too much like rice, meaning that the flavor of the soup wasn't penetrating into the noodles themselves. Perhaps that's because there was no soup flavor in the first place.

Every cut of meat seemed to have been taken from the worst parts of the cow; nothing was chewable. I told the server that there was a rubber band in my soup. She said that was meat. She was right; there was another rubber band-like piece of meat in the pho. It completely turned me off.

The most telltale part that it was bad pho is that a good pho has a lovely aroma when the server presents it to you. In this case, there was no smell at all.

How this place has three locations is beyond me. There are much better pho places in the city, or if you can pay a little extra, go for Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Was just here the other day and it was a non-meal time of day so didn't have to wait for a table or anything. That's a plus. 
My friends got the raw beef pho and i tried it. It was great! 
But i wasn't in the mood for pho, so i got the stir fried beef with onions and vermicelli. The beef was so tasty and flavourful! I'd definitely recommend it. Yum. Started off with hot and fresh veggie spring rolls. Really crispy and good. Although i like my spring roll sauce a bit sweeter than the sauce the have here.
If ever i'm in the neighbourhood again (not too often though) then i'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Best pho place in Toronto been coming there for ten years.

The bun is amazing as well as the shrimp fresh rolls. 
Seafood pho is loaded with seafood and noodles.
Definitely recommend coming here with friends and family because it is a great environment for all meal occasions.
Service is decent, do not request more than one thing at a time."}
{"text":"Al dente noodles in a bowl of flavorful beef broth. You can definitely taste the essence of bone marrow in the stock. The pho was the star! Fresh spring rolls paled in comparison."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick and good prices. 3 words every student wants to hear. Their 'small' portions are huge :)"}
{"text":"Pho hung is where I was sitting across a nba star, and didn't even notice until he made small talk, I won't blow his cover since this is his favourite spot for pho ;) When I came here, it was very busy and their was plenty of seating, your choice of either dining area or den area. This place seems a little old and run down but I feel like the owners try their best to keep it clean and functionable. To start I ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls that come with peanut sauce. It was fresh, light and flavourful and the peanut sauce really tied everything together. For my main, I had the small house special Beef Pho. Honestly, I can't do pho that has chicken or pork in it, since I feel like those particular meats don't taste the same. Once my pho arrived, it was piping hot and the beef was delicious! I added a ton of Sriracha sauce and my pho was perfect. I will definitely come back to bump into some other sports celebrities and try more options on the menu ;)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here occasionally since high school. That's roughly a decade. That tells me that I'm so old and the food will always be good."}
{"text":"We happened upon this restaurant while exploring Toronto for a day.  Not being familiar with the region/neighborhood, we were a bit cautious.  

We noticed shortly after we arrived, the owner confronting a patron as he was leaving.  Not sure what happened there, but we realized later.  This is why I rated this restaurant 1 star...

We knew the items were listed in Canadian dollars so when the waitress came by with our tea, we asked if they accepted American dollars.  She said yes.  We asked another waiter the same question, he said yes.  We enjoyed our meal but waited a long time for the wait staff to take our payment so we left the equivalent of American dollars (current exchange rate was around .66 to 1 American to Canadian).  The owner came running after us and told us we need to pay more.  She said her exchange rate was .9 to 1.  When we asked why, she just smiled and said we owed more.  We explained that the wait staff never said anything when we asked about American dollars but the owner snickered and said, \"you never asked.\" We ended up paying $30 for a $23 meal.  What was so angering was the realization that the wait staff and owner seemed to purposefully deceive American tourists by withholding important exchange rate information.  It became clear that this restaurant takes advantage of the naivete and lack of confidence of tourists.  I believe now, that the man who was confronted in the beginning was also duped!!

There are many Pho restaurants in this area.  Choose another one!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to this restaurant. The food is great, used to be one of my favourites in Chinatown. Service is also decently fast and you can expect their menu to have everything you'd expect from other restaurants.
Pho and vermicelli are my recommended picks.

Nice place for summer days with their enclosed patio space.

Only reason I stopped coming here is that I was told they tips don't go to the servers."}
{"text":"This was my original Chinatown goto Pho place! I completely forgot the name until I seen it in the recent reviews on the welcome page. Awesome! This place rocks!

The pho here is delicious. The price is right. The spring rolls are good. Meh what else is there to say. The service is alright. The location is alright -- clean enough for me.

This place is nothing special but it was one of the first Pho restaurants I tried in Toronto and I was lucky that I walked into a half-decent one when I did. This is a good quality restaurant but there are no aspects about it that make me want to yell out a suggestion to visit it."}
{"text":"We came here just because it used to be our go to place years ago. After tonight, we shouldn't have bothered. Definitely won't be coming back. 

So so flavours, small portions, expensive and they forgot our orders. Honestly we wonder why people still come when a much better pho restaurant, XeLua is a few doors down."}
{"text":"They don't allow guest  to take the leftover food to go.  It's ridiculous.   I just ordered a XL which is too much for me, and I decided to take back home as my dinner. They said it's gonna expend u can't take to go . I don't mind I have been eating vermicelli for whole  my life . That's my choice.. I don't get why we waste it ?   Plus they don't have the pickle pepper ..there are tons of places better than this one nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Pho and delicious Vietnamese dishes. The food here does not hold back on flavor and spice and does not cater to Canadian tastes. They proudly offer multiple varieties of Pho, of them I've only tried about five, but they've all been phenomenal. This place tends to get packed very early so if you are able to get in for dinner, consider yourself lucky."}
{"text":"Every time i walk by this place there is always a lot of people. Decided to see whats all the hype about. Order their special pho with rare beef and cold shrimp rolls both were average. Soup was a bland. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Imo, they gave me a pretty bad first impression. I came as a group of five, and the guy who greeted us quickly pointed to a table that should've only fit four. It wasn't like there weren't bigger tables--he just chose the closest table without looking around...also didn't help that he didn't seem too friendly.

Although the food came out quite slow, my actual meal was pretty tasty. I got bun bo hue, which is the meal I always choose to determine whether this is legit Viet food or nah. It tasted great, but it lacked some of the classic garnishes that come with the dish. 

I do find that this is a lot pricier than I'm used to. I know it's Toronto and it's busier but the prices here are roughly $3-4 more than where I live! The portions are definitely not worth the price.

Overall, if you want pricey decent-tastingViet food, then here you go. Don't expect much of the service though."}
{"text":"Ummm...their logo looks suspiciously like The Laughing Cow's (spreadable cheese). Trademark issues, anyone? I almost did not step into this place because it looked shady

However, I'd have to say that this is one of the better pho places i've been to (and i've been a lot of them...). 

I got a Large Pho with beef balls since they did not have my 'usual' Crab Bun Rieu (Crab meat with egg in tomato soup)

The portion was huge...i wish there was a 'medium' size, but it literally went from S to L to XL. 
Soup was tasty; not the usual pho soup i've tasted which frankly, puts me off pho. 
Total came to $8 including tax but not tip

Place was packed, service was fairly quick and i was in and out in less than25 mins"}
{"text":"There is almost no point in reviewing Pho Hung on Yelp because it has become a Toronto institution and meeting place--I can't tell you how many times I've met my mom outside (to go somewhere else). Sure this place has locked \"pho\" down to a formula, but they are probably worn out from being on one of the busiest corners of Toronto for years.  You can taste their tears.  But not their soul:

You will get the
- same reliable pho
- same sprig of basil
- same clatter of tea cups
- same fluorescent lighting
- same spooky washrooms
- same D'OH moment when they want cash only
- same greasy deep fried spring rolls
- same efficient, but dead-inside service

For people looking for authentic Vietnamese food, or some inspired experience of Vietnamese dining, keep looking!  For people looking for \"pho\", see above. Just realize that this is colour-by-numbers, cafeteria, step-mom pho."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 if I could. This had undeniably the worst service that I have had in Toronto. The person who should have greeted my family and I were yelling and telling us that we couldn't sit further from the window. On top of that, they told us that we had to order more food than we needed. I am appalled by how inconsiderate they were to the situation. Their restaurant is a hole in the wall with crammed seating and an unfinished dining room.  We didn't even sit down long enough to eat. The cherry on top was that they were an all cash establishment. I was unsatisfied with the service, very hungry and my day was ruined with this whole experience."}
{"text":"Best price/size/taste ratio Pho in town!
Prices $5-9 for a Pho bowl. 
Their Pho is supersized: Small - is Large, Medium - is XL, and XL is probably a gallon of Pho.

Never tried anything except #6 there, and always keep taking it - and it as good as it gets!

Great Pho! A+"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho that I have tried within Metro Toronto so far. Highly recommended.  Though their fried spring rolls need improvement.  Rua Vang has better fried springrolls."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good but the food was even better. Big portions and tasty! The broth is extremely flavourful and the pho comes with lots of meat. This definitely gets five stars considering the amount of food I got and the quality of the food for under 10$. My new go to pho spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! The food is delicious. The portions are generous. The service is quick and efficient. The prices are acceptable. It's always packed so be prepared to sit wherever there is space available in the dining room. It adds to the experience to the experience though."}
{"text":"If you want an XL bowl of Pho you best come here because their XL is mighty large. Great Goi Ga, the service is great, even though the owner is never at this location, the employees are always working hard."}
{"text":"Dont be discouraged by the location; the pho here is probably the best in Toronto!!

The broth is sooo gooddd!! And the rare beef is very tender and doesn't have a lot of the fat on the edges that some bad viet restaurants serve.

The restaurant itself is a lot bigger than I expected, and cleaner too. Also, it's very multicultural even though it's in Chinatown hahah :)"}
{"text":"I've never had a pho I didn't like, and this place is no exception. Combining all of my favourite elements:  fast, tasty, and cheap, Pho Hung is a solid option for a no frills lunch or dinner in the Dixie/Dundas area. The restaurant was busy when I walked in on a Sunday night, which is saying a lot for the suburbs. Also, Drake filmed a video outside of this place which makes it instantly cooler."}
{"text":"Usually eat there once or twice a week, and been like that for almost 5 years.  I usually always stick to the pho, but shakes, springrolls, bun are all good.  They also have this deep fried fish dish that is amazing!  hidden Gem.

They lose points for the following:
They jacked up the price because of their popularity.
They aren't opened past 10pm.
Recently their cutlery smells like bleach such that every time I go I have to wash them again with the tea.

The last point is a major dissapointment for me, and I've been meaning to talk to the owner about it.  But... still not enough to pull me away."}
{"text":"Great food mired by extremely poor service.  Very disappointed with their attitude and ignoring of me while listening to my white friends.  When we ordered our food they took no time to remember who ordered what, or at least ask who ordered what.  They constantly rolled their eyes at us.  The acted like children who were caught red handed with their behaviour.

If I wanted this level of surly service I would have gone to Church St and be served by a drag queen.

Management please address these issues with your employees as I had visitors with me who should not have been exposed to this service."}
{"text":"Ok. I do really like this place for its food and prices. 

but the waitresses most of the time are just so non friendly and even rude. that I just don't get it. 

however, visited it just few days ago and one of the waiters serving us actually smiled and was super nice and even joked around. that almost shocked me. but then also made me happy. finally they have some cool people working there so I don't have to be always afraid of my service experience when I'm enjoying my place of stirred fried veggies and yummy fried tofu=)"}
{"text":"Really good pho for really good price. Service is questionable but that's what you get for the price."}
{"text":"I used to love eating at Pho Hung but not so much anymore.  Over the years, the portion sizes have been steadily shrunk while the menu prices have consistently increased!  My favourite to order at any Vietnamese Pho restaurant is of course the Pho Dac Biet (special) but there's nothing really special about their's.  Broth is okay, again portion sizes smaller and the garnishes are very skimp.  Worst of all is the service!  You have to try to flag someone down to pick up your order form and last time we were there, I had ordered a Pho Dac Biet while my uncle ordered a Bun Bo Hue.  They brought out my Pho and of course I waited until his order came for us to dine together.  We waited about 10 minutes with no Bun Bo Hue in sight.  Finally, I nicely asked a server that we're still waiting on his order and she said \"don't worry about it\" in a flat rude tone!  Incredible!  I mean, I understand since the staff is not allowed to keep their tips (yes, the owner keeps them all so don't feel obligated to tip generously for such poor service anyway!), there's really no incentive to provide great service but geez, there must still be some service standards in the industry...even in Chinatown!  Anyway, after that incident, it's very unlikely that I'll voluntarily dine at Pho Hung again...unless I'm desperate for some hot broth and can't find it elsewhere!

Update: since this review, I really have not patronized this restaurant again...and that's 3 years!  Now, I feel obliged to share that it is true that the OWNERS DO NOT ALLOW THEIR STAFF TO KEEP THEIR TIPS!  I have been informed through firsthand knowledge that employees are paid an illegal $8/hour in cash so technically, the owners are generating obscene profits as the busy clientele always means that the tips pay for staffing several times over!  Really an injustice.  Explains the poor service though...but can't blame 'em.  For this main reason and the overall declining customer experience, really can't ever bring myself to dine here again."}
{"text":"I ordered Bamboo duck soup, and my husband got grilled pork rice dish; both turned out delicious! Great services, very clean bathroom, it is always my concern whenever I visit any restaurant."}
{"text":"Now that I live downtown, this is my go-to pho restaurant in Chinatown. I know there are so many other places, but why fix something that isn't broken? 

I always order the cold shrimp rice rolls and the beef pho (with all types of beef) and it never fails to disappoint. It is perfect for those cold winter nights or rough weekend mornings. 

Expect the standard pho restaurant amenities and ambience though. There's nothing fancy about this place. You'll get your food and your belly will be happy, but that's basically it. The service is very quick and the place is pretty big so you should have no issues getting a seat.

Oh and...they're cash only!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, along with another couple decided to get some pho. When we walked in we were seated right away although the place was packed. We ordered the rare beef, tendon and tripe with rice noodle. It was spicy just the way we had requested. No complaints on the food. Also the restaurant is surrounded by windows which adds a nice touch.

Cons:
I would rate the cleanliness as 2/5. 
The water cups were very dirty, so we had to order a can of pop. 
The washroom did not have hand soap, instead it had a bottle of shampoo! 
Only one of the taps were working in the washroom, which caused a line up.
The staff were very stingy with the napkins. They literally counted each napkin and gave only one per person every time we requested for a napkin."}
{"text":"Best pho in Toronto! I say this with authority being that I have tried almost all of them.. Pho hung has amazing food, ok atmaphere (i always take it to go) as far as taste goes pho pasture is the 2nd best but the place looks like a dump, the rest are like playing Vietnamese food roulette where sometimes its good and other times you bite into a chicken knuckle or chewy piece of meat that just refuses to breakdown like Chernobyl bubblegum."}
{"text":"Gotta have pho!  Especially Pho Hung Pho!  Ordered jackfruit shake, #1 pho, #7, and fresh rolls.  Broth is really rich and tasty.  Better than Pho Dau Bo just down the street IMHO.  Rolls were freshly made.  Been here for lunch and dinner and was a good experience both times."}
{"text":"Visited the pho place after passing it many times in Chinatown. 
Ambience: Lots of people on a Friday night, we got a seat at the back of the extebded part of the restaurant. Was little hot back there abd when asked, the server couldn't do much except telling me the a.c. was on. 
While looking through the menu, we realized we didn't get any water or tea that all others received when they were attended by a server. The order: Since we were hungry, had to call the server to order. Ordered special beef pho and the beef sate (spicy version) pho. Arrived early and hot. No cut green chillis with the condiments though (we love chillis!), found whole ones on the table. 
Food: Broth was good but could have been richer compared to my past pho experience in Toronto. The special beef pho had rare beef, well done beef, tripe which was amazing value for 50c more than regular beef pho! 
Price: good value. Remember CASH ONLY! 
Overall: ok pho. Good for quick meal."}
{"text":"Shocked at this place as it's definitely not like their location in Chinatown!    
I don't recommend this place unless you want bad service and food!   There was just one other occupied table but it seemed all they were interested in was mopping the floor with some really strong lemony floor wash.     The male waiter took our order, plopped it down and never checked with us again at all.   Condiments & napkins were scarce.    You need to beg for them here.   Pho Dau Bo where we frequent has everything right on your table.    Use as much as you like.     It's still my fav. Mississauga pho place and prices are amazing and so is the variety of dishes.   We ordered a large beef pho which was ok ($9 with a average size bowl).   I ordered a lg. curried chicken vermicelli with spring rolls($9.5).   I noticed a hair in my dish and just removed it.  My stomach was not feeling too amazing about eating out.   We had to ask for a takeout container for my son's large pho and the owner (lady) said we don't have containers!    Are you kidding me?!     Then when I moved my dish away I noticed another hair.     I was appalled!    Good thing they didn't have any take out containers!  
I gotta start home cooking!   Just made us a batch of Rice Krispies square to wash this mesh out of our systems.    Avoid please!"}
{"text":"I normally don't give negative reviews but this place really let me down. 

I decided to stop by and have the house special bowl of pho. The broth was very simple, nothing exciting about it. The reason why I am giving at least 2 stars is that the food came quickly once we placed our order but other than that, the service by the staff is absolutely the worst. Never been to a place with such horrible customer service. They ignored us several times once we were trying to get their attention. We didn't even come at a busy hour, staff were mostly on their phones so they can never see you if you're waving your hand for their attention. I had to ask several staff multiple times to just get a pot of tea. They ended up giving us the bill 5 minutes after our food arrived when we haven't even touched our meal yet. 

The large bowl of pho was also very small and not really worth the price. Probably wouldn't be coming back here for pho unless you're craving it. Also sucks because not many good pho places around Chinatown."}
{"text":"Self serve place with decent pho, not the greatest I've had. My overall experience is that it was okay. There are other pho places I'd go instead tbh"}

There is always a line up to get a table, but it definitely worths the wait."}
{"text":"By far the best place for pho! My favorite: number 6 (pho very well done) + number 63 (cold spring rolls) + canadian with lemon ="}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, we had to trek all the way to Spadina to get to Pho Hung. We were so happy they opened a branch in Mississauga. We are regulars here. Pho Hung has become our default go-to restaurant whenever I don't feel like cooking or we just want something warm, soothing and nourishing. We love their chicken wings. It is a simple fried chicken wings recipe with a slightly spicy kick. It is neither breaded nor battered. I highly recommend it.

My other favorites are:

Special fried rice
Minced Shrimp and pork wrapped in tofu skin
Fish congee (this is clean tasting with lots of ginger)
Grilled curried chicken with rice (the curry is very subtle so it does not overpower the chicken)
Fried spring rolls
Fresh noodle dish with grilled chicken, fried spring rolls and vegetables (there are a variety of toppings you can choose from but I particularly like this combination. The one with grilled pork is also good)
Special sour soup with fish (no bones; this dish reminds me of a healthier version of a  Filipino dish. It has a lot of vegetables. I'm part Filipino but I love this dish more.)
BBQ pork chop, shredded pork, steamed quiche, fried egg with rice (this is my husband's latest favorite)
Avocado shake 
Vietnamese coffee (cold; this is my husband's favorite)
And of course, the Pho (we have tried a lot of Pho places but we find their pho the best for our palate)

This location is bigger, cleaner, and has more parking spaces than the Spadina branch."}

It's clean, well lit inside and the menu offers an assortment of vietnamese dishes from Bun, Pho, Broken rice and they are well known in some circles for the crispy chicken wings and their spring rolls. The Pho is consistent here, perhaps not the best broth in town but it is always hot, served quickly and tasty. And another plus is that the beef is of good quality and slice paper thin!!

Noodles are not fresh nor do they have saw on their herb plate these are minor inconveniences. Plus during their peak times one can feel like a cow wading through their wham bam thank you ma'am service. And lately their prices have been creeping up in that it is no longer a steal to eat here as it once was. But if you're just getting to Pho or vietnamese food in general, this would be a good place to start before branching off."}
{"text":"Worst service, would not allow us to take food to go. The Vietnamese food is not authentic. I would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place has 3 stars. It's a really great spot. As soon as you walk in they greet you with a complementary pot of hot green tea. It really hit the spot when we walked in after being out in the cold. 
The spring rolls were amazing, we ordered a pho and he stew, both were really good, and also ordered a vegetarian tofu curry, and that was really good too. And the prices were great 7-8 dollars per dish and it was a good portion. This is actually my go to pho place from now on. And I'm a really picky guy, you can see some of my other reviews. 
Maybe they recently had a ch age in management or something but this pace deserves at least 4 Stars. 
I feel like maybe some of you think that for a place to have 4/5 stars, it needs to be all hip and trendy. This place is just a classic authentic pho restaurant, and no Bells and whistles."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pho whenever I'm in the Chinatown area. I find this to be the most authentic! Pho hung never disappoints me, the food is awesome. I came here yesterday and noticed they increased the prices, oh well it won't stop me from coming back! 

Please note this place takes cash only!"}
{"text":"When I walk into this place it looks exactly like the Chinese food places featured in Hollywood movies, you know the drill, badly decorated or mostly decorated with Christmas lights no matter the time of year but they pride themselves in their food. And they're always busy, which this place is throughout the day. 
I love it but not as much as my local pho hung, if it was closer to me I'd probably visit more. 

I wish they accepted visa/debit I don't usually carry cash and its a pain to have to look for an ATM and get charged the $3 dollar fee."}
{"text":"This place is not fine dining. This place is where you go if you want good pho fast and cheap. I think we had pho on the table in front of us within 10 minutes of walking in the door, with an app and a drink for under $25. 

The rare beef pho(02 on the menu) actually comes thin sliced and rare.

The service is the standard in Chinatown. If you don't mind waving or calling your server to you and asserting yourself then you will get what you want fast. They don't really hover nearby and try and predict your needs."}
{"text":"We came here at 10:15am on Monday 9/28/15. There were only 3,4 table with customers ( about 7 customers). The waitress acted as if she was so busy. She was bot friendly at all. She gave us 3 menu , paper and pencil to order. This is totally strange, because we have to order noodle in filling out paper. Only time we do it as dim sum.  We wait for a while when she back to get drink and puck up order. Foods were nasty taste. Chicken of pho is so plan. Congee smell full of vinegar. It was awful. It was bad experience of the day! Never we be back here."}
{"text":"Ok folks, most people have said that the service sucks. And it does. So if you go there, try not to care too much and just focus on the food and the awesome panoramic view of Chinatown that you can see from the south-facing side of the restaurant. Neat right? Just relax. People watch through the window and maybe eavesdrop on your neighbours 9the place is packed). Give in and accept that your server might be surly or inattentive or basically hustling you but whatever..  go on, order the pork cold rolls and wonton soup to start. That's it. 

The cold rolls are fresh and tasty.. nothing too great. There's some alright peanut sauce to dip them in. The pork inside is chewy in a good way. Nice contrast of texture and flavour to the mint and beansprouts. The soup is salty but the small size comes with about eight fat little shrimp and pork wontons. They're delicious and sumptuously addictive in a junk food kinda way. Fantastic! The broth is good and although its quite salty the cold rolls detract from that. Not bad.

Sometimes I have the pho and I find it satisfying but overall kinda salty and homogenous after I've had a few bites. The meat can be nice, depending which one you order. The rare beef pho is nice because the beef cooks in the broth. The curry chicken pho is surprisingly tasty, its worth a try.

I like the bun, but I also find it to be a bit bland and the meat of lower quality. Pork tends to be the best.. the one with three kinds of pork in particular. I wish that the buns that come with eggs were served with runny eggs so the yolk could blend into the dish but unfortunately they come with hard fried eggs that are haphazardly cooked.   

The portions are huge and the price is alright. If you sit by the window it can be pleasant. Overall the vegetables are fresh and the meat can be nice tasting, if a little low quality, but sometimes the broth tastes a bit.. like there are processed ingredients used in it. 

I love the lemongrass tofu over rice off the vegetarian menu. It consists of just tofu and onion but the spice paste its cooked in is really delicious. The menu offers a variety of fruit smoothies and I enjoy the mango one although sometimes the mangoes used are unripe and its kinda bitter.

One thing's for certain: if you like using a lot of condiments and garnishes, this is the place for you :D

I go here often because my white, yuppie parents really love it. That probably says something."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice for a pho place.  I ordered their special which is aptly numbered #1.  The wait was a bit longer  than other pho places and took around 5-7 minutes to come out.  What I really liked about this place was the amount of meat and noodles the give you.  I would say that the food portion is 20% bigger than other pho places for the same size and the meat is around 20-25% more.  In addition, this place is very clean and spacious and you don't feel cramped or rushed here.

Verdict: pho sure, wonder-pho place."}
{"text":"I've been here many times because people know the location and it's easy to find. It's hit or miss here. For example The last time I went I got the vermicelli and I wasn't impressed. It was super dry and the fish sauce was more bland than usual. Still great value, but some consistency there would be nice."}
{"text":"Finally! A place that serves just what I craved, done perfectly. Admission: I'm not a pho guy. I want barbecue pork on Vermicelli with spiced pork roll and spring roll. It was delicious. Copious. Flavourful. And on a bed of fresh crispy vegetables. 
The service was full of smiles and attentive. And it was cheap. $13 out the door. 
I love this spot. I'll be baaaaaaaack!"}
{"text":"Mostly going to reiterate what other's have said; good location, cheap, tasty and satisfying.

I met my friend here for dinner one night; hungry and in need of cheap eats. My friend frequents this place as she feels it is the best place for Pho on Spadina. We are both Gluten free and there are plenty of options on the menu to cater for this dietary need. My friend had the soup and I had a the beef stir fry.

Service is super fast and the food was steaming hot, the portions are big (even when ordering a small!)

Decor - typical to most places in china town, and it was clean. Good sized restaurant with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This place is not good like it used to be.

Years ago, I used to live in downtown and this used to be one of my favorite regular pho joint. Other ones I frequented was Pho88 just down the street on Spadina, and Pho Linh which is a bit further down west end on College Street.


Today, I ordered pho with rare beef, tripe and tendon in small size, for $6.25

I usually prefer and order rare beef because it will be cooked just perfect and tender within 1 min of the bowl arriving in front of me. Cooked beef will be too well done and tough for my taste.

However, the problem with the rare beef in my bowl was it never turned color, even 5 minutes of being in the bowl. The soup seems hot, but apparently not hot enough.

The tripe was alright but the tendon pieces, though large, was super bland.

Flavor of the soup, just tastes like something is missing. Not good like I remembered it to be like 10 years ago.

There wasn't enough noodles in my bowl either. I know I ordered small but I still expected a fair amount to fill out that 'small' bowl. Instead, I feel like I got a sample of noodles, and this makes me feel cheated even more because rice noodle is definitely not an expensive ingredient, and at $6.25 for a small bowl ($7.00 for small house pho), the restaurant was being quite stingy.

I live in Scarborough and maybe I've been spoiled by the many other pho joints in that part of town. Definitely got more for the price there.


Won't be coming back to this place for pho even if I'm down here again.


Oh, now I regret even tipping them after reading review from Maggie that the owner pocket the tips."}
{"text":"Worst pho place ever. I come from America and I was extremely disappointed on how Canadian service are. By the way they put us by the door because we had a child, how rude is that. No refill on drinks, pho noodles taste like the one in the package. It was expensive and horrible ever. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Sorry but not sorry."}
{"text":"If it wouldn't end up with me being covered in soup, and if it were actually physically possible - I would hug and kiss Pho Hung and never let him (it) out of my sight...or my tummy. 

Pho Hung is an amazing Vietnamese place. As soon as I saw my meal I began salivating and my taste buds just knew they had hit the mother-load! 

My boyfriend had the pho, which he said was great, but I prefer his own homemade...I ordered beef vermicelli (Large is $9.00 Small is $7.00). This was no ordinary vermicelli though. They make it above and beyond other mortal noodle bowls by infusing lemongrass, and other fresh herbs. Their fish sauce also has a perfect ratio of garlic and chili seeds. 

Free jasmine tea is a nice treat too, I find not too many restaurants do this in TO but I appreciate it! 

This restaurant is a perfect alternative to a heavy dim-sum. Nice light, flavorful, cheap, and the wall of windows makes it a great people watching spot! Heh heh heh."}
{"text":"What the pho? This is terrible pho. The pho is so bland. I fetl like eating meat and tap water. I guess they are busy and they just watered down their pho broth. Meat doesnt look or tasted too fresh. What a waste of time. All of us hated it and could not continue on eating. We just pay and leave. Staff seems overwork and stressed. This is will first and last time coming here."}
{"text":"Cash Only = Minus 1 star 

We we're there on a Wednesday, early part of the night and the place was still brimmed with patrons. 

The original pho is colloquially good with expected convenance of sweet basils, lime wedges and bean sprouts being served ahead. The broth is the heart of the meal as anything else, noodles, meat and garnishes are secondary appendages. It's in need of a bit more salt, I think? 

Bah! What do I know. Its a good eat anyway."}
{"text":"My explanation for the two stars. Read on. Food is good. Pho, vermicelli, rice and meat. Decor is good but here is the problem. Service.... Its bad. I find staff rude, no manners, no appreciation for regular customers. They don't accept debit or credit under $10. So carry cash with you if your going alone. They will argue with you and don't really care if the customer says \"I am sorry I will not be coming back to your restaurant anymore\" due to their poor customer service. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Being from the burbs I was spoiled with the abundance of Pho, so I wasn't overwhelmed by the pho here. That's not to say it's not good, it's actually quite good, just a bit pricier than the joints outside the city, but then again everything costs more in the city. 

In terms of service, I had a case of lost in translation with the wait staff here. I was trying to ask what was in their #13 soup and had the waiter mumble something then walk away from me, twice. 

Great place in Chinatown if you're craving some pho. Unfortunately they only accept cash, so make sure you visit a bank beforehand to avoid paying ATM fees."}
{"text":"The food is okay. They simple don't take any debit or credit cards just to hide their income and pay less taxes. We really all should avoid any places don't take card payments."}
{"text":"I have visited this Pho restaurant over three times in the past few weeks. The reason why I keep coming back is their food is good, service is fast, restaurant is big, and price is decent! We also tend to come here when other places nearby are too packed (such as dumplings or dim sum) because there is usually no wait. 

FOOD: I have tried their pho noodle soup with beef + other beef parts, bun bo hue, beef satay soup noodles, and congee (yes they have congee). All their food has been good, and portions are generous. Soups are all very fragrant and flavorful without being too salty or tasting like overload of MSG. Meat has been fairly consistent, not the best but pretty good. The congee was surprisingly appetizing, and comes in a very very large bowl. It is slightly pricier than the noodle soups. 

DRINKS: Their fruit smoothies are decent. I've also had their Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk over ice. It was the standard but slightly pricey will probably not get next time.

SERVICE: Their service is very efficient, although maybe not the friendliest. Not that I mind since when I go there I just want good food fast. The owners/managers can be seen waiting on tables. 

Will definitely go back when I'm in need of something good to fill me up ASAP!"}
{"text":"Way too much MSG and I had to lie on the floor for 40 mins... So much pain. If you're sensitive to MSG don't go here."}
{"text":"Pho Hung's been a Toronto staple for Vietnamese food.  Not much has changed over the years.  The service is still bad, the food is thoroughly average and it's still pretty busy.  The food comes our fairly quickly but sometimes getting the waiter's attention can be a challenge.

The pho is pretty standard.  Compared with some of the other places I've been to, the noodles were a bit softer and the meat wasn't as plentiful.  Still, it's not bad.  The hoisin sauce was a bit suspect as it was notably less viscous than what I'm used to.

Bottom Line:  Busy pho place, OK prices and mediocre service.  There are better places in Chinatown that will also accept debit/credit to boot."}
{"text":"About as simple as Vietnamese dining gets. You sit down, there's a piece of paper, you flip through the menu and decide what you want, you write that number on the piece of paper, boom. The waiter/waitress won't even come over until you have menu closed. Tea is served complimentary and the food is brought to you quickly. I had the chicken curry and a jackfruit shake. SO GOOD. This place is awesome, just keep in mind they only take cash. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The portion is huge for their pho here, but the broth can be inconsistent (some days it is not as fresh as others). Still, it's always better than most other places. Avoid the spicy sate broth because it is very oily. Also, outside of the spring rolls, I would not recommend ordering their non-pho items: the stir-fried dishes and dried vermicelli (bun) are boring and not their specialty. Stick to the pho all the way. As for the service, it's pretty much deliver-and-done."}
{"text":"They have some of the BEST PHO (after my mom's) in Toronto.  I've never been disappointed in their portions and the quality of their broth is pretty damned good.

The price is definitely competitive in this over saturated market, but so as long as they continue what they're doing, they'll maintain their position as one of the leaders of Vietnamese cuisine in Toronto.

It's just too bad that they're not open late to cater to the late-night or clubbing crowd..."}
{"text":"I used to come to Pho Hung a lot when I was a kid with my parents and it's sad to see how bad the service became. 

Upon arriving you're welcomed by all the recognition they've received on the door which makes you think things are going to be great. 

We were asked by 3 different people how many people were in my group, two kinda asked and walked away but one actually cleaned up a table to seat us. 

I got the bun thit nuong, nem nuong, and cha gio. The dish was okay, I didn't like the thit nuong because all I tasted was bare lemon grass and it was in big chunks that wasn't really appetizing. The nem nuong was overly charred. The thing I liked the most was the cha gio. I really appreciate how the nuoc mam came in a self serve bottle because I eat a lot of it so I didn't need to keep asking for more. 

I found it weird how on the menu it says you cannot take home your leftovers and the prices were really high. 

This used to be really family oriented and homey type of pho restaurant but now they don't seem to really care about their service as long as you get what you want and leave."}
{"text":"SERVICE. Service is absolutely terrible here. Probably one of the worst that I have seen if you can even classify that as service. I don't think that they understand that giving a pleasant experience for customer is an essential to a food business. Especially for sit in restaurants. They did not make a single eye contact. They gazed far away even when we were asking for something. They might as well just have self serve and the place would be much pleasant. 

Also, if they are that rude to the customers, the food should have at least been decent. First of all they don't even give equal portion. For the same food that me and my friend ordered, she got about half the portion of noodle that I got. Not to mention the clump of beef that was all jumbled together. I could clearly see that they did not care about the dish that they served us. The taste isn't even that great. I have been to many many restaurants that taste much better. Having great food should never be an excuse for bad service but they don't even manage to do that. 

Overall, I am never coming back to the place. There are so many decent restaurants that are around the area and this does not even come close to any of them."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't get the hype. Everything was just ok. I hate the style of service with 20 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Today for example, in one meal, I was served by five different people. Never the same one twice. I'd be more content if a server were just assigned to the section so I can get attention and know who I am tipping (although I've read tipping here is a scam).

When it comes to the pho I've had better just about everywhere else. Barely a taste of spice in the broth. I got exactly two small pieces of rare beef today. Brisket was beyond fatty, like entirely fat and connective tissue, not worth eating. The only saving grace about the meal is that the durian smoothie was delicious. But lets be honest, I'd eat durian out of a garbage can, so that's hard to screw up for me. 

While the price is right here, I'd rather spend my time and money in a place with better ambiance and better food for a dollar more."}
{"text":"My Dearest Pho Hung, 
Goodness, here I am again, to continue my ongoing love affair with the large #2.  A giant bowl of piping hot broth, thinly sliced beef, an assortment of green onion, and in general, worldly goodness.  Each and every time, outstanding.  The spouts are always fresh (no one likes a limp bean sprout), and the basil adds to the enjoyment of the dish.   All of this for a measly $7.25?  I'm in.   I love this joint.
  As a finishing note, I noticed a fairly large gentleman across the room, standing up upon finishing his meal.  He was casually smoothing his hands over his rotund soup belly, smiling with satisfaction.  I nodded - yes, friend, I too, feel the same way."}
{"text":"Although the food is OK, the consistently rude inattentive service here is a dealbreaker."}
{"text":"Pho Hung is a Toronto classic. I've eaten here for about ten years, and had reliably delicious meals throughout. There used to be an outside patio, but about six years ago they extended the building to use they space. They are typically packed! Competition is still in the Spadina/Dundas Chinatown strip, and many restaurants are empty...so you can see that the locals vote with their feet. And Pho Hung is slightly more expensive than its neighbors, so their success should be even more impressive.

You order here by writing down your selections on a piece of paper. Actually, this is done at a lot of places in the area, and makes for fast service without a language barrier (not all the waiters speak english or french). You can also show up with a reasonably large group (say 6), and the owner will shuffle people around to make room.

Standards are #3 (a pho), #19A (\"bun\"=rice vermicelli noodes with spring rolls), and 30 (may have the # wrong: curry rice w/chicken). They have a vegetarian section of the menu with about 15 items: I often have the curry tofu. The #83 iced vietnamese coffee is great. Just be warned you'll have to be patient because it drip-brews in front of you, which takes about 10 minutes.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is similar to the review I gave for the Annex location....

Firstly, I lived in Vietnam in 2003-2004 and am familiar with all types of Vietnamese cuisine (I make my own and go out to eat Viet at least 1-2 times a week).  This is perhaps the most overrated Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto.  The portions are smaller and costs more than at other restaurants.  I paid $9 for a bowl of noodles on Spadina (pho bo kho).  That is simply outrageous.

The menu is vast, as it is at most Vietnamese restaurants.  Normally very busy and loud.  Service is typical of this type of food genre.

The Pho - broth is very good, though fresh noodles are not used.  The portion size is smaller here than at most Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.  The \"Choo Choo Train\" (Xe Lua) on Spadina and others in Old Chinatown serve fresh noodles -- both are better options.

The Fish Sauce (which is served with everything not labeled 'pho')- not strong enough in my opinion, seems diluted -- as is the hoisin sauce.

There are a number of better places on Spadina/Dundas (Xe Lua, even Pho Pasteur), though if you are on Bloor, it may be the only option for pho."}
{"text":"Staff spilled the soup, no apologies after waiting 20 mins for service.
Weather was cold so my boyfriend and I went into get some hot soup. Took forever for the waitresses to notice that we didnt habe any tea or water. We asked 5 workers passing by before one actually brought us a kettle. After that it took another 10 minutes for someone to come and take our order. Once they finally took our order, they brought my meal but not my boyfriend's. After another 10 mins, we asked the waitress, she went to the back and came back with his soup amd slammed it on the table and soup spilled all over the table. No apologies or any reaction from the staff.
Not a place to goto unless you really dont care for the service."}
{"text":"No thanks. We were in a bit of a hurry so couldn't wait the long lines at Kensington market staple spots, so this was the first place that we passed that wasn't closed in the middle of lunch hour on Spadina, good rating on here and pretty packed, so we went.

Immediately didn't feel the vibe at all, 0 customer service, not even a \"Hello\", not a word from our server. 

Didn't get the Pho, I wanted something crunchier, went with \"Number 16\", they spicy pork / sausage. My friend had the assorted noodles. After almost 25 minutes food finally came, to our surprise it was definitely not fresh, except for the greasy spring roll. My friend couldn't even eat his, they took it away, still charged full price. Mine the lettuce on the bottom had a nasty fridge taste to it. Couldn't finish it either. 

After paying they automatically added themselves a tip, giving back like $3 less than what the bill was. Fine, we just left and staying far away from that place.

Even if the Pho here is good according to other reviews (and nothing else here is, in my opinion), there are plenty of other places to go where the services isn't worth negative points."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I heard about this place since it was listed as one of the best Vietnamese places in Toronto. I decided to bookmark the place since the price looked reasonable and got OK ratings. I got the pho with semi-cooked beef with beef meatballs. I thought the pho was OK and it's probably not the best pho in the world. I have experienced much more delicious pho at other places. My boyfriend got the vermicelli noodles and he said he enjoyed it.

The service could HAVE BEEN a lot better tho. We were out-of-towners and we didn't know we had to got down what we wanted on the piece of paper. It took us awhile to flag down a waitress. The staff weren't friendly as well. It wasn't a great experience for us that day."}
{"text":"Attente de 10 minutes à l'arrivée, mais pour un WE ca va, et ca prouve que les gens aiment ce restaurant!

La carte est complète, juste un manque dans le choix des nems, et c'est dommage, surtout pour un viet! Le service était parfait, rapide, serveurs toujours présents quand on en a besoin! 
De plus les prix sont très raisonnables!

A essayer: les rouleaux de printemps à faire soi même, c'est super sympa!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people complained about the food. This pho I had although I only had it once, was pretty f****ing awesome."}
{"text":"Opens earlier than all the other options. If you're looking for a meal before 11:30 am, this is the place to go. The serving's very generous and the price very cheap. The service is A-OK but not great. It tends to get exceptionally busy around lunch time so be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to be in Toronto with an abundance of Vietnamese food choices we picked this place because it had decent reviews and was well situated. After reading the reviews on Vietnamese places in town there wasn't a single one that didn't include \"my fave pho in town\" and \"I don't know why anyone likes this place\" - so a crapshoot really. We came during a busy lunchtime and the servers seemed to think that everyone there knew the score - since they didn't say \"fill this out\" when they left a blank check and pen at our table. Also the water could have been filled a little more regularly. At any rate the food was okay and certainly filled my craving so we were satisfied. The Kensington neighborhood is great fun and we had an awesome walk after our meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho! The large was a very good size. My husband had the bun reau and he enjoyed it. The fresh shrimp rolls were good, but the shredded pork rolls were delicious! We each had a shake (durian and mango) and both were tasty, and also a generous size for the price. Overall good quality food for a very reasonable price. Service was ok (servers weren't overly attentive but were there when you needed something). My husband also chatted a bit with the owner and he was delightful."}
{"text":"I visited this Pho Hung a while ago and I thought that the Pho wasn't all that great. The meal was served hot and vegetables were fresh and that is pretty important but when you have a bowl a pho the most important is the broth. I tried the Pho Bo (beef) and the Pho Ga (chicken) and I found that both of the broths tasted watered down which ruined the meal because you want the bold and rich flavor. Maybe I just came on a bad day, but I am always willing to give a business a second chance"}
{"text":"A popular pho placed located in downtown Chinatown. Usually quite packed here especially during lunch and in the evenings. I came here with a friend for lunch and ordered the 101 special large with beef tripe, brisket and beef balls. The broth is always amazing even though its basically MSG but still delicious!! For the size and the amount of noodles and meat for $8.50, it's a pretty good deal. Food came out quickly. We also ordered the Fried Spring Rolls to share. Good amount for $4.50 as you get large spring rolls. They were nice, hot and delicious! Pho is the best comfort food. Love coming here for lunch and enjoying a delicious bowl. Overall, love coming here all the time for pho. One of the better pho places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Fast service. 
- Reasonably priced.
- Delicious milkshakes!
- The broth is amazing, especially for the beef pho (which I highly recommend). 

Cons:
- Servers can be a bit standoffish and rude...but then again, what do you expect out of a Pho restaurant?"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to eat some pho as this used to be one of my regular spots and was absolutely shocked by the horrible service.  

Waiter kept bumping the table, forgot parts of my order, and when I flagged her down to grab a spoon and a pair of chopsticks for my friend she put her palm to my face as she walked by.  She forgot simple things like a glass of water as well. 

When I left my payment she didn't return the change to the table so I had to stand at the checkout counter to get it back.  Owner asked if there was anything wrong and I said that it was legitimately the worst service I've ever had here. He shrugged and did not apologize. 

Other tables were having issues too, waving down staff for things such as napkins or to speak with their server about how they did not receive what they had ordered.  One table ordered vermicelli with mixed vegetables and there were no mixed vegetables in the bowl. The owner pointed to the lettuce and said \"that is a vegetable.\"   

For the horrible service it isn't worth it to come back here. Pho Linh may be a trek, but at least they don't treat their customers like garbage."}
{"text":"To call Pho Hung \"merely average\" might extend it even more respect than it is due. The Pho Tai was fatty, the spring rolls were oily and barely warm, and the tea was downright cold. What truly ruins one's experience at this restaurant, however, is that the staff begin cleaning around you and stacking chairs all around your table, half an hour before they are even supposed to close. We arrived at 9:00 (a full hour before closing) but by 9:30 every table on all sides of ours had chairs stacked and teetering over us--even though we and a few other unlucky patrons were still eating. If the Pho was great I'd go back anyways, but the food is mediocre--so why bother? (Unless of course you are the litigious type, in which case you have a ripe opportunity for a personal injury claim.)"}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 7.5/10

Service: 8/10
Value: 6/10
Hygiene: 6/10
Aesthetics: 6/10

We came here around 8 on a Friday night looking for something to satisfy our appetites. After looking at a few reviews in the area we decided on this place. 

The house special pho had a flavourful broth, it was very light and free of heavy MSG flavour. However, the large order had about 5 slices of beef, about 10 items of beef in total. For the cost and it being a 'large', my expectations were definitely not met. The avocado shake was great and flavourful, a little heavy on the sugar though.

The cost is typical of Vietnamese food around $8-10/entree. The value of the portions is a bit of a letdown. 

It has a very typical vietnamese restaurant feel. There is a lot of tables, so finding a spot isn't too big an issue. The floors are a bit greasy, so be careful not to slip. 

The service here was very friendly and they were attentive and prompt. 

A reasonable place for Vietnamese food, and the flavours are great. It's not a bad place, but I can definitely think of a few other places to go."}
{"text":"Over all an average experience. Their peanut sauce had a hint of something I dont recognize, but still good. The broth of the pho was really tasty, but my usual fare gives me more meat and noodles for a lesser price. Though I do like that they offer a lot of appetizers."}
{"text":"This place is a bit off the beaten off but well worth it. When you walk in on a late afternoon and you see the owner shredding the green onion by hand, you know this place is serious. 

Portions are generous, pho is well-portioned with good amount of fixings. The broth is a bit more clear, lacking some of the greasy goodness but refreshing.

I'd be back next time I'm up this way."}
{"text":"Can't beat a large bowl of tasty pho on a cold windy day, but everything else has to be right of course. This place is large and clean for a pho restaurant and someone commented on the cleanest restroom...quite right on that. I placed the order before I went downstairs to the restroom. My house special got served up right after I came up.  Granted it was a late lunch, but that is fast service. The pho was a generous serving of meat and noodles. The flavor of the broth was outstanding!

The only complaint is the stupid rule of credit card for $10 and above. My pho cost $9.05. Not that I am complaining about 95 cents, but seriously, the credit card merchant's charge is the cost of doing business. I explained to the woman owner that I am from the US and only in town for 2 days on business, so I don't have Canadian money. She took my card and swiped it for $10! I tipped my waiter $2 anyhow."}
{"text":"If you enjoy your vermicelli with nuoc mum that has the flavor profile of plain water, you'll love it here"}
{"text":"Our current go to for Vietnamese food. My standard grilled pork chop with rice always satisfies. First time my pork chop had no bone which was a bonus. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Legit China Town Food at good prices, with Fresh Ingredients and at decent prices.

Excellent Pho, Congee and Food.  Have come here many times during my years of living in and around Toronto.  Really pretty much everything you try here is good (never had a bad experience).

Serving can be a bit spotty (but that is expected in China Town....the good places get so busy it is a case of wait for table - order food - eat food - pay bill - get out...then NEXT...and the cycle continues)

So would require waiting for a table  during the weekends especially (but hey that is how you also know the place has great food).  

Mixed bag of people eat here: mainly locals and students etc - with a smattering of tourists.  Good place to go if you are in the China Town and Kensington Market area and want to grab good food at a good pricepoint."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I have ever had in Toronto. Their broth is so good, meat is always fresh and tasted rich. Reasonable price and very quick service. Love it."}
{"text":"2.5 over 5.

I like the service here. Staff try. Perhaps this is due to the predominantly non-Vietnamese crowd.
Over the last 20 yrs., this place consistently serves average bowls of Pho.

However, bun (vermicelli) & rice dishes, shakes and desserts are below-average. The ingredients are there but the flavours cater to a Canadian clientele.
If you like it, you need to try others."}
{"text":"Came here the other day. Pho was fantastic. Great taste, great portion size for the price. 

Ps: everyone seems to complain about the lack of cleanliness. I didn't notice this at all, and kinda enjoyed the ambiance in this place. I wonder if maybe some of the other reviewers haven't been to Chinatown often enough, or perhaps I was just too engrossed in conversation to notice?"}
{"text":"My uncle took me to this place and I wanted to see how the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) does in terms of Vietnamese food. I was not in the mod for Pho since it was Summer time. He already ate, but wanted to get some some Vietnamese coffee and he usually likes the coffee they serve. Here is what I ordered: 

#63 Goi Cuon: Cold Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Vegetables. Ordered 2 pieces. $3.75 CAD.

#17 Bun Nem Nuong, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio - This is Grilled Pork, Spiced Grilled Pork Roll, Spring Roll with Vermicelli and Vegetables. $7.50 CAD for the small. 

The Goi Cuon was decent and tasty. The peanut sauce had some spice in it, putting some flair in the flavour. The shrimp inside had some freshness. Two pieces can make a really filling snack for a couple of hours.

As for the Vermicelli I had, it was heartily filling and tasty, especially after eating one spring roll before getting into the bowl.  The fried spring roll inside the bowl was probably the tastiest spring roll I had at a Vietnamese restaurant so far for some reason. The outside shell was not too thin, had the right amount of crispiness, not hard to chew and the inside was soft and tasty. The Nem Nuong (spiced grilled pork roll) and the Thit Nuong (grilled pork) were also deliciously good, fresh out of the stove, and made the cold noodles warmer. Noodles and vegetables were fresh, and the spearmint along with the peanut crumbs just made the dish one of the most delicious Vermicelli dishes I have eaten in the Toronto area so far. 

Interior is spacious compared to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants that I have been to in Boston's Chinatown, and the washroom was almost as clean compared to a hotel washroom. This is probably the Vietnamese restaurant with the cleanest washroom that I have been to so far. Overall, this is probably the nicest and one of the biggest Vietnamese restaurants and I thought I had one of the best vermicelli noodles in the Toronto area so far. I would like to come back again to see how they do in Pho, if the temperature in the Toronto area is less than 18 degrees Celsius."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????HUNG,???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Tried their special #1 pho. It was okay, nothing special. Very minimal basil and things like green onion whites are so big it's inedible. Enough to satisfy the intense pho craving though. Service is typical of Chinatown. Also, this place doesn't allow sharing, don't know if this is typical for places that are not all you can eat."}
{"text":"My usual go-to place for Vietnamese food for years.
Prices are reasonable and the service is quite good/efficient.

Regarding the pho, the broth is tasty, despite knowing that there is MSG in it. The beef is quite chewy and hard to eat, even when cooked from rare.

I do enjoy the other options (rice, vermicelli) whenever I'm craving. 
The dishes are huge and I'm usually bloated whenever I leave."}
{"text":"First time I went there I thought Pho was amazing, but I did not like it a bit when the waiter mention that we have to leave because they only aloud people to stay 30 mins in rush hour :S.
We went a couple of times after but the broth was super greasy still tasted good, not even 10 minutes enjoying our soup, when the owner comes and drops the bill un our table, wtf? What if we wanted to order more. 
Definately not going back!"}
{"text":"Convenient location right near spadina and dundas. Very crowded here but you don't have to wait too long. Food comes pretty fast. Despite the business, My order came within 7 minutes (Also the fact that its not hard to plate some noodles in a bowl I guess). I ordered the beef spring roll vermicelli bowl and portion size is great. A small of anything really fills you up. You could order XL pho and share with 3 people. The avocado smoothies are delicious here and can be quite filling so only order it if you come starving!

The only downside here is that it accepts cash only but there is an ATM downstairs if you need to get cash."}
{"text":"It's typical Vietnamese comfort food with large portions and speedy service. People typically finish their meals in 30-40 minutes or get take out and it's a quick sit down place. Most people order pho, although there are other soup and curry options. Decor and service aren't outstanding, but you don't come here for either of those."}
{"text":"Asian Comfort Food before a long trip.  
Tom's Law: Don't eat Chinese food where Chinese do not live.  I find that true with Vietnamese and other ethnic foods too. (The reason is that the recipes tend to be less authentic - to compromise for local taste buds.)
To fortify for my trip to Geneva today, i had my final meal in Toronto here.
Ordered the Pho Beef noodle special #1 small - It has all the different cuts from the usual flank, sirloin (rare and cooked) etc to the exotics like tendon and omasum (my favourite).  Soup is clear and flavourful, with hints of spice - I drained it. Sides of Basil and Raw bean sprouts accentuates the spring freshness. 
Spicy Mango salad - Mango, Red onions, red and green peppers, other veggies tossed in a fish sauce vinaigrette and topped with cashews and fried garlic. This is the Best version of this dish in Toronto and Vancouver. A must have.
Surprisingly the establishment is quite clean, being situated in Chinatown.  Everything is prepared with passion.
Unfortunately, service is also genuine to the Chinatown experience - abrupt, forgetful and sometimes clumsy.
Overall, the palate wins.  This place is a golden and will keep me returning."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. As a Vietnamese person I feel like I'm allowed to claim extra credibility too! While I agree with previous yelpers that the service isn't particularly friendly, they are efficient. This is not a fine-dining restaurant by any means but rather a quick bite to eat. It's noisy, cramped, and a bit messy. Despite all of this, the awesome food makes up for everything! 

Do yourself a favour and get the Banh Xeo (kind of like a Vietnamese quesadilla) or the Bun with grilled pork and seasoned pork. And the spring rolls, which are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Mississauga! I've been to at least 20 different Vietnamese noodle soup restaurants in the GTA and this one takes the cake, or should I say takes the pho! 

Rich and flavourful broth, noodles cooked to perfection, and the meat! The quality of the meat is really good and the portion size is ridiculous, I mean pho hung must be losing money all the meat they put into there pho.

May I also suggest the deep friend spring rolls or the cold spring rolls if you're on a health kick. 


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great pho, large portions and excellent prices.  My favorite is the beef brisket, beef tendon pho.  Sooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ate here this morning. Went to the bathroom after. Washed my hands and a live cockroach was in the sink. Reported to public health."}
{"text":"###We Both got food poisoning #####


If I could give this place zero stars I would we just ate there my girlfriend is throwing up Called  to tell the restaurant and she was just rude and said it was not her food. 
Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Love the fish stew! It's one of the few Vietnamese restaurants that offer this traditional dish, and it's very flavourful.

If you like hot and sour soups, try their hot and sour soup (comes with either fish or chicken). I tried it with the fish. It has lots of vegetables and big pieces of fish. Good enough to share over a bowl of white rice or other dishes."}
{"text":"&)(Q*#%$*(Q^#%*(&^ YES YES YESSSS. Their Pho is unbelivable.

Menu is too big, too many choices and too hard to understand what is going on. I always get the deep fried spring rolls (4) and Pho of some sort. Usually the XL size, cuz come on... tis me. 

This time around I got the PHO CHÍN NAC - Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Well done). The XL was $8.75... and it was enough to feed a family. They bring you basil, sprouts and lime and then you add all kinds of sauce and enjoy the hell out of this bowl of love. 

Will come back here every single time I'm in the area. A few times I have actually thought of coming from North York just to get some Pho...

Definitely recommend. Service was lovely too, super fast on a Wednesday night post-AGO. Cuz imma hipster. 

xo"}
{"text":"Overall nice food and good service but they accept cash only,don't forget to order their shakes and pho delicious too"}
{"text":"This time was the second time I have been here.  The first time I had the pho with rare beef, well done beef and tripe - eww.  eww and weird.  But actually not that bad tasting; whether I would order it again in the same incarnation, I doubt it.  This time around, we came in after a night at the AGO and after this season's first real snowfall, so we were aching for a good pho.  This time I had the one with rare beef and brisket.  Better choice.  The broth was so rich in flavour, the meat was tender and fatty (the fatty part kinda irked me a bit but I looked straight ahead and ate it anyway.)  That soup coupled with the fresh basil, sprouts and sauces provided made for a great way to warm up. While we were slurping those up, (they came to the table almost immediately), the spring rolls arrived - perhaps the best I have ever tasted.  For real.  So goddamn crunchy!  And filled with noodles and stuff!  And greasy the way it should be!  Finally we chose to be adventurous and got this pan-cake with shrimp and pork.  I don't think it was quite what we had imagined.  It was some kind of omelette that had periodic shrimps and a piece of fried pork or two.  (i literally got a hold of one measly piece of pig).  The consistency of the egg was kind of mealy and crispy and (don't know why different rules apply here, but they do) too greasy.  It was also filled with bean sprouts.  We did manage to finish off most of it, but I wouldn't order that again.  

The weirdest thing happened at the end of the meal, though.  We over ordered by ordering the large soups (at 8 bucks - a steal) and I was trying to temper myself, so I left some beefy, soupy goodness in the bowl to take home;  my friend was even silly enough to give me the rest of her unfinished soup so the booty would have been that much more great.  But when I asked the waiter to pack it up he said that they didn't allow their customers to take leftover soup home with them.  I asked him why and he intimated that some folks had gotten sick from the soup after it was no longer hot and/or when they ate it at home.  What the H?  I can't say I felt wonderful right then, after having just wolfed down most of that bowl and at the same time I was pissed that I didn't finish all my beef.   Strange.  Anyhow, I'd still go there again, just keep that in mind when you go."}
{"text":"We browsed Yelp for Pho options before deciding on eating at Pho Hung. I was surprised that it was busy during lunch on a Monday.

For appetizers, we shared a Cha Gio (#26), which consisted of two deep fried spring rolls filled with minced meat and vegetables. It was served with fish sauce over a bed of lettuce with pickled carrot and radish. We liked how the wrapping was crispy.

My brother ordered an Avocado Milkshake (#105) and a small bowl of Pho Ga (#12). He liked how the Avocado Milkshake had a strong avocado flavor. 

My mother ordered a Fish Congee, which was a bit on the bland side.

My father and I ordered a small bowl of Pho Hung Dac Biet, which consisted of beef rice noodle soup. There were multiple kinds of beef including rare, well done, tripe, and tendon. It was pholicious!"}
{"text":"OMG yum! Was craving Pho for so long and found this little place in Chinatown. I love that they have a seperate vegetarian menu for me to chose from so I decided to get the vermicelli instead. 

I honestly was not expecting it to be so good. It had a slightly smoky flavour that I've never tasted before and it was delicious! Love the food. Service could be better but I expected lower service anyway. The food came out quickly and our bill came quick too! 

Could be a little cleaner though, tables were kind of sticky"}
{"text":"I only tried their beef pho and boy was it way too salty. There soup base is basically salt and msg, not sure if they even use real cow bone to make the soup. At the end I had to pour tea into my noodle to make it less salty.
I have been to many pho places and this is one of the worst I tried.

There service was mediocre, the waiter keeps forgetting to bring me tea."}
{"text":"I have only recently been coming to Pho Hung regularly. I have to say that the previous positive reviews were accurate. Pho Hung provides a steady, go-to place in Chinatown for an delicious, affordable meal. I usually order their house special pho, which is always delicious, though the portion is a bit smaller than its competitors. Having said this, Pho Hung has not disappointed. Its location on Spadina Avenue makes it easily accessible and it is within walking distance from Queen Street West and Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Portions are small. They confuse orders a lot. Owner is rude and always gives off the vibe that she can't be bothered. I think that this might've been caused by the fact that they used to get a lot of traffic and they can get away with shitty service, but if they are smart enough, they will realise that it could end up being their demise, as it catches up to them."}
{"text":"Been here 4 or 5 times in the past 3 years.
I've only ever ordered the pho here (rare and well done beef XL).  Actually only ever order the pho anywhere.
Pho was good enough to keep me coming back, but more because of location.  I've driven shamefully long distances for a hot bowl of pho, but come here because it's close to work.
Decor is just what you'd expect from a clean, but authentic asian restaurant.
Service was relatively speedy but don't expect eye contact (doesn't bother me at vietnamese restaurants though).
I'd say one of the better places in the area and I will come back."}
{"text":"Nice \"pho\" soup here, the noodle is not as fresh and soft as Pho Xe lua but still fine for us. They also have good \"bun mam\" and \"pho bo kho\". Service is ok."}
{"text":"This Restaurant Accepts Cash Only but...

A friend took me here one night about an hour before the place was closing its operations. The Vietnamese food here is comforting and no-fuss and the flavors are good. I liked my \"bun\" noodle bowl which was filling with the vegetable garnishes hidden underneath with the noodles and meat stacked on top. It was almost like an upside-down noodle bowl with some nutritious treasures underneath :-) I haven't had Vietnamese food in a long time so the presentation of the bun was an interesting to see."}
{"text":"I've ate here many times and by far the best quality is the insanely cheap prices. Though with it being Chinatown you have to wonder if the inexpensive dishes are a result of low-quality food. Regardless I enjoy eating here and find the atmosphere to be pleasant. The food arrives quickly and I have never spent more than 20 bucks (including tip). Oh, and the Vietnamese ice coffee is a must! Many of my friends eat here as well, so that confirms for me that this is place to be if stuck in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad today at around 11:30AM. I was always curious as to how great this restaurant is, considering it's been around for quite sometime and I would always walk by it whenever I go grocery shopping in Chinatown. 

We were seated in the porch area and it took us a while for a server to get our order. I'd say from the time we were ready to give our order sheet to the time we got our food was about 25 minutes. 

My dad and I got the small house special pho. The pho soup tasted OK and there was quite a bit of rare beef on top. I had to quickly flip it over for the soup to cook, however even after being simmer in it for 15 minutes the meat never fully cooked. It might have been my particular case that this happened, but I could see why numerous yelpers have complained about feeling sick. It was $8 per bowl and to be honest with you... it wasn't worth the price. 

Some tips id like to give:
- they only accept cash
- they charge per person if dishes are split
- order the well-done pho to avoid the abundance of raw meat"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was very good! Got their small house pho special and it was more than enough for me for a lunch meal. Will come back later for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why I haven't reviewed this place before because I've eaten here at least 20 times. Mainly due to it's handy location. 

Anyway, 3.5 stars for Pho Hung. They serve up a decent pho, I usually get the pho ga (chicken). 

It's basically your run-of-the-mill Vietnamese joint - fast service, cheap prices (most meals under $10), large menu of pho, bun (vermicelli) and com (rice) dishes. 

I rarely go here anymore simply because the menu doesn't excite me, but it's a decent lunch spot."}
{"text":"The order: wonton soup with egg noodles for $7.50. The verdict: seriously delicious!! 

And I'm not usually one to lavish praise on Vietnamese soup places, simply because they all usually taste similar to me (is that racist?). But this soup stood out...the broth was nicely seasoned (addictively salty) and flavourful, and the wonton dumplings were done to perfection.

My dining companion (who, when I commented that the restaurant was smelly when we first walked in, said \"oh that's a good sign!\" lol) also thoroughly enjoyed his pho.

On a Monday night at 9:30 the place was super busy and I can see why.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"In my mind, this is the place to be for cheap yet delicious Pho. I don't go for the lousy service - I go for the wonderful Pho that never fails to satisfy my stomach. The Pho that is completely digested on my walk home that, half way to my house I have the urge to go back there for some more sort of Pho. No other Pho does that for me.
Springs rolls are delicious. One day I want to try the thing where you make your own cold spring rolls, but each time I am there - I order Pho out of instinct. 
This is not the place for you btw, if you're expecting some sort of service - it's not very good - more than once I have been tempted to walk out on the bill because they just don't come to check on you - never have because I plan to return to the place. For a great bowl of Ptho though, this is definitely THE place to be."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday.  The place was busy.  I ordered the #18 large $10. Grill pork, vermicelli, spring roll & vegetables.  The bowl was pretty large, the portion was a good size.  The spring roll was small size, not the larger size.  The flavour was ok.  I had better at other places.  We asked for separate bills but they gave us one bill with tip included.  Also, they didn't bring back the change.  That is not good.  Probably won't be back.  They asked us to leave because they needed the table."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food. I must have eaten at this place a hundred times. No more though, I have had enough.

Once I found a live caterpillar in my fresh roll. Another time a whole bunch of hair in my noodles. You get sick sometimes if you eat here regularly. 

The cutleries are dirty, and so are the tea cups. We complained about this, and manager told us that \"this is good for your immune system\".

My friend knows somebody who works there, and apparently they reuse
the leftovers for the next customer. 

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"The New York Times mentions it in a Toronto food article...it must be great, no? 

Pho Hung is a perennial favorite of my coworkers for working lunches.  It has (or had) quite a buzz about it, but I think in reality we really go there because we know it will easily accommodate a group bigger than 4 and that the food will be served in a reasonable time.

The FOOD: Well, lets talk about the eponymous pho...it's a solid pho, but certainly not the best in Toronto.  It lacks some of the depth and complexity of the best pho I've had in Vietnam and around the world...I think this stems from less care in roasting the spices as well as maybe spending less on the bones you boil in the broth.  You will be doctoring the pho pretty heavily with condiments, as it's not so exciting. 

Many of the other dishes are hit and miss.  Their menu is enormous, which I think results in a lack of quality control.

One highlight for me is the Avocado Milkshake...an unexpected yum which I now make at home sometimes.

The SERVICE:  What service?
Barebones here.  You fill out the card, wave it frantically at a server, he takes the card with a grumble, and your food will come out in whatever order they feel like bringing it.

My worst experience...the waiter spilled broth on my shirt and pants.  I tried to get his attention for help with dealing with it...he just scurried off...no apology, no extra napkins, no anything.  

The ATMOSPHERE: Plastic tablecloths...check 
Unfriendly staff scurrying around...check.  
Big glass windows with some interesting people watching in Chinatown...check.

OVERALL, this is a perfectly average pho place.  No reason to mention this in the NYT.  No reason to steer any friends here.  No reason to go here unless you need a place to have lunch with 8 coworkers nearby in a relatively quick fashion."}
{"text":"So I've had the dac biet pho and the dac biet hu tieu here.  Both were passable but nothing amazing.  Both times, the broth was pretty tasty but I left very thirsty.  I know that some people consider MSG 'cheating' - irrelevant to me, but there you have it.

While the L and XL servings are quite big and you get a big piping bowl of broth and noodles, the meat doesn't seem to get proportionately bigger as well for the heftier price tag.

Overall, not bad but nothing amazing.  Judging from the crowd, this restaurant is popular sheerly due to its visible location/nostalgia.  Don't let the hype fool you."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here, saying it was the best pho in the city, but I can't agree. I went back on my own this weekend and tried a bowl of Hue style soup and, again, the food came up a bit short for me. 

The ambience was great and the place was packed both times (even at 9pm on a Sunday), but something about the soup was lacking. Pho is very subjective, so I can't really say there was any glaring issue, but it wasn't to my taste."}
{"text":"This place is located in Chinatown. My first time here. The place was like any other place place in china town. It never looks clean, especially looking at the sauce bottles. When was the last time it was clean, I'm not sure. Service was nothing special. I don't even think the waitress said a word. We ordered the food by writing down the number on a piece of paper. Ten minutes later we had our food. 
The food was alright, well it was actually good. I just didn't like how the place wasn't clean. So it made my food less appealing. 
The only time I would visit this eatery again is if I was craving pho and no other place was open."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, good value and cheap. The only Vietnamese option in the Junction it seems if I'm craving some Pho or Vietnamese dishes. The service is fast and the tea is free. Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho place in downtown Toronto. I was told that it used to be better and was the best pho in Toronto. They only had small, large and extra large. Only 1 dollar difference btw small and large. They only accept cash only. There is a sign say there is no msg added however I don't believe that. Restaurant was quite busy. Fast customer service and pho came out right away. I ordered small size and it as perfect size for me."}
{"text":"Came here for Banh Xeo and they were out... but then I ordered the pho... it was okay. They had a leakage... droplets kept dropping on my head which caused me to lose my appetite because who knows what has landed in my food. Staff were friendly but management needs to pick up their game. Management seem like they were slacking."}
{"text":"Best pho in town after trying golden turtle, tien thanh and all other pho place on Spadina. But only the pho are good, rice and apprentice were just ok."}
{"text":"Great portion size and prices.

Had the lean beef pho and vermicelli.  The broth was good but a tad on salty side.  Vermicelli was good with lots of meat."}
{"text":"We were driving through Mississauga and I had a hankering for some Vietnamese food, and since I'd been to Pho Hung several years before and enjoyed the food, it was a total no-brainer.

The restaurant was almost completely full, but we were nevertheless able to snag a table by the window. Our server immediately presented us with complimentary tea and a couple of menus. I knew exactly what I wanted, so I filled out the accompanying paper to indicate my order of Bun / Vermicelli (\"Grilled Beef, Spring Roll with Vermicelli and Vegetables\").

(I should note that I also indicated, on that paper, that I wanted glasses of water for myself and my dining companion. We never got them.)

The food arrived a short time later and it's probably the best version of this dish I've had in quite some time. Everything worked; the meat was delicious and flavorful, while the plentiful noodles and vegetables were a perfect accompaniment. The included spring roll was hot and fresh, as well.

(At first I was a little concerned that a dish of fish sauce wasn't provided, but then the waiter brought over a jug of the stuff. A whole jug! I've never seen that before, but I wish more restaurants would do that.)

The only negative aspect to the meal was the subpar service. In addition to not receiving the aforementioned water, our waiter didn't appear at all once we got our food.)"}
{"text":"Coming from a Vietnamese background, I typically prefer home cooked pho. However, Pho Hung is the closest to home cooked pho! This place is delicious and I absolutely love their avocado shakes here too."}
{"text":"Having seen many great reviews about this place, i set out to find a taste of home. I was lucky as it's not crowded when i was there. After a glance through their menu, i decided to go ahead with pho dac biet (house special item): combo of tendon, beef balls, rare beef, etc. First look was the broth. It was a little more oily than i prefer, and not as clear. Always love myself some clear, amber, fragrant pho broth. As lacking as it looks, the broth tasted milder than my liking. Second was the noodle, banh pho. It was smooth but a little too thin, almost like hu tieu. Lastly, though I personally have nothing against it, there is msg in the broth.
Overall, it was not bad. Do i think it lives up to the positive reviews and my expectations? No. Will i come back? Probably not any time soon."}
{"text":"Five star pho.  Dirty and cheap doesn't matter when the pho is this good.  Impress your friends with outstanding food is my motto.  Everyone loved everything."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the City!

Amazing portion sizes, great simple foods and very very cheap.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"I have to admit I love this place.  the service is kind of terrible but when I sit down to my small C12 (tofu and vegetable noodle soup) with a side of crushed peanuts, it's a little piece of heaven.
Dining partners that have ordered meat soups have given mixed reviews... sometimes chewy or stringy, but I've never had a bad bowl and will continue to hit up this Chinatown favourite."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant in the heart of Chinatown Toronto. Unfortunately, I experienced better. This restaurant offers so little portions compare to other pho restaurants. Although I do like their Mango milkshake (Sinh To Xoai). Pho and vermicelli are average."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR CHANGE THEY TRIED TO JIP US $5 and THEIR MEAT WAS DISGUSTING. They are CASH ONLY.

The male Vietnamese boss is very rude. He stands at the door and checks everyone's orders to make sure you meet the minimum. He doesnt smile unless you're definitely a tourist (judges by race). There is a minimum of $6 per person charge and not allowed to share anything. He came over and specifically told us that. You also can't take anything home with soup if you don't finish. I Do NOT recommend. 

GRATUITY IS INCLUDED FOR 5+ otherwise I would've given 0!!!!!

TLDR: BAD SERVICE, DISGUSTING, DIRTY FOOD. Only popular cause it's on a popular street full of tourist who would never come back."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and soup is salty for those who like stronger tastes. Owner is nice. Would go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food for an excellent price. You can get an entire bowl of noodles and meat for only $10 approx. The service is decent but I wouldn't say spectacular oh, it's the food that really makes this place nice as well as the ambience. We have continuously come here for a cheap dinner which is also delicious. I would recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"I'd almost give them five stars but please see warning at end of review.

We did not actually try the pho at this Chinatown eatery but the bun (noodle) dishes were excellent.  I especially liked my combo - I had the pork (actually a sort of ham) and beef wrapped in mint leaves.   Huge portion, good prices and delicious.  An order of pork fresh rolls was also excellent.  No real decor but porch section is good for people watching.  Note the \"cash only\" sign on the door.  Friendly service.

Now for the warning:  I was okay after eating but the other two people I was with had a strange allergic reaction causing sore throats and swelling.  They had not had this before with Vietnamese food.  I assume it was due to some herb or spice but not sure.  An anti-histamine cleared it up so it was definitely an allergy.  Neither of them have problems with MSG, so I don't think it had anything to do with that.  Just a warning to be a bit careful if you have a history of food allergies - no negative reflection on the place itself."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho, there is sadly not much alternatives in this area. The Pho itself is very limited in terms of variety, as usually you would find 10-12 offerings with different variations of beef.

Biggest buzz kill? They charge you an extra $1.00 for bean sprouts. Really? That stuff cost like $0.20 if that.

The problem with charging extra is that they give you insufficient bean sprouts to begin with. Table 1? One plate of bean sprouts. Table of 2? Same plate of bean sprouts. Table of 3? Same plate of bean sprouts.

So how can you charge people more money for bean sprouts when they give you the same amount regardless if you are 1, 2, 3 people."}
{"text":"Just ordered a take out there! Paid and waited for 10 ish minutes. Food then arrived. While I was walking out to get my ride.  The guy who took my money, yelling behind my back \" hey hey\" a number of times, then I turned back. He yelled and asked if I paid, I said yes. He was shaking his head saying no I didn't. I then reminded him I paid him 3 x $5 and he gave me $2 back!!! .  He goes \" oh yea yea \" ! 
I was totally embarrassed by his forgetfulness, and the fact that the restaurant wasn't even busy at all at the time I ordered. 
it's totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"The location is in the intersection of Spadina and Dundas, super easy to spot! The food came out super fast (took around 10 minutes)? I got #1, regular pho in Large size - which was actually really filling. I wish I got the smaller size as that would have satisfied me (and I wouldn't have had leftovers). The taste was okay - but I wouldn't say it was anything spectacular. Just another nearby pho restaurant. The service wasn't too friendly either - they gave us food and left us alone. Also note that this place is cash only - which we did not know in advance. Not sure if I would come back again as this was a very average place with average service."}
{"text":"I've passed this bustling pho joint on a prominent corner of Spadina many times and thankfully, finally stepped inside.
Always packed (which to me is a good sign of good food) we were seated right away.
I know pho is the main soup to slurp, but the Vietnamese Sour Soup caught my eye and I'm glad it did: A sour broth made from tamarind is loaded with freshly sliced pineapple, okra, celery and other veggies along with puffy fried tofu (I ordered the veggie version) and served alongside your choice of vermicelli or rice.
What a soup! Every slurp was followed by a remark of \"Ohhh\" or \"Ahhh\"
Can't wait to warm up here this winter and slurp some more soups!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for pho after my doctors appointment next door.  Just wanted to say the pho was very yummy ... definitely comparable to Pho 88 and other good pho places around the city!

As with most establishments in downtown area, parking is not free unfortunately (green P parking on street, also at the back of the building with entrance nearby)."}
{"text":"Read...  shocking review!

I am a pretty big Pho eater and have had pho (or tried to) in all the cities that I travel to.  I read the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try as I saw some mixed reviews.

Got to the restaurant around 7:00pm and it was pretty busy.  A good sign for most places.  Because I was a lone diner, the waitress gave me a small table right by the entrance.   Didn't really like this spot as everyone who came in basically stood by my table as they were waiting to be seated.

I ordered the #1 large pho (house special) and 2 spring rolls for dinner with 2 cold spring rolls for take out.  The prices were $8 for the pho and $4 for each set of rolls.

Ok, let's talk about the taste.  I didn't think the soup was flavorful.   I've been to places in Vancouver and Ottawa that have better tasting soup.  Not sure if this was a bad batch, but it just wasn't good.  In the pho, I also had some really tough and chewy pieces of something.  Not sure what it was but it was hard to swallow.  The noodles were decent as well as the meats, tripe and tendon.  BTW, the large size is like a small in moat places.

The fried spring rolls cane out auick.  Not sure if that is a good sign.  It wasn't!   It was a bit soggy in the middle which makes me think that it was sitting out awhile.  It wasn't hot like it normally should be after coming out from the fryer.

The cold spring rolls (take out) were ok.  Pretty small rolls and basically shrimp and vegetables.   Other places do a shrimp and pork roll.  The peanut sauce was good.

So, all 3 dishes were either below average or just ok.  Does it warrant a 1 star because of that?  NO... but the next thing does.

For some reason, a man (looking for handouts) was going table by table handing out cards.  Presumably asking for some money and giving some reason explaining his situation.  Don't get me wrong because no one should be out begging for money and food.  BUT, to see the staff look at him and disregard how he is bothering patrons at each table is ridiculous!  They even step aside when he is doing his thing!  It doesn't help that the man had a bad odor emitting from him.  I was shocked by this.  

Would I come back again?  NO WAY! !!   The restaurant didn't care about my dining experience.  Why should i give them my business?  I spent $21 for the food and a decent tip.  I didn't get my money's worth."}
{"text":"Not a fan in any way. I guess I will start off with the good. They have a decent menu, but their dishes are subpar. And they are in a prime location.

Service is bad. Food is mediocre. I am not against beggars, but usually you would ask them to leave if they come in and disturb customers. I was extremely vexed and disappointed over this.

Server was also incredibly rude and arrogant. He was not in the slightest bit happy and he could not comprehend that I do not like fish sauce. I did try to explain, but he would only listen to himself.

I would not come here again."}
{"text":"I think the sketchiness of the restaurant adds to the experience, especially when it comes to Pho. 

Went here for my second Pho experience, and I have to say I really loved it. I'm not sure if they do or don't put MSG in the meals, but it didn't really matter to me. Slurped it up in no time. 

Ordered the house Pho with spring rolls. Waiters seemed to forget that we had ordered pop and the spring rolls, so the dish didn't come to us until after the Pho. No biggie, still recommend the place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, overshadowed by the horrible service.  Without answering the question about placement of the order (needs a form to be filled) she told the person besides me to tell me how to order as he's been here before (he never had). Didn't even apologize and just told us in a huff how to order. 

Had the curry chicken. Great portion sizes. Well seasoned. Good tea (unlimited with a hot or cold option), nice food. Wish the service was better!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pho restaurant in the downtown core. I mean, you can't really screw up pho and it's hard to review a typical meal eaten while intoxicated. But I ate it sober and it was delicious.

Pho Hung tops my list because:
1. It's priced well per portion. 
2. It's fast.
3. It's clean
4. Service is good.

I ordered the pho #6 large and it was too much...but it only cost me $7.50! This was large enough to share with someone else. I also ordered the spicy chicken wings. They came out last and were covered in a mild-ish looking buffalo sauce. It was quite yummy and reminded me of a butter style wing sauce. Hooters? Turtle Jacks? They were good."}
{"text":"Visited this place with a friend after having read the abundance of positive reviews about pho hung. 

We ordered the cold shrimp rolls which were average. The special pho and the rare beef pho. 

The pho was a nice size and the broth was so delicious unlike some other broths I've had you could taste that a lot of different ingredients went into it. The beef was also very fresh and tender. 

However, the reason why pho hung gets 4 stars despite delicious food is the relatively horrifying service. Staff are super unfriendly although efficient and it makes me unwilling to ask for more napkins or a refill of tea. Even the manager and the lady at the cashier look at you and speak to you with An animosity unlike any I've experienced in Canada so far. It is actually on par with some of the worst service I've had in Hong Kong where I'm from.

Tl;dr great food would come back for it but the service is not good"}
{"text":"This place is usually busy. I've only been here once. Their pho broth is ok. Service is alright. Usually prices are good with pho places."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years. It used to have a second location on bloor street before it was tore down for new condo development. 

Authentic pho. Cash only. I always get #3 - rare beef and beef brisket. Small size is enough for me now, but back in my more ambitious eating years, I used to be able to consume a XL bowl, followed by not eating for a couple days. A bit like when snake swallows a small deer, it will just lay there for the next couple months.."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.
Definitely  the best I have had in Toronto yet. 
If this is your first test, get the #1 pho which contains all the toppings (rare beef, well done beef, brisket, beef balls, tendon, and tripe) and they give a generous amount! The portion is very nice so unless you are starving, the small will do. 
The broth, needless to say, is what makes a good bowl of pho.

But I would avoid getting rare beef since in my bowl the broth wasn't hot enough and the beef slices were clumped together, the beef was still very very raw when I finished the noodles."}
{"text":"Uhm. No. 

The food is reasonable, but nothing more than that. I had much better.

But the service - oh dear, the service! I mean I can get that this is a cheap place, I don't expect white gloves. But a smile and maybe handing me the plate instead of throwing it to me? How much does that cost?!

It was cheap, let's give them that. But could only be paid in cash which I dislike."}
{"text":"Still good, but after moving to Vancouver where the Vietnamese food is really really really good, I found the pho not as amazing as I had remembered.  The broth is on the greasy side and the brisket is on the fatty side.  Their rare beef is really excellent though.  Lunch for 2 (small pho, large rice bowl, and spring rolls) was $20, including tax tip.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went on Saturday for lunch. The place was packed and we had to wait in the hall way by the door. We were very excited to try this pho place, but the way the staff and owner treated us was rude and disrespectful. 

We were three, and due to some dietary restriction only ordered one big bowl to share and a lot of appetizers. The owner claimed that because we were three customers we HAD to order minimum 3 bowls of soups or we could leave! We tried to be accommodating and bought 2 small bowls and kept the appetizer but it still wasn't enough. My little cousin doesn't eat much and I don't see why a restaurant could dictate what I should order or even the amount! 

If you claim to have a minimum to order, you are responsible to write it on your menu to advise your customers right off the bat and not tell them to leave if you don't want to order minimum of 3 bowls. 

We end up walking out as the owner has suggested and went to eat ramen down the street! What an eventful Saturday."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that recently there is a wait to get a table. In addition, their portion size has been shrinking constantly for the past few years.

I am a regular, and always get the special pho (beef balls, rare beef, flank, basically, the works). Their broth is amazing, not too salty and not too sweet (some broth in other places tastes like as if they added sugar in in).

Occasionally I get bun (vermicelli) and I have never been disappointed.

Their three colour drink is great (mung beans, coco milk, red beans and stringy green jelly), but you can definitely try a sour sop, mango or avocado shake."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am no expert on Pho and would never have tried this place if my friend hadn't introduced it to me and ordered (thankfully) for me. It can be pretty confusing since you order by the number of the item on the menu and the specific size. I always get the number 1 Large and I have still not been able to finish it all even on days when I go there starving. The Pho is fresh, the meat is tender and seasoned well, the service is fast and it's budget friendly too. A Large Pho cost me $10 the last time I was there. 
The only thing I have to complain about is the size of the restaurant, it is as cramped as the TTC during rush hours. Sometimes you have to wait to get a seat but the service is so fast you never have to wait long. 
Not exactly the most elegant place if you're looking for a nice dinner venue but good for a quick, cheap, filling and tasty meal!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

The only reason I come here all the way from the north is to eat their BBQ pork chop rice. The rice portion and ratio to the pork is amazing. Mixed with the fish sauce it's a perfect combination.

The reason I only for 3.5 stars is because their noodle portion is really small. I ordered a large but it's equal to a small size compared to other pho places.

Love the rice but not the noodle so much. Still come Amc regularly though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends, was packed but got seats quickly service was quick and easy. 
1 star due to the pho quality! I honestly don't have a clue why this place is popular. Walked in and saw the store full of tourist. The pho was tasteless, lacks meat and they charge nearly $10 for it. 

Tourist!- go to Dufferin and collage street for AUTHENTIC pho. But if your just around China town go to pho pasteur (24 hour one instead) 5 min walk away. 

I grew up coming here but like all things when tourist start coming around quality goes down...
So sad I usually never waste pho but this one I barely even finished."}

{"text":"Good ol' Pho Hung... You can't really go wrong with this place, but the food isn't spectacular or anything. Generous portions, reasonable prices, bottomless tea, and all the hustle and bustle you'd expect at a good spot on Spadina. This is the first place I ever remember eating pho at, and they've never done me wrong! The broth is yummy and comforting as pho broth should be. Tons of other options if pho isn't your thing... but why wouldn't it be?!

Cash only."}
{"text":"The crowd really builds up here, which makes sense! Pho Hung is a quick, reasonably-priced and tasty joint (if you forget about the vast amounts of MSG floating around in your pho, of course). The restaurant itself is very big and you can sit anywhere you like. You write down your own orders and hand it to the servers, who bring back well-portioned bowls onto your table.

You get a canister of tea immediately, which is great because the food itself can be rather dry or salty. The small size contains a lot of ingredients already, but if you have a voracious appetite you may want to go up a size. The pho is really flavourful (re: salty) but matches well with the otherwise bland rice noodles. You can also order vermicelli without broth, and it comes loaded with ingredients such as fried spring rolls! 

Two bowls added up to ~$20, and service was efficient and courteous. I would definitely come back again if I was in the neighbourhood, but this is not an everyday meal as it's pretty unhealthy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious bowl of pho, this is the place to go! I've visited the main branch on Spadina and their secondary branch as well. 

The only two things I have ever ordered from here is their rice plate with the grilled porkchops and/or chicken, and the pho. I wouldn't say the rice is anything spectacular because if it was I would always order it. However, their pho is always delicious every time I visit. Their broth is clear and tasty that it doesn't even need lime added to it...however I always add lime to everything anyways. Also, the meat is never dry or chewy, which is great! The price may be a bit more compared to the restaurants down the street but I think it's worth the price.

This location is less busy compared to their Spadina location but that doesn't mean their food is less tasty...it's good in Mississauga too!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with no wait to get a seat. Only received half service(we had to write what we wanted to order) Did not have to wait too long for the food.

The food itself tasted only okay, nothing special. I got the typical Pho, the soup base did not contain too much MSG but it was weird, the temperature of the soup did not even cooked my beef. The spring rolls did not come with lettuce (not sure if it's Toronto and NY is different. The good thing about Pho Hung is it's located in Chinatown and it's quick!"}
{"text":"I love this place with duck soup. I tried it and it is really good! Vote for this place. But the service is bad. I and my friend were talking and they want us to go out even it was not so crowded at that time. They gave us the bill and tried to make us leave soon."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch around 12:50pm and it wasn't busy at all. Decided to take a table suitable for 4 guests as I was with 3 including myself and the lady rudely asks how many people when it is already obvious. Anyways, our table jokingly said 4 and she said there is no time for jokes then tosses the menus on our table. We quickly filled out our sheets for the food and made it clear by waving hand gestures and making eye contact to her and other servers and as mentioned before the place was not busy. Anyways, we ended up leaving after 20 minutes of no service."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places to eat Pho in Toronto.

The large here is $7.25.  That's a fair price.  And the broth is good.  The restaurant is fairly open; there is no feeling of being cramped like some other places.

People talk wonders about Pho Hung as if it's the only place to get Pho.  And, it's good, but it's far from perfect.

Rare Beef and Flank.  It was tasty - but there was far too little meat.  There was, at best, four slices of meat.  Often times (at other restaurants) I save my meat, fearing it will be gone by the end, only to find myself left with a bowl of beef at the end.

Following that same practice, I found myself without meat half way through the bowl.

I would probably return - but only to satisfy those who feel this place is a cut above the rest.

It's a tasty treat, but there are other places within walking distance that I prefer."}
{"text":"For some reason, their pho tasted really off to me - I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it tasted really strange. The meat definitely was sparse and there wasn't as much of the cuts of round - it seemed to comprise pretty heavily of tripe and tendon.

The soft shell crab we got was pretty gross. It was all oil and batter and very very little crab. When we bit into it, hot oil gushed out of the deep fried crab and onto our laps. Not ok."}
{"text":"Out of all the pho places in chinatown, this is the one that I visit the most often. They have a large seating capacity, and being the corner lot means they get lots of natural light, which makes the place feel very welcoming. 

This is a very casual place. Once you've decided on your order, just write down the corresponding item number and size on the provided sheet and hand it to a server. The utensils and condiments are all on the table so just serve yourself. 

They have an extensive menu, but I usually just go with the house special pho(#01) or one of the bun (cold rice noodle that comes with different toppings and salad). I also always order the deep fried Vietnamese spring roll. It's very different from the Chinese spring roll; the wrapper is much thinner and there's more filling. You eat it with the special dipping sauce(Nuoc Cham), which is a balance of sweet, sour, spicy and savory from the fish sauce. For pho, small is a very satisfying size for most people, large is good for people with bigger appetites, and unless you're sharing or you're training for competitive eating, I would not recommend getting the XL. There have been occasions where I think I'm hungry enough to finish an XL, but those always end with me walking away regretting my life decisions. 

They get pretty busy so the servers are not very attentive. Note, this is a cash only place so make sure to hit the bank before hand or be forced to use the ATM there."}
{"text":"Great soup, horrible service.  I was in the middle of my meal and my spoon was down when I was asked to leave because there was a lineup waiting at the door.  NOT COOL.  So I proceeded to eat the rest of my meal as slowly as possible.  Wait staff could use some lessons in manners."}
{"text":"We ordered one pho with rare beef and brisket and one vermicelli bowl with every type of pork you could imagine, as well as a fried spring roll. Food didn't come out at the same time, which was kind of annoying. Otherwise it was a totally enjoyable meal. We both ordered the small sizes for a late lunch and it was definitely just the right size, and I'm used to american portions. Partner in crime seems to think it was even too much, we might differ on this point. I like Vietnamese food and thought this was a totally solid offering. Not great enough to hold a wandering eye, but good enough that I might come back after flirting with the others first."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pho Hung special pho XL portion and it was a lot of food (plenty of meats) - and was very good.  Most people ordered pho there so I thought that I made a good choice based on that.   I think a regular or even large size portion will be more than enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Had a crazy random craving for pho this evening and considering I live in the downtown core and definitely not down for Ginger, I decided to venture to Pho Hung since it's one of the better pho places in Chinatown - or so I thought. 

I've always liked Pho Hung over the other places I've tried. It's been generally good. I arrived solo today and already knew I wanted the Pho Dac Biet. The food came quick as it always does because pho is quite simple. It came with the bean sprouts as well. So here is where it goes downhill. I reached for a lime wedge and to my horror the lime looked semi used :( and underneath it the lime looks like it had touched someone else's hoisin sauce and washed and placed on the plate. Is it wishful thinking to think I got a fresh plate of bean sprouts? I was in a hurry so I didn't complain, just ate my pho and didn't touch the mint or plate of sprouts. 

My small pho (which is very very very small at pho hung) which I also ate in under 10 minutes, came up to $8.50 with tax. I just left them a $10 and went on my way. 

Will I come back? Maybe if I'm dying for pho and want it over the other 5 places around Chinatown. But I'm going to have to find a better pho place for my cravings. Maybe on the east side next time. Or home to my mom who makes kick ass pho (like every other Asian mom)."}

{"text":"3.5*  I'm always mixed about writing reviews for pho places as I find them pretty much the same.  Aside from MSG, how can you screw up pho/vermicelli/rice dishes??

Prices are a bit higher than nearby pho places with a small bowl at $6.  I ordered a Grilled Beef w/ Shrimp Cake Vermicelli and it was $8.50.  Beef was rolled, wrapped up in mint leaves which was interesting.  Never really had it presented like that in other Vietnamese restaurants.

Friend ordered Curry Chicken and chicken was grilled as opposed to being in gravy sauce.  She liked it though!  

Another friend ordered Fried Fish with Tomato Sauce and fish was available whole or filet, rice had to be ordered separately.  She also ordered Veg Spring Rolls, and all fried items were greasy.  Could've been strained before it arrived to the table.  In addition to being oily, Veg Spring Rolls were meh consisting of vermicelli noodles and possibly taro.  Meat (Pork) probably would've been better, but she doesn't eat pork.

FYI:  Spring Rolls that come with other dishes are pork unless you specify otherwise.

Service was fine, polite.  Be prepared to flag servers down for attention."}
{"text":"I was here on April 21 and ordered a special pho. The pho was good, but not that exceptional. The portion is really generous compared to the price I paid. I also ordered some spring rolls and the rolls were excellent. Nevertheless, the service wasn't too friendly. I'm not quite sure if it's because they were quite busy during lunch time. The place is cash-only which is quite inconvenient for those who hate cash like me. The lady at the counter was very upset when we asked to split the bill and frankly, she kinda scared me. All in all, the food was decent but the service was bad."}
{"text":"I'm actually a little stuck between a 3-star and a 4-star :/

The prices, like others have said, has steadily crept up over the years. The bean sprouts aren't as fresh as before, and the service...well, the service has always been bad, so not much of a change there, lol.

Their broth was pretty great, and I love all the condiments I can put into my pho there. the portions are pretty decent, and it's usually my go-to restaurant for Pho when I'm in Chinatown (which is why it's getting a 4-star). However, i might be inclined to try other restaurants, especially because nowadays, the broth doesn't seem to taste as great as before? ._. I especially dislike the fact that you can't pack the rest of your pho to go if you can't finish it. The waiters are pretty slow getting your change back. In fact, I think once they forgot to get us our change completely and my dad had to go up to them to ask them for it :/."}
{"text":"One of the better Pho broth makers in Toronto. My girlfriend is Laos and swears by this place. Fresh rolls weren't cut in half but can easily be ripped. Wish they had fried squid like so many other Pho spots but otherwise they had fast service and it was a very satisfying experience."}
{"text":"The spring rolls were greasy and heavy. The crepe was so greasy it was inedible. The pho was good and plentiful. Of the many Vietnamese restaurants I have eaten at all over the US and Europe, this was by far the worst!do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this restaurant. I went there because of the reviews. The utensils were very dirty. We had to go through half of the spoons and chopsticks on the table before we could find utensils without food on them. They left the chill peppers on the table. As a healthcare provider, I found this to be quite gross. I don't know what the people did prior to my sitting at the table. 

The food was okay...I expected better. I love pho especially the broth. The broth was meh...I noticed on the way out that most people only ate the noodles and meat. You can tell how good a pho restaurant is because people will finish the broth as well as the noodles and meat.

The service was below par. They did not give enough basil for two people. I asked for a bit more, and they wanted to charge me $1 for extra basil. 

There are a lot of pho places around. I won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I have a bit of a confession to make... I've been to Pho Hung a lot. Alone. Yes you heard me! Alone! Or with friends. Or my partner. Whatever. I wish I could tell all you Yelp reviewees about half the menu but I only order 2 things. The spring rolls and the rare beef and beef balls pho (small is enough for me). The broth is nice, the noodles are tasty, the side of Thai basil and bean sprouts isn't too small (some restos skimp). Overall it's a very tasty meal. I've had better pho elsewhere but not in Chinatown. It's cash only so hit up an ATM before you visit!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Pho places. I like soup. I like beef. I like noodles. But sometimes, gez whiz, I wish there was just something more going on in this bowl.

Also, have you noticed them with the tea? I think they keep pouring pots together. I don't know, maybe my eyes were playing tricks. 

Good in a pinch for lunch. At the one on Bloor Street, they have perhaps the saddest waitress on the planet. She is never happy. We always leave her an extra dollars."}
{"text":"Thought the pho dac biet (got it in small size) did not have good slices of beef ( tough/dry)...and only two slices. Mostly a lot of the other beef entrails found in the bowl. Noodle soup was nice and hot, and well seasoned and flavoured. For the price it was alright. Also got the deep fried bananas, which were super hot. I love the decor and the wooden furniture. Really neat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try Pho when we came to visit Toronto and we stumbled into this place. Since we were not too hungry, we were thinking of getting one bowl and sharing it between us. However upon order, the waitress informs us that we are not allowed to share unless we order another item (every person would need to order an item) or we would need to pay an extra $6 for the other person. That was ridiculous to me since I have heard of such policies before (if it is a common thing, then please excuse that comment). So we ordered a small spring roll. 

Overall the food was alright, nothing special or mind blowing. I was not a fan of the spring roll since they seemed a bit soggy to me and the pho was just alright. As we were about to pay, we got our bill and we noticed that it was the wrong bill since they only had a bowl of XL pho written down when we ordered a L pho and spring rolls. So we asked the waiter who proceeds to question US on why the spring rolls were not written down. We explained that this was not our bill BUT HE JUST KEPT ASKING US WHY WE DID NOT PUT SPRING ROLLS DOWN. Finally, another waitress came to give us the proper check. 

After this experience, we most definitely will NOT be coming back here."}
{"text":"I was invited to lunch here by a friend.  The place was okay; I'd go back but I won't go out of my way to go here.  The fresh spring rolls were my favorite item tried.  My rare beef and meatball pho was only okay...specifically the meatballs were terrible, the noodles meh, and the broth and other ingredients pretty good.  As others have noted, the place is crowded and the service is surly when it exists, which is exactly as I found it."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful. What is interesting about this place is you pretty much get no service - but the service you do get is really fast.

Food wise, it's really cheap - and you get pricing like this around the city at a few pho places, but i have to say, this is amongst the best pho broth i've had in Toronto. It doesn't compare to authentic, home cooked with lots of love for two days, but it's pretty darn good for the price you pay - and other places in Toronto at the same price point don't have the same taste to their broth at all."}
{"text":"A large restaurant with crowded seating. Extremely quick service. The pho itself is good but not the greatest; it is slightly bland. Meat is pretty good quality. A small is about $7.50 with xl being $10. I think the xl can be larger :)

Go for: quick and quality food and service 

Don't go for: the best pho"}
{"text":"Cheap, easy, fast service, great on a cold winter day; you're going for the quantity and price point here, the broth is good but not fantastic.  

The shrimp rolls and pork rolls are plain and definitely need the dipping sauce. 

Quantity will balance the quality for the starving foodie."}
{"text":"Finally they got it!

Servers started to greet you with smile, they respond to you when you ask for something, their chopsticks are cleaner.

Food is great as usual."}
{"text":"This place is ok for a quick cheap eat.  Limited veg options and a bit greasy for me. Very large portion sizes here! I only ever order the small and I can't imagine how huge the large would be!!

I'm sad to say that all the veg soups have beef  or fish stock in them. :("}
{"text":"This is the baddest experience for me. After dinner and left the restaurant about 20mins. I throw up and I can tell the vomit are vegetable just ate from the noodle. After that, I feel getting headache and hot. My bf also feel so headache.

My bf call them to told what happened on us but she wasn't nice to said maybe my stomach problem and their food is so good. 
I want to say....I had lots of different food in my life. I grow up in Hong Kong and travel to China, India etc. I never throw up because of food.

If I can give zero star. I must give them minus five!!!!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Bare bones. Busy. QUICK! I was in and out in 15 minutes. Baller. 

I ATE 
Won ton soup. Cheap. Good. Not amazing but hits the spot on a cold winter's night and good for the price. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Cheap and cheerful. Those bowls are big. Eat in and take some home for the next day."}
{"text":"Going with 3.5 stars. Yelp should allow for .5 increments.

Came here with friends, who were raving about the place. Definitely didn't disappoint, either in the food or the service department.

We went during prime dinner time on a Sunday, but were quickly seated; it's a pretty large restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the noticeable lack of grime and actually liked the hustle bustle of the place.

I had the curry chicken pho,since I have never had this type of pho. It tasted great but was very heavy. It had a creamy base, almost something you'd find in a thai or a Malaysian curry. It tasted great with adequate amounts of lime, basil and sprout. Very good, but tres filling. My friends had the kebabs wrapped in mint leaves and grilled beef. I tasted some of their food and the grilled beef was particularly great: just the right amount of tender. The kebabs were good, especially with the touch of mint but it felt a bit dry and the mint flavor wasn't too obvious: perhaps they overcooked their kebabs? 

We were all satisfied with our orders and our time at the restaurant. It's darn good value for money.

Going to Pho Hung made me nostalgic about the time I spent in a Chinatown in a different city as a university student. I am going back to Pho Hung pho sho!"}
{"text":"Ahah. This place! Yes! Pretty decent.

There were really three things that stood out for this place...maybe 4.

First: You get LOTS of meat, very red meat, tasty meat, yum yum Pho Tai meat on the side. No need to boycott due to lack of giving me meat on the side.

The Rolls...YICK. Totally sub par on the rolls. Don't do it, eat your rolls anywhere else.

The Pho itself was very good. The broth was super tasty!

The thing that stands out the most for me here was the fresh red peppers that they had at the table. I've never seen this at a pho restaurant and if you look at my review lists you'll see one with shy over 50 different pho joints. They were AWESOME!  I think I used all the peppers on my table...must have been 8 full peppers, and I attacked two in a single spoonful o' soup. Maybe that was a mistake, my stomach wanted to become three mile island, but DAMN was it tasty =)"}
{"text":"Good summer rolls and Pho broth, but the beef balls were chewy and the meat was generally unappetizing in the Pho.   

Not impressive."}
{"text":"If I was rating the Pho itself, I would give this restaurant a five...their broth is very clean and delicious.  However, if the waitress was my daughter, she would be grounded and sent to her room for two weeks.

Regardless, its hard to beat this Chinatown/Kensington area Vietnamese Pho hotspot.  Portion sizes typical and yummy though there is a big print on the menu that says you can NOT take home leftover Pho!!!  Luckily, I ate my fill and had no refrigeration options."}
{"text":"We came here straight from the airport after a flight from LA.  Pho on a cold night after a long flight... man, it's the perfect food.  The menu has more choices than I'm used to seeing at Pho joints.  A bit overwhelming, but no worry, we got this one.  My wife had a combo pho with beef brisket and rare beef.  The pho was good quality with plenty of meat and a nice broth.  Not enough bean sprouts and lime on the side, but you can always ask for more.  

I got the hot n' spicy Vietnamese noodle.  I like my spicy foods spicy.  I know most Vietnamese places don't play around with terms like \"hot n' spicy\" but sadly, it wasn't.  Medium/hot at most.  I added some sriracha to kick it up, but of course then it begins to taste like sriracha rather than the broth.  Generous with the meat, although it was too fatty for my liking.

Best we have had?  Not nearly.  Nonetheless, we enjoyed thoroughly."}
{"text":"Classic Chinatown pho place for a quick meal. Pho is tasty and comes in very fair portions for the price. Don't expect fantastic service or top notch cleanliness but that's Chinatown for ya.

The deep fried shrimp dish I ordered was just OK - there were a lot of large chunks of fried onions and not much shrimp. 

We also got an avocado shake and a durian shake. Both great! I can tell they use real fruit.

We went around 9pm and they were closing half the restaurant for the rest of the night. The bleach they were using was really overwhelming and made the rest of my dinner really unenjoyable.

... that being said, nothing beats a $10 bowl of noodles and food broth so I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pho place in Mississauga.
I used to go to Pho Mi 99, which I thought was great...until I had Pho Hung. It's spacious, clean, the people are friendly, and everything tastes WONDERFUL. There's no weird pieces of who knows what in your soup or bun, extremely tasty. I don't have one negative thing to say. The reviewer below is right...its a little bit extra, but completely worth every penny."}
{"text":"Used to be my fave!! I would go atleast once a month every winter. They put MSG & lately I've become ultra sensitive to MSG. I am on the hunt for a good non MSG pho place."}
{"text":"Efficient, tasty and authentic vietnamese.

The menu and ordering system is needlessly complicated in a few places."}
{"text":"This was the first time at Pho Hung and Chinatown in Toronto. My wife and I went in and asked to look at the menu. We were met with disinterest by the waitstaff, gave us the menu and walked away. I was wavering on what I wanted to eat but my wife was set on noodle soup. We tracked down the waitress as she pointed to a table, dropped off 2 menus, an order form and walked away. So far no words were spoken to us by anyone at the restaurant. We perused through the menu, made our choices and waited....and waited. Finally, we got the attention of young man who pointed to the order form. Now we were getting somewhere. We wrote down our orders which were promptly picked up and taken to the kitchen. Soon we received our dishes and were not disappointed. Excellent food. I saw why the restaurant was busy - for the food - not the service. My wife had the noodle soup with beef, beef tendon and tripe - tender meat with just the right balance of noodles and broth. I had the vermicelli with beef and spicy beef plus a beef spring roll. Both excellent choices. By the way, the menu is expansive so there are a lot of choices here. If the management work with their employees to be more friendly, this would be a top notch place to go in Chinatown. There was no welcome or help with the menu as well as getting someone to other tables. That is why I only gave them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Not much to add to previous reviews.  Good Vietnamese food.  Loved the pork bun."}
{"text":"Popped in here on route to Kensington for a late lunch and was reminded why this place is still my favorite spot for Bun.  The chicken has such an amazing flavour, tangy and savory and the spring roll is worth every calorie associated with deep fried goodness.  I have been here more times than I can recall and I have never once had a bad meal or a terrible MSG reaction.

This Pho Hung location is OG, legit, and delish!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a nice steaming bowl of Ph, but I must say... although their broth is savoury and delicious, the portions are really small for the price you have to pay. 

I ordered the large bowl of noodles and was quite disappointed with the restaurant's perception of \"large.\" In addition, there were only a few slivers of meat in my bowl and just an average amount of noodles. Needless to say, they did provide a heaping plate of vegetables... 

Overall, the service was ok, the flavour is present, however the value for the food here is missing."}
{"text":"BANG! 
Ok.. i once was in the city a lot and really loved pho hung a lot. 
Then i moved to the burbs, now i don't go to the city anymore...However i there are a lot of great places to eat in peel region and the fact that a pho hung opened up on Dundas is great... I always get rare beef with beef balls, i really love the fact that the rare beef doesn't appear pre packaged as it does at other pho places. This stretch on Dundas has several great pho places, and i think this is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"P r i c e s  are UNDER $10 including tax and tips

P o r t i o n s  are reasonable (idk about you guys, but whenever I eat anything soupy, it only fills me for a while before i get hungry again so be warned)

F o o d  is comforting, light and delicious! Pho soup base is savoury and drinkable, not too oily. The noodles and beef are great too! The grilled chicken was nicely marinated and plentiful (Had the pho + grilled chicken vermicelli, but i'd prefer the pho)

A t m o s p h e r e   is typical china town place and service is quick

0V3R411 -  7H15 P14C3 15 GR347 4NY71M3!  Did you guys get that?"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese, best I've had since moving to Toronto! The veggie pho is delicious and topped with many greens and fried tofu. Vietnamese coffee and fruit shakes are on point. 

Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you find yourself having to make a choice between a totally random foreign film and a movie starring Will Ferrell & co. The WIll Ferrell movie will probably hit the spot (for you, I'm not a fan myself), and you pretty much know exactly what you will get. 
For anyone who has been here, Pho Hung is Will Ferrell. He will probably get some giggles out of you, but he is pretty predictable in a good way. Service is very fast and straightforward, and the food is almost always fresh and delicious. You may not be wowed as much as that hole in the wall Vietnamese joint you found in Parkdale, but you'll be happy with what you got. 
 
During my most recent visit I tried the XL Pho Tai and an order of special spring rolls. The spring rolls were nice and crunchy as expected, and are provided with any rice bowl you would order anyways. The pho broth is pretty balanced at Hung and lacks any real complexity, but has enough flavour to keep you happy. The side of basil and other herbs is rather underwhelming compared to most pho places, but at least what you get is obviously fresh. 

Overall a positive Chinatown dining experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place remains my favorite for pho!

Still... they should give saw leaf and be open later than 10pm! Staff is not particularly  friendly but nobody really cares here as long as they are fast and efficient!"}
{"text":"Typical pho place. I agree that it is better than most but not extraordinary. Markham has better pho."}
{"text":"I frequently come to Pho Hung whenever I am craving Pho in the city! Their pho is great, but you have to know their service isn't the best (hence why I left out a star in my review). If you don't ask for water, you will never be served it so make sure to speak up as soon as you get there. You also need to speak up when you want to place your order because you'll often be ignored until you flag the waiters down. 

I always order the Rare Beef Pho + the Cold Shrimp Spring rolls which comes in a delicious peanut sauce to dip in. The spring rolls come in generous portions so when you order 2 pieces, it can actually be shared with 4 people as you can see in my photo. This time I ordered the vegetable fried spring rolls to try something different and they were very good as well. I would probably go back to the cold spring rolls because they taste so fresh and aren't as heavy. The pho is always consistently good! I wish my beef was more rare when it was served to me this time but the soup must have been so hot it cooked the meat fast. The soup comes in generous portions - the large is huge but I always get it because it's only a dollar more than the small. 

I wish they let you take your leftover soup home if you had some leftover. Seems like a waste to not let you take it home!"}
{"text":"Ordered an XL #03 (rare meat and brisket). Pretty disappoint because:

1) The meat wasn't even rare, it was cooked

2) The serving size was pretty pathetic - for an XL, I didn't get very much meat

3) Not worth the price

Honestly, if you can only go downtown, this place is passable, but I would recommend Vietnam Noodle Star at Midland & Finch in Scarborough. I paid $7 for a bowl just as big as the XL I got here and it was twice as better!"}
{"text":"Being a Southern California native and Vietnamese, I was very excited to visit this place.  Being the number 2 pho place according to Blog TO, I wanted a hearty bowl of noodle soup especially since it was raining.  I was quite disappointed in this place.

The broth was pretty tasty although it definitely has MSG.  I always figured I can adjust the taste a bit with the Hoisin Sauce, Sriracha, and lemon.
The noodles were overcooked.  
The meats were a little tough.  Even the rare beef felt tough and chewy.  How is that even possible?

I probably won't go to this place again, at least not for pho.  And, I definitley not recommend this place to my parents.  On with the search for pho..."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading this place to 3 stars for a couple of reasons.
I came back again and tried their pho, it was good.
I tried their deep fried spring rolls, it was good.

Price is reasonable, especially compared to Pho Pasteur down the street.
Still pretty dirty, but I guess that's chinatown for you.

Just remember that if you are ordering rice, the portions will be small."}
{"text":"After still feeling unwell I decided to have pho again for lunch. I ordered number 5 small with lightly fatty beef ,tendon and tripe. The broth was pretty good not as light and flavourful as golden turtle but still good. I got quite a lot of tripe and tendon which I like and the beef was very tender. For around $8 tip included it's not bad and will return."}
{"text":"Pho was OK, noodles were over cooked and the broth was lacking (salt helped) service was not great and we had to ask for napkins - she gave us 2 for a table of four."}
{"text":"Food: 4S
Service: 4S
Ambiance: Viet Stars

I was here actually about a year ago before I started using Yelp heavily.  I was here backpacking with a Brazillian and a French. 

We all had a heavy night of drinking and dancing at \"The Guvernment\" until 6am.  We had a good time and tired. Came back to the hostel and crashed hard.  We woke up at 6pm and I told the guys the best thing we could have is a good bowl of Pho.  Since they never had it and were game, I researched and chose Pho Hung.

We walked the 1.5 miles to wake ourselves up and got here.  The place wans't too packed at 7pm.  We sat down, I helped them order. 

We all just had the Pho Tai.  They loved it.  The Pho was really good! I am glad we went to a authentic place that served good pho. This was the only place in Toronto we tried so I can't compare what the rest of Toronoto pho is like.  

I can say I've had Pho may places around the world: London, Vietname (Sa Pa, Hanoi, Da Nang, Hue, Saigon, Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, Venice, OC) so I have a reference to what's good and bad. This place is good.

Try for yourself, that's the only way.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the vermicelli with veggies and tofu/chicken/what-have-you here. It's got lots of cilantro, tons of crunchy sprouts, and the little spring rolls are crispy greasy heaven. 
All the soups are good, in my experience. I got just shrimp, noodles, and veggies - turned out to be okra and eggplant (what a ride!), and even with no real meat the broth was rich and a bit spicy.

Service is hit-and-miss - last time we went we had a lovely middle aged gentleman who was attentive and asked the right questions (how much condensed milk do you take in your Vietnamese coffee?)

Have you guys ever had the Vietnamese coffee here? 
Holy moly it's like melted coffee icecream folded into espresso. 

The milkshakes are also *delicious*, partly because of all the cane sugar, but...come on. You just had soup as a meal. You're not a monk.

FUN BONUS: Amazing people watching and eavesdropping locale. 
Have tuned in to a surprising amount of high power business conversations in here. 
*Come for the Pho, Stay for the Canadian Mining Secrets*"}
{"text":"Toronto really has some delicious food options, especially in Chinatown. My best friend and I were starving after a long day of shopping and wanted to grab something to eat. It was a snowy/rainy kind-of-day in Toronto, so we really wanted a warm meal. Pho was for sure an option, and we told ourselves that the next Vietnamese restaurant we walk by; we're just going to go right in! 5 seconds later we walked up to Pho Hung. Perfect timing I'd say. 

I loved the atmosphere of this place, it had that busy city feel - tables and tables full of people slurping their pho ! Of course we ordered pho too, duh. I really loved that you could order a smaller portion of pho or the regular sized portion. Most vietnamese restaurants that I've been in don't really have that option ! It's either one size or no size. The food was as authentic as it gets! We had a pretty good experience.

I would've rated this place 5 stars, but the reason I'm not is because of the confusing waitstaff. One person seated you, one person took your order, one person brought you hot tea, one person brought your food and another person delivered it. Then you never saw anybody again. Seems like no big deal when reading it in this review, but in person, it was so darn confusing and frustrating! What if we wanted to order more food? Whose attention do we try and grab? How do we pay? Who should we tip? They all put in equal amounts of work. I don't know. There were at least a dozen different people running around at any given time. Payment was confusing too because you had to fill out your own receipt with the item number and name, then total it yourself. We didn't even know who to give the slip to till someone finally walked over and took care of it for us. Bah! 

Either way ! Now that I somewhat understand the process, I will still visit this place in the future. The pho was WAY to good to just walk by this place next time around, just because I didn't like the ordering/receiving process."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 3 and a 4 star. The pho here is perhaps the best in Toronto, but there's definitely room for improvement. I've noticed that the prices have increased in the last few months but the quality of the food has stayed the same or even dipped slightly. Overall, it's still a great place to chow down in Chinatown. There's a large menu of Vietnamese dishes for you and your group of friends to pick from. I've never had the smoothies, but always hear the blender going so it must be popular! I always get the #1 large, their pho soup and it's my staple meal whenever I come here. Pro tip: I once saw Olivia Chow and her friends leave here."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the area , we discovered the this spot. We use to come at least 2-3x a month for some pho and curry shrimp.
The food was always fresh, tasty and portions were great ! However, for 6 months of going there they could no get the order right, customer service is non existent! It's a place to come eat and leave, better not have any questions if you don't understand something.
However last experience was so brutal that I left in the middle of ordering the food.

I miss the food never had any issues with the quality of food it was delicious but the service is atrocious."}
{"text":"I have been going here with my parents for years and just love it! 
Probably the best Pho in the city.
Here is the lowdown:

Pho Hung is cheap and HUGE portions and no non-sense service. 
You must try their soup. Their \"small\" rivals most places Large, so I suggest you think twice before ordering and XL!

I highly enjoy their spring rolls and chocolate/banana desert.

FYI Cash only."}
{"text":"First of all I need to say :\"if you ever go there make sure give least tips possible!\" My gf worked there before, they pay them $5/hr under the table cash and $70 a WEEK for tips--SET AMOUNT of TIP. While the owner ranks thousands of dollars of tip a week. She urged me not to give any tip at all cuz all go straight to owner. 

The pho is okay, I would rank them 7 out of 10, bit of plain doesn't come with lots green basil or chilli pepper. Also on menu it says \"NO left over soup take out allowed\" lol.

The menu is HUGE, but quality control not so fine. I ordered the fried fish, it came as a thawed piece of fish breaded, like asian style fish n chips(without chips)Slimy ....ugh. 

Me n my friend both ordered the NO.30 dish, lemongrass curry dish, except he had chicken n mine is beef. My beef dish was so chunky and chewy, just very bad texture I had to ditch it too. However I did go back to order the same dish in chicken which is excellent. 

This place is a hid or miss depends what u order. The place has very bad decor all sorts of random pics of some men holding fish or wooden fish on the wall.  They give u bill and urge you to leave when it's busy. I know they are being \"ordered\" by the boss in order to keep their jobs."}
{"text":"Pho Hung is the place to go to get your fix of pho or vermicelli bowl. Be sure to go early to beat the office lunch crowd. Since it was cold today, I decided to order a hot pho instead of usually curry chicken vermicelli (see below). I usually order the large because I find that the small portion always leave me wanting for more. However, since I've never ordered a small pho before from Pho Hung, I decided to see what their portion size was like. I ordered the #1 special that had everthing - thin slices of beef, tendon, tripe and half a beef ball. The amount of noodle to toppings was perfect! The soup was delicious and you can tell that they've been doing this for a long time. I was so full after finishing my 'small' bowl that I can only imagine what their large bowl size must be like. Mmmm.. the pho really hit the spot on a cold day!

My coworkers and I always get the 19A small (curry chicken with spring rolls vermicelli). It comes to $9.00 including tax and I've never once finished the small, I wonder how much food they give you for the large! I've tried the pho too and the beef broth is delicious and savoury. If you're by Kensington market or have a craving for Vietnamese food, go to Pho Hung!"}
{"text":"I ordered #29 curried shrimp with onions on rice which was plain but tasty the curry has a good flavor and not overwhelming. The shrimps were peeled and ready to eat and didn't taste frozen.

I also ordered a well-done beef pho, large size which I shared with my party. Huge portion which was good but not as good as other Pho soups I've had. They were missing more lime juice to balance out the flavor with some acidity. The rice noodles were soft and my lunch companion made a comment that the beef was great while I did not see anything special about the thin slices of meat.

Clean, friendly safe and fast service this inexpensive restaurant is great to eat lunch when comparing other \"heavier\" fares found in the area.

I would return. Total with tip &tax $23.50"}
{"text":"My visits to Toronto usually involve trying out new and unique restaurants. Since Pho Hung is located all over the GTA I had never intended to eat there. But this particular one was close to where I got a parking spot and I also liked their spacious, fully windowed concept, plus it was pretty busy, so It looked appealing at that moment. 
We got seated immediately and I was anxious to get my favourite item at Vietnamese restaurants: the lemongrass chicken vermicelli.
Unfortunately, they do not offer any chicken vermicelli's and I was not feeling pork or beef that night. So I opted for the shrimp vermicelli.
My mum ordered the vegetarian vermicelli and we also ordered the vegetarian rice paper rolls as an appetizer.
The service seriously was lacking and I had to literally wave for some attention and also personally request for water, which wasn't surprising since the place was busy. 
The rice paper rolls arrived and were normal...nothing special. Then my mums vermicelli arrived, which looked like they just mixed vermicelli with vegetables and dumped soy sauce all over it. The presentation was awful and looked like a 3 year old made it.
I waited for mine for almost 20 minutes, during which my mum was almost done eating hers. I asked the server and he looked confused, which I understood to mean that they forgot about my order. Another server then arrived 10 minutes later to ask what I had ordered! another 20 minutes and several gestures to the server later, my meal finally arrived. It looked soggy and the serving size was tiny. The noodles were over cooked and in small pieces rather than long strands. Then the worst part of it was that I saw, not one, but TWO eye lashes in my food, which were definitely not mine, since I noticed them the moment the meal was served. 
So...overall, this is one of the worst Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA (perhaps even Ontario). There are a million better ones right next door. Do yourself a favour and stay away."}
{"text":"Clean and modern restaurant, unlike the other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Mississauga. 
I liked that they had a full page dedicated for vegetarians. The food was served extremely quickly and I finished my meal in less than half an hour. So this place is ideal for a fast meal even though the ambiance makes it seem like a nice sit down restaurant. 
I enjoyed my seafood pho and the portion sizes were huge!!
The prices are very affordable too.
Not very memorable but a good place worth going once in a while."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here today.
Ordered the #1 which is the house Pho, and the curry chicken with rice and spring rolls.
The pho soup stock is delicious! Probably one of the better ones I have had in the GTA.
My wife and kids enjoyed the curry chicken rice.
We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I've become kind of obsessed with pho in the past year or two, and Pho Hung is probably in my top five places to go. It's kind of out of the way for me, otherwise I would go there more, but it's a great joint in Chinatown. 

Pho broth here is definitely hearty and cozy, if I can even describe it as such. Some pho places make a broth that tastes like they used one of those broth cubes and called it a day. Pho Hung's broth tastes as though it's been simmering all day and absorbing all the flavours and spices. Soooo delicious.

And I've had some of their non-pho choices as well, and was super impressed. I think I had a curry tofu deal once and it was SO good that I kept eating even after I was full and then felt as though I would explode.

My only irk with this place is the service -- I've found it to be kind of slow and wait staff could be a little friendlier. Then again, I've heard that all the tips go to the owners, not to the servers, so that could explain why they don't try harder. 

Also they aren't a late night pho place which is kind of annoying. They close really early which forces more people to go to Xe Lua down the street, which is open 24 hours.

Regardless, come here for the food, and don't be surprised if there's a crowd -- it's a huge U of T hotspot."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho and bahn xeo was quite terrible - far cry from what is made in Vietnam, but mainly writing this to note that there were roaches (both dead and alive) on the floor of the restaurant. We couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"I am rating the food that I tried which is grilled beef and spring rolls with vermicelli and vegetables. The beef was marinated in an amazing sauce and the spring rolls were to die for. It was my first time in this place and definitely not my last. I just wish they have better customer service because seriously, it sucks. Good thing they're serving great food otherwise we wouldn't come back. The tea that they served was cold so I guess that adds up to their poor customer service. I mean who drinks a cold tea? Really???"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is not very good or friendly, prices are inflated due to having mostly western customers."}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty and the prices are affordable as well. I like that you can choose what size you want, either small, large, or even x large. Even though the restaurant is packed when we got there, we got a table right away and the food came out relatively quick after we ordered. It was interesting to me that we actually had to write down our order on the piece of paper they gave us but it wasn't a problem. Overall, good food here. The customer service is average."}
{"text":"Wow, this place downgraded. Whenever I went to Toronto, this was my to-go place. Ordered some bun bo hue and it was kind of bland. Not watery tasting but compared to other Viet places, a lot blander. More spice would do the trick. 

Honestly, everyone in the group was disappointed. The food was definitely subpar. The only thing that was good was the service. It was a busy hour so props for them. But overall, the experience was a letdown."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus their pho is good. Insanely good. So good, I don't think I can eat it anywhere else anymore. 

I've never tried any other mains on the menu and I'm OK with that. Perfection in a bowl.

Not a big fan of the cold rolls, though. The peanut sauce was off which kind of ruined the experience. Texture, people, texture!

Don't miss this place. Wait in line, do what you have to do, but get here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Toronto doesn't have many pho places and Pho Hung is probably the best you'll get for the price. The broth was good, the noodles were acceptable, and while the meats were okay, the portions were smaller than I'm used to (but then, Vancouver has a lot more good pho places). 

The joint itself is standard Chinatown - dirty, unfriendly waitstaff, and not a place you'd want to linger. Oh, and they only take cash.

Should also mention that I got the runs after eating at this place."}
{"text":"Eventhough I was running errands around the Yorkville area, I went to the Pho Hung in Chinatown rather than on Bloor Street after reading the slightly better reviews.
Service was not bad, but not good either. I came specifically for Pho, and they had a large menu of Pho which is what I was expecting. The food came quickly and the portion wasn't as large as other Vietnamese restaurants which was fine by me as I am not a big eater. Their Pho comes in 3 portion sizes: small, large and extra large -- I don't know why they just have small, medium and large.  The large was pretty much the equivilant to a small at other restaurants.

The Pho was very good, with plenty pieces of meat. The plate of Thai basil and sprouts on the side was measley and I was surprised that I didn't get any fresh jalapeno or chili peppers. The Siracha sauce at the table seemed watered down and I didn't see any other kind of chili sauce to go with my Pho.  The soup was very tasty after the addition of Siracha. I could've had the entire bowl of soup, but I knew they use MSG which I did experience a slight headache after my meal and felt really thirsty.

I wasn't really impressed and still looking for a good Pho place downtown. It seems like the Asian restaurants in Chinatown is going downhill, as much better quality modern Asian restaurants are plentiful up in Markham and at the same price or cheaper."}
{"text":"Long lines for average pho. I don't get it. Prices are average for pho (cheap)."}
{"text":"Great food here. Slightly pricier than other similar restaurants but the quality is there. I had vermicelli w/ shredded pork, spring roll and grilled pork. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot of pho places and I don't know a lot about Vietnamese food, but what I do know is that I love Pho Hung! By far some of the cheapest, delicious food you will ever eat, with generous portions and quick service. I really wish I could remember the number of the thing I always order. It's the Vermicelli noodles with grilled beef and spring rolls. The small is really a large, so I can't even imagine how big the large would be. It's about 6 dollars and they bring this tasty sauce to the table that you put over the noodles. I always mean to try something else but it really is SO good that I can never sway from it. 

I've been with people who have ordered soups, or other items and have never heard any complaints so I think it would be hard to go wrong here! Their mango milkshakes are also a nice addition. They always bring tea to the table and sometimes in the summer it's iced tea (I feel like I'm constantly talking about iced tea in my reviews, but what can you do). This location is always pretty busy but I've never had to wait for a table and the service is pretty efficient :)"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my fav pho restaurants but over the years the prices has gone up and service has gotten worse and the food has remained the same. 

Will look for better pho restaurants!"}
{"text":"House special pho is prefect taste but make us really thirsty due to many msg. The place is really clean not like other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"I unfortunately didn't see the big deal about this place!  The broth was good - heavy on the anise and the meaty flavour.  However, the noodles were all stuck together and didn't seem fresh.  Fixings were meager.  Bowls of soup were about $1-$2 more than average.  

However, the decor was nice, the place was immaculately clean and somewhat serene despite a lot of customers (quite unusual for a pho place!) and the staff were actually pretty friendly.  The food came out super fast too.  

Perhaps a place to take someone who has never had pho before who is looking for good service."}
{"text":"Great pho. Service isn't awesome but you can overlook it if you really want some good food. It's a busy, busy place."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat thai in toronto and actually my first restaurant in TO. So maybe a little bit of nostalgia :) 
No honestly the choice is really large. So many dishes that you can't try all of it. Maybe a bit frustrated. So you look on your neighbours to decide which one do you prefer. Way more easier ! 
And I was well surprised each time ! 
One problem maybe: the space. A bit noisy. So much people."}
{"text":"There's nothing better than a hot bowl of pho to cure a rainy day! Pho Hung is clearly extremely popular, and we waited for about 5 minutes before being seated. Compared to what I'm used to having uptown, I find that the portions were a little smaller than expected. I tried sharing an XL bowl of pho with my bf (which I can usually do uptown) but found that we were still hungry afterwards so we ordered another small bowl. That aside, the pho here is very satisfying and not too oily. I will come back for sure if I'm on the hunt for pho downtown!"}
{"text":"*** 3.5

I'm a regular here... so what does that mean?

It's good place for good pho for good prices.  It's not the cheapest.  I've been to pho places where a large is $6 and it wasn't bad at all.  This place will charge you $7.25 for a large and a $8.75 for an extra large.

I normally get the rare and well done beef and it's cooked well.  The broth is tasty and very consistent.  Personally, there's a place uptown where the broth is a little sweeter and that has started to grow on me.  

I had a few of their sides and they're generally done well.  The vermicelli also solid.  The only thing that's a little shaky is their shakes (see what I did there? =P).  Last time we got one, we couldn't finish it as it has a weird taste to it.  It's mango so how could you have messed that up.. hmm.

Overall, not a bad place.  I prefer this to other places dt as I guess... I like familiarity.  I know what to expect and can count on good pho.  The service? They bring you food.  So as a regular, you come as it's a good place for good pho for good prices."}
{"text":"Tasty.  Quick enough.  Cheap (under $8. for a b*i*g serving).

Service was ok, but I came here for the quick enough bite, and for tasty food.  

I couldn't tell if there was MSG, but I was thirsty afterwards (isn't that a sign?)

As a vegetarian, I was sad to read that even their vegetarian \"Buns\"/Phos had meat (see the pic that I uploaded).

My colleague and I shared a veg pho $6.50 (small);
and a fried veg dish with rice noodles $7.50 (small).  Oily, but I liked the taste.  The kind of dish I can enjoy from time to time, but not weekly."}
{"text":"I had their House Special Beef Pho when I was here for 7.50. It was pretty good though I thought the place I regularly went to in Los Angeles was still considerably better and cheaper as well."}
{"text":"Very good pho!  Service could be better (more staff) but it does have charm."}
{"text":"I got #24 Bun La Lot Chao Tom, which is a bowl consisting of Beef Shish-kebobs wrapped in wild betal leaf/ pepper leaf, minced shrimps on sugar cane with rice vermicelli and vegetables. A small was $9. 
The meal was good, but was not the best I have had. I expected more out of this place but the service and restaurant's interior was nice so those are pluses. The servers handled my big family of ten so I give them many kudos for that."}
{"text":"Pho Hung is one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants.  Granted that it is usually busy and line ups are unavoidable at times, but this is a sure sign that the food at this place is good, right?!  
I ordered Hung's large bowl of special Beef Rice Noodle Soup with both rare and well done beef tendons and  tripe ($9).  And indeed, the bowl fits its size description on the menu!  The soup is delicious, and there are enough meat and veggies that many restaurants tend to chintz out on.  
The service is fast so my stomach is a happy customer when the food is planted in front of me !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner is super friendly and always say hi when we come in. Love the pork vermicelli w spring roll and their wonton soup. The regular beef pho is delicious especially on a cold winter day. Cheap. Good food. Quick. Im a happy customer."}
{"text":"An old standby; I've been coming here for nearly 8 years now. It was the place I first introduced my friends to the wonders of ph?, and where I continue to go anytime I'm looking for a fix. It's no longer the only place around, nor is it the cheapest; but the spartan atmosphere and indifferent service are unpretentious in a way that some of the other 'Asian bistro/fusion' places aren't. Get the milkshakes - they're surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I rarely rate any restaurant, but I will make this an exception. Owner was extremely rude. She showed no interest or respect for her customers. Not only that, after we put in the order, we asked the owner to speed up a little so we can catch the flight in time, she turned away, and just ignored us.

The other vietnamese staff did not smile once or answer when we asked a question. We thought she was a mute--I would have felt bad, but shes just grumpy. 

The Canadian/white staff tried to speak in Vietnamese so we were impressed--keep up the good effort. 

Food wise was okay.

Would not recommend this place based upon customer service."}
{"text":"We were hungry. We were cold. We're tourist trying to eat a warm bowl of pho before continuing with our day. This review will be short. The service was bad. The waitress just handed out the order slip and a pen for US to write down our order. She walked away as we were asking for some info. The coffee came last even though we specifically asked for it first. FYI, most Vietnamese restaurant brings it first. The food?! BAD. We ordered pho, congee, shaken beef. The shaken beef was super bland and the rice that came with it was probably yesterday's rice. I had the pho. I got sick. My sister had the beef and her stomach made weird noises. It didn't even sit well with her boyfriend either. Bad service, bad food. Sorry."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few coworkers, randomly chose a spot to eat so there was no expectations for this place. The inside was a bit on the rundown side, typical Chinatown restaurant. The decoration and atmosphere resembled most pho places. 

Everyone ordered pho, nothing complicated and pretty standard. If it was just based on food, this place would be average and not a bad place to grab some pho in Chinatown. But the service was terrible, if not the worse. One coworker found a piece of plastic in the soup, of course they stopped eating and waved down a waitress immediately to inform them. The waitress didn't seem to care and also tried to play it off as if it's a normal thing that could happen. Tried to explain how the plastic was probably used to wrap the beef, its clean and there's really nothing wrong with it being in the soup. Really felt like an argument which later resulted in asking for the owner instead, coworker could no longer talk to the waitress calmly.

Overall, there's better pho out there so definitely won't be coming back in the future for waitresses with attitude."}
{"text":"Not good as it once was. The broth seems to be made from a powder mix, there is enough meat, and other stuff  (tripe and tendon), but the broth isn't flavorful and the owner really doesn't care, it's a cash cow (only cash), wouldn't be going back anytime soon, it was fast, but not great. It use to be good about 7-8 years ago, but has been going downhill."}
{"text":"Not sure why I gave them only 3 stars in my review last year because I'm super satisfied every time I come here. Here's to 4 stars! I went here this past week and yet again ordered my go-to dish of banh xeo. If you haven't ever had this dish before, it's not found at many places but is definitely a Viet dish. It consists of a sort of thin crepe, folded over and filled with bean sprouts, pork slices and shrimp. When it's done and served well, the crepe is thick enough to hold the pork and shrimp in but crispy on the outside and the dish should come with a whole lot of green herbs - basil, mint, lettuce and a bowl of the fish sauce. At Pho Hung they've got everything covered.

Quick fast service. Lots of tables but still packed. Pretty noisy. Yummy food."}
