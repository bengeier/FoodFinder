{"text":"the owner is half a crook.  here is the deal, you need to keep your eye on him at check out EVERY TIme.  its bogus.  we go in there all the time and the staff is the bomb; they are great guysl, they know our name and order.  i hate to cut the place off as it half unfair to them.  Memo is the owners name. yesterday he simply looked us in the face yesterday and stole a dollar fifty two.  i lousy 1.52, came up with a LAME excuse, as to why, but that did it for me, i'm all done.  food is great but andele up the street is just as good and they don't try to skim a buck and half on every ticket.    sum it up  Good tasting food, Great and friendly staff, Crook Owner.  you decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"Frequent this place quite often. The food is usually great, the salsa was good on this occasion. The service is a bit spotty, depending on the attitude of the server. I usually tip well when the service is good. On a recent visit I believe they actually got occupied in the rear of the establishment. They never returned to the table and we had to flag someone down to get the check. One of the guys who is a regular \"server/leader\" does a great job if he waits on you. I would recommend it for the food, otherwise the wait staff is touch and go."}
{"text":"We picked this place to eat at because we have never ate here before. We were in the area to go shop at Costco and this place was close to there.  My older son did not like this place at all, but I think he was just having a bad day.  It's typical Americanized Mexican food.  I'm not saying that it's bad or great - but I'm also not jumping to go back. It was just very conveniently located."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Friday night and I have no idea why. The atmosphere was hectic and loud.  My shrimp dish had more garlic than shrimp,  rice was dry,  my husband ate a few bites of his Tacos El Pastor and brought the rest home for the dogs.  The \"homemade margaritas\" were nothing but a homemade blend of bottled sour mix and maybe a splash of tequila, not even served cold. The waiter barely said two words to us the entire meal. And the prices were on the higher end of most Mexican restaurants in the area. This dinner was a bust, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant out there!  The waiter who is nearly always there is always very happy to see everyone.  There is never an empty glass or salsa chip bowl on our table when we're there.  Prices are very reasonable, especially if you go for lunch.  They give you plenty of food to eat, and I always leave feeling awesome!  They also have special beers on tap, and are the only place I know of where you can get a domestic draft beer for $2.  Awesome food, and awesome service.  I frequent this place repeatedly, and I have NEVER had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Service was unbeatable! Truthfully, our iced tea drinks and chips and salsa never once became fully empty before the waiter refilled them.  My wife and I had the steak tacos, my eldest son steak nacho dinner, youngest son chicken fingers with fries. All of the food was exceptional.  Very professional, friendly, staff.  It really would be difficult to beat this place for service, quality food, and reasonable prices.  Oh yea, almost forgot....my wife is a chef and knows quality food and service, and she was impressed."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Mexican restaurant. The food is consistently good, and service is always friendly.  The servers recognize regulars after a few visits and take care of them. We always hope to get our favorite server, Mel."}
{"text":"I decided to give this restaurant a try after giving most of the others in the area a go. I ordered a super combo which included a tamale, taco, torta, enchilada and rice / beans. It was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever tried. The ground beef was extra greasy and super fine in texture. I was AMAZED at how crowded this place was for the quality. I'd go to any other Mexican place in Concord over here.  No horchata :'("}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of state for grandson's graduation.  My daughter and family like this establishment.  I ordered a chili relleno and couple other things.  Prompt service but when my dish came, the chili relleno was minus the poblano pepper.   Must say the stuffing was delicious, just wish I had had it in the pepper.  I asked my server why it was missing and he said, \"well, I guess they forgot it.\"  Just wondering if there is a new way of making them.  Otherwise not too bad.  Tasty stuffing and good cheese.  Oh well, I might try it again but will inquire first. I chose not to make a stink about it as rest of my party were satisfied with their dishes."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant - food is wonderful and the staff is very quick and attentive. I split an entree with someone and the kitchen prepared it nicely on two separate plates without additional charge. My only criticism is regarding takeout - twice I've ordered takeout and found items to be missing from  my order."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My company frequents this restaurant at least once a week, the service is always exceptional, the food is hot and delicious! I would suggest staying away from the shrimp and rice. Especially if you are like myself and have an appetite. I ordered this entree a couple of times for lunch during Lent and left hungry. That is the only problem that I have."}
{"text":"A distinction between authentic Mexican food and say Southwestern or Tex-Mex is its intense flavors, colorful decoration, and variety of spices.   Having sampled authentic Mexican food, this fell short in taste, flavor and spice.  For instance, Chips and Salsa is a staple in mexican meals, but also a key indicator to how authentic the food will taste.  I don't believe the salsa  was fresh because it lacked the flavor of charred tomatoes, peppers and onions.  The service was was courteous and friendly.  It was local, we went during lunch which was quiet and prices were reasonable.  We ordered carnitas which was dry and the chicken tacos was okay.  Both plates lacked presentation and wasn't what we were expecting."}
{"text":"We took my wife's brother and his wife to dinner here based on the recommendation of my granddaughter. We made a reservation for 1730, but it was not really necessary at that time of day.  When we left around 1900, however, there was a line waiting to get in.  The chips and salsa as appetizers were delicious, and the server was generally attentive to refills. My brother in law and I enjoyed Dos Equis beer; we each had two. I was impressed with the taste which went well with the meal.  I ordered the Burrito Casa Grande with beef strips, beans, lettuce, and a cheese blend served with guacamole and pico de gallo. The serving was tasty and generous.  Other members of our small group were equally impressed.  I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars because the carnitas are out of this world! Such tender, flavorful pork-- and a lot of it. I have my leftovers under lock and key in the fridge now. The last time I ate at Casa Grande, the server recommended I try the carnitas since I had commented on how good the beef chimichanga was-- once again, tender & flavorful. The rice and beans are fairly typical but, yum, yum, yum- ya gotta try the carnitas!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The customer service isn't good at all, they do not care about keeping customers happy. The food isn't good either. Honestly I've been a customer here for about 10 years and to each it degrade to where it is at now is sad. I'll never come back to this restaurant and neither will any of my friends or family members after our last visit this weekend from dining in. This place isn't worth your time or money!"}
{"text":"The place is big and looks really nice. It's definitely gets busy here. One of the more popular places in the area it seems. However the food just isn't that great. The guac is a premade mix, not fresh. The food portions were large but the quality was just okay at best. Maybe because it was so busy the day we came in, the food was rushed? I don't know."}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant for 12 years and love it! The best Shrimp taco salad ever!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 13 years now and have NEVER had a bad experience. The staff knows my family and I very well and they always say hi and shake our hands. The food is excellent and the XX draft beer is ice cold. Prices are fair and the restaurant is VERY clean!!!"}
{"text":"Our families favorite Mexican restaurant of all time! We go for our birthdays each year and always have a great time. The staff is amazing and always make us feel at home. Make sure to tell Daniel and Miguel that chi chi's loco sent ya! Not my nickname btw! LOL  Order a Texas margarita on the rocks and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Simple Mexican restaurant, good food and a favorite place to go and hang with friends."}
{"text":"If you're craving Mexican food, great place to come enjoy some. Fast, friendly, and helpful wait staff. Great tasting flavorful affordable food. Eat here!!!!!!! Enough said."}
{"text":"Went in and placed a Togo order and they got it entirely wrong.... I ordered a Chalupa with rice and beans on side. The chalupa was supposed to have shredded beef.... they didn't even put the chalupa in my order. I called them to inquire and the guy who took my order argued with me.... saying I didn't order a chalupa but I paid 11.83 so is that how much rice and beans costs now.... I WON'T be back."}
{"text":"I need to go to Sam's in Kannapolis, where should I eat? I love  Mexican food, is there a viable choice? Of course, it's Casa Grande! Fast, efficient, delicious.  Salsas both hot and mild were tasty. The waitstaff was friendly and courteous. ACP was the new pollos con crema. So incredibly cheesy.  Kids choices were exceptional.  Had Dos Equis amber on draft.  Will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner experience at Casa Grande. I always order the spicy salsa and the kids enjoy the cheese dip. They have extra cold mugs to enjoy dos equis in and the service is fast and friendly. The waiters love entertaining the children and the kids love them for it. I used to get the pollo con crema but it's actually called arroz con pollo here. Either way it was SUPER cheesy and I loved the fact that they brought me 3 tortillas instead of the usual two. We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I'd forgotten how cheap Mexican food is. I had a giant lunch for $3.25. I've spent more on a bottle of water!   The Speedy Gonzalez consisted of a taco, an enchilada and choice of rice or beans. This is a typical Mexi joint, so don't expect to be wowed with either gourmet influences or taqueria authenticity. Salsa was mediocre, a little thin, and could have used more heat. But it certainly filled me up!  Service was pretty personable. If you find yourself stuck in Concord, it's not a bad spot to stop in on."}
{"text":"Ordered  beef  chimichangas received chicken. Replaced plate did not have ordered refried  beans."}
{"text":"Both wife and I had the chicken chimichangas. Excellent. I had the beans side and wife had the rice. Normal wait time with good service for drinks and food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Mexican cuisine ! For me its Los Arcos if I am in Kannapolis or Casa Grande if I am in Concord. Great food and great service ! You wont be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"When we lived in NC we always ate here- super friendly staff and great prices and very generous servings. We moved out of state an recently came back for a visit, so to my surprised they- not only recognized me but asked about a friend a use to go with all the time! Food was still amazing still had great prices! Win-Win! It was a taste of home away from home!"}
{"text":"Best local Mexican! Delicious margaritas and they have gluten free chips and low fat meals. One of my all time favorite Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, good food, and good price. Please take down Menudo from the menu, almost never available every sunday."}
{"text":"Casa grande is a low key/casual place that's perfect for a date. I love the food and the service is on point 99.9% of the time. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place.  I found it average, not anything special.  New location is definatly a plus, it is always busy.  I ordered the Fundido cheesy thing, it was cheesy and tasty.  Great Margarita prices.  During a soccer game, except a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Great find in Concord!  I am not a huge Mexican food eater, don't do beans, guac, and rarely rice.  I really appreciated the fact they had a decent a la cart  menu and I could design my meal around my likes.  Chicken taco, steak taco, steak quesadilla blue motorcycle drink and sopapilla for dessert. Had to take the quesadilla home for later. Steak had flavor, portions great, good chips, friendly service. We got there around 5:30 with no problem getting a table.  Around six fifteen there was a wait."}
{"text":"This place serves the worst excuse for guacamole I've ever had.  Ever.  Including fast food restaurants like Taco Bell and Subway.  I ordered steak fajitas.  The meat was good.  The side of rice and beans was like warm at best.  Salsa is nothing to shout about either.  A good ol' jar of Pace Picante is better.    I'm from out of town and was looking for something close to my hotel.  It was busy when I went in so I figured that was a good sign.  Wrong.    The service was slow as well.    I'm giving 2 stars only because my fajita steak and frozen margarita was tasty!    You can do better...."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! Great margaritas! Try the El Combo Special Combo, but be hungry!"}
{"text":"Casa grande is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area so my review is a little biased. I can alway count on having a delicious meal here! The portions are fairly large so sharing is definitely possible. It's always loud and a tad chaotic (in a good way) so don't expect a nice quite dinner. Celebrating birthdays here is also tons of fun because they bring a dessert with one candle and make you wear a sombrero while the staff sings to you. I always get the chicken rice dishes and am never disappointed. My family also always gets the fajitas texanas which comes out on a hot plate. We haven't ever ordered anything that's not good here so be adventurous and try something new!   The reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the cleanliness of this place. On multiple occasions, I've had food stuck on my utensils. It's never too much of a problem for me since I just ask for a new one and they apologize and get me a new one. It happens..."}
{"text":"I would never have even realized that this place was here unless I had the coupon we went with on our first visit!  This is in the Wal-Mart plaza on 29, and they don't have a sign on the main sign on the road, so I would consider this a hidden gem unless you are a plaza regular.   I had a coupon, and we love Mexican so I figured let's try it!  We've now visited twice.  Prices are excellent!  Get the guacamole that has the tomatoes!  Excellent value- HUGE portion for 3.99 or so!  We got the Fajitas for 2....the most expensive variety is only $20 max.  Beers are CHEAP!  Dos XX for $2, yes please!!!  The huge size, 32oz is only $4.  I didn't try and desserts but they look awesome, especially the Fried Ice Cream!  Nom nom.  The service staff is also great.  Our server was literally sprinting around to serve his tables!  Dinner specials M-W (buy one get one 50% off) and lunch specials daily.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed to say the least. This was my first time coming here, and will be my last. If the service had been bad, I would have given this place a 1 Star. It is over priced, $4 for a monkey dish of queso is crazy. The food was extremely bland, the ground beef had no seasoning what-so-ever, the rice was over cooked with frozen vegetables in with it. The salsa was okay, but had no kick to it like one would expect, almost tasted store bought. The sweet tea was good. The taco shell tasted like cardboard, and the burrito sauce tasted like tomato paste with no seasoning. For this place to be so pricey, the food was awful. I will not be back to this place, and I would suggest you take your money elsewhere, there are definitely better places around where you can get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Food is good tasting, but be prepared to get your order messed up. I asked for no cheese and got sour cream on everything. I also found a hair in my beans.. Pretty sure it's a pube.  Oh well, can't beat the price"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  My family and I have been here several times.  Every time I've ordered something different and every time it was delicious.  Always have enough food left over to take home.  My son doesn't like too many ethnic type foods but they do have hamburgers that he loves.  Would give them 5 stars but the first time I went there I noticed a lot of dust.  Didn't notice it after the first visit. They either cleaned it or I haven't noticed it again.  Have been here a few more times and can tell you they definitely cleaned the dust!  Great restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"First time here .. The chips and salsa's are awesome they bring 4 for you to enjoy .. so delish .. I ordered the El Trio excellent a must try .. Very clean service was great for sure my experience 5  sir sure .. I will come back .. Next time I'll post pictures of the food"}
{"text":"Casa Grande is my absolute favorite place to eat when I am in Concord. If I could, I would be there multiple nights at week. It is extremely fairly price and the servers are very attentive. Plus, the food is great! I've never been disappointed. I like to stick to my normal of a chicken burrito, cheese dip, and sweet tea, but I know that anything on the menu would satisfy my taste buds.  If you feel up to it, tell them it is your friend's birthday! Your friend might end up with a sombrero, free dessert, and a pie in his face!"}
{"text":"This is good Mexican food. I came from lunch and service was speedy and the waiter was attentive bringing refills and extra salsa. Speaking of salsa, this is good. It has a nice kick, not too mild, not too hot. I ordered with chicken chimichanga and I nixed the lettuce and guacamole. It came with queso cheese dip on top which makes it yummy. I got the refried beans and they were okay. Overall, a speedy, inexpensive, clean and tasty place for lunch."}
{"text":"When we got here, how busy they were frightened me. We were seated right away got our drinks and ordered the food came out within 10 minutes! It was hot and very delicious. The service is very good here as the food is too."}
{"text":"In concord to meet a friend an we both wanted Mexican an found this place.  I ordered the shrimp taco salad , I love when they know to cook shrimp  My taco was really good now I wish I could say tge same about their chips.  The first ones they brought Were stale:(.  We asked for another order  our waiter looked at us like we were crazy.  They brought us another basket they were warm but no flavor.  Seemed like they came out of a bag n heated thats a shame.  My shrimp taco was good so I didnt need all the chips lol"}
{"text":"I have been here 5-6 times. Most of the times it has been great. Tonight the food was great but the service was not. We asked 3 different times for some more water and after 30 minutes we finally got up and got it ourself.   Aside from the poor service tonight,  all my other experiences have been good. That is why I still gave the 4 star rating. I will give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. But my friend's mom just told me she went the other day and found a cockroach in her food...and that the staff didn't do anything but apologize. Idk how credible this story is but from my experience it is a good place to eat casually, I prefer on the border though"}
{"text":"Their chicken soup is out of bounds! Very hearty and filling. Great remedy for a cold winter day"}
{"text":"Satisfying in every way.  Although the menu is your standard Mexican-restaurant-in-America fare, the service, quickness, freshness, flavor and prices are what place Casa Grande a head above the rest.  I was allowed to custom-order; my food arrived hot in five minutes; my margarita (strong and on special for $1.99) in 30 seconds; and everything tastes great.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Nice family run Mexican restaurant the food and atmosphere is great. Good people when the local high school soccer team played it's last game this restaurant gave them a celebration dinner great people! Others should take lessons"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Chris was great ! Fast and happy! Margaritas special is cool too ;)"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service staff moves extra fast and are extremely attentive to make sure your drinks are full and you don't need any thing.  The place is decorated in beautiful tones with large screen TV's in every direction.  I like the chips that are made in house with the salsa two.  The issue with us, was that we waited over 20 minutes for our food and filled up on the chips and cold drinks.  Our food came out little by little.  That irritated us both, but when it finally came out!  Everything was great!  You get your money's worth!  My chimichangas were stuffed with chicken.  The fattest I have ever had.  My husbands Texas sizzling chicken was pipping hot with giant, tender cuts of chicken, strips of melt in your mouth Beef and butter sautéed plump shrimp.  There were just the right amount of many onions, green peppers and other veggies to compliment the dish perfectly.  Don't take my word for it...  Check the video.  The menu had tres leches cake, but the place no longer makes it.  They also had the breakdowns of the tipping prices at the bottom.    I may have caught them on a bad day in kitchen, which explains the wait and the manner of delivery.  It is for that reason I gave them four stars, instead of five."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant tonight, the staff was amazing... The prices were reasonable.    I had the chicken chimichangas, and while they were meaty and seasoned well they weren't as Crispy as I like them.  My sister had the carnitas, it was seasoned well and my mother had the Azteca.    We all agreed that the beans left a lot to be desired.  The beans were more like bean paste or mashed bean mush, and they charged me $1.29 for a dollop of sour cream!    Other than that, it a nice little local spot for dinner with lunch specials and a separate light menu.  The Queso is mild and delicious.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  Got the fajita quesadilla con pollo Good prices and an expansive menu"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst mexican restaurants that I have ever eaten in. The wait staff was unfriendly and impersonal at best. The food was bland and tasteless and seemed to be straight out of a can. The floors were slippery and greasy. Gordon Ramsey would call it dog food but I think that would be insulting to dog food. First and last time here."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant at 3:30. It took a while to get my order even taken & 30min to get my food.  Considering that the Restaurant was practically empty that is unacceptable. The staff stood around talking & never checked back with me if I needed a refill. The food was ok but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"I have been to Casa Grande a couple times because one of my friends lives in Concord and this is their go-to Mexican restaurant near their house. Whenever I go with them, the staff knows them by name and is extremely friendly and accommodating. It is always awesome to see when staff knows and acknowledges regulars and gets to know their customers.   The food here is your standard Mexican restaurant fare. Everything is a flour or corn tortilla, meat, cheese, veggies, rice and beans... blah blah blah. Everything comes out to the table within 5 minutes of ordering.   The cheese dip/sauce is delicious here. Some of the items on the menu come smothered in it. Do I even have to say.... ORDER ONE OF THESE! But then again, everything tastes better when its smothered in cheese."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant around. The food and atmosphere are great. The bar is neat as well and I have never had bad food here. I have only experienced less than perfect service only once, out of many many visits."}
{"text":"Used a gift certificate/coupon so I decided to try it out. All I have to say is that the food was not impressive and would I go back even having the free meal over again... probably not.   Only good thing- really nice service."}
