{"text":"The Auburn caters to the theatre crowd, which means I'm not cool enough to eat here. Too many salads and whatnot....

It's a good place for a drink though located in the building at the bottom of the Calgary Tower. Watch out for the poor service, though, where they forget what you ordered."}
{"text":"I don't really know much about The Auburn, but at some point in its history this became the unofficial hangout for all people theatrical.  Any given night you can walk in on a passionate poetry reading, an early workshop of a place or a singer making their way through open mic night. 

It's unique in its atmosphere, especially in a very corporate feeling downtown.   If the the Core was a high school, the Auburn would be the where all the theatre-nerds hang out.  That's probably because there are about five or six different theatres within a two-block radius of it. 

Anytime I've gone it has always been a really nice place to hang out. Sometimes I know everyone there and sometimes I don't.  Just like theatre, you never really know what you are going to get and that's just fine by me."}
{"text":"What a lovely place, possibly the only place in the world I have no problem doing things myself. Everyone is very friendly. Not much more to say about the place. You will enjoy it. Try the meatloaf sandwich, I have been eating it for years and I always love it."}

It's was my third time at the Auburn Friday night and wasn't the least bit disappointed with their ability to hold spoken word event. When you don't have to even think about technical issues like microphones and lighting, you know they're up to par.

The food and drink service was still OK. Still not a big fan of their food but their small beer choice is satisfiable, at least enough for me to get lit after a few pints and really start howling at the performers.

Keep up the performing arts community support Auburn Saloon, hopin to grace your stage someday :)"}
{"text":"Just returned from a Bboy/fashion event at the Auborn Saloon just under the Calgary Tower sponsored by some folks at the UofC.  Glad to see tons of talent in Calgary, fashion, break dance, DJ mixing, beat boxing, rapping and art.

The space is an okay size but not for 200 plus people, it was difficult to see folks on stage and I had one of the highest tables.  Service was actually pretty good considering there was only one waitress to serve the drinks to 200 some people.  I ordered the Nachos with Guacamole and for $1.50 I got I would say 3 tablespoons of Guac.  Was this a joke I asked the waitress she said no.  Discussion over.  For $ 8 bucks I had a plate of Nachos about 6 inches in size, but it was topped high and the mix was pretty good; two cheeses, chopped onion and tomato and even banana pepper and jalape√±o, it did its job.  

My gin and tonics hit the spot at $6 and then I switched it up to vodka and cranberry juice, but I am able to write this so it may not be a good sign.  Nonetheless it was a good evening.  

It was well coordinated and the owner and staff were really amenable in making this event happen.

Major up stager for me was this tree that stands inside near the stage, glowing with little lights, in fact she stole the show."}
{"text":"When I think of the Auburn Saloon, I think of special events because it's a great spot for a smaller level shindig. With a riser at the front that can moonlight as a stage and the option to clear out the tables in the middle, it leaves an easily customizable space. I've seen it done up for charity type events all the way to a House party for Halloween. 

The only tricky part about the Auburn was trying to find it the very first time around. Being that it's at the base of the Calgary tower, it's a bit hidden from view.

I have yet to give it a try for just a regular sit down kind of place, but it's on the \"to do\" list."}
