{"text":"I haven't been to this store physically but I didn't order from them on Uber eats and...oh my god. This food is noticeably homemade, fresh as hell, and tastes AMAZING.

They're seriously undercharging for the quality and huge portion sizes. I got a schnitzel sandwich the size of my forearm, an olive container full of coleslaw, a pop, a polish donut, and a custard pie for $13

I can't believe it took me so long to learn about this place!"}
{"text":"Confession here: I'm a Parkdale girl, born and raised. Roncesvalles Avenue was my main drag in my childhood, & later when I'd visit my grandparents who lived there.  It was wall to wall Polish delicatessens there, & with all those scrumptious Polish cold cuts & pastries & chocolate, I was spoiled completely rotten & didn't know it & my stomach, if not my nationality, is Polish.  When I grew up, I erroneously assumed every neighbourhood had at least ONE good delicatessen, but I was so wrong. Leave Toronto, & most towns you visit do NOT have enough good delis.  If you go to Roncesvalles these days, the parking is complicated, & my wonky knees won't let me take streetcars now. That's the only reason I don't go back to Roncesvalles more often.  Having said that, I have recently found a WONDERFUL Polish delicatessen & bakery right in the heart of Mississauga at Hwy 10 (Hurontario St.) & Hwy. 5 (Dundas St. W.) (there are branches in Brampton & Milton too).  This delicatessen stocks 18 varieties (!) of ham alone. Smoked Polish ham, Grandma ham, Grandpa ham, the list goes on and on, and it naturally includes Black Forest Ham & Prosciutto & Westphalian Ham (no deli is up to snuff IMO unless it stocks Westphalian). It has all sorts of exotic sausages (or should I say, wursts?), mouth-watering bakery items, heaven knows how many varieties of Polski Ogorki pickles, many cheeses, cookies, candies, & you can't believe they have stuffed so much into one small store.  Big but patient line-ups at the cold cuts counter. Well worth the drive to Mississauga."}
{"text":"Always fresh & amazing selection of cold cuts & cheeses.  If you're unsure about a particular meat or cheese, they will let you sample before buying. They also bake delicious, crispy bread. Great deli/bakery!"}
