{"text":"Came here on a whim for lunch one weekend because we were looking for a quick food stop off the highway. I didn't have any expectations going in but the food was surprisingly good. 

We ordered: 
- Chicken shawarma plate over rice: You have a choice of fries or rice, and it also comes with a salad which is customizable to your liking. Chicken was pretty good, and was smothered with tzatziki sauce and hot sauce. 
- Falafel wrap: Tasty! The falafel was pretty good, and and the toppings on the wrap is essentially the salad you get with the plate, also customizable. 

Overall, the food was good and the portions were generous. They do have a selection of meat but they were out of everything but chicken that day, which was disappointing (and the reason for ordering the falafel wrap instead of having double chicken)."}

This restaurant was formally named \"Bayti\" - not sure if there is any affiliation between the two, but this place is certainly much better than the original restaurant. 

That being said, this name change piqued my interest and this change was very well noted with their improved Mediterranean cuisine! In comparison to the other shawarma joints in the surrounding area, this place is a winner in my books! 

What makes this place somewhat unique is the vast array of toppings available for your wraps; everything from pickles to olives to banana peppers! The available custom blend of flavours is well appreciated. The value for your dollar is pretty great as well, with the wraps being quite generous for the price paid (around $8 or so).

If you're in the area give this place a shot! I'm sure any shawarma lover will not be disappointed, and I really hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"I used to work nearby when the former tenant was Bayti (RIP). Every now and then I'm still in the area and decided to give Shwrap a try.

In spite of the kitschy name and logo, these guys still do a really good job on takeout Middle-Eastern. The meat is always fresh and really good. Lots of toppings to choose from and they're all very fresh. Go for the lavash bread for your wrap too. Plus, they have an excellent hot sauce which is very unique and legitimately HAWT! I think a chicken wrap is only $5 too. Always nice service.

They do a few other options, such as burgers, hot dogs and something jerk flavoured. Normally that is a red flag to me of a place that can't do one thing right and trying too many things. In spite of my reservations, the wraps haven't suffered in any way. It's up to someone else if they wish to explore the fusion aspects however."}
