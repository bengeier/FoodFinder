{"text":"Delicious Columbian bakery - everything was fresh that I ordered.  Was hoping they had tamales but they will be making that on Friday.  Ordered their gauva pastry, caramel stuffed doughnut, 2 beef empanadas.  That hot sauce was the perfect balance for empanadas.  Literally 20 minutes later, I went back to order their corn and cheese arepas, beef and chicken empanadas to go!  It sure didn't last long in my house."}
{"text":"Go here regularly for breakfast or lunch (also a great snack place) and it's a great spot to grab something when heading out of town. Always fresh, made that day, super delicious baked Latin goods. Great prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of food. Have yet to buy anything that has disappointed me in any way. I love their spicy sauce and buy jars of it to put it on everything. Empanadas sell out quickly so get there early."}
{"text":"Excellent inexpensive, authentic empanadas, cheese bread, and goiabada pastries. It's a small place with just a tiny area to eat in so one'd best order to take out. Absolutely love this place, it's a must-try."}

Reviewed: Cheese Sticks, Roscon and Milhojas de Arequipe

\"Craving\" is the English name of this fairly new Colombian bakery. With just shy of 4 years of having opened its doors in Mississauga, Antojitos gets thumbs up for its fantastic re-creation of Arepa de Choclo, as well as their Palo de Queso (cheese stick), a pastry made with flour and filled with fresh white cheese...like your typical cheesy bread, but with a hint of Colombian.

One baked good that characterizes Colombians is the famous Roscon. This delicious sweet bread, in the shape of a doughnut, is filled with either Arequipe (Caramel) or Guava (like yam) and sprinkled with sugar. How the sugar sticks to bread? Butter baby! 
My recommend would be that you pair this sweet treat with a nice cup of hot chocolate. The filling is not runny, which makes this pairing a delight.

Speaking of Arequipe, another winner from Antojitos is their Milhoja de Arequipe. Milhojas translates to \"thousand leaves cake\". It is basically puff pastry layers filled with pastry cream (aka condensed milk) and topped and layered with Arequipe (caramel). As simple as it sounds, the proper way to make this cake is layer by layer and from scratch. The condensed milk ought to be freshly made the same day and the pastry must not sit more than a day out. From what I hear, this pastry is a hit with fellow Argentinians and Mexicans.

In addition to offering breads and pastries, Antojitos also specialize in traditional Colombian food made fresh and in limited quantities on weekends only. So head on early and with an empty stomach, because once you go in, you will want to take it all home.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"My review is exclusively for the beef empanadas.  Oh my goodness, they were one of the most AWESOME things I've eaten!  They were prepared with cornmeal (as opposed to pastry), seasoned shredded beef and a slight amount of potato - not stingy on the meat!  The hot sauce was the perfect condiment as it was a bit vinegary, which balanced the richness of the meat/cornmeal.  A thought I had for next time was to make my own Chimichurri sauce (I have a great recipe) as an accompaniment.

The establishment itself is slightly easy to miss.  It's in a small plaza, on the north side of Lakeshore Rd E (Mississauga), just east of Cawthra and has limited parking.  They had other pastries there as well and I'm pretty sure I saw tamales in the refrigerator.  The service was friendly as well.  Empanadas were $1.80 each and they accept either debit or cash.

So pleased that I don't live too far from Antojitos as I plan to return in the near future!"}
{"text":"So, this is a complete hole-in-the-wall.  That being said, the owner is super friendly and willing to make items not listed on the menu (I wanted sweet emapanadas which were not on the menu.......she made me fresh tropical ones on the spot!  Tamales are huge and delicious.  Cannot wait to try this place again.  Price points are spot on for the quality and scarcity of this type of food product in the area.  A must try for anyone passing through Port Credit."}
{"text":"3.5*  Very similar to Todo Rico in the Sq1 area!

I'd say that this place offers more snack-y type foods as opposed to sweets.  I didn't see any cakes, but more stuff like empanadas (beef, chicken, & cheese), cheeseball, stuff that looked like donuts, bread, and sweet breads.

Everything is behind a glass counter, so you need to ask for assistance.  Man behind counter, who could've been the owner, was quite friendly...and looked confused as to why I was there.  ;)

Prices were ok, $1.75 for an empanada that came with a spicy sauce and $1-something for a small bun/sweet bread type snack that had a hint of cheese.

In addition to these baked/deep fried good, they also had other refrigerated/frozen prepped stuff like tortillas and tamales.

So if you're in the area, good place to stop off and check out some Colombian bakery items!"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this Columbian bakery after reviewing other yelpers' comments and I also happened to be in the area. I don't really eat Columbian snacks often and so I was so excited to try out this tiny place! 

I was warmly greeted by the young lady at the counter as soon as I walked in. I immediately told her that it was my first time in the store and proceeded to ask her what they recommend me to try. She was very nice and patiently explained to me some of the snacks available. In the end, I ordered a beef empanada ($1.30), a cheese & potato empanada ($1.30), an egg bread/pastry ($2.30) and a guava pastry (~$1.30). Even though they didn't have them in the glass window since it was near closing time, they were able to make/deep fry them for me...probably from frozen pre-made ones. 

The beef empanada was delicious! Not salty or herby spicy, nor stingy with the filling - just the way I like it! Same goes for the cheese&potato one! Eventhough it was freshly deep fried, it wasn't too oily either! I will definitely come back for these. The egg bread was actually an egg-filled dough that's been deep fried. It's delicious, perhaps because it is deep fried, but I don't know if it is worth $2.30. The guava pastry is very nice as well. I don't usually like guava fruits, but this one was filled with guava jam and some custard. It was also delicious and enough sweetness for me!

Besides pastries and snacks, they also have traditional Columbian meals for breakfast and lunch, such as Sancocho and Aprepas. I will definitely come back to this place to try other things!"}
{"text":"I think I might of come at the wrong time, as the chicken empanadas I received were a bit cooler than room temperature. They were still good , I noticed they use a corn based unlike some other places that use a flour base. They also had other snacks. My bf got a corn based pastry w a friend egg inside which he enjoyed but did mention would have been tastier if it had been fresh. We found the crust on the items to be really hard and dry, also very oily. Lastly we also got these cheese rolls which had little to no cheese on the inside.
I've realized all the reviews are great for this place. I will definitely be back to try again, as I said maybe it was just an off day.
It is a nice family business and I love to support small businesses. So I'm looking forward to updating this review."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken empanadas! I've had Las Delicias'--Antojitos' empanadas have way better flavour and chicken filling."}
