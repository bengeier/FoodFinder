{"text":"What a great restaurant. My wife and I are use to going to Morning Star Cafe not far away and wanted something for a change. This place is excellent. We both had their chicken and wild rice soup and it was very yummy. I had the turkey and roast beef sandwich while my wife had their daily special. We both really enjoyed the sandwiches. This place really has your drink choices covered as well. Lots and lots of choices! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is the best deal for lunch. I don't know why I see any of my co-workers walking in with subway when this place is so close. Everything is always fresh, the bread doesn't taste like it's bathed in chemicals like a lot of the corporate sandwich shop bread does. I like the american. It is simple and easy but everything I have had has been awesome.  This was my first time at this location. My only complaint is that they tore the paper they were wrapping my sandwich in today and then started over with new paper. Let's save trees and not waste them on a little paper tear!   Great place!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sandwiches in the east valley! It's a texture thing. They shred their lettuce and meat super fine, and sauces are on point! Everything is fresh. Soup made from a scratch and not full of heavy cream. The cookies are soft and chewy, I mean it is perfect here. Lunch spot must!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a while and never had any problems until today. I ordered a turkey and bacon avocado sandwich and I got a turkey and avocado sandwich. Probably they didn't have any more bacon from breakfast and where to lazy to cook more so they just hoped I wouldn't notice. I called back and they wouldn't come down the street to my work and fix there mistake, they where rude and told me that if I didn't want to eat their anymore that was fine. NO MONEY BACK EITHER,  poor customer service. I won't go their again."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this establishment at all costs. My husband ate a tuna sandwich for lunch today. It is the only thing he ate today and by the evening, he was violently ill. When I called the restaurant to advise them of the situation, I spoke to the manager Sherry. Instead of apologizing for the situation and telling me she would discard of the tuna so no other patrons would become ill, she told me I was wrong, and that the restaurant was not at fault. I asked who the franchise owner was and she told me she couldn't disclosure the situation. I let her know the information was public record, and she simply just made our customer service experience worse. I generally don't write reviews, but I'm absolutely appalled at how the manager handled this situation. Meanwhile, my husband is still extremely ill."}
{"text":"Never again - Absolute horrendous service. I ordered the daily special on a friday afternoon and then waited and waited and waited some more. There were large groups ahead of me that did not receive their meals for 30 minutes or more. And she was not telling anyone ordering after me that there was a delay. There were only three girls making sandwiches and the one taking the order explained to me that the 4th person got pulled over by a cop and was arrested. I had to demand a refund several times before she actually gave it to me. On top of it, she was arguing with me about why she didn't have the sandwich ready yet and that the university location has more people. That is an internal issue that should not be used as an excuse to justify why you are unable to provide a service we pay for. I am even certain that she forgot to label my order as To Go. I have been a customer for years...but at the university location. I did not have any issues, delays or problems. This Warner location brings down the brand name, professionalism and quality. Stay away from this location, they have no idea what they're doing. To ensure qualify service and food, I would highly recommend going to the university location.  Just wanted to respond to the manager - you obviously don't know what is going on in your store. I waited about 20 minutes before asking for a refund. How do I know? Perhaps because I was the customer and also, another customer went up to the counter to ask about her group's order. When she walked by me, she said they have been waiting for at least 30 minutes...!  And she was not the only one - there was a group of four people that hadn't received theirs and asked about their sandwiches. There was no bullying, when a customer has to demand for a refund because the worker refuses - that's a business stealing money from customers! Apparently, you are not experienced in good management skills. You should have stocked your store with more people - quality people that don't get pulled over and arrested. I have no reason to lie about what your employees said...! It is obvious management is in denial of their bad service, and poor training in customer service and professionalism and poor judgement in workers. Rest assured that I will have better experiences elsewhere, however your store is what needs luck."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Delicious sandwiches and friendly people. Cant go wrong. Great prices and specials everyday and super fast. Lightyears ahead of those big chain sandwich shops."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are always fresh. The veggies are crisp and never wilted. They aren't stingy with any of the ingredients, great portions. Bread is fluffy. And the price definitely can't be beat! Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches hands down. They fill them high with meat and the bread is soft. The price is very reasonable and the staff is great. Put it this way I will never go to a Subway, Jerseys Mikes again."}
{"text":"My husband I stopped in here for lunch. We both give it a 3 for the following reasons:  1. Ambivalent cashier - nothing like barely audible one word answers with shoulder shrugs.  2. Can't make substitutions. Well you can, but you have to pay extra for it. And if you want to add pickles to your sandwich it's an extra 50 cents and they do not gout it on your sandwich, but merely give you two spears instead. 3. They said they would bring the sandwiches out to us as we were outside - after several people walking in and out and we still had not had our sandwiches brought out. Yes, I understand that you pick it up at the counter - but they said they would \"bring it out to you in a minute.\" 4. Very watery chicken salad that just tasted of black pepper. Not particularly tasty. And it had waaaay to much lettuce. Like half the sandwich was lettuce. 5. My husband ordered the Sparky - he was expecting actual pieces of bacon - not tiny pieces sprinkled throughout. However the veggies were fresh and he liked his sandwich."}
{"text":"Sandwiches should be a consistent and solid part of every American's diet.  A good sandwich is commonplace.  A great sandwich is rare and something to be treasured.  The Arizona Sandwich Co. Makes a great sandwich.  Ingredients are always fresh. The bread is spongy and soft.  Even the side of potato salad is superlative.   Tonight I had the Acapulco.  Tuna, avocado and jalapeños.  Delicious.   In addition to the fantastic food, the service was fast and came with a smile.  I can't understand why my dopey kids ever would want to eat a Subway."}
{"text":"The size of the sandwich and amount of meat was good but I wasn't impressed with the overall quality. The meat was dry and bland and the bread seemed fresh but didn't taste well compared to others."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 5 years now and if anyone asks where they can get a good sandwich this place is always my first recommendation. They have every kind of sandwich you could want and it's always fresh. It will make you think twice about ever going back to one of the big chain fast food sandwich places."}
{"text":"Love this place. Each sandwich has a lot of everything. You are not left wanting more of anything. I get the small sandwich and only able to finish half of of it. I've seen the large sandwich and even if you are a big eater. You may want to bring your A game."}
{"text":"I'm not a big sandwich type of guy, I always feel like i don't get enough meat. I have had several of their hot sandwiches and I love them. Really good, if I'm in a mood for a sandwich this is the place I'd like to go. It can get pretty busy during lunch time, that is when we went. You need perfect timing to beat the rush."}
{"text":"We love the sandwiches here! Piled high with great meats. Don't skip the house dressing, the tanginess is addictive! Skip the combo, their chip selection isnt great but havent tried their home made sides yet. Their sandwiches are pretty big!"}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall with fresh tasting deli inspired sandwiches. A combo will satisfy anyone and wont burn a hole in your wallet. Try the Shocky!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sparky as turkey, bacon and avocado are a well worn favorite of mine. I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed. Unfortunately I couldn't capture any photos of this beast in the wild as it disappeared in to my mouth at a stunning pace. Don't let their description of this as a 6 inch sub throw you, this is a lot of sandwich. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Overall, sandwich was good and filling, but I was not a fan of the house dressing. It was way too garlicky for me (and I enjoy some garlic on things). I got the Sparky. If I happen to be in the neighborhood, I might stop again, but I don't think I'd go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for a quick lunch because I can leave my office and be back in less than 20 minutes.  They are priced well, good portions, and fast service.  My favorite is the #4- delish!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i had one of the best sandwiches in a long time here, in fact i went out of my way to revisit twice and told at least 3-4 people about it and suggested they check it out.  That all ended today when the girl \"Carol\" that tried to take my order said she couldnt make the sandwich i had already ordered 3 times in the past, an italian (hot).  She said no we cant heat the italian and referred me to the menu showing the three \"approved\" hot sandwiches.  I asked well how do they get heated?  Is it difficult?  No, we just microwave them she says.  I said i have gotten this the last 3 times without an issue at all, she said \"they must have bern new or didnt know what they were doing.  I said well i dont want it cold, why cant you just toss it in the microwave to make a customer happy, it sounds easy.  \"Sir! These are the only hot sandwiches, so pick one of those or step out of line\".  I tried to plead once more saying i really like that sandwich cant you make an exception?  Can i talk to the owner?  No sir!  Is there anything else you want?  I said no Carol, i just wont be coming back again i guess.  Her reply \"WHATEVER\" while rolling her eyes to the next customer in line.  This is a small independent shop that has potential, but imo will never be more than a low scale easy lunch for the nearby corporate offices in the block.    What happened to customer service?  I wasnt asking for anything difficult.  In fact i ordered this before and the clerks didnt even mention i was asking for a special off the menu favor.  Shame on you for treating me this way and shame on Carol for making sure everyone in line saw her make a fool of me.  Good luck in the fickle sandwich biz, oh and did i mention i managed potbelly sandwich works in Chicago for years?  Pathetic."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place before, but it had good reviews, so we decided to try it out. It wasn't too hard to find and we were able to get our food and get seated right away. Food is delicious! I got the hot pastrami sandwich and my wife got a vegetarian sandwich. The tables were dirty and it didn't seem like a high-priority for the staff to clean them. We sat for 15 minutes with no customers in line, and the team decided to eat their own lunches and play on their cell phones instead of cleanup the eating area. I would probably eat here again, but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a sandwich addict. This place has the BEST tuna in town, hands down! Cheaper than Jimmy Johns, a bit more than Subway - but the fresh, locally sourced ingredients make up for it. It gets a little packed at lunch hour, so I recommend calling or faxing your order in first.   Try the #4 or #10! The potato salad is also amazing. I have not had a chance to make it in for breakfast, but I want to. A few times, I ended up going down the street to the second location because they ran out of bread (they are that good). The other location is a lot less busy and you might get hit on by one of the dudes there, but this one has Renee behind the register and she rocks (and also owns)."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I got the Sparky and it was really good! Deffinetly coming back when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"We picked up a to go order from the tempe location and it was WRONG! I called to let them know about the issues, they left me on hold for 7 minutes, hung up on me and then proceed to not answer the phone. I called back 5+ times. Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"This place does have the absolute best sandwiches around. Better than any of the chain sandwich or sub shops and the prices are better too. For the price and the size and quality, you cant go wrong. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in all of Phoenix. Service is great and the food is amazing. The AZ Phili is their best sandwich. The Phoenician is amazing too and their Acapulco tuna is fresh and worth a try. I get jealous when my wife goes without me."}
{"text":"The monday special was really good!! Can't wait to try the other sandwiches!! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich you can get in or near Ahwatukee- and the bread is the best part. My only concern would be the lack of ingredients later on in the day. More than once I have been asked to order a different selection, or given \"options\" that I didn't want because the employees ran out of fresh veggies and were unable to make my traditional vegetarian sandwich.  I've been told everything from \"We can give you extra dressing\" to \"How about some extra lettuce\".  Would suggest a cash box that employees can access for ingredients when owner is unavailable."}
{"text":"I used to love this place both in ahwatukee and Tempe.  I stopped here after an appointment since I don't live in Tukee anymore and I was disappointed.  I got the #3 and a side of macaroni salad. For the 'wich:Before, each bite was a heavenly mix of bread, meat, condiments. Today I really only tasted soft bread. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sandwich, but with so many sandwich places these days I have had better which is disappointing because this used to be my go to. Unfortunately, the macaroni seemed store bought/mass produced. I didn't get that homemade taste or feel to it. I am pretty verses and particular though. Maybe it was just an off day.  I'll go back if I'm hungry and in the area, just won't make a special trip.  They have great prices and many choices so try it and see what you think."}
{"text":"This place has decent food aside from that don't expect much the Tempe location is awful I have given serval chances the customer service is not there! They are rude and snotty. I will not go back here for that reason I can think of a handful of other sandwich shops in the area that are friendly!"}
{"text":"I dont have a favorite cause I'm always trying new sandwiches. Love them all. I go light on the dressing sometimes too. Veggie on wheat is good. Meatballs are the size of my fists and require a fork and knife (take home). Anything with avocado is at the top of my list. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I was actually disappointed. I ordered a Turkey sandwich. The turkey was nice and moist but it had no flavor at all. The bread is waaaaay too big and spongy. Honestly, I could have gotten the same thing at a Subway. At least at subway, I wouldn't have gotten charged for my pepperocinis. They even charge for a cup of water. (The struggle must be real). The only bright side is they have a drive-thru window. The sandwiches are huge but it tasted so awful I couldn't finish it. I want my $8 back, seriously lol I wouldn't go back even for free. :/"}
{"text":"Their sandwich are fresh and delicious. I usually have the chicken sandwich with bacon and avacado. Their mean plan are awesome. They have a good meatball sandwich too. Not very expensive food."}
{"text":"Awesome soft subs with delicious paper thin sliced meats and shredded lettuce."}
{"text":"I had heard about this sandwich shop through friends. The staff was friendly. The sandwiches just okay. My husband had a pastrami sub which was good. I had an Italian sub without the peppers and just house dressing. Not enough dressing. Tasted blah. Side dishes very small portions. Looked like I was eating potato salad out of a plastic shot glass. Up the price and increase package sizing. Potato salad average."}
{"text":"Great food!  University is far and away the best. Macaroni salad is a little sweet for my taste but this small business has great quality and is quick to get the order made.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and awesome sandwiches. Great place will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I just started going here a couple of weeks ago but now end up going at least three times a week. The sandwiches are loaded with meat and taste great, and the price just can't be beat; $5 will get you most of the sandwiches on the menu. Service is quick and personable."}
{"text":"I first had a sandwich from this establishment at work, as someone ordered a party tray for a pot luck.  I was hooked.  I also ordered a party tray for work and have continued to eat there when I needed a quick bite to eat.  I am not into a meal deal, so I only get a sandwich and for $5 even, it is worth it.  The owner TJ is very friendly and personable.  The staff that I have seen are professional and curteous.  I have never had a bad sandwich, but I am particular to #12 (roast beef and Avocado) Yum!"}
{"text":"Had pastrami. Good quality meat-excellent bread. Macaroni salad was really good. Fast friendly service. I'll definitely be back...maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place to eat lunch for about a year now since I work down the street from the location. The sandwiches are extremely well priced yet the side items can be a bit expensive. $1.50 or so for about 10 or so grapes. They've made some very recent changes to their staff which has severely decreased the level of service expectations. I've been there 3 times this past week and received negative service quality each time. It has been very disappointing. But that won't stop me from going as the sandwiches are definitely \"worth the weight\"."}
{"text":"Went to the paint store and while the paint was being mixed I stopped in to get some grub. I was very impressed, the bread was fresh, the meat was piled high and the fixins were good. I got it with everything and it wasn't overly sloppy or soggy. Only reason it didn't get 5 starts was the ice machine had no ice for ice tea, that kind of sucked."}
{"text":"High quality sandwiches made with love, great staff, a variety of fresh yummy iced teas and side salads, drive thru, clean and good prices."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are just alright.  I grew up in the Bay Area where sandwiches are top notch so I have high expectations.  Finding good bread, which makes or breaks a sandwich, in Arizona is the challenge and this bread is just okay.  I have been here twice with same results so to me it isn't anything special to go out of the way for at this time.  Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! The owners really brought this old building back to life! Finally there's a fresh sandwich option on this side of the airport in Phoenix. Yum!! We love the Sparky and the Sky Harbor sandwiches with everything on it."}
{"text":"I frequent here on my work lunch break and I love their sandwiches! The hoagie roll they use is really soft with some sweetness to it and they always pack on the meat and veggies. They also have great salads that are quite a good size that you can just pick up from their fridge up front. I have a desk job, so I try not to eat fast food very often and this place is perfect for a quick and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Finally a good sandwich place around here. Has a northeast feel to it and bread is good. Nice specials through out the week. I'll be eatting here a lot"}
{"text":"The guy at the counter messed up my wife's order and when she went back to have it corrected the manager said \"it is not my fault she can't read the menu\" and refused to help in anyway. I have been going here for years, even prior to the location change but I will never go back. Wife threw out the sandwich and left. What a waste of nine dollars!"}
{"text":"I use to work across the street from this place and would only go for convenience on super busy days that I needed a quick lunch. The reason is that the service is horrible and the food is alright but nothing special. I read the reviews and just laughed out loud because they are so true you really can't make this stuff up we had running stories at the office about who can top each crazy stories about this place. The strict restrictions are presented very abrasive and the funny part about that is when you are able to add on and pay for extras your order is missing what you asked for and you have to wait longer to get it right the second time or refunded. At some point I decided it was not worth the trouble no matter how close it was to the office I did not return."}
{"text":"5/17 update: THEY MOVED! but only a stones throw away from the old location . Sharing the spot with the amazing Docs artisan ice cream! Bigger, better and Still the same great grub but now with gelato options!!! DO THIS   This is just simple solid delish food.   One good way to tell a great lunchtime sandwich place is if the parking lot has cop and fire vehicles in it. (This place is actually right across from a fire station, so those guys have it easy!) It's not uncommon to also see several UPS trucks, plumbers, trades folks and all other walks of life.   The product is so loaded up and fat that it's almost hard to eat! This is a good problem to have. Easily the best sandwich place in the Tukes and the greater I-10 n Ray part of the valley for that matter. Nondescript yet comfortable semi hidden little suite next to a trophy and insurance business.   The menu features 24 sandwich combos on their signature soft chewy rolls. They serve mostly just Sammy's but chili is great too.    Sorry I rushed this review but no matter. If you're in the area and hungry for a sandwich, just head over. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here yesterday. I often visit the location in Tempe for lunch from work so I know the food and selection of sandwiches is great,  However, this located was very poorly organized, the seating was limited and the hair was obviously not set low enough. The line to order is located down a narrow walkway towards the back of the shop.   I will stick with grabbing lunch at the location by place of business. :-("}
{"text":"This shop is right down the street from where I work. We all eat here every Friday (taking orders from everyone in our department because everyone knows it's that good!) , and it has never disappointed! Best bread and dressing on the sandwiches, and you get SO MUCH meat on each sandwich! Their lasagna soup is also 5 stars, when they have it available. I would highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time and had their Wed university sandwich special which was just Ok. When I checked in with yelp a Free cookie deal popped up so I went back up to the counter to get my cookie for desert. When I showed the cashier my yelp coupon she rudely said that I needed to purchase something to receive the free cookie. After informing her that I had just made a purchase we had to go through this big ordeal of finding my order in the system and reprinting the receipt. Once she finally got the receipt she said sorry but we are all out of the free cookies. When I suggested that maybe they give me one of the other cookies that they had piles of she flatly said No and stated that they are no longer honoring the Yelp Free cookie deal anyway. So my 1st time was my last visit to this crazy rude place."}
{"text":"Wow! Found this on Yelp. I ordered the Sparky. Meant to get the wrap, but glad I didn't. Their bread is to die for!!! Definitely come hungry. I chose the potato salad for my side. The entire meal was awesome and I'm stuffed. I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"25¢ for a water cup with the purchase of a sandwich. I doubt the food tastes good enough to forgo water to wash it down. I won't be finding out."}
{"text":"Meh. I know this place boasts east coast style sub but I beg to differ. Prices are great, service is good. I got a turkey bacon with provolone. I could barely find the cheese on my sandwich, the piece was so tiny. I thought the bread and the mayo were both lacking flavor. Overall not an East Coast style sub, but if you don't know any better I guess it's ok."}
{"text":"Cool little spot for a quick and fresh tasting sandwich. Ordered the University which was the special for the day. The veggies tasted  fresh and it had the perfect meat to veggie to sauce ratio. I very much enjoyed my sandwich from here and will be coming back to try the others."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've had several sandwiches and they all have been excellent and loaded to the max with meat. The bread is fresh and chewy and nicely compliments the fillings. The service is normally fast and friendly, even during the lunch rush frenzy. One of the things I like most about this establishment is the tax is already included on their listed menu prices, score!  On their combos you can select your choice of macaroni salad, potato salad, fruit or chips- You gotta love variety. The sandwich is so large honestly I wouldn't recommend getting a side unless you have a behemoth appetite. One thing I wish they would change is their cookies, they use the Otis Spunkmeyer brand but I'm sure they can make something better than that in house."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch sometimes. Never fails, the sandwiches are always great. The bread is sweet and the meat is quality. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Recently used them again for a work luncheon. The sandwich tags were amazing. Every sandwich was perfect and made to order. Loved it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a mini vacation after flying in from LA and waiting for the Hyatt to get our room ready we came across this Sandwich company, figured it had to be tasty due to the fact it's near the university and around tons of business. I think the best part of my meal was the bread I ordered #17 ( Arizona philly) the meat was a bit dry and bland what gets me is the sandwich comes with \" standard toppings\" cheese, mayo, onions & mushrooms that's a philly they charged us 50 cents for \"add on toppings\" when the picture and description clearly shows those at \" standard toppings\" (upset over 0.50 !? Your damn right) My hubby got #18 and I believe that's a pastrami sandwich once again \" standard toppings \" mustard & pickle they charged us 0.50 for his pickle ( lol just to be clear his pickle is worth way more) his pastrami meat was also a bit dry .. Not sure if the meat is always dry. Or  my taste buds are spoiled from juicy meat?   but we will not order those sandwiches again maybe a turkey avocado club so they can charge me 0.50 for my avocado .."}
{"text":"Had to walk out of this place because they wouldn't do a side of meatballs for my daughter who doesn't eat the bread. First the lady at the counter said she wouldn't know how to do it. My wife told her to just put the meatballs in a bowl. She said she didn't have bowls. My wife told her that they must have soup bowls. Then she said she didn't know how to charge it. I told her just charge me a meatball sandwich, but just don't give me the bread. She said she can't do that. Unbelievable. Apparently it's too hard for them to put meatballs in a bowl instead of on a piece of  bread. We walked out and went elsewhere. All sandwich shops we've been to are able to do this, and they even charge me less. Obviously not a very customer friendly place. First and last time walking into this place."}
{"text":"The subs are great! Super Fresh food. Never a bad sandwich"}
{"text":"First off, they have tall tables but no chairs. Not a huge deal unless you want to sit while eating. Second, when asked if I could have a cup for water I was told no. The reason was \"in this neighborhood I can't be handing out cups of water because of the transients.\" I guess it didn't matter that I was an actual paying customer. Third, the neighborhood is sketch."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Sandwiches are solid and include lots of meat! Pre-made salads are good but you need to get there early. Reasonable prices. Expect a line but don't let it deter you. It will move fast."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places in town! I love that their onions are super thinly sliced and their house dressing is so amazing!"}
{"text":"First review of the new year, so I figured I'd finally review one of my favorite lunch places! I was told about Arizona Sandwich Company by a colleague of mine and it's really dangerous that they're a fairly short drive from where I work! I've been here a few times now & their sandwiches have been so good.  I've tried the Sparky, the plain turkey, and also the Italian Grinder. Their sandwich ordering system works as follows: you pick a sandwich type, so basically the meat and cheese (or vegetarian) and then at the register they ask what you want on it. Everything on it means you get lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese, mayo, onions, mustard, and dressing. You can opt to get all/some/none of these. Each time I've gotten everything on my sandwich and it has been pretty packed and delicious! Sometimes their bread is a little on the dry side, so I wish that were better.  If you get one of the sandwiches that starts off at $5 & upgrade to a meal with a bag of chips & a large drink, the total comes out to only about $7 and some change! I think that's definitely a more than fair price for what you get since the sandwiches are large. I normally can eat only about half!  It gets really busy at lunch time, so I recommend going in before noon crowd. They're pretty fast at getting orders out though so you probably won't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"I'm really sad that they chose this location for their phoenix location. I absolutely love their sandwiches. BUT this location falls short on a lot of things.  The location sucks.  The people that make the sandwiches, 2 out the 3 times, haven't made them correctly (like the tempe location). They are skimpier on the ingredients. When I'm getting a veggie sandwich, please don't skimp me on the veggies in the sandwich. I don't want to just eat bread and cheese.  There is this woman that works at the counter and she is such a CRAB. 0 customer service skills. On my last visit there, she was telling off the guy in front of me. He was a paying customer, but had a bit of change for the payment of his sandwich. She was giving him crap, mocking, taunting him. then she said \"I'm not your bank\". Since when are quarters not legitimate payment. Crazy. She was also rude to me. Prior to that experience, she was also rude. Also, it's not a cozy environment. I don't understand how anyone would want to eat their sandwiches standing up. They don't have chairs."}
{"text":"This place has THEE best veggie sandwiches. I'm a vegetarian and it's hard for me to \"fall in love\" with a sandwich.  Their bread is phenomenal. It is soft, fluffy, and tastes amazing.  The oil with herbs that they put on the sandwich, as well makes it amazing. Really yummy.  So, my girlfriend gets meat sandwiches from there and she loves them too. Their macaroni salad is good too. The only negative thing is that they close so early lol, but I understand."}
{"text":"If you get a meal, go with the potato salad for a side. It's really good."}
{"text":"Really delicious bread and decent portions. I had the meatballs which were flavorful and juicy.   Definitely looking to try more of their sandwiches"}
{"text":"It's good for a quick meal.  I say 2.5 stars.  Friendly staff and fast service.  Food is about average."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just really hungry or maybe this was actually a great sandwich.  I'm going with the later.  I had just gotten done shooting a TFCD with a model at a studio down the way.  Holy cow, talk about a 'hot' shoot.  Oh man.    But I was really, really hungry afterward.  This place was just a stone throw from the place I was shooting at.  During my visit there was only one guy working the counter and making the sandwiches.  That would be my main gripe.  He saw me standing at the counter but gave me the 'I'll be right with you' line.  He wasn't being a jerk about it but it did take him about five minutes to finish what he was doing before taking my order.  I decided on the ATC (advocado, turkey and cheese) and it was great.  I loved the bread and the toppings.  Normally, I'm not much of a mayonnaise person but I decided to roll the dice and let them make the sandwich as they do.    I had the 6 inch and it was $4.50 exactly just like it said on the menu.  It was definitely filling.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I miss great sandwiches. This definitely isn't the same but is best thing I've found so far. I pick up lunches here all the time for the office and I can't wait to use them instead of Paradise Bakery for a sandwich platter."}
{"text":"This place is OK, but I wouldn't go again. The bread was incredibly dry. There are a thousand choices and a long line that is rushed along. When I got to the front I felt panicked. I ended up getting the trusty #1 (Turkey). All their sandwiches come with thousand island dressing and mayo and mustard, etc. That was the only unique thing I could notice. Only one size sandwich.   Biggest plus? Their drinks are huge and they have a coke machine. They also have ice cream in a freezer if you want dessert."}
{"text":"I stopped in after a shopping trip and I was starving. I ordered a club combo and waited patiently for my order. The girl behind the counter didn't tell me where I could get side or what options I had to me. A few firemen ordered after me and she totally went the extra mile to help them, make recommendations, etc. When my sandwich was done, she called my name. She just pushed my sandwich towards me and that was it. I asked for a bag so I could carry my sandwich and side and she just tossed me a used bread bag. I don't know what was up that girls ass today, but I clearly was the one she chose to treat like crap. There for was OK. I would have given 3 stars for that. The service was unexcusable."}
{"text":"Very clean.  Very fresh sandwiches.  Clearly a very well run operation - run by people who care.  The bathroom was very clean - I always love to see that.  The place looks organized.  My sandwich was truly delicious and the bread was fresh.  I stopped in just by chance as I was hungry when returning from the airport.  I am glad I did!  If I was going to make any suggestions for  management, I would recommend that they add more tables - and improve the comfort level (and style of) the tables/chairs (the existing furniture is extremely basic).  I would also improve the signage - the only reason I found this place on a Saturday is because I was driving by and saw a little lighted sign that said \"OPEN\".  I almost missed that little sign...."}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich! It's the real deal piled with your favorite meats and veggies! I had the Sparky, a really great and flavorful sandwich with potato salad!  I highly recommend stopping if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches-staff remembers your name-fast service-cozy little place should you want to stay and eat.  I saw one of my co-workers eating this huge sandwich in our lunch room...FINALLY a place where you don't have to order double meat just to be able to 'see' what meat you DID order!  Will go back again.  Right down the street from US Airways"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, good size portions and quick efficient service.  My recommendation for anyone wanting a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been eating in the area for a few months now and I'm so upset that I only just found the Arizona Sandwich Co. The service is great and super fast and the sandwiches are amazing! This is now officially my favorite lunch spot in the valley!"}
{"text":"No lunch rush on Sunday afternoon. Place was empty of students and I had my turkey, avocado and cheese in minutes. Pretty good sandwich - the turkey quality might have been a tiny level below Boars Head, but still whatever it was, it worked well. They did not skimp on the avocado (more like guacamole) either and the combo was $7.25 with chips/drink. The better deal is just to get the sandwich for $4.50 and some water from the freestyle machine. I do love Mello Yello and they don't sell Mello Zero in stores, so for me, finding it in that machine made for an even better lunch. Lots of grab and go salads too that might have some potential, depending on how long they have been in the case. Good spot, especially with no crowds."}
{"text":"Wow.  This beats any subway or jimmy johns hands down !!!! Everything is fresh and the bread is to die for"}
{"text":"this place is super inexpensive and really fast, great place to take a quick lunch break"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Simple request of wheat bread instead of white bread and we were denied because the person in the back put mayo on the white bread already. Maybe you should offer your customers options instead of making assumptions. That is not how you treat your $20 paying customer. We had to change our order completely in order to get one sandwich on wheat. Complete crap service. The girl at the counter did not care at all. We will never be back nor will any of our friends or family.  Meanwhile, while we ate our sandwiches we watched the same girl have attitude with an older couple, refuse to give older gentleman the wifi password, and refuse to walk their sandwiches to them. Really??? I also watched the girls ignore the customer in the drive through for at least 5 minutes, which I've also experienced first hand... Then to top it off both girls were on their phones in front of customers, there really is no professionalism here and I get it, it's a sandwich shop, but we're still paying clients. Have a little decency and at least be polite."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Small dining area. I am not a fan of their bread. Too soft and squishy. Wanted whole-wheat but they were out. Nice amount of filling just don't like the bread."}
{"text":"Suuuper delicious sandwiches at a great price, and warm and friendly staff. Perfect stop for when you step off a plane feeling famished after a trip...even better for bringing a big fat sammy with you on the plane ;) They have an impressive variety of snack and desserts too"}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches, snacks, and beverages. Perfect little sandwich shop with good prices. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot. The Italian is great but the sparky is my favorite so Far. I have been here about 10 times. Every time I'm hungry I think about how fresh and delicious this place is. See you again today"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this great sandwich shop. I got the #5 sub sandwich...basically the italian sub. The sub was full of meat and their special sauce was so good. It was some sort of garlic and vinegar sauce. They have a lot of choices and the subs are affordable."}
{"text":"I tried the Tuna sandwich for the first time and I was very impressed with flavor and freshness of bread. You get a great value for your money. Location is very convenient and close to my job.   Update May 2016 My favorite sandwich is the Sparky which contains turkey, bacon, avocado and cheese simply the best and they have fresh bread. Fast and Friendly service."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Phoenix and this is an early favorite of mine. Their sandwiches are tasty, filling and well priced. Their daily special is always hard to pass up as it is always a delicious sandwich for a reasonable price. I think I will be frequenting this place for quite some time."}
{"text":"I work about a mile from this sandwich shop, and a lot of my coworkers eat there regularly. I've had their sandwiches a few times, and agree with previous poster, they make HUGE sandwiches! Plus they are GOOD! The counter-lady remembered my name, from the few times I've been in.  I've had hot and cold sandwiches, both excellent.  (The only reason I didn't give 5stars, is they have Coke products rather than Pepsi.)"}
{"text":"Ordered the AZ Philly. This consisted of seasoned beef, mushrooms. Onions cheese and mayo.  While the meat was tasty. The sandwich was so dry.   Asked for BBQ sauce or anything that would add some moisture to it and the only response was \"we only have soy sauce\". While the meat was tasty the dryness overwhelmed the sandwich"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, we popped in here today for a quick lunch before heading to AZ Mills and had delicious sandwiches! Thanks to Yelp for pointing our sandwich-craving bellies in the right direction!  I ordered the turkey, avocado, and cheese sub with all the fixins' {provolone, onions, tomato, lettuce, mayo, dressing}. It was so yum! They also had these Boulder Jalapeno Cheddar potato chips that were to die for. But one of my favorite parts of the lunch was probably the unsweetened Peach Cobbler black tea!! Guys, i'm not lying, it is an iced tea flavor, and it was dreamy.   If you're in the area and craving a sandwich, AZ Sandwich Co. won't disappoint! They have a variety of hot subs as well."}
{"text":"First time visiting, bought a #6 (turkey, ham and bacon). Only complaint is that I did wait 5 to 10 minutes at the drive-thru window before speaking to anyone, but it was during lunch rush, and my sandwich did come out soon after ordering.   This is exactly what I wish Subway 6-inch sandwiches tasted like. Wheat bread is soft, thick and semi-sweet. Meat and veggies tasted fresh and were generously portioned. Would recommend and will likely visit again."}
{"text":"Food is decent, better then fast food. Service sucks in a big way. I ordered 4 sandwiches and a soup and when I asked for large sandwiches I swear to god the world was about to end. No way, that's too much at once! I changed my order to regulars and the sigh of relief was heard next door I'm sure. A man eating there struck up a conversation with me while I was waiting and the little 16 year olds behind the counter didn't like that! They continued to yell my name again and again, it's not busy.. At all! The looks I get from the bigger, chubby guy are priceless. He wants to kill people for ordering sandwiches, it's ok bud! It's your job. I had ordered a couple weeks ago(they lost my order in 20secs, big boy gave it to the wrong person) and the girl couldn't use the register, 2 weeks later as I'm waiting in the drive thru to pick up the order I called in 20 minutes ago is being made she still couldn't use the register!   I know good employees are hard to find but come on..."}
{"text":"Pretty quick and tasty food. Reasonably priced and big portions. Parking is difficult and the restaurant is packed during lunch.  I am disappointed in them for writing a message on the pop machine today that said ice machine is not working but soda is still cold! It was NOT cold, luke warm at best, so I felt duped into buying a drink that I wouldn't have if they wouldn't have lied.  I want to give this place a 3, but it is too solid, it deserves a 4."}
{"text":"I walked in ordered a daily special. It was pastrami day. Super hungry, I was asked if mustard, pickle, and cheese were good (so I WAS given an option). I said yes and I would like lettuce, tomato, and mayo. They said No!!! Lol I'm still laughing. I asked why and two employees said it's just the way the owners want it. I'm a paying customer consuming this food. I want lettuce tomato and mayo. Employee said it was their store and their recipe.  WOW, I'm insulted. But hey, there are other sandwich shops that don't mind if you put \"A1 on their steaks\".  SUPER LAME ATITUDES. Moving on....."}
{"text":"So. This place is good. The bread seems to be fresh. The ingredients are fresh. My only issue is the \"add avocado\" or \"add bacon\". The avocado and bacon on the sandwiches are very slim. When you add bacon, you get a slim...one piece. He bacon is obviously microwaved and very thin. Overall a good substitute for subway."}
{"text":"We have frequented this place for years. Love an ATC on wheat! Big sandwiches for a good price and easy to customize!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and the price is right.  I'm a fat boy and I filled up on a $7.75 \"Sparky combo\" ASU supported,  Pussy Cat fans need not apply ;-)"}
{"text":"Well nothing bad to say. The place was great. They had a soup of the day which was Potato Bacon which I got a cup of. It was good. I also got a sandwich that was so good. They were fast and efficient. These are heavy sandwiches but they also have wraps and salads which I will have to try next time I stop by. Because the sandwiches were good and of course I like soup so that works for me to have a place that has soup!"}
{"text":"I got the club sandwich weekend 7.75 special.  It was very good. Had a side of potato salad, which was really good also. It's about a 6 inch sandwich, which is plenty. I'm still stuffed hours later!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The manager (and/or owner?) came around to my place of work a couple weeks ago and dropped off some menus. I usually throw those kinds of things away but he was so nice I decided to keep the menu in my desk drawer.   I usually bring my lunch but forgot it today. I was trying to think of where could I possibly go when I remembered the menu. I checked it out and it all sounded good so I decided to stop in. I got the Sparky on wheat with everything, plus chips and drink for about $8. I don't know what else to say other than the sandwich is freaking delicious.  Way better than subway or goodcents.  The girls working were very nice and worked fast too.  I will definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place!  Sparky is my go to, but I've had a few others.  The bread, mmmmmmmm.  You can't beat the price too.  I love sandwiches, if you do too, go here and get one."}
{"text":"Good sandwich, but just good. Nothing extraordinary. I had the hot pastrami. But, I ordered the AZ Philly. I was too much in a hurry to correct the order  so I took it and went."}
{"text":"I am a serious regular here. The sandwiches are delicious and IMO, a cut above subway. That said, I am giving 2 stars today for several reasons. First, they have raised their prices. Cost of doing business I get it but they are clearly in process of a what looks like a purely aesthetic remodel. I thought it looked just fine before & don't see a benefit to me the customer for paying more? Suggestions would be: not charging extra for tiny items like adding cucumber or a side of dressing, or environmentally friendly cups. Second, I got the Club since it was the weekend combo special, the bacon tasted old. Should have stuck to my \"go to\" super British. Third, it is HOT in here! So I'm hoping the remodel includes an AC upgrade? Fourth, they had a new side dish: antipasto salad. Spoiler alert: it has green peppers in it. This is a personal taste thing, however, I don't get the macaroni salad or the potato salad because they have green peppers in them as well. Guess I'll stick to chips, meh. Lastly, they still have wi-fi but you can't use it. I quote \"we're not allowed to give it out anymore\". This was my go to lunch spot for the past few years. I liked to come by myself, get on my phone & get my sandwich fix. Today's experience was mediocre on many levels. It will be a while before I come back. Ps- classic rock is dusty & my pic that was taken 6 months ago is not on the wall."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their bread is always fresh and soft, they don't skimp on the meat and the staff is always friendly. I've made the mistake of getting my sandwiches at other outfits before....never again! This place never disappoints :)"}
{"text":"As the Duke of Arizona Sandwich Company for most of the last 3+ years, I hate to report that the value of the products they offer is now going down hill. When I review places I've always valued quality over quantity, and in this case their quantity was always decent for the money. On tonights visit, which was the first in a while, I found that the quantity has shrunk to below a good value. They have not raised prices, but they have shrunk their sandwich sizes, and all of the fixings as well. I know cost are going up, but I guess I'd rather see them raise the price a little, rather than shrink the products.   I also had a salad tonight, and it was very weak for a $6.50 salad. the Romaine hearts were mostly large stems, and the lettuce was not cut into anything close to bit sized pieces. Eating a salad should not require the use of a knife to consume it. The salad was mostly lettuce, 6 small grape tomatoes, a small cup of cheese, chicken, and bacon bits. They even charged me an extra dollar for the house dressing. the worst part was the lettuce was very bitter, and the extra large chunks of romaine stem made it worse.   I guess nothing lasts forever, but I must admit I'm sad to say this may be my last trip to this establishment. $20 for two rather small sandwiches, and a nasty tasting salad is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Eat here today and I'm happy to report that the reviews are true. the sandwiches were excellent and it's definitely worth it to get the Italian dressing on your sandwich. I was a little skeptical but followed the suggestion. it was delicious. I had the Sparky my wife had the roast beef sandwich. both were delicious."}
{"text":"I visited on a recent trip to AZ and WOW, if you haven't been you have to go! GREAT options, affordable price, and the tastiest sandwich I've ever eaten! Great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner options!"}
{"text":"great value and a great sandwich!  don't order a large sandwich unless you're really really hungry. their sandwiches are HUGE!"}
{"text":"AZ Sandwich Co is directly across the street from our office building so I frequent this place. They're very clean and professional. They have specials everyday of the week. This place does get pretty crowded during lunchtime so you'll want to try to get in early. However, they are also pretty quick with orders.   There's a good amount of seating available if you want to dine in. They have all the utensils you'll need if you want to take your meal to go. If you're in a hurry try one of their ready-made salads."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my new job which I started about 2 months ago. I have ventured across the street about once a week during this time and have grown pretty fond of Arizona Sandwich Co.  This place surely beats the hell out of Subway which isn't saying that much but I rather pay the extra two bucks to eat here every time. My two favorites are the Sparky (turkey, bacon, and avocado) and the hot pastrami. I get my hot pastrami with jalapenos and not pickles because hey what can I say, I like it hot."}
{"text":"So I tried this sandwich place 3 times. I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Time #1 i ordered a grilled chicken caesar wrap, it comes to me with chicken salad..so not the same thing. We call, no apologies, just we are who we are. Time #2 I order a Phoenix, turkey, bacon, avocado and bacon, and its good, great times.. Time #3 I order the same Sandwich, and it arrives, a completely different sandwich!. I call to ask why I order the same thing and it comes completely different, and their answer is ...you ready...its OUR FAULT. I tell him we ordered the same way both times, their response, We weren't clear..Like WHAT!!!! I will never order again from a place that refuses to be responsible or listen to their customer. I'm done. Oh, and to boot, sandwiches are just good, not great."}
{"text":"Best deli sandwich I have had in a long time. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"best sandwich ive had in a while, first timer, i went in for the club special and i was not dissapointed! i was in love at first bite! i would definantly come back and i reccommend trying this place out if you havent already"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are wonderful! But don't bother with their breakfast; the breakfast burritos are horrible!! I ordered a chorizo, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito that was served with cold, stale potatoes, small crumbles of chorizo, rubbery eggs, and a dash of shredded, unmelted, cheese. I could have enjoyed a much better tasting breakfast burrito out of the vending machine! Don't waste your time or money! You may want to consider McDonald's instead, and that is saying a lot!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches from the Arizona Sandwich Co. are absolutely amazing.  If you are even thinking about going to one of those chain restaurants for a sandwich, then please do yourself a favor and change your plans immediately.  If you are within 5 miles of either location, it is worth the drive.  I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.  I have only taken sandwiches to go, and only on three occasions, but each sandwich was a masterpiece.  The sandwiches are actually too delicious, if that's possible.  The meat, cheese, bread and condiments are super fresh and of the highest quality.  The portions are generous and the prices are ridiculously cheap for what you get.  The only reason that I am the least bit hesitant to write this review is because I don't want anything to change - especially the low prices.  If you are in the mood for a sandwich, and you are within driving distance of either location, turn your car around and go there now!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Arizona Philly it looked good but when I bite into it. I put mustard instead of mayo plus the meat didn't have any seasoning. Smh never coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Everything is fresh. We drive up from Casa Grande because it is that good."}
{"text":"I had the delicious chicken club avocado meal. I like how the options for sides aren't just chips, but potato salad, macaroni salad and grapes too! My sandwich was wonderful. I would give them 5 stars but I've only had one thing off the menu so far so who knows. I got a side of their house dressing to dip my sandwich in. Really good."}
{"text":"Got the University (#11). Bread was soft and delicious, toppings were fresh. Love the house dressing. A great sandwich, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of those hole in the wall spots in an industrial park setting.  Basically you may not even know they are there until a friend or coworker tells you about it.  I'm glad that they did! Aside from being in a nondescript location they have tremendous sandwich options!  For my first foray into their offerings I went with the Sparky, a mouth watering sandwich with turkey, bacon and avocado.  Since I'd gotten the sandwich in the Shorty Combo I was able to get some macaroni salad as a side.   If you don't like a heavy mayo taste in your macaroni salad I would advise against it as a side.  The potato salad or chips make an equally appetizing side.  If you're going there for lunch be sure to go early or later than 12 since the seating is limited inside of AZ Sandwich Co.  I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and food.  Clean and nice location and wonderful staff.   So glad they are close by my office for lunch."}
{"text":"I thought the ATC (Avocado, Turkey and Cheese) was a bit better at Submarina, in my hometown of San Diego, but this sandwich was by no means a bad one. Service was friendly and very fast - the six inch sandwich seemed smaller than what I am used to, but that might have just been my perception. I think I would try it again and see what another sandwich was like."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop near my job.  They offer great salads and have gluten free wraps too.  Service is super fast and the staff is always friendly.  Highly recommend the salads to go or the Sparky sandwich or wrap."}
{"text":"I had training nearby and I was recommended by the instructor.  This place is in a suite so you need to look for the suite number on the door.  The location isn't really visible; it blends in with the nearby suites.    I was hungry and I saw hot pastrami since it was so cold today.  I got the Shorty combo and got the side of potato salad.   I had the choice of Chips, Grapes, Potato or Macaroni Salad.  It also came with a drink and I got some fresh brewed black ice tea.  The sandwich was pretty big.  It was warm and toasty but the bread seems to be too soft.  The picture of the Hot pastrami did not look like anything what I got.  I was a bit disappointing.  It seems like regular deli pastrami.  The mustard was not spread out evenly; one end had too much mustard.  The sandwich came with spears of pickles and the pickles were a bid tad too salty for me as well.  The potato salad was alright too, it tasted a bit bland for me but not bad.  I think they make it.  Overall, the Hot Pastrami was mediocre.  I might try something else next time.  I also didn't know they had wheat bread; I would totally get that instead of white.  The sandwich variety is great selection.  They also have salads for the vegetarian.  They also have a wide variety of juice and soft drinks that are not from the tap.  They also do catering and the staff was friendly.  ***you can phone in your order and they have a stamp card for frequent sandwiches**   It's A-OK to me, but don't take my word for it.  **parking** I think they have a small lot for you park  **cash or credit**"}
{"text":"I had book marked this place almost a year ago because of the high rating and was super excited to try it! Unfortunately, it didn't quite it the mark for me. I ordered the Sparky (turkey, bacon and avocado) with the potato soup on the side. The sandwich seemed a bit runny to me- maybe oil or vinegar? The bread was good, but the ingredients didn't seem overly fresh. The soup was a bit heavy in fat and definitely upset my stomach afterward. It was a little pricey for a sandwich that wasn't great quality. I'd recommend checking out a more fresh sandwich joint in the area."}
{"text":"The lady at the register was very very rude. The owner should try to give her some customer service training.  I just asked if she could put the turkey in the microwave for 30 seconds because I'm pregnant and she refused saying it was company policy.  She was totally rude and unapologetic.   I will never come back here again.  I think subway would have been a better choice. I try to support local businesses but this one was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Had I had better customer service, I probably would have given this place 5 stars. The woman at the cash register was extremely unfriendly, and when she accidentally rang in the wrong sandwich I couldn't even get a small apology. I wasn't mad to begin with because everyone makes mistakes, but when working in customer service a small apology goes a long way.  That being said, if you're looking for your basic tasty lunch sandwich, great place to come."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  I got the sparky and it was very good and filling.  The sandwich after tax and all was only about $5.  Great food, great service.  I'll be back for more for sure."}
{"text":"I have never ever ever been disappointed in their sandwiches. I haven't even tried half the sandwiches and I can't wait to have them all!! So far my favorite is the Az Philly. Perfection. The employees are awesome as well! Very kind and inviting! My co-workers also love this place. One of them often gets the Chef Salad and she loves it! I would get extra dressing though, as the salads are HUGE! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just Love this place, super friendly staff, great meats and mix of sandwiches and the bread is always soft and fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich shop in ahwatukee  not a big name so I think a loot of people pass it up but if your hungry and close by give it a try. They have great bread and big portions for decent price"}
{"text":"Walked in for a quick lunch meal to go.  Greeted with hello's and smiles. Welcome to Arizona Sandwich Company.  Got a drink, potato salad, and plus the  Combo of the Day    $7.99 for the #11 University.  Turkey/Ham/Roast Beef Sub, Side & Fountain Drink. Good stuff! Nice to have another lunch spot.   Fresh baked soft-as-a-pillow bread from a local bakery, load it up with thinly sliced premium meat and fresh cut veggies, and top it off with our signature blend of House Dressing.  Good job Y'all!

Typically, remote destinations where the journey of Fishing, Kayak Fishing, Hunting, Camping is the principal goal with, some shenanigans thrown in."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh, lots of meat. They don't skip on ingredients. They offer a good selection of sides from potato salad, macaroni salad and a great selection of potato chips. They have the new Coca-Cola soda machine with lots of beverage choices as well.    Support family businesses."}
{"text":"I had been here a few times due to how good the sandwiches were, and how nice the workers had always been to me, but the other day as i was enjoying my meal, i overheard a customer tell the manager that his sandwich had the wrong type of meat or something, no big deal right? they changed the guys sandwich, but the manager goes to the man who made the first sandwich and tells him that that's going to be HIS LUNCH, after the manager & customer both touched it? The manager was SO rude and the employee politely denied the sandwich and the manager told him he WAS going to have it. The employee threw it away which only left the manager in even more rage. I was left in shock and honestly i couldn't believe what i had witnessed. I didn't even finish my food because I was so disgusted with the management. The employees have always been sooo nice, I can't believe the way the manager talks to them."}
{"text":"Best sandwich out there! Fresh ingredients, friendly staff & good price."}
{"text":"It is fast and fresh, but the past few times I have asked for a pickle on my sandwich (which they charge you extra for) and did not receive it. I normally just get it to go and leave but I am starting to think I need to inspect my sandwich before I walk out the door. Maybe spend a tad bit more time making sure orders are correct."}
{"text":"Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"Yum! I stumbled upon this place on my way home from the airport the other day thanks to Yelp! I may have not found it otherwise as it was tucked away in a little mall. Arizona Sandwich Company did not disappoint! The bread was soft and fresh and they did not skimp on the toppings. Sandwiches made the way you want them- you can choose your own toppings. I even got a free cookie for checking in on Yelp. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and super budget friendly. I have tried just about everything on the menu and cant say one bad thing."}
{"text":"I recently started working not far from here and found this place on Yelp.  I've been here 5 or 6 times now over the last couple weeks and this place rocks.  The sandwiches are SO good.  The bread is soft and delicious.  I have tried the Arizona Philly, the meatball, the club, and the All American.  All of them have been delicious but I am partial to the Philly and the All American so far. They've been pretty busy every time I've been (except on Sunday) but they move through the lines quickly and the make your sandwiches pretty fast.  Excellent place and the prices are fantastic!  I look forward to eating many more sandwiches in the future!"}
{"text":"I went to the Arizona Sandwich Company today for the first time. I got the 6 inch #6 Club for $6, with the standard dress minus red onion. It was a delicious and filling sandwich. The bread was fresh and soft. The turkey and ham were bountiful, but there wasn't very much bacon. The sandwich was made to my specifications correctly.   The only con would be that I went to the drive-through window. There isn't a speaker system like most drive-throughs, so I pulled up behind the customer in front of me. Once he got his order, I pulled up to the window, and waited for almost 5 minutes before someone came to the window to take my order.  With taking a little longer than some other places being the only down side, I will be back again."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and stumbled on this place.  Great place to grab a sandwich. .  bread was soft and tasty!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while attending a training at the Hilton nearby. There are daily combo specials which offer a variety of selections from the regular menu. Options for both hot and cold sandwiches and several options for sides - chips, potato salad, macaroni salad, fruit and sweets. There is not a ton of room to sit and eat so consider taking your food to go. Most of the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Best deli sandwich around Ahwatukee.  Bread is a little soft for my taste, but still a good sandwich.  I will go back, but still looking for something in the phoenix area to rival my hometown favorite:  Bay Cities - http://www.yelp.com/biz/bay-cities-italian-deli-and-bakery-santa-monica"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot and great price! Staff is always friendly and good is prepared quick."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I had the all veggie sandwich and I'm not a vegetarian, just trying to avoid meat that week and it was pretty good, hit the spot.  I didn't miss the meat all.  I'll try something different next time though.  A lot of the items on the menu look good.  I'm especially curious about the breakfast burrito.  Something about the vibe makes me think they would make a killer breakfast burrito.  However, the thing I'm most impressed with is how quick they are.  Even with the lunch rush, we got our food within a couple of minutes.  I would go back."}
{"text":"4 stars.  Would get 5 but they aren't very accommodating.  I can't add lettuce and tomatoes to my pastrami sandwich?  And pay for it? What is this, a Seinfeld show? I work down the street and come here at least twice a week.  Come on owners, focus on your customers-"}
{"text":"I had a meeting with a client across the street from this place and I hopped my Yelp app to find lunch nearby.  Once again, Yelp did not disappoint.  The service was super friendly, everyone in the back prepping food looked happy.  I appreciate all the options instead of chips to accompany my sandwich. The sandwich was absolutely delicious, layers upon layers of tasty meats and toppings.  I don't usually like thick sandwich bread but is was the perfect density to make this an excellent sandwich.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everyone remembers the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld well there's a woman who works at this location who reminds me on him, she basically sucks.  I used to go to AZ Sandwich Company twice a week to get a custom salad. It was always difficult to get them to put what i wanted on it but now it's impossible. They have apparently decided to feature only 6 salads -NO SUBSTITUTIONS (so intense).  I asked if I could pay extra but no go.  She said that her kitchen couldn't handle it, that it was too complicated to customize a salad...no offense but has the intelligence level of people sunk so low that a person who works at a sandwich/salad shop can't manage to add turkey to a classic salad?  Since this is what you do for a living you'd think you'd try a bit harder.  Ah well I guess I'll just go to Sack Sandwichs down the road, they're more then happy to customize and you get a free cookie with every order."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I had been to a few other sandwich joints in the area and figured that this would just be another generic sandwich shop. Wrongggggg.  I got the #5 which is an Italian sandwich and some mac salad and both are killer. The sandwich was full of meat, tasty lettuce, and the dressing they put on are sooooo good. Mac salad was pretty normal and I like when places don't fill it with a bunch of crunchy ass random vegis.   I'd definitely go back and it was all under $10 with a drink too! I'm definitely full and they got my food out fast, even when they were busy!"}
{"text":"On our way to the airport we stopped here...seen it a bunch of times and wanted to give it a try.  We had the daily special, which we ordered since we weren't familiar with the menu- after ordering we realized that this isn't really a special as there is no decrease in price..haha oh well- made ordering easy on us.   To be honest, even after looking at the menu again I can't remember what we had-not that it wasn't good, but it wasn't very memorable. Most of their sandwiches have the same 4 ingredients..so they kind of all blur together. I thought for $7.50 the meal was a good value (came with a drink and a side). We actually split this meal and while I was full, my husband needed a bit more food.   As some other reviewers have noted- the filling, while ample, was not evenly distributed, so some bites were heavenly, and others were lacking in flavor.    The girl at the counter was on her phone the entire time, so we had to wait for her to put it down when we ordered- we noticed that this happened to most customers who came in while we were eating. She offered no greeting when we came in, and didn't say goodbye/thank you when we left."}
{"text":"This is a solid spot for lunch!  The service was great!  I got my food in a very timely manner.  My boyfriend and I LOVED the potato salad.  We also each enjoyed our sandwiches.  Mine had turkey, bacon, and avocado.  There was plenty of meat and the sub bread was really tasty and fresh.  They have lots of choices for both sandwiches and drinks. I also thought \"The Office Hero\" special was a clever deal.  You get 5 sandwiches with chips, cookies, and drinks for $30.  I don't work in an office, but if I did I would hop on that deal :-)"}
{"text":"This location is near my job and when I order lunch from AZ Sandwich Co. I always get the Phoenix since  it has everything I like on it and the garlic dressing that they put on their sandwiches is down right sinful!  The sandwiches are always fresh and the staff is friendly, I go in after 1 pm and have never had to wait. For the deliciousness you get the price is right for the sandwiches, I never get the combo because I drink water more than soda and I usually have chips at work."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! I go to both locations, depending where I am in the day, and wow- both have great service, friendly staff, and the sandwiches are phenomenal. The bread is so soft and fresh, and I love how the sandwiches are actually stuffed with meat- not just two measly pieces. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich shop! I usually go once a week. Their menu is quite extensive and they are always friendly with their customers. Their sandwich prices are very affordable considering the amount of food you get. We aren't talking that terrible crap Subway serves either, this is quality meat and produce. They're also open for breakfast. My breakfast burrito the other day was to die for. When you don't feel like grabbing a bag of chips, grab some of their amazing potato salad or pasta salad. Mmmmmmmmm... It's lunch time. I'm on the way!"}
{"text":"We work about 1/4 mile from this great little spot.  It used to be called the Brown Bag Sandwich shop and I ate there a few times a year.  Since they've been Arizona Sandwich Company, I've eaten there on average once a week, and for good reason.    All the sandwiches I've had are awesome.  The bread is so soft, it feels like a goose down pillow.  They hook you up with a healthy portion no matter what item you order.  The sides are delicious and the desserts look amazing too.  (I don't normally do desserts)  We are greeted by name now when we arrive which feels great.  The daily specials are a no-brainer.  Lately I don't even peruse the menu.  I just go with the daily special and have yet to be disappointed.    Here's a tip: follow them on FB and you can get a $2 sando if you're hot on the status updates.    I recommend checking this place out.  It's directly east, across the strees (52nd) from the QT on the corner of University/52nd.    The best part, is that I can get in/out in less than 15 minutes.  That really helps for people with very busy schedules.    See you there!"}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches. I get the #15 everyday and its delicious. Fast service even during busy times. I go here because I hate Jimmy Johns which gives you salad on bread and calls it a sandwich.   Here you get an actual sandwich."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich shop. The bread is so fresh and delicious too. It's not uncommon for me to eat there at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Best. Sandwich. In. Valley. Period.  I go 2-3x each week.  Yes, I know.  I'm a weirdo.  But that should tell ya something about their awesome-ness!   (an my entire office eats there at least once each week, too.)  People that know me, KNOW I know good lunch fare.  This is GREAT lunch fare.  Be sure to tell Renee (she's the girl at the register) that DON sent ya!!!"}
{"text":"well I'm not a huge sandwich guy, now i go once or twice a week, trying to eat better but its hard for me, but this place makes it a lot easier! i hate subway, jimmy johns is way to pricey for no dam reason, but here for 6 bucks you can get the freshest dam sandwich ever, the bread is amazing and i get the sparky or the phoenix every time. best sandwich in phoenix and for 6 bucks w tax you will not beat it, and everyone there is really nice! a must try for everyone for sure, if you don't you are missing out big time. i got my whole office hooked after there 1st bite!"}
{"text":"No frills sandwich place with quick service and decent food.  I got a cold sandwhich with chips and a drink.  They also have hot sandwiches and additional sides like potato salad.  Will definitely go back the next time I want a sandwich for lunch.  I might also try this place for breakfast one day - they have a breakfast burrito and coffee combo."}
{"text":"Thinking I would come in at the noon hour for a quick grab and take back to work to eat for lunch, I ran into a huge line. What was concerning how there was only one cashier taking everyone's order. This is inconvenient for the lunch crowd like myself that is expecting a transactional purchase with sub, chips & a drink. Luckily enough the line did eventually die down and the sandwich wait of my Sparky Sub (bacon,avocado, lettuce, tomato, and onions) was worth it! Being that I am a tea person, the flavored teas were delicious. The mango and passion tea mix was a nice blend to fulfill my palate!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait..  Dont be a idiot...there is a line for a reason   Food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible sandwiches, but not worth the poor service. It has been steadily declining the past year or so. Went there last Friday and waited a whopping 22 minutes for my sandwich. Why? Because the cashier was too inept to multi-task. Get some new management ASAP."}
{"text":"Easily a competent and fast sandwich spot for lunch but 4 stars? It's not mind blowing and the ambiance is on par with a Wendy's. There are maybe 10 two top tables crowded in this place.  Although they don't skimp on the avocado and the lunch meat is fresh tasting. The pasta salad looked delicious too but I couldn't fit it in."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. I was given the wrong sandwich so i called to let them know. Ashley answered the phone put me on hold then hung up on me i had to call back and explain again what happened. she told me they would remake it for me all i needed to do was pick it up. I get there.... i get no apology and she treats it like it was not their fault. Then she asks me for the first sandwich back because they need to trash it, so i give it back and she just hands me the correct sandwich like if nothing happened. Since i am on my lunch break i couldn't stay to talk to the manager, so i decided to call them on my way back to work and spoke to the manager Andrea. She was extremely rude and while i was explaining to her what happened she was talking to other people and did not care about my complaint and then informed me that most her employees were new and there was nothing she could do because they are still training. She never offered an apology till i brought it up.... i understand mistakes happen but they need to find a better way to handle situations like this."}
{"text":"Arizona Sandwich Co.  is a great hidden gem in the Phoenix area.  I used work in the area and would come here for lunch all the time.  Hands down a way better quality product and price compared to many many fast food sandwich chains.  You can get a great quality sandwich with fresh ingredients for around $6... Friendly staff as well.  Order the Italian Bomber!"}
{"text":"Nice sandwhich place as a great alternative to the chain sandwhich shops. Any sandwhich can be turned into a wrap so chose the veggie in a whole wheat wrap while my friend chose the hot pastrami. My wrap was meh but my companion loved the pastrami and said the bread was fresh and so tasty! Think I'll have to try the sandwhich version next time! They also have a wide selection of salads and cater their meals locally. The service is fantastic, very friendly and helpful, answering any questions and very patient with indecisive (yes me) customers. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot!!! I can eat here every single day of the week and still be happy with my choice.  My favorite sandwich is the Sparky and the chili is excellent.  This last time I went they had a different potato salad and I was not a fan at all.  The bread is always soft and everything i have tried has been perfect.  Everyone I introduce to this little place falls in love."}
{"text":"What a find!!!  The hubs and I needed a bite to eat before tackling ikea and this place was on point!!! It smelled so great walking up and we were greeted with such cheerful smiles when we walked it. We ordered from their diverse sandwich menu and only had to wait a handful of minutes.  In the meantime we got to choose our own sides and a drink and have those tide us over while our Sambo was made fresh.  The bread was soft but held the contents easily and their everything version of both sandwiches we got was the perfect compliment to the meats we choose. 5 stars for delicious food and friendly downhome atmosphere."}
{"text":"I probably eat here way too much. But dang, it's so delicious! The club is the best! The staff is great; always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"FIrst and last time to this establishment.  Got the special and it was not bad but the service was horrible.  After we were done, my wife wanted to take half of her sub home.  I already had a drink with my meal, but needed something larger to store the half sub for the long trip home.  I went to the clerk and asked if I could have or purchase a large cup to put ice in.  She asked someone in the back and they said to charge me, are you ready for this, \"$5 for one cup.\"  I was like WHAT??? You got to be kidding me. I would have paid a reasonable price, 50 cents or whatever, but $5.  That's more than what the drink costs if I were to have ordered it to begin with.   What a rip off. What a bad message this sent.  If this is any indication how they treat first time customers, I don't want anything to do with this place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. No complaints there. However, even though their hours of operation are catered to businesses in the area, you need to make sure you have PLENTY of time to go there during the lunch rush. They don't seem to know how to answer the phone so that you can place a pickup order instead. I literally called over and over and let it ring and ring (giving them plenty of time, as I know they are busy) and no one seemed to care enough to pick up.  **Update** they told us they turn their phone off. Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today and was impressed as soon as I walked in the door. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and gave great recommendations for my first sandwich experience there. The sandwiches themselves were delicious, piled high with meat, and you could taste the quality in literally every ingredient. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place been coming for a mimute.But what really makes me come back is the people. They recently have had a change in management. I'm a regular breakfast guy. And there new person Michelle. She makes a the best breakfast burrito. I've ever had. I've asked her secret and she says it. Love. That she puts Love into everything she makes. I believe she does. She's always smiling and her energy is what makes me keep coming back. You have a jewel not only does she take my order she cashes me and sereval people out. And goes and makes them.  With a smile on her face. Great food and great management is why I keep coming back. The EL JEFE Burritos is the way to go. Az. Sandwiches hold on to Michelle because I want to steal her from you for my restaurant."}
{"text":"It's that first bite. After working hard, I earned this amazing creation. I bought the chicken bacon avocado, #16 I think, with every thing on it. The picture speaks for its self. SMALL BUSINESS EVERYDAY!!"}
{"text":"Love the Philly Cheese steak! It's the best I've ever had so far here. Convenient place and quick."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I had really high hopes for trying this place out. My first complaint was the onion. I'm a huge onion lover and when the sandwich already comes standard with onion and I ask for extra get a couple of very thin strands I was so sad but it wasn't the end of the world. My next thought was the bread. The bread was ok, a little sweet and waaaaay too much of it. Potato salad was great and fast service."}
{"text":"First time here, had a chicken Caesar wrap and mango fresh brewed tea.  Very good lunch, fast friendly service.  The only improvement need I saw was the young man busing the tables wiped a particularly messy table onto the floor.  Your patrons don't want to walk through that nor do you want to have to clean that up at the end of the day!  Right now they don't have floor coverings on that end of the restaurant but it doesn't set a good precedent.   They have cameras so they should be able to review the activity and address it, Wednesday at 1:35.  The young man is going through training so he'll learn sooner or later.  Still a five star in my book to the fast and good food for lunch, fresh veggie's and chicken, but the Caesar dressing could have been slightly more than what was on the wrap, but it was still very good!"}
{"text":"My sandwich wasn't great but I should of siad no to the house dressing. I will try it again."}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches I treat myself with this mostly on Friday's because I love the Sparky Special! I found this place from word of mouth from a coworker and I continue to tell others about this amazing place. The prices are reasonable especially if you get the daily special. I would suggest going as early as possible because it will get busy around 11 and parking becomes a pain! You pick up your sandwich in the morning and eat it at lunch. Really convenient!"}
{"text":"Ive been driving by this place for years and finally decided to drop in.  Its very tiny, only 7 or 8 small tables. They have fridges w/ bottled drinks on one wall, as well as a display of salads and other quick pick up lunch items. Above that is their huge sandwich board.  Their options are vast, and most sound delicious. I went w/ a basic italian sub. When I got to the counter (the line went rather quickly) the girl at the register was very nice. I ordered, paid (decent prices!), and sat down w/ my husband to wait.  We waited for about 10 minutes, and had our food! I really liked my sandwich, and would definitely order it again.  I got the sense that if you come here once a week theyll know your name by week 2 and probably know your \"usual\" by week 4. This place is really nothing to bragg about inside, but it still boasts a homey atmosphere.  Stop in for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a tasty alternative to the big sandwich chains, this is it. Their sandwiches are big, fresh and super yummy. Last time I was in I got the chicken club with avocado - tons of chicken, bacon and of course, avocado piled on their fresher than fresh bread. Seriously their bread is so soft, it's like bread candy. All in all it was a filling sandwich that really hit the spot on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and only been open for two weeks.  I would highly recommend it. Sold Sandwich with great bread and a lot of meat!  Give it a go and I think you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I imagine most of you, like me, have grown bored and tired of national sandwich chain shops with the same blah sandwiches on blah bread with blah ingredients. Welcome AZ Sandwich Co. into the picture to turn your sandwich world upside down.   They have a few locations but I frequent the Warner location in Tempe right off the 10. Staff is always extremely friendly and always willing to suggest a new sandwich to keep things interesting. The shop itself is no frills with some coolers and picture of guests on the wall, but the sandwiches are the draw here, not the decor. Heck if the decor isn't your thing, they have a drive thru just for you!  The #19 Turkey and Bacon is my failsafe. Bread is incredibly soft and fresh. All their meats are shaved super thin (which I always appreciate) and I love that they load their sandwiches with mayo, mustard AND Italian dressing. A great combo if you've never tried it. All sandwiches come with cheese and you can't go wrong with a hot or cold sub. The pastrami is very good quality for a quick service sandwich shop. My only knock, would be the bacon is the cheap flimsy microwave kind (too many joints love serving this stuff though, not just here, and it's a disgrace to bacon). It's enough to get some bacon flavor into the overall picture of what your eating, but nothing I would let anywhere near a BLT.   PS - If you have a sweet tooth and their house baked chocolate chip cookies catch your eye on the counter, ask if they have any freshly baked ones coming out soon. You might get lucky and get a fresh one right out of the oven (sorry not free, you have to pay for it!). You'll thank me if you get to enjoy one of these."}
{"text":"There are a ton of sandwich places in Tempe and I've visited almost all of them. Arizona Sandwich Co. happens to be the closest one to where I work (except for Subway). Went there with some co-workers. Most of them really liked the sandwiches they got and I am sure a bunch of them will be back for more.   When we got there, they were out of some of their ingredients which was disappointing. I got the A.T.C which was surprisingly good. The ingredients were fresh. Wasn't a fan of the bread because it made the sandwich feel somewhat heavy, instead of light. A choice of breads would be excellent. I was impressed with the quality of the ingredients between the buns. The coke was mixed well. More indoor seating would be nice and bar stools would be a great place to sit if you are waiting for your sandwich to be prepared.   As for the other reviewer Jim's complaining about not being able to take leftovers home for dinner, all I have to say about that is \"what a cheap bastard\". In fact, I don't like how large their portions are. I wish they would reduce it to a manageable size as I am definitely not looking to eat my sandwich for leftovers. What generally happens when you take any kind of sandwich and leave it to set is that it gives the innards time to soak into the bread bun which leave it a soggy mess. That is why I don't eat sandwiches for leftovers period.   Their signage in the window pays off because I noticed the place from the road and we went and ate there with-in the week. All in all you can tell that they take time to prepare each sandwich unlike some sandwich shops where you are rushed through the door in an assembly line. More than likely I will be back for more. Hopefully the quality of the sandwiches at least remains consistent."}
{"text":"awesome friendly service, accommodating larger groups,  always great food and nice people!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I recently tried this place after finding it on Yelp. It's really not bad for a sandwich place, but in my opinion it wasn't great either, really nothing special. I had the chicken club and it was very standard. My friend was rather frustrated when he asked for some lettuce to be put on his Reuben sandwich and was told that they can't modify any of the sandwiches. I mean really. you can't take a handful of lettuce and put it on there?   Also, there is minimal seating here."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches.  The bread is really good and the prices are very fair.  I've driven by this place dozens of times and always thought \"I wonder if that place is good.\" Now I know and it'll make it's way into the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I work down the road from this place and stop in every so often, primarily because I avoid fast food.  The sandwiches are stuffed with a lot of meat, and the ingredients are fresh.  My favorite is the sparky. Great place to visit, especially if you are trying to eat on the healthier side.  This place has gradually made improvements inside the building over the years, so they location keeps getting better.    Prices have gone up a bit since the minimum wage increase, but you can still get a combo meal for about 10 bucks (includes sandwich/drink/your choice of chips,potato salad, or fruit) which is actually a really good deal for the quality of food, and competitive enough to other places in the area  4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons  -set up could be better, not really a lot of room to wait for food, or many tables...but obviously the space is limited in a small building  -changed the recipe of the potato salad, used to be much better   And the Arizona Philly is good, I personally like it every now and again, but if you are looking for an east coast style philly, do not order it, it is very different (I just added this to my review for other people's knowledge)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week when I had training in Tempe and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of my University club sandwich in a seemingly unassuming business. It's in the middle of an industrial park so unless you're looking for it, it can be hard to discover. A major plus is the Coke Freestyle machine and the ability to swap a side of chips for potato or macaroni salad. The ingredients within the sandwich were fresh and the price was on point for what you get. If you are in the mood for a sandwich and close by, skip the chain competition and come support this local business!"}
{"text":"This is a local lunch spot for me and I enjoy it every time. The sandwiches are always great and the bread is super fresh. I think the staff could be a bit more friendly and the macaroni salad is a bit bland, so I've opted for chips instead."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch when visiting home one weekend and opted to try their weekend special, The Club. The combo comes with a fat 6-8\" sub, a side, and a drink for ~$7. Not a bad deal! The sandwich was pretty good considering the price, as was the side. The three girls manning the shop were pleasant, but I felt it was a little off that I had to begin the interaction by greeting them at the counter when I was the only patron in the place.  Overall, not a bad experience but nothing spectacular either.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Really friendly service. I noticed they have lots of add on items. ..salads..chips... fruit...cold salads.. and all reasonably priced.   Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Tired of Subway, Quiznos, Jersey Mikes and etc...? Look no further because Arizona Sandwich Co is the better alternative. I'm not trying to make it sound like corny infomercial or testimonial but it is true. The menu offers a huge variety ranging from cold cuts to hot sandwiches. The prices are reasonable as well. You no longer have to wait for a particular day of the week to get the sandwich you want.   There's the option of getting either a half or full sandwich. There are daily specials that comes with a drink and the option of either chips or macaroni salad.   The workers are efficient and line usually goes pretty quickly. They're usually slammed during lunch hours. The parking lot is quite small so finding a spot right in front might be difficult."}
{"text":"I work very close and have tried this place many times, each time thinking I'm not going back, but one of the few handy places on university and area.  First complaint they take your order like McDonalds \"hurry up I don't have time for your special requests\". I have food allergies I have to be able to make special requests. The prices how ever are more than McDonalds.  Staff is not very friendly, I realize that they are very busy but always time for smile and to look someone in the Eye.  They don't even seem to talk to each other.  Then 3rd issue, I find something I like and I can eat with out getting sick, they stop serving it or run out by noon.  (Chicken Salad)    This time I tried to order the vegetable sub without the bun, this comes with out cheese is my assumption since it is considered vegetarian.  She said they would make me salad (not what i asked for but ok).  Came with Shredded cheese (had to pick off allergy) Lettuce was nearly full leaves, needed knife to get it bite size. also used romaine, I wanted Ice berg like on a sandwich.    Guess if you can just eat any thing and don't mind that but I know we send lots of visitors to our company over there and none are impressed any more than I am."}
{"text":"They are hands down one of the BEST sandwich spots! I believe it's a family owned business, they're all so nice. I eat there at least once a week for lunch. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Normally I would Arizona Sandwich Co a 5 +++ Star Rating.  But I am downgrading to 3 stars.  I heave been eating here for years and the prices cannot be beat.....until today.  I was SHOCKED that their prices had gone up again (about 50 cents)  They are now charging tax separately and not including it.  A sandwich that cost me $6.00 last January, $6.50 last June now cost me $7.03 and to top it off the avocado on my sandwich was very brown not the vibrant green it usually is.  I guess I will have to start going to Sacks, Jimmy Johns, Earl of Sandwiches etc more often.  Too bad a great thing had to end."}
{"text":"This place is easily 5 stars!  Incredible subs at decent prices.  Good value for your lunch dollar.  I've loved every sub I've purchased.  Friendly staff and great subs.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So helpful and accommodating! I called last min with a catering order and they were able to make it happen and save the day."}
{"text":"The bread is similar to Hawaiian rolls. I opted for the veggie sandwich and my sister-in-law opted for the avocado, turkey cheese. It would have been better if they put a little more meat in her sandwich, but for a $7 meal, not bad at all."}
{"text":"We have been staying at the Motel 6 on 24th St in Phoenix, and there is a location right next door. We ordered sandwiches the first time, and after we paid, we thought it was a little high priced. The sandwiches seemed a little small for what we paid. But we were pleasantly surprised. They looked small, but were so filling.  Today we went in for breakfast and again, not disappointed. I guess we were a bit put off by some things being microwaved, especially when we paid over 20 bucks for 2 croissants and a burrito. The croissants were nice and flaky. Our son enjoyed his burrito.  The only bad thing again is pricing. But I get they use higher quality products then fast food places."}
{"text":"Love this place have been coming for a while. I'm vegetarian now so it's nice that I can still find something. However just came in today and didn't even get acknowledged for a good 5 minutes by any of the workers, and no it was not busy I'm the only one in here. Customer service seems to not matter as much now a days.   Overall I love this place but today's experience definitely left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The Arizona Sandwich Company  Let me start with the cleanliness of this place, the floors need a good cleaning but the overall condition of the place was ok, however, the restrooms were clean. So i give cleanliness 3 of 5 stars. I came here during the lunch hour and saw there was a line of people and the place was jumping.  The place is not designed for large groups and more of a quick place to eat and run with a few friends.  I decided to try the Sparky which is a turkey avocado bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich.  The bread was spectacular and freshly made. The sandwich had plenty of meat and did not disappoint.  It was so good at a very reasonable price, i went back the next day and had another.  I gave the sandwich 4 of 5 stars and the price 5 of 5 stars.  Overall i loved this place and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Well I guess it serves me right getting a breakfast burrito from a \"Sandwich\" shop, but the flyers were all over my workplace but lesson learned...It never looks as good as the picture. Hit up The Burrito Company or Filaberto's for a good breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day while on my lunch from work. I ordered the #8 Sparky which was really tasty and was a great size. It was much bigger then I had expected. I wish they offered kettle chips or a better variety then Lays potato chips. Also, I wish they had some homemade potato salad like a red potato salad with dill. Something more exciting than the plain, old, boring, yellow potato salad that most places carry. So instead of getting a combo I bought just the sandwich, and went across the street to QT to buy a drink and chips, which is fine.  Okay I do have one pet peeve about this place.  I think it's absolutely crazy that they don't answer the phone during the lunch rush. To me, that is really poor service. Don't get me wrong, obviously by my rating I truly like this place, but to say you're not going to answer the phone because of the rush seems almost...lazy. There are PLENTY of places that have lunch rushes, and some bigger than here and they answer the phones. I almost didn't come here because I originally was told about this place from a coworker so I Googled their number and called to find out more specifically where they were located. But instead of speaking with someone I listened to a message that stated no one would answer the phone during this time. It's a good thing I found them because had I not, that alone would make me not want to try them. It's a pretty big inconvenience to customers who have never been or would like to know about the items they carry. I just don't feel a business should ignore their customers just because they're busy.  Even with the above I will still come here because the sandwiches are excellent!!! And this is coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of subs or sandwiches; I think it's because I ate them so much as a kid."}
{"text":"Food is good price and they look good. But if you don't order a drink from them they charge you 25cents for a small water cup. Lol"}
{"text":"I'm a guy. A guy who likes good sandwiches. These are great sandwiches.  So, if you're a guy (or gal) who like sandwiches then you need to check this place out. Soft bread, quality meats piled high, a garlicky \"house dressing\" which really brings it all together = the perfect lunch. Top that with friendly people working and you have a hit. You may be tempted to order more sub than just the \"shorty\" 6 incher but let me assure you that this will put you in the satiation zone and then some.   Now to spread the word, and my own selfish agenda, to keep places like this growing.  ------- Update Feb '13: STILL consistently great food and wonderful service. Considering my ever increasing number of check ins it probably goes without saying that I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"My favorite go to lunch spot. I work down the street and this place is always, consistently good. Lunch combos are bomb, sand which bread is soft and delish, whatever that Italian dressing they use is perfect. I've pretty much had everything and I'm never disappointed. They even heat up the meat for me when I'm pregnant and need a sandwhich fix. I love this place. Yum yum yum. It's a good price for quality food."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop I've ever been to.  I'll start off with the fact that you will never eat at Subway again!  Meat!  SO MUCH MEAT!  The toppings are wonderful.  And the bread.  THE BREAD!  Soft, squishy, and cooked to perfection.  The only problems you have are when you leave: you're full, and your breath will smell like the house dressing for hours.  But it is so worth it.  If you haven't rolled in here, DO IT!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty fast service and always has really good sandwiches. Don't call at lunch rush, they will not take phone orders during that time. The bread really is my amazing, it is just soft and always fresh. BLT has become my favorite pick there, the amount of bacon is perfect."}
{"text":"What a great little place- Fantastic fresh sandwiches that are big enough to share. Usually very crowded at lunch time!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Their sandwiches are the bomb and at an amazing price. For the people who want to special order their food.. Give it a rest. Lettuce on a hot pastrami sandwich? Ew. This is a gastro sub shop. Best in its class. They know what they're doing. Can you special order food from the Costco Pizza Kitchen? Nope. Same thing here. Top quality food at rock bottom pricing. Where's the beef??? Arizona Sandwich Co.!! I just wished they were open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This is the latest location of Arizona Sandwich Co. We went for the first time about a month ago and have been at least once a week since. I have eaten at least 3 different selections and my boyfriend gets the same kind every time (The Italian Bomber) and we've both always gone away full and happy. For about the same cost of a \"meal\" at Subway you can get a delicious sandwich piled high with fresh tasty toppings on their delicious soft bread that they have made special for them. You get your choice or potato salad, chips or grapes with your sandwich, plus your drink which rounds out the meal just right. Their house \"dressing\", some sort of vinaigrette that comes standard on their sandwiches, is just right. Everyone there is always really friendly. TJ is awesome! We'll be back again and again. Ahwatukee, if you let this one slip away...I might just have to move!"}
{"text":"Everything you want for a casual catering. Made an order to pick up a ton of food for a work party. Very affordable, good presentation on the trays, easy to transport, it was made on time. Last but not least it was tasty! I was in and out quick because one of the workers helped me carry it to my car, without me even asking. Next time I'll dine in and see if I can give a 5th star. :-)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the customer service is terrible. The young woman they put up front has an attitude and it's not something anyone wants to deal with when going to pick up food. They should seriously replace her."}
{"text":"REVISION2/22/2018: I've been back to this place several times. Everytime I come here the guys are friendly and fast. The food is awesome the place is clean.  I loved the sandwich I got here. But my visit there was, well... First of all, I called their business number, five times and received a message that says they were busy. I figured it was just after lunch so maybe they were still busy...(which I'm usually good with, because it means my order will be made fresh)So I decided to actually go there and get take out. When I arrive there's no one there, besides four workers. An older couple walked in after I did. Three customers in the store, that's all. As soon as I walked in to the store the clerk says \"Just to let you know, I'm out of bread.\" Before he even greeted me. Not a good thing for a sandwich shop. They just had a huge order that cleaned them out of bread. Great. He said he could make wraps or he had one more croissant left he could use instead of bread. I opted to get my sandwich on the last croissant. The older couple walked out since they couldn't get what they came for. After I ordered I thought I'd ask him why he couldn't run to the other location to get some bread. He said they were too busy. Bahaha! The irony almost killed me. There were three guys in the back plus the counter guy I was speaking to, no customers and they had no bread. They couldn't be too busy if they had nothing to make their food with and no customers to make it for! Oh the irony!  Anyways I got my sandwich, made on a croissant (which he so graciously said \"I won't up charge for the croissant\"...Why thank you sir, you're so kind) and my drink and potato salad. And went back to work.  As I said the sandwich I ordered was actually very good. I just had to share my (mixed) review  PS. I also mentioned that I called several times and the voice message said the line was busy. He said the phone hasn't rang at all recently, and checked for a dial tone. So if you want for from here just know you'll probably have to actually go TO the store, and be prepared to not get what you actually went there for."}
{"text":"Not a big sandwich gal, but I loooove this place. Their sandwichs are nothing extravagant, but they are goood! Potato salad...on point. Meatball sub to die for. Little place, big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Ever since I saw their menu on my door, I have been dying to try this place. I went today and stuck with the basics: turkey and cheese, lays potato chips and a cherry Coke. First bite: the bread was nice and soft and the turkey was thin and lovely. Great lunch for 6.50 and I will definitelt return to try the pastrami."}
{"text":"Food is really good.  Sandwich's are tasty...and very generous portions........  BUT... the owner has ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE what real customer service actually  means.  Why do I say this?  Here's why:  1) Asked for a 'cold' sandwich to be 'hot'.  OWNER RESPONSE: \"NO!  I cant mix cold and hot sandwich work areas or the Health Department will write me up.\"  WTF??  SUBWAY, Jimmy John's, and every other sub shop has 'hot' and 'cold' in the same area.  Fairly confident you can microwave a 'cold' sandwich without getting written up, no?  2) Asked for a small sample of the chili. OWNER RESPONSE: \"NO. It's beans and some onions and regular chili'  WTF?  Do you understand that if I like the taste, I may actually ORDER some???  I am sure the less than 10 cent food cost for a tiny sample is worth potentially selling several orders as I am a repeat customer for over 2 YEARS!!!!  The staff is great, but the owner needs to get a clue."}
{"text":"Came across this gem on a Yelp search and really glad I did. I can't wait to go back again and try something else the Phoenix rocks!"}
{"text":"Okay this was my first time here and I wasn't disappointed. Very clean place including their restrooms, which is a plus in my book. The Phoenix sandwich was great; can't wait to come back and try the AZ Philly."}
{"text":"I was a regular at the Tempe location, however my office moved to chandler so now whenever I feel like driving far I come here cause I love their sandwiches or I did. They have cut the sandwich down in size and flavor. I got the Philly today, I usually do and it wasn't as juicy as it usually is. It was dry meat and bread. There bread was soft still but tasted sweeter. I think they need to go back to old ways pile the meat high and lots of dressing on the British. I understand if u raise the prices a little but not raise them and shorten the sandwich. The Mac salad was to die for though."}
{"text":"My all time favorite sandwich shop in Arizona!! All the sandwiches I've ever gotten have not lacked in meat and sauce -without being too saucey- Seriously bomb!! I highly recommend the Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"A co-worker introduced me to this nice little sandwich shop a few months ago.  I have been back several times since.  It's close to my work and the service is fast and friendly!  Every time I have been in it is the same dark haired women at the counter taking orders and it's just her.  She welcomes you with a smile and takes your order.  She has a small set up with a phone and a laptop and does triple duty.  They have a daily special usually a half sandwich and soup or salad combo with a drink and it's resonably priced.  You can get a decent lunch for under $10.  On a recent visit I had a 1/2 turkey sandwich and a cup of chicken chili.  The sandwich was fresh and the bread was soft and absorbed some of the condiments well.  I thought the flavor of the chili was nice with just a tiny bit of heat.  On another occasion I got a sandwich, chips and a drink for under $9. Nice!!    This is a small, cozy place.  There are several tables available but if you get there while they are super busy you might not get a table.  I've noticed they do a lot of to go business too.  No tables outside but if you work in that area, there are plently of grassy spots for a little picnic.  You can call in your order for pick up too.  Thanks Arizona Sandwich Company!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Actually, closer to 2.5 stars, but rated as 3 for the small extra boost for the side of macaroni salad which outshone the sandwich that I had.  Whenever I try a new sandwich joint, my first order is always, always their version of a grinder or Italian sub.  Gives me a good gauge as to the quantity and quality of a few different types of meat, and also insight how they dress an Italian sub.  Pepperoncinis, too much/too little Italian dressing, etc.  This sub fell short.  The bread is softer than I like sub bread to be, but that's more a matter of personal taste I guess.  What disappointed me was the ratio of meat.  The best Italian subs are hefty and salty from the different salumi they put in there, and some ham for added volume.  This one consisted of one thin layer of salami and pepperoni, and an overwhelming amount of ham.  The ham itself was oddly, almost fluffy.  The texture was not right, either given the way they slice it our pile it into the sandwich.  Not nearly enough pickle or dressing or spice from the pepperoncini.  I love to support local business, but I can't support this particular sandwich.  With so many other sandwich places out there, I don't think I'll be returning to this one.  Though heir conceptualization of an Italian sub was poor, nothing tasted particularly bad.  And like I said, the macaroni salad was actually quite good.  So 2.5 stars, for value, but a miss on this sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have never been charged to put cheese on the side.   Yes that's right...  ...25¢ to take what they would have put on sandwich and to put in a bag.  Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for me. Close to my office, friendly workers, the soda tap is set to tasty and they sell Otis Spunkmeyer Chocolate Chip cookies... I'm there about twice a week!"}
{"text":"Possibly my new favorite sandwich shop.  There's lots of choices; awesome sandwiches, ice cream, sides (macaroni salads, small salads, pasta) to go with your sandwich(s) etc. plus their prices are pretty fair. Their combo comes with a side, sandwich of the day, and a drink for $7 - way better than most sandwich shop prices. it's a bit on the smaller side, I don't think more than 10-15 people would fit in the store, Lol - and the chairs/seating area could use better placement."}
{"text":"Secent sandwiches.  I had a hot pastrami with mustard and jalapeños.  Friend had a good meatball sandwich.  Potato salad is ok.  I like their soda machine where you can access like 100 different soda flavors.  If youre close and hungry it seems to be an edible lunch.  I dont think i eoukd come here as a destination though."}
{"text":"I've been here three to four times now and have gotten the Italian Bomber, Sparky, and Phoenix.  Haven't had a chance to try any hot sandwiches yet, but these cold sandwiches were great!  Service was friendly and very quick.  The sandwich - loaded with lots of deli meat, the bread (wheat and white) is nice and soft, and the house dressing they put on them is the perfect touch to top it off.  A \"shorty\" sub (half footer) is more than enough food for most people and comes in at around $5-$6.  Great price for a sandwich with much more substance and character than a $5 footlong.  Go try one now!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just started going here on a regular basis the past few weeks after not knowing about it since we moved here and we really like it. It's hard to find local sandwich shops around here but this happens to be a good one even though they do have a few other locations. Very reasonable pricing as well always comes to about $8 for a sandwich side and a drink and it's the perfect amount of food staff is always friendly as well only reason not 5 stars is they are definitely a little stingy on the meat I find myself always throwing away a descent amount of bread every sandwich I get because there's not enough meat also it would be nice if they had another cheese besides provolone I for one don't like provolone and it's the only cheese they have which I find weird for a deli but overall great place"}
{"text":"The bread was big and soft. Yum. Missing something in the veggie filling though ... needed more sauce or cheese or something for taste. If I go again, perhaps I'll ask for mayo or something zestier instead of the oil they have and add more cheese. I couldn't even taste or see any cheese. :(. The workers were nice. More seating would be great. As a recent convert to vegetarianism,  and perhaps thereby a lover of cheese,  I think I'll stick to Subway and Jimmy Johns. Wish I could take AZ Sandwich Co's bread with me to subway and get an egg sandwich or all of the lovely veggie choices Subway has on it. Drool."}
{"text":"Conveniently located by the airport, this quiet little sub shop stands out among the others of its genre in a few ways:  The menu has more than just subs, and everything appears to be made on site.   For instance, the potato salad instead of chips was a nice touch.  I tried the weekend sub, and the other reviewers got it right when they advise trying the house dressing.  The service was professional and polite, and the location was clean.   I'd go back, cheers!"}
{"text":"#23 The Acapulco = albacore tuna, avocado, & jalapenos. Love it! They do not skimp at all on goodies or the tuna. I am very full after eating the 6\" shorty."}
{"text":"Very tasty,  I got the Sparky.  Good sized sandwich with the combo meal.  Their service was surprisingly fast for a lunch rush.   I was in town for business and was looking for somewhere simple, local, and not a chain.   This place delivered.   It was a little hard to find, it is in a business plaza that seems to be doing some remodeling."}
{"text":"I come to the Arizona Sandwich company everyday for their sandwich combo for lunch. Everything is amazing, from the quality of the food to the customer service. I really enjoy the #4 Turkey and Avocado. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"When working in Tempe this hoagie this Philly girl was closest to home I've had here.  It's the bread just amazing.  Have not been there in a bit but gonna have hubby bring us a tray lol. It's football time! Makes me think of home."}
{"text":"I really love this place, and it would have earned 5 stars if they had better hours. It seems that every time I have a real craving for one of their sandwiches, they're closed.   I like the party platter the best, and when we go out on the boat I like to get one for the trip."}
{"text":"Ok, I work down the street and have seen the Line at this place and its UNREAL, ALWAYS been busy,, so I had a late lunch one day and the line wasnt bad,, Stopped in and got 2 samiches,, the Sky Harbor and the AZ Philly,,   The price was great and so was the SUbs... this is a CAN DO place,,,  Parking can be a BIA, so be warned,, Will add to a once a month rotation.."}
{"text":"Go here for lunch quite often and I've never had a bad meal. I have tried various soups and sandwiches and only disappointed in their clam chowder. It had a fishy taste. Their pastrami is awesome, as well as the sausage and kale soup. They are always quick even when the line is out the door. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Prices are cheap-- and quality is high.  They load each sandwich with tons of meat and I love their special herb mix.  The staff is really nice and always good about remembering the names of their regulars :)   I find myself eating here several times a week!"}
{"text":"From out of town and was looking for an alternative for Subway as it is not my favorite, should have gone to Subway. The store was dark and drab, the girl who took my order wanted to be anywhere but there and told me their turkey wrap didn't come with onions. After a few confusing minutes, she got that I wanted to build my own wrap. The lettuce was watery and the tortilla was dry and cracked all over.  Do not know if it was a bad night but won't go back while I'm here."}
{"text":"This is totally a hole in the wall sandwich shop that I found quite delicious. The only real reason I didn't give it five stars was the few sandwich choices. However that could be their key to creating delicious sandwiches.  I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich with all the trimmings it's originally offered in. It tasted as if the chicken salad was created right there and then, not sitting around. Most likely it was, because come on they have to make a profit somehow.  The Potato Salad wasn't overwhelming with dill or tarragon. It was better than what I was expecting, because be real we all like our mothers and compare others to that standard.  This place also shares the same suite with a kickass ice cream shop. Definitely you should leave some room for it.  I will return."}
{"text":"So good, if you go within the last two hours of them closing they will most likely be out of the white bread. Even if you think it is a simple sandwich they put some delicious voodoo :) in the Sparky"}
{"text":"Two issues:  1. your website says to call for the daily soup but when you call your machine says you don't accept phone calls until after 2PM. Which forces me to either drive over in person to find out the soup or pass and go someplace else. I go someplace else. I am a vegetarian and you don't always offer a vegetarian soup option so I don't want to take that chance.  2. you don't offer a vinegar only option on your subs. only oil and vinegar. this makes the sandwich either way too oily or tasteless without it."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great prices, and hefty portions.  Myself and two other co-workers got sandwiches from here and could all only eat half of the foot-long sandwiches we got because they had so much meat."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at AZ sandwich company in years and I had a reminder why after my last visit.  I had grown tired of the sub par subs at the Subways of the world but was limited on time for my lunch hour and decided to give AZ Sandwich Co a try.  It wasn't my jam.  I respect their \"weight\" style of thinking when it comes to the toppings of the sub but the bacon portion of my my club was not helping the weight part of their philosophy.  The ham had an odd sweet taste to it and was very fatty.  The value of the sandwich was there but it didn't suit my tastes.  A good place for a cheap and filling meal."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sandwich shops in town. Clean, friendly, and the sandwiches are always packed high with fresh ingredients. Try the All American for $5"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here. Great sandwiches, burritos and salads. The sandwiches and burritos are packed with meats and really quite filling. Food tastes good and fresh !"}
{"text":"Not too bad... good subs, kinda small though. 5 inches?  A+ Meatball sub tho, well done!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but my experience at this spot was worth me taking my time to type something up. The owner, TJ, is super friendly and helpful. He takes customer service to the next level. Did I like the sandwich? Indeed I did! The bread is soft and fresh. The meat is sliced deli thin and packed on thick. The 'secret sauce' adds a nice twist to it too.   I drive past this place every single day, it's literally around the corner and up the street from my house. I was coming home from the eye doctor who used some eye drops that made my vision really blurry. I decided to finally stop in since it's close to home (I was afraid to drive farther).   TJ was behind the register and he immediately greeted me with a smile. My vision was blurry, not blind... I could see his teeth, so I think it was a smile :) plus the energy in his voice was welcoming. I told him I couldn't see anything on the menu but that I wanted something with turkey. He described all my options and when I told him I had to keep my calorie count low (non work out day), he suggested the healthiest option. Then just my luck, I had issues with my debit card ... I was so embarrassed. But TJ assured me not to worry and it was his treat.   I returned again today to pay my debt and try a different sandwich. TJ was at the counter again.... I overheard him call his customers by name. Then he made an effort to remember my name, which I totally like. Yeah, say my name! ... 'cause sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your name :-)  I know it's just a sandwich, but it's fresh meat, fresh bread, fresh veggies, and great customer service. It's way better than going to Subway (which to me stinks like someone's crusty feet). And I'm one to support local mom and pop shops rather than chain stores. They are always much more welcoming than the random employee at a big name shop.   So yes, Arizona Sandwich Company has a new fan. I'll be coming here again and again... especially after my long runs... I'll be looking for all that meat they pack ;-)"}
{"text":"I had the $7.99 daily special. It was a pastrami, chips, and a drink. Pretty solid sandwich. Good portion, good price, clean, and with the exception of fast food it's about the only game in the area. Service was friendly too. I'll return for another for sure."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sandwich place in phoenix! The service is great and the sandwiches are even better! Price is inexpensive as well! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Will never go back! The service was awful & the sandwiches are sloppy, ugly, poor quality messes. Only 1 vegetarian option, old/soggy toppings. Told the counter girl I had not been there before.  She gave no useful information. Told her I am a vegetarian. She made some condescending remark (possible joke but not funny.) Told her TWICE what I did not want on the sandwich, the cook in the window heard me & they still got it wrong. DO NOT go there."}
{"text":"I really like AZ Sandwich Co because they make sandwiches and salads with integrity. it makes me feel good to know that someone cared/was prideful enough to make my sandwich delicious. Good people. Good foods."}
{"text":"Longer wait, but really great breakfast burritos. Bacon, egg, potato and cheese was very good.   Looking forward to trying more from the lunch menu. And even the catering for work.   Fresh carrot cake delivered in was the best part. We finished it before our food even came out."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches - long long but it moved fast! Good prices for what you get. I saw some reviews about no substitutions but I had no troubles asking for extras or to remove things.  Will come back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"I just went to AZ Sandwich today.  It is hard to find this location and it almost looks like you are going to a bad alley. The location is in Tempe, so I knew it would be safe.  I got a turkey club with avocado.  It was absolutely amazing and it came with a garlic vinegar sauce.  I opted to get the sauce on the side because my friend told me they have a tendency to drench the sauces on the sandwich.  I used the sauce almost like a French dip sauce.  The sandwiches here are called \"smallies.\" but they are actually quite a good size.  I actually got a combo thinking the size was too small, and I barely ate any of my chips.  Overall, I am very happy with the freshness of the ingredients, and I feel like I got my bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"So, I went here for lunch.  Paid extra to have the large sub combo so I would have leftovers for dinner.  Didn't happen.  I ordered the BLT meal, paid extra to have the larger sub, cost about 9 and a half bucks.  OK if I can make two meals out of it, which was my plan.  This did not happen.  Not too impressed.  Now the bread, 5 stars on that.  Thick and soft, good flavor.  Sadly, that is where the compliments end.  There was three pieces of bacon on the sub.  Three.  9 and a half dollars.  Three pieces of bacon.  9 and a half bucks.  (I am trying to prove a point here)  I am not happy.  It was basically a lettuce sub.  Everyone else I went to lunch with had more meat in their sub than Ron Jeremy has in his pants.  Not mine.  I threw away the second half of my lettuce sub because, well it was a lettuce sub.  The staff was friendly and service was quick.  Sadly, does not make up for screwing me out of the bacon content of my sub.  The slices of bacon that were evident were small, like the ones you get on a 99 cent menu fast food burger.    I was told to try something else by my friends if I go back there.  I don't think they will get the chance.  Bacon up the BLT.  Until then... Pass."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch. Staff is friendly and they always get the order right. They also have a stamp card which is an incentive for a free meal! One of my favorite tempe spots"}
