{"text":"This is my favorite place to get takeout from! 

They do a red dinner that comes with potatoes that's phenomenal! 

Pepperoni rolls are rad! 

Then there Chicago style pizza is the best thing in the world! Comes with ricotta cheese on it!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious pizza is the best around in my opinion. sauce is homemade lots of creative pizzas to offer, owner is amazing catering is too delicious to be so cheap."}
{"text":"Their pizza is DISGUSTING! I mean that in the nicest way. It's the sauce I believe. It reminds me of ChefBoyRD sauce in my spaghettiOs. It was so gross I'm writing this review while the pizza is still being consumed by my disappointed children. The delivery was timely and the order taker was very polite. I just can't imagine what the hype is about."}
{"text":"I was more than pleased with Joe and crew ! I had my wedding reception at a new winery, Kosicek's. Joe from Mama Primozz was very accommodating. Everyone raved about the food! I would definitely recommend them for any occasion!"}
{"text":"We came from out of town to visit family and needed a good delivery place with better than average food. We were pleasantly surprised that the food was reallllllly good! Spaghetti and delicious meatballs that came with a hearty salad and a generous piece of garlic toast; and all for a reasonable price. Noodles cooked perfectly. Sauce was tasty. I would absolutely recommend them and most certainly try them again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"This place has the best best best pepperoni and cheese roll. It comes with a cup of delicious sauce. A friend 20 years ago ordered a couple of rolls for us for lunch and I tried it. I ha e been addicted to these rolls ever since. I actually look forward to heading into Lake county for a visit just so I can grab one of these rolls. It is absolutely the best thing on the menu. The pizza is average but I think the white pizza is a little above average. They have a garlic butter that is homemade that you can purchase in a cup and it is great with the pizza with real garlic in the cup. They deliver but they have a minimum and since he rolls are cheap you would need to order five to get to the delivery minimum. One roll can fill a grown man so what does that tell you about the servings! I will be back next month for a wedding and I will be hitting this place hard!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with this place I'm glad they delivered. I ordered spaghetti Alfredo because they do not carry fettuccine and a large side of garlic bread which is two pieces. The lady on the phone could not figure out how to enter my order and was trying to convince me to get the Alfredo meal that comes with a side salad and a piece of garlic bread. I told her I did not want the side salad so she said I could get an extra piece of garlic bread instead of the side salad I agreed. I also ordered a piece of cheesecake. And I used my credit card over the phone to pay. They arrived quicker than I expected to my house. The woman that brought me my food look like she was also the one that prepared it. She told me that she did not realize I was paying with a credit card over the phone and didn't have the correct paper for me to sign and I was to just sign a piece of paper she had which I didn't like. When I opened the packaging I realized that they gave me a side salad and only one piece of garlic bread when I had expected two pieces and a separate order of two more pieces. The spaghetti alfredo looks like dry noodles with a little milk stirred into them and that's exactly what it tasted like. The cheesecake was a prepackaged little thing you can buy in a store. Not the homemade one I was expecting. I was not very happy with this order"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good pizza place in Eastlake and I finally found it! The pizza was wonderful! I also got their spinach salad with hot bacon dressing. I am German so I have had some good hot bacon dressing, theirs was sensational! I would definitely recommend it. They do catering, delivery and carry out-only."}
{"text":"Started off great.  Took coupon no problem and the girl on phone was super nice and fun.  When we got there the food was ready.  Bonus.  The chick overcharged me, refunded the money and re-rung me....essentially freezing the money from initial transaction for a few days.  No biggie except, at that point in time, lunch cost me 30 bux until the funds went back.  The alfredo pasta was good.  The spaghetti and red sauce one I had has as well had no flavor and the \"meatball\" they charged me 90 cents extra for looked like burnt marble.  Or a dingleberry off a St. Bernards bum...  Maybe I just came on a bad day but there are LITERALLY 20 places like this in the Willowick, Greaselake, Wickliffe, Peuclid area...cookie-cutter Italian.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classy pizza place to have a sit down dinner, Mama Primozz isn't that kind of place. (It was at one point, but they took out the dining room years ago.) Some might even call it a hole-in-the-wall, but that doesn't bother me. The pizza is just SO good. My favorite is the garden pizza - one of their specialty items. It's a white pizza with spinach, tomatoes, and Italian dressing. It oozes with oil - and with flavor. The garlic bread is phenomenal and the dinner salads are a good size and have lots of cheese. I'm also a fan of their white pizza. The spices are just right in the sauce, if you can call it that. I don't live anywhere near Mama Primozz anymore and still make a pilgrimage a few times a year.  if you ever end up in Eastlake, feel free to give this little place a shot."}
{"text":"This family-run takeout on Vine St. Doesn't disappoint! They do a pan style pizza with a great crust and a unique, sweeter sauce that is a nice departure from the norm. Their prices are very competitive and they didn't even charge me for extra sauce. I appreciate how polite and friendly the staff are and the pizza chef mural in the entryway is very cool."}
{"text":"This place definitely has its good and bad point. When you call, the lady who always seems to answer (I call her Mama), she is always short and rude. I will say what keeps me coming back is the food is great!"}
{"text":"ate this stuff in 2006 when my daily meals were banquet tv dinners. i remember enjoying it at the time but since i make my own pizza from scratch now and my tastes and standards have changed and the first review on google is bad i bet it would be mediocre now."}
{"text":"We watched the Snoozerbowl at my mom's in Willowick. She has a big stupid tv. The in laws invited themselves over, but we didn't warn her ahead of time. She would have made a nine course feast. They did, however order a za at halftime. My first thought was, good luck- you'll be eating by midnight. Then I realized this was Eastlake and that no one has any money for food, so takeout probably wouldn't be that swamped. They returned with two \"larges\" the size of personal pan pizzas. But the dough and cheese are as dense as a Browns fan's skull. So they were almost like deep dish-ish. One, the white sauced garden pie was amazing. The other was a Hawaiian. Not the best Hawaiian I've ever had, but still decent. They have tons of oddball sides(cabbage and noodles!) available as well. Drove by the joint my whole life, and like a lot of my reviews lately, finally tried it. Pleasant surprise during the dullest game I've seen since preseason. The food was so tasty, even Bruno Mars couldn't ruin my night."}
