{"text":"The decor is nice, however, the place is freezing cold and the service is extremely slow! I have ordered a table for 10 people and it took them over two hours to serve us our order, we were tired of waiting and decided to cancel the order as it took way to long. The waitress was extremely rude, she was arguing with us as to the quality of the food and the time it takes to prepare it. Also, a lot of the dishes were not avaiblse and we were advised about that after 10 minutes from the time of the order. The waitress had no clue on what the dishes were and what was going on in the kitchen. In addition, the table besides us was getting food nonstop. I was never treated so bad in a restaurant. Very disappointed!! Will not recommend it at all!!!!!"}

This small restaurant is the place where you can find standard Georgian fares and good wine at a modest rates."}
{"text":"When we noticed that a new Georgian restaurant opened in our neighborhood, we immediately decided to go there with my parents - my father loves Georgian cuisine. 
I have mixed impression about our visit, may be we just had high expectations... Let's start with the service, it was friendly but a bit disorganized. For example, our dish was sent to some other table and nobody even noticed this until my husband complained. The ambiance and decorations are quite nice, not sure though how I feel about black bear taxidermy... As for the food, it was a hit and miss. We liked appetizers: baked mushrooms and eggplant rolls with walnut were really good, satsivy was ok. We weren't that happy with the main dish, lamb shish kebab was very chewy, lobio was plain and tasteless, the only dish that we liked was chicken in harcho sauce. We will try to visit this place in a couple of months, hopefully the owners will pay attention to patrons' feedback and things will improve."}
