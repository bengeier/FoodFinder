{"text":"Before the review I would like to note: I go here literally 3 times a week.  Review:  Past 6-7 months I have been coming to Petra shawarma for my middle eastern fix. Why? No idea. I have never had the same food so much this frequently.  The previous business went by the name of \"sultan.\" I went there once or twice but really did not like this food at all. just bland, generic, ali baba type shawarma which was boring. Then came Petra.  The owner, is a young guy from Jordan and unlike most of his competitors he literally makes every thing from scratch. Yes the meat included, most stores import this meat frozen fyi.   The ingredients are imported from Jordan which I think is the reason why the food is so succulent. Most of the time shawarma requires tahini sauce, hot sauce, etc. As a fitness enthusiast i often omit high sodium sauces thus no tahini. However, his meat has SO much flavour its really amazing. Like I literally never put any additional sauces.   The hours are short but its worth IT. 11:45 ish to whenever the meat finishes, which typically would be 5-6ish. Makes you wonder why other stores stay open till 1am? Guess their meat isn't finishing.   The reason I am going so hard for this place is simply because its literally the best shawarma in the city. No one would know it given the location but I would bet all my money on that statement. The owner is humble guy who is the sole runner for the store and he does a great job at it. Real inspiring to see a young guy with such enthusiasm and passion.  But yeah, great fresh food, no complaints and will continue being a frequent customer.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Fresh, Healthy Food, at a great price. $7.99 for a Chicken Shawarma Combo.  The only downfall is the man serving you does not care what you do, or dont like on your shawarma. He asks if you like it spicy, but otherwise he does not care to give you ANY time to choose your toppings. If you dont know what it is.. it seems its too bad for you when you are here, which is a shame, and a complete waste of food. I have a very sensitive stomach, and spent half of my time picking out things i did not want in my shawarma, like pickled cabbage, heavily peppered onions, bean salad, and .. pasta salad? All of which i did not want, but he did not give me any choices.  Same with my sode salad.  No choice.  Everything thrown on it.  He throws everything together SUPER FAST before you can get a single word out. I also ordered the rice which he said is not spicy... but, it is.. apparently, if he likes it.. you should too. Wasted my money because I could not eat it, neither could my kids.  Disappointing in this aspect really. Otherwise, this place would be great. However, this is the 2nd time I have been here, and for those reasons I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has some really good points, but unfortunately it was let down by too many bad points.  The good: 1. The guy preparing the food was very nice. 2. The vegetables were all fresh and tasty and a good variety. 3. The sauces were pretty good (although the hot sauce wasn't very hot). 4. Prices were very reasonable. 5. The meat was freshly cut off the spit and very tender.  The bad: 1. The girl at the cashier was just miserable. Very unpleasant. 2. While the meat was fresh and tender, it was severely lacking in seasoning. Even the salt was missing. Ugh. Salt is a necessity. If I had a bit with one of the pickles and the meat, it was fine. But if I had a bite with meat on its own, I could really taste how bland the chicken was. No bueno. 3. The guy pressed the pita against the side of the spit (intentionally) and it ended up with this heavily smoky flavour on the wrap (like burned gas). Some people might like that; I did not. It was very strong and distracting flavour. 4. My wrap was broken apart even before I started eating it. Every other wrap that he prepared before mine was breaking apart. Learn to wrap better or maybe get different pitas.   I just don't think I'll come back for bland meat, falling apart wraps, and miserable cashiers."}
{"text":"Came twice during their business hours and they are closed. Waste of time. No notice nothing MG saying they are closed."}
{"text":"It was a cold day.  The owner immediately gave us a hot lentil soup as we entered.  It was delicious.  We ordered the chicken shwarma.  The rice was very flavorful and the chicken was delicious.  He also had a great variety of salads.  The one little problem I did see was that he was using the same gloves/hands to serve chicken and salads.  I don't mind it but a vegetarian would have a big issue.   Over all excellent food."}
{"text":"This place went through 3 ownership changes in the past 2 years. The current owner is great. Delicious food, friendly service, good price, tons of fresh vegetables for no additional charge (and I'm a meat lover). Hope this place stays around this time."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  We come here at least weekly for the most flavorful and exotic mix of tastes imaginable.  The gentleman who serves us is so friendly with exceptional service provided. Goes above and beyond any expectations for service.  Takes the time, however busy, to interact with my daughter and always makes sure she leaves with gum! Very warm and home-made flavor.  Fresh ingredients in great, balanced portion. Yum!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this was a good shawarma!! I wanted to add a picture but I ate my plate so fast!! Yum. I love the daily deals too, 2 shawarmas for $10 taxes in on Monday and Wednesday! Can't beat that.  And the service from Ahmed was top class. He cuts fresh off the roaster and plates generously!   This place is our new favorite in the area!"}
