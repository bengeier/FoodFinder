{"text":"Food is incredibly delicious. This is hands down the tastiest kosher pizza in all of Toronto. The waiter, who has been there for 20+ years, Dixon, is incredibly courteous and awesome. The place is really really nice, a perfect spot to go for tea or lunch or breakfast with a friend or relative or business associate. The only thing is the waiting time, it takes a WHILE to get your food. I think because a lot of their food they make fresh for you, so it's worth it. But wow their prices are high. I got a breakfast for 2... $35! Wow. I love the place, but you have to have money to eat there. I don't but I still go when I can."}
