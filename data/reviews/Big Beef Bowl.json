{"text":"I've been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant, and they did not disappoint. We ordered their classic noodles, braised beef noodles, and the one with pickled vegetable and mushroom noodles. The noodles were so fresh and so good, I could not stop eating it. Out of the three, I liked the pickled vegetable the most. We also ordered the potato salad (I always love to eat this), cabbage and fungus appetizers.   They were so nice and the service was excellent! They offered us more soup to go with the remaining noodles when they noticed we were low. We will definitely come back to try other things on the menu! So happy they opened in the area"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 4.5/5  Food: Not many options on the menu, but I love it! Four choices of noodles and a variety of appetizers to share. You choose the soup base and you get six different options of noodles: round or flat and each comes in thin, regular or large .  Braised beef noodle: with regular round noodles - that's my go to. I find the thicker noodles don't soak in the broth as much. I always add in a good amount of the chilli oil that they have readily available at the table. If you can take spicy, I highly recommend it. The beef is always tender as well.   Atmosphere: Small place with very few tables. The restaurant probably seats 18 total? It's not a place where you can sit and chat for awhile with your company, having said that, it means the turnover rate is pretty quick. During peak times, there's almost always a wait... outside. So not great when it's cold out, but so worth it. Sometimes, people wait inside too, which can feel slightly crowded, especially if there's someone unintentionally hovering over you while you eat.  Service: Quick and simple service. Can't complain."}
{"text":"I tried this place around 5pm on a weekday. My fiancé and I were seated instantly. There are not many seats inside, so if you arrive at a busy time, be prepared to wait in line. Each of us ordered the Classic Beef Noodles. It was interesting to watch the chef hand-pulling the noodles in front of us.  My fiancé ordered the Spicy Potato Strips as a side dish and really enjoyed it. He also loved the noodles, saying they reminded him of his childhood in China. Unfortunately, I didn't find the noodles or the broth very flavourful, even after adding a bit of spice. They were just average for me. My fiancé ended up finishing my noodles.  I would come here again to give the BBQ skewers a try but I wouldn't eat the noodles again."}
{"text":"Am I missing something that everybody else is praising?  It's a cute little Bruce Lee endorsed joint of a dozen stools.  My plump Canadian arse overhung the seat, so it wasn't comfortable.  Personally I thought there would be a show of a chef making fresh noodles in front of the patrons.  I guess it's all pre-made in the morning?  I've had freshly pulled noodles (PacMall 2nd floor), this must be a unique recipe.  My udon noodles were served slightly too al dante, I.e. hard, but I didn't complain as I thought this is how it was made and served.  The meat was tender but as somebody else mentioned, the broth lacked depth.  It tasted like a Szechuan hot chilli soup.  My wife ordered the regular flat noodle.  The noodles appeared to be the flat egg lo mein bought at the supermarket, but she said it was good, but slightly past al dente.  She didn't like the soup base, even though she asked for no cilantro (absolutely hates this herb), but it still had the essence of it.    Saving grace was their dumplings, they look store bought, but I've eaten enough frozen dumplings to know that these tasted a lot better.    The staff is plentiful and friendly.  Go early otherwise all the seats get taken."}
{"text":"Do you like brisket? Then this is where you should come for the most delectable, well cooked beef brisket noodle dish. Go for the hand pulled flat noodles and spice it up!"}
{"text":"Last time I went to Big Beef Bowl, that guy forgot wash his hand before pull the noodle. And I found there is a human's hair in the noodle. So disgusting. Magic noodle taste better than this one.."}
{"text":"The handpulled Lanzhou noodles (made to order) were plentiful with different sizes and shapes to choose from. If you like your noodles al dente (chewy) like I do, go with the medium or think noodles. Their handmade dumplings are also tasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here almost since they first opened. The owner is super nice, and the staff is always friendly. But most importantly the food is terrific. I usually get the braised beef, and it tastes great. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre and forgettable. Would not return. Food was rather bland overall.   Food was a 3 and service was a 2 - ended up giving a 2 because others eating with us had dishes they rated a 2.   We ordered the beef brisket with round thick noodles, ground meat  noodle, eggplant appetizer, pork and chive dumplings, mushroom and cucumber salad, potato appetizer.   The noodles themselves were ok but not as chewy as I would like for hand pulled noodles. The brisket was very flavourful but the broth was just moderately flavoured. The ground meat noodles were bland. The eggplant was garlicky and tasty, the filling for the dumplings was juicy and tasted good but the wrapper was a bit too chewy and thick. Mushroom and cucumber salad lacked flavour and potato appetizer was alright.   The restaurant is quite small but the waitresses missed some of our order and were not easy to get a hold of when we needed water or tea."}
{"text":"The food was decent, the grilled mushrooms in particular was great though!   However we had a major problem with the waitress/cashier there. We were a party of 3 and they gave a 4 person seating to a party of 2 when another party of 2 was already paying. We had already waited outside in the cold for 20 mins for the seats. They not only did NOTHING to rectify the situation, they made us wait longer as \"punishment\" and the cashier / waitress even had the nerve of yelling at my mom? That's very disrespectful and unprofessional.  I understand that your work is stressful and difficult, but that's 100% unacceptable behaviour.  The girl also chose to not let me tip for the meal, despite my intention to leave 7% for the kitchen staff. Unfair call on her part, and I feel sorry for the guys who have to work with her on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Delicious cheap eats! This little hole in the wall seats about 15 people but it's worth being squished. Serving time was fast. The Braised Beef is delicious! Vinegar and chili oil are on the tables if you want to add more flavour. The menu is small with about 4 main dishes, 6 noodle options and a few appetizers. Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've come back numerous times and the quality has come back up.  Fresh noodles, great soup, fast service.  Just be weary that the dining space is really small and if you come during peak hours, seating is difficult to get."}
{"text":"This is the number 1 place in north York that I will choose to eat noodle!! The stewed beef noodle is my favourite! Also the cheese corn is great!"}
{"text":"On an extremely cold day, this is the food you are willing to walk for. Surprisingly, they only had 2 people when we arrived around 6pm on a Saturday. It got busy pretty quick after us so I guess we just lucked out.   I ordered a large Braised Beef Brisket and let me say, it was Large AF...For the noodles, I chose the round regular since I hate flat noodles. The taste of the broth was okay, nothing amazing but still very hearty and warming. Enough to put a smile on my face especially on these cold Toronto nights. I just wish it was alot more spicy, I had asked for them to add spice but the girl said it's already spicy. A bit disappointed there but that's okay. The beef however, was fantastic. Tender and so soft, melt in your mouth....*drool*... Finally, the noodles...they were good but not the best noodles I've ever had. Nothing to go crazy about.  Bottomline, for the portion you get, it's definitely worth it to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Checked it out... basically the noodles tasted like rubbery flour and the beef was mediocre at best. $ave your money and eat elsewhere. I left the store with my meal unfinished, as I couldn't stand the atrocious taste."}
{"text":"I came here last week and order a big bowl of beef noodle. Horrible?only like 3 lightly slices meat? and noodle taste is terrible"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Always consistent and delicious.  The staff is just great and welcoming.  I live around the corner and always get take out, all the dishes are great to go.  I've introduced friends to this place and have one who drives from Mississauga because they love this place so much."}
{"text":"Very good food. The hand-pulled noodles are fairly doughy and flavourful. There is no mistaking that they are made fresh.  You have the option of customizing your noodles by choosing thin, regular, or fat, and then deciding upon round or flat noodles.  The menu isn't that extensive but I suppose you only come here for the hand-pulled noodles and those were definitely great!  The broth is also very good and flavourful in a savory manner with good umami. The broth was also very \"clean\" without any oil or fat.   Portion sizes are quite generous with the small size being more than adequate to serve as a meal. But, the large is only $1 more and if you are very hungry, then it's likely more than worth it.   The restaurant itself is quite small so not adequate for large groups (no more than a group of 4 would be able to sit together). Service was what you would expect for a place such as this - not overly friendly but efficient.   I would definitely recommend this place and I will also be returning myself."}
{"text":"Their chilli sauce is second to none. Noodle was fresh and bouncy, broth was flavourable but meat portion was a bit lacking. I don't mind paying a buck more for extra meat. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into the restaurant you'll notice that it is a small eatery similar to the setup of Kinton Ramen but on a smaller scale. The exhaust fan was humming loudly as if you are in a plane and the restaurant barely large enough for the staff and patrons.   Going past the setting my girlfriend and I find the food sub par. We ordered the classic beef and the spicy beef noodle both with egg and broad noodle. To start the broth was too watery. It's not the rich and well seasoned broth I expected it to be. Both my girlfriend agreed that it was a light soup. Not bland but light. Perhaps a little too light. The noodle wasn't too impressive. It almost feels like I am eating dumpling skin as noodle. It was too thick and starchy. Also the egg we got was rather boring. It was simply a fried egg. Nothing fancy. Lastly the quantity of meat you get is disproportionate to the amount of noodle you get. We also ordered the grilled corn, which we find overpoweringly spicy. Essentially too heavy handed with the chili powder. It killed my taste buds afterward rendering everything tasteless.   I am tempted to compare this restaurant to Kinton but I realize that it's completely different. Despite that I can't help but to notice that there is some resemblance with the two. You'll probably feel the same if you have been to both.   I think if I were to sum this up. You are essentially getting might market food in a restaurant setting. It has the novelty factor but certainly doesn't have the culinary quality."}
{"text":"This became my favorite hand-pulled noodle place now. Every time I order the beef brisket noodle, it's amazing! The beef is so soft and flavored. Next time I want to try the original beef noodle soup. By the way, this place opens earlier in the morning than other noodle place around that area. So good choice for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"A very small restaurant, serving Chinese style noodles. Most important thing about this place is that I caught a Jigglypuff behind the air conditioner here (omg she's too adorable).   Friends love the stewed beef topping, whereas I felt it was only OK. Very scarce, too. Ditto the wood ear mushroom side dish, which is served in a small portion about the size of a large soy sauce dish.   Lots of noodle type options, from the skinniest rounds to the thick ribbon style and many in between, you're bound to find one that suits your fancy. My partner found the noodles too \"bouncy\" for his liking, while I thought mine weren't \"bouncy\" enough. Though that's not my biggest *beef* (pun intended). is that the broth is kinda flavourless.   On the plus, I've been told by my partner that the noodles are pretty much the way they should be. Staff is friendly. Oh, and don't forget there's that Jigglypuff."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant that serves authentic hand pulled noodles. There are different noodle thicknesses that you can choose from, and noodles have a great chew to them. Soup broth and meat were very tasty too! Surprisingly great service. Only downside is that there is no parking, and limited seating..but for the quality of the food and price, I think it's well worth it! Highly recommend =)"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago after hearing about it. It may have been a bad day as the noodles where soggy and there was really nothing good about it. Noticed a customer beside me who did not even finish half his bowl and just left. On the other hand, the grilled eggplant was really good. The service was good, and food came out promptly."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place on a Saturday.  Very small place and no ventilation. We ordered lamp skewers - decent taste nothing special  Classic soup with medium flat noodles and brisket soup with medium flat noodles.  The name of the place is deceiving, one would think it's about the beef but the soup had a small strip of beef and tons of noodles off course.  Overall taste of soup was good but the it was more of a noodle soup then the beef bowl."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant and so wants ed to give it a try. It is a very small restaurant with two tables and two bench areas. Ordered a bowl of classic beef noodle and a pork, chives and eggs dumplings.  Classic Beef Noodle I can taste that a variety of spices are used to cook the broth. The broth is kind of on the light side of taste. You are given about six different choices of the type of noodles you want. I picked the round regular type of noodle. To be honest, I find the bowl of noodle  is a bit ordinary.  Dumplings  I can tell the wrapping is homemade. It's a bit of thick but not too bad. Again, it is an ordinary dish.   I was hoping I could find something special since my friend recommended this restaurant. Another  thing is may be I was not ordering spicy dishes and that's why I found everything plain."}
{"text":"My favourite noodle place!  A fresh as it gets and with great flavours that you can't find at other places like their Meat Sauce and Picked Mustard."}
{"text":"Bias beware: I LOVE NOODLES   Yall know CHARLES C the frugal food fanatic. Back at it again with a FFFF (FRUGAL FOOD FUN FACTS).   It's amazing that regional Chinese cuisine is starting to sprawl all over ynf. In a few more years I hope that fellow food lovers will know the difference between sichuan and yunnan (David Chang's wish as well!).   Get yourself a small size for beef noodle soup (brisket) for $8. Unless you're a power lifter you probably won't finish the noodles...if you do then wolf down the delicious clear broth as well.   You could always go full Trevor James and dump the chili oil in too. Never hurts!"}
{"text":"Food was good! The place was super tiny. We were sat in the window but your back is pretty much touching the table seated behind you. The service was great the staff were very nice. You can see them making the noodles. The large is really large I would get the regular size. It was a dollar more so went with it :) the noodles were cooked perfect and the brother had a good flavour. The only thing I didn't like is the potato salad had some oil on it that I know this will sound weird but tasted and smelled like the Muji store...lol I know it sounds weird but it had a taste like the essential oil from the diffuser. I would go back and looking forward to going again. There was easy parking right in front on Byng."}
{"text":"Very tiny place but very authentic Chinese noodle place. I felt as if I was eating in China. The food was great and portions are big. You can add more meat if you are a meat lover."}
{"text":"This is prob my fave Chinese pull noodle place.  I've been to a few other ones and the only reason others get my business is when big beef bowl is closed.  The broth is the best, not too salty and very rich in flavour.  Lots of choice for noodles as well.  It's a small location though so at peak hours you may have to wait for a seat.  They have outdoor tables in the summertime though."}
{"text":"Finally tried this noodle place after walking by so many times. The pork belly skewers were sold out although it was quite early in the evening (6 pm) so we ordered lamb skewers and grilled eggplant. Both were just ok, the lamb was a little bland. Our noodle was good, we liked our broth but there was way too much noodle and not enough beef... The restaurant is quite small so you will hear the fan clearly and loudly. There are better choices for noodle in that area so I guess we won't be back soon."}
{"text":"This is one of the better beef brisket noodle dishes that I've had in Toronto. The price is very reasonable ($8 for a large size which comes with plenty of noodles and a decent amount of meat).   There is a fairly large noodle choice, and I did like the taste and texture of the medium flat ones that I selected. The beef brisket was fairly tasty. I particularly enjoyed the broth... it had just the rice level of spice.  Service  is very friendly. As others have mentioned, its a small cramped place. We were lucky enough to get the table for 4  outside  with no wait.   Walking distance from Finch station. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"My favourite noodle place! I'm a super big fan of Chinese beef noodles and this is my go-to place. My usual order is the braised beef noodle soup. The braised beef is amazingly flavourful and falls apart in your mouth, they're generous in the amount they give you as well. Noodles are hand-pulled and have a great chewy texture, you can choose from 6 different noodle styles/thickness. The broth that goes with the noodles is also amazing too!  Portions are huge here so beware when you order a large! Only downside of the place is how small it is, would not recommend coming here if you have a big group of people."}
{"text":"Such bad service. I ordered a side of chicken wings and I received a side of lamb skewers. Nicely told the server (pale asian with dark brown hair and a mole on her neck) I didn't order this (I don't eat lamb and didn't even know it was a menu item) and she rudely insisted that I did order it and wouldn't do anything about it. Never received such attitude at a restaurant. Highly recommend avoiding such an establishment."}
{"text":"(4.5) First impression is that this is the first time I've had fresh handmade noodles in the first time in my entire life that IS NOT my mom and omg is it so good.   The soup definately hits home right in the heart but the one noodle soup that WASNOT the classic and was not spicy (i tink it was B) was too star anise/clove-like flavour to my liking. Maybe that's how people in Lanzhou have it? I respect it but its not my bowl of soup.   Their different noodle sizes and shapes are so cool i love it so much. My favourite was the super tiny ones which is similar to vietnamese banh hoi. I had it wth the Beef Sauce one and omg it was so good.   The pickled cabbage wasn't pickled enough for my liking but thats ok thats just me. The pickled cucumber and wood ear mushroom on the other hand was sosour but so good, it was a really good palate cleanser! The chicken heart skewers were okay, more cooked/not as soft as I like it~   I really recommend this place if you're far away from home or you're homesick, or just in need of comfort food in the form of noodles handmade wit love this is the place to go, especially for the price offered: small is 8$ large is 9$.   Service was so friendly that I felt like I was surrounded by my bigger brothers, cousins, and uncles hahah. Will come again guys!"}
{"text":"Had the braised beef with extra thick noodles.  Noodles were insanely thick - probably should have gone one down.  I think you might get more noodles with the thinner cut?  The braised beef was nice and tender and the broth was tasty.  I've had better, but this makes the cut.  Side note:  The restaurant is very small and the bathroom is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"My favourite take-out place for Lanzhou hand pulled noodles. I always get the large beef brisket with medium flat noodles. The beef is juicy and the broth is so rich in beef flavour. It is truly a hidden gym with very friendly staff and nice prices. You never have to wait long for your order."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese hand pulled noodle I've eaten in Toronto!!! No doubt i would recommend it to anyone. Absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great hand pulled noodles. You can choose your own noodle thickness/shape and they will make it for you right on the spot. The braised beef was great. You could really taste the five spices and herbs that went into making it. The soup was not too salty so thst you could definitely sip it without needing a big gulp of water afterwards.  As for the lamb skewers/kebabs, it was a bit dry and it wasn't anything special.   Stick to the noodles and you will come back wanting more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant quietly opened in the heart of North York recently. Didn't know about it until I was picking up dinner from VIPS sushi next door. You can already smell the aroma coming out of the restaurant after you park your car on Byng!  Decided to give it a try on a Wednesday night at 9pm, we were the only customers thankfully, because it sure is small place! Usual takeout restaurant size.  We ordered the signature Braised Beef Brisket, one of the dishes that tells us if its cooking is authentic. We also ordered a plate of dumplings (8) wrapped with pork, chives and eggs.   The bowl is massive, thankfully we decided to share between 2 people. You get to choose your own thickness for the noodles, size and if you want to add extra meat.   We ordered the 2nd thickest noodle, yum! The best part that won my heart was the soup, not oily or heavy, purely flavourful. I usually don't dare to drink these noodle soups, but I sure did that night.  Their waitress was attentive and really friendly. The noodles were handmade on-site and the kitchen seemed clean. I sure do hope they keep this up.  If you're in North York for beef noodles, come give them a try! Or take it home to enjoy ;)  ps. Try their hot spicy oil, amazing!"}
{"text":"Dropped by 15 minutes before it closed, and they still served us a bowl of hot noodles and grilled egg plant.  Got the braised beef noodle soup (B) and it was much more satisfying than the one I got last time (bowl A). Comes with much more meat, noodles were chewier.  The broth still had a particularly...interesting...flavor that stood out, and I'm not sure what it was but it made my tongue all tingly."}
{"text":"Now that the weather is getting colder all I'm craving for are hot noodle soups, so I decided to give this place a try since its been all over social media. I ordered the beef with pickled mustard and shiitake mushroom with thick flat noodles and added an egg (fried egg).   Great portion size, I did enjoy the noodles, fresh and chewy, the only thing is, there were a few that were undercooked. The soup was very light and bland..I prefer my soup with more flavour. Out of the entire bowl, I only found one small piece of sliced shiitake mushroom.  Very tight and limited space inside. Service is good, there were two waitresses working at the time and food didn't take long to come. Small selection on the menu.   Overall thought? was not wowed about this place. Don't think it'll be a place I'd be going back to."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant recently and my expectation were seriously low. I've visited many restaurants that make Chinese food such as noodles but none compare to the quality and time put into these noodles. I'm not what it is but the noodle's texture is very satisfying in your mouth. I got the Braised Beef noodles and they were simply delicious. It has a nice spicy tasting broth that makes the already great noodles wonderful. I can't confirm if the noodle's actually hand made but it doesn't taste like the generic noodles you often get in restaurants nowadays. They also offer skewers that look great but I never tried it yet but I plan to on my next visit.  The servers were very nice and attentive. For the very small size of this restaurant it sure does get busy often in there. Even though it was seriously busy the owner (I presume it was at least) took his time and made sure all the customers were ok. There's also another guy who is very attentive to your needs/ wants. It looks like a restaurant that's run by family/ friends which I think are one of the best since all the employees cooperate with each other.   I'd highly recommend going to this restaurant for some good old Chinese noodles. The location is in a great area and the server's are nice. The only minor problem I found was probably room which can be a slight inconvenience, but to be fair the whole restaurant is small. I think they also offer takeouts but I'm not 100% sure, if so this would be a great place for takeouts."}
{"text":"Noodle was not chewy and broke apart so it means not fresh. Soup was so strong flavour of those chinese star herbs. Barely few slices of beef. We ate only half our bowl and left to eat somewhere else. Waste of money.... I will not be back"}
{"text":"Dropped by again to see how the food tasted given a few months since opening. Had the usual Braised Beef with Regular Round Noodles and they still have that lovely hearty depth of flavor with a slight zing from the Szechuan peppercorns. The broth has a lot more depth than that of Magic Noodle and does nit make your throat dehydrated from MSG overdose. The noodles are here are served A Le Dente to offer a bit more of a chew which contrasted the broth nicely, there is an option to have it cooked a bit more through upon request. Service is still top notch and attentive and I'm glad to see the food is still tasting great since opening. Oh yes I LOVE THE CHILI OIL."}
{"text":"I had the large classic beef with the thickest round noodles. I also tried the braised beef with the medium flat noodles.  The pulled noodles were ok (chewy as expected), but I've had better in downtown Toronto. The large size has a whole lot of noodles but very little meat. My bowl came with just a few slices of beef. I do have to say the broth was very tasty, especially with chili oil added.  At $8.99 for a large bowl, I think you could get more bang for your buck eating at other places in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Really good portions for a great price! Lots of noodles shop and popped up around the Yonge and Finch area in recent C months and having tried them all, this place is definitely my favourite! I'm impressed by the variety of noodles available and the friendly service just adds to this cozy spot! The only downside is that the space is very small. For a petite girl like me, that's not a big issue of I'm coming with a small group, but it is quite cramped. I wouldn't bring a big group here just because of the seating limits."}
{"text":"This is my only go-to place for hand-pulled noodles in Toronto! The beef brisket is a definite charmer and the variety of noodles is pretty good! Top that with friendly staff and all is set! Recommended, easily!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with this place after reading all the reviews. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup with the regular size noodles, and another time the classic version. The noodle texture was excellent. My issue is with the broth on both dishes.  People have different preferences but I think this place's broth is too salty. Is it MSG? I've tried braised beef noodle from various places and the flavor is always different depending on which region the owner or chef is from. Coming from this, I'd say there's a \"range\" of acceptable flavor for this particular dish. This is definitely the heaviest broth for this dish I've ever had. To top it off, the beef is not tender. It's wayyyy overcooked that it's tough. So I'd call this a failure. I can maybe give this place one more shot on their clear broth version but I wouldn't order the braised beef noodles here again.  Portion wise, I'd say it's on point. You could get pho if you really want bang for your buck. But for what you get, it's fair. $8.99 for large size and $7.99 for regular.   It's a really small place with limited seating. They have a table outside but winter is coming. The vibe is like one of those street stalls that sells noodles. Service is surprisingly nice. They refilled my water without asking which is actually not that common for a Chinese place."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the quality of the hand pulled flat thick noodles.  I had a tiny fear that they would have been hard and chewy since they were thicker noodles, but these were so soft and smooth.  The noodles submerged in the beef broth made it even more tasty with each slurp.  The thin slices of beef were perfect too.  If this bowl had too much beef, it would have made it too heavy to eat.  The bowl was mostly of noodles, which I liked.  There were actually a lot of noodles in the bowl too; it was filled up all the way from the bottom of the bowl to the top.  For the price of $7.99, I thought this was a very good deal!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, noodles were nicely made and chewy. However, I felt that the space was very cramped and it wasn't a very comfortable experience.   There was black stuff falling from the ceiling into the water/table and this is a serious health hazard, they need to get this fixed asap."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday evening at around 6pm alone. It's located a bit south of Yonge & Finch at Yonge & Byng. I walk by this place a lot and it usually fills up but it was empty when I got there.  Food ***** These guys are famous for their hand pulled noodles which they make fresh when you order. I got a small braised beef brisket bowl with pork belly skewers. Not sure how much larger the large is for $1 more but I was pretty satisfied with the portion of the small bowl. The broth was rich, the noodles delicious, and the beef tender, However, the highlight of the meal was the pork belly skewers. These things were amazing, perfectly crispy while tender. I debated getting another order.   Service *** The waiters are just alright in terms for attention. I was the only one eating there and service was just so-so. Nothing special, nothing bad. Though not sure how service quality might go if the place fills up with more people when you eat.  Ambiance *** Place is small; good for eating alone or with 1 or 2 other people. They have outdoor seating when the weather is nice and I feel like that would be the best place to eat instead of the crammed tables inside.  Tips/Closing comments - Pork belly skewers were amazing, definite must order. - Small sizes are already pretty filling so only order the large if you're super hungry."}
{"text":"I went to the Yonge and Finch location and was really happy with my experience. It's a tiny little shop that served handmade noodles. Although, there are only 4 dishes to choose from you have 6 types of noodles to choose from. I went with Flat Regular and the Classic Beef Bowl. They have two sizes, Small and Large, which are both less than $10! Good quality food, and large quantities for both sizes. Staff was great and overall experience went well, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pros: -pretty good noodles, I tried the braised beef and the shiitake mustard and I liked both -lamb skewers were good -pretty cool how you can choose the shape of your noodles, I personally like the skinny ones  Cons:  -environment is quite small and can be a bit uncomfortable if you have a bulky jacket but I assume this would be less of a problem in the warmer months  If I could I would actually rate this place a 4.5 instead of a 4. The overall experience was very pleasant and service as very good. The grilled zucchini was mediocre but everything else was yummy. I'd recommend this place for a casual meal!"}
{"text":"The taste is alright. But the service is really unorganized. Slowwwwwwwww....No water served all the way through. Waited for 40 mins for our noodles. Forgot our BBQ lamb. Only one cook, two waitors don't even have much to do."}
{"text":"this place has the look, but unfortunately it does not stand out, in aan area that is increasingly having more and more noodle restaurants as competition. its noodles are not that special, the price not that special, and the food it offers also not that special. the 3 star reflects the fact that the experience i would say its okay, but not amazing. it is definitely label as one of those restaurants that i've tried, don't hate it but don't love it either, so i will not go back most likely. since it doesnt' really have anything that intrigues me. the look and decorations of the place is nice, and the staff is friendly, overall the experience was not bad, however it is not a place i would specifically go out of my way to go to. for those who want to try the many noodle places in the area this place is one you could try, however for myself not one that i am particularly amazed by."}
{"text":"Came to big beef bowl for some noodles and soup. There are actually a few other small Chinese noodle restaurants within steps of each other. I haven't tried any of them so can't compare.    This location is a pretty small. There are limited bench seatings and limited table seatings. If you come to eat alone, you should t have any problems getting a seat. Bring a friend or two, should still be ok if it's not busy. The restaurant will not be able to accommodate you if you want to come with a large group.   Menu is simple. Order your desired main. Choose either large or small, choose whether you want round or flat noodles, as well as their thickness, and you are done.   I had a large braised beef bowl with round noodles in regular thickness. The broth was good and light on the taste. The peppercorn teases the tip of your tongue with that numbing feeling; and that's all it is, just an ever so subtle feeling. The braised beef sitting in there adds a bit of flavoring as well. The braised beef was done well. Regular, round noodles had the right texture and chew; your jaws won't be tired at the end of the meal.   If you come here, I recommend the braised beef noodle."}
{"text":"This has been on my list for a while. I'm glad I finally got the chance to go. I came here on a Friday night. It's a smaller space but they also have some seating outside. I opted for the beef bowl with pickled vegetables  and I added an egg with flat noodles. I was sort of expecting a ramen style soup egg but instead it was fried which was okay. The broth was light and the pickles served well as a palette cleanser. I especially loved the chilli oil (SO GOOD). The pork belly skewers were pretty decent as well. Overall, I loved it and look forward to returning (so comforting)."}
{"text":"The service was amazing here. Kind of surprising and refreshing. They were very attentive to us, refilling our water and making sure we had everything we needed. Small place with 4 or 5 tables but they are efficient in getting ppl in and out. Tried the noodle with the pickeled mustard. Thought it was delicious. I can walk to this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious noodles, but the appetizers were a bit pricey. Like most noodle soup joints, expect to be thirsty after."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant around Yonge & Finch.  There's a few selection of beef noodles and you can select from round or flat noodles and they come in various sizes. I went with the braised beef brisket and selected the flat regular noodle. It honestly wasn't that spicy at all so don't let that stop you from ordering it. My sister went with the classic beef with the fat thick noodle (the thickest noodle you can ask for) and it was very delicious as well. Cant wait to come back and try all the other noodle sizes!"}
{"text":"The beef noodle is good. The place is not as big as expected. It would be better if the place could be expanded because the inside looks nice."}
{"text":"First of all, this place offers exceptional fresh pulled noodles and is definitely a must visit if you are in the area.  However, this place isn't suitable for big groups chit chats or get-together, dates or long conversations  especially when its get quite busy as this is really a tiny place.  This  restaurant is mainly for a QUICK BITE.. If you want to find a casual place to stay long and chit chat, may I suggest to go to a BTT place instead or to a restaurant nearby where it isn't as busy or occupied?       This place is  small and so tiny regardless on how optimizing the restaurant is really trying to use all their available space.  They currently have outside seating but when comes winter, the outside seatings will disappear.   Maximum seating minus outside seats 14 seats!  You can tell the restaurant really wants the business.. they would always have workers go outside if they see people standing outside hesitating or turn around thinking it was busy when patrons see a line-up at the door thinking it would be a long wait...  so I am quite confused with the restaurant when they have tables sitting there for super long and chit chatting even when done eating.  The restaurant does not seemed to make much of an effort to help the waiting patrons reduce the wait time. Papa chang used to do that .. but after a few complaints and some patrons got mad,   they tell tables when done eating, please help us out as we have people waiting, even when tables asked for the bill, paid  but yet, still stayed to chit chat.   Papa chang is now quick at turning tables around and the wait time is barely 10 minutes for a table.   Getting back to this, I just came back from lunch and unfortunately it wasn't a good experience  as I had wanted to be as me as my friend ended up waiting over 30 minutes for a table.  My friend who initially was not in a hurry but with the long wait, ended being very strict on time as she had to go to the airport to pick up her sister later on after this lunch.   As we kept waiting,  we noticed there was a group of 3 that were pretty much done (except for one girl who kept playing with her food) but still took their sweet time, They knew we were waiting for a long time but simply didn't care.. even after dropping not one or two but three hints in Cantonese and English, they still stuck on and just went on chit chatting about life in general.   I mean really??  They were not in a hurry and were making plans to go elsewhere anyway to chat and yet refused to budge and leave.    We finally asked the staff if me and my friend could order first and split up and sit the tables with one tiny seat left while we wait for the group to clear out as it was obvious the group refused to budge and leave and also, our feet were getting really tired.  At first the girl said no but after she checked with the big boss, they were able to accommodate and let us order first. ALLELUIA!!!  I always make the effort to try to move out of the way to another  table or try to accommodate the restaurant especially when it becomes so busy and if there are people waiting or a big group who comes in and want to sit together.   i know how  hard it can be for a restaurant trying to survive and how frustrating it is to wait for 30 minutes +while standing... I guess that is the difference between me and others.  I  don't overstay my welcome.  Minus all that, I would recommend to go either during their non busy times or just get take out or go elsewhere if it is pretty busy unless u don't mind the long wait.  I recommend the big bowl of braised beef noodles, in which I chose the big thick freshly pulled noodles as it is my favourite of all noodles :)  The braised beef was soft and tender and I wouldn't mind paying extra for the extra meat as that is how good it is and this has become my new favourite place for braised beef noodles.  I also got the spicy BBQ corn which  I love because it is so gooey with the cheese and is a great addition as as a snack  I noticed a lot of people got the radish as a side dish but I didn't opt for that I am not crazy about it.   Me and my friend were done in 20 minutes for those wondering how long it took for us to be there and eat.. we were effective and ate fast as we saw more and more people waiting.   Overall, it is a must try minus the long wait.  Go check it out :)."}
{"text":"I love handpulled noodles and the noodles here did not disappoint. Very chewy! Portions were great too. Only thing is the braised beef was fatty, but yummy enough that I would come back."}
{"text":"2.8/5 This place deserve 3.5 stars but damn the cashier / waitress girl is a total miss attitude. I get that you are tired and don't want to be at work but you are still getting paid. so do a proper job and don't treat your customers like they are worthless and wasting her precious time from cellphone.   Otherwise their noodles are all good. Three diff types of dishes: braised beef soup, mushroom & pickled veggie soup(not vegetarian friendly though) and dry noodles with meat sauce. After you choose that and u get to choose diff types of hand made fresh noodles. Would recommend every noodles on the menu. Unfortunately broth can be little light depends on the time of the day but you can request minced garlic to add in your noodle soup. It definitely enhance the flavour of the broath. Skewers are nothing to write home about though.   Place is very small and tight. More suitable for take out.   I personally just do take out and add a spoonful of minced garlic and black bean chili oil to spice up the soup. Great comfort food.  What a shame for decent noodle bar to have a untrained staff. But I seriously can't get pass by their staff's attitude issue so I think I'll avoid the place for a while."}
{"text":"got beef noodle with pickled mushroom and mustard, bbq pork skewer and oyster mushroom. What I really like is the cilantro and green onions are chopped to very tiny piece such that you won't actually taste them and yet have their flavor in the noodle soup. However the bbq mushroom could use more time as it's not well done."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out the noodles at this growingly popular restaurant. This was our third time trying this place. The menu is simple with 4 choices of noodles in soup and quite. Few side dishes. Each bowl of noodle is quite similar with variations with beef, lamb or spicy.  We really liked having the 6 different styles of noodles.  I personally enjoy the regular round and regular flat.  After eating, my wife and I became very very thirty for quite a while which indicates MSG.  We sincerely enjoy the noodles but will think twice about coming here because of the MSG."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice. It's a tiny place. Probably seats around 20. There is not a lot of variety in the menu. They sell mostly noodle soup and dumplings. They let you choose the thickness and shape of the noodles. The first time I came, I ordered the flat and wide noodles. This time got thin flat beef noodle soup with pickled vegetables. The difference in price between the medium and large bowl was only $1 so ordered the big bowl. The bowl was big and the noodles yummy. Only thing, not enough meat."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on BlogTO and since it's in my neighborhood, I had to try it because the photos on BlogTO looked so good! I came here with my fiancé one evening, I got their signature beef tenderloin noodles with the thickest noodle, and my fiancé ordered another one with the second thickest noodle. We also got lamb kebobs. Everything tasted amazing, the beef was so easy to chew, and the noodles were so chewy and full of flavor. I added a lot of hot sauce into my soup, also some vinegar, I loved every bite. The lamb kebob was also delicious, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Broth lacked taste. The noodles were good but nothing super special. The toppings of beef, mushrooms and pickled something (can't remember what it was exactly...) Were good but not enough for the entire soup. The portion of small was good however the toppings were not enough. I might try one more time to see if they'd change my mind but this place wouldn't be a priority.  Space itself was small and tight. Very poor ventilation when it's hot. Seating outside but no servers come outside to check on you unless they're bringing out your orders. The servers don't speak English very well."}
{"text":"Ugh forgot to take a picture.  This place has gone downhill.  The insanely small amount of meat seemed quite unacceptable.  The soup base & noodles were good but so little meat....Even the amount of radish was little... Basically felt like eating bowl of plain noodles.  It USED to have more meat and was quite good....But now........2.5stars at the most."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan. Oily and bland broth. Noodle texture ok. I was hoping for something more flavourful like ramen. Guess its just not my thing."}
{"text":"You are spoiled for choice in this area if you are craving food from any of the Asian countries. This little place caught my eye as it was packed with people, spilling out into the tables on the street. The vibe is very casual, almost like a street stall you may find whipping out bowls of noodles for the hungry masses.  The main thing here is obviously the noodles. I had the flat large noodles with the beef, pickled mustard and shiitake mushroom broth option. The flat large noodles was a delight, as they are less frequently seen and were very good. Great texture, and the right balance between chewy and tender. The broth was flavorful without being too salty or heavy. In summary, a delicious big beef bowl."}
{"text":"Found this place from a friend ... it is so hidden, I wouldn't have known if I didn't try to look for it! Tucked away in the corner, the noodles here are to die for! Yum! They taste bouncy and fresh. I chose the regular round noodles and also tried the thick round noodles.. I think the regular round was best for the noodles in soup. The beef brisket is also really good, but unfortunately there are very few pieces in the bowl. Broth was great as well, light and flavorful. Large was actually quite a lot of noodles. There is very limited seating so be aware of that when planning to eat here."}
{"text":"I had big hopes for this non-franchise noodle restaurant that's tucked away along the few other shops aligned on the south side of Byng.  First off, it's all about the noodles. I ordered thickest round ones for the no soup minced pork/beef noodles.   I took a bite and the noodles was harder to chew and when I looked at the center of the noodle, it was not fully cooked. It definitely needed to be cooked a lot longer.   Pretty much the noodles ended the whole experience since it was the main event. I meant the meat and the sauce was good, but the noodles had to be cooked right to make the whole dish an A+. Today it got an D.  I hope if I ever do go back, the noodles will be we'll done.  However, what I do like about the place is: Only a few items to choose from Price is very reasonable (for north york standards)  More luck to you guys!"}
{"text":"The good: one of the better hand pulled Chinese noodle houses I have been to in Toronto. The menu is very selective with 3-5 noodle flavours - thus far all of which were very satisfying to try. You get to choose type of noodles and size of noodles. Soup base here is very good. Price wise it's on point :)  The bad: the seating is horrid. It's a very small space, and even within that space the seating is very close to each other. I could only imagine in winter time this place will be super cramped with all the winter jackets around the place.  The ugly: nothing too ugly here.  Neutral: it will get packed (cause it's small) during dinner hours. Takeout is an option."}
{"text":"Does anyone know what happened to this store? It's no longer there??! I'm so sad, it's one of my go-to places! Help me find them!"}
{"text":"Big Beef Bowl is a great addition to the block! I ordered the braised brisket with thick round noodles and it came with a large amount of noodles and broth! So tasty and flavourful and the brisket was cooked well and not chewy. The soup that came with my noodles was spicy but they give you a side of chili oil as well. The spiciness was just enough for me and I can usually handle spice. Some of the flavours included star anise and szechuan hot peppers (makes your tongue a bit numb), and were very fragrant.  I would definitely come back here (probably for takeout, because it gets quite busy in this small restaurant). The cost is about $10 per person including taxes. I love that they provide a plastic bowl for takeout orders too! :)"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place when I saw the great reviews.  Most reviewers made this place seem like a little jem.  Unfortunately, that was far from the case.  I had the much suggested braised beef and was sadly disappointed.  The beef was more than 50% fat which I had a hard time tearing from the good meat.  And the much hyped noodles were nothing special at all.  Definitely not coming back here again.  On a positive note, the waitress that served us was super attentive.  ********************* And in response to the reply I just received from \"Big Beef Bowl\", I've had tendon before many times (I've even lived in Hong Kong and travelled extensively throughout China, Japan, Vietnam and other countries in that region) and what I had here was not it.  Maybe I got a \"bad bowl\", I don't know.  But the fact that my friend barely touched his bowl, also should be noted."}
{"text":"Very large serving of hand pulled noodles. A large bowl is very large. Wish they'd add more meat to the order. Noodles were great and I'm glad there are many options on thickness and shape. Beef was ok tender. Soup was the weak link as it wasn't anything outstanding. I added their spicy sauce but didn't find it as good as other restaurant spices.   But for the price and the amount of noodles, this place is worth eating at again.   3 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Byng Ave. this place serves mainly beef noodles. I decided to try the classic beef noodle. When you order you have a choice of the circular noodles of various thickness or the flat noodles with various widths. The preparation time wasn't too long so the noodle was served in about 5 minutes. It was served in a large bowl with lots of noodles and a few small slices of beef. The broth itself was a tad salty but it was decent. The service was good as they kept refilling our cups with water and checking up on us every so often. The location is relatively small with enough seats for maybe 15 people and 2 bar stool type of seats facing the window. There is street parking right outside or you can park along Kenneth Ave as well. In terms of the Classic Beef noodle itself I would give it a 2.5/5 as it was a little plain. However the service was pretty good so I would give it a 3/5"}
{"text":"Ordered the large beef brisket. It was huge! Don't order the large unless you're absolutely starving. The brisket added a nice flavour to the broth.  Could've used a touch more salt for my taste but I tend to like things on the saltier side. Would've gave it a higher rating but I found the amount of pepper in it, either in the noodles or the broth was too overpowering for my liking. If that's not your thing then maybe ask for less pepper of that's an option. Also ordered pork belly skewers, those were well seasoned and nicely cooked."}
{"text":"Beef noodle lovers assemble!!  Pros: Hand pulled noodles made to order Very good beef noodle  Cons: Location is small  I'm a huge fan of beef noodles so when I saw this place open so close to home, I had to check it out.  I had to get take out because my little one wasn't feeling well but I will definitely be back to try it in house.  This place is tiny.  There are maybe 10 seats total here.  Take out will seem to be the most  viable option.  It's a shame because beef noodle should be eaten piping hot right there.  Other than that though, this place is pretty darn good.  As you can see from the menu, this place specializes in one thing and one thing only, beef noodle.  The good thing is they do a pretty good one.  As you can see from the menu I posted, you have 4 types to choose from.  I ordered the classic beef and the braised beef brisket.  From there, you choose the type of noodle you want.  You can choose from 3 thicknesses of round noodle, 3 thicknesses of flat noodle and a triangle (WHAT??) noodle.  All the noodles are hand pulled on the premises which is great.  The noodles themselves were all very good.  The broth, which is super important to a good bowl of beef noodle was very flavourful.  The brisket was very tender which is a huge plus.  The other beef noodles in the area all had tougher beef to chew through which made it much tougher to choose.  I'm going to have to say this is the best braised beef noodle in the North York area.  The service was very good even though I was only taking out.  The waitress was very nice and patient running through the menu with me seeing it was my first time.  I was even given a potato salad entree for free as well!    If you're a fan of beef noodle, you need to give this place a try.  I know I will!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite small. Maximum 10-13 people.   Their menu is quite simple, we ordered the beef brisket. Noodles were very tasty, the broth resembled a pho-like broth. The meat was average, but I really enjoyed the broth and noodles.   They take interac and cash only"}
{"text":"There are those evenings when nothing hits the spot like a ginormous bowl of beef noodles. With a name like Big Beef Bowl, and a menu consisting of truly epic beef noodle bowls, this place is the place.  Oh, and did I mention that Bruce Lee looks over you while you kungfu your spicy brisket noodles?"}
{"text":"This is a really small place with only three sit down tables and two bar wall desks with stools to sit on.   I really enjoy coming here to eat their noodles.  What I really like about this place is the peppercorn soup.   You can definitely taste the peppercorn as it sinks into my tongue.  You can order small or large but the small really is enough for a single person.   I always get the mustard vegetable beef bowl.   The noodles tastes good and when I am done with all the beef and noodles, I drink their soup broth with nothing left on the bowl.   I asked if they use MSG and they don't which is good news."}
{"text":"This place is serves mainland chinese hand-pulled noodles. I had the spicy brisket, which had a giant chili beside it. It was spicy, but not unbearable, as I expected it when I ordered. It was \"ma-la\" spicy meaning your mouth will tingle a bit. Weird feeling, but enjoyable.   The soup was pretty flavorful and was surprisingly clear, before mixing in spicy beef brisket sauce. I got the flat wide noodles and they were very good. Al dente with a good chew. Comes in two sizes. Small is enough for average hunger.   The space inside is tiny. Probably sits about 12-14 people at a time, so there was a bit of a line up when we went. Its pretty difficult to get a spot for groups of 3+, but 2 is generally not too bad. Generally the pairs eat quickly and leave. Service is as expected for a high turnover place."}
{"text":"small location, but clean and organized.  nice soup base!"}
{"text":"Big Beef Bowl on Byng has closed!!!!  Does anyone know if they've moved?  Loved this place!!!"}
{"text":"i'm usually a noodle fanatic but I did not enjoy my classic beef bowl (option A) with extra thick \"noodles\" at all. For some reason the extra thick \"noodles\" seemed like a good idea to me but DO NOT get it unless you want to eat dumpling skin. I put noodles in quotation marks because it shouldn't even be classified as noodles lol. I guess i can only blame myself for ordering something so gimmicky? The \"noodles\" were sooo thick that i couldn't even finish half of it and that's rare for me. The thick noodles and the soup just didn't compliment each other at all. The soup is pungent and salty but lacks depth... Kind of reminded me of instant noodle soup seasoning."}
{"text":"Try: Hand-pulled noodle (round regular) with meat sauce  The first thing that you notice about this place is that it's tiny. My mom almost wanted to turn around and leave when she saw the set up, but it was a Tuesday and surrounding shops were closed, so why not...  We ordered B (braised beef brisket) with flat regular noodles, and D (meat sauce) with round regular noodles. I really liked D, it came with al-dente noodles topped with flavorful ground beef sauce, and a healthy portion of refreshing cucumbers. The B was nothing spectacular, a handful pieces of beef (a little too lean and dry), and the noodle was too hard for my liking. The broth was quite hearty, and you get to add your own chili, which I kind of liked.   Overall a satisfactory experience. I don't think I will be in a rush to return though.  WYWH"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese hand-pulled noodles (la mian).  I'm not much of a noodle person but this place has totally changed my mind.  The place was really small with a few tables and 2 counters.  We managed to get 3 spots at the counter for lunch today.  The menu is basically a selection of braised beef noodle soup but you choose the soup style and noodle type ( round, flat, etc) for about $8.  We got the classic beef with medium round noodles and the pickle mustard with mushroom with small round noodles.  The soup noodles was served  piping hot and flavour was very tasty with a peppery taste to it.  I really enjoy the noodles with pickle mustard.  We also got two appetizers - cucumber with black fungus salad and chicken hearts skewers which were also really good.  We will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Service is pretty friendly and quick.  The space is very tight in between of each table, but most of the noodles restaurants in the same area have the same issue.   The noodles texture is very al dente and nicely done; portion of the noodles is generous. You can choose different thickness of the noodles. I love the wider ones. However, the meat (beef or brisket) topping is very little and thin. I think the main reason I gave only 3 stars is the temperature of the broth is only room temperature which I don't really enjoy... I like hot noodle soup!  And I wish the meat sauce noodles is more spicer..."}
{"text":"A very small noodle restaurant that serves a good and warm bowl of hand-pulled noodles. I got attracted to Big Beef Bowl since they hand-pull their noodles right in front of you. I came an hour before closing and it wasn't that busy. I got a small beef noodle bowl, the server suggested I get the regular round noodle size, so I did. It tasted good but nothing outstanding. The dish does contain cilantro for those people who don't like it. Also, the restaurant is really small...the seating area is smaller than your commin bedroom. Service was fast though."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. Had the classic noodle with medium size round noodles. This is a small little place but lucky on Sunday lunch time there was spots without waiting. This place is a bit crampes but they have hooks for you to hang your jackets. They have a big table of 4, 3 seats on stools facing the wall, 2 stool seats facing the windo outside and 2 tables for 2 ppl. The soup tastes good and service was great. Just wished the beed slices were a bit thicker. Felt like not enough beef and daikon (too much noodle). Will come back since I am living nearby but will not purposely make a special trip to come here."}
{"text":"Dad and I came here for a quick dinner. I ordered the small bowl with pickled vegetables and beef while he ordered the small original.   Portion sizes were huge! My dad went to the washroom and when he got back he asked me if they made a mistake and gave us larges.   The noodles were tasty and had a great texture to them.  The broth was light and complimented the noodles. It was a bit spicy, which is to be expected. It's the type of spicy that slightly tingles your mouth rather than Korean spicy food though. The beef was really tender as well.  Ambience was ... distracting. Don't come here with a group larger than 4. Also it's extremely noisy here and a bit too hot.   My tip for you if you have 2 people: order a large portion and share it between you.  Tl;dr Come here for a cheap filling hot meal with authentic Chinese noodles. Not for groups."}
{"text":"These guys are finally open! I honestly did not have any expectations in the beginning since there are a few LanZhou hand pulled noodles shops around the area already. Man was I wrong, their noodles are deRicious and they are absolutely economical and hugge!!!  The chef and staff are one of the most hardworking and nicest people I have met in my life.. they are there pulling noodles 24/7.. constantly trying to make improvements on their service and THAT, really won my heart.   Yes, the shop is small and it can only accomodate small parties and probably only 8-10 people at a time. I wouldnt suggest you to come during peak hours... take out might be a solution.  I really really love their meat sauce noodles... it has officially become my go-to comfort food :)! Woohoo!  Support local business!!"}
{"text":"This place specializes in hand pull noodles. You pick your type of soup and then the type of noodles you want, there are 7 options - from thin to thick, to triangle shape.  Braised beef brisket with thick noodles ($7.99 for small bowl)    The beef brisket was roasted prior to adding into the soup noodles so it was marinated and flavorful. However the brisket could be more tender and soft. I personally like the fat thick noodles, nice and chewy. Not sure why there's a pepper beside this on the menu since it wasnt spicy at all. The soup tasted like the classic beef soup, went well with all the ingredients. Really tasty.   Beef with pickled mustard and shitake mushroom with thin noodles ($7.99 for small bowl)  The braised beef were thin pieces but super soft. The soup was really peppery making it spicy but slightly sour because if the pickled veggies. The flavor was really strong because I could even taste the soup flavor through the noodles.  We also tried the lamb skewers, $3.99 for 2 pieces. This was disappointing - wasnt well marinated or flavorful even though it had a lot of hot spices on it. The meat were small pieces too. I would skip ordering the sides.  I really liked the soup base and the noodles though, would come back for the soup noodles!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for cheap filling chinese noodles in North York. They only have four main dishes on their menu so you know it's going to be good. They also offer six different type of hand pulled noodles (thin, regular and thick of both flat and round noodles). One thing to note is that there are only two sizes, small and large. This place really lives up to their name because the portions are HUGE.   My favourite is their minced pork mixed noodles with a lot of their spicy oil. Their soup-based noodles are very light in flavour but still very delicous."}
{"text":"Great place for hand-pulled noodles! I got the regular beef with medium-sized noodles. I don't get these very often but they seemed very fresh and the broth was tasty too. This was a cozy little place with limited seating but I very much enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"Really good noodles. Try the braised beef! Portions are generous and staff was helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I had beef brisket with thin flat noodles and corn skewers. The portions are huge (even the 'small'). When I was full it looked like I had barely ate any. It was a bit spicy (which I like) but otherwise quite bland. Noodles were all stuck together and difficult to eat. Sauce was too thin and not tasty enough to stick to the noodles so just felt like a mouthful of plain noodles. Even added extra spice sauce on each spoonful but didn't help.   Corn skewers were great though! Spicy.   Service was quite bad. Cold, abrupt, non-attentive - even in such a tiny space I felt ignored and always had to ask for things...extra napkins, more water, etc. I was so thirsty and wanted nothing more than a big glass of ice water to which they brought me a tiny tea cup of lukewarm tap water - gross! No ice, they said.   Overall, I have this new little noodle shop a try and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yuck.  The 2 of us came on a Thursday around 1pm so got a seat rather easily but this place is TINY. I assume if you come at night there will be quite a wait (but don't come here at night - or ever - it sucks). Only two main tables and two small 'bar seating' areas with about 2 seats each fills this super tiny, hot and poorly ventilated space. You can see the cook right behind a glass partition sweating fiercely as he prepares the food, sweat pouring down his face as he leans over the bowls of noodles he is dishing up (gross).  We got two bowls of noodles. One spicy and one regular. One with beef slices and one with beef brisket. Both with thick noodles:  1) spicy and regular soup taste the same - like nothing! Where is the meaty yummy bone tasting broth that soup should have? (also which part of my water broth was the spicy part?) If I wanted boiled plain water broth I could just make it myself at home :/  2) Sliced beef was alright. Brisket was super fatty/chewy/tough/inedible/nasty. In both cases the meat to bowl ratio sucked. There were only about three small slices in each of our big ass bowls. #cheap  3) Thick noodles taste and feel like under-cooked dumpling skin. Bleh. If you advertise as having delicious hand pulled noodles then please make sure it doesn't taste like a raw dumpling  We also got the grilled corn app which was doused in chili pepper ruining any kind of good the dish could have had (and also our tastebuds).  We left stinky, sweaty, $30 poorer and still hungry.  Go to pho or ramen or soondubu if you are craving soup. Don't come here. It sucks!"}
{"text":"I love loveeee big beef bowl. Its a literal hole in the wall, with seating barely enough for 20 if you include the outdoor seating. They offer homemade noodles in 6 configurations of different thickness and shapes, paired with various meat and soup options; skewers including corn, pork belly, and cumin lamb skewers; dumplings.   My friends and I sat outdoors, ordered a couple of skewers and a bowl of brisket noodles each. Even their regular size was a generous portion of both noodles and meat. The bits of green onion (for which I removed), tender daikon slices, and chunks of succulent brisket sat beside the bundle of noodles immersed in a clear golden broth. The broth had a deeply savoury flavour, with a medium body, and surprisingly clean (minimally oily) mouthfeel. The addition of the chili oil elevated it further and it was sheer pleasure to bathe spoonfuls of their meat and noodles in this broth. Their noodles are great too, absorbing the broth's flavour and just a touch softer than al dente.   I would eat here everyday if I could. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"There aren't many hand pulled noodle shops in the city yet, so this place is a nice change. I got the beef brisket with the funny looking triangle noodles. The beef brisket was so tender and delicious. The broth was alright and only slightly spicy despite the big red pepper they had on the menu. The letdown was surprisingly the noodles. It's much chewier than I'm used to, which doesn't work well with big noodles like the one I chose. I'd pick the thinnest noodles available next time because of the chewiness and firmness. The place is tiny so expect to wait or get it as takeout."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so tiny and it has 3 tables (2 very small tables and a bigger one) . It is definitely not comfortable to eat. The only meat choice is beef. If you don't eat beef, don't go.   I had the beef brisket noodles. The beef and the noodles were good, but the soup was super oily. It looked like they just poured the beef brisket from an oily pot straight to the bowl. And I felt the soup tasted like dish detergent.  It could be the spices they put in the soup. Hopefully it wasn't the fact they poured the dish detergent to the soup by mistake.   As the food wasn't amazing, and the seating was very uncomfortable. It is a NO for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is memorable for various reasons. This is the tiniest restaurant i have ever encountered.   So, with the limited seats availability, my friends and i decided to sit out at the patio.  I noticed that people were lining up to be seated. When it comes to ordering our food, i decided to order beef tendon soup noodles.  There's a choice of noodles to go with the soup so i chose thin round noodles.  Also there's a choice of small or large bowl.  I chose large for around $8.   The food came pretty quickly.  Mine was pretty tasty.  The soup was supposed  to be spicy but i didn't find that the case.  I ended up adding chilli sauce to mine.  The tendons were tender although there weren't many pieces.  The round thin noodles were good. I want to come back again to try other dishes.  For the price i paid for the size of the meal, it was decent."}
{"text":"I came here a few times before and I enjoyed eating here. However today's visit was very different.   First off the staff is still great. That factor hasn't changed. The noodles are still very good.  However, it can only go so far.  The amount of meat in their small beef noodle feels much less than before.  I was trying to dig around after eating the noodles to see if there was any meat left because I didn't think I ate that much.  Unfortunately, no avail.  The soup base itself seems to have changed their recipe.  Its either excessively peppered and/or they added MSG to the soup base which is the main factor why the rating today is so low.  My tongue felt really tingly while I was just eating the noodles that I barely drank the soup.  So much so that once I had finished eating I noticed that the soup level barely dropped.  I couldn't bear to drink the soup and I also noticed my companion didn't drink her soup either.  I probably won't come here by choice for a while, today's experience was that bad."}
{"text":"Great value, delicious soup and good portions. I got the classic beef noodle, the broth was good wasn't too salty and was exactly what you would expect from homemade beef soup. the noodles were great and we got to see them being made behind the counter as the chef cooked them. I enjoyed the whole experience. Large portion sizes I got the large and couldn't finish.  We also got some apps, grilled chicken leg and squid. These were good but not great. The highlight is definitely the soup!   This is a small little place with a couple of seats, we stayed there the first time but since the seating is so limited we have ordered out the last couple of times. I would say this is the only down side- you're really rubbing elbows with the other guests.  It's very good and I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"For simple, fast, and hand-pulled beef noodle soup, I always go to Big Beef Bowl. It's a tiny noodle eatery with a big heart for service and flavor. I like how you can choose the noodle type (ie. Round vs wide, thick vs thin) and bowl size. I usually order the beef brisket with regular round noodles in a small size. If you're extra hungry, then perhaps have a go of their large bowl! It's pretty big so be prepared!   Meanwhile, there are also side bbq appetizers to order like mushrooms and chicken heart (I'll pass on that but I know others folks that love that!).   Lastly, the coolest thing I like about this place is their Bruce Lee art of him pulling noodles. It's a fun and unique attraction, and somehow inspires me to do something fun afterwards."}
{"text":"First off, don't be upset for the low rating.  5+++ stars for the noodle 3 stars for the broth better but still lacks depth and the braised beef was just better 1 star for the restaurant, really really small and really hot.  Take out is better but you need to eat the noodle asap. Doesn't taste as good reheated."}
{"text":"One of the best Lanzhou handmade noodles in Toronto. 6 different varieties of noodles provides 6 unique taste. The beef is insanely good as well. Even though the store is small and waiting in line is not that comfortable during winter time but worth the waiting."}
{"text":"A very small restaurant with just a few seating that's very cramped. But their soup base is pretty on point. Had the spicy braised beef noodles and the broth was very flavourful. The pulled noodles are pretty good also - it has a good texture. I like that you can choose between different sizes of noodles. I've been here twice already and will come back again if I'm ever craving for Chinese soup noodles (:"}
