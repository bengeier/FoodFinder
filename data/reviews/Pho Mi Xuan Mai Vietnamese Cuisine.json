{"text":"3rd time here. It's a bit of a hole in the wall but the food is decent. I previously had the Bún mm which isn't served at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga. Today I ordered pho with beef and tendon because I love me some tendon. Unfortunately we were informed that the were out of tendon. Disappointing. So I got the my tho soup. I have had this soup hundreds of times at many Vietnamese restaurants and this was the first time ever it had wontons as well as tofu. It seemed more Chinese than Vietnamese. We were seated at a table for six even though there were 2 of us and smaller tables available. Also this place only takes cash."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and won't be our last! A friend recommended the Bún Mm here and said it was the best in Mississauga, so we decided to give it a try. 

My husband ordered the Bún Mm and I had the pork hock and shrimp soup. He agreed it was the best Bún Mm he's had (tried it in 4 restaurants so far). The broth was so tasty within being too sweet. And there was plenty of protein in it. 

The pork hock and shrimp soup was delicious! The broth was delicious and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. I loved that the pork hock was in slices instead of large pieces on the bone as it's served in some other Vietnamese restaurants. The noodles were very thick glass noodles and matched the dish perfectly. 

The server was very friendly and efficient. 

We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We came here bc my friend highly recommends their Bun Bo Hue and he's right, pretty good but it lacks the correct side vegetables, they gave cabbage and mung bean instead of the banana fruit veggies. It stops there, their Cha gio is alright, skip their fresh coconut and their sour sop smoothie is watered down. Pho had tough meat and their bun Rieu was just alright. Will stop by here for bun bo hue if we're in the area but won't go out of our way to come here anymore. 
They only take cash. 
Mom and pop shop and all its attachment."}
{"text":"This place is 200% authentic Vietnamese cuisine and dining experience (which isn't all that positive).  You rarely will find anyone that's not Vietnamese dining here due to the abundant bigger name Pho restaurants (Pho Dau Bo, Pho Hung, I Love Pho) seconds-to-minutes away.  This place is popular amongst the older male Vietnamese drinkers who will stay in the restaurant for hours late at night before heading home.  This creates a rather sketchy, unpleasant dining experience, which is why I usually just order take-out.  

The food here on the other hand can be great but often inconsistent.  Since it is a smaller-run restaurant, they are often out of ingredients for 75% of the menu.  Nevertheless, the rice dishes here are their strong suit, in addition to their family-style meals.  Their smoothies are average (if they have the ingredients necessary).  

Don't expect too much from the service either since the only time you'll see the one server is when she comes to take orders, and bring your meals; otherwise be prepared to flag her down if you ever need something.  

Overall, an authentic Vietnamese restaurant with good rice dishes but the inconsistencies and lack of ingredients are hard to ignore.  Otherwise, the attraction of older Vietnamese drinking audiences may cause you to consider either ordering take-out or visiting other nearby restaurants."}
