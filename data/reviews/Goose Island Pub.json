{"text":"Stopped here with friends on a Wednesday night.  The service was slow, but the atmosphere is nice and the beer was cold!! And that's always a good thing.  The menu wasn't too exciting, but the grilled cheese with chips hit the spot.  and did I mention the beer was cold?  All in all, I'd go back.  Just ramp up the service and you could have a winner."}
{"text":"Just like the other reviews, the service was awful. Being a Chicagoan and lover of Goose Island, I'm disappointed the service could continue to be that bad. Our original waitress didn't come back to take our food order, so the other waitress had to come take it...eventually. Once we were done eating, we continued to sit without anyone checking up on us for additional drinks, etc.  There was a private event going on and the two waitress were over there looking at some product versus helping the actual patrons. Seriously?"}
{"text":"I was staying at Hard Rock and walked in for a sandwich and to play some video poker. My bartender was Mady, and she was awesome! Great energy and conversation. She made my visit memorable and made me feel very welcome! My sandwich was good I got the caprese wrap. It was over dressed.. but I didn't even care because the hospitality was out of this world! Thanks for the good times!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible for was great. Waitress wouldn't check if needed drink refills didn't asked if we needed anything.  Basically took are order and brought it to us when it was ready if we wanted more to drink my husband would have to go up to or try to flag down a waitress. He even had to flag her down for the check. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the service."}
{"text":"What a joke. My fiance and I were happy to give this place a try. Boy, did we get our hopes up for nothing. I should of known that it would be a crappy experience since Budweiser bought them. We walk in and surprised it was so dull and boring looking inside. Being in the Hard Rock, we expected something sleek and modern. Nope, dull colors and boring. We stand waiting a few minutes since it said a hostess will seat us. The workers looking like chicken with their heads cut off. We finally get to sit, and then that's all. We sit and wait. Servers all huddled around one register to ring up. It was sad. We finally get napkins with utensils from a guy wearing a shirt with no name tag. That was unsettling or maybe a customer who feels the pain of horrible service. After 10 min and no one asking us for a drink order, we were done. Maybe we should go to the bar area. It's less packed. Before we go to the bar, we thought we were seeing things when a server comes in from the casino with a tray of food. Whaaaaaat Theeeee FUUUUUUCCK!!! Then another guy comes in with a cart and food orders. REALLY???? You mean to tell me, they build a brew pub with the kitchen not connected lol. That is very unsettling and who knows what kind of shit can go in your food as they are coming in from the casino. Sure, it has a lid, but a grubby ass person can ask for something and distract the server and someone else fucks with your food. Gross!!! If i'm gonna get my food violated, I'd rather it be in the same place im sitting at lol. So, we head to the bar and grab a spot so we can order a Goose Island IPA. We sit, and wait. One bartender looks at us, then proceeds to say that someone will help us. Really dude!!! You are just standing there and can't even take a drink order. A few minutes go by and no one helps us, so we leave. We were hoping to have a great time and check out this new brew pub and all we got was a sour taste in our mouth and not even sure if we would ever go back and give it a try. Horrible service like that is not cool. I can go get Goose Island draft at most places, so im not losing out. Anyways, Till Next Time.......Let's Eat!!"}
{"text":"Great brewery!   I was thrilled to see an own pub from the brewery and had their wheat beer and played some poker.  If you put on 20,  your drink is comped.. Not bad, eh!  They serve snacks too but nothing that caught my attention.   Nice atmosphere and great beer. What more can one ask?"}
{"text":"I stopped in later in the evening for a beer on a Saturday because I wanted to try some of the other brews from Goose Island while this place was handy.  My wife is a fan of the IPA, however that particular brew isn't my style.  I chose the 312 Urban Wheat beer, and was pleased overall.  As the pub was unusually slow, I had plenty of time to savor my beer and talk to the bartender about all of the upsets in college football that day!  He was also very knowledgeable on the beers and happy to let me taste a couple of them before I picked the 312.   I'd be happy to come back to the Pub another time for more beer, and to try the food!"}
{"text":"Besides the food being good, the service of the waitress we were given was absolutely terrible. We literally have been in the place for over 2 hours only checked on once. Had to get up to go ask for a water, nearly went to the bar to get our drinks because this waitress clearly doesnt do anything. We had to stand up to find her to ask for our check. Then she messed up the split. Took an additional 30 mins to correct it.... we only ordered 3 things. Literally watched her stand staring off into nothing at the register for 25 minutes not doing shit.   Dont get me wrong, i saw a very attentive waitress hurrying around the restuaraunt helping MANY more tables than the woman who had ours and she was doing fabulous. My experience here wouldve been much better if we had her. I probably will special request a waitress worth a damn if i do come back."}
{"text":"the food was great. had higher hopes for a chicago type atmosphere. took my husband to celebrate his birthday tonight and had the worst experience. as a local that had moved from chicago hoped for a friendly experience. was told that i couldn't bring a cake which i understand. but was told there was desserts. absolutely nothing in the menu for them. also. it took forever for the waitresses to bring out food. as well as if we asked for anything else like ranch they \"forgot\" i couldn't even tell you how many times the waitress told us she forgot tonight. sad part is. it wasn't busy at all, and to have different waitresses coming to our tables. as if it was a competition they spent more time gossiping then actually serving their tables. :/ and then they made us feel like we went an inconvenience and we were a table of 8. but there was obviously a reason as to why there were so many available seats in the place. there were even irritated when we asked for them to turn on the blackhawks game."}
{"text":"Great tv's for games...awful food & service! We realized there is no \"fresh\" food coming out of their kitchen.....the waitresses walk down to another location to get your food....so our food was cold! Service was awful....had to get up to ask for refills & they did more socializing with one another than helping customers...."}
{"text":"Would love to give his place a little better rating but there are three things from preventing me from doing so.  1. When my husband and I first walked it it took a couple minutes for the girls standing around the bar to simply acknowledge our presence. Once they did, the first one to walk up said we could \"sit wherever we like.\" There was an issue with this as the only two empty tables were stacked high with dirty dishes. She made no attempt to say \"oh we'll clean that for you.\"  2. The wait staff that took forever just to stay hello was standing around the bar doing nothing while one waitress ran around the entire seating area trying to clean and meet with guests.  3. The beer selection is mediocre at best. Which I partially understand because they only serve Goose Island.   With that said the food was actually pretty decent and I did enjoy the wheat style beer I did have. Overall a not horrible choice to have a bite and beer."}
{"text":"Ok,  the beer was so awesome I still have to give them 5 stars EVEN THOUGH I CANT GET IT ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!!      I'm mad at you goose island.  Your other beers are available in many places.  MAKE MORE BOURBON COUNTY.  We need it!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was not greeted or told to sit wherever. Eventually just sat down.. and waited. And waited. They were not busy at all and there were a few employees standing around. Drinks took a while to get to the table, the food was eh.. good but not amazing. The menu seemed much smaller than the one posted on their website. But the real downer for me was that they charged my card THREE times. When I called for the manager, the staff was reluctant to hand the phone over. Once I did get the manager, she was snotty and kept talking over me and wouldn't listen. Didn't even apologize. I filed a claim with my bank right after calling them.   I would not recommend. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The beer was good, but my order of fish and chips, was terrible.  We were the only party in the entire restaurant when we walked in around 2:00 pm on Saturday and I think that the fish from my order was either reheated from an earlier time or was just old and not fresh. The fish was a light grey color, chewy and very pretty nasty.  I used to love the original Goose Island in Chicago, and as a local in LV, I was not pleased with this experience and don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Dylan at the goose island bar was absolutely amazing! He was friendly and extremely awesome to talk too! He really made our experience at the goose island bar and hard rock hotel a memorable one we won't forget!"}
{"text":"2 servers on a Saturday night? Place is packed and the table next to us just waited 15 more mins additional than us when we all ordered drinks at the same time. Food took a while to come out. Sorry Hard Rock, your service sucks."}
{"text":"Came here not too long ago & had a great experience! Mady made me feel extremely welcomed & interested in how her customers Vegas experiences were going! I would totally come back to goose island if she's bar tending! I also loved the \"wasted taters!\""}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Goose Island Brewery, I've been to the Chicago location and had a lovely time. I enjoy their beer and have purchased Goose Island brand beer from my supermarket from time to time. I also very much enjoy the Hard Rock Casino and other restaurants inside of the casino such as Culinary Dropout and 35 Steaks + Martinis. So I was quite surprised by the poor service and trash food at Goose Island.   If you must go, I suggest only ordering beer and sitting at the bar. It will probably be a less disappointing experience this way.   The bartenders and waitstaff spend more time socializing with each other than making sure their customers are satisfied. I saw several customers get up from their tables to walk over to the staff who were gathered around the hostess podium to request service. My party waited for additional items that were ordered for so long, we followed suit and did the same.   A member of my party was having a discussion with someone from the waitstaff when the bartender walked over and became hostile with my colleague without even inquiring about what the issue was.   The staff here has a \"customer is always wrong and they can go fuck themselves\" mentality. And the food tastes of freezer burn.   The staff is doing a disservice to the Goose Island brand. I would advise you to get a few comped beers from the casino instead, and if you're hungry, head to Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"Horrible drinks. Horrible food selection. Rude staff. Judged me by my skin color when I walked in and told me to leave because I didn't order fast enough. Snooty waitresses who feel working at a bar is a top notch career, enough to look down on educated and career having individuals.   Don't judge by skin color because we could've bought everything on the menu.   Your loss!"}
{"text":"This place looks inviting. But don't let it fool you. The service was poor. We walked in they looked at us and said sit anywhere you want. And then they never bothered to come take our order. What is up with that? So then we went to the bar to order a drink the bartender was too busy talking with someone to take our order. So about 5 to 10 minutes later we finally got a beer and sat down. But still no waitress. Despite the fact that they were standing around not doing anything. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Nice place to cap a hot day in Vegas.  Wanted a little cold beer and this was the perfect fit. Start with the $8 flight, you can't go wrong with a little of this and a little of that to get some sampling in and make your decision.  Mady the bartender was super friendly and helpful. Nice place to unwind, eat some good food and a cold beer.  We even went back the next day and she made us a killer Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"Jake is the greatest bartender. Love that guy. Service is outstanding. Food and drinks are amazing. Jake really knows his beers"}
{"text":"Small-ish pub in the Hard Rock Hotel. Service was very good but the video poker ate all my money. They comped my  Belvedere and soda since the machine robbed me."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go there if my meal was free, The staff was so rude, that is if they talk to you and acknowledge you in the first place."}
{"text":"The Goose Island Beer Company pub inside Hard Rock Hotel is a great new space featuring a variety of Goose brews plus tasty pub fare.  Pricing is fair and the ambiance is quite nice.  There is gaming on the bartop.  My server was friendly and knowledgeable.  She was attentive throughout the visit.  The food was solid but nothing really worthy of a special trip.  The best aspect of this pub is the availability of Goose Island's incredible Bourbon County Brand Stout, including Rare BCBS.  This sweet nectar is so unbelievably complex and delicious.  Pretty empty on this Saturday afternoon...  Will be interesting to see how they do, especially with Pub 365 opening at Tuscany Suites & Casino plus all of the spots on the Strip."}
{"text":"Corn Beef is killer!  Originally went there to see how large their Goose Island selection was.  I left knowing this is the only place I will go for that sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Goose Island because I was exhausted, hungry, and didn't want to leave the HRH. Came in and was greeted by 2 different waitresses. Sat where I pleased.  Ordered chicken quesadilla and the flight. The flight took forever to come out and each glass was poured from the tap differently. Also, they were mislabeled. I know what the IPA is supposed to taste like and it's not supposed to taste fruity like summer ale. Forgiven. The quesadillas were actually really good (for Tex Mex). The guac that came with it was pretty good.  Overall service was a little shaky and slow but I was too tired to deal with it. Meh, I got my food and drink from them. I did try to ask if I could buy more booze from them to take to my room since they were closing and got a non-answer. Their loss. I got my answer from another HRH bartender in the casino (go to the gift shop, they sell cheaper bottles)."}
{"text":"$6 beer can't beat that deal! It's located  Inside The Hard Rock and across from The Joint. Friendly staff. I didn't grab a bite because I just wanted to kill time before the concert."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Hard Rock Casino while in Vegas. This was my first stop after I arrived from the airport. I had the Goose Island IPA (they don't do drafts before 5 pm) in a bottle and I ordered the Italian beef and cheese fries. I like Goose Island beer so the beer was great and I loved my fries! The service was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I plan to come back and get a flight before I go back home."}
{"text":"Beer selection is okay. We enjoyed 312 Urban Wheat the best.   Horrible service though. Two workers standing at the bar area just stared at us as my husband and I walked in. When we asked about their beer, Lolita, she bluntly said \"sour\" with no explanation. We ended up getting food elsewhere after our finishing our flight."}
{"text":"Just opened 3 weeks ago. Serving 6 month old Goose Island IPAs. I'm not joking, I was given a \"fresh\" The Illinois\" bottle with over half a year of age on it in a 3 week old pub. The Green Line APA I was served from draft also tasted old. (For those that don't know, American style IPAs get their distinctive flavor from hops, and that flavor diminishes with age. For optimum flavor an IPA should be served with no more than 2-3 months of age on it... Old IPAs exhibit flavors of cardboard (oxidation) and unbalanced caramel and toffee from the malts. With American style IPAs, the  fresher the better.)  Food is decent, but, a bit pricey for Las Vegas. Like most things at the Hard Rock, the space and the staff are attractive, and service is friendly. However, knowledge of their main product (beer) was sadly lacking. Any non-beer items require the waitstaff to leave the pub, as there is no kitchen in the pub itself.  For the beer geeks: The only reason to come here is if you want to try Goose Island Bourbon County Rare and are willing to pay the $100 per bottle price. Otherwise this place is a pass. There are much better beer destinations in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We were excited to give this new pub a try...and we were not disappointed!  The beer flight was perfect, amazing beer, you've got to try it!  The service was just as stellar.  Friendly fast service...a fun place to catch a game and unwind.  We will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for lunch to try their items.  We ordered:  Chicago style pizza dip Bacon and beer nuts Roast pork sandwich Sweet Italian beef sandwich Green chili pork Poutine  Meeting at noon, the Goose Island Pub was empty save for two other patrons.  All sandwiches were shared between us.  I also ordered an iced tea which was refilled frequently.  Starting with the bacon and beer nuts and the Chicago style pizza dip, I found the beer nuts nice and spicy with small pieces of bacon mixed in.  The beer nuts were quite spicy.  The pizza dip is a different way of having pizza without getting a pie.  It's served with pieces of garlic crust and you spoon the dip onto the crust with some giardiniera (if you want) and it's quite good.  All three of the sandwiches had good flavors and the breads were soft and good.  The green chili pork sandwich was on a kaiser roll and had a fried egg.  Finally, I have to mention the poutine.  This is the only place in Las Vegas to get authentic poutine.  It was the first time I had tasted real poutine and it was quite good.    Service was very good.  The place was very quiet.  I'm not sure if the Hard Rock's clientele were all interested in going to the pools but I sure saw a bunch of scantily clad ladies heading that way.  Chef Bradley Manchester has come up with a limited menu of good sandwiches and snacks.  This is a great place for getting a quick sandwich and a beer."}
{"text":"Ok, this is quite sad.  I love staying at the Hard Rock.  Some great places to eat, like Culinary Dropout. Generally great service, even in the Mr. Lucky dinner. Unfortunately, Goose Island does not even come close.  Ther kitchen is not some secret haven of culinary expertise, they  actually run the food through the casino by hand from Mr. Lucky Diner so you are getting diner food.  There was one waitress serving a whopping 9 people at 4 tables and it took us 20 minutes to get a beer. She never came back to ask if we wanted another, or how was our food or drinks?  I'll give her a break as she did have to run through the casino to get food, but really, the place this slow and bad service?  I can't even imagine what would happen on a busy night.  This was a Thursday between 8 and 9, maybe the reason the place was so empty was the food and service?  The beer gets mixed reviews. I always liked the Goose Island IPA, as  it did not disappoint.  My wife had the Seasons Ale and it was quite good.  I did get a sampler and was not excited about the English Bitters that was not bitter, the Green ale that was a lot like the non-bitters and a Belgian style beer that didn't have the complexity and nose that we have come to love in a great Belgium.  In short, there are better places to go in a town filled with great food, great service and great beer, I'd search them out instead."}
{"text":"Beer is good, the food was okay but it's not prepared in house. The food is actually prepared elsewhere and walked through the casino. The worst thing about this place is the service. There really isn't any. Our 'server', Desiree, was terrible.  Long waits, never checked to see how we were doing and we had to wait close to 30 minutes before we had to go ask for a to go box and our check.  The only reason I gave this place two stars is that the food wasn't horrible but to be honest, there are better places at the HR to eat. Actually, I would walk across the street and go to a freestanding establishment. There are much better restaurants and extremely better service elsewhere. Will not be back or recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great service sucks! Oh and the beer is good as well. You get what you pay here for the food. But our waitress, she didn't pay any attention to us. We waited for a long time to order food and she never came to check up on us. I had to go to her at her register to ask for another beer because she kept talking to her co worker."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a while. Lovw Goose Island beer and can rarely find it around town. It was good, but didn't  have the Blackhawks game on the TV! A Chicago bar and didn't even have a Chicago team on their TV's. I'll come back for the beer though!"}
{"text":"Food was meh and the service was AWFUL. Our waitress literally disappeared for 15 min and by the time she re-appeared to take our order the kitchen had closed. The only good thing about this place is that the beer flights are pretty reasonably priced ($8 for four 4oz pours) and Goose Island in general makes good beer."}
{"text":"First, I have to give them props for accommodating our group that started with about 10 people, but grew to 20.    Located in the Hard Rock hotel casino, our group decided to eat together and Goose Island pushed tables together for our large group. Good beer selection, limited wine, but full bar.   Servers had quite a time trying to keep up with the drinks. Our server seemed overwhelmed, but others stepped in to help.   As for food, they make it somewhere else and carry it to the restaurant.   Spicy Italian sandwich? Average and bread didn't taste fresh Buffalo fries? Soggy and covered in sauce Antipasto salad? Good and huge (I shared)  We had a great time time, but given the size of our party, food was subpar and servers seemed a bit grouchy."}
{"text":"Being a Cubs fan & once living in Chicago I was excited to see that the Hard Rock added Goose. The beers were good but the service was awful. Our waitress, a 50+ y/o trying to look 20, was not attentive & acted as though she didn't even want to be there.  I know they are a newer establishment so maybe the \"wrinkles\" will get ironed out but until then be aware that you will be waiting a while so take your time."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after discovering HR had microbrews, it was a nice little find. We sat at the bar and were tended to almost immediately. With drinks already in mind, the wife ordered a bloody mary and I opted for their seasonal which was a winter style ale. I prefer stouts but this ale was easy to drink and had good flavor. The bartender was very generous with the pour for the mary, which was nice. When you pay big hotel prices for drinks we are grateful of generous pours. Bar staff were friendly and checked on us often, so no issues there. But we did notice a few of the dining room wait staff obviously slacking off. We only stayed for 1 drink before lunch so we left shortly after our only round. No reason we wouldn't go back again for another round and maybe play some shuffleboard too. The only issue we ran into was access to the parking, its a bit confusing and difficult to get in and out of the property depending on which way you are coming and going from."}
{"text":"Goose Island Pub is the ideal spot to watch the game, grab a brew and that's about it. You can chose for a long list of Goose Island beers but food option is very limited and somewhat unappealing. The options are the usual greasy finger food available at the bar. French fries, cheese curds, chicken tenders, etc.   We end up ordering the chicken tenders with a side of BBQ sauce. Thank god for the BBQ sauce because the chicken tenders quality was equivalent to the quality of a Hungry Man TV dinner entree. The batter and the meat was tough. Usually anything that's deep fried is edible in my book. Boy, not this time.   The upside of the pub is the abundance of televisions. You can honestly watch all sports at once. We were tuned in to a NBA game and 3 MLB games at the same time. There's no need to argue about what game to tune in to. You can watch them all. I'll recommend coming here for a cold one and to catch a sports game. Perhaps skip the food and try one of the restaurants close by."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here before a concert. The service and food quality was pretty good. Dominique got my g/f a replacement drink after the first one was not made to her liking. I got the bacon cheeseburger and my girlfriend got an ahi kale salad. Good for the price."}
{"text":"Not much in the way of service. You have to flag them down. Gumbo soup was pretty mediocre. Poutine fries were decent but more fries than curds. Hostess ignored the people standing at the entrance and they went away."}
{"text":"Really bad service when in an empty restaurant on a football Sunday. Waited 35 min for a drink, and after eating waiting45 min to get the bill"}
{"text":"*DISCLAIMER: I am not a beer drinker  This is beer lovers dream, if they like IPAs they're in for a treat. The place itself is pretty small lots of TVs so great to watch sports.  We came here after my job and sadly there was NO HH. Other than that we got jalapeño poppers which were a bit pricey and also loaded tater tots, the tots weren't so bad but the cheese was a bit too much. The jalapeño pallets weren't bad and you get a ton for the price.  The drinks were pretty good I was able to get the Stella cider that I liked.  My boyfriend totally enjoyed the Matilda and other IPAs.   The service itself was not bad the server was very friend and pretty quick with our drinks and food.  All in all I say try it and if you like beer you'll definitely enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"LOVE it! Very similar looking to the real goose island pub in Chicago. Food is great, beer is good- what else could we ask for except for a tour and a tasting?"}
{"text":"Loved this place, reminded me of being back home in Chi.  Pizza dip is amazing.  Bartenders were great, went twice on my trip to Vegas.  5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Great service, food, and music!  We tried shrimp po boy, fish and chips, bacon cheese burger, and corn beef sandwich. All were Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Well... if you like beer and you like hanging at the Hard Rock Hotel then you must try the Goose Island Pub.  This place is legit and the bartenders are cool  as hell.  Jake served us the beers we already knew about and introduced us to some newbies too.  Very happy with our experience..."}

Founded by John Hall in 1988 and growing the brand out of a small Chicago brewery into an empire of Pubs spanning seven cities including Las Vegas as of June 2016, one could say that Goose Island was one of the first American Craft Beer manufacturers to really strike it big, the 3,500 square foot location inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino playing host to two for lunch during the first Saturday of College Football in 2017.  Formerly home to The Ainsworth, a shadowy Sports Lounge across from Vinyl that had never seemed particularly hospitable, Goose Island Pub picks up where the former tenant left off by retaining its dual ports of entry but by opening one up and redecorating with blonde woods, better lights and more televisions the space instantly feels more welcoming, a recent tweak by Hard Rock Executive Chef Bradley Manchester seeing the space ditch Pretzels, Pizzas and Tots in favor of a menu built around the Windy City and several classic American Sandwiches.  Not especially fond of Beer and dining with a total teetotaler, the obvious focus thus on Food and the scene with a particularly brisk Iced Tea refreshing palates between bites, it was after greetings from a well-inked Bartender soon joined by a blonde female server in short-shorts that the menu was perused, the eventual order including a half-dozen items including three Sandwiches with everything sent out at a leisurely pace across three courses.  Largely familiar with the company and its first BrewPub, a favorite of family during their time in Chicago though the food had never technically been tasted, it was with Oregon State playing across several Televisions while the Yankees occupied others that conversation carried on beneath Rock music, the first round featuring a metal bucket of Crispy Bacon and Peanuts with a Spicy Maple Glaze alongside thin slices of garlicky Pita and a skillet of stewed Tomatoes, Pepperoni, Basil and bubbling Mozzarella.  Not the sort of place to cut corners, the spicy Giardiniera, Sweet & Sour Peppers, Pico de Gallo and Buns all made in-house daily, it was with the last few bites of Relish finished off that two sandwiches arrived in white wrapping, the presentation doing no justice to the package's actual contents as both the juicy roast Beef and Pork were as good as what one will find in Chicago or Philadelphia, the former served with plenty of Peppers on a toasted Hoagie capable of standing up to its contents even after a dip in Jus while the later could make fans of Tommy DiNic's do a double take.  Equally presenting classics alongside novelties, platters of hand-cut Fries offered plain or with any number of toppings including Hot Sauce or Chili, it was a bit of a shock that the other man at the table stated he'd \"never had *real* Poutine\" when a platter slathered in melted Curds and rich Beef Gravy arrived, the bastardization of the dish largely due to the Québécoise themselves but Manchester's version true to the real thing while the Green  Chili Pork channeled the Southwest with tender roasted Butt spiced up by Cayenne and Black Peppers even before the smoky Green stuff was added along with Pepper Jack, Onions and Tomatoes plus a Sunny-Side Egg on a fluffy Kaiser Roll.  ***1/2:  Thus far not really capturing the hearts of Las Vegans or Tourists, the fact that much of the Hard Rock's clientele comes from Los Angeles as opposed to Chicago at least partly at play, Goose Island is a very strong entry amongst the city's best places to catch a game, though in order to truly stand out the presentation of Sandwiches could stand to be a little more creative while game-sounds as opposed to music from the Casino floor would also be much appreciated."}
{"text":"This location in HR has never thrived.  It's the black hole of locations.  The business prior was great, just never worked I guess. Now it's Goose Island Pub, went in since my friend is a fan of the beer here.  Greeted as soon as we stepped in by a charismatic bar staff.  Clean interior, decorated nicely and we were the only ones inside! Has the place to ourselves. Loved that, however this place should've been packed! Will return next time I venture to the strip aka Hard Rock"}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews - our waitress, Crystal was awesome!  Service was spot-on, food was plentiful and delicious.  Recommend the fish and chips and warmed South Side Deli sandwich.  Spring for the  $2 charge for the onion ring upgrade - well worth it!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped in to watch the VGK game yesterday, there was a larger group of people having some sort of meeting in the main dining area. The bar back had us seat ourselves so we chose a corner table in the same area. After sitting there for about 10-15 minutes with no acknowledgement we decided to just wait in the bar line to order drinks since the waitress had a large group and was really busy. After waiting in line, with several people behind us, we placed our order. The bartender asked if we were with that group, when we said no, he VERY rudely said \"well why are you sitting in that area then\" followed by telling us that even though we were first in line, he was going to serve the 4 people behind us because the large group was his priority. We went back to our seat with nothing accomplished and 10 more minutes wasted. After we sat down, random people from said large group approached us offering to order for us because they couldn't believe how the bartender just handled the situation and treated us. Shortly after, the waitress came and apologized as well. After a quick discussion between my friends and I, we abruptly left without spending a dime and took our business elsewhere. Nice way to treat locals, dude! My friends and I will be sure to continue to spend our money literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is awful. Done up Vegas chicks with horrible attitudes and no help with menu or drink selections. The food is really good and the beer is good as always so that's the only reason for a decent rating."}
{"text":"Having looked at the photos of Goose Island Pub and also a fan of the beer. Unfortunately, the service wasn't welcoming and I'm not sure I will be coming back to this pub anytime soon. No matter how good that Chicago Style Pizza dip was.  The space was empty when we walked in, and when we asked if the venue was closed, the bartender said no but seemed to clearly not want our business. He just wasn't friendly and everything we asked for seemed to be met with a little frustration. We were even asked to move, as paying customers, off the gaming at the bar because there were other guests that wanted to use the machines. Not sure if that is a casino rule that i didn't know about, but it seemed weird and a little insulting.  The beer was delicious, the food was a dream, the service though... You lost me on this one Goose."}
{"text":"Exactly the kind of spot we were looking for to watch the Super Bowl.  The vibe was lively but not obnoxious, and the two ladies here were on their toes the entire time--quick and super sweet (great service!); wings & tenders were good bar food & the beer flight we got was solid (We also got help from our servers to choose our beer).  After a crazy weekend in Vegas I needed some coffee, which they didn't have, but they actually ran next door to get me some! Thanks gals!"}
{"text":"Really like this concept of craft brew at the Hard Rock! And a gaming bar to boot! Replacing the Ainsworth, GIP offers 8 draft choices as well as bottles of Goose Island's brews!  I've been here a few times, and sat at the bar to enjoy some video poker along with my GI draft. Service was great, and the place was pretty mellow every time. The dining area wasn't very busy, and at most there were 3 other people at the bar. Oktoberfest is now on draft, and I recommend this one for sure. Drafts are $6 or $8, and a flight of 4 samples is $8.  They also have Large Format Vintage Ales for $50 and a variety of specialty brews. I've not tried the food and based on the reviews so far, would be hesitant to do so. Unless it was at the bar, where at least you can't be that easily ignored."}
{"text":"Before a recent concert we ended up for for dinner and a quick drink. The food is very decently priced and the food is very good. I tried a pork sandwich and it was large enough to share between two people.   Service was consistent and friendly."}
{"text":"This place got great potential. The smell of barley is in the air. Enjoyed trying the Rare Bourbon Country Brand Stout. So many beers so little time. Recommend trying the Spruce Goose Tasting Flight for $8. You get 4 ounces of four different tap beers of your choice.This place will be one of the top beer bars in Las Vegas. Great food and great service."}
