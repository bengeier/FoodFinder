{"text":"Went to the bar section with an Entertainment Guide coupon.  Got a steak sandwich, and a pizza, but since it was Monday we got 2 pizzas for the price of 1. So really we got two free pizzas. The steak sandwich was good: properly cooked rare, with a good grill char on the outside.  Fries were just fine.  The pizza on the other hand was disappointing, appearing to be made with a low quality premade disk with no risen crust edge...with small bales of meat, and the golden cheese covering, it could be mistaken for a Saskatchewan diarama.

The service was excellent though (an older gentleman who's obviously made a career of it), so if you're there, eat, but stick to something that gets grilled."}
{"text":"We ate here twice on Air Canada's dime (they overbooked) Last night we were in the bar and my wife & I both had fish and chips. The fish was heavily breaded and there was very little actual fish, the fish was mushy as if it was frozen and the tarter sauce was the worst I have ever had. The chips weren't bad. Beer selection was mediocre. I had a lite IPA (there is such a thing?) and it tasted like any old lager. Had a whiskey neat and the portion was very skimpy.
This morning we had breakfast in the restaurant. I ordered the steak & eggs and my wife ordered French Toast. My medium rare steak was pretty good but closer to medium in my opinion. My two eggs over medium were a different story. The yokes on a over medium should be liquid with solid whites. My yokes were mostly solid depriving me of anything to mop up with the toast. We had to ask for butter that should have been brought before the meal. 

Summary: The food is mediocre at best, service is OK. If you are staying here and have your car I suggest eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was here today with a colleague for a working lunch. They have a set menu as well as a buffet. Now first I should tell you that I didnt even know that this place existed - this entire place - there is a hotel and restaurant. 
I cant speak to the hotel room standards but the restaurant was nice.  The restaurant itself is decorated in dark woods and warm tones. The buffet that was set up was impeccably clean, but not huge.  It was definitely an asian themed buffet which is kind of strange as there is no sense in any other way that this is an asian inspired restaurant. 
The buffet consisted of noodles, ginger beef, pork, vegetables, salads, desserts etc... If you are looking for a killer buffet this is not it. However if you are looking for a nice buffet with limited selections at a good price ($9.99) you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Holy cow did this buffet go downhill.  I remember years back when the hotel was still a Greenwood Inns property, the lunch buffet was around $12 and would give you multiple items to choose from.

We walked in and the place had maybe 3 or 4 tables occupied.  The \"buffet\" if you can even call it that consisted of spaghetti and meatballs, some grilled vegetable medley and chicken soup.  The pasta looked terrible and was sticking to the chaffing dish.  The meatballs, well they were meatballs.  One look at the sorry, sad selection and we were out of there.

I'm never going back here again."}
