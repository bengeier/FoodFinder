{"text":"Pretty decent hot pot! We went a couple days ago with some friends and ordered the all you can eat special. We got a TON of food and the quality across the board was quite high. We ordered lamb slices, beef, pork, ox tongue, oyster, mussels, cuttlefish, squid, beef balls, fish balls, shrimp, salmon, tofu, udon noodles, spam, hot dogs, taro, spinach, nappa, mushrooms, and a fresh lobster which was STILL moving when it arrived.   We ended up staying for 2.5 hrs and almost devoured all the stuff we ordered. Service was decent, we had to ask the waiter a couple times for one of the ingredients we wanted, but ultimately he delivered.   The total was about $30 pp but for the quality, I would recommend."}
{"text":"I had diarrhea the whole night after having dinner there. The food are poor in quality, no special sauce and have limited choices. Will definitely not return again."}
{"text":"HIPOT Hot Pot just opened recently.. \"also named as TOA HERN.. I think it is the same as the Dows Noodles place.  Had my first experience there, decor was nice and spacious.. i would say that would be the only good thing about this restaurant.   Service was horrible. When you go in, the menu is confusing.. Basically there are two menus.. one without seafood and one with seafood.. different pricing.. pretty fair right? Then you realize.. the seafood one comes with bo jai rice and some special noodle which the regular menu doesnt... these things dont worth a dime so you can see how cheap the owner/management is.   This is not the best part yet... you have to pay $0.50 for an EGG!!!!!! AND they give you ONE FREE CUP of drink.. and after that it is $1 for one cup $3 for a small jar and $5 for a big jar!!! This restaurant is SOOOOO ridiculously cheap.. they might as well start charging for soy sauce.. Whereas 100 degree and KAM DOU nearby are just about the same, WAY MORE flexible and better value.. 100 degree gives you unlimited drinks.. yes, it is diluted but at least they are not stingy like that and they give you all the sides to mix your own sauce and eggs without charging that extra dollar or what.   Then I dont know if it was the woman owner but you always get the impression that she wants you to leave and asking you if you are done and wouldnt want you to order... when THERE IS NOONE WAITING... and also when you do order, she would leave out a few dishes...   Overall, i find service is really poor... I do not like how they make everything \"extra\" when it shouldn't be...  Yes, place is clean, food is normal.. but everywhere else is too.. So i would definitely not recommend this place and just go to 100 degree is you want clean and good food and variety and kam doa if you want cheap hotpot..   I think they should realize for that extra buck or two, they leave a bad impression to the customers.. i rather you include the cost in the meal."}
{"text":"Love this hot pot place, they have the widest variety of high quality seafoods,meats, etc. Make sure you have a reservation or else you'd be waiting hours to get in for dinner. They offer dessert too thats also higher quality than many hot pot restaurants in the GTA. This place is a bit of a distance to drive to but still worth the money. !"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. It's expensive compared to other hot pot places in the area. $60 for 2 people! Where as the hot pot place at Times Square is $40.  Their soup is packed with MSG. I was so thirsty. Drinks aren't free, so that's how they make some of their money - thirsty customers - I saw lots of people drinking beer. I bought a coke.  Not a lot of choice for sauce either. You get some garlic, chilli peppers, soy sauce, and green onions. Other hot pot places give you a lot more choice for sauces. No egg yolk either if you are into that.  The beef was good, if it wasn't I would have been seriously unhappy. That was the only highlight.  There isn't a lot of seafood options either, so save your money , not worth the extra $$$ . Also you can order premium angus beef for an extra $2, I felt insulted because does that mean the regular beef is low grade?  I also wasn't impressed with the way the staff cleaned the tables, space is tight, and when the staff clean the tables they spray bleach - some aren't careful and end up spraying the tables beside THAT HAVE FOOD. WTF. SMH. I don't feel like seeing bleach sprayed on to my food."}
{"text":"We visited Hipot a couple weeks ago ... mediocre food to say the least. Service is quite unpleasant, they can definitely be more polite. Servings are small, much smaller than other hot pot places we visited. As per price, get ready to be charged an arm and leg especially on weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"I used to dine at this place a lot until I found lots of flies in my soup.  We were group of 4 people so we had two seperate pots with 2 soup bases in each pot and the flies were founded in ALL 4 soup bases. We spoke to the server and was told that they were from the vegetables.  I tried to take a picture and the women seems like a owner of the place took the pot away from our table. Never going back again."}
{"text":"All you can eat angus beef for an extra 2 bucks, absolutely amazing! Service is alright, but they usually only have like 2-3 people working even when its packed Food comes pretty fast and good quality"}
{"text":"Service: well mannered servers, accommodating, speed was good (they're nice for people who bring in their own cakes.  Main course: all items on menu was in stock, however their portions are small compared to most other places for the lower price and quality (I would say 100 Degree at 7 and Leslie is slightly better in value). The seafood is fresh (first time I had a lobster still moving). The one time enoki mushrooms was lame (you only get it with the seafood upgrade), I know they cost a lot but com'on economy of scale, you can deffos afford to give more than one measly portion. Greens sucked, just overly aged/tough. The meat is really good, the AAA beef was good, but magically my 2nd order never arrived (asked them to follow up but I guess it was too expensive too), and the place was half empty.   Beverages: Everything costs money, thiis is the first AYCE place I've been to that charges the Plum Juice by the jar $6.00 or $1.50 per cup (you get 1 free cup to start). Its ok for me, as I never drink till the end of my meal, but the rest of my party was not as thrilled.  Desserts: They have Mango Pudding or Gwai Ling Goh (rare find)  Washroom: Clean when not busy (1 toilet stall in mens room), but floor was full of debris, feels like they mop but don't bother sweeping.   Stingy places like this should not be doing AYCE"}
{"text":"worst hot pot place ever! service and attitude of the servers was terrible. Soup base was awful and they even tried to charge us 15% extra to cut the birthday cake there..wtf? Stay away from this place!!! not worth the money at all!!"}
{"text":"I came here after a long venture from Mississauga to attend the TD Night Market (it didn't go so well).  I heard from a friend that this hot pot restaurant was very good and pretty cheap (it is not), so I thought why not.  I found the waiter to be a little rude, but we came pretty late at night (12 am) and I could understand if he was tired.   They had an AYCE portion of the menu where you could order as much as you want with no extra charge (we were charged by number of people), and all of it was pretty good, but nothing really stood out.  The beef was very good.  However, everything else tasted a bit bland, and I found the soup base a bit plain as well.   The ambiance was very modern and casual, so coming with the family was perfect.  However, they should've showed us how to work the temp. controls as we didn't know which controlled what.  The restaurant was generally very clean, and sanitary.   Prices were certainly not 'that' cheap, I can't remember, but I think it was between $20-$30 each person and a few extra charges for some seafood dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant has moved a few times but still with the quality.  When you go in, you can smell the hot pot. Because the previous restaurant is not a hot pot place, that's why the ventilation seems not exceptional good for all the steams from the hot pots.    I have never seen in a hot pot restaurant that the beef is so high quality.  The meat and fat are evenly blended together.  When you order, I notice the beef dishes that come is always one less than what you order.  May be it is the way to control the waste of food.  It may also be due to the beef is more expensive.  I usually order what I like in the first round, see if I am full before ordering something different for a second round.  For hotpot, the final result is that you are always more full than expected.  Remember to order not just the food item but the quantity required.  Otherwise, every dish is for all the people on the table.  Sometimes I will let the waiter know that it is a trial dish and only a few slices will be more than enough.  In that case, there is no waste of food and you can try more.  The fish ball, beef tenderloin ball, wonton, squid ball seems like home made and are very good.  On weekend, you can add $2.99 for a seafood plate.  It includes half lobster that is not written on the menu.  This is the only seafood plate for the night.  For $1.50 you can add a pot of rice or pots of different flavor rice.  An extra $0.50 for additional drink.  Only 1 dessert for each person.  Dated back few years ago, everything is included.  These are the food inflation in theses few years."}
{"text":"On a cold night, the steamy glass of the restaurant reminded me of an R-Rated scene from Titanic.  You know, when her hand smudged the steamed glass.  Once I stepped inside, the place looked and smelled like a Hotpot heaven, misty and aromatic.  Snap Judgement:  All was good, all was swell.  From the spicy broth (my favorite), the freshness of everything on the menu and the attentiveness of staff.    Do try:   Crispy deep fried fish skin, give that baby a quick dip in spicy broth and chomp on it.  This proves that deep fried anything rules!  And try the Chicken wings that have been marinated in wine.  You know that rule of chicken skin is bad?  Last night I threw away that silly rule.  It may look like a \"plain chick\" raw.  But after a few minutes in a hot bath, \"plain chick\" became \"hot chick.\"  One word, scrumptious!  Tips:  Go early & hungry and carry with you a lot of patience, even with a reservation we had to wait 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Not that I\"m in the mood to write bad reviews today, but Hi-Pot was an extremely underwhelming experience.   I've taken into account that AYCE hot pot places are known for food never arriving and slow service, but this place had all those attributes PLUS:  1. Toughest Beef ever 2. No drinks (just tap water). No refills on pop or plum juice (one complimentary) 3. My luncheon meat never showed up after three separate orders 4. Lack of sauce options (I like the sauce tray offered at 100 Degrees much better) 5. Hard to find parking in the plaza 6. Must reiterate the slow slow service  I prefer 100 Degrees over HiPot any day. 100 Degrees opens till 5AM too!   This place will be added to my Stay Away List!"}
{"text":"Hi, Hipot.  It's me again.  You know, the girl who's here basically every 2-3 weeks, occupying your table space with a pot of ma la spicy broth?  Yeah, that's the one.  Is it because I think you're the best hot pot around?  Not necessarily, but you're fair for the price.  Service can range from pretty good to almost surly at times, though mostly OK.    Food/freshness quality is decent.  Beef is occasionally tough and gamey but usually is fine, with the luck of the draw that you might get a particularly fatty-marbled beef plate.  Vegetables are fresh, without any/many yellowed veggies. Nice that the raw eggs are cold to the touch, which makes me trust them more with food safety knowing they haven't been lying around at room temp for ages.  Important stuff to note:  Cash only.  Make resos if you come on a weekend.  Any soups aside from plain broth are extra (~$4), which now seem to be pennies after trying spots at soups more than twice that cost.  Hi again soon, Hipot."}
{"text":"Would like to give 0 star but that's not an option. Service was the only redeeming thing this place has to offer. The food they bring to the table is of such poor quality that I would be embarrassed to feed my guests, and to think these people charge $66 for two people for such a sad display of stale, freezer-burned meats, and semi-rotting veggies.  The place was dead on a friday evening should have been a red flag. My bad for staying..."}
{"text":"I grew up eating hot pot my entire life. Usually at home when there was a big family gathering or something like that. It  wasn't until my teenage years before discovered all you can eat hot pot.   Due to the fact that hot pot holds a memorable part of my child hood, my expectations for any place like this is rather high. After I've tried countless locations that serve this genre of food, I must say, hipot; or previously known as Dow's noodles. Does it the best. Sure, I agree with other reviewers saying service may be lacking or can be rude. In my opinion this shouldn't be relevant when eating this style of food. As long as they bring me what I want what more can I ask for. Besides there's already a tone of ppl crowding around the little pot there really isn't much room more the servers to provide any service aside from dropping the food off.  They can be pricey relative to its competitors, charging extra for everything. But hey you can't argue there food quality is pretty good.  One of the many few places that gives me that satisfying feeling when I walk out the door after a long evening of carnivorous hot pottinggg"}
{"text":"This place used to be the best hot pot location my wife and I go.  Over the years services have gone significantly down hill and I normally don't write reviews but this last visit completely turned it into a memorable bad experience where we will never go there again.  Beef and among many of the items were not fresh.  Services was terrible - we've requested follow up on our small pot of rice and they've indicated it takes some time and 44 minutes into the meal we did not end up with the food.  We had to request on our food follow up three times and food did not end up showing.  We ended up not finishing our meal and left. My wife felt like throwing up after coming home.  Over all unacceptable service, food isn't fresh, and price went up along with a lot of additional charges for different type of soup base.   We now have to search for another hot pot place to go to after many years with Hipot, its unfortunate but it simply would cut it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is meh. Nothing special but it is really busy on weekends. If you're a couple waiting for a table, you may be asked to eat beside strangers at a connecting table. A little awkward if you're looking to have a private conversation with your friends, partner or family.   Nothing memorable about this place. I believe late evenings, there's a cheaper price."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for hot pot and unlike most of the others scattered across the GTA, this one is pretty clean and the food is put together per order rather than cafeteria style grab and go like \"Little Lamb\".  The food here is pretty standard, but the cuts of meat are a lot more fresh than other hot pot places around town.  The catch however, is there are a lot of surcharges for extra things on the menu, such as certain types of meat, seafood and plum juice.  Just make sure you ask the waiter before ordering what is included in your meal.  Overall the food was great and the service is relatively quick.  They give you some stuff to mix your sauces with, but you have to keep asking for more as it's rarely enough for the whole group.  I prefer the cafeteria set up like \"Little Lamb\" better as it's just quicker and easier to get what you want.  I would come back here again, but it's not my first choice for hot pot in the area."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to hot pot place 5-10 years ago (in its old location at times square). I finally decided to come back to check it out. I rarely go out for hotpot anymore because I usually get all the hot pot food myself and hotpot at home.  We went here for late night. Man, it's so much more expensive than before (I forgot whether it was 15.99 + 2 for weekend or 15.99 for weekend)! (Sep2015 edit: late night is $18 per person!)  Anyway, the food was as expected. Good variety. I'm mostly a lamb and beef person, but I was surprised to find their beef tendon balls to be so good!  I'd come back here again, but like I said before, I usually just get all the food myself and just hotpot at home. I'd probably come back more often if it's a bit cheaper.  7/10 for the food, 7/10 for the service, 7/10 for the value. 7/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Watch out this place is cash only!  The service is not the best we went with the all you can eat menu. You have to ask for everything. These guys are so cheap.... please bring more veggies.  The dessert is included, but you have to ask for it  Come guys don't be so cheap!   I would not come back at all !"}
{"text":"terrible service    prices to expensive , $ 28   but total bill come  $ 38.50 no lobster no extra order  ( they said hotpot buffet but they change extra $3 for soup)  never come back"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The meat is not fresh. The beef looks like it has been staying out for weeks with patches of dark spots already appearing on them.  Vegetables are dry and yellow.  Service is mediocre and slow.  I would give this place a 2 stars but my gf insisted that it deserves a 1. I'm used to dirty ghetto hotpots but my gf does not share the same opinion. She wins."}
{"text":"Oops, I came here a couple months ago and forgot to review.  The food here was fine, but nothing special. Service was friendly and they had a decent selection.   The only glitch was that their credit card machine was broken that day. Other than that, meh, it was fine, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.. I've been to many other hotpot restaurants before and I must admit that this hotpot restaurant has the worst service. This place is also expensive too. I got charged an additional $4 for leaving one piece of uncooked salmon. I already paid extra to get the seafood platter. Why did I need to pay extra for not finishing it...? Avoid this restaurant and go to other hotpot restos nearby."}
{"text":"so.. What to say, what to say.... I went here on a Saturday night BAD idea, waited in line for 1 hour to get a 2 person seat, service was ok, had to keep repeating what i order because the staff kept forgetting to bring things like: rice, sauce, green tea... Ect...  Next an hour after eating my friend found a small bug.. yes I said it a small bug beside our pot crawling, I killed it with the menu but keeps eating but my friend she would not eat  at all.. I did like there meat but was not to pleased about the quality of the restaurant :( don't think I am going to hi pot anytime soon..."}
{"text":"I took my wife and 3 kids to this place this afternoon for a family dinner. The place is 70% empty. We were seated at a corner table which is not bad, until the server, a middle age lady came to our table, and such a rush and inpatient, rude is a little overstated, but it's annoying why she is having an attitude towards her guests...fine... Let's see the food... We actually found the meat were served even before we finished ordering, but the other orders were partially missing and the server didn't even placed in the first place (pretend to be) when we checked after. The lamb was not nearly fresh so we mistakenly thought was pork, the beef isn't impressive and we didn't even finish half... Like in many other reviews, there are lots of things you need to pay extra to get...and my wife was reminded rudely one time about an item that has extra charge on... that really pissed off... The food come with small sizes compare to other places but big cuts. but it is fine for us as none of us eats a lot. I picked a original soup pot and it's really a pit of boiling water with a few slices cabbage on, this cannot be called soup or I am outdated... The final bill for our family is $150 after I convinced my wife leave 10% tip (it says included in the bill already in some of the reviews, but we didn't check so not sure if we doubled tipped). Overall, not a pleasant place to go, neither the food nor the service I can talk about, and it's pricy for what we had. Not recommending."}
{"text":"Went here with friends after work. Popular spot, almost packed for the 7 PM seating on a Tuesday! Many choices for items from vegetables to meats etc. They do try to up sell their seafood combo with Lobster etc. but I'd skip it, rather have my lobster in a more specialized place.  Overall selection is good, some of the soup bases are downright yummy like the Satay base which has just the right amount of spices. Service was also quite good, we didn't experience being ignored etc. that was mentioned in some of the other reviews and got regular soup water top ups without any prompting from us.  I was a bit concerned with the temperature they keep their meats at, I prefer the places where the meat is kept frozen until consumption.  Overall an A-OK experience and definitely not the \"disaster\" I was expecting based on so many low reviews previously; That said, there are better options out there albeit with a 10 minute car ride.  Bonus: Washroom was clean and stocked up with paper towels."}
{"text":"In the world of Greater Toronto Hot Pot, Hipot has a place on my list of Hot Pot Restaurants. It had a place at the prior location at Commerce Gate and now it continues to an extend for different reasons. I'm not saying it's the place to be but I was here almost alone near 1 am on an Elite night if not for my Friend WWmama.   My friend was joking that she can camp out at the car for the night since there's Yoga in the morning at the neighbouring Yoga Tree which is so conveniently located here. The closest comparison to this NEW location new redecoration Hipot is the known 'Made in China'. That would be my bases for most of this review.   SWEET:   -Hipot has LCD showing Cantonese shows which is a standard tradition when having Hot Pot at home while enjoying Hot Pot.   -Quality of ingredients, especially the Fatty Beef Slices for both rounds came and had great marbling and defrosted enough compared to others.   -Beef/Fish/Squid/Pork Balls are all hand-made while the Wonton had full size Shrimps within with a good bite.   -The seating is more roomy and spacious which gives more room for Patrons and Staff plenty of space to manoeuvre without troubles or accidents.   -Dessert included a reasonable sized Herbal Jelly that had as much flavour as some Chinese Dessert Specialty Shops.   SOUR:   -It's a bit more PRICEY than 'Made in China' since additional Beverages are extra cost while it's competitor has unlimited refill.   -Doesn't have variety of Sauces to choose from since it's only BBQ sauce, Soya Sauce, Garlic, Green Onion and Green Chili.   -Doesn't have the Sofa-like Booth seating that 'Made in China' has but even over there it's hard to come by at times.   -Staff have slightly less enthusiasm and are more mature. Service was still acceptable but less above and beyond than other places.   SUMMARY:   I wouldn't mind going back this Winter. Will definitely test if their 3rd round Beef is just as good quality as the 2nd round. I will report back once I find out!"}
{"text":"This is my go to hot pot place, likely probably not everyone's favourite due to the up and down service you might get.  But it's an AYCE place so I'm not expecting much to begin with.  Why I choose to come here every couple weeks is because the menu is extensive and the beef is by far the best out of all the other AYCE hot pot places around.  It's a high quality cut of beef unlike the low grade cuts the other places give you.  The place is generally clean and the seafood is usually fresh which says a lot vs some of the competition in the area.  But for a night out for some good hot pot, I can reliably come here and enjoy myself."}
{"text":"This place is quite popular in R.Hill so come off hours if you don't want to wait.  I like this hot pot place because they give you a large table even for just 2 people so you can spread out all your stuff. As well ventilation seems to be pretty good although at some points in the dinner it seemed like all the steam was going straight into my face.  You can get plenty full on the basic combo which has a good assortment of meats (beef, pork, beef tongue, chicken) but you can also go all out and get the seafood one as well which has lobster which you can boil yourself!  I noticed some reviews saying the beef wasn't that great but on my visit the beef was quite good and looked fresh although some were frozen a tad.   Service prompt but don't expect a smile as they're super busy and tired I'm assuming."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Overall good food. - Servers were accommodating. - I like how spacious and clean-looking the restaurant was.  - Good variety for food and soup base.  - Sesame sauce was really good!  - The utensils were clean which is something that is becoming increasingly rare for Chinese restaurants.   Cons: - Cash only. - Not enough variety for sauces.  - Prices were a bit steep - at $23 - and they charged you extra if you ordered different sauces other than the ones they gave you. - I didn't like the weird sour herbal drink they've provided us but it was nice of them to give us drinks other than water."}
{"text":"Came for some late night hot pot on the  coldest night this winter. Believe it was around $22 pp after 10 pm. The menu is like their dinner however, most of their items were all 'finished' by the time we ordered. Not much of a big selection, especially if they didn't have most items we wanted but I guess that was expected. The quality of the meats were okay, not the best... I enjoyed the lamb though. The wontons and beef balls weren't as good as advertised, I honestly think the packaged ones you can buy from the grocery store are better. The chive dumplings were tasty. The service was pretty good for a late Saturday night that was somewhat busy. Our water was always refilled and they came to check up on us periodically. Overall I think the quality was subpar, and wasn't worth the $22 especially for late night. They did have complimentary dessert of either Mango Pudding, which I found to be one the worst I had but I can't complain, Herbal Jelly or Warm Egg Custard (Which I wanted to try but they didn't have). I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here since it opened. The food is good but missing a few item we ordered. The service is very good. I like the idea you get your own hotpot also.  The only downside is you have to pay If you want more plum juice. Either $1.50 a glass or $6 a jug. You can't take it home if you don't finish which I think it's wrong since we have to pay separately. Another downside which will stop me from coming is they do t accept credit card. Any restaurant that can easily go over $100 don't accept credit card is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"What defines the perfect hot pot dinner? Is it the hot, boiling soup with all its aroma of spices? Is it the fresh ingredients laid out on the table waiting to be cooked and eaten? Or perhaps it is the tasty but addicting MSG added into the soup? Amidst all the restaurants in Richmond Hill, here lies yonder Hipot Hotpot. A hidden gem, which serves food of extravagant flavor and price affordable to all. Hipot Hotpot combines everything extraordinary of a perfect hotpot dinner and creates food-orgasms in your mouth.   During my latest venture on a cold night, me and my friends arrived hungry, expecting a satisfying dinner.  Despite reserving a table the previous night, we waited for twenty minutes. After we were seated, we quickly ordered our food, soup base, and drinks. The satay soup and clear parley soup arrived steaming hot and the smell/aroma was amazing. For the first wave of orders, we selected: udon, sliced beef, water cress, lettuce, and many other ingredients. Along with the ingredients ordered, we ordered the seafood special that included lobster, fish noodles and other seafood ingredients (ask waiter/waitress for more details). The first wave arrived quickly and disappeared slowly, as we cooked and ate it all. As we started ordering more, the service slowed from hungry customers ordering their food (a reasonable wait). Our orders were often lost and we would order again. Despite the poor service, when the ingredients arrived, the food tasted amazing.   Before arriving at Hipot, book a reservation ahead to avoid the long wait for a table. The restaurant will be packed on the weekends.  The phone number is provided at the top of the Hipot Yelp page or the Official Hipot website (http://hipot.ca/). Heed my warning or patiently wait for a table.  The décor is pretty but is nothing special. The dining room is has minimal space and in a packed restaurant, Hipot can be very overcrowded. The washrooms are clean according to my standards and the eating utensils are sanitized (Forgive my abundant descriptiveness)  Hipot Hot Pot exceeds my standards of hot pot. After visiting other hot pot restaurants, Hipot is the place to go. With tasty food and delicious soup, who can deny it without trying it. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who is out looking for a hotpot restaurant to try. P.S Although this update review is the same as before with more detail, I want to provide the most up-to-date experience.  Update: I edited the review, mostly grammatical and restructuring sentences."}
{"text":"Located just west of Times Square, across from Ten Ren's, with just enough parking space for visitors. The parking spaces are rather small which may be a tight fit for SUV drivers.   The restaurant is large and spacious, with around 20 tables. Ventilation seems to be quite sufficient but there were only about 6 or 7 tables eating when I visited on Tuesday night. Washroom facilities were clean and tidy. Tables were spacious.  Half a lobster per adult if you order the seafood hotpot package. The soup base is tasty - we tried the Satay, clear broth, and Mala soup bases. Meats were fresh and sliced thinly, the beef was worth noting (AAA Canadian beef). Good selection of vegetables and house-made pork/beef/squid balls, although they used to be even better back in the day. There was complementary plum juice but only one glass per person. The seafood package comes with shrimp, oyster, enoki mushrooms, salmon, fish paste noodles but you can't get seconds. For dessert, we had a choice of tortoise jelly, mango pudding, and egg pudding (choose the egg pudding!)  The price is steeper than other all you can eat places. The bill came to be around $170 for 5 people after tax and mandatory 10% tip. Good place to try if you're looking to have hotpot with family but I can't see myself coming here that often due to the price alone."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this hot pot place.  I passed by it many times but this is my first time trying it.  I went for late night hot pot (starts at 10pm) which is now $18 per person.  They advertise AAA beef which is nice.  The food was good quality, they have quail eggs which is my favourite.  For some reason there is no thousand year old egg in my soup base which is strange since it is advertised on the menu.  Maybe they ran out.  The soup was quite salty.  Overall service was good, seating wasn't a problem.  Comes with dessert mango pudding or egg custard (warm).  It does not come with free plum juice though, only included for dinner."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people gave this place such a good rating. You have to pay extra for everything ie: hot pot rice, seconds for the plum drink.  There aren't that much selections and the food was just okay.  Has any of you tried 100 degrees hotpot restaurant? Same price and there are more selections and drink refill is free and free pot of rice."}
{"text":"I think their \"flaw\" was updating the decor of the restaurant. When they were at a different location, the place was smaller, looked and felt unsanitary, way more congested, server gave worst service EVER, and people were still flocking to it. Now that it looks classy and with three times more space and looking spiffy, people expect to pay less and have service like they are at a five-star hotel restaurant!? They don't do hidden charges as everything are clearly marked on their oversized menu, and staffs are as helpful as they can be. We first ordered the \"AAA Angus Beef\" set (which is their basic set) for the three of us, and as \"food\" arrived, my wife noticed the lobster a few tables over, and asked the server if we could add a lobster, as our friends don't want one. He said, no problem, but reminded us that it would be cheaper if we upgrade to the seafood one and he had no problem doing that; however, since upgrade require all of us to upgrade (makes total sense) and we can't finish the extra half lobster, we decline his offer and just went for our choice. Throughout our evening, I've noticed a few times when other patrons made...unreasonable \"complain\", their servers and owner remained friendly and professional. For a Chinese restaurant, I'd say they are above average. Just a word of advice, I suggest sticking with the basic soup base, as you will only start with a premium base, but as the night go, they will refill with water, so, your premium will be watered down as you go. Beside, their three basic soup base are good enough already. As for the greens, I've noticed people have complained them being not fresh, well, it's a hit and miss. We reordered greens three times, and each time they come with different quality (one time the lettuce came washed but not fully separated from the core, but I LOVED it because I love eating the core), but they're always washed (at least for all the visits I've made to the current location, can't say the same thing to their former location). I laughed when I read that someone thought they \"recycle food\". I've yet to see them doing it once, as they always pile dirty dishes with leftover food at the end of the meals. They would need a lot of costly labour to extract those food. I HAVE seen, however, they charged extra to people who ordered WAY more than they consumed (which was clearly marked on their menu). That USUALLY wouldn't happen, as they've done a good job controlling your orders with how much of each item you order that they bring. Okay, food quality. The lobster that we ordered, it was worth every penny....I mean nickel....as they were fresh and sizable (standard size for extra order or part of the seafood set). Their meat balls (beef, squid, or lamb we had all of them) were excellent. Their \"AAA Angus Beef\" were good quality. Now, before people complaining about discolouration of the beef close to the bottom...I'm guessing they don't cook beef at home. It is normal for the centre of a pile to do that after sitting for even a short period of time, especially for shaved or minced meat, nothing to be alarmed about. Now that the weather is cold again, I can expecting to hear my wife requesting to return. Oh, BTW, she refused to go to any of the other \"major competitors\" as she finds experiences to those places sub par, both with food and services."}

{"text":"DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE! So many other hot pot options! Not unless I wanna pay a gazillion surcharge for extra stuff!  Came here for my dads birthday dinner tonight, it was suppose to be a happy dinner but left us with a bitter taste! I had suggested this place knowing it as the best hot pot place in GTA! Or WAS the best until tonight! Haven't been here in ages! Saw an advertisement so I called to book and asked about their buy 6 get one free promo I read! They say yes it's still being offered but it's only valid from Mon-Thrs! So I can get it today (being Tuesday) the guy says yes so off we go, a party of 7pax! When we got there not only did he say we need to print off a coupon! On the phone he never mentioned anything any about a printing a coupon! Who does paper coupon anymore? Even groupon is electronic!! Let alone the gig on the phone did not mention anything about a coupon! False advertisement!! Worse is he goes and storms to another table and whips out their paper and flings it in our faces! What kinda attitude is that???? This day and age, this kinda poor customer service is totally UNACCEPTABLE! No wonder the place is half empty!   Then he goes further to try and \"sell\" us on special Beef? Yet they claim to be the best in hotpot with the AAA Beef! So unless we wanna +$2 per person for special \"Angus beef\" +$5 per person for seafood! +$1.50 each for extra fish noodles tubes! The list goes on....I will NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN! Who sells upgrade beef in an AYCE hot pot place? Wagyu I can understand but Angus in a hot pot place?!? Can one really tell the difference?!?   They automatically add 10% service charge so it's no wonder they give u attitude!"}
{"text":"Giving out this review was pretty confusing because I could've went with 5 stars or went with 1 star.    Hipot was not very busy on a Sunday and reservations were not necessary. They have 2 menus - one is $26 and the other was $32? & an additional $2 for weekend.  The $32 menu included the other soups for free whereas the $26 one only had \"clear soup\" as free soup.   The menu is pretty extensive and also includes hot pot rice.  We did not get charged extra for the accompaniments for the sauces either.    I love love love love how you can adjust your own pot's temperature.    The food was delicious - the beef was amazing which is rare such as most beef in AYCE have been frozen and obviously tastes like the poor quality beef that it is. There were no bugs in the veggies which was huge for me - I've had too many little bugs turn up in my food in hot pot places x_x  I can also see how people hated the service here as I was not a fan at first.  But the service is quick, although quite absent-minded - I really think it depends on luck on who serves.  The younger guys run around trying to refill, clear plates, and pick up new orders - they do tend to forget my order esp for noodles.  No big - just ask them again.   PS. Do not order the hotpot rice - thumbs down.  Overall, I will come here again.  Not many AYCE places can make me forget how cranky and irritated I get when I overeat.  I ate so much here it felt like I grew a 6 month old baby when I walked out of the place."}
{"text":"My body has an innate sense of self preservation. It's cold out? Dayum, Angel, you need some HOTPOT!  This place has become a fast favourite, if I decide to eat out for hotpot. I get the extra $2 for AYCE angus beef, and make sure to pack in those pounds of beef. The menus come in all English, or all Chinese. The tables are laid with the usual sauces already, but you can request the extras too (peanut sauce, egg, etc.)   The service is not bad at all, I never felt like I was waving my hand around to get someone's attention.  One bad thing, different from other hot pot places, is that the drinks are not AYCD. You get ONE drink, and if you want more, you pay for a jug more. *shrug* I guess that's how they make rent!   Overall, I'm a fan. It's cold now, I'm hungry, I want hotpot that's not at home? Boom, I'll see you at Hipot."}
{"text":"I have not been to any AYCE hot pot for ages!! I do have an A-OK experience at Hipot Hot Pot Restaurant.  Love the hours they are open.... yes till 2 AM! Great to have a midnight snack after Karaoke, Clubbing and Elite Event...  For the after hours there are 2 menus for you to choose from Beef ($12.95) or Seafood ($14.95).   The Beef selections only have the plain chicken soup as a spicy loving person in order to upgrade one of the soup based to satay there is a surcharges of $4. The Seafood selections give you 3 soup based to choose from and have a platter of shrimps, oyster, mussels and enoki mushrooms.  The Satay Soup base is pretty good, has a lot of flavours and a strong taste of satay. Cannot comment on the Thousand year old eggs with parsley soup base since I did not have any.  The food wise I found them quite fresh.. nothing were frozen solid and all have good presentation. The 2 oysters were sizable. The thing I love are the freshly made meatballs.. not those one that from the package,  There is also 3 desserts to choose, we opt for Herbal Jello and Mango Pudding both taste A-OK.  The only thing is you only allow 1 glass of sour plum drink.. if you want tea there is an extra $1.50 charge...   Maybe since we come late at night and the restaurant was not busy at all, Me and my clothes did not smell like Satay or I been cooking in the kitchen the whole night.   The service here is cold and efficient. 10% tips has been added to the bills automatically so make sure you don't double tipped!"}
{"text":"Over $40 a person on Saturday.  Place was filled and only 3 waiters.  Meat was tough or frozen when it came to the table. Wooden chopsticks. Did not like the spicy soup base, it was neither Sichuan or Mongolian or anything ..looked like a random mess.  Ordering is annoying and outdated... Pencil and paper pad.  Lost many orders and took quite long to arrive, naturally."}
