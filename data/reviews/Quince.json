{"text":"My wife and I go to Quince regularly. All food is prepared from scratch and is always excellent.  My wife has a gluten allergy and they adapt many items to address that. The menu changes seasonally and the presentation is excellent. All menu items are originals and creative.   The service is best in class and prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity served.   Stop in and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bitterballen cravings? Quince will satisfy them. It's a cozy and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"I know, Winterlicious isn't the best way to experience a restaurant, but the food here was really disappointing.  The steak was chewy and had an oddly gamy aftertaste (and when I ordered, the server didn't ask how I wanted it cooked--fortunately, it came out the way I would have ordered anyway) and the panna cotta tasted like Greek yogurt.    And even worse, it turns out that the same group I went with on Wednesday had visited the restaurant for Summerlicious in 2010 and none of us remembered.  (One of my friends said the place looked familiar, but we dismissed it because so many restaurants share that exposed brick, reclaimed wood, large windows aesthetic, but a search of my email when I got home revealed that we had indeed visited previously.  Not a good sign.)"}
{"text":"4/5! Been here twice and loved it both times! All the salads are amazing and the meats are perfectly done. I recommend the lamb or pork shoulder!"}
{"text":"Agh. I did not like the food here.   I really want to give it a higher rating, because the food *looked* good. And even the first few bites of things tasted alright. But everything went steadily downhill from the beginning.   Let me preface this review by saying I went during Winterlicious. And for the record, I'm probably going to avoid future Winterliciouses because of restaurants like this.   Anyhow. First. They forgot to bring us a bread basket.   I had butternut squash soup for an appetizer, which was okay but nothing interesting and no depth of flavour. It may have well came straight from a can.   Then, I had the grilled salmon on a bed of rapini. The portion size was really small. The rapini was nice, but the inner 2/3rds of the salmon was severely undercooked. And undercooked salmon is disgusting. The outside was nicely charred but the inside was almost cold.   To finish, I had the cheese plate. It was also a verrrrry small portion, and I wasn't a fan of either of the two cheeses.   My companion seemed to enjoy her food a bit more, but I had a few bites, and her pork loin main tasted underseasoned and her \"cookie and cakes\" dessert was so boring. It was like 4 small pieces of desserts that look like they came from a Metro grocery store platter.   So no, I definitely won't be coming back here. It's a shame too, because the inside of the restaurant looked really nice and cozy. But the food? Nope."}
{"text":"Had a great meal.    The service was extraordinary. The hostess welcomed us, hung our coats, sat us at the window table, and plugged in a little ceramic heater for our feet.  The server took the time to discuss the menu and answered our questions with knowledge and enthusiasm.    The lamb was incredible, and we had a bottle a Stratus wine.  We all acknowledged that the cork was soaked through and though we're not picky & didn't send it back, a comp would've been appreciated."}
{"text":"This is a really great neighbourhood restaurant.  Good size portions, tasty food, outstanding service - all in a lovely cozy venue.  Highly recommend Quince."}
{"text":"We recently held a private party for friends and family in their downstairs space!    The pre-planning, menu selection, working with the owners was outstanding!  The night of our event went perfectly!  The food was a hit with everyone!  The price of the bottled water was steep for the father-in-law... but you know!    If you are looking for a neighborhood restaurant be sure to check out Quince!  You guys are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday for Summerlicious dinner. I don't know if it is the day we went or what, but everyone here seems to be over 40. The interior and place itself is pretty cute.  The food was ok, nothing amazing but good enough.  The octopus carpaccio was nice and tender so that was pretty good.  Some dishes were misses like the grilled swordfish with orange and fennel. The swordfish was overcooked and way to sweet. It was also bland besides the overly sweet flavor.   The grilled skirt steak with broccolini was ok. There wasn't a nice crust on the steak, but it had a nice flavour and was not overcooked (it's pretty hard to make skirt steak not flavourful).   Dessert was meh, my husband had some brie and breamster and said it was good. I had  a brownie with ice cream and it was ok, the description of the dish on the menu sounded much more decadent than the actual dish which was kind of run of the mill.  The waiter was attentive only while taking orders. We tried to make eye contact with him to get us our check for over 20mins. Every time he walked by, we tried to politely grab his attention in vain.  Overall, too medicore in every aspect  to return on my own."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2012 - absolutely blown away by the food and the warm service. I had the beef speidini to start (on a bed of purple coleslaw), beef brisket for entree, and 5-year aged cheddar for dessert.   Never had a beef speidini before but will definitely have it again sometime in the future. Beef brisket was very nicely seasoned, really tender, and portion-wise, surprisingly hefty. It definitely filled me up. The cheese was fully bodied but not overwhelming. I asked the server to suggest a wine to go with my meal - she recommended a red wine that worked well with all three courses.   My friend had the escral salad, apple and pork, and the cheese as well. I thought the pork would be a bit dry, because it was a sizable chunk. But it was very nicely seasoned and not dry at all. It was on a bed of couscous which was ok (apple and pork was definitely the best part of the dish).   Service exceeded expectations. Servers were friendly. They provided additional cutlery when needed, asked us if we wanted any wine / coffee without seeming pushy. They took our coats and hung it up in the coatroom, got it back to us efficiently.   The restaurant had a very nice and relaxing atmosphere - candles on every table, but it was casual.   I'll definitely go back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  An inspiring meal at a reasonable price point. Our group of four had, Beef Tenderloin, Chicken Parmasean, Grouper and lobster chowder.  We shared our meals so we could all enjoy the different creations. All four of our selections were very good. The Chicken Parmasean was the simplest of the four dishes. The beef tenderloin had the best overall flavors.   I have been here about 7 times. Each time I visit I can't wait to go back.   I have even been there once just for soup and appetizers. A wonderful way to enjoy a selection of goodies that burst with flavor.  Be prepared to take some home. The portions are sometimes more than one can complete.  This restaurant closed in late 2012. Not due to food quality but most likely location."}
{"text":"Came with some friends for Winterlicous too. The House Cured Veal Carpaccio is the pick of the night. My friends were crazy for the Gnocchi, I had the Salmon, which was okay. Spiced pumpkin dessert nicely balaced the petite cake that accompanied it. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"This place is fine but has a few drawbacks so I wouldn't give it an especially favorable review, especially considering the level of prices.  1. The beer list is awful.  The craft brew movement is years old at this point.  Any restaurant in this price level should have one or two good craft beers.  2. The space has some nice architectural features but our table wasn't especially comfortable.  It's crowded without feeling lively, if that makes any sense.  3. Service was up and down.  They were personable and helpful, but it took them a long time to get around to asking us to order drinks, and then they vanished for extended periods a few times after that."}
{"text":"Good food, service and setting. Nice bit  of variety and fun (indonesian poutine!). My steak and frites was not awesome but very good. The poutine was a treat. My wife's linguine was loved by her but not so much for me. Wine selection is good (always irks to see the mark up in restaurants however). Service was prompt, friendly and genuine. Hoping to get in on the rijstaffel soon. A good choice."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for value, so when I found out I could get a 3-course meal for $25 (thanks to Summerlicious) I was up for trying this bistro.    There are only 2 or 3 tables on their \"patio\" (i.e. on the sidewalk) so we were stuck inside on this beautiful summer evening.  The inside, however, is beautiful.  Super tall ceilings, industrial design, reasonably spaced tables despite how narrow the space is.  I especially liked the chairs (they look like the Remy chair from Restoration Hardware), but some patrons found them uncomfortable.  They have different chairs in different sections of the restaurant, which I thought was creative and interesting.  If you're doing Summerlicious, it's imperative to peruse the menu before deciding on your destination.  I was sold on Quince the minute I read: Octopus Carpaccio, as an appetizer.  I was even able to overlook the fact that it was served with capers (on my questionably short list of \"dislikes\").  I never even knew this dish existed.  It was even better than I expected and impressed that it was an option, considering some of the other options were as mundane as soup or salad.  Choosing from the list of entr√©es was a challenge for me.  I usually prefer the shortened Summerlicious menus because I struggle with meal selection, but Quince offered 5 delicious options.  I'm used to a Summerlicious menu only offering 2 or 3 choices, and even then one of them is easily disqualified.  I was especially interested in the braised pork shoulder, grilled salmon or pappardelle with veal ragu.  However, the chicken or gnocchi options also seemed like good choices.  I went with the pork shoulder and my date decided on the salmon.  The portion was rather large, especially considering this was for Summerlicious.  I found the whole dish on the salty side, but the meat was so tender it fell apart any time I touched it.  I stole a bite of the salmon when my date wasn't looking, and it was also cooked to perfection.  The aioli sauce was a nice complement to the fish.  I was impressed.  And to top it all off, the $25 meal includes a dessert.  This was a no-brainer for me; the obvious choice is the lemon meringue pot au cr√®me with blueberry compote.  My date chose the chocolate walnut brownie, based on the waitress' recommendation.  The lemon meringue was a winner!  The high rating is mostly due to the value.  For $25 the quality and quantity of the food was outstanding.  The service was very friendly, but not necessarily attentive.  They forgot to give us bread when every other table around us already had their basket and, for some reason, our meals took a while, with no explanation.  I would like to try their regular menu some time."}
{"text":"A great menu and the best service I've had in a while. Food flew out of the kitchen, apps and the entrees.   App - Oatmeal crusted calamari, dried fruits & nuts, cranberry caramel teriyaki - $7  The oatmeal encrusted calamari was almost a dessert. It was cooked perfectly - most places overcook the squid. Not here. Tender and crispy. The sauce was ridiculous. Never had anything like it.  Entrees - Seafood Mac & cheese, lobster gnocchi, tomato vodka lobster cream $22   All spice Tuna with sweet potato gnocchi, butternut squash puree, seared pear and the cornmeal encrusted colossal scallop, and some more awesome stuff - $26  I had the seafood mac & cheese, which is a pretty simple description. It was really gnocchi, with baby scallops and shredded pieces of lobster in the sauce above. The sauce wasn't too heavy, which was good news because the gnocchi was hard to finish. The waiter came back to check on us after about 15 minutes, saw our empty plates and just says \"Whoa!\"  The tuna was huge and cooked perfect rare. And that scallop - hoh boy. My girlfriend really liked it and shared some - as I shared some of my meal with her. Ahh, food. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious and were underwhelmed by the food and service but impressed with the atmosphere.   Food:  Sub par.  House Cured Veal Carpaccio - The distinct flavours you would have expected from this were lacking. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was also incredibly small.  Beef Poutine - A tiny portion of a real poutine with beef in the place of gravy. Again it wasn't bad but just sort of boring with no real flavour.  Braised Lamb Shoulder - This was pretty good. The lamb fell apart at the touch of a fork but there wasn't much too it. Just lamb on mash. The meat was tender but the meal itself boring.  \"Pork and Beans\" - This was essentially cassoulet, but lacked seasoning. The flavour was predominantly beans, which we can all agree are quite bland.  Chocolate bread pudding - This looks beautiful. Small elegant little piece of chocolate cake on a big plate with the sauces and berries elegantly placed on the plate. It looked like it was going to be divinely decadent. It wasn't. It reminded me a bit of a sponge...in texture and flavour.  Spiced Pumpkin Pot au Cr√®me caramelized apples and pistachio - This wasn't bad. Tasted like pumpkin pie filling but presented in a creme brulee dish. The apple taste was no where to be found.  Wine - 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva Porta Chile - Excellent Full Bodied Wine   Service:   Sub par. Our server was really friendly and sweet but she was incredibly inattentive.   Some examples: Never asked us how our food was, just brought it and walked away. We managed to flag her down to get pepper for our meal. We flagged her down to get coffees to go with our dessert that had already been served. Never topped our wine glasses off. Chased her for our bill at the end of the night.   Atmosphere:   Great! The restaurant was busy but not too loud, the lighting was perfect, the decor was lovely, and it was cozy without being crowded.  If you don't care about food or service, this place is fabulous.   You should note that they have an additional room in the basement to sit tons of people and could easily accommodate a large party down there.  Overall an okay place but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"OK cool menu...it came up on Groupon so we decided to try it.... Nice wine selection.... then we ordered wedge salad and beet app... and bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and Pot Roast.... the waiter then came back after taking our order and asked if we were using a coupon or something...  So we gave him our Groupon... That kind of bugged us...we just didn't think it was appropriate that early on but whatever.  Then the salads came....mine was on a chipped plate and my husband salad had a huge discolored heel from the Romaine Lettuce still attached... Strike 2-3 depending on how you look at it.  Then the main course came out....the Beef Tenderloin was so small that my husband and I just laughed.  It was the size of a golf ball!   We've never seen anything like this...EVER.  The grease was all over the plate and you can tell that it had been sitting for awhile.  It was pretty messy.  The Pot was ok...odd presentation.  The potatoes with both dishes were very yummy!  strike 4 or 5....then the waiter brings our bill and explains since we used a Groupon they added 20% for tip!  What?? We love to tip... that they billed us--ticked us off.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"We went to Quince for the first time last year during Winterlicious 2014. We selected from their prix fixe dinner menu. Appetizers: chicken liver pate with mango chutney; butternut squash soup. Entree: wild boar ragout; beef brisket with mashed potatoes. Dessert: pumpkin almond torta; boutique selection of cheese. Overall, the dishes were tasty - highlights included the pate, brisket, and torta. The portions are also very well sized - you leave feeling satisfied. The servers are also very friendly, and the ambiance is perfect for just about any group and any occasion."}
{"text":"Rah!  You pay PAUL BUNYAN PRICES here, but get PAUL BUNYAN PORTIONS.  So it kind of works out.    I started out by ordering a coconut-crusted chicken salad with spinach, eggs, and pineapple.  Generally, coconut-crusted chicken is a disappointment - the coconut flakes off the chicken, creating two sad little piles of awesome that never quite touch - the Romeo and Juliet of foodstuffs.    In this case, though, they'd done a bang-up job.  The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly, and the crusty coconut wrapped around it to create a buttery coating that was absolutely delectable with every bite.  In addition, there was a soft-boiled egg with a yolk spread out over the spinach leaves, making this a kind of gooey, fattening heaven.    BUT IT WAS THE SIZE OF MY HEAD.   Seriously.  I like food, but you ever get an appetizer and go, \"Crap, is it too late to send back the main meal?\"  Because I had a steak a-comin', and here I was looking at this football-field-sized expanse of purest green, and the empty space inside my stomach was shrinking by the moment.   On the other side of the table, my wife and my friend MedKat were eating the remains of a wicker chair they had brought to the table.  No, really.  They said it was tasty, though.  The steak was a big disappointment.  I asked for medium rare, which in this place evidently means \"dead cow rare,\" and it was supposed to have bleu cheese on top.  It did, but when I hear \"bleu cheese on top,\" I don't think, \"a half-inch-sized chunk of unmelted bleu cheese.\"  I mean, I REALLY had to like bleu cheese, which I did, but this was a solid, imposing hunk that rode proudly atop the meat, like all those African women who balance jars of water on their heads.    Still, overall, we're looking forward to going back and trying it again.  What we had on the whole was good.    A couple of other odd notes:   * You have to ask for bread.  This is very strange behavior; I didn't realize bread rationing had started.  We did ask, however, and got cold bread - always a disappointment, but it came with a very yummy vinegar-and-oil dip.    * They will wrap anything in bacon here.  Seriously, about half the menu items were wrapped in bacon.  I half-expected to see the waitresses emerge wearing bacon wristbands and jewelry.    * The service, not to put too fine a point on it, sucked.  They were friendly, but we waited forever for our food.  On the other hand, we showed up without reservations on a night when they were preparing for a wedding, so I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this was an aberration, since they seemed very nice there."}
{"text":"Flavor overload!  I love experimenting with food so after taking a peek at the menu I was excited that this cuisine was not going to be status-quo.  The environment is cozy (small) and for a Saturday night was moderately busy (for its size). Our table waited longer than we expected for our main course, but after it arrived we noted that it probably takes longer than average for these amazingly complicated dishes to be prepared.    I agree with a previous review poster, come here to eat one treat - app, dinner or desert.  Do not combine (or your taste buds will explode! ok - not really, but you'll be really happy with me if you follow this advice)  Note: Do. Not. Take. Unadventurous folks here!"}
{"text":"Recently hit this rustic little Davisville spot for dinner. This was my second visit, having dined there about 3 years prior. My opinion was not changed on this second visit - not bad, but not anything special either. Service was pretty lacklustre, not sure if they were short-staffed or not, but it sure seemed that way. The food was just ok. With all the other spots in the city, a third visit is not warranted."}
{"text":"Why aren't there more reviews here?!    This place is great!  I've been here twice now for lunch, and both times I've left flabbergasted that such a great little place can be hidden away in Olmsted Falls.   The quality and creativity of the food rivals the best of any nice bistro or cafe you'd find in a big city like San Francisco or New York.     The food is extremely creative, and to my eye there are so many dishes and components of dishes that are all unique and freshly made--I don't know how their seemingly small kitchen can do it all.    The service has been very good both times we've gone.   And the second time we had a family party of 30 guests--and the waiters were able to keep everyone happy and the kitchen served up the orders mostly together.    I can't comment on dinner but they serve a mean, innovative lunch at a reasonable price.   When we return to Cleveland to visit family we definitely will be stopping at Quince!  I have some pics of the food I will try to post later."}
{"text":"Indonesian Rijsttafel (based review) - September 28th, 2011  Note:  I didn't have Mediterranian Bistro fare, so please refer to other reviews for Quince's daily norm.  Quince held a rare-find Indonesian Rijsttafel night in Toronto on September 28th, 2011.  Much appreciation(+0.5 star) for the owner to hold this Special Evening as part of his Dutch Heritage.  I didn't expect much of the atmosphere but on a night of full patrons the space livened up to it's Bistro potentials and the design showed it's eclectic beauty and grace easily matching any styles of Downtown Bistros.  As a sidenote, Toronto offers very little in terms of Indonesian food and the ones I've had I can't say I'm a complete fan of.  Now on to the Food(think Kaiseki servings) of the night....  On the Menu:  Indonesian Rijsttafel($55.00/person)  Sides/Condiments:    Atjar Tjampour, Seroundeng, Sate Sauce,Sambal Goran Ketang Kering, Roedjak Manis, Kroepoek Oedang, Sambal Badjak  As noted, some of these really helped to customize flavours on some otherwise bland Mains.  Favourite goes to Sambal Badjak(Fried Spiced Sambal Oelek) by a mile.  Mains/Sharing Plates:  Rempeh, Sate Ajam, Sambal Daging, Udang Rendang,  Sambal Goreng Telor, Sambal Ikan Tomat, Gado Gado, Rendang Pedang, Babi Pangang, Ajam Pedis, Sambal Goreng Boontjes, Nasi Goreng, Steamed Rice  Most dishes are not easily recognizable on first sight except for the Sate Ajam.  If not for the over-the-top friendly service patiently and enthusiasticly explaining each and every single dish to us, it would be a guessing game all night.  My Friend already had a huge ? mark on her head all day, lets give her a break this night.  :P  Mehs:  Udang Rendang, Sambal Daging, Rendang Pedang Interesting:  Rempeh, Nasi Goreng, Sambal Goreng Boontjes  Not all the dishes were mindblowing but at least I had a chance to experience and now I know my personal favourites going forward.  I was plenty full semi-belly busting while my Friend packed a good portion home.    This event was definitely worth it's weight in Sambal. We even got some Dutch Spekkoek(?) Cake to end our Meal. Let's do this again sometime."}
{"text":"Meh. Went to Quince once with some friends. The food way okay, but not amazing, and you don't get a lot of it for the price. In fact, we were seriously debating stopping in at the nearby Mandarin immediately after our meal...not a good sign.  I had the house-made chestnut fettuccine with a sort of balsamic sauce and a few different kinds of mushrooms. The fettuccine didn't taste like chestnut at all - it just tasted like whole wheat pasta. It was pretty good overall, but the portion was laughably small for $17. Noodles and mushrooms aren't exactly super pricey...give me more of them.  I also tried someone's gnocchi with lamb ragu. Again, it was okay, but it was basically just (mushy) gnocchi that had a sort of spaghetti sauce made with lamb instead of the usual beef. Meh.  All in all, my experience was okay, but not as awesome as I'd expected based on the prices. I don't see myself ever going back, unless it's during Summerlicious. Sigh...I can't wait for Summerlicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give 4 stars for this Winterliciious restaurant and here are the reasons: 1. Interior Design: fine, romantic restaurant with dim lights. Love their rustic wooden tables.  2. Service: Very prompt service. The waitress was very nice and knowledgable.  3. Food: I had Organic Baby Kale Salad, Roasted Pork Tenderloin and Olive Oil Cake, my husband had Octopus and Chorizo Salad, Potato Gnocchi and Milk Chocolate Pannacotta.  Both salads tasted great. I like my Roasted Pork Tenderlion better than the Potato Gnocchi . Though the waitress highly recommended the olive oil cake, we found the Milk Chocolate Pannacotta tasted more interesting."}
{"text":"My second trip to Quince, and I thought I'd be a little less conventional than is my usual.  Started with the mushroom tarte, a soft puff pastry shell, plein de melted taleggio cheese, roasted onions and mushrooms. Was to die for.  Shared the scallops with my wife, they were seared and also on a bed of du puy lentils and smoked bacon. I ordered the braised lamb shoulder which is a classic here. Served with cannelini beans and a mint salsa verde. Really excellent.  Sadly no room for the warm chocolate bread pudding.  Server Michael was attentive, but not overly so, and knowledgeable.  Atmosphere warm, dark and bistro-like. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"This reviews is actually based on several visits to Quince over the last few years.  The whole reason for being able to do a review like that is consistency.  Quince has consistently been serving us great meals with great service each and every time we go.  One of my favorite places to eat.  The menu is always changing and the specials are just too hard to not order especially when the servers can describe them as accurately as they do.  Their seafood meals are some of the best around.  The fish is always perfect no matter what the dish is.  The meatloaf is maybe the best meatloaf I've ever had, the pot roast is amazing, the \"little ears\" orecchiette pasta dishes are always awesome.  Get an appetizer while there too.  The dining room is a beautiful place and part of a nice little shopping center.  My only suggestion is changing the decor.  But who really cares about that when your serving dishes like they are.  Great stuff."}
{"text":"I went there for weekday lunch not so long ago.  We grabbed a patio table, and my friend and I both ordered the panini.  The food was tasty, the service was done efficiently and with a smile.  It was an enjoyable meal and I will most likely return for dinner to develop a better opinion."}
{"text":"Checked in today for a little winterlicious dinner with my cousin and aunt. It was pretty good :) t loved the octopus terrine with the miso coleslaw. The coleslaw was just the right acidity, especially well paired with the octopus. Definitely started off well! I then orders the duck confit for my main and I think it was good but could have been better :) it was a good serving sizes and I love the vegetables they paired with it. I'd say go for the fish instead though. My cousin had the mackerel which was very good!   The highlight of my trip was the dessert. I had their butterscotch banana budino toffee crunch. It was so so so good!! :) not too sweet and the banana flavor really came through. Not overwhelming but still extremely satisfying.  :)  The place was uniquely decorated. It was simple and the large mirrors make it seem more open and spacious than it really is. Very rustic feeling without making you feel out of place.   Service was excellent and fast. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. :) reading the other reviews, it seems to be a hit and miss, I'd say I definitely got a hit. :)  The only note is that you should be careful at the door. It's winter for my visit and the mats don't help you get up that little slope at the door. It's quite slippery!!"}
{"text":"quince, located in the Grand Pacific Junction shopping district of Olmsted Falls, brings a bit of food whimsy to the area.  The dining room has retained the slightly-colonial decor from previous restaurants, giving it an uncluttered but homey atmosphere.  The wine list is not extensive but does provide some good selections.    We started with the calimari in Thai sweet chili sauce with soba noodles.  The noodles were flash-fried and delivered in a stiff rectangle of what looked like a collapsed wicker chair.  They were a bit odd but quite tasty.  The spinach salad with coconut chicken was fantastic, but be warned: it's large enough to be a meal, and my husband had only a couple bites of his steak because he was so full from the salad.  I had the bacon and horseradish-wrapped pork, which arrived on an oblong platter almost two feet long. It was delicious, but at a crowded table the platter could become a bit awkward to negotiate.  The pork was accompanied by mashed potato balls that were fried crispy on the outside and sauteed onion and zucchini that formed the bed on which the pork medallions and potato balls rested.  It was all very good.  Another person in our party had the spinach gnocchi, which was homemade and quite delicious, the gnocchi had terrific texture and the sauce was very tasty.  My husband's steak was the most disappointing entre of the evening.  It came with a horseradish and bacon topping and bleu cheese - it was the strangest presentation of bleu cheese I'd ever seen, being a half-inch thick rectangle of sort of plunked on top of the steak like an afterthought.  The steak itself was very tasty, though.  The chef is apparently a big fan of bacon.  There are many bacon-wrapped choices on the menu, and the specials included at least one additional bacon-wrapped choice.  Now, I never regard bacon as a bad thing, but it's good to know the \"lay of the land.\"  The only ding I have is the speed at which food came out of the kitchen.  I have no idea what exactly was going on in the kitchen, but for a long time *nothing* came out of there, and then there were sudden spurts of dishes all coming out at once.  Everything was still hot and fresh when it arrived at our table, so it obviously wasn't just sitting on a sideboard, but we were a bit pressed for time.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and it was probably just a one-time thing, but I can't quite give it five stars under the circumstances.  Still, it was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great service at Quince.  Loved the food they served at summerlicious and I highly recommend this place:)"}
{"text":"I came here tonight for Winterlicious 2011 with a few of my friends.  I actually never heard of this restaurant before until Winterlicious.  We decided to try it out.  We made reservations at 6 PM, and we were quickly seated.  Quince was dimly-lit, a great little romantic feel to it.  Our waitress was very friendly and always came by to check on us.  I ordered the following: HOUSE CURED VEAL CARPACCIO:  I wasn't the biggest fan of it.  It was a bit too salty with the capers.  BRAISED LAMB SHOULDER: I was thoroughly impressed by this.  The lamb shoulder was soft and tender, and the lamb jus was amazing.  Not only this, the carrots were cooked to perfection.  CHILLED ARBORIO RICE PUDDING: The rice pudding was okay - the quince jam definitely gave it more kick and flavour, but it wasn't the best choice on the menu.  Considering that we had 8 people, we got to try a little bit of everybody's dishes.  For appetizers, I would say that the Traditional Dutch Green Split Pea Soup was the pick.  For entree: the Braised Lamb Shoulder and House Made Gnocchis were the winners.  Lastly, dessert: Spiced Pumpkin Pot au Creme."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night - ordered the charcuterie as a starter and their soup of the day. Soup was pureed tomato with fennel oil - intense with flavour but a bit salty. Bread basket was enjoyable with hummus dip. Mains were salmon which was cooked to medium at my request and extremely delicious as a result. My friend got the gnocchi which was also very good. Rapini was well seasoned. Dessert was the best course being the apple tart and the almond cake - the density and texture were perfect . Service was attentive and very accommodating. I would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"I recently came here with a group of colleagues for a private dinner, and overall it left more to be desired. The wait staff were very polite and attentive; however, the food was just adequate. While the remainder of the restaurant was empty for the majority of the night, we were in the basement for the dinner. The setup was unusual in that many of the guests were left with obstructed views of the presenter.  We were served appetizers consisting of bruschetta and satay dishes which were actually quite good. For the appetizer, we had a choice of a potato and parmesan soup or a salad. The salad, although being quite large for a serving size, was quite bitter. For the entree portion, we had the choice between gnocchi, a salmon dish or chicken breast. My colleagues commented that the gnocchi was quite good, although the accompanying brisket was overdone. My salmon was well done, however the accompanying peas and potatoes left more to be desired.   Many of us asked for dessert to go, as the night was getting quite late. The brownie was quite dry for both the dine-in and take-out options.   I have to say that a highlight of the night was the Stratus Cabernet wine that was served.  Overall, this was an average dining experience, but lacked the 'Mediterranean' dining experience that was expected."}
{"text":"An evening at the \"Moulin Rouge\"...sums up my visit at Quince. An assault on our senses.   Went to Quince this week for dinner with the hubby. Very cute area, the Grand Pacific Junction. Little shops with live trains that pass by...at least two during our dinner.   The evening at Moulin..I mean Quince began as we walked through the doors. The host that greeted us and the servers were an unusual bunch. Overall, very nice and accommodating but misfits of sorts. Lacked a level of formality and polish.   The decor of the restaurant is country with bad decorating sense. This was the biggest down fall for us. The wall art didn't fit with the country wall paper and light fixtures. Lighting wasn't dimmed and table lacked candles yet had some very modern glass sculpture on it. With the bright lights and bad decor, my senses were overwhelmed.   The food....the appetizers were ordered were creative and executed wonderfully. I must say that the \"appetizers\" were the size of an entree. Hubby had the sweet potato pierogis and I had the crab tater tots. The size, the creativity and the commitment to flavor was appreciated by us. On to the salads, again we had \"small\" dinner sized salads which were so large. I had the chopped salad and hubby had the wedge salad. Same thing, size, creativity and commitment to flavor was great. Entrees came out on dishes the size of serving platters. I had a veal dish with homemade ravioli. Veal was cooked perfectly, the ravioli was some of the best I had around and the lemon sauce was bold. My husband had the \"three little piggies\" which was three pork dishes on one platter. Size, creativity and commitment to flavor excellent. The only food aspect that was lacking was the dessert. We had a lemon tart with lemon ice cream. The lemon flavor was lacking and the tart was doughy and not crispy flaky like a tart should be. PS their homemade bread and basil dip was great.   Alluding to Moulin Rouge comes in because of the attack on my senses. The cast of characters, the location and decor, and the several courses we had with large portions and strong flavors just had me overwhelmed.   Kudos to the chef for such inventive, larger than life and flavorful dishes. Wish they would move to a space that fits the cuisine. Next time we go, I would choose an entree, savory every bite and stop there. No apps, no salads, no chance to mix too many flavors.  I was like a teenager who let loose on their parents liquor cabinet..mixing too much of a good thing made me feel a bit queasy."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Quince for a while and was very excited when it came up on Groupon. They are open 11:30 - 2 for lunch and then reopen at 5 for dinner.   I went for lunch and tried a few different things. First we had the Coconut chicken, spinach salad, orange ginger vinaigrette, brie, m√©lange of nuts & dried fruits. I am a huge fan of coconut and they had the perfect amount of coconut on the chicken (it was a breading) perfect to taste. The dressing was unique and a perfect compliment. Next we had the Quince grilled cheese. Two different small sandwiches came out with 2 different soups. Both unique and delicious!    Our server was very helpful and knew everything on the menu.  It is very small and cozy inside and I am excited to go back and try the new things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Really great value during Toronto's winterlicious and summerlicious promotions.  Their peanut-braised beef poutine (regular menu item) was one of the best things I've eaten this year. Excellent soups, satisfying mains, and a nice (polished and trendy, yet family-friendly), casual setting."}
{"text":"Cozy well-settled restaurant with very prompt service. Ambiance was perfect for our casual party however, the menu options were seemingly bland in contrast to the busy and upbeat environment. The dessert variety however was elaborate and simply perfect."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for the Yonge and Eg/Davisville area.  The food is all good. Everything i've had there has always blown my mind.  The lunch menu is so cheap for the quality i feel like i'm ripping the place off.   The dinner menu is also great. On their carrpacio, i love the addition of the deep fried capers.  Their dishes aren't simple - it's complex components coming together, yet gives you a simple feel to the dish that is not sophisticated - just bloody good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and been very pleased with my meal both times.  The first time I went was during Summerlicious in 2013, three-course prix fixe lunch for $25.  Three of us went together, ordered different items and were all satisfied with what we received especially for the price.  My partner and I went out tonight for their regular fare and between the two of us tried:  Chorizo and Crispy Potato (starter, $12) Grilled Pork Loin with brussels sprouts, poached apple, pickled mustard seed and red cabbage puree (entree, $22) Braised Lamb with wilted kale... and some other nice things, this was obviously my partner's dish (entree, $25)  Everything was great!  The portion of my entree was a little smaller, but the presentation was particularly beautiful and the combination of flavors was better than I expected when ordering it.    My partner was actually worried about me ordering the pork loin because \"red cabbage puree\" sounds pretty risky and I've been disappointed by strange vegetable purees at other restaurants... but I honestly think that might have been the best part of my plate!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"After becoming lazy and not making a reservation in Tremont as my wife and I planned, we found we could not get in anyplace out there so I yelped Olmsted Falls restaurants and Quince popped up. I would have never known it was there and it was tucked away behind the main road. The dining room was very tiny, perhaps 15 tables and 50 people tops on a busy night, but that is a great part of the ambiance. We were seated immediately and ordered cocktails, which were rushed out. We got an appetizer- the proscuitto and wild mushroom pizza, which was incredible- unlike any other flatbread I have had. We did feel a little rushed, as the waitress was very friendly, but kept coming back to take our dinner order, so finally we relented and felt guilty and ordered. FYI... if you want bread, you have to ask. Same with salad or soup, as they don't offer it to you with your dinner as is customary, even if it is a la carte.   Dinner consisted of Pad Thai for my wife, which consisted of chicken, shrimp, scallops and mushrooms on top of rice noodles with a mild peanut sauce. Not spicy at all, but tasty nonetheless. I chose the bacon wrapped meat loaf, which came with \"onion rings\", \"cheddar tater tots\" and \"BBQ\". The actual meat loaf was small, but thick and was very tender. The bacon was a nice touch and the BBQ was just a few drizzles of some type of Bar-B-Que sauce, which was tasty. I had no problem with the meat. The problem lied with the sides, which were such a small part that I can't really hold it against them, but teh onion rings were literally a circular raw onion with bread crumbs... like an onion ring looks like BEFORE You cook it... I almost wanted to ask if it was supposed to be cooked. Horrible and I love onions. The tator tots were exactly like you got back in grade school, only larger. There were 2 each onion rings and tater tots and the mention of cheddar tater tots was a mirage, because there wasn't even a hint of cheese.   The dessert menu sounded ok, and we tried the banana cheesecake and the chocolate cake, both of which were ehhh. Looked and sounded a lot better than they tasted.   Overall a very nice dinner that was very close to home. I will try them again and try a different menu item to see if it is simply another decent restaurant (at a little higher price than typical) or a cut above."}
{"text":"I wish I could give decimal ratings, because I would give Quince something between 3.5 and 3.75 stars.   I was impressed when I first stepped in by the decor and the atmosphere. It was very relaxed, tasteful and current. I was there for Summerlicious 2014 with a large party of 12 and we were all very happy with the menu. Usually, I find Summerlicious menus to be underwhelming and unimaginative. But Quince's menu was really great! Dinner was $35 for a 3 course meal and each course was superb, beginning to end. With drinks, each person's meal cost about $50 with tax and tip, which is more than I would spend on a typical dinner, but it really was yummy food and it was a special night with friends.  I took off 1 star because while the food was great, it was not the best meal I've ever had. I like to reserve 5 stars for a simply perfect meal that I dream about afterwards. If possible, I would take off another quarter to half star for less than great service. However, the manager of the restaurant did rectify the situation courteously and promptly, which my friends and I were very impressed with. She was the saving grace that earned this review a full 4 stars.   Overall, I would 100% recommend Quince for a nice meal in that area. Thumbs up and smiles from me!"}
{"text":"It's not someplace I would have gone on my own, but it was the site of a rehearsal dinner we attended.  The food was quite good, but it seemed to be trying a little too hard to be different or eclectic or whatever the buzzword is these days.  I had \"deconstructed lasagna\" which was basically a big bowl of (possibly homemade!) small noodles, tomato sauce, and lots and lots of cheese and roasted veggies.  He had some sort of chicken with a sweet crust and cornbread stuffing.  I think I got the better choice.  The salads were excellent, and the ginger ale was a source of constant interest; it came from the common soft-drink tap, and so always had a slight hint of the previous beverage dispensed."}
{"text":"I've been reading really good things about Quince for a long time so I was looking forward to finally visiting.  I'm happy to say that it was all that I'd hoped for and more.   We stopped in on a Tuesday evening, and entered to find a nearly empty dining room.  Once seated, our server took our drink orders and we set about the task of selecting just one of the entrees each.    The menu seems to be based on comfort food staples (meatloaf, mac & cheese, bbq, etc.) but from there, it's really taken to the next level in both flavor and presentation.    We finally decided on entrees (the bbq ribs/roast pork and the meatloaf) and after a reasonable wait, were brought two large plates of elegantly presented deliciousness.    I want to reiterate the size of these portions. I've been known to get cranky if the price to portion ratio is two far out of whack, in this case it was very evenly matched.  If you factor in the excellent quality of the food, the price begins to seem like a steal compared to the amount of food on the plates.   The food itself was excellent.  Everything on both of our plates was really good.  The meatloaf was moist and flavorful, and the bbq ribs and roasted pork were slathered in a thick sweet and spicy sauce that complemented everything else on the plate as well.   In some ways, Quince reminds me of another of my favorite place in the area, Wild Mango, in that the location and casual atmosphere belie what a truly great dining experience awaits those who visit.  I'd say it's worth going out of your way to check it out."}
{"text":"I love food! I love to eat! I love different experiences!  Quince's semi annual Indonesian Rijsttafel ($55/person) that I experienced on September 28th, 2001 was such a treat!  What is Rijsttafel? I even have problem pronouncing it.  It is a Dutch word that literally translates to \"rice table\", is an elaborate meal adapted by the Dutch from the Indonesian feast called nasi padang.*  Rijsttafels strive to feature an array of not only flavors and colors and degrees of spiciness but also textures, an aspect that is not commonly discussed in Western food. Such textures may include crispy, chewy, slippery, soft, hard, velvety, gelatinous, and runny.*  I was intrigued when I saw the menu. My Yelp Friend even taken back and asked the waiter if we need to choose from the given menu. Our friendly waiter just asked us to relax, no decisions need to be made as every single item list on the menu would be served to us!! That's what I call a feast!!! A food adventure!  So much food... a steady parade of little dishes were served to us the whole evening. Some are good, Some are so so, Some are meh. But it was the concept, the experience, the atmosphere I enjoyed here at Quince that made this evening memorable.  I was so overdosed with food by the 2nd round of the rice table, ended up packing enough for lunch for 2 people the next day. And the food surprising tasted even better after I heated it up in the microwave!  Thanks Quince for putting together this special Indonesian Rijsttafel feast! It was such a real culinary adventure!  *Source from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijsttafel)"}
{"text":"I came here recently with about 10 work colleges on a weeknight.  We were early so practically had the restaurant to ourselves.  The service was particularly attentive but this was likely a factor.  The atmosphere is modern and open yet I found it quite comfortable.  The lighting was well considered and made the space very inviting.  I had the salmon which was on a base of spiced cream with a potato cake.  It was prepared quite rare which I enjoyed although I wasn't asked how I liked it cooked (if you like it otherwise, it would be a good idea to speak up proactively)\.  The steak frites were commented on positively by the group who noted the quality of the meat and that the caliber of its preparation was high.   The deserts were particularly well done both in presentation and in taste.  Overall a solid mid-town choice."}
{"text":"I just found out that this place closed yesterday. I searched the news and their website, but no other information. Why?  All the dishes that I tried there were either extremely flavorific or mind-blowingly creative, most of the time both. I remember creamy asparagus soup and broccoli whose fractal heads were brought to a salty crisp with a technique that to this day I have not been able to identify.   Does anyone know what happened?"}
