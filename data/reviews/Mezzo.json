{"text":"The service here is fantastic.  I commend the kitchen on the hangar steak.  The atmosphere is nice as well.  It's elegant yet unpretentious. Anna really took care of us, as did Mike, the bartender."}
{"text":"I visited Mezzo for the first time before the Pirate game.  A very disappointing experience.  I ordered a brisket panini and it was 60% fat. When I showed this to our waiter he had no response.  He charged us for it and had no comment or apology.  I would never have thought a restaurant as pretentious as Mezzo would let this slide.
We had 7 people at our table who won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very cool interior and all staff we encountered were exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable about their food and wine offerings. Even offered some advice to us as tourists. 

We started with a sensational charcuterie platter with extensive choice of flavours. It was a great way to start and we followed up with a beautiful risotto. The suggested wine pairings worked well. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a trip to Mezzo as Sienna on the Square is one of my fav Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and this is essentially a sister. The service started out poor and continued throughout. Based on my observation it appeared they were understaffed for the crowd as our waiter had numerous tables. We were going in advance of a show and after we waited 22 minutes to get our waiter's attention after our reservation/seating time, we were finally able to order drinks for the table, along with food. My husband and I arrived earlier than the other couple and he ordered a drink which took nearly 15 minutes.  We made it clear to our waiter that we were going to an 8pm show so after waiting 22 minutes for any attention, we'd need to be accommodated. We were quickly told too bad and that everyone in the restaurant was going to the show. We finally received our entrees at 7:46pm (or reservation was at 6:30) which meant we were forced to shovel the food into our mouths. It was a damn shame because we all agreed our dishes were outstanding. This is the only reason they received any stars. Kuddos to the kitchen. Front of house needs to get their act together. I don't think this was the fault of our waiter but poor management of the wait staff. The wait staff were working their tails off for basically a bunch of unhappy people."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant this past Friday and the food and service were so excellent that we decided to return today Sunday during our short visit to Pittsburgh. Tonight we were greeted by Aisha who remembered us and welcomed us back. Our server Keith was professional and gave great menu and drink advice and the GM Blaze came to see that we were satisfied with our meal. Food was excellent, drinks were great, attention was exceptional without being oppressive, space is well designed and inviting- i hope we can return in nicer weather, all aspects of service were outstanding.
Over the two days we had the octopus and beef tartare (twice), the meat and cheese board, sausage fennel pizza and the shrimp diavolo."}
{"text":"The bruschetta, pizza and pasta were all amazing but the one thing missing was draft beer!"}
{"text":"The plates are listed as small, medium and large although apparently this doesn't relate to the quantity of food on each.  Not sure exactly what it relates to.  I ordered the scallops which was listed as medium but when the plate came there were 2 quarter seized scollops on top of some cooked greens.  Not my idea of medium, but as I said, perhaps this relates to something else.  My neighbor got a vegetarian dish which was listed as small and it's was over twice the size of mine.  Go figure?"}
{"text":"Food is good, and the service is excellent. It's expensive but you get a nice meal in a really comfortable space. The menu isn't big. If you like spicy food, you'll love the shrimp diavolo. Pizza is also good, but I like Proper's pizza better."}
{"text":"AMAZING Food and great service. We stopped by during a conference with a medium sized group and we're treated very well. Will return."}
{"text":"Best when the weather is nice and you can sit outside. Well constructed dishes, smooth service and a comfortable setting in the bustle of Market Square. If you like this kind of energy this is a great spot for you to try. PS-Take the T or use the valet to make life easier on yourself."}
{"text":"Wow!  the reviews are correct on this place.  In town for conference and found this on Yelp.  So glad we did!  Chef's Selection plate to start was fantastic... local cheese mixed with meat butchered and cured on site.  Amazing.  Cocktails were very good though a bit pricey.   All three entres ordered were top notch.  We had the fish of the day (salmon), the pork chop and the Genevese pasta dish.   All were fantastic.  Waitstaff did a great job as well.  Will be back again the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"MADE IT TO MEZZO...MIGHT GO BACK AND TRY MORE

Hi My Loves!

So I met up with Captain Cajun for dinner and to discuss the evil empire and the rise of the Sith Lords AKA ----. Had been to Sienna and the rooftop here but yet to partake in the second floors food!
We tried a bunch of small plates and the one that stood out was the crab risotto! I like it a lot!
Honestly, while talking away, I could not recall other dishes and felt they were not memorable!

I would like to come back and try the pizzas!

Love you all!
Muah"}
{"text":"I came here for my friends birthday dinner & I was thoroughly impressed! We started off with the fried Brussels sprouts with goat cheese & they were to die for. The Brussels sprouts were Cooked perfectly & paired very nicely with the goat cheese. We didn't leave any behind! 
I split the Bacon & Mushroom  pizza with a friend & it was delicious! We got the pizza with no mushroom but added sausage & arugula. The toppings paired perfectly all together. They used sauce cans for the pizza tray and I thought that was very clever and a tasteful spin on a tray! 
I gave 4 stars only because the menu was pretty small, I would've liked to see more options! Other than that it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Three friends and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night before an event over at The Warhol.  We made a reservation through Open Table, and I would recommend that because they were busy.

We all started off with a drink.  I had the Mezzorita, the Mezzo's take on a margarita.  It was good, but not great.  I'd get it again, but after trying the other cocktails.  Everyone else seemed to like their drinks.  For the main course, I had the wild mushroom risotto.  It was delicious.  I would definitely go back for that and I highly recommend it as one of their vegetarian options.  I had some friends get too much food, so I got to try some of the broccoli and eggplant pizza and rice pudding.  Both were delicious.

I'll be going back to Mezzo the next time I'm downtown for an event.  It's a nice place that is conveniently located to Downtown, the North Shore and the Cultural District.  Which means I'll be back there soon."}
{"text":"This was a very unique option for dinner.  The mercato has 2 different restaurants and a beer garden on the roof.  We started there with a cold beer on a warm night and it just seemed right.  I loved the open air venue that was hopping, but not too loud and crowded.  We then popped into Mezzo, their second level restaurant for dinner.  We had a great charcuterie board and a local farmers cheese board.  Don't let the name \"farmers cheese\" fool you.  There was a great variety of cheese from mild to strong and soft to hard.  For dinner we each had a pizza.  The bacon and egg was really unique and pretty tasty, though I would have preferred this as a breakfast pizza.  I had the quattro formaggi pizza that I thought was very good.  The place was completely full and that might have had something to do with our rather slow service.  Still it is a place I would return to."}
{"text":"So I'm giving Mezzo Three stars. Which they are receiving for the attentive wait staff, wine, and ambiance. I personally was not impressed with the food at Mezzo. I ordered a margarita pizza which was placed on top of an old tomato sauce can, which I thought was clever; however, the two person table I was seated at was a bit small for this set up. The pizza itself looked good, but came out tepid. The basil leaves were rather large and unfortunately there were a lot of them on the pizza, so they overpowered the thin, insipid sauce. I ended up having a few slices left over, but I let my date take those home. I'm a huge fan of pizza, so if that isn't good then I'm probably going to sulk the rest of the evening. 

Overall, the whole building is zero for two with me. I hope when I try the first floor meatball place I'm impressed or I will not be coming back to dine at any of the three levels."}
{"text":"Had a great, easy dinner here with colleagues in town for a conference. We had a mix of people and tastes, all which were happy with their selections. Our server was super helpful and efficient. Not a high end foodie place, but good for groups and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I love the space and the concept of the three story venue each offering something different. Mezzo (2nd floor restaurant) offers great food at somewhat reasonable prices. 
        Start with a cheese board and a bread selection, small portions but totally worth it. We felt the best way to try this menu would be to order a few things to split and we were right. The spicy shrimp pasta was AWESOME. Had a real kick to it but bearable. Margherita pizza was tasty too. 
        Before or after your reservation (or both) check out the bar on the third floor. I'm really excited to have dinner at the restaurant on the first floor as well. So much to do in that area!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day.  We were seated so quickly, which was a definite plus for a place that doesn't take reservations.  Service was outstanding.  Wine was delicious.  However, the food just wasn't that good.  My chicken was pretty undercooked (very pink), and the polenta was very soupy.  The pasta in the genovese was cooked just right but the meat was pretty toothy.  I will say the charcuterie was amazing, as was the tiramisu.  Verdict - come here for wine, charcuterie and dessert, skip the meal."}
{"text":"I agree, Yelp - As good as it gets! Starting with the service (especially Chris the manager) the staff is as welcoming as the decor. We had a large group (9) and we were late for our reservation. No problem, even with a packed house on Valentine's Day. We had a number of apps, including an outstanding bruschetta, and they were all well liked and devoured. There were a few pizzas for dinner that drew a lot of \"yum\" sounds, I sampled my wife's mushroom risotto that was truffle-laced heaven, and I ordered a hot sausage panini that was different and delicious. Can't say enough good things about Mezzo. Just remember the meatballs are only available downstairs!"}
{"text":"Spend your money somewhere else. The food is super salty and overpriced for what it is. Drinks take a long time to come, like 20 minutes. I've tried to like this place, really, but the last straw was the grouchy manager who was seemingly reprimanding a server on the floor? 

In this wonderfully diverse and vibrant food city, there are a ton of great places to eat... check out some place else."}
{"text":"Really lovely spot. This restaurant is located on the second floor on the building with awesome garage door windows. very cool vibe with chalk lettering on the walls. We sat at the bar and the bartender was lovely. We got a few drinks which he was more than happy to give suggestions and allow us to taste wines before we made a decision. 

We then ordered the grilled shrimp which were DELICIOUS. It was four shrimp two on each skewer with a delicious combo so things on tip including olives. We really loved it. Then we got the charcuterie tray which is highly recommended. They do farm to table style and it changes all the time so it'll be different every time you go. The man who brought it out explained everything on it, and gave suggested pairings. It was amazing and so was the info! And finally we finished the meal by splitting the scallops. And oh my gosh you should get these. They have an amazing crispness which I loved with bacon and shashito peppers. 

We will be back! It was all delicious and everyone was super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not picky. I don't like giving one star. I FEEL SO GUILTY DOING THIS.

The service was great but the food was very bland. For the price and location I expected something much better. 

I ordered the Deck Speck pizza which was actually delicious! But the 3 people who took me out for my birthday here were all really bummed about their food. I tried all of their dishes and they were right. Bland, overdone or underdone octopus (hardly edible). Pasta that was coldish and a little hard, very run of the mill pasta. 

Just bad and embarrassing that we spent so much money and planning to eat here."}
{"text":"Food is very good, but if you really like bad service delivered with a bad attitude, then Mezzo is for you."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant where I have received such great service!  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about all of the different menu items. My glass was always full and staff was attentive but not overwhelming. 

We had the Lamb Pasta, the Italian cheese tray, and the sausage and Pepper appetizer.  The server explained all of the different cheese to us and pairings. The cheese were definitely not for us but it was still very interesting to try them all. The sausage and Pepper appetizer was delicious as was the lamb pasta. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Mezzo!  The entire wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely.  I had Le Genovese - there aren't enough positive adjectives to describe this dish.  Savory, flavorful, tender... I could go on & on.  Bravo, Mezzo!"}
{"text":"My group arrived to Pittsburgh and the first place we wanted to try was Emporio.  I love meatballs and it's something that I really don't eat enough of.  BUT, the wait was super long and I wasn't sure whether it was the furry conventioneers or just a regular busy Thursday night.  After taking a peek upstairs at Mezzo and seeing that they didn't have a wait, we trekked up the floor to settle our hungry stomachs.

As tempting as the charcuterie and cheese board was, two people in my group ordered the chef's selections, I went in the opposite direction and got the mushroom risotto.  After eating literally eat every morsel of rice on that dish, I have to say that I was entirely satisfied.  It was the right portion and not too buttery rich.  And I did get to try some of the charcuterie from the table and it was exactly as advertised.  Rich, fresh, and left me wanting more.  

Mezzo actually had their own draft beer selection separate from the Il Tetto 36 draft selection but after asking our server if she can grab me their menu, she said that she can get me any of the beers from their list and bring it to our table.  

The dining room is a bit on the dark side and there wasn't a lot of ambient lighting.  Conversations also may be slightly difficult to have in the room but otherwise it was a fun, interactive, and different experience than what we could have had at Emporio.  I just need to make sure to come back here if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Mezzo is my favorite floor of the 3 floors of this Sienna restaurant.  It's nice that they take reservations, as the first floor does not.  The food here is excellent, for example the flatbreads are some of the best in Pittsburgh.  

We ordered the Chef's Bruschetta del Giorno, it's an item that changes daily, but were were absolutely enthralled by the creatively prepared bruschetta with pecorino cheese and Brussels sprouts.    

I ordered the mushroom risotto which was deliciously prepared.

The wine list is top notch, with lots of unusual options by the glass.  We arrived before the rest of our party, so we sat at the bar, and the bartender was extremely knowledgeable and let us sample a wine before we ordered.  He made us feel welcome and his recommendations were right on the mark.

Our waiter was excellent, too.  He overheard we were headed to the Benedum so he had the kitchen hurry our entrees, he was extremely attentive, helpful and on the ball.  

Overall, this is one of your best options to eat in the Cultural District.  Reliably great food, wonderful service, and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I've been to the 1st and 3rd floors of Sienna Mercato many times, but last night was the first time I got the chance to try out Mezzo!  My girlfriends and I went there for my birthday dinner and I was immediately impressed with the decor on the 2nd level.  The first floor, Emporio, is a bit darker and louder, but Mezzo was bright, open, and furnished in a way that made me feel like I was dining in someone's home. It was very welcoming and a step up from Emporio in all senses.

Our waiter thoroughly explained the menu and their specials of the day, and we placed our drink orders and requested the small PA Farmer's cheese board, along with the small bread basket (note: not complimentary. This is actually on their appetizer menu... I think it was $3 for the small).  The only bread I tried out of the basket was the rosemary garlic foccacia and it was SO good, especially with the whipped honey butter that the basket is served with.  

For dinner, 2 of the girls elected to split the Wood Roasted Vegetable pizza, the other ordered a half portion of the mushroom risotto, and I ordered a half portion of the sausage gemelli.  When our dishes arrived, I was very glad that I ordered a half portion:  it was still a fairly generous portion, but just enough that I didn't have leftovers to worry about carrying around.  I tried a bite of the pizza and risotto and both were very good... the pizza had a very thin crust, but it was substantial enough to withstand the weight of the sauce and toppings.  The mushroom risotto was phenomenal and will definitely be in my sights when I go back... and my sausage gemelli was outstanding!  My only complaint is that the gemelli was cooked a bit TOO al dente... as in almost not cooked thoroughly.  They had more of a bite to them than I prefer.  The cream sauce and fresh, crumbled sausage were excellent and I'm almost wishing I would've ordered the full portion so I could've had leftovers for lunch today!

Overall, Mezzo is a nice, open and airy spot for dinner and/or drinks and I would highly recommend it if you're downtown.   The prices are fairly reasonable, and they have a wide variety of wines and beers to choose from.  Another thing to note is that even though Mezzo is part of the Il Tetto and Emporio building/concept, they are each their own standalone restaurant with entirely different menus. No meatballs at Mezzo!  The nice thing is that this restaurant concept provides a variety of options for a night out.  From dinner to rooftop drinks, Sienna Mercato has you covered!"}
{"text":"I went here after an art crawl. It was beautiful outside and they had the side doors open to the air.

My waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. They gave me a water decanter on my table, but when my glass was empty they still came to the table to fill my glass.

The menu changes seasonally.  I ordered ricotta gnudi appetizer. It was a rolled and stuffed cheese with apple butter and seasonal ingredients,  it was good.

I also ordered the Bacon and Egg pizza with maple syrup. It tasted like breakfast! 

I sat by the window and people watched in the open air. Very relaxing.

This is the second floor of 3 floors of Sienna Mercato."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey but the food was great. I enjoyed my seafood pasta and the apple tart was definitely worth the order. I sampled all of my friends food and it was equally delicious. The vibe is real uptown  sheek if you get my drift but the music is Mello and chilled. Definitely a good look for a date."}
{"text":"First time here. Will definitely be on the list of repeat restaurants. It's a very cool space; huge garage door-type windows that were open to Penn Ave!  If only so many yinzers didn't smoke it would've been even more enjoyable(but that's not the restaurant's fault). 
Amazing beer list!  Hard to make a decision because there were so many good options!  Also many great wines to choose. 
We started with a small cheese plate and a small bread basket. Both were phenomenal although I was not a fan of the raisin chutney on the cheese plate. We split the peppers and Parmesan pizza. It was perfect!!  And I don't say that lightly. But be warned, those are fresh peppers and they pack a punch!
Staff was attentive, personable, and helpful...which is always refreshing!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Mezzo for the first time and had an excellent experience. I made a reservation online about a week prior to the Wednesday dinner. I browsed the menu online in anticipation of the meal. The friendly hostess seated our party of five at a comfortable six-top right by the window overlooking lively Penn Ave. Our courteous server guided us through the menu that offers a pleasing variety of food and drinks - including more options than are listed online. The highlights of my meal include the charcuterie board, the cheese board, and the lamb entree. The wine pairing was spot on.  The portions were elegant and satisfying. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. Our server was attentive and relaxed - keeping pace with our leisurely group. I highly recommend Mezzo for the delicious food, service, decor, and location. It's my new downtown go-to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Mezzo or even making it to the second floor of this three story establishment. I have been to Emporio (first floor) and Il Tetto (roof top) multiple times and really enjoy the atmosphere. When you first walk up to the second floor you will notice a wine wall with so much wine!! From the wooden floor, to the wooden dining tables/chairs and the rustic brick walls I felt like I walked into a Tuscan kitchen. 

For my meal I ordered the Pork Risotto and I do not regret this decision one bit! I really like that you can order a half portion. I always end up taking left overs home and tonight I am proud to say I finished an entire meal. I would absolutely get this again! 

One thing that bugged my friends and I was when we paid our bill the waitress came to pick her tip up while we were still sitting there talking. There was only one other table in there with us so it's not like we needed to hurry and rush out. Waiters/waitresses should never do that!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went here before going to our first ballet. Our server 'Ton' was passionate kind and well versed on the entire menu he made our experience a great one and everything we had was delicious.The runners were also very fast, efficient and we had no wait from dirty dishes on our table to fresh drinks. I never had to ask for anything which was very different. Its service and servers like this that really make you realize what a restaurant experience should be. I left inspired. And I say this as a Manager in this local food Industry. Thanks for hosting a beautiful date for my partner and I to remember. We hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"The small plates were amazing: delicious and complex (crab tartine and burrata); the large plates were good (mushroom risotto and shrimp fra diavalo). Super cute space! And wait staff were great."}
{"text":"Place was nice I sat at the bar. The meat and cheese boar was great! Chefs pick (is there really any other way!?) they gave me pickled asparagus that i wasn't so fond of and the big pieces of bread are not very finger friendly type... But the rest of the selection was great as was the wine! The food looked great as well. Although i didn't order any. 

A tip for this place- they are located on the
Second floor. You can hardly see the sign from the outside."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to a restaurant like this.

The menu is based around what is in season, the meat & cheese board is a sampler of food experiments by the chefs and what is available, and the staff waits on you like you are royalty. 

At least for your first visit, you must get the meat & cheese charcuterie board (or cheese only if you are vegetarian). This, more than anything else on the menu, showcases the creativity and originality that these chefs are putting in every single day to make this place the success that it is! My board had a pate made of beef knuckle and mustard seeds, cured ducked breast, a sheeps milk cheese with an espresso rind, a raging bleu cheese, and a 'loaded baked potato bread', beef-and-berry jam, among several others. 

The arugula salad with fingerling potatoes as a side dish was exceptional, as well as the port meatballs (although they are much more dense than the meatballs downstairs!) 

The pizza with pepperoncinis has an excellent crust, tangy cheese, and delicious peppers. However, the peppers are the hottest peppers I have ever had, and the menu gives you no clues that you will need to fill up your water glass several times to get through it!

For my birthday, they also served us a complimentary glass of champagne which capped off the night beautifully.

In my opinion, this isn't a place to grab drinks with friends or a quick bite on a weekend; that is more downstairs or at the biergarten upstairs. However, if you want a romantic, new food adventure, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been to Mezzo and I have not had a bad experience. The service is impeccable, even down to the bussers everybody is polished and seemingly intelligent. I would encourage you to plan to come here early and check out the rooftop bar which is absolutely amazing. 

At dinner we started with the Chef's Selection which is the Chef's Selection of Charcuterie, Cheeses, and Preserves, as well as bread. This plate was phenomenal and each pairing was better than the last. Additionally we ordered the poached pear appetizer and it was extremely well done overall. With goat cheese and Brussels sprouts this unique dish really will have you thinking.

Onto my meal - I stuck with what in most cases would be considered the boring choice \"Spaghetti and Meatballs\". However, this amazing dish has such a rich taste that it was anything but the boring. The meatballs were perfectly crafted, marinara with ricotta cheese, and basil to top it all off. 

Incredible experience yet again, I just wished I ordered a second dish to bring home."}
{"text":"Terrible service and just okay pizza. What a nice atmosphere and location to unfortunately have this restaurant have it. Not going back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner and really enjoyed my evening at Mezzo! I was here with a group of colleagues for a work social dinner and it was a perfect spot! (For those of you who don't know, Mezzo is on the 2nd floor of Sienna Mercato and the 3rd floor is the beer garden). 

For starters we had a very unique, and original salad. I wish I could remember the names of things... but I can tell you it had kalamata green olives, parmesan cheese, potato, and pistachio in it. It was so good, and the size was pretty decent, we shared 2 of them as an appetizer among the table of 6. 

For dinner I had the mushroom risotto, which was alright... I say just alright because looking back I wish I would have ordered a pizza. I tried the pizza with truffle oil, mushrooms, egg and some other toppings and that was amazing! I have been dreaming about and craving for that pizza ever since I tried it. One nice thing is they do half orders of the pastas, so at least I didn't order too much pasta before I realized the pizza was better! 

They have a wine bar upstairs on the 2nd floor as well, and a nice selection of drinks to choose from. 

Overall, it was a good night and the food was really good. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. The ambiance is also amazing and it is a fun place to go! The pumpkin risotto, salads, and cheese plates were all so delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp before. Never compelled to do so, but could not share about my experience at Mezzo. Awful. Took my husband and father out for Father's Day. Couldn't have had a worse experience. The restaurant is the middle section of a three tiered \"open warehouse\" type atmosphere. Which equates to a balmy room with little circulation. The waiter was very nice, but service timing was horribly slow. Long time for drink orders and waited a long time for bad tasting food to come out. I ordered a margherita pizza for my kids and added bacon for them for an extra $2 and came out with barely a slice of undercooked bacon, which I took off bc didn't want my kids eating it.  Calamari was tasteless. Gnocchi was good. I had a $32 tuna which was over cooked and insanely salty. For that price, I assumed it was ahi Tuna and it wasn't. It also came with some black weird tasteless spongy cakes.  I couldn't really complain about my meal since my husband and father both had the Seafood pasta. They were both so dissatisfied that they needed to return the dishes. It was with a red sauce with indiscernible pieces of seafood slop. The waiter knowing that we were dissatisfied, spoke with the manager, offered them to make them another dish for which we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for. At this point, my kids kept saying Mommy why aren't we leaving yet. Waiter said manager comped us our few drinks from our tab, but NEVER had to decency to come speak with us ourselves. Which was probably the most annoying part of it all. The attempt for customer service recovered was non-existent and they seemed as though they didn't care. I have a degree in Hospitality so I know how these situations needed to be handled and some management or someone other than our server should have spoken with us. I go out to eat all the time in Pittsburgh and I was so disappointed that I failed my husband and dad for Father's Day and had to spend $200 to do so for my party of 4 adults and 2 kids (that had a $20 pizza)"}
{"text":"Over-priced and mediocre. I had the pear appetizer, which was lacking in any discernible flavor, and a green salad which I swear had those same onions in a can you use for green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. The service was stupid and even though I said I was a vegetarian, they did not volunteer that the peppers that came with my bread were cooked in pork fat till I asked what they were (why did they bring those to a vegetarian at all?). 

I had a delicious cocktail to start the meal, which is responsible for one of the two stars I am awarding Mezzo."}
{"text":"I enjoy all of the levels of Sienna Mercado, but my love of grazing on cheese makes me a dedicated fan of Mezzo.

On one particular visit with a friend, we ordered a charcuterie board and mushroom pizza to share (paired with a couple glasses of wine a piece). Everything was delicious and the charcuterie was varied and we'll paired with the cheeses."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked and was wanting to go. I was super excited when my hubby told me that we had reservations there for Valentine's Day. 
We checked with the hostess and she seated us at a table for two. There were tables for two on each side of us. The table at the window was empty. Our first mistake was not asking to be moved there. It was empty the whole time we were there. Instead we had couples on both sides of and it felt like we were a table of 6. No privacy. No romance. We had high hopes for the food which was the second mistake. We ordered a breadbasket and a bowl of olives. The bread basket had several different types of bread. It came with a small container of honey and a small container of peppers and onions. The types of bread were explained to us which was nice. My husband enjoyed the peppers and onions mixture. I was having butter. It was a great consistency but was sweet. I wasn't expecting sweet butter. The bowl of green olives (with pits) had olive oil, lemon, and oregano. They were definitely one of my top two foods I had for dinner. They give you a small dish to put your pits in. It was a nice touch. 
For dinner we both went with the specials. My hubby ordered the pork w/mashed potatoes and I ordered the filet and shrimp which came with potatoes and green beans. I tried my husbands pork and his mashed potatoes. The pork was good but a smidge underdone. His mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth. The gravy was nice also. It was dark and rich and the right consistency. 
My potatoes were a tall stack of thinly sliced potatoes. It was cubed. I divided the tall stack into 3 small stacks. The stack that had been the bottom had potatoes that were almost raw. The next stack I tried was the middle and the potatoes were cooked a little but still close to raw. There was no seasoning on them. No salt, pepper, or anything. So basically a stack of raw(ish) and tasteless potatoes. The green beans were cooked correctly but the ends had been left on. I've never eaten somewhere that didn't break or chop off the ends. My second favorite food was the shrimp. I think they had been butter poached but I'm not sure. They were a nice size and consistency. The filet was ok. I thought there was a bit too much char on it and it didn't have much taste. I was super disappointed. 
For dessert we also went off the menu and I ordered the hazelnut chocolate dessert. It was pretty to look at-a small chocolate done with a swirl of caramel on the plate. It had chopped hazelnuts sprinkled on top. When you opened the dome there was a mousse inside that was more like ice cream than mousse. Doesn't that sound delightful???  It was not. I don't know how you can put chocolate, hazelnuts and caramel together and have it come out bland but it was. I even had my husband try it. 
The 3rd and biggest mistake I think we made was ordering the specials instead of off the menu. IF I were to go back it would be to try a few menu items. That's a big IF. The best thing about our dinner was our waiter. He did a great job and it's because of him that I'm giving the 3rd star. Otherwise there would only be two."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of Mezzo. I came here for an early dinner last night and since it was warm, the large windows were open. I ordered fried zucchini and an arugula salad; both of which were pretty good. The chefs have a strict policy of no substitutions so I was told that I could not order my salad and add chicken for a protein. I still enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"We love this place. If you stick to the \"safe stuff\" on the menu, like a margherita pizza, you'll be underwhelmed. Go for the risottos, the specialty pizzas, and the salumi platter, which we think rivals Cure's in taste though not cost! 

We like sitting at the bar and watching the cooks for a casual meal. There's usually not a super long wait for a table, and if there is the rooftop bar is great too."}
{"text":"Our late Friday arrival in Pittsburgh, left us without any food plans, so we chose this stack of three eateries because it was walkable from our hotel, and it looked as though other food options were close by. We followed the path of least resistance and landed in Mezzo, because we were able to find a couple of bar seats, despite a considerable crowd. The happenstance was serendipity! 
Our charcuterie plate was spot on, offering an array of meats, ranging from buttery fat prosciutto, to a fiery sopressata. The pate was mineral-ly goodness, and a chutney that provided a delicious, acidic offset, was good. Our bread assortment featured an interesting sweet lard spread, and when we ordered a bowl of green olives, our bartender suggested a wine that made the olives even more enjoyable. 
We also opted for the local cheeses, finding a bleu cheese that we liked so well, we sought it out the next day while visiting the strip. 
The atmosphere was warm, and inviting, inspiring chat with others at the bar, which we enjoyed. 
For an unplanned stab at our first dining experience ever, in Pittsburgh, Mezzo set the tone for a great weekend in the city. If you like to chill, and graze, it's a great choice!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Mezzo and I was happy with the food. We had the small bread basket for two of us (don't need the large unless you want to stuff yourself with bread.) I had the brussel sprouts, they were extremely good and the goat cheese pairing was phenomenal. The cheese had a slight smoky flavor that really complimented the apple glaze. I was a bit disappointed when I found out the sprouts were fried. My friend had the apple salad and it was good as well. 

For the entree we shared a chicken Parmesan. It was perfect for sharing as it came with two pieces of chicken. It was good, but nothing to brag about. 

Overall the food quality is good, you will pay a small premium for it, but worth the occasional visit. I did like that each check comes with a cookie, ends the meal with a sweet feeling about the place!"}
{"text":"Great place ! We went here for the first time and were not disappointed. The wines, cocktails, birch beer and Shirley Temple were absolutely amazing. The appetizers were great and the desserts really put a big finish. I recommend the mushroom risotto and the Quattro Fromaggio pizza. Loved it!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals in Pittsburgh hands down. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. We started off with the bruschetta that was topped with bacon and tons of veggies the split the pork rassito(spelling) and split the eggplant pizza. I was shocked how delicious the eggplant pizza was, it was very good. The price of the food was very reasonable about 15-20 bucks a plate. The wine bottles were overpriced at 50 so we went with a glass of wine at 10 instead. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Outstanding waitress
Nice house cured meats.
Tasty and interesting pizza.
PA Cheese Board with apple butter was delicious.
Pistachio and Porchetta with Arugula pizza was sweet and tasty.
Margherita pizza was good too!


Looks like Yelp may finally have it figured out.  You can actually do a search for Mezzo and get it...have been waiting about six months for that..LOL"}
{"text":"Great food, bar, and location. Will be back. Arugula salad and parmesan risotto were delicious. The staff is very knowledgeable about the food."}
{"text":"Salumi Plate - asked waiter, specifically, what was on plate.  He said \"4 types of salami and one of something else\".  It arrived and was only 2 salami's and 3 other things my partner nor I would eat.  Disappointing he was so uninformed and just defensive.   The pizza's -- one was FAR TOO SALTY, had to ask to remake without putting salt on it.  The pizza chef went nuts with the salt.  Pistachio/porchetta pizza was VERY heavy, not thin crust, me thinks.  Charred broccoli was the best of the dishes.  So, not planning to return.  Mezzo=mediocre, disappointing."}
{"text":"When it comes to Sienna Mercato, I can not choose a favorite level. To me they are all great. 

Mezzo is different because they take reservations (which is almost absolutely needed when something is going on in the CD), where as the first floor does not. 

Their menu tends to have an Italian flare that always suits my fancy in one way or another.

From the small to large plates, I always tend to have a home run whether it's fish or a piece of beef. Though, salmon tends to be my go to since they tend to prepare it a different way every season.

I have had two different tartares (salmon and beef) and they were fantastic.

The desserts are always very scrumptious and they usually have a great variety to choose from.

And the drinks O.M.G they are a must! Between the drinks and the wine list, I am always in heaven (it probably feels that way after a few drinks, but still)!

The service is always attentive and very helpful. Never had a complaint in that department!"}
{"text":"This is surprising nice. Great food, large menu, food allergy friendly, fair prices, and exceptional service.

However, this restaurant is very large and is not a place for a low-key quiet meal. But that said, it is a nice option for a pre-show dinner."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic service and the cured meats are really well done.  They always seem happy to steer you in the right direction if you can't decide.  This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was recently here and started with the bread and butter. What is in the butter. Oh my god. Delicious. The bread was incredible. We also got the bruschetta which was not traditional but amazing. I had the risotto and honestly dream about it. Not your usual take on risotto. Everyone else had pizza and they loved it. It was a great meal. Our server was a darling!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful environment and delicious food! They give you amazing ginger type cookies with the check as well. Nice servers. Very good experience!"}
{"text":"Service was great. They were attentive and very friendly. The food is overpriced. I'm glad that we ordered a pizza during Happy Hour because it would not have been worth the original $19. It was a nice place to sit for Happy Hour, but I wouldn't go otherwise."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Service was excellent but the food was not. I started with the fried calamari. How it managed to arrive without flavor is beyond me. Normally fried food is great just because it's fried but this calamari had no flavor, just crunch. Then I had the chicken over polenta which was strictly white meat and arrived over what seemed more like cream then polenta. It was not so much comfort food as food. I capped things off with he strawberry panna cotta. The dessert arrived with angel food pieces that tasted better than the panna cotta. If you're hungry you can get a meal at a decent price here. Just don't expect it to give you any thrills."}
{"text":"I'm glad I was finally able to check this place out recently. A group of us stopped in on a Friday evening for dinner and drinks, and had no trouble getting a table quickly even though the restaurant was fairly busy. I love the large and open space, and the windows overlooking the street below. The garage doors were open and the space was nice and breezy. 

I started by splitting the eggplant involtini with a friend along with a delicious red blend. The dish was essentially a \"fancy\" mozzarella stick with eggplant inside--and I mean that in a good way. The dish includes only two of the little rolls, so we probably could have ordered another appetizer along with it. 

My friend and I decided to also split a pizza, and we ordered the picante salami and peppers. The salami and banana peppers were delicious and perfectly spicy. I actually tasted some spice in the sauce as well--I'm a lover of spicy foods to no complaints here. We were quite hungry before dinner and had no trouble demolishing the whole pizza between the two of us, but you could probably get away with splitting it three ways if you are also having apps/other dishes.

I'm only giving three stars because the service was bizarre. I appreciate when waiters and waitresses take the extra step to educate you about a restaurant, its menu, and what they have to offer; however, I felt like it was taken too far and the whole experience was condescending. It was sort of like being a child and having someone explain how to read a menu to you. Also, someone at my table had a nut allergy and asked about a possible accommodation--she was immediately told \"no\" without any hesitation. Once pressed, he finally went to ask the kitchen and came back stating that it would be perfectly fine. I understand that some things are premade and cannot be changed, but this was a really basic request and the kitchen clearly had no problem with it. So why not go ask before aggressively telling us no accommodations can be made? On that same note, they give you small pieces of biscotti with your check (we loved this detail), but the waiter made an unnecessary comment that \"he didn't bring a piece for (the person with the allergy) because they contain nuts and he doesn't want her to die.\" Thanks for remembering and giving a warning, but maybe next time try to tone down the passive-aggression.

Overall the food and space were great. Service, well, I think we just were not so lucky that day. I will probably give it another try."}
{"text":"Another reason to love Sienna Mercato! My first experience with Mezzo was deeelicious. They have your typical Italian fare with a few unique spins to the menu. I went for the Vegetable Panini which was amazing! Nice thick, crusty toast with perfectly roasted vegetables in a cheesy blanket. SOO yummy! I also ordered a side of spaghetti squash which is surprisingly sweet because it's tossed in a honey blend. Sounds strange but it was a nice contrast to the savory panini. Definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone in an Italian mood. Mezzo will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We thought that we would give Mezzo a try, since most of the Yelp reviews were positive. Let me start off with the positive parts:

Service was very good.
Good selection of wines by the glass, and reasonable prices.

The food was underwhelming at best, and sometimes disappointing. I would say that the salmon tartar tasted like it was made out of smoked salmon, not fresh. The dressing on the salad was anything but a jalapeño vinaigrette - I could have sworn that it came right out of a bottle of Hidden Valley ranch dressing. The chicken was flavorless, although the vegetables that accompanied it were tasty. The cornbread added absolutely nothing to the plate but taking up space. The box of bread that we ordered was average. The complementary cookie that came with the bill tasted like it came out of a box.

I am sure that there are better options in Pittsburgh than this."}
{"text":"I'm really won over by this whole group. I love Mercato aka meatball heaven. I love the rooftop deck and I now love Mezzo. Their specialty is wood fired pizza's and wine. Definitely speaking my language.

I was very excited about the pizza's we choose. I was most surprised to like the Sausage & Smoked Potato pizza the best. It was tomato, smoked mozzarella, basil, and of course potato. I loved the smokey flavor! 

I also liked the Picante Salami & Peppers. It was tomato, mozzarella, chili, pickled banana peppers. I love me some banana peppers on a pizza, and pickled ones, YUM. The Margherita, with tomato, mozzarella, basil was good. Of course it's the most basic of all of them, but still good. 

I love the aesthetic too. Definitely more chill up here than the other two spots. I'd be interested to check out their pasta dishes next. Let's be honest, I'm interested in checking out all dishes here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were meeting a friend from San Francisco for dinner and wanted a good place to eat near the Westin Hotel. We had walked by Sienna Mercato and Mezzo earlier in the day but hadn't paid much attention to either. However, since it was getting late and they are open until 10 am we decided to give Mezzo a try. It is located on the second level above Sienna Mercato. We were pleasantly surprised with the menu and the variety of options. There were so many good things on the menu we had trouble deciding what to try. As it turned out all of our dinners were wonderful. I had the La Genovese, a beef pasta dish, and an Arugula salad. My wife had Salmon Tartare and a spinach salad. We split an order of fried zucchini that was delicious. Also, the background music was nice. It was classic soft rock like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, etc. They have garage door windows on the front that were open, but were later closed when it started raining. The open windows allowed for a very nice soft breeze on this June evening. Also, the service was very good. We all thoroughly enjoyed the evening at Mezzo."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner yesterday evening after walking around the Three Rivers Art festival. My date actually recommended their pizzas and that's what I got! I got the duck speck pizza and it was pretty freaking delicious. The duck was so good and the pizza was a pretty decent size. Crust was perfectly toasted!

My date got the choose three option. The fried calamari was really good. The shrimp fra diavlo was okay. We got the fallen chocolate soufflé cake and it was to die for! Super delicious, I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing...

Service was really good! She was very attentive to us and super nice. She did a really good job. I hope to come here again in the future! This restaurant is a lil pricey for a poor recently graduated college student, but it's definitely worth a try or for a special occasion. (Food photo creds to my date - HAHA)"}
{"text":"The service started off great! I sat at the bar and felt like the sever was going to be on point. I order a starter. The starter shrimp fritters came out really fast and was really tasty. The bar tender came back and still was very attentive. I asked some questions about the drink and settled for the most expensive drink on the menu related to cocktails. 

I waited for him to come back for a few moments and ordered a pizza. It took the pizza around 15 mins to come out and as I am sitting there watching him make drinks hoping mine was coming. It never came, the pizza came, I ate and was never checked on again the rest of my visit. 

The pizza was good and I know your thinking why did I not say anything. The bar is rather different and you don't sit in-front of the bar tender, he passed behind me several times and refused to make eye contact. 

My water was empty and I had to almost grab him to get a refill. He never came back, I had to walk up to him to get my ticket. The restaurant was busy when I arrived and started to empty as I was there. So it's hard to understand why he was not more attentive to his guest. 

My $14 drink never came, the business lost revenue. I am pretty sure them manager was walking behind me the entire time as well, saw me looking around and never checked on me once. I visit here often, love to try all the cool food places every trip. This was a poor experience and I may never return. Beware."}
{"text":"Amazing is not enough. The drinks were amazing very well done Manhattan. Me and my friend went down the drink menu they were all fantastic. Favorite was the orange Julius Cesar. The meat and local cheese plate were amazing choices. The octopi pizza was amazing. The flavored on that were insane between the olives and octopus and squid was amazing."}
{"text":"The zucchini appetizer came out with 3 very small slices and the charge $8 for it.  Would never come here again."}
