{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time and absolutely loved it! Very impressed with their friendly service for an asian restaurant. Will be back for sure next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It opened two weeks ago and I went last week and again this week - both times it was excellent. A number of my colleagues have also eaten there and I haven't heard one bad review yet. Their lunch special is awesome value and they even make exceptions for me (replacing sushi from california roll combo with salad). The staff are super friendly, gracious and kind, and the food is prepared with a crazy attention to detail (down to the star-shaped carrot garnish). For $6.99 it's an unbelievable deal. So glad they came to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Pretty surprised by this actually.  Not the absolute best restaurant by any means, but its decent. Typical of the yonge/bloor corridor, this place offers Asian Fusion (sidenote: WHAT IS UP WITH THAT) Regardless, Tasty Asian has a mix of thai, chinese and japanese dishes. 

Full Star for the $6.99 lunch special. Choice of an app, a side and a main. I had Agedashi tofu which was not great but decent, a seaweed salad which was pretty standard and a salmon sushi, a tuna sushi and a salmon maki roll. Fish tasted fine, presentation was lovely with cucumber flowers and the like. Wasabi was weak but I'll forgive them. Point is. its $6.99 and tasty. Service is friendly, ambiance is a-ok.  Comparing this to my recent $14.99 lunch special at Spring Rolls which was bordering on awful. (horrifically bad service too) 

Is it my go-to place? No. Is it a good choice for a cheap lunch? Yes. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not too shabby at all.  Good, solid takeout sushi.  Tried the \"pizza\", which was interesting - basically a deep fried patty of rice with (in my case) spicy salmon on top.  Some interesting rolls, all of which was competently prepared.  And, they threw in some edamame for free, which was very nice.

I'd order from there again."}
{"text":"There are only two things to look for in a good restaurant - good service and good food. Tasty has just that. I went there two days after they opened with my boyfriend and absolutely love it. They are very serious  and creative about food and pay attention to every detail. Sean and Leo are two brothers that run Tasty and are very passionate about the place. I love supporting independent business's and hope nothing but success for these two young men. This is defiantly my new favourite restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in my neighbourhood. My boyfriend and I spotted it because we often get home from work late & are always looking for good places in the area that are open. We were also sad that another neighbourhood Japanese place, Toko, was closed. We've been twice so far, and both times we had takeout, but we ordered it there and waited for it.

I am reviewing it anyways because frankly, I was really impressed. First, a note: The asian food is far more Japanese based than Chinese, so if you want greasy chicken balls, it is not the place to come. However, they have a pretty extensive selection (there is a lot more on the menu in the restaurant than the actual takeout menu, I think) and everything I have tried, personally, is very good.

It gets such a high review because both times we were there, about 1.5 months apart, the customer service was AWESOME.

While we waited, the waitress brought us mugs of green tea. I know it's customary in Japanese places, but we made it clear it was takeout, and we were ordering. We were set up at a table with green tea anyways. The second time, we were brought an appetizer anyway, with a cheerful \"on the house!\" (Yep, that's points from me!) Once they included complimentary cans of pop.

I have had better Japanese food in my life, but the food is VERY decent, it's open incredibly late, and the customer service went above and beyond. I'm going to come here more."}
{"text":"Epic Fail! 

#1. The order took my address wrong, not by number, but entire streets.
#2. Order taker took apartment # wrong
#3. Buzzer number not recorded
#4. Almost no beef in Kung Po Beef
#5. Little meat / veggies in Lo Mein, it was 90% noodle. WTF?
#6. 1 HOUR 20 min. wait for delivery, understand I could walk there in 10 min. 
Seriously???? 

EPIC FAIL, will not order again from these people."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Tasty Asian a few times (through Just-Eat) and have been impressed each time. 

They have a nice selection of Japanese food, and great sushi rolls. The wait time for delivery is long, but that may be based on Just-Eat taking the order. Each time we've ordered, our sushi has been fresh and delicious. Usually, they'll send you a nice freebie too."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before a play at Panasonic theater a few doors up. The interior is divey, particularly the lower level bathrooms (lovely Biggie  and Tupac art on display). It is clean, if not totally inviting. The green salad was very good. My friend and I both had Thai curry. Very generous portions, but the curry was pretty bland and overly corn starched. The veggies in it were plentiful and good quality. Neither of us was unhappy exactly, but I'd order something else. Friendly service and good prices."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. 
Very great lunch specials, and the food is pretty tasty. The only reason it doesn't get a full 5 stars is because I think their pad thai is a bit bland. 
Vegetable tempura for lunch is great, and they even give you a small desert with lunch special, really great deal."}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant and noticed that they were open really late, which is really rare for a japanese restaurant so I thought I would give it a try after a night out and boy, I was shocked! Service was excellent, the food presentation was great, the quality was good as well, even though I usually go there really late at night. We also got delivery from them one time at 230(i know shameful) but it was wonderful. Servings were great and I would go back here any time!  Prices are okay for the area. I usually get the Salmon Kill Set (horrible name) and that is 13.99 + Tax. 

So if you are craving sushi past 11, this is the place to order from!!"}
{"text":"very nice warm and friendly staff and the food is delicious, very reasonably priced too
they just opened a week ago"}
{"text":"I got delivery from here and it was an awful experience. I ordered around 11:00 pm and my order was supposed to come at 12:15 am. I called the restaurant at 12:30 am when my food still hadn't arrived and the lady who answered gave me some long explanation of why the food was late. I don't really care lady, I want my food. 

When it came the driver was very, very creepy. He barely knocked on my door...like not even a tap. If I wasn't hungry I wouldn't have heard him at all. He was bouncing around outside my apartment door, talking very rapidly. I found out I didn't even get my full order and he had to come back. He was nice enough to return the tip I gave him, but I didn't take it (maybe it's his first day, I don't know. It's late, he can keep it).

I threw up the sushi. The fish was bad. The rice was bad."}
