{"text":"Today I ordered an Italian calzone and two diet cokes.  The food was very good.  I gave only three stars because of the delivery!  I was notified through the yelp app that delivery would be @ 6:24pm.  At 6:45 I went through the app for an update on my order.  I was informed that they couldn't get through.  I then called the restaurant.  I was informed the order was with the delivery person. At 6:55 my order finally arrived.   I asked him if the food was hot.  He then copped an attitude with me and asked if I was going to give a one star review.  I found the man rude, and his attitude did not encourage repeat business!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is tasty, and I must eat gluten free, not a fad.  I have not tried the GF pasta options so far.  My husband and grandson like the regular pizza, too."}
{"text":"Great big tasty submarines... loaded and full of flavor...roll just makes it supreme... nice atmosphere...friendly staff.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband & I were not impressed with Nippers. We ordered food for delivery. When I called to ask the soup of the day, the man who answered the phone said \"we don't have soup\", however, the menu lists \"soup of the day\". The pizza was expensive & just mediocre, wings were tasteless and had hardly any sauce on them. The Italian hoagie was drenched in dressing and soggy. Why they did not serve the dressing on the side for a delivery sub, I'm not sure. We were very disappointed in our first experience with Nippers."}
{"text":"Cannot comment on food, becuase we left after sitting down for 10 min. No one at front when we came in and no sign to wait to be seated so we seated ourselves. Server totally ingored us. Waited to get his attention, but wouldnt look our way. So we left. Went across to iO."}
{"text":"Order a steak sub and wings, sub was not cut and bread was rock hard, wings were the worst I have ever had. Definitely not worth the money"}
{"text":"Ordered a simple pizza and pepperoni roll at 11:00 PM. They said it'd be here within 40-60 minutes and then I got an update saying it would be another 22 minutes late because they're busy. Okay, fine. I get a phone call at 12:22 AM by the driver who says he's outside. Go to my door, not outside. So I call him back and he says he's at a house in Bridgeville, which is not where I live and I put my address in correctly. It's now 12:42 AM, 1 hour and 42 minutes later and I just got my food. He showed me the receipt which apparently said I'm in Bridgeville but I am looking over my order again and it says I'm in Carnegie. Something is wrong with the ordering system and it needs fixed. If you're really hungry and impatient I wouldn't order here."}
{"text":"Good deals for decent food. Prices are reasonable and low wait times. Only ever get takeout or delivery so I'm not sure about the dine- in experience but for the price very few places beat their deals on their website"}
{"text":"In a year, two out of three times I walked into the newly renovated Nippers no staff was there to greet me, and perhaps because of this, no customer was in the room either. Yelling out hello was met with silence save for the news blabbering on the big screen in the dining room. No one was there! One time two ladies came in behind me and we joked for 5 minutes that one of us could probably start making our own food in the kitchen. Ridiculous. We all left as someone was coming back inside from out back.  The one time I ate there, it was okay. The renovations look like they want to be a more highly respected pizza joint, but the service speaks otherwise."}
{"text":"Food was very good, especially the pizza but service was very, very, very slow. Waiter constantly apologized and may have been overwhelmed doing everything from waiting to cashiering to clearing tables. They need more help when busy. Pizza was good but must have sat awhile as it lukewarm when served. Price for hoagie and chicken salad was a bit high, although salad was good. Reason for 2 stars is very slow and poor service especially when you have other things to do and want to get home"}
{"text":"Meatball sub came cold with little to no sauce. \"Steak\" fries that came as microwaved McDonald's fries, unedible. They stated they were out of steak fries after complaint and sent regular fries. Food was terrible, spoke with owner, he apologized and left it at that. Told me to complain to uber eats about it. Won't be there much longer so I would steer clear."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery through the Eat24 app twice now and and have yet to be disappointed. Their prices are a little lower than other pizza shops around Lebo which is a nice change. Nippers has a decent menu and there seems to be something for everyone. The pizza is pretty traditional and super tasty. We've also ordered salads (with super fresh green peppers!) and the Buffalo fries. The fries confused me a little, I assumed they'd be doused in Buffalo sauce but they just had seasoning on them. We have plenty of Buffalo sauce at home so we dipped the fries in that and they were great! I've never actually been inside of Nippers but from the outside you can see they recently renovated and it looks cute inside. They also serve breakfast now, and judging from their pictures posted on Instagram it's something I need to check out. Oh, they are BYOB! I definitely recommend a trip (or an order through eat24) to Nippers!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Nippers and the food was amazing. Nippers received three stars because the delivery drivers forgot our drinks and dessert the first time and one of our drinks the second time. While, the pizza, wings, hoagie, and gyro were amazing I probably won't be ordering delivery from them next time. I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Great! Still under construction but food is yummy. Salads were  nice mix of greens and huge. Pizza good. Much nicer decor and such friendly staff. Inexpensive too!  Definitely will return here."}
{"text":"The pizza is regular, nothing special. The hoagies are horrible! We tried the Italian last time and the steak this time, both were gross. Very over priced for the quality. Plus it took an hour and thirty minutes! I called after an hour and I was told it was on its way. Once the delivery guy showed up he had no clue as to if I paid already. Horrible service and after trying twice we will not order from here again."}
{"text":"This is our little neighborhood pizza shop. The new owner is a really nice guy who you can tell is very excited about this place. It's been a labor of love and it shows. The pizza is pretty good but I love their chicken salad. It's an easy, low key spot to swing by for a quick, good bite and you can totally byob."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been rooting for Little Nipper's for years - against the snooty service and high prices at neighoring Bado's (plus, Nipper's pizza is better), but I think I'm done.  I've been there about 6 times in the past year with my kids to dine in.  Never once has there been more than ONE other table occupied, and never once has there been someone in the dining room to greet us.  We always feel awkward and question if they're open, and then we finally just sit and wait and eventually someone will come out from the back.  I think there is one cook, based on what I've seen and how long it takes for our food to come out.  Maybe all their business is in delivery; but in that case they should have more than one cook.  Nipper's just redecorated the interior and exterior of their restaurant, but they just never appear ready for actual customers."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write this review, but since I haven't received the coutesy of a reply to my email to Nipper's Pizzeria, explaining my disappointment with the pizza, I needed to write this review! I had a pizza delivered to my home, just a few miles from the pizza shop, and it arrived cold! No one bothered to apologize or ask me any questions about ,the pizza delivery, so I will never order anything else from this place or refer anyone!  Someone should have replied to my email!"}
{"text":"I am new here from Oregon, this pizza is excellent and the staff is nice.  Dough is more NY style, which is what I love."}
