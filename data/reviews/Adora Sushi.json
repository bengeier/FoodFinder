{"text":"The service was horrid, I was told to finish all my food before ordering more...who is the paying customer here?!!!!  The service was very poor and the food was horrible!  If you want to make this an outing an all night affair, this is the place for you.  Not recommended...this place will be out of business, it is a matter of time."}
{"text":"By far my favourite sushi restaurant in Durham region! The selection is amazing and service is very friendly. As well, you can't beat the 15% discount you receive for paying cash (both lunch and dinner!) - comes to about $14 for lunch with the discount. I am completely obsessed with their cheese wontons and miso soup! It is a very large restaurant and doesn't ever seem to be really busy but don't let that deter you. I am so glad I happened to come by this gem in Whitby! It is definitely a must try for any sushi lover! Drinks and dessert are free with all you can eat. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery online and received a phone call that they were out of soba noodles and the person the phone wasnt very helpful in sorting out an alternative. Overall I was satisfied with the food quality and menu. The delivery person however was extremely rude. Not sure if I would order again based on the way he and the person on the phone interacted with me."}
{"text":"I don't know about everyone else, but my table always gets great and attentive service when we come for lunch (but we chose to have the dinner menu). For $18.95 on a weekday, it's a great price, because their dinner menu has A LOT of choices on it and it's AYCE. Not to mention you get 15% off if you pay with cash!

The sashimi was good, and they arrange it very pretty on the plate. Our server was prompt in clearing the empty dishes from our table, and although they don't check up on you often, they are quick to come to the table when you raise your hand and make eye contact.

I also really love that they serve Takoyaki (squid balls) here, and they're delicious too! I am also in love with their beef skewers, which are super juicy and yummy and have the perfect amount of salt and flavouring.

They also have this dessert roll called \"Ice Age\" that was actually pretty yummy. It's ice cream, tempura bits, and mango wrapped in rice paper. I've never tried, or heard, of anything like that so it was a good experience.

I also liked that they had a dessert and ice-cream bar included. There's not a huge selection for the cakes, and there's a small bowl of jello(sometimes), but usually, the AYCE sushi places that I go to don't even have that included, so that was nice.

This is a nice place with many booths, and the interior is very classy and modern. It looks really nice inside. It's a plus that many of their dishes also don't include MSG!"}
{"text":"As a customer that visits Adora Sushi regularly, I have a hard time understanding all the negative reviews this place has gotten.

I absolutely LOVE sushi and have visited Adora Sushi, Tatemono, and Sushi Mountain regularly until I finally decided that Adora is truly the best. With their 15% off special if paying with cash deal, there is no question in my mind I would choose Adora over all other sushi restaurants in Whitby, ON.

When you visit, make sure to try their Arctic Roll. That alone makes the trip worth it for me each and every time."}
{"text":"Uh, yum? Can you say it with me? Y-U-M! Other people who have given Adora a bad review need to get their heads checked. This place gives you good quality for a good price. They could totally get away with charging more, but I'm happy they don't. I definitely recommend the green salad, the chicken skewer, the arctic roll (so good!), the baby mushrooms wrapped beef, and the coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Poor service, and it isn't even very busy. A lot of my order never arrived, and no refills on my drink. Food is pretty good, mango salad was quite strange though: I don't recommend it. Will probably not eat here again, as Whitby has a lot of other good sushi places."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok, some of the menu items are very odd - stay away from the \"mango salad\" it is honestly disgusting with a creamy thick dressing that tastes awful.
The curry chicken is deep fried and the curry sauce tastes like a weird gravy.
Service is not great, the staff is pretty snarky.
The takeout menu indicates they do delivery (with a map of the delivery area) but when I called they informed me they don't?
The online ordering also doesn't work.
We won't be back.  Too bad as they are the closest sushi place to Brooklin."}
{"text":"We decided to try this on the advice of others and the reviews we had read. Sadly we left disappointed in the food, price and service. The food was average at best. The maki rolls were very large in size and required two or more bites per piece. The crab tasted quite fishy. The mango shrimp roll was a pleasant surprise. Sadly it was the only positive we found. The sushi pizza was awful and because we refused to eat it, we were charged 2$ for wasting food. The dessert offerings were pitiful. 

The price was a little higher than most other sushi AYCE places and definitely not worth it. Plus the food waste charge. We spent 60$ for 2 adults and 1 child. 

The service was mediocre. There were only two waitresses for the entire dining area. The restaurant was not busy yet it took along time to get seated and service. We did not receive all of the items we ordered and we did receive items that we did not order. Clearly some disorganization in the kitchen. They do not give you the little dishes to pour your soy sauce into either. 

Overall the restaurant was not the cleanest as evidence in the glass shelves behind the bar at the entrance. They were clouded with the haze of a thick layer of dust. Washrooms were not the cleanest but were acceptable for the most part. With how quiet it was in the restaurant I would of expected the washrooms to be nicer. 

Disappointed in our first and more than likely our only visit to this place."}
{"text":"Impressed! We were there for lunch and it had a great selection. The service was quick and polite. Love the decor, comfy leather booths and high ceilings with snazzy light fixtures.

I could eat their Cheese Wontons(AKA Crab Rangoon) all day, every day.  The maki rolls were huge! 6 pieces each, they didn't over do it on the rice, but the pieces were hard to eat without having a cheekful of sushi. I've had a lot of gyoza in my day, but these were more like breaded, deep-fried, dumpling shaped spring rolls. Delicious! Another dish worth trying is the Coconut Shrimp.

Usually desserts at AYCE restaurants aren't special; usually just ice cream and tempura banana. The ice cream is decent and there were small cakes too. The cakes were great! I expected them to be stale or dried out, but they were fresh and tasty.

It was nice to see an AYCE restaurant serving something other than the usual."}
{"text":"I went back here with three friends this time because we were craving sushi and this is the ONLY sushi place with in walking distance. it aggravates me so much how badly the quality in standard has dropped. They've always had a problem with their rice being to vinegary, I overlooked it because of the variety of items on the menu. Not this time, it tastes like the rice was just a seasoning to the vinegar! The salmon was fairly fresh, tuna, red snapper, and were way past their prime. The rice was very warm on the salmon and was so overpowering there may as well have been no fish at all! The servers can't speak a word of English and the service made the food taste worse. Literally, 25-35 minutes between rounds of sushi! It was outrageous, very, very disappointing. I complained several times but it seemed to make them go slower. They mixed up our orders and were inattentive. Furthermore, the chicken skewers were burnt, the squid balls are rancid, the sesame chicken was garlicy beyond being palatable, the desserts were horrible. Carrot cake that doesn't resemble a cake in flavor or texture, almond cookies that taste of extract, bitter green tea ice cream and bland red bean ice cream. My friends didn't even try the green tea and red bean, it would have been cool if the servers explained some of the etiquettes of sushi eating and pushed my friends to try some more adventurous ice cream options but it's hard to do that when you don't speak English! If you are ever desperate for sushi enough to go here, pay cash you get 15% off."}
{"text":"Prior to starting the review I must confess, I have never stepped into this restaurant.  All orders have been via delivery.  That said, I have a good baseline for sushi as I have enjoyed some great favourites from downtown Toronto - eat in and take out.  

Overall, I have not been disappointed however I would like a more punch of favour. After trying a number of the sushis that are available we have netted out on out favourites.  That said, dear owners, dial up the flavour a touch.  

The same is true with the apps. While the Goyza is vegetarian and deep fried (which is not what I am used to) it has some good texture.  I would just appreciate a touch more flavour (a consistent theme).  But I address with my homemade sauce.  The beef short ribs are tasty and have great texture.  Recommended.  The miso soup is forgettable and bland, don't worry about adding to your order.  This still disappoints me because this is one of my favourite parts of getting sushi because I love a good broth soup.

The sauces lack punch and flavour, so I generally make my own based on traditional recipes. 

All that said, I still order from Adora Sushi.  I still enjoy my meals.  I just choose wisely and still create my own sauces.

Oh, and I must mention.  The sizes are insane and they have great bonuses based on how much you order.  I always end up with a lot of food."}
{"text":"good sushi place. Servers need to smile a bit more. Not overly welcoming but the food is good. ."}
