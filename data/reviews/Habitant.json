{"text":"Habitant is located on the 2nd floor of Nordstrom in the middle of the ladies department. There is seating at the bar and also table seating. They have cocktails, beer and wine. The food menu is short (a subset of the Brazille restaurant's menu) but that makes ordering easy. Some of the items change often, so there's something new to try.  All dishes are prepared upstairs in Brazille.  Kung Pao Brussels Sprouts $10 - Nicely charred and extremely delicious. Cilantro Lime Chicken Tacos (4) $15 - These crunchy tacos were good, but pricey.  The menu says $7.50, but check your bill.  There's free wifi. Parking at the mall is free for the first 5 hours. ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"Set on the second floor of the Yorkdale Nordstroms location, this place can best be described as daycare for husbands and other fairweather mall shoppers.  The ambiance is what it is: you are sitting at an \"in-the-round\" bar amidst the women's clothing department.  Good for people watching, and certainly unconventional.  The make a kick-ass Bloody Caesar with hearty horseradish and maple candied bacon.  Perfect for noon.  The also make a winter sangria with desorono and pomegranate juice.  Different and refreshing  And there is food.  Good food, too.  Prepared in the upstairs restaurant- yes, there is another bar and restaurant on the third floor.  Nordstrom's is now my favourite department store.  Try the Ahi Tuna Poke.  Fresh, with crispy wontons.  Perfect snack size at 430 calories.  A couple of flat screen TVs and table seating too.   A DJ was spinning tunes throughout the store. A great new twist on department store shopping."}
{"text":"Update Visit.  Drink - Vine Street, Tito's Vodka based drink, very refreshing, great for a warm day.  A little fruity for me (I'm a bourbon drinker) but I decided to try something different.  Food - Chicken Tacos, 4 Four bite tacos that are delicious and not too heavy.  Ingredients are fresh and the shell crisp.              Fig and Jam Salad - Very fresh and the candied figs were a delight.    Service - Monika was attentive and provided navigation through the menu and to help compliment the meal with the drink mentioned above.    Give this place a try, you'll not be disappointed!"}
