{"text":"If I could give a 0 star review I would have. I never leave bad reviews anywhere because you can always find some redeeming qualities about a restaurant.  I specifically made an account to write this review because I hope people don't come here and waste their money.  I payed over $70 for a meal for my family. When we opened up the boxes the food was cold and appeared to be leftovers. The broccoli was old and had a sour taste. The biggest thing that threw it for me was the shrimp.  I bit into one piece of breaded shrimp and had an overwhelming taste of ammonia. If anyone has ever gotten food poisoning from shrimp it's because they weren't cleaned well and the bacteria upsets your stomach.  Best part is, when I call to complain about basically wasting $70 I get promises to be called back by the manager only to not receive a call, and to be advised that they do not give refunds.  What a load.  Please don't waste your money at this establishment. Worst Chinese food I have ever had."}
{"text":"I was a big fan pf the previous Asian Fusion that is now Pho Captain.   The mango salad is  excellent.  The rice had a burnt taste on our last two visits.  We ordered sweet and sour pork  but ended up with sweet and sour ribs.  I don't understand the burnt taste to the rice.  You will have to try it and find what you like. I am about to move out of Bolton so i doubt i would go back."}
{"text":"Prices are great considering this is not in a major urban center. The broth was flavourful and was definitely authentic. (No instant powder or pre-made garbage). Fresh noodles, beef brisket was great. Could have used a little more cilantro (or maybe have had it offered on the side with the very fresh bean sprouts that were provided). Also had some Pad Thai to go along with it. Was happy with that as well. Service was fast and friendly by the owner and the portion sizes were great. NOT too small, and not ridiculously oversized. MY spouse also enjoyed the Tom Yum that she ordered as well. WILL def go again!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came to have Pho and fresh rolls. The Pho is delicious and the portion was great. The broth was simple and the fresh rolls were a decent size to share between two people.   The service is good. The staff was really polite and welcoming. The place is really clean. My sister and I agreed that for Bolton, this place is GOOD. Any Pho lover would enjoy their soup.   I would not recommend their milk shakes, it's too icy, so you would probably get a brain freeze. Just stick to water or hot tea."}
{"text":"Decent pho served here with a well seasoned and spiced broth. I ordered the House Special Pho, which contains flank steak, brisket and beef meatballs. Lacking a bit in service though, as I had to ask for extra napkins and my water was never filled after I ran out."}
{"text":"Speed read: 1) Chinese food restaurant with a small Vietnamese offering. 2) Cantonese fried noodle (Noodle are soft and not crispy) 3) Don't waste your time and money.  I rarely give one star review especially in Bolton, as I should not compare small town food to big city food.   I didn't order pho, but ordered the Chinese food.  There's a different between Fusion and bad Chinese cooking. 1) Cantonese fried noodle that didn't have crispy noodle 2) Spicy chicken is not spicy, and look and taste like sweet and sour chicken 3) Shrimp with pineapple cashew has zero cashew, and we have to ask and they said they forgot.  The dish looks like it's make with the same ingredient as the Cantonese fried noodle. We didn't get too many shrimp either.  See the picture and decide for yourself.  I also don't appreciate the $3-$4 coffee.  There's a Starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"Since it is the only Pho place in Bolton it is worth going to save yourself 20 plus minutes just to satisfy your craving. Deep fried wontons are good and the pho soups are pretty good. Not amazing, but good enough if you want some soup quick and close to home. Service isn't great but the restaurant itself is clean and updated. Summer rolls are also very good. Reasonable prices as well. Definitely go try it for yourself."}
