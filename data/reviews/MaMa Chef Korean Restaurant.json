{"text":"As a Korean person who has tried Korean food all over the world, this restaurant is definitely at the bottom of my list. We ordered 5 different menu items, 4 of them being popular Korean dishes, and none of them were made properly. The jjangmyeon and kampoongee flavors were off. The jjangjangmyeon tasted like it was made from the instant packages, and the kampoongee tasted heavily like fish. In addition, the jampong had an excessive amount of red pepper flakes. Although this dish may not be Korean, the agedashi had TOO much batter. There was more batter than actual tofu. That's my mistake for getting that at a Korean restaurant.   I'm shocked that this place had 4 stars. Sometimes I shouldn't trust Yelp. Never coming back here. Ever. Not worth the $90 we paid. I wouldn't even eat here if someone offered to treat me.   Moreover, the waiter did not know what he was doing. He had us use the credit card machine, which he's supposed to do.   Maybe the cook was having an off day. Who knows. Try at your own risk. This is just the experience I had."}
{"text":"Noticed the bright new and kinda cool sign over the new restaurant and the lady making dumplings fresh in in the window as I walked by. Finally went for lunch. Impressed by the fresh veggies and tasty meat. Dumplings made fresh were flavorful. Service was friendly. Hope it does well as it's a bright spot in a sea of tired looking Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there on a lark. Food was wonderful, delicious, and flavorful. The service was on point. This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Koreatown is full of small restaurants serving their cultural dishes to all our delight, so it can be a bit disorienting deciding which place to go for dinner. My friend and I chose this place because of the cute sign and welcoming warm lights. When we entered we were greeted warmly. The décor was clean and displayed Korean music on the TV screen.   For allergy people, I understand the repetition of telling servers wherever you go about them as well as the fear if something goes wrong. I told the staff about them and I was really impressed and thankful for their consideration when they took it so seriously. They even followed up after the meal to make sure I was okay.   As for the food, it was delicious! I ordered the spicy chicken bibimbap. I loved how the rice was purple and served in the hot stone bowl of course. The place was pretty full but our dishes were served pretty quickly.   TL;DR  Cute place. Super caring staff. Yummy yummy food. Would highly recommend.  P.S. They pull out the credit card machine only if it's more than $20. I'm not sure for debit."}
{"text":"One of my go to korean restaurants with excellent service the ambianxe is quite cozy. The only thing is that they unfortunately dont take credit card but other than that its has great food with good prices."}
{"text":"I got the spicy chicken hot pot. I tried it first time in the city. It was amazing. I'll definitely come back with my buddies"}
{"text":"No idea how this got to be a 4 star, with all the other options in the area.  I could see it if it was the only Korean restaurant in some small town, but this is Koreatown, there are better options all around.  Service was fine, no problem there.  Sweet and sour pork was overcooked, wrapped in way too thick batter, sauce tasted of nothing but sugar.  Food court quality.  For close to 20 bucks for the dish, this is a hard no.  Side dishes were low in number and average in quality.  We got 4 in total, 2 of the 4 were just kimchi (one unfermented, one fermented), then you had a marinated potato dish and a tofu.  Meh.  Soon tofu stew was average - I found it oddly sour in flavour, not much in the way of veggies in it."}
{"text":"First things first, I am a Korean and this is NOT an authentic Korean interpretation of Jjajaangmyun (black bean noodle). It lacks the scorched black bean paste flavor and scent. Noodles are added into the bowl without being drained of liquid fully, making the sauce diluted. Veggies within the sauce has texture but lacks flavor.   I also had Kaanpoonggi (spicy fried chicken/boneless chunks). In Korea there are regulations on meat ratio to batter and very picky/sensitive eaters so the restaurants have to abide by the rules, but this place seemed like it was majority batter and 30-50% meat(still better than Korea House couple blocks down, 0-20% meat). Sauce had too much oil, as if the fried pieces of chicken weren't drained before being satayed in the sauce.   Only good thing about the restaurant was the server. Very friendly and honest."}
{"text":"There are only a handful of good korean spots downtown now (most have moved uptown).  This place is delicious (! !) And their service is great. Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"My favourite Korean place along this strip. They are always super nice and lots of side dishes. Everything I've had there was good. Don't miss their dumplings, mama chef pie or black bean noodles."}
{"text":"Mama must not be in the kitchen today. I`ve eaten at Ktown numerous of times, never had I said I will not return.  If you enjoy over seasoned food beyond explainable pallette, this is a place for you. Or if you happen to be sick, and have a dull taste bud.  Our table of 4 ordered Combo D which feeds 4 to 6 people.  First came the Jap chae. It had greens which I was impressed. All of us took a bit to try, and we all were wah. Super flavour. Not only rich in sesame, but black pepper. Lots and lots and lots of black pepper. Each 4 bites, we had to take a sip of tea.   Second came the beef boiled dumplings. Standard flavour, smaller then some I had. It was the best dish for the night.  Next came a chicken stir fried rice. They used they purple rice, was a bit wet and soggy. But it was edible. If you ever try stir frying rice out of the cooker with lots of condensation, you will understand the texture.  Next came the LA Kalbi. It came sizzling, it came black, it came charcoal. We all wanted to try to meat and took a bit. It was hard! Burnt bits crumbled in our mouth. The meat was tough and over cook it existence. We tried to send it back. The waiter said this is ordinary. The meat was so over seasoned and wet when grilled that the soya sauce just became grits and burnts on meat. I had never seen LA Kalbi disappear so slow on the table.. no one wants it. The cow died in vain.  Lastly came a kimchi pork sizzling dish. It sizzle nice, but very sour. It taste extra fermented and full of brine sourness. Imagine drinking a spoonful of pickle brine for fun. That's the flavour of the whole dish.  Our table was defeated. We pick out some pork and ate it. We lost our appetite.   To top it off, we had leftover refrigerated cold soggy pancake for compliment appetizers.  At least the guava candy tasted good.  Sorry mama. I will not be back. Even myself, I think my cooking tasted better"}
{"text":"Got the Tabletop BBQ. Meat quality was very good. Minimum 2 orders and you get 2 rice and 1 soup of your choice (took the tofu soup).   Remember to ask for the their hot sauce as well so good."}
{"text":"My friend and I always go here after our work shift and it's one of the places that is still open during the night time. We usually order the same food on the menu (pork bone soup and for my friend, kimchi soup) and everytime we came here the food is absolutely amazing! The waiters are very friendly too! They remember that I always ask for a fork and after two visits they already remember my request! Now that's 100% customer service :)"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Sometimes I dream about the food, thats how good it is. Great, friendly staff! The decor isn't anything special so its not the best place if you're looking for a particular \"ambiance\"."}
{"text":"Food: I got three dishes, 2 entrees and 1 dumplings. All of them are disappointing. The chicken and the pork were not well marinated and I could still taste that disgust smell of meat even they are all deep fried and covered with heavy sauce. They also only provide 4 kind of side dishes: pickled radish, pickled cucumber, potato and kimchi. Bland and nothing special.   Service: I read other yelpers' review about how good their waitresses are. Well, I think it depends on the waitress too. There were also other three tables with customers when I was dining there, two of them are charged by the other waitress, and the last table was with 5 people so I guess the waitresses have to share the responsibility. All of them got a great service by what I overheard. The waitress refilled their side dishes, notified them there will be extra waiting time before they placed the order, and even said \"thank you for your waiting\" when they brought the food to the large table. But my waitress....... I didn't get any water for the entire visit. First I thought she probably will bring it with my food then I just don't care anymore. She didn't ask how I like the food, and even cheap on candy at the last (like there were two candies on the tray when she brings the bill over, and when I just done my payment, she just put one on the table and walk away). I thought I was being a good customer: decide my order in 5 minutes, pay the 15% tip and don't ask her for any favour but well, o just can't have the second candy.  Anyways, the stars are mostly goes the the clean environment and the price. But probably won't go anymore. It's Korean town, there are tons of options."}
{"text":"??out of my expectations, the kimchi pancake is pretty good though. But the sides dishes are very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 8. Initially we were looking at this sketchy looking place across the street with minimal decor (literally, one empty room with a couple tables and chairs set up), but we couldn't find it on yelp so we ended up looking at mama chef.  After being greeted at the door, we were brought into a room in the back, which I presume is their storage area since there were bags upon bags of rice, pancake mix, and other ingredients. It was an interesting decision since there were tables of 4 next to each other that they could have sat us at, but they decided to go with the VIP experience.  Washrooms are in the basement, and not very accessible. They were pretty standard for a washroom in koreatown. Don't expect much there.  We were offered some side dishes, along with two whole pancakes! Which is pretty crazy, cause some other places usually give you a few pieces, and some places don't even provide any. And they were full-sized pancakes, so this is a good start. The pancakes were pretty good too.  There weren't many utensils in the box, so we had to ask for more, but it was quickly provided.  The menu features a variety of options such as fried cutlets of meat, dumplings, bibimbap, pork bone stew, fried rice in stone bowls, hot plates, and table BBQ.  I ordered the fried rice with chicken in a stone bowl. It comes with the sweet/spicy korean sauce, so if you can't handle spice you might want to avoid this one. I enjoyed the flavour, though I would have preferred more spicy and less sweet. Price a bit on the higher end, but I guess that's where the pancakes come in."}
{"text":"Only few measure of a good Korean restaurant. Pork bone soup was undercooked. Tofu soup and expired ingredients. And nearly impossible unless under horrible conditions, the Kimchi was expired. The cucumber Kimchi was just a cucumber in water. The servers are all confused as hell. They brought out the mains before the Kimchi and the rice much afterwards."}
{"text":"We went in after seeing the overall four star review.  The service was good, side dishes were sufficient, seating was comfortable but the two dishes we ordered were very disappointing: soft tofu soup with beef didn't have enough veggies and had a sour taste to it and the sweet and sour pork had a really thick breading and the pork was marinated with a bit too much pepper for my taste.  Tried better Korean restaurants in the same street."}
{"text":"Came here for jjajangmyun - I'm usually not able to finish an entire bowl of noodles but the food was so amazing, I literally ate everything ._."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in downtown Toronto so far. Big portions, excellent taste, not too pricey and very good service."}
{"text":"Amazing food with incredibly friendly service. When we crave Korean this is our go to place and it never disappoints.   Their ban chan varies each time we visit (I think they serve whatever their chef decides to make that week), but when they have it, they make this amazing medium firm tofu with red pepper sauce and potato pancake.   From their menu must orders are their seafood pancake (best I've had with a perfect crunch),  sweet and spicy fried fish (it's addictive as crack), bibimbap in hot stone bowl (I never liked bibimbap until I had it here, as the purple rice they use crisps so well and their veg perfectly complements their sauce. Note they don't skimp on quality veg - it comes with regular cabbage, purple cabbage, carrots, zucchini and spinach +++ for that), and their shrimp and chive dumplings.  We are still dreaming of their food.  Eat here - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So turns out \"Roll House\" is still in business, new owners though and their main specialty is no longer jajangmyun which upsets me and they focus more on the mandoo (dumplings), I guess to stay competitive with the Chinese dumpling place a few stores up the street. Me and two friends ordered...  3 orders of jajangmyun ($7.50 per bowl): Noodles were too watery like they weren't properly drained of the water that they were boiled in so they lost half a star there. The sauce was good, vegetables were chopped too big though, like I legit got a piece of onion that was the size of a half a banchan dish unbelievable. I don't know what they put in the black bean sauce but it was creamy, it had lots of meat so good on them.  Boiled shrimp & chive mandoo ($4.99): One order was 6 mandoo, they came out in two different colours, not sure why but I guess aesthetic purposes? Anyways, these were good and it seems like the restaurant's highly recommended. What I liked was how moist and juicy the filling is because some places make shrimp mandoo that comes out dry.    Cheese ddukbokki ($7.99): So one of my friends LOVES cheese to the point where I think she'll marry cheese, anyways, she wanted ddukbokki and of course cheese, so we ordered this. I didn't really eat much of it but it was good. The cheese helped neutralize the spiciness from the sauce but even the sauce wasn't that spicy or overwhelming, it had more sweetness to it.  Kimchi haemool pajeon ($9.99): I love pajeon so we had to get it, I actually like this one a lot more than Seoul's (theirs has been coming out more soggy and falls apart to easily) now. Perfectly balanced with the veggies, kimchi and seafood. Batter was nice and crisp. Pajeon didn't fall apart when picked up with the chopsticks.  Banchan (free): We were served bean sprouts, regular kimchi, pickled spicy cucumbers and pickled spicy cabbage stalks. They lost half a star for no danmuji (pickled yellow radish), like no one ever eats jajangmyun without it.   Overall our total was $51 something plus $3 tip, the damage was $54, which isn't too bad. I will continue to come here and eat their jajangmyun and possibly try more of their mandoo :D"}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh. Both servers seemed new and a bit lost but still very friendly."}
{"text":"Shared combo A with husband. The dumplings are small but tasty and colourful. The sirloin beef on hot plate was also very good specially combined with the banchan (little side dishes). Service was fast and super friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good but they didn't have the colorful dumplings I wanted. Decent home made style Korean comfort food!"}
{"text":"In korean town in bathurst/bloor. Place is small but was able to accomodate our group of 15.  Food is good. I love the beef bibimbap, dumpling no. 2 which is filled with beef and chap chae. The downside, not a lot of appetizer provided.   Staff are very nice and service is good"}
{"text":"First time here and we ordered Combo C ($39.99). Its recommended for 2-4 people (it was only two of us). Combo C came with the Spicy rice cakes, an option of sweet and sour chicken or spicy chicken, an option for spicy tofu soup, kimchi soup, or tofu soup, and lastly an order of jajangmyun. This is what we got. We also got a side of fried chive dumplings. Everything was great! I though the sweet and sour chicken would come with rice or the soup would come with rice but it didnt... wasnt sure if it was suppose to come and i just never got it. But regardless, this is my new go to spot for good korean food"}
{"text":"Solid flavours, attentive staff, good portions, and food served in a timely manner.  I got the Spicy Beef Brisket and Veg in Spicy Beef Broth - $10.99.  (It certainly wasn't brisket, more like slices, but at least everything was fresh.)  I did find it a bit on the salty side, as I usually find Korean stews, but it was fresh.  Bf ordered the bibimbap.  It was around $13 and portion was quite large.  He couldn't find it all!    Both dishes were serve with purple rice, which is supposed to be \"heathier\" than white rice.  Bachans were ok.  Nothing super special, but still appreciated.  All in all, it's a place worth revisiting in Koreatown!"}
{"text":"You people don't have a palate.  Regardless you are Korean or not, this cannot be one of those restaurants that you want to go for a decent food. If nice servers made you feel like you are eating a good food, You should go see a doctor.  From perspective of Korean, I should say something more harsh about the quality of food. However, I will try not to do so because it's ALREADY so bad.   It simply reminds of my first cook which I made when I was 13!!!!!!!! It's that bad."}
{"text":"Had the tabletop cooking. What can I day other then delicious. Wish they didn't charge for extra lettuce.  Soon tofu that it comes with was also incredibly  amazing!"}
{"text":"We came in a group of 15, reserved in advanced. Pleasantly surprised that they took reservations on a Saturday night.  We were seated altogether and the place has privacy dividers.   They give you complimentary appetizers like kimchi, tofu and potato pancake.   The advantage of being in a group is that you get to taste more food. I ordered Spicy Fried chicken and requested it be mild so that my son could have it. $18 for it seems pricey for me. It's good however it is not something I would order next time I come back. Spicy noodle with fish rice was good. Noodles cooked right and not overbearingly spicy. My husband liked the Mama chef pie.    My friends had sweet sour pork, bibimbap and japchae among others. Sweet and sour pork is nothing special. The bibimbap and japchae were tasty. I would probably order these next time I come back. The pork bone soup took unusuallly long to make.   Serving size is good to share between 2-3 people. Place looks clean. Prompt and polite service.   They accept credit cards."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurant, few minutes away from bathurst station and the food is superb with a very reasonable price. We ordered the combo C and we're amaze with the serving :) I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Get their spicy chicken hot pot (takes 20 mins, but worth it). Their pork katsu is also very good in portion and fried perfectly with great sauce and slaw on the side. Their savoury pancake is one of the best I've had a restaurant, crisp good batter and full of seafood. The beef fried dumpling was also good, little oily but it was delicious!   Definitely worth going into if you any well done authentic Korean food. Their kimchi isn't the best and there isn't too many side dishes but overall it's a great place to pig out and drink. Literally feel like I'll be full for the next few days!"}
{"text":"Service a little slow and the table top barbeque wasn't as good as korean village. For cheap eats in Koreatown i still prefer Sunrise across the street."}
{"text":"Good good,  great service!!! The pork bones hot pot was really yummy and the soup was so tasty! I like the jajang noodle here, the sweet and sour pork i didnt like too much. Both of these 2 plates come together and just 14$. This is an order for 1 person. U can order to try more many kind of dishes here.  This restaurant is very warm, shine, and they were very friendly with me.  Next time i will try the rice cake with cheese here!!"}
{"text":"As a die-heart Yelper, my partner and I were initially going to venture to more popular Korean restaurants based on Yelp reviews. However, due to the popularity of those locations, we decide to follow the path of least resistance, and found MaMa Chef Korean Restaurant. Different than the other, slightly more popular Korean restaurants in Korean Town, MaMa Chef Korean Restaurant was filled with Koreans. To me, this is a sign of authenticity!   The décor was clean. In the background was a television set with k-pop artists. I felt I was on a set of a stereotypical Korean drama.   Our meal was delicious. The Banchan (side dishes) was fresh and vibrant. Our entree was tofu bibimbap and kimchi stew with pork. Both items were served with a healthy dose of purple rice. Our bibimbap was filled with bright vegetables; carrot, zucchini, cabbage, bean sprout to name a few and a perfectly fried egg on top. I adored crispy rice at the bottom of a scorching hot stone bowl. The kimchi stew has a great amount of smokey flavour. It complimented the rice well.   There is something magical about Korean food on a cold winter day. MaMa Chef Korean Restaurant is definitely one of the better Korean restaurant in the area! I am glad we stumbled into it. Mama knows best!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Korean restaurant.  They have simple dishes such as beef and rice (bulgogi style) and udong noodle in the stone pot!  Always a good meal and they're green chive pancakes are delicious."}
