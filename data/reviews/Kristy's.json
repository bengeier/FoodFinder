{"text":"I can't believe anyone would have anything negative to say about this restaurant.  If you want good old fashion home cooking Kristy's is the place to go.  Skip the steak houses where you have to wait an hour for a table.  Kristy's steaks will beat any steak house...I am still curious on the seasonings they use that give the steaks that \"Extra Great\" taste. There are so many restaurants in Cleveland, but whenever it is my choice on where to go it is always Kristy's.  Double the star rating for this restaurant.  Can I give 10 stars?  Keep in mind though that this place is not real fancy, so if you want to spend a lot of money, you will have to go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"First time visit today while on the way to visit friends.  Great home cooked food-tasty and great variety-at very good prices.  It felt like I was in my family's dining room.  We all got different dishes and shared.  Everything was great!  My son's panini was delicious and my beef stroganoff over noodles was tender and flavorful.  My daughter-in-law's salad was fresh with a tasty dressing.  Wish we lived closer so we could try more of their dishes! This family owned and staffed spot was well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Typical pasta, steak and chicken place with less-than-typical execution.  Tried to substitute meatballs for the sausage that came with a dish. That was an issue (unresolved one at that)...... Had mixed vegetables instead of potatoes....can you say BUTTER?! Talk about missing the point. I started looking for the lobster to dip into this stuff...unfortunately they must have forgotten it....  I have to imagine the bar is maybe what keeps them in business at night because this one stop wasn't all that great.  Another bleh on the east side....."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood establishment that has been in business for many years. A large menu and full bar. Daily specials. My favorite is the snitzchel with potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Had the fish fry on a Friday during lent and it was good. They had a 75 y/o deejay this night so the music wasn't in my wheelhouse necessarily, but it was definitely entertaining for a couple hours. Service could improve, not very attentive."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place, a little kitschy but the food was good and the price was great. The schnitzel was very good and I liked the potato pancake and the big piece of broccoli. The place feels like it is half bar, and I didn't much enjoy drunk people at 2pm.  Definitely check it out though, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Visit Kristy's on a regular basis. Have enjoyed their corned beef dinner every St. Patrick's Day for many years. Their corned beef is ALWAYS lean and juicy. Served with boiled cabbage, potatoes and carrots. A side of rye bread and a cold one completes the perfect meal! Excellent.   Holiday decor and friendly staff always make for a comfy time."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in town with family we always make this a stop!  Friendly staff, full-bar and large menu make this a great place for 1, 2 or a large group!  They can have large parties in a separate room!  Fish Fry Friday is always great!"}
{"text":"They have the most tender veal schnitzels!  I always get them with extra brown gravy and extra applesauce for the potato pancakes.  Couple that with a glass of white zinfandel and you have a great meal!  Plus their bread is good too!  Nothing fancy, just a nice down home atmosphere and good food."}
