{"text":"Tried their pancake and cheese don katsu. Both were very delicious. Other korean restaurants will make better tasting pancakes but this one is not too shabby. Will definitely return for other items."}
{"text":"9.99 for an oversized chicken Katsu burger?? What could possibly go wrong. One of my go to restaurants to eat. Ingredients are fresh, you watch them as they make it right infront of you. Service is top notch as always every time I go. Place is always clean but with limited seating. Extremely hard to find parking sometimes. Usually people park at the gas station and walk right in."}
{"text":"Got the Don Katsu on rice w/coleslaw, the portion size was good, the meat was perfectly cooked but the sauce they used to dress the meat is way too sweet , paired with the sweet coleslaw it almost becomes a bit overpowering .   I haven't tried the burger yet but it is something I will be back for . Will update my review when I do so!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Would recommend. I would like to go back for their taro chips and ice cream."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent service here. Can't think of any place better. Genuine nice people.  Food will fill you up. Large portion. Ask for the siracha mayo. Makes it extra better."}
{"text":"Really nice little place.   We ordered chicken Katsu burger and donkatsu ramen noodle and purple yam soft serve ice cream.   Chicken burger was soo nice and juicy and it's huge for a burger.   I usually don't eat pork but I tried their donkatsu and it doesn't have the taste and smell most pork had. It's really sweet and juicy. Pretty decent.   Purple yam ice cream is really nice dessert for the end of meal.   5/5 for the food.   The wait time tho it's a bit too long for a burger joint. It had only one sided table facing window. Thus lots take out orders. But there is only two ppl (including cashier/server). There were two groups of ppl in front of us and we waited an hour and half for our food.  And parking as many mentioned, it's really tight and I had to park to the other plaza nearby and walked to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good Katsu.  The Don Katsu burger is a great value.   Very interesting and tasty seaweed chips. Very friendly staff.  ++"}
{"text":"Really tasty katsus and bulgogis.  We had it to go!  Sometimes, a small menu is all one needs to perfect the dishes.   Will be back to try other items. Tad on the pricier side though...."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt the best piece of fried chicken I have ever eaten. Stop what you are doing and go here immediately. The owner and staff are lovely too"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here multiple times and I've tried everything except for the ice cream on the menu.   Our first time here, we were shocked with the small menu but easily blown away by the hospitality. Since we were taking some time to decide what to eat, the girl working offered us some fresh taro chips. I thought that was a nice gesture.   One time we were deciding between the two choices of Gyoza and the staff were nice enough to make half of each for us to try.   They are so sweet and kind. The food is generous and of good value.   The only downside is the small parking lot, but the food and service make up for it :)"}
{"text":"First off, this is a really small spot. Great for 1 to 2 people at max, or just do take out. There's probably 8 bar stools at the bar available by the windowside.   Food is absolutely delicious and the portion is huge ! Definitely worth the money. I ordered the Don katsu burger. The katsu was fried perfectly. Not dry but perfectly flakey and it just breaks up in your mouth. It came with a side of coleslaw as well which was good as well.  They make fresh taro chips everyday in house and they put a sprinkle of seaweed on it. Such an interesting but delicious twist. Must try ! Only $2.99 a bag  Would recommend for everyone to try. And I would definitely go back !"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken I have ever had. It took us three tries until we finally made it to a time they were open but it was defiantly worth it! The noodles were average but the burger and the Katsu chicken was amazing.  Also their taro chips are amazing as well. They are not ordinary chips, the way the flavours are layered is amazing!  Would go again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is located at the southeast corner of Kennedy and Steeles in an offbeat strip plaza.  There is very limited parking and the lot is small... if you drive in and don't find a spot, it may be a challenge to get out.  Having said that, it is well worth trouble.  We ordered the Chicken Katsu burger and Don Katsu on rice.  Both excellent!!    Everything is freshly made.  The meat is individually coated only after the order is placed and then deep fried.  The coating is very light and crispy and not oily tasting.  The chicken burger was quite large.  I would say the piece of chicken was 3 times the width of the bun.  Fresh lettuce, tomatoes and 2 types of sauce topped the burger.  This also came with a small side of slaw.  The pork serving size was also very large.  Rice was moist and sticky.  Extra sauce was provided as there was so much pork.   Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. Food was great and staff very friendly.  There were 3 people manning the place and everything was cooked calmly and smoothly even when it got really busy."}
{"text":"Overall: 5 stars, y'all gotta try this place. A fusion of flavours to delight the senses! It used to be big moe's burgers, but this is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood!  Food: My first time here. I heard good things about the chicken katsu burger.. so that's what I tried. Wow. That katsu to bun ratio is exactly my kind of burger. They fry the katsu fresh to order right in front of the eyes. The finished product was huge and the meat was juicy. The bun was fresh and soft with sesame seed speckled on top. The burger came with slaw and a very nice salad dressing that made the burger taste wonderful. The extra katsu that spilled out the side, I ate with a fork and knife. The side of coleslaw also goes very well on top of the katsu lol.   Service: The lady at the front smiled at me and noticed how confused I was. She made the standard recommendations and was super friendly about it. The back staff were also very happy and gave me a warm goodbye when I left. Bar seating is pretty much like it was when it was big moe's burgers. Also, the food comes out quickly and hot!  Parking: Bit of a tough place to get limited parking when it's busy. There's two spots for parallel parking in the back. Otherwise it can also hard to turn left into the lot if you're coming from north of Steeles. I haven't been in a situation to need to park at pacific mall and walk over, but I feel like that's a possibility if the lot is crammed.   Overall: This restaurant is just so nice on a few different levels. It has a comfortable and welcoming vibe to it. I'll be back to try the bulgogi burger next."}
{"text":"I took my chicken katsu burger to-go and now feel the urge to hop back in my car and drive to the restaurant, just so I can thank the cook for making one of the best burgers I've ever had! I also would probably pick up another meal (or two!) while I'm there ;)"}
{"text":"Hunting for interesting eats near the Delta East, and this one piqued my interest. Ordered the Don Katsu burger ... I was prepared for a massive burger, but this thing was hilariously huge, crispy (even after the drive back to the hotel) and not at all greasy. The slaw added a nice bit of tang to the sandwich as well. Looking forward to going back and trying the pancake in the not-too-distant future!"}
{"text":"They were sold out of taro chips when I went but their don katsu burger (chicken) was amazing.  The don katsu was crisp and huge!  I had to eat the katsu with a fork and knife before I could start eating it as a burger which I do not mind at all."}
{"text":"Staff were nice and friendly.  I had the pork katsu burger. I thought it was quite good although I didn't find it as life changing as a lot of people think - but it's huge and tasty.  Also had the Ube ice cream which is novel but I thought average tasting, and I also felt like there must be a crazy amount of food colouring in it since it's so radio-active purple, and same with the macha. If you go to youtube and look a people who make ube ice cream with actual ube it doesn't turn out that purple.  It's all good food for good value, with huge portions and good service so all good in my book."}
{"text":"Probably one of my go to places for katsu around the area. The service is great and the portions are good enough for me to get full off one dish. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a modern Korean take on katsu."}
{"text":"Small place, not much seating, parking is limited so just be ready for that. Food itself was good, big portions, price not too bad."}
{"text":"How can the girl that works here be so cheerful and welcoming?!! She lifts up my spirits every time I call and come in to pick up my food!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot with great food! Workers are really nice and friendly just an overall great experience."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last month and really like the food. The katsu burger is huge and the meat is very crispy and tasty. Took my whole family last Saturday and everyone enjoyed their food. Parking and seating are both limited but it is still well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wow. Eating the chicken katsu burger was a spiritual trip. Definitely one of my favourite places to go for lunch now! Be prepared to get take-out since there are about 10 seats and a constant stream of customers. Besides the glorious chicken, the customer service was stellar - considering how busy they usually are. New fav!!"}
{"text":"Super great food for the price! The amount they give is way more than you would think. I got the don katsu rice and it came with 2 large cutlets, rice, and a salad (which was like coleslaw). The cutlets were fried perfectly which very good quality meat and very juicy. My friends got the don katsu burger which was also a very large piece of cutlet between a burger, it had spicy mayo sauce (which they were really nice to ask the level of spicyness), pickles, tomatoes, lettuce. Super friendly staff there. Also tried the match ice cream, it is less on the creamy side, wanted to try their yam ice cream but it was already sold out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and friendly service.   Prices are fair for the insane portions you get and the food is delicious. Definitely worth multiple visits."}
{"text":"Drove by Fat Ninja Bite many times and always said to myself...self, we need to check this place out. Well today I did , went with my daughter and son. As soon as we entered we where greeted with a warm welcome from very friendly staff...everyone was smiling , a very friendly atmosphere. I ordered two chicken Katsu burgers . My order was processed very quickly and we could see how the cook was preparing our meal right in front of us. As the order was finished we could hardly wait to dive right in....wait hold on I said. We need to take some pictures first.lol. All I can say is the chicken katsu burgers were on point. Very juicy, moist and crunchy . Very nice presentation, big portion and the spicy mayo was an extra nice element.For a big burger it was not heavy at all . I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unreal value! I always get the chicken katsu with rice and the portion could feed me for two meals - about $10. Always cooked to perfection and ready in under 20 minutes. The only thing is that the parking lot for this plaza is insanely small and difficult to get in and out of so take-out is more ideal."}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review for this.  The portion size is huge. One order served two of us. Be careful the drinks you order. I ordered  a small green tea drink from a can and maybe it was imported but it ended being $3.50.  Like many places it was good but I was not blown away. I would come back but it is not high on my priority list for must try again. I basically know I'll get decent food but I'll probably hunt for something really inspiring or unique elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me tell you - I hate burgers so I was very hesitant to try this place.   However I tried the Chicken Katsu burger (dark meat) and it was amazing! I actually finished the whole thing!  We also ordered the taro chips (which are a MUST) and a side of kimchi coleslaw (also really good). My boyfriend ordered the Pork Katsu burger. I did prefer the chicken over the pork as I found the meat a little bit dry.  This place is pretty small and busy, so there's not a lot of space to sit down to eat in but they were super nice and they brought out extra chairs for us so I can't really complain....   Overall for first impressions, I would definitely come back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"After passing by Fat Ninja Bite several times, I decided to try it even though getting in and out of the small plaza looked hard. However, it wasn't and I am glad that I actually got the guts to go and try it out.   Everything about my experience from the food to the service is what made me give this restaurant 5 stars. This small Korean/Japanese restaurant has limited seating, as it is meant to be a to go or take out restaurant.   Food:  I went with my family and we got...  Chicken Katsu Burger: This was our favourite item there. The chicken is coated with their own homemade panko bread crumbs. The chicken was so juicy and tender and the outside was deep fried to perfection. All the flavours went very well together. Just as a heads up the burger is huge and well worth the price!  Chicken Katsu Rice: Basically the same thing as the Chicken Katsu Burger but with rice instead. It was delicious too however we preferred the burger version better.  Bulgogi Stir Fried Noodles: The bulgogi was delicious but it didn't wow us as much as the chicken did. However, it was still good and didn't disappoint. The noodles tasted similar to udon in terms of the texture.   Taro Chips: They make their taro chips everyday in the morning and season it with pink Himalayan salt, seaweed and other seasonings. Very delicious, crispy, and fresh!   Ube (Purple Yam) Soft Serve: The soft serve was very creamy and tasty. The yam flavour isn't that strong and goes well with the Rice Krispie like cereal at the bottom.  Matcha Soft Serve: The soft serve is creamy and tasty as well. The matcha flavour is very rich but I found it to be a little on the sweeter side. Comes with two green tea Pocky sticks and more cereal.  Service: Let me start off by saying that the service here was impeccable. The lady at the cash register was very nice and was always smiling. She knew the menu very well and would always check in to see if the food was good. She also told us that everything they make from the panko bread crumbs to taro chips are all homemade.   Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Greeted when you come in and thanked when you leave. The food is excellent and has a prominent wow factor--the chicken katsu burger's chicken portion is triple the size of the bun. Delicious too. Reasonably priced.   I even inquired about their taro chips and she offered me a small bag to try free of charge! I bring all my friends here to try and they are all impressed. You gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"AVG at best. Can't really Ness up deep friend stuff.. wouldn't go again. Not bad not good"}
{"text":"I drove here for the third time from the north york area in bayview/yonge and Sheppard area, in a blizzard yet again. There are hundreds of tonkatsu places in my area, and me being Japanese and growing up eating it, I think I know a great tonkatsu place when I find one. Did I mention I drove through a blizzard? I am not sure if they are on Uber eats, but they definitely should be, but customers should be aware that after a car ride the katsu will not be crispy as when you eat it in on the counter in the restaurant.  Before you drive home, take a quick bite after you get in your car, and you will see what I mean. Regardless all the meals are so tasty. I always get the meals with rice. 9-11 bucks. I love the katsu and Bulgogi which has some crunchy cabbage in it which is great for texture instead of all soft meat. I buy extra so that I can have food for lunch the next day and because it is a far drive for me. I also stock up on as many bags of taro chips as they can sell me. There is a limit of how many you can buy because they want to make sure there is enough for All customers and someone like me who buys ten bags can take that away from someone else. I would call ahead.  I cannot believe how little the cost for food is here. In my area you can't get anything for less than ten bucks. The dark chicken and pork katsu have so much flavour.  Most Korean places make the katsu so thin, this place makes it perfect in my opinion.  I cannot imagine anyone complaining and if they do they should try buying food in my area.  I also need to mention how friendly ALL the staff is here. The cute Korean girl remembered me, and other details, smart girl. I am coming back. I ate a bag of the taro chips for breakfast with my coffee and having Bulgogi for lunch that I bought last night. Thank you! See you soon."}
{"text":"Location is a bit hidden.  Very limited parking.  The restaurant is very small.  More of a takeout place as it only has about 9 seats along the window.  The menu board doesn't really reflect all the options they offer.  The takeout leaflet shows more details, however, it still doesn't reflect all.  Basic things like the price for drinks is nowhere to be found.  Don Katsu burger- the meat looks huge after it is flattened, but the bun is small so the meat looks even larger.  I found the meat on it's own needed some seasoning, but in the burger with all the sauce and toppings, it compensated for that shortfall.  Bulgogi burger - OK.  Nothing exceptional.    Service - Friendly enough.  Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite is a super small restaurant that serves absolutely huge pieces of pork and chicken katsu. You can either get it on a burger or on rice, both of which will fill you up and doesn't break the bank. You can see everything being made in front of you which is always nice and the katsu was super tender. Make sure you ask for extra Japanese mayo if you're a fan (let's be real who isn't) and they'll kindly abide! I've only been once but will definitely be coming back soon! Would recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch earlier. Parking is difficult with limited spaces in a tight lot. The space is small and the menu is limited, but everything we tried was delicious. The chicken katsu was the star.... Really flavorful and well fried. And the amount of meat was extremely generous. The kimchi slaw was also outstanding.... Spicy but not too much. Service was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The parking lot is pretty tiny at this plaza. Came during a weekend around 1pm and once we saw cars reversing towards Kennedy we decided to park down the street at another plaza and walk.   There were a few people waiting for their orders when we walked in. Decided to try the chicken katsu burger and the bulgogi rice.   I noticed they make the Katsu to order. They do not pre batter the chicken to fry which it why the wait times are a little longer (10 minutes for the order) But the wait was well worth it. The Katsu was crispy yet light at the same time. And the size was huge! Also came with a side of coleslaw.   The bulgogi was good but nothing really to rave about.   Really wanted to try the soft serve but didn't get a change. Will come back to try the pork katsu next time!"}
{"text":"Fat ninja promised a lot with their lovely food pictures and highly rated reviews but we felt it wasn't overly as impressive as others did.   It would've scored a higher rating if the price matched the food. Good portions for one but $9.99 for okay noodles?...a little steep for that. I can only comment on the noodles as we had the pork katsu soup noodle and the chicken katsu fried noodle. The noodles are much tastier fried than in soup. They had a better consistency when fried and held a lot of flavour compared to the soup form. The broth was nice though and I believe it is fish base. I prefer the chicken katsu over the pork as it was nicely fried and not dry at all. However I would've preferred if they salted the meat slightly before putting that great in house made bread crumb on top.  The staff is incredibly nice. I felt it was family owned and while we were dinning (ate there) they would occasionally ask us how we were doing. Granted we were the only customers but a nice gesture give that it is a burger joint.  Would try a burger next time but not the noodle again.  P.s. Parking in this plaza is a nightmare and it won't get any better."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always amazing! I am always greeted with a smile and the workers there are really friendly!   I always order the bulgogi burger and it never disappoints! I prefer the garlic chipotle sauce when I get my burger! The taro chips are also always a great addition and they come with your order of the bulgogi burger! It is definately very filling for one person! I wouldn't recommend sharing one unless you have a smaller appetite or just want to have a snack!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Katsu, the taro ice cream and chips are delicious.  Very very friendly staff, have been back multiple times and the customer service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. If you're into trying smth new, give this a try. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I suppose it has novelty appeal but it doesn't do anything particularly great. The pork katsu is nice and big but does it really work as a \"burger\"? Not convinced. The Korean pancake is okay but you can get that anywhere..and far better. The matcha and taro soft cream is only OK (at best). It's not the worst way to drop $40 on fast food, nor is it the best. Not by a long shot. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"We came here after reading all the Yelp reviews . Fat ninja bite is a hidden gem ! It's tucked in the corner of Kennedy and steels. They serve burger, rice, and noodle dishes. We ordered a kimchi slaw + chicken burger + cheese burger. The size of their patties is huge !   The burgers were delicious and filling ! The price point for the burgers is very reasonable. We have tried many burger places in Toronto, and I must say that this is one of the top joints in Toronto."}
{"text":"*This review is based on the catering service that we had done for my sister's birthday!  We got a tray of chicken katsu and their coleslaw. They gave us a plentiful amount of sauces, including spicy mayo, garlic mayo, and the original. Our guests loved it, they were satisfied and kept coming back for seconds. The chicken was a good balance between crispy and tender!  The customer service is super friendly and efficient. Will definitely go back again, for catering or a quick meal."}
{"text":"My brothers and I were looking to try something new and came across the highly rated Fat Ninja Bite on Yelp. We drove all the way from Willowdale, and it was well worth the trip. We ordered the chicken katsu burger. I warn you: the meal will not be healthy but the quality is out of this world! Highly recommend!   The location could be better -- it's hidden behind Petro Canada just south of Kennedy and Steeles. I'm paying it forward and helping to expose this hidden gem."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST KATSU EVER!!  We ordered a chicken katsu (dark meat) burger, a don katsu (pork) with rice, and seafood noodles. The katsu comes with a side of coleslaw.  Chicken Katsu Burger: The katsu was three times the size of the burger! Probably the biggest katsu you will ever see! The chicken was breaded very well - not too thick or thin. This was the crunchiest katsu I ever had! The chicken was also very juicy and tender.   Don Katsu Rice: Unlike chicken katsu burger (served on a tray), the don katsu rice was served in a styrofoam take-out box. When something as hot as the katsu is put into styrofoam, the foam will break down, which I saw a bit of at the bottom. Nonetheless the katsu was also very crispy and well breaded. The pork was quite tough, not quite as good as the chicken.   Seafood Noodles: We wanted something besides katsu, so we ordered the seafood noodles (they also have bulgogi noodles). The noodles were very thick and chewy - my favourite type of noodles. The toppings were fish balls (various types), mussels, shrimp, squid, and octopus. Quite a bit for such a small bowl!   Things to keep in mind: - There are only around 15 parking spots in this plaza. I recommend parking at Pacific Mall then walking over. - This place is more for take-out as there's only a few seats available. Be prepared to wait if you want to dine-in. - Bring an empty stomach! The portions are HUGE! More than enough for two people."}
{"text":"This used to be where Big Moe's Burger was located right across Pacific Mall. One burger joint replaced a burger joint and I must say this is much better!   I'll start of with the negatives. The parking at this location is not very good. There's a few restaurants here in this tiny plaza and it can park probably 20 cars at most. The second thing is that it takes time to cook this burger, so if you're in hurry make sure you call ahead! The last thing is the seating here is not that great. If you're looking for a spot to chat and hang out, this is not the place. It's more of a dine and get out or pick and go joint.   The portions here are huge! I ordered 2 chicken katsu burgers. One was white meat and one was dark meat. The difference in the two was minimal. I would suggest saving your $2 and stick with the dark meat since the white meat costs more. The burger was delicious! I don't even like burgers and this place really impressed me! The meat was juicy, never dry and the sauce was perfect. This is definitely different than all the other burgers I've had before. All burger orders come with a side of co slaw. There was nothing really special about that, but even without the regular side fires the burger itself was more than filling enough. I would highly recommend getting a bag of taro chips! It looks like they are pre-made and comes in little baggies. These chips are out of this world! Nothing I've had before! I would certainly go back to get just the taro chips!  Overall, I would recommend giving this a try. It's certainly worth your money! The taro chips are a must and the staff were also friendly so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Hands on,  one of my favourites! Delicious pork and chicken cutlet. Great customer service and friendly staff.   Ordered  Don katau stir fry udon Chicken katsu burger  Taro chips  They were accomodating to my food allergies.  Beware of parking.  I just Park next to plaza just south and walk over."}
{"text":"This place deserves rave reviews. This chicken sandwich was unbelievably huge and full of flavour. I took it to go and it was still crispy and oh so tasty! I also tried a sample of the sweet potato/green tea soft serve and it was amazing!! I will return."}
{"text":"I bought the chicken katsu burger. It was pretty decent, although it didn't wow me. I feel that the sauce may be lacking in flavour as I was craving for something more flavourful. The taro chips didn't do the justice either, although it was a decent snack."}
{"text":"Must Try: Katsu Dark Meat Burger (!!!), Ice Cream Twist and/or Parfait   Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, ( 10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:   Been coming here religiously since it opened, and two things are certain: #1 amazing fresh quality Katsu Burgers and #2 a giant smile and great service from Sunny!  The first time I ordered the Katsu Burger, I was shocked at the size of chicken I was receiving. It LITERALLY spilled out the side of the buns. The next thing was realizing how delicious it was. I personally always go with the Dark Meat option, but that's personal preference. Aside from the delicious, fresh katsu burger, there other menu items are always delicious.   What really sets Fat Ninja Bite apart from other katsu places, is the quality of meat and the freshness of the dish. Everything is made to order (which sometimes means a bit of a wait) which means your order is as fresh as possible.   The only downside is that seating here is not expansive, with only row of seats across a window. If you're coming with a large group, seating will be a bit difficult. However, smaller groups and couples shouldn't have much problem as the turn over is fairly quick.   I don't often go five-for-five in a rating, so when I do, y'all know it's going down!"}
{"text":"No regrets! A bit skeptical at first because it`s just a burger after all. And this place is quite far from where I live.But my curiousity and seeing yummy pictures are really tempting. So here we come, ordered chicken katsu. It's HUGE. The katsu is tender (best i have ever had) and long (it`s sticking out of the bun on both sides). After we left, I checked out the website to see more details for the menu. Turn out there is spicy cheese katsu. Definitely will come back to try that one AND the ice cream."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and the chicken Katsura don with dark meat is delish. Crispy, juicy, omnomnom it's good. The katsu burger is also very good but Im attempting to look more elegant and \"lady like\", cause with the size of that burger... it's not possible. I dare you to look elegant eating a burger. Only issue I had was sometimes I am unable to find a seat ): but I always come back for some delish katsu!"}
{"text":"Truly one of the cleanest places I have been to. The staff is very friendly .  They don't accept credit card which is okay.    their food is absolutely delicious. I pretty much got everything from their menu and you can't go wrong with anything they offer. Make sure you get their ice cream too. Their Don katsu burger is one of the best I have ever tried. The parking is ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE. it's one way-1 lane and it's TIGHT. You can't turn or Make a 3 point turn ...And don't even bother going to the end of the parking lot ."}
{"text":"Holy shit. Where have you been all my life?!  We were in Scarborough and yelped nearby restaurants. This has been far the best yelp find! For comparison, I find this better than Holy Chuck, Garbardine, and Kandahar Kebobs.  We ordered the katsu chicken burger and bulgogi burger, and bought the taro chips. The katsu was sooooo juicy and beautifully crisped. And they give you TWO katsus! One in between two soft buns with creamy mayoesque sauce and the other is on the side of your tray.  My boyfriend ordered the bulgogi burger. It was also tasty but he said he'd order the chicken katsu next time. ;)  Taro chips are made in house. Not oily and tiny seaweed pieces on top for salt taste. So good that we got another bag lol.  Be advised that parking spaces are limited and the seating is just one long table against the window and maybe 8 stools. We went on a Sat at like 2:45pm and snagged two seats easily.  Anyways, we're totally coming back! *drool*"}
{"text":"I came with my girlfriend one day after seeing all the good reviews. I ordered the chicken katsu burger while my girlfriend ordered the classic korean pancake. They were both very tasty and will deff come back and try it again.  The price of the burger was 8.99. Very nice price for the huge burger you get. The service was very nice and look like they care for their customers."}
{"text":"My roommate and I often come to this joint when we feel like grabbing a quick bite for dinner or their parfait for dessert. The inside doesn't have a lot of space and has limited seats so it's not really a long-time seating place for catching up with an old friend on busier days, but it's great if you wanna grab something fast, eat and go. Sometimes you'll luck out with seats though.  The Katsu cutlet is nice and crunchy. I've tried their Katsu and bulgogi burgers and all of them were really good. Their veggie chips are really good too, they sit by the cash register. You seriously can't go wrong with the food here. My roommate and I love the parfait too.   Parking is sometimes tough because the plaza is tiny so I'd recommend to park somewhere else nearby and walk here. It's worth it though. Great joint."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around 7 and was surprised to find it wasn't line-up busy yet.  Very glad cause there's very few parking spots at the back and a row of stools by the window.   We ordered the Korean dumplings; chicken katsu burger; and ube and Macha soft serve; and 2 can drinks. Came up to like $24. More than enough for the 2 of us.   I was expecting the katsu to be heavy but it was nice and light and not heavily battered!  I reaaaaally liked our meal! We didn't come early enough for the chips, or had enough room to eat the seafood pancake. So we're gonna come back FOR MORE!!   If you come early enough drive over to Pacific mall and walk off all that goodness! Hehehe"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place to go when I want a quick grab and go! I always call the store to place my order, and it takes between 10-20 minutes depending on how busy they are. I never have issues with parking but I know it is quite limited. The portions are huuuge, so you really get your money's worth!  I've tried the chicken katsu burger and rice, both are soo delicious. The burger gets messy because it's so massive, so I always go with the rice instead!   You definitely have to try this place if you haven't already! Amazing food, portions and staff!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of katsu... until now. I've always thought katsu was basically breaded chicken fingers 2.0, what's so special about it? Fat Ninja Bite makes it unique for me because the batter is light and crispy, almost tempura like. I loved how the texture was perfectly crunchy while still keeping the chicken juicy on the inside. I got the Katsu Burger (white meat) and it was so good . I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Tried chicken katsu stir fry and it was amazing. Can't wait to try the burger and ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Don Katsu  Burger (deep fried pork burger) The don katsu is huge, a large piece of meat inside the burger. You will need a fork and a knife to eat this burger. Too big for me to hold on the burger and eat it, especially in the beginning. It tastes good with the mayonnaise sauce and the Japanese don katsu sauce.  Green Tea Ice Cream It has rice (from the rice crispy) at the bottom of the ice cream cup. The green tea ice cream is ok, I would enjoy it more if the taste of the green tea is stronger. Nevertheless, it is not too bad.   I will come back for the burger if I am super hungry."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars because the food was awesome but the place needs a lot of work.  Food: best katsu I've had since Japan.  Huge portion size.  Freshly fried to order.  Impressive presentation as well with the burger.  Taro chips were delicious, the seaweed bits gives it a special flavour.  Soft serve ice cream was great as well. Service was friendly.  Place: extremely small and communal.  I counted a total of around 10 spots only, and seating is along a counter facing the window or 1 table facing the kitchen.  Seating is elbow to elbow tight, not comfortable at all.  Worst part is that it was a Super Hot day out and the air con was not suffucient.  You get breezes of hot air from the open door, then a slight wisp of air con on your back.  The ventilation system looks really old.  Parking was also very tight and limited.  I'm conflicted about coming back.  Food was impressive but the comfort was lacking.  Thought of take out, but not sure if the cutlets would still be crispy.  Maybe the solution is to come on cooler days during odd hours."}
{"text":"The owner is so friendly and so smiley. I walked in to pick up my take out and I just felt so welcomed. The food is so good, we got the chicken katsu stir fry noodle and chicken katsu rice. SO GOOD. Remmeber to get the garlic mayo on the side for the chicken"}
{"text":"I've seen them on social media multiple times but never occurred to me to come by and try it until recently.  We ordered a chicken katsu burger (dark meat) and a pork katsu burger. No one warned us about the portion, they are seriously huge and delicious - although I prefer the chicken over the pork. Price is great for what you're getting, the people are incredibly nice, seating is limited and does get stuffy when the weather warms up.  Would definitely recommend this place and return!"}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite is a totally no frills, super cute, amazing katsu place!!!! For around $10 you can get a gigantic piece of katsu that comically is way larger than the bun, fried fresh and pairs really well with the burger toppings. I felt it was totally worth it and was content and full afterwards. I really liked their coleslaw as well! We had the chicken katsu burgers (dark meat) and it was super yummy!  We saw pictures of the ice cream from other Yelp reviews and had to have some! That day they were serving green tea soft serve (soooooo good) with rice crispies and two pretty pocky sticks on top. Totally worth my $3.50.  Things to keep in mind: it is best as a take out dish, especially in the summer. I'm not sure if it was just the day I was there but the AC was not on and it was boiling in there. There are only around 12 seats inside but it wasn't busy at all when we went on a weekday night. I knew this going in so I really didn't mind - thankfully I brought a cold bottle of water with me and they sell refrigerated drinks there.  Overall I loved this place! I am definitely going back again :)"}
{"text":"Don't go to Markham hardly ever, but I will definitely come back to this spot next time I'm in the area.  I ordered the chicken Katsu burger and probably the best fried chicken I've had.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating, I didn't feel rushed like I do in many takeout style restos, and staff was quick to answer any questions.  The chicken was huge, you could probably order some rice and have another meal w/the extra chicken around the bun!  The price was average, about 15$ per order because Hst.  But thanks to the liberals everything is now expensive."}
{"text":"Meal is worth for the price, however, the teriyaki sauce that is on the Katsu is on the sweet side. We got both the chicken and the pork Katsu and let me tell you chicken Katsu was much better than the pork. It had much better flavour and texture than the pork."}
{"text":"We got chicken katsu on rice and don Katsu burger. Love the menu - they have ice cream and Korean pancakes as well! I like how they have an option for white meat and dark meat. Their portions are quite big especially for the Katsu burger. Both meals are delicious! The staff are friendly and the place is clean. Limited seating though but we went after lunch so it wasn't that busy. :)"}
{"text":"Oh man what a great surprise this was.  My family are here last night and in spite of its unappealing presentation And location the food was outstanding.  Specifically the pork and chicken Katzu burgers' were amazingly flavorful AND huge. Im not an eloquent writer - obviously- but Damn if this wasn't my favorite meal in Toronto.   So the parking isn't very good. The one 8 top counter faces a gas station. The joint is in a strip shopping center.  Three strikes in most cases. The food turned it into a grand slam home run   Oh and before I forget - the dumplings.  Try the dumplings. They are divine."}
{"text":"Great quality don Katsu for the price. I've tried the chicken and pork which were crispy on the outside and  tender on the inside  Sides also always fresh. Only down fall is the delivery is o my available through Skip the dishes and their service is horrible - never received my food one evening and they still charged me. I tried calling but never recieved a response from a manager."}
{"text":"Small venue with tasty food for the money spent and large portions on the protein!  Service : friendly staff & helpful.  Drinks : Canned Iced teas (Nestea tall can and Arizona are overpriced over most places ($2.50 a can).  They have a new Canada Dry Ginger Ale I have never seen before : Blackberry Ginger Ale, it is from the Coca Cola family of beverages.  Food : If you enjoy Pork or Chicken Katsu don this is the place to hit up.  Super large portions for the money you spend.  My wife and I ordered the Chicken and Pork Katsu don on rice.  We enjoyed it much, but we were not able to finish it had to take the leftovers home.  Katsu don anywhere else will fall short against what Fat Ninja Bite offers.  Since the Katsu is cooked at the time of ordering the breading is really crispy.  Tho they add sauce when served with rice so the crispy breading becomes soft if not eaten quickly.  Note for Gout sufferers : If cabbage is one of your triggers, you can ask at the counter while ordering to substitute the coleslaw that comes with the Katsu don and rice offering for extra rice.  On a side note, my wife enjoyed the coleslaw *sighs*   As for me beef is a trigger so I have to completely shy away from any beef dishes.  Venue : small dining area not much seating.  Parking is a pain since the parking area is small, the parking area gets packed easily and quickly.  Worse case if you're having a Katsu don craving is to park at Pacific Mall and walk.  Definitely worth repeat visit for the awesome Chicken/Pork Katsu Don on rice/noodles/bun.  Happy Eating!!"}
{"text":"This place is small but cozy.  The menu is small but the food are good. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and just wanna try their deep fried chicken and they didn't disappoint me at all!  The price is alright but consider the amount of food you get then it's not bad;  they give a big piece of chicken in the Burger!!!!  The only downside is the parking which is not their fault due to the lack of space there. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Their chicken katsu is so bomb, must try! Juicy on the inside and super crispy on the outside. The tonkatsu sauce drizzled on top is so delicious I wish they had it on the side to dip :P Pork katsu was not bad too, however I'd pick the chicken over it just because the chicken is more tender and juicy. Taro chips were also good, very addicting but oily. Overall a pretty good experience, great service, fairly quick and big portions imo. I love how they make it on the spot so everything is freshly cooked. Would love to try their seafood pancake and bulgogi next time."}
{"text":"Many times I've had Katsu disappoint me. Katsuya, local Korean resto, izakayas...dry and hard after a few bites. Not FAT NINJA BITE.   For $10 you can get a huge piece of katsu - watch as the meat is dipped in batter and fried to order. Juicy, and crispy I haven't had better katsu.   I had the katsu chicken burger, and I folded the katsu to make a triple decker chicken burger, with slaw and pickles. Ask for the sauces on the side, I had a spicy mayo and another white creamy sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious! The portions are huge too. We ordered a chicken katsu burger, and a fish burger - both were amazing! We also ordered the 10 dumplings with hot sauce and found it a bit hard in terms of texture because of the deep fried dumpling skin, but had good flavour. The kimchi slaw is nothing extraordinary - simply kimchi mixed with some coleslaw. Definitely worth visiting and trying it out. BUT also worth mentioning - parking is a nightmare. Very tiny parking lot."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the katsu burger!   Friendly staffs, menu is simple but delicious. Basically a take out place as only a few bar stools are available."}
{"text":"super good food for a pretty good price!! had the katsu on rice and it was the best i'd had in a while. it's a great place to come after exploring pacific mall since it's right across the street."}
{"text":"Location/Service It's located right across pacific mall, beside the PetroCanada station.  Parking is very limited as it's more of a takeout place.  There's additional parking at the church a bit down or probably park at pacific mall would be another choice.  Inside it's a small restaurant with around 5-6 seats.  Staff are very helpful in explaining the different menu items and which ones are particularly popular.   Food I ordered the Chicken Katsu Burger.  It's made on the spot, so it does take a little time (or even more when there's a lot of orders to fulfill).   Very well done - the cutlet was extremely huge, almost twice the size of the burger.  It is messy to eat, but I love the idea (plus there are some cutlery available).  The chicken was still soft on the inside and the batter was at a minimum to not feel overly fried.  There's the standard katsu sauce inside the burger - so it's too dry.  I would definitely come back to try their chips and ice-cream, which I heard pretty good reviews from it."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGGGG. I was so very satisfied after eating my bulgogi burger. Just be warned that it's def messy, but 100% worth it!   I also tried a bit of the chicken Katsu and it was perfectly breaded, perfectly crunchy and still soft."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after hearing a lot of good reviews about this place. The menu is fairly simple with variation of pork or chicken for the meat. The servers were very nice and friendly and asked us how the food was and even helped take our trays. The place is very clean with limited seating. I ordered the chicken katsu noodle in soup ($10) and taro chips ($3). Taro chips were very delicious but it doesn't taste any different from regular taro chips that you can get at Chinese grocery stores. The chicken katsu came on a separate plate and was not submerged in the noodle soup so it would preserve the crisp.  The flavour for the chicken katsu noodle soup was just ok. The flavour was not something too out of the ordinary for the price. Probably would not come back again."}
{"text":"Service and food were equally great. I tried the pork Don Katsu burger, I recommend it"}
{"text":"I probably should take a point off for horrible parking conditions and skimpy amount of seating, but the katsu sandwiches are SO GOOD I can't not give this place 5 stars. Make sure you only visit there when I'm not going to be there, cause I don't want you in my way. Staff are super friendly every time, and did I mention the sandwiches are amazing? The chicken breast is juicy and melts in your mouth. The panko breading is light and delicious, like a deep-fried cloud. Love the sauce, too! The buns are delicious and so fresh, with a degree of softness that barely survives the eating. The taro chips are really nice, but a bit pricey. Hope they open up more locations with the same goodness."}
{"text":"Where have you been all this time?? This is exactly what Markham needed. Delicious Chicken katsu.   I tried the burger chicken Katsu that's crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The slaw is fresh and crisp and complements the crunchy deep fried burger perfectly. The mayo definitely ties it all together:  The rice is delicious and topped with toasted sesame seeds.   The scallion Korean pancake is the oh so good and probably the only vegetarian thing on the menu. Seriously it's packed with onions and flavour and so delicious!   To top it all off, friendly staff and cooks who serve you with smiles.  The only thing is that seating is limited. But that's okay. It's seriously so good. And definitely a great addition to Markham's food scene!"}
{"text":"So what can I say about this place? I went in with a friend expecting a typical burger but you end up getting a neat fusion of east meets west. The lady at the counter was very sweet when we ordered.  I ordered the katsu burger which was a huge pork katsudon on a nice bun. My friend got a chicken katsu burger which was also impressive. We also ordered a Korean pancake which was good as well. Afterwards we ordered their Ice cream parfait which was also good. I've never had a swirl of green tea and taro ice cream and I can say for sure I'm a fan. It's a cool little joint that I'd recommend anyone trying at least once."}
{"text":"Limited food items on the menu and decided to get the chicken Katsu burger after seeing pictures and seeing other people ordering it. The workers were very welcoming as soon as we entered, the only thing is there were very few seats and the place was pretty busy. The portion size for the burger was huge and the chicken itself was pretty large it could not fit all in the burger. The chicken was nice and crispy and also came with coleslaw on the side.This is the place to go if you want a meal that will fill you up, and I'd recommend trying their burgers!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  Was on my 'to eat' list for a long while and finally I have found the time to go there to give it a try. Given the reviews, I had high expectations going into the meal. However, it was a pretty overrated from my perspective. We ordered the don katsu burger and the chicken katsu noodle soup.   The katsu for the burger was massive and literally spanned more than double the width of the actual bun and the toppings were stacked up very high. As such, it made it quite a messy experience and very impractical to eat. The katsu crust was not bad but eventually became soggy due to the dressing that was in the burger. The pork itself was super lean so it was somewhat on the drier side. The bun could have been toasted instead of being left the way it is, as it came out a bit cold.   The noodle soup was just alright, nothing to write home about.  Service was great and welcoming as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the pork and chicken are cooked really well, tasty and fresh. Nothing to complain and the only recommendations is to give customer a cup of water with the meal."}
{"text":"Great little Korean mom and pop shop tucked in the corner behind Petro Gas station (On Kennedy and South of Steeles or where Big Moe's use to be) Parking is limited but there's more at the back. If your familiar with the area, than you know there's a lot of traffic during rush hour. My advice is going during non peak hours. I went around 4ish pm and had no problem with traffic and parking. Also had the shop all to ourselves (seats are limited, only bar table with stools for seating of 6 to 8 people)  We ordered 3 different Katsu on the menu and they were all delicious. The Katsu was made to perfection with the meat lightly battered which came out crispy and moist. The sauce compliment perfectly without overpowering the Katsu. The meals were inexpensive and came with coleslaw on the side.   The owner gave us taro chips on the house. It was crispy and flavourful. Not like the supermarket taro chips, if you like those than you have to try these! It's made daily with hemililiyan salt, japanese dry season, and garnished with seaweed. They sell these on the side indivdually where you can purchase them to go.   For first timers, the Chicken Katsu burger is the BOMB.com and a MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"I came with open expectations and I was blown away! I order the dark meat chicken burger and it was insane! First off after being deep fried the chicken hung to the side. I didn't know how to even approach it, until i ripped the sides of the chicken and man I was blown away! I grabbed a coke on the side and the coleslaw on the side was enough. I'm super full and in case you want more there is a sushi joint next door."}
{"text":"For what it is, Ninja Bites is an easy five stars - it's high quality fast food and it's sooooo good!!! The menu is pretty small but everything is done so well.  We tried a cheesy don katsu and chicken katsu, one on rice and one with noodles. The portions were generous and everything was cooked quickly and perfectly. We had the potato croquettes with spicy mayo - also delicious.  The best came last though with the homemade black sesame ice cream - get it in a cone and you're given rice krispy treats and poke sticks - it's the little things!   The place is tiny and not the most amazing location but the food and super friendly staff easily make up for it!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty tucked away. Not a lot of parking spots available but the food they offer is quite good. Can have chicken or pork Katsu in a burger, with rice or udon. I had their pork, cook to order which is great hot and fresh. Pork was very tender. I also their their green tea and purple yam ice cream twist. Had it in a cup and came with rice crispy which I found a bit odd but I didn't mind the crunch. Definitely would go back to try more menu items"}
{"text":"The katsu was super krispy.  Food is great, but the parking sucks and the seating is limited.  I'd recommend getting it to go."}
{"text":"OMG! There is something magical going on here!   The feature on the menu is definitely their Katsu Burgers. And lemme tell they are a sight and taste to behold. First off, the burger has an enormous katsu in it, that extends beyond the burger borders. With the topping, especially the slaw, it all came together for an amazing mesh of flavours. To improve though, I would have been happy to pay a little extra for a nicer bun. They currently use a regular soft burger bun, but it would have been tied together nicely on maybe a firmer bun!  Unfortunately, the parking lot is an absolute nightmare. Was able to get into the lot, but there weren't any spots. It was hell to turn the car around as well, as there wasn't enough space for two cars to even go in opposite directions. Luckily I found a spot on my way out, but would maybe recommend parking elsewhere and walking over (maybe the gas station?).   The price was extremely reasonable as well, with the whole burger at just $8.99. I HIGHLY recommend this spot, but maybe find a better spot to park..."}
{"text":"Better than Katsu at Donburi that's for sure.  Portions are big, great customer service, friendly staff. Should definite try if you haven't.  It's a small place and because everything is fried on order it takes some time to make. If you see a lot of people be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"The name is a bit cheesy, which put me off for a bit. No need to take life so seriously though, so I gave it a go.  I had the chicken katsu burger. I didn't see this from the pictures, but there are actually two HUGE pieces of katsu. The woman working there said \"I hope you're hungry.\" I thought it looked big with just one slice, but two?! Just by looking at it I knew I would eventually have to fork-and-knife it like a civilized person. I got about halfway through with hands only, and then it got messy.  My favourite type of burger.  The katsu was done to perfection, but just to fit with my own tastes I will ask if they can make it spicy next time. All I could think about the whole time was that I would love to spread Gochujang all over the burger and call it a day. It was a tad on the bland side. I can see how having Gochujang as a side condiment would get expensive for the owner, so any type of hot sauce would be nice. I would have preferred a bit more veggies with all that meat, but I think they didn't want to make the burger TOO big. I could fit my mouth around it, but if they add an extra slice of tomato or extra pickles it would be quite difficult. If you're a pickle lover, ask for more pickles, because you don't get much.  They had thin coleslaw on the burger to give it extra crunch. I loved that. Their coleslaw on the burger and on the side (a thicker cut coleslaw) were both phenomenal. It was still a bit safe. They can throw a spice in there to give it a kick. I loved that it was fresh and crunchy, though. Most places just phone it in with their coleslaw, but Fat Ninja Bite does not. I didn't mean to write an entire paragraph about slaw..........  All in all, I really enjoyed this place and would go back again. It is quite pricey and they could be more adventurous in their seasoning, but other than that they do a lot of things very well."}
{"text":"Only echoing what others have said already about this place, and that is the katsu!  I've been eating katsu all my life growing up, and this place ranks up there with some of the best in terms of juiciness, flavour, and size!    I opted for the chicken katsu burger with dark meat.  Was genuinely surprised that the katsu burger was the size it was, but I guess for $10 it had to be that big.  Very lightly and thin-coated, keeping the meat juicy and crispy.    Staff were nice and friendly.  Limited parking, but the plaza is small and does not seem very busy.  Located across Pacific Mall, next to the Petro Canada gas station.  Definitely worth a stop for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I came back a second time to try the chicken katsu burger and it was absolutely delicious, definitely worth the price since the burger was HUGE! This place is worth trying out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The food here is to die for. Crispy pork chop. Huge portion. The price is defini right. The matcha ice cream was good too. The only thing is that there varely any seat to eat."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious! I didn't have high expectations from such a small place, but I was thoroughly impressed. I shared their udon with chicken katsu and pork katsu burger with a friend. The katsu was overflowing out of the bun and filled with cabbage and sauces. It was so yummy! It also came with coleslaw on the side and it's probably one of my favourite coleslaws I've had to date. The udon was super hot which I love and it wasn't too watery or salty. It was just right. The shiitake mushrooms in it are super sweet and there was the perfect amount of cabbage and carrot to noodles. Their taro chips are also sooo addicting. Make sure to grab a bag of these when u visit. I have already been back and will continue to keep coming here to fulfill my tonkatsu cravings."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a coworker and we were the second people in line when they opened at 11:30am on a Friday. The place has maybe 10 seats that fill up FAST.   You order at the counter and get your meals in maybe 10 minutes. The chicken katsu is GIGANTIC, but somehow  I managed to finish it all. It's delicious and impossibly crispy. I ordered it on the side with noodle soup, which was a bit disappointing as I found the soup a little thin. It was a veggie soup, maybe that's why.   I'll definitely come back, though I may call in my order ahead to avoid the wait, and get the katsu on rice."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife last week and it was fantastic . Just took my brother here for lunch today and we both really liked it. Great place."}
{"text":"Love their Katsu Burger! The Katsu is bigger than the size of you hand palm, and there are 2 pieces of it! I would say if you are a small eater, you can share 1 order with another person. The Katsu is cook just right, very tender and juicy. The breadcrumbs is super crispy - I read they make it fresh everyday! With the fresh tomato, lettuce and the coleslaw, everything is just amazing and delicious. The only issue is that it's a small place and limited parking, but who cares, I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The white meat chicken sandwich is so good with the crisp batter and the spicy mayo is delicious. I would eat here once a month."}
{"text":"Had this for dinner ordered the katsu and chicken burger. I much preferred the chicken one because it had more juice within it. It was freshly done so everything was crispy and warm which I enjoyed. It was two big pieces so for sure you would be very full.   I also had the seafood pancake and ordered a side of taro chips a bit salty for me but I did enjoy it. I highly recommend the seafood pancake it had clams, octopus and squid as well as shrimp. They were all made on the spot so very fresh."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite is a tiny restaurant located south of p mall. It maybe tiny but  it is definitely a gem! Their menu is simple, you basically just have to choose pork or chicken with rice or noodle or in a burger. They also offer four side dishes and ice cream for dessert. My friend and I ordered pork katsudon, chicken katsudon and takoyaki to share. Both the pork and chicken katsu were tasted amazing, crispy yet juicy. What I like about their katsu is they were not oily at all. Between the two I would prefer the chicken as It was more tender. The size of the pork/chicken was huge, I struggled to finish it. The takoyaki were great. The outside was firmly baked, the inside was soft with the prefect amount of filling. There were taro chips samples at the cashier. They were seasoned with seaweed, very interesting taste. Wanted to get a bag, which is only $2.99, but knowing the size of the pork/chicken we decided not to this time. Overall we had a great experience here, will definitely come back to try other items on the menu specially their ice cream.   * Pork Katsu with rice * $8.99  * Chicken Katsu with rice (white meat)* $10.99 * Takoyaki * $5.99  Follow me on IG @eatwithJoT for more!!"}
{"text":"That was a meal of epic proportions. I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!! I can't hold back my excitement because I'm going to start recommending this place to everyone I know. I had the chicken katsu burger and unffff, I think it just topped the charts for the best burger I've ever had.  LARGE, SUCCULENT, JUICY chicken deep fried in a LIGHT, CRISPY batter drizzled in all sorts of SWEET, CREAMY teriyaki and mayo sauces complemented by CRUNCHY, FRESH coleslaw, lettuce, and pickles and finally sandwiched between a FLUFFY, SOFT sesame bun. What more can I say?? Have I sold you on it yet?!  I am still in awe of how delicious that burger was. I'm super full and content now :) The girl who works there was also very nice in helping me choose their store's best seller. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was quite full (yay!) after having the katsu burger which came with a small side coleslaw. A cute little spot, but not the best for parking. Definitely park right in front of the shop if you can. It is more of an in-and-out place. Curious to try the seafood pancake and maybe the bulgogi - we will see! Great prices, great service and I can see myself coming back. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have not been here personally, but my brother brought me what he couldn't finish (half a burger).   Wow this was delicious.   The chicken katsu is cooked very well.   Fried perfectly and really juicy chicken on the inside.  The sauce and flavour is on point.     I am definitely going to have to go here and try more items on the menu.   This was a really good burger"}
{"text":"This place used to be big moe's and now turning into \"Fat Ninja Bite\".  I heard lots of positive comment about this place before I came. I ordered the cheese don katsu on rice and it was good!  Rice: just the right texture. Chewy but not too hard and slimy. Love it.  Katsu: crispy outside and juicy inside. it was a perfect match with their house made coleslaw.  The wait time was a bit long but reasonable because they make it as you order it. The staff was very friendly. Recently saw people posted the taro ice cream from this place, I will return later."}
{"text":"The hype is real!  Walked in 3pm after the lunch rush and the staff welcomed me in as though i was the first customer of the day- as others walked in after me. That is just how they greet people. So feels good!  I had a bit of an expectation from previous yelp reviews on what the item would look like but what blew me away was how delicious it was.  They even offered me their spicy mayo as I told them i like it spicy. Complimented the cutlet perfectly. I ordered the katsu chicken burger btw!  Don't miss out on this place. It's a must!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! I love this place so much more than big Moe's. I've eaten here with my boyfriend 3-4x already since they opened and it is SO DELISH!!! They don't cheap out on portions at all and I love their taro chips!   I wish they had kimchi fries or bulgogi fries since they have most of the ingredients to make it, they just need fries :D. I'm so excited for their takoyaki to come out though. Try this place if you haven't already! Huge DELICIOUS portions and at a cheap price too."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with the food here! Whether it be the Katsu on rice or katsu burger, Fat Ninja Bite is delicious!  Their portions are very generous and the fried chicken or pork is very well done. It is not too oily and they have a good ratio of meat to carbs to veggies.  I definitely recommend the katsu rice for a more traditional take on katsu don. If you're feeling adventurous, the katsu burger is also quite delicious."}
{"text":"The bulgogi and katsu burgers here are so tasty! Bulgogi is amazing, they blow torch it to perfection and the beef is so juicy. Perfect blend of cabbage, pickle and mayo makes this the perfect fusion style burger.  You can't go wrong with the katsu burgers either! Panko crusted and fried to perfection, not oily and tender yet still crispy. So so good. I see why the line up never ends and there is and endless flow of customers.   Couple things to note: the parking situation here sucks. There are maybe 10 spots in this \"plaza\". Also, seating inside the restaurant is extremely limited to about 8-10 super cramped barstool seats facing the window. Definitely not kid friendly. However the food is so good this is easy to overlook"}
{"text":"I ordered the katsu burger with cheese ($10.99) and it comes with creamy coleslaw on the side. I really enjoyed this burger as it was not oily or dry. It's a big burger with a big piece of tender don katsu held between soft sesame buns. The don katsu was breaded and fried nicely. The crunchy slaw in the burger was dressed in a thousand island type of dressing that wasn't overpowering. I liked the katsu dressing that was lightly drizzled on top of the don katsu, giving the burger a good savoury flavour. The cheese in between the don katsu doesn't make a big difference in flavour, the burger is still tasty without it. I would skip the cheese next time and order the regular katsu burger 5/5 burger  Their taro chips are addicting! Seasoned with nori and salt and are made fresh daily.   Their ube soft serve has good flavour but the ube flavour is not very strong. You can taste the vanilla base of the soft serve and the ube flavour is quite subtle. The colour of the soft serve is quite pretty and the combination with the rice krispies at the bottom is really yummy!  Their other food like noodles are decent but it doesn't stand out like their katsu burger.   Great service, the cashier is very friendly and even gave us a sample of their taro chips when we were there. This is more of a take out spot since there is only around 8~ seats available."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Katsu joint in the Markham area. Perhaps one can be not picky by saying it is in Scarborough which is technically is, however with it being so close to the Markham border I will classify it as such.  Food: Generous portion of Chicken or Pork Katsu you will get around. Execution is good however I personally substitute their slaw given with just shredded cabbage I personally found it a bit overwhelming and I like to stick with the classic style of eating Katsu.   The Katsu burgers are quite overwhelming in size but who am I complaining to, it's worth the price.   Service: Staff is friendly and helpful. Not much to say it's a fast food takeout joint. You can opt to dine in but again you order at the counter and that's about it.   Ambiance: Place is clean with very limited seating. Diner style... Didn't really change from when it was Big Moe's so the seating layout is the same.  Recommendation: Be a shame to not checkout this place considering the fact that proper fried Katsu is relatively dry in Markham. Highly recommended establishment of your unwilling to travel to North York or the downtown core."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite is open every day for lunch and dinner and closed on Tuesdays.  They are located on Kennedy Road near Steeles Avenue, at the corner where the Petro gas station is and also conveniently located across from Pacific Mall.  You can't miss it!  However, when you go there, you will have to try your luck at getting a parking spot because their parking lot is very tiny (unless of course you are walking or taking public transit to get there)!  During the busy lunch or dinner hours, you may want to just park across the street at Pacific Mall's parking lot and walk over.  In fact, this is what B had to do because when she arrived, there were no more spots left.  I arrived at 1 p.m. first and like others have noted in reviews, there are only eight spots for dine-in at a long table with stools facing the parking lot.  However, the space inside was very bright, clean, and spacious.  Immediately when I walked in, Sunny, the owner/staff of the establishment welcomed me with a cheery \"Hi!\"  The bag of Taro Chips was much talked about on instagram and was $3 per bag.  They were quite good (and addicting)!  This was definitely the best Chicken Katsu Burger that I've ever had. The Chicken Katsu was breaded lightly and fried perfectly to a crisp yet its meat was so tender and juicy and perfectly flavoured. It was amazing. The Chicken Katsu, as you can see from the photo, was so large that it extended beyond the size of the burger and across the table. It was monstrous for sure!    This Chicken Katsu Burger came with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and cabbage and there was a side of coleslaw on the side.  It tasted so good with these toppings and the sauce was the perfect amount too.  The coleslaw was very crunchy and fresh with just the right amount of tarty dressing.  Again, all around amazing!  The Don Katsu Stir Fried Noodles (you could order this in soup too) contained a plate of Don Katsu and a rectangular container of stir fried udon with vegetables (carrots and cabbage).  The Don Katsu was also perfectly breaded and fried here but I thought that the chicken katsu tasted better in terms of being more smooth and tender.  The pork was a little more coarse for me but I still thought it was one of the better katsus out there.  To my surprise, the stir fried udon was also really tasty.  Although it looked so ordinary, the udon noodles were smooth and firm and had just enough sauce to cover each strand and the veggies.  It was a good portion as well.  We came hungry so we definitely finished everything even though the portions were so generous.  I believe that if I had arrived any other day, I might not have finished everything by myself.  For dessert, the flavour of the day was sweet potato soft serve so once it was prepared, Sunny brought the dessert out to us.  It was a Sweet Potato Soft Serve Parfait that looked so nice with perfectly swirled soft serve ice cream, copious amounts of Rice Krispies on the bottom, and matcha and chocolate Pocky sticks to top it off.  The texture, look, and consistency of the soft serve reminded me of the soft serve at Wooffles & Cream being that it was very smooth, didn't melt easily, and tasted very creamy.  There was a little bit of sweet potato flavour but not very strong.  We thought it tasted a little vanilla-y too.  However, I really still really enjoyed it.  I liked the ice cream's smoothness, creaminess, and slight sweetness.  The Rice Krispies at the bottom of the cup were a wonderful addition of crunchiness to the dessert too.  Overall, a really satisfying dessert!"}
{"text":"The best Korean food I've had in a while! Flavours are excellent (recommend the beef with rice or noodles), and the meat is cooked very nicely (not dry and doesn't rely on sauce for flavour). Friendly staff. However, parking there is sometimes hard (very limited spaces), honestly I recommend parking at pacific mall and walking over. I'd give it 5 stars for food, and 3 stars for location. But cmon you're REALLY only going there for the food!"}
{"text":"An amazing little Asian burger/rice/noodle place. There's no tables just counter seating. I found this place on Yelp looking for a burger joint. Their burgers are not your typical beef burgers. Their burgers are panko crusted pork or chicken topped the gherkins, cabbage and two sauces, teriyaki and mayo type sauces. I tried the Don Katsu burger. Calling it huge is an understatement. The thing was the size of my foot. And it was delicious. It was crunchy, because of the cabbage and panko crust, juicy and filling. I hope to try their other offerings soon.  This place is a must try."}
{"text":"I have seriously been living under a rock. I recently discovered this place (through yelp of course) after making a trip to Pacific mall. If I could have the chicken katsu burger everyday and not gain a single pound, I would. I would highly recommend the chicken katsu burger, or just the chicken katsu on it's on (if you're looking to cut calories).   The only downside is the location - parking here is terrible and crowded."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and one day Id like to try their whole menu! Ive had the pork katsu burger, chicken katsu burger, taro chips and soft serve ice cream. The katsu burgers are juicy and made to order -- the wait time is a little bit long so don't come here in a rush. I really like how everything is made fresh and they truly care about the quality of their food.   The taro chips are good too, nicely salted with seaweed topping. The soft serve is delicioussss, I prefered the matcha more than the purple yam. I wish she didnt put so much rice krispie cereal though. Although adding a nice texture, it was just too much at the bottom.   Overall, its a great joint with friendly employees that are dedicated to making great food!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I ordered the Chicken Katsu burger (dark meat) which came to around $10 after tax. The katsu is huge that it hangs out the sides of the burger. It comes with coleslaw on the side which was absolutely delicious! The katsu itself was light and crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. It did not feel or taste oily at all. Not to mention that the staff are super friendly as well! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Parking was impossible but once we got our food, it was worth the parking lot troubles.   The portion of the pork katsu was generous was well battered. The coleslaw that came with it was kinda of weird though - the cabbage was cut rather large and unevenly, which made it take bitter.  The potato croquet was your typical grocery store freezer box croquets. I took them home and added some bulldog sauce to spruce it up a bit."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN KATSU. The end. They deserve all 5 stars for this piece of perfection - the batter is not too thick, it is fried to a nice crisp, and the chicken inside is still kept juicy and tender! Their portion size is SO generous and you don't feel greasy after eating the entire thing. This place needs to be awarded with a Katsu Trophy if there ever is a thing like that. My dad ordered the white meat chicken katsu for $2 extra and I ordered the dark meat, there really wasn't much difference in terms of taste so I'd say just stick to the dark. I would also definitely go with the rice next time instead of the noodles because the soup was pretty plain. However, I am giving this place 4 (and a half) stars because my mom ordered the Bulgogi noodles which fell short as the sauce was a bit too sweet for her liking."}
{"text":"Finally came to try this place because of the great reviews.  Having tried all 4 katsus, I think that the chicken katsu burger is the only thing that I would return for.  The don katsu is really dry and after a few bites it becomes too much.  The only saving grace is the slaw and sauce on the burger.  Same with the cheese don katsu, it was too lean and dry.  The fried noodles were a bit on the sweet side and are just udon noodles.  We also got 2 bags of the infamous taro chips, they were good not fantastic.  There are lots of other fried veggie chips out there that are just as good.  The wait time is also pretty long, around 20 minutes, because the meats are all fried fresh to order.  Overall, I would come back and order the chicken katsu burger(dark meat) again but I would give the don katsu a miss.  We parked at the far south west corner of the Pacific Mall parking lot and walked across to the store."}
{"text":"This is where big mole burger used to be. I decided to try the chicken Katsu. I love how they breaded the chicken, it didn't tasty oily at all and  bread crumbs. The stir fried udon was mediocre, can use more flavour.  They discontinued the wedding noodle. We also tried the pork katsu burger. The katsu was huge.  It is very authentic Korean food.   I see this guy ordering platter of burgers and taro chips. Great idea for ordering something diffeeenr for parties. Will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!!!  Came here for lunch.  Got the Katsu burger. The meat was bigger then my face!   Very tender and juicy.  Definitely come back and try their other ones."}
{"text":"First time here after multiple friends talked about it. Came here on a Saturday night around 7 and parking was a mess - it's super cramped, but if you're lucky you might just find a spot.  Ordered a tonkatsu burger and a Korean  (original) pancake. Both were so ridiculously delicious I wish I could have had more. There's coleslaw and cabbage in the burger that gives it a good crunch, and a small pickle that goes extremely well with the fried pork. You should try both the chicken and pork to see which one you prefer. The Korean pancake is one of the best I've ever had, the edges were super crispy and the dipping sauce added another dimension to the dish. Be careful about the metal tray it comes on because it can get pretty hot.   Tried the ice cream cup afterwards as well - preferred the ube (similar to the taro bbt flavour) over the matcha. They stick in Pocky sticks and serve it over a bed of Rice Krispies. So simple, but so good!  They get 5/5 because it's certainly worth a try and I wouldn't hesitate coming back here for another meal. The staff are friendly and accommodating (eg. If you need a burger cut in half for example, after you take pictures for Instagram...), and if you stand by the counter you can see them prepare their katsu on the spot. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The burger was sooooo good, and excellent value! You get a huge piece of meat thats double the size of the burger, and all ingredients tasted fresh. The people who work here are also really nice and passionate about their food. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wow may i say i am obsessed with the Taro chips !!! Omg the best thing ever !   Tried their :  Katsu burger  Takoyaki  Stir fried udon  Katsu chicken    Honestly it was quite good ! I would def come back and just get katsu pork with rice. I thought the pork was better than chicken because it was tender and juicy in comparison. The stir fried udon is not that great and the soft serve ice cream didnt really taste like ice cream lol if you want really good soft serve try woofles n cream !"}
{"text":"Very tasty katsu offerings. Crisp is perfect, the chicken katsu burger was enormous. If there is one issue I have it's that they don't seem to season the food after frying it, it's missing salt at least for me."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant visit here. Friendly greetings from passionate staff. Great space, good food, good portions. Don't really have anything to complain about.  I specifically came here to try the unique concept of sticking a katsu into your traditional burger to replace the burger + infusing it with Jap/Korean-style flavours. I had the delight of trying the Cheese Don Katsu burger and the Chicken katsu burger (both $10.99). About a 10 min wait because they're made to order. But the wait was worth it because, my oh my, those cutlets are HUGE! My bf's chicken katsu burger actually came with two cutlets! He had to take one out otherwise he wouldn't have been able to place it in his mouth! I was curious to see how my cheese don katsu was made, so I sliced it in half; the cheesy goodness oozed out without fail. The cutlets are mentionable: big and very crispy. The rest, not so much (slaw, sauce, bun).   I like that they're open late for my late-night hungers (late-openers in this neighbourhood are a high demand, by me). Their noodles/rice menu looks ok, their ice cream looks like it's worth a try. Since I'm a quanTity-over-quaLity type of person, I'm definitely back for a second helping of chicken katsu burger if it comes with two cutlets!  (PS. I found myself comparing this cutlet to 'Hot Star' across the street in Pmall. If I were to pick, I'd probably choose here. You're paying about the same price w/ the same wait (and prob the same parking issues, lol), and this one comes with more carbs! Sure, you're giving up some spices and crispness from Hot Star... but that's just my frugal opinion! ^^;)"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of the best katsu place in the city. You only have three choices: burger katsu, rice katsu, and noodle katsu. I tried the latter two and they were awesome. The chicken is crispy, moist and perfectly seasoned - you don't even need to use the sauce they provide if you don't want to. Their taro crisps are also delicious. They really had an extra layer to your meal.   I'm also fond of this place because it's really a hole in the wall. You almost feel special when you experience something that great in a place most people wouldn't look twice. The staff is also very friendly and they accommodated my kids' requests. If you want to try katsu or love it, this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"Five stars for a seriously mighty Chicken Katsu Burger ($9.99) and great service. I came here with a friend for a quick dinner. It was a bit quiet on a Saturday night, with only one other couple. This was nice as the place is small with one long bar table with high stools for dining in. The cashier was friendly and, overhearing us discussing which burger flavour to choose, assured us that as first-timers we should get the original. We also ordered the Bulgogi Noodle ($10.99).  When the server called us for the burger, I was shocked that it came with *two* large cutlets! The cutlets were perfectly deep fried on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. Mm. Mighty. The noodles were accurately described by the server as something in between udon and ramen. Great texture and chewiness. Bulgogi was not bad but not special, and same with the soup flavour, which was a rather light broth.  I've been wanting to start reviewing in Yelp for a while, and this big bite is what finally pushed me to the other side. Definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"It was delicious !!  I just finished eating my chucken Katsu burger ($10.16) and I must tell everyone about it. It comes with a small side of coleslaw and maybe a small piece of chicken on side (I don't know. I got one). The chicken Katsu is the Katsu dream. It's crispy and crunchy on the outside (but not crazy hard where it scrapes the roof of your mouth) and the most tendor juicy chicken on the inside. It's not greasy or oily at all and doesn't make you feel bloated or gross afterwards.  The burger was absolutely massive and the chicken was double the length of the bun. There is lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a very generous helping of coleslaw with some sort of mayo sauce. None of that ever compromised the crisp or the flavor of the Katsu.  I am so full and satisfied right now but still thinking about when the next time I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, but when I took a bite of their chicken katsu I was blown away.  This is the best place to get chicken katsu with cheese filling in he middle!!!  They were also playing \"red flavour\" by Red velvet and I am a huge fan of them.  I would definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"Reasonable price. Big portions. Good Katsu. Great sauces. Not the best taro chips. I can make do without the ube soft serve.  I quite like the food at fat ninja bite. Even take out, the Katsu remains fresh and crispy. It's not too heavy and the portion is huge! I like the burger more than the rice but that's just a personal preference. Their rice is cooked well too.   I think the highlight are their sauces which is needed to complete the dish. I usually go for their garlic, safe and full of garlic flavour but not too overpowering.   Their taro chips were inconsistent. Some were perfectly fried while others were rubbery or too hard. Quite expensive for what it's worth.   The Ube ice cream was also a miss. Ice cream texture was good but not smooth enough nor was it creamy. A bit more on the icy side. Not much ube flavour either. Will not get again.  Bulgogi is their alternative and that's good too, but only with sauce. I find that the bulgogi lacked flavour if no sauce is added. Can always get sauce on the side.   Overall great food! Taro chips and ube soft serve can be omitted but the rest of the food is definitely worth the try and to come back for."}
{"text":"Yummy tonkatsu and great price for HUGE portions. The service is super nice and they even give out fat ninja bite stickers! Limited seating and limited parking is the only downside. I would recommend the tonkatsu with rice or the tonkatsu burger over the udon (this was kinda bland)."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is spectacular. I've been here many times and the food and service never disappoint! The dumplings with Korean sauce are a MUST try, and of course any dish featuring their Katsu. Their noodle soup is so simple yet flavourful, and the chicken is cooked perfectly every single time. The workers are all so pleasant and they seem to remember all of their regulars. This is definitely somewhere that will be a staple in my food outings!"}
{"text":"Parking - very limited space if you come here on the weekend. You're better off parking somewhere further (like pmall or the plaza to the south) and walk over.   About this place  - small. Limited seatings. Turnover is somewhat quick, so you might be able to snag a  spot along the window. Otherwise, take it out and enjoy elsewhere.  Staff on hand is very friendly. Super friendly. They want you to enjoy your time here. It was super busy and all seats were filled.I was eating my burger standing by window. Eventually people left and seats opened up. I was personally brought a stool to sit on! If that's not friendly service, I don't know what is.   Food - the don katsu burger is huge and will definitely fill you up. It's too big to pick up and eat without it being messy. Batter wasn't thick at all. Tastes great overall."}
{"text":"After seeing so many pictures of the don katsu burger I finally got a chance to try it! The pictures definitely made me underestimate how BIG the burger actually is. The pork katsu itself is as big as my face. You have to cut off the sides and eat it alone before u can take a bite of the bun and the filling. That first bite with the sauce, the pork cutlet and the filling is amazing! Everything about the burger worked so well together! I would definitely come back. The only downfall is the parking lot. It is super tight and crowded all the time. I recommend parking at pacific mall and it's about a 5 min walk!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that this place replaced Big Moe's. There were a tonne of reviews for this place so I wanted to check it out. Ordered the pork katsu burger. Huge quantities. If you're looking for a different kind of burger, this is what you are looking for. The sauce in the katsu really adds a twist. When I come back, I'd like to try the Taro chips and soft serve. Parking wise there's not too many spots and the place itself is a bit small, but it's a great place for takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious Katsu burgers! I've tried the original don katsu and the cheese one. Enjoyed both of them! The portion size is huge for lunch might be better to share. The cheese one is stuffed with cheese inside- only down fall is that when you take a couple bites the cheese gushes out and is very messy to eat.   This place is beside the petro gas station, limited parking and more of a take out joint as there is only a few seats in the store. Recommend coming with a friend during busy times as you might not find parking."}
{"text":"Place is more of a take-away, quick eats type of place. This place serves donkatsu and bulgogi in a burger or stir fry. Their menu is limited, but incredibly tasty. I got the chicken katsu burger and my SO got chicken katsu stir fry. Both were flavourful and filling :) if you're ever around Pacific Mall, just cross the street and give them a try. They also serve ice cream here, but unfortunately didn't have time to try it. The Frontline staff and cooks are all very friendly as well :) will come back !"}
{"text":"Nowhere else will you find a magical place such as this that gives you essentially two helpings of Katsu for the price of one. It really is a beautiful thing. These katsu patties are the size of your face and then they will still give you extra! :D the owners/chefs are so friendly and despite only popping in once a month at most they seem to recognize me as a return customer which I really appreciate in a business. The seating AND parking is extremely limited so I suggest you plan for pick-up/takeout, or try and catch them at off peak times.   I suggest you try all the katsu options but the white meat chicken is the best!  And if you're a Taro fan pick up a small bag of their Taro chips, they are deliciously addictive.   I've also tried their bulgogi burger which was amazing and definitely worth trying but I just love my deep fried Katsu  :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Don katso (pork) burger. It's like an extreme tasty wiener schnitzel? on the best version of it. Any central European knows what it is."}
{"text":"+ Good food, reasonable price. Katsu burger was filling but light, similar to a tempura battering. Large portion for the don and chicken Katsu, with some on the side as well as in the burger. Taro chips were good too, fairly large for $3.  - Wait time, seating, and parking are things to consider. Go early and you can avoid those negatives."}
{"text":"What a great new place in the neighbourhood.  I came right after their grand opening on a weekday night.  It was not busy, so got a chance to chat with the owner.   They're in the midst of trying to expand their menu, and looking at their twitter account, all their ideas sound very yummy!! Can't wait until they put some of them on the menu.   We got one chicken katsu burger, one pork katsu burger to go.  And she was kind enough to give us a small sample of their fresh made taro chips! It had a nice blend of nori and salt. I've actually had a version where it was a little sweet, and I prefer it sweet rather than salty. But it was still very good!   The katsu burgers were huge! Might be pricey for a burger, but for what they give you, it's well worth it.  The crunchy breadcrumb outside is definitely different than other places!! So crispy and not oily.   The chicken katsu was better, because it was more moist inside, and the garlic sauce accompanied it very well.   Brought it home to eat since there isn't much space to eat in, but it was still crispy after we got home.    Can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying katsu. It was OK. You can't really comment on it because I don't have another katsu taste that I've had for comparison. Tried both the chicken and pork. They have both brown meat and white meat of chicken with different pricing. The annoying thing is the parking lot is tiny and gets full easily. Sometimes you have to park in the Pacific mall and walk over. The place is also not the cleanest as people come and go and we had to clean up before we sat in our spot. Seating is also tight and not a lot of space. Workers are really friendly."}
{"text":"Crunchy pork cutlet burger, the combination of the sauce and the meat are perfect!  As you can see the meat is huge! But with the sauce, you can eat it all!  I ordered both the pork cutlet w/cheese and the chicken cutlet burger. I enjoyed both. Chicken is tender and juicy; pork is crunchy and savoury  will be going back again!!"}
{"text":"Summary: giant katsu burgers and seafood pancake bring both quality and quantity to the table, but be ready for a lengthier wait time (it's worth it though!)  Top Must-Get: Chicken Katsu Burger Top Regret: Coleslaw  Parking is tight in this little plaza, so you might have to park at the one over (or at Pacific Mall), and if you come on a weekend night to this snug restaurant just south of the gas station, there will probably be a line up and all five counter seats will likely be occupied -   But there's a good reason.  Hello, meet a burger place where I don't NEED to order two different things to satisfy my hunger. That's pretty much the biggest general compliment I can give about portion size.  Katsu is fried fresh to order, which means more waiting - about 20 minutes at least for your order to be ready. But as other reviews have alluded to, the katsu has a solid crunch and a \"fresh\" fried taste.  Note it can be disappointing if you come late as they were out of both seafood noodles and taro chips when we asked for them.  All the burgers come with coleslaw. I didn't love their coleslaw, but then, I don't love any coleslaw. There wasn't a ton of it, and to be fair, it tasted fresh. Still, who comes to a fried burger joint for a healthy burger?  Granted, the burgers are healthy in the sense that it's not seeping oil out... But still very tasty.  Definitely going to be back! There are a few more things to try (although if they consistently are out of stock, that'll be kind of disappointing)."}
{"text":"Small space but the food is delicious! I ordered the Don Katsu with rice that came with coleslaw and spicy dumplings. The dumplings were so-so in terms of spice but the dumplings were good. The Don Katsu tasted amazing, breaded well but personally mine was a little over fried. The sauce that comes with it is delicious but I would've liked some more on the donkatsu. Nice to have this restaurant close to where I live and will be back to try out the potato croquettes and the cheese Don Katsu burger."}
{"text":"I ordered the dark meat chicken katsu burger and it was AMAZING. The portion was generous while the price is good. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My new favourite. Sooooo worth the horrible parking lot.   The chicken katsu burger was huge and fed us both. It was breaded with panko that was so light it must have been made with clouds. Also try the taro chips."}
{"text":"This was a good recommendation by a number of people, and I'm so happy I finally got to come!   There are maybe 6 stools to sit on, so this is mostly a takeout place. There's not much parking either.  I had heard these burgers were big, but I didn't think they'd be quite this big. My friend and I had noodle soups at Keung Kee for breakfast, so we shared a donkatsu (pork cutlet) burger ($8.99). I was ridiculously full after. The meat to bread ratio here is ridiculous in quite a good way, but it also makes this a little difficult to eat burger-style, unless you just want big bites of pork cutlet before you reach your bread. My hands aren't that big. Holding this was a challenge. Biting it was as well, but it was oh so worth it. The pork is juicy, and the sauces work well with the pork and the shredded cabbage on the bun. There are also slices of tomatoes and a few of pickles. Even if I wasn't full, I think half of one of these would be enough to satisfy me.   Their taro chips are delicious. At $2.99, it's a decent portion. The seaweed flavor is nice, but I really wanted to taste that taro, so if I could, I'd opt out of the seaweed bit.  The matcha and ube twist in a cup, at $3.50, is not bad. The rice krispies on the bottom are delightful. After mixing the matcha ice cream with this, I'm tempted to eat my cereal with matcha lattes from now on (Why isn't this a thing?) The chocolate and matcha pocky sticks were cute, but not necessary. I was excited to have ube soft serve, but it was slightly disappointing. It was tasty, but more purple vanilla flavored than strongly ube flavored. I will continue the hunt for Barney-purple, strongly flavored ube soft serve. Their matcha was good on matcha flavor though, so I would just opt for that one next time.  Service was great. Another group of customers dropped their ice cream (ouch). Fat Ninja Bite offered to make them a new one for free and they did it with a smile!  Side story: My friend got the chicken katsu burger ($8.99). I watched the person making it put another piece of meat next to the burger (for a total of two pieces of katsu). I thought she got our order wrong. I had ordered two donkatsu's and one chicken katsu, and I thought she thought I wanted a donkatsu burger and a second piece of donkatsu. Thankfully, she got it right. My friend got her chicken katsu with her side of chicken katsu. It was quite amusing. Also very impressive."}
{"text":"Can I just say... WOW!!! Like everyone else it breaks my heart to have to take one star away for the parking, seating, and longer than fast food usual (but totally worth while) wait for the food. Everything we ordered and the service were both top notch though!  The bulgogi burger was hands down everyone's favourite. I should have listened to other reviewers and got extra pickles! We also tried the seafood pancake (perfect balance of crispy and soft) , the don katsu burger (amazing mayo/sauce), and the bulgogi noodles (delicious filler). Cherry on the parfait is they also sell Japanese drinks.   The combination of flavours in every item was absolute perfection. The portions were in line with the price and the crowds following us in clearly knew this place is worth going out of the way for.   This was one of those meals we'll be talking about long after we digest it. No doubt we will be back for more. Looking forward to trying the ice cream next.   We were wise to leave the kids at home for this one seeing as there's only 10 stools in the whole place. One of the servers even brought out an extra stool for us. So sweet. Hopefully once this place gets fully established, they'll open up a better and larger location!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch with my friend and we were starving. Ordered a chicken katsu burger, katsu udon and seafood pancake. Portions are huge, so it was really too much food, but so delicious. The katsu (chicken and pork) were moist and soft, yet still crunchy. At other places I usually find a bit dry, so it's not generally one of my go tos.  Coleslaw is good, also crunchy. Pancake had lots of seafood and veg in it.  You can eat it with or without the sauce and it was fine. We also bought a bag of the taro chips, which had little bits of shredded seaweed in it. Not too salty which is how I like it.  For dessert, we ordered the ube/green tea parfait. The toasted marshmallows were perfect. Only thing I would change about that is to sprinkle half the rice crispies over the ice cream, as you had to dig into it a bit to get at it.  Obviously I would come here again and try other things on their menu"}
{"text":"This is a tiny, hidden gem in this plaza behind a gas station. I loved the natural lighting. Although the view was just the parking lot, the restaurant was well-lit and the view was lo-fi quality. It was an urban beauty.   I had a katsu udon ($10.50) and my dude had a katsu burger ($9.50).   The udon was fine, nothing too special. The katsu's batter fell off the meat so that was a little ick, and the batter was too thick for my liking. I guess that's probably because I'm comparing between this and Onnki. However, I do like that you can see the kitchen area make your food right in front of you. The udon soup was nothing that really stood out to me.   Katsu burger was HUGE. You could probably make 2 burgers from that. From what I heard, the sauce was great and everything was fresh. I'd def recommend this if you are hungry.   Customer service was great. They said hello to us when we walked in and were very nice. I'd def recommend this place if you're looking for a bite. Get the burger if you're starving.   We also had taro chips. They were great and not too salty! It's $3/bag but they pack that bag pretty tight. They also had taro chip samples by the cash if you're curious before buying."}
{"text":"I had the Katsu burger when I was here, which came with coleslaw on the side. The price came to around $11 after tax, which is actually a really good deal! The quality and portion vs. price for the burger is hard to beat, and probably one of my favorite places for Katsu now.   TL;DR: My new spot for Katsu, and the portion + quality to price is amazing. Try the Katsu burger and you won't regret it!  1. Food (5/5)  For any fried foods, there are a certain set of standards that I have in placed. I look at the quality of the batter, the thickness of the batter, the amount of time spent in the oil, and a few other things. I think the Katsu patty that I got with my Katsu burger at Fat Ninja Bite meets all my expectations, and more (especially in terms of portion). This might be a bit biased since I had this at like 10 pm when I was really hungry, but I definitely urge you to try the burger and let me know if I am wrong. From me personally, no complaints.  I haven't tried the Ube soft served, but I have heard from friends that it is something that you should try too!  2. Service (4.5/5)  The chef and cashier are friendly and nice. Once, they heard that we were hungry and gave us some extra coleslaw to go along with the meal. Although their food takes a bit longer than average to finish cooking, it certainly is fresh; a trade-off that I can live with.  3. Space (3.5/5)  A bit small in terms of sitting space. There's roughly 9 - 10 seats that are facing the window. It's a pretty cozy place, but if you're going for dinner during prime time, I wouldn't expect a seat.   ------------  Overall (4.25 - 4.5/5)"}
{"text":"Good place for cheap Japanese style pork chop. Portion and price make it very good at value. Must check it out if you are around Pacific mall."}
{"text":"On my week off with the bae, we decided to hit up as many food joints (both new and old) On account that I mentioned this to him several dozen times, he finally brought me back! Every time I come here I order the katsu burger which leaves me feeling SO full, and SO bloated but it is worth to me! The katsu is just as big as the first time (about the size of an old VCR tape) and for $10 you too can leave happy, and full of gloat before the itis kicks in. I cut around the bun this time, and tried to eat as much of the katsu with the knife and fork before going hands deep into the burger. After chowing down I felt like the kid who has ice cream all over their face.   Will be back again in 6 months or so and maybe then I'll learn my lesson of messing eating and order the katsu don instead. Writing this review has made me crave it again. Next time I'll give their übe ice cream a try.  The parking lot hasn't expanded so the rule still applies - park at the Petro Canada and walk up the small hill separating this plaza and the gas station."}
{"text":"Were in the area waiting to meet up with friends for dinner so decided to drop by to get some ice cream  The place is small but feel very cosy and welcoming. For the ice cream, there are two flavours: purple sweet potato and green tea. I only picked single flavour $3.50 because I wanted to taste the purple sweet potato by itself but you have an option to get the twist swirl  It was my first time eating ice cream with rice Krispies and I really like it!! They were super crunchy and added a toasted flavour to the ice cream. However I couldn't really taste the purple sweet potato and it was more to the milky side. It was still good ice cream, just not what I expected  Don't forget to grab a bag of house-made taro chips. When I got there a new batch was being made and they were still warm. I really enjoyed these chips!  Would love to go back and try their Chicken Katsu burger and grab some more taro chips!"}
{"text":"I love Kastu, it's such a basic concept. You get a thin slice of meat and then you coat it in egg wash then coat it in breadcrumbs before you fry it. I love doing it at home so part of me wondered how good can Fat Ninja Bite's Katsu be? Well it's amazing! Their Katsu is just the flakiest yet light and crispy. It's crazy delicious.  We went and tried their sandwich with the chicken Katsu in dark meat and the pork Don Katsu with rice. I'll tell you now that the sandwich was a clear 5/5 while the rice was 4/5. The sandwich has so many components to it and together was more hormonious.  I also preferred the chicken over the pork. Even though the pork was indeed tender, the chicken was juicier and a lighter chew worked better.   The sandwich had tomatoes, lettuce, slaw, and even pickles, brought together by a nice spicy mayo. As you've seen the cutlet itself, is way bigger than the bun itself, we ate the second cutlet on it's own. What I really liked was their sauce. It's sweet and slightly tangy. It resembles something of a teriyaki sauce and it's excellent.   The rice plate was more ordinary and just featured the Katsu with rice and slaw. Again, you get two cutlets, and there's a ton of food here. The slaw is pretty ordinary, it would be interesting if FNB offered a more traditional thinly sliced and lightly dressed cabbage slaw instead a mayo based one."}
{"text":"Huge massive enormous portions! Also fantastic non greasy crispy fried goodness.  I got the burger and loved it. Katsu Don (pork) pretty straightforward menu not a lot of sides or options to be fussed with but the star is definitely the protein choice. If you want more traditional a with rice option is available. Limited but ok seating is available and the service was super friendly and accurate."}
{"text":"Today was my second time to Fat Ninja Bite. My first visit was on their opening week and I have great memories of that day. This is a small Korean joint catered towards takeout although there is bar style seating available for up to 12. The cashier is extremely friendly and eager to answer any questions you might have. The last time I was here we ordered the Don Katsu (Pork Burger) and Chicken Katsu Noodle. The noodles were good but the star here is really the Katsu.  Today I ordered the Chicken Katsu (Dark) Burger. I was so surprised when I turned around and saw the plate. A giant piece of thinly pounded chicken covered in fresh Korean breadcrumbs and fried to perfection. The Katsu was covered with a brown sauce and is a little under seasoned, my only knock on this. The burger is topped with thinly shaved cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayo. The burger was awesome and was accompanied with a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was thick cut, very creamy and also very good.  A unique item they serve here is Taro chips with a Nori (seaweed) seasoning. While I did not have them this time, I did them during my first visit and recall them to be quite tasty. Very light and delicate, a bit salty, just how chips should be.  If you're in the neighbour and craving some Katsu be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Don Katsu Burger ($9.99). It was huge in size with a big piece of that deep fried pork chop in the middle, the burger bun only covers half of the pork chop area. It's quite difficult to hold it with your hand without making a mess out of it.  Tips: Ask for extra Don Katsu sauce on the side and use a knife and fork to cut off the excess meat that sticks out of the bun and enjoy it with the dipping sauce.  I also ordered a green tea ice cream ($3.50) to finish off the meal. The green tea (matcha) flavor is not as strong as some other places that specialize in green tea dessert/ice cream. However, it really goes well with a couple of toro chips. (I took a couple of pieces from the sample tray, thanks to the cashier lady!) The saltiness of the chips really compliments the sweetness of that soft melting ice cream.  I will definitely come back when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Got takeout in the middle of the afternoon. I ate it after I got home (which was around 20 minutes after receiving it  Got myself a good katsu burger, taro fries, ninja croquettes, and kimchi slaw (all for my lonesome self). Katsu in the burger was nice soft and crispy. The burger itself reminded me of a McDonald's burger. Very soft. Had tomatoes and regular slaw which was a good balance. Only issue with it was the katsu was much much bigger than burger itself. It was hard to handle. Ninja croquettes were soft and well battered. Seems they know how to deep fry a thing or two."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a burger fan nor deep fried food, but their don katsu burger was awesome, I would highly recommend it for anyone that's never tried it before  The downside is the location. It's pretty packed every time I've been there, and parking isn't super convenient, especially getting out of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Ordered the Don Katsu burger &. Chicken Katsu rice.  The Katsu is SO tender inside.  The fried outer layer is very crispy, light and immensely satisfying.  The sauce in the burger is delicious, I think it'll be something I'll be craving soon enough.  Would have like it more if the burger bun was toasted, but it was still delicious none the less.  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, super friendly people.  Had the chicken Katsu burger, Korean pancake and chicken katsu with stir fry noodles.  Parking is tricky that's the only downside but that's not their fault.   I'll let the pictures speak for themselves."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, it gets better every time I visit. I always come for the white meat katsu burger and the fresh taro chips, I just ate one right now and I'm just lost for words, so delicious, so perfectly cooked. The customer service is also  5* , such nice people! This place is a must at least once a month for my boyfriend and I ."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the restaurant is clean.  Limited seating and parking is tight.  Food was tasty and made to order."}
{"text":"Holy cow the cheese don katsu burger is sooo good.   Friendly service too!  definitely will be back to try rest of the menu.   Update, came back for chicken katsu.  Would give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad I found this place!  The food is delicious and the service is friendly.  Food is made fresh as you order.  Tried many things in our first visit and had leftovers!  Portions are huge.  The don katsu burger is great.  Seafood Korean pancake is yummy!  The dumplings are made from frozen but the toppings.  Grab some taro chips to go!"}
{"text":"Seriously, soooo good. Delicious food freshly made to order, cheap, big portions, private parking lot, friendly service, I am sold. My fiance and I ordered a don katsu burger and chicken katsu on rice. The burger was exactly what I had seen on instagram: HUGE. It was too big to eat. Both katsus were tender and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I didn't really have to chew on my chicken katsu (that tender). Apparently they make their own bread crumbs with bread made from a local bakery (according to their ig post). Rice was moist and hot and coleslaw was creamy but not too sour. They could use a firmer buns to better hold all the components of the burger. Other then that, I couldn't find any cons."}
{"text":"This place gets an A+ for everything besides location. The location sucks, but more on that in a minute. The food was delicious and inspired and prepared fresh when you ordered. The portions were huge and the katsu was light and crispy and not heavy or greasy. We also tried the donburi and it was solid as well (although I think the chicken katsy still wins).  The location however, is in this tiny plaze near Pacific Mall, with almost no parking. We were lucky to get a parking spot next to a dumpster out back. The restaurant itself is small, but clean. I feel like they have already outgrown this space and need a new one."}
{"text":"Had the before katsu burgers before and they were sooo filling and delicious, def worth it for the price (bc tbh half a burger is already enough for me!!). The pieces of meat inside are twice the size of the bun. It's super worth it esp when you consider that most mcdonald burgers are around $10 now!   Today I got the takoyaki and it was the best i've had in a longgg time. They are one of the rare places that actually make it on hand (i think they actually have batter and those traditional molds?), and not just heat it up when you order. The outside was crunchy while the inside was soft. The sauces and toppings were traditional, and the filling was traditional as well with the octopus. They come with a spicy mayo sauce and i recommend getting it on the side. It was $5.99 for 6 pieces and that's about the regular price for takoyaki i'd say. Typing this makes me want to get more tomorrow"}
{"text":"Sooooo good. I had the Bulgogi burger, and it was fantastic. The meat was moist, and saucy, and the pickles, lettuce, and American style bun complemented the Korean flavours perfectly. I was surprised to see that that they didn't have Kimchi poutine, but the taro chips almost made up for it.  Parking is non egsistent, but there are plenty of places near by. What's a little walk for God's food?"}
{"text":"I like everything on their menu, everything they fried is really well made, the meat to batter ratio is right on. I highly recommend the taro chips as they make a pretty good snack. The burgers are as good as they look in the pictures. Overall, great food in a cozy place."}
{"text":"Went to this place solely because of reviews, and it definitely lived up to the hype! Got the chicken katsu burger and stir fry noodles with chicken katsu (both white meat), and they were amazing! Chicken is super thin and crispy and the portion of chicken is so massive it comes out the burger! Got the same chicken for the stir fried noodles and very thankful that they pack the chicken in a separate container for take out so it doesn't get soggy!  Overall, very great experience! Friendly staff, about 10 spaces for seating, and excellent taro chips that are a must try!  PS- If you can dine-in, I'd recommend it! The chicken is at its 100% best when it's straight off the fryer and super crispy!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype in my opinion  I ordered the chicken katsu burger ($8.99). They told me there would be a 10 minute wait for it, which was fine as I didn't mind waiting.   The burger is HUGE! The katsu part of the burger is 2 times as big as the actual burger itself! Taste wise, I didn't think it was anything special. Nothing wowed me on my first bite. Sure the burger tasted good but it was nothing spectacular and I don't think I would be going back again for one.   The parking lot here is tiny! I got there shortly after it opened so there were still spots but if you were to come during rush hours I do suggest you park elsewhere and walk over. I don't think the lanes can even fit 2 cars going in opposite directions. Turning out of the plaza may be difficult as well."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. We ordered ahead and when we came our order was ready on the counter. It's a small cozy place and very casual atmosphere, could get very busy during rush hours though.  While I would love to rave about how flavourful and crispy their Chicken Katsus are, I would like to draw your attention towards the unsung hero of this place: Takoyaki, or what i call, The Octopus Balls! They were Delicious!!! I haven't had it in many places but the best one I had was in Kinka Izakaya and these were equally flavourful, warm and fluffy from inside."}
{"text":"Was pretty good.  Thought the chicken tonkatsu was better than the pork tonkatsu (juicier).    Even tough it was pretty expensive for lunch (around $35), we left pretty full"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but its the service that really wowed me! All the staff members were courteous and friendly making the experience truly great. The prepacked taro chips were one of the best one I've tried. They were sprinked with seaweed bits and they tasted fresh. I got a dark meat katsu burger. Not only was the meal instagram worthy, it was also incredibly filling.   I will be coming back but maybe at a less busy hour (we came Friday around 6:30pm) due to the parking lot situation previously mentioned by other Yelpers. Parking can be a bit crazy."}
{"text":"Full stars for a very tasty meal, lovely customer service and a good price. Foodies will appreciate their taro chips and unique burgers. I enjoyed a delicious pork katsu with rice and slaw. Good to the last bight."}
{"text":"Went to this spot recently with my girlfriend and we were not disappointed. Located on Kennedy Rd. Just south of Steele's, this spot can be easy to miss but make sure that you don't.  I got the cheese katsu sandwich and it was very well executed and presented. The cheese was piping hot and the dish wasn't too messy overall (I was expecting it would be). We also got a bag of taro chips and they were really good too.   The menu is simple and that's honestly great because it allows for there to be a few great options versus a whole bunch of ok options. I'll definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food 5/5 The employees 5/5  Atmosphere 4/5  When I say their burgers are big, I do mean it's big. You have to try at least one of each. I haven't had the chance to try their other dishes, but I'm definately willing to.   I think their prices are fair for the amount of food you get. It's delicious too, so why wouldn't you pay a little more for quality food?  Keep in mind, if you get the burgers, its the best when its fresh. Forget about keeping clean, your hands and face are going to be covered in their sauce. And I don't think you'll mind when all you want is another bite!  The only problem I do have, is the parking. That plaza doesn't have enough space for their customers. So, if you ever want to go, either get take out or just walk. If you walk, it's just another incentive to get another burger!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, their \"burgers\" are actually chicken sandwiches. 3.5 stars for the food but the warm and attentive customer service bumps it up to 4 stars.  Sunny, the owner, is truly a ray of sunshine. She greets all her customers with a smile and cheerful \"hello\", checks on them during their meal and thanks them as they leave.   I ordered the cheese Don Katsu Burger with a side of Taro chips. They had just finished deep frying a batch of them so she offered me a few to munch on while I was waiting on my order. I sat on one of the stools and noticed Kpop playing in the background which added positive energy and liveliness to the place. They have a strong heater above the seating area so I was nice and toasty even though it was chilly outside.   The sandwich is massive and the katsu sticks out of both ends. The panko breading is processed finer than the usual so the katsu was only crunchy around the edges. The cheese in the middle is mozzarella so it didn't add flavor to the sandwich. The sauce was sweet so I asked for their spicy mayo which has sriracha in it to balance the flavor. It made for a decent and filling sandwich. The taro chips which were perfectly seasoned with pink Himalayan salt and tiny bits of nori were DELISH!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time about two weeks ago, based on the amazing yelp reviews. The reviews were not wrong at all. I was skeptical at first as the restaurant looks small and unimpressive from the outside. It's located right across from Pacific Mall, and has a small parking lot at the back. The feel is more a fast food joint than a real sit down place, there's seating for about 10-12 people. There's isn't a lot of space to wait or sit and eat. But gosh the food is amazing! I ordered the white meat chicken Katsu burger, and my husband ordered the cheese don katsu burger. The burgers were fresh and hot. The meat patties were thick, juicy and crunchy, and the coleslaw was tangy and delicious. The flavors all complemented each other nicely. We also had some delicious and crispy taro chips that were seasoned with salt and some seaweed. I'd definitely return and recommend this eatery!"}
{"text":"If you are used to the long Kennedy bus ride to Pmall, you likely have become familiar with the sight of the gas station fronting you when you get off at Steeles. Next door to that gas/bus stop, there's a tiny nondescript plaza. There it hides, waiting to sneak up on the unsuspecting hungry.  It's Fat Ninja Bite, a great nearby alternative to Pacific Mall food. It is dearly small inside, with only eat-in space for eight people facing the window. The sudden popularity means it's quite the crowd in here at times.  Like so many suckers I had to try the Don (pork) Katsu Burger. It is massive, and the slab of katsu comically sticks out of the bun in every direction--you struggle to figure out how to eat this big ass monster. The burger is full of crunch and whips your stomach full easily. I just wish there was more savoury flavours packed in it."}
{"text":"The pork katsu was huge - it couldn't even fit in the takeout box before they cut it. The flavors were immense and the umami was delightful."}
{"text":"The chicken katsu rice here is delicious!! Honestly the best chicken cutlet I've ever had. It's best eaten fresh, so enjoy it ASAP! This place is pretty small with limited seating so I usually end up having to eat inside pacific mall or at a local park if the weather is nice enough. If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First off, let me start off by putting it out there that I'm NOT a Katsu fan... it's OK - but I always feel like Katsu is nothing really special and there are always better things to have on the menu so take my review with a grain of salt.   We each ordered Chicken Katsu on rice and 1 Chicken Katsu Noodle.  The Katsu was decently portioned and were quite large for $9.  They were crispy and sweet but I didn't find them anything special that made them stand out. The noodle soup was meh... the noodles were chewy and cooked well but the broth was a little underwhelming.   They sold taro chips which probably were made in-store but they were packaged by the counter and not freshly made to order which, really, I could probably buy at a store.   The menu offers wedding noodle which they've apparently stopped selling \"a while back\" but hasn't been taken off the menu and the sign inside AND outside makes mention of waffles and chicken - please note that the waffles piece was supposedly from the previous business (even though their counter menu also says they carried waffles), big Moe's and this place sadly does not offer it, regardless of the ads.   So truly, this place offers Katsu (pork or chicken) on a bun, with rice, with a thick noodle clear broth soup, Korean pancake, taro chips, or soft serve ice cream.  There were 4 of us and only 1 of us was extremely impressed with the place (which happens to love every Katsu he's ever tried so again - grain of salt).  Sorry but we'd probably not go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendliest staff. Thank you for the hospitality. We got the katsu and bulgogi burgers with chips and they were amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the staff were attentive and gave us suggestions since we haven't been there before.  I decided on the chciken Katsu (dark meat) and it did not disappoint.  Like other reviews, the wow factor is in the size of the sandwich.  Surprisingly the sandwich tasted very light and I didn't feel like shit after.  The chicken itself was very tender but nicely fried to a golden brown.  The sandwich consists of a slaw and pickles.  It also has a little extra slaw on the side.  Overall it was a good lunch and I may bump this to a 5 star after I try a few other items on the menu on my next visit."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm definitely a fan of fat ninja bite. The Chicken Katsu Burger and Takoyaki were really good!   The Katsu burger with dark meat was super tender and crispy. The batter they use for crust is delicious. I couldn't believe how light it was! I want to deep fry everything in that batter. Everything.  Their Takoyaki...mmmm. That spicy sauce really gave it a nice kick and it wasn't overpowering. I think it is sriracha mayo but it was a bit waterier so it may have been mixed with lemon juice or something. The girl gave it to us on the side so we were able to put as much or as little of it as we wanted on each bite. The octopus inside was super soft and tender. Definitely coming back for this one. I ate most of the plate before I remembered to take a picture!  Everyone at this restaurant is super happy and nice and greet you in a really friendly manner when you enter/exit the restaurant. Can't come back to try their other stuff too!"}
{"text":"This places is awesome really friendly staff and really tasty burgers the crust is soo crispy and perfectly done and that taste of coconut just take its to next level."}
{"text":"Just went for the matcha ice cream and it was really good compared to other soft serve matcha ice cream places.  The prices they charge for the matcha ice cream is very affordable and portions are very large as well. I stop by after eating some Japanese food next door and I was glad I stopped by.  Too bad I was full because the food they serve at the store looked really good I'll definitely come back next time and try their katsu Burger among other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"First post of 2018.. Oops I'm a little delayed.  This place is super teeny tiny but it had such a welcoming atmosphere. The staff there are super friendly and all Japanese. There's about maybe 10 seats  but not a lot of people usually stay to eat. It's great for take out but since there were spots today, I've decided to take a seat.   We ordered the Don Katsu with rice $9.50 and the chicken Katsu on burger $9.50. IT WAS HUGE!!!!!! MASSIVE!!!!!!  You could fully fold the Katsu into your burger and it would still have extras. I couldn't believe the size. Not only is it huge, it was delicious!!!! The breading was unlike any other.... And I have eaten a whole lot of Katsu in my lifetime. I've been trying to find a place to have amazing Katsu and I think I found it!!   I've also ordered their ube ice cream in a cup. OMG ube!!!!!   I can't wait to try something else!  I will probably try the bulgogi and the stir fry noodles next time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner today and was not disappointed. I tried their taro chips, chicken katsu burger, and takoyaki. The chips were so crunchy and the seaweed flavour was just right. The burger was super juicy and I was blown away by how big it was. The takoyaki was also really tasty.   Food aside, service was great. Only downside is that parking and seating are limited."}
{"text":"Used to be Big Moe's Burgers. Only a few parking spots and a few seats inside. Staffs are nice and friendly. Super sized Chicken and Pork cutlet, comes with their tasty coleslaw. Will re-visit for sure."}
{"text":"Loved donkatsu burger. Very generous portion. Staff were very kind, cheerful and helpful. Will come back for more."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja is a must visit if you're in Scarborough, Markham area and craving for katsu. I'm in love with their chicken katsu burger (dark meat) + bulgogi burger. Both are so wonderful crafted and full of flavour. The katsu has the perfect level of crunch to it. Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable! Love love this place !!"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent, but don't get your expectations up because of the good reviews. I found the katsu burger fine, nothing special ... except the giant size of the meat which made it very difficult to eat.  The meat was a bit tough as well.  The bulgogi was tasty, and prices were pretty good. I would come back to try the ice-cream ..."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after A) reading the reviews and B) loving the name of this place.  Parking at this place is very limited.  There is a sushi place and a hair/nail salon that share the 15 or so parking spaces. Managed to find a spot way in the back of the lot, and walked to the front of the lot for the restaurant.    Walked in was immediately greeted by a normal Japanese welcome !  Fat Ninja Bite is a very simple place.  There is a counter that runs pretty much the width of the place with a dozen or so stools opposite with views outside.  Yup, that's it.  Menu boards above the kitchen. Walked up to the counter and ordered.  Went with the katsu chicken over rice.  Had a seat along the windows and in no time my order was up,  retrieved my styrofoam container of food.  First bites and the katsu chicken, rice and slaw were all very good.  However the katsu isn't over the rice, the rice is a scoop in a separate section of the container.  Had to ask for soya sauce, but that was no big deal.  The portion size is rather large for the $10 meal.  Not quite Hawaiian plate lunch size, but close.   I wasn't able to finish all of the food, so I took it with me and walked out.    Overall, this is a small quaint place.  Food is good and the server/cooks were very friendly. I think ideally this is a take out place, but based on the parking situation, this might be a bit tough too.  I like the food and I'll go back again to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite is a dainty place that offers Katsu. It is located across from Pacific Mall; it's a bit hidden but it is the entrance that is right before the Shell Gas Station. There is limited seating for about 12 people but being able to eat it fresh is amazing. Turnover is somewhat quick but it does take some time- they make each order on the spot and for people eating- the portions are very generous.  Most people would get the burger option- you get a freshly fried giant piece of Katsu that is larger than the bun with sauces, toppings and a coleslaw (you can also get a dipping sauce). The meat wasn't dry and the batter wasn't thick. It tasted great overall and you become really full. Aside from having burgers, there are options to have rice or noodles instead. The rice plate features two cutlets and mayo based slaw with the rice.   Overall, it is a must try."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite gets 3.5/5 stars :) My friend and I came here for an early dinner. We saw lots of great reviews for this place so we gave it a try! Service was excellent - we asked what's popular on the menu and they suggested anything katsu-related. There are limited bar seats at this place, it is designed for grab-and-go. Since we came during dinner, seats were available. I assume it's busy during lunch time.  * DON KATSU BURGER (3.5/5) The rare moment when the meat is bigger than the bun..!! The pork cutlet in the middle was nice and thin. Yummy!  * KATSU UDON  My friend ordered this and said the katsu burger is a better pick if you're choosing between these two items on the menu."}
{"text":"I got the takoyaki and chicken katsu burger. Very filling! I'd suggest to ask for spicy mayo on the burger, or on the side for that extra flavor kick (free of charge). It was pretty good, they make the chicken katsu fresh in front of you so that's nice. My only critique is that burger could've had a bit more flavour, chicken was tasty but otherwise a bit plain. Very friendly service. I'd definately come here again."}
{"text":"Hospitality 100% 5 STAR  Food 100% deliciousness!! Location is small but so are most gems ;)  Owner Sunny and chef Patrick were so friendly!! Can't wait to come back and see them again!  Very simple clear menu with awesome pictures! Katsu is their game here and you can get it over rice or noodles, but I recommend burger style. It's massive!! And I love the breading and sauces. I personally got the Don katsu burger which is pork. I love all the veggies :) makes it both a heavy and refreshing dinner. My boyfriend got the rice with chicken katsu. You can choose white or dark meat which is nice :)  End the night with their ube soft serve. It's my first time having ube, so I'm not sure how this flavour tastes traditionally, but this ones quite delicious. Very creamy and light and the most beautiful purple haha! And the bottom is lined with rice Krispy cereal!! My favorite!!!! Why are we not all eating ice cream with this cereal???!!!! This needs to be a thing!!  They make fresh taro chips every morning as well. These are really yummy chips seasoned with seaweed seasoning. I really like these but OMG they are going to get addicting!!   Come by this place! Great, friendly staff here. Great value for food. There's only about 16 seats so you might want to consider take out. Lots of people seem to do that :) very popular choice!"}
{"text":"To be honest I wasn't prepared, I had a little snack before showing up here. Big mistake, the chicken Katsu burger was bigger than expected. Delicious and crispy. Almost didn't finish my meal and that rarely happens. GOOD JOBS GUYS"}
{"text":"Speed read: 1) Big Panko pork burger.  Very filling for one person. 2) Not too oily 3) Small place, 10 seating.  Mostly take out. 4) Taro Chips - Interesting  Fat Ninja!  You got that right, you will get fat! Why?  Good.... BIG THICK piece of panko crusted pork, deep fried....droooling! Taro chips with seaweed is very interesting.  If you never had it, i highly recommended it.  Bad.... Too much sauce, i found it overpowering.....and yes, if you do follow my posts, you will see me complaining about this for many places.  Small place, only around 10 seats.  The problem is that you need to eat this fresh made, so I don't like takeout, as it will be all soggy when I get home.  Dark and tight parking, be careful maneuvering at night.  Ugly..... I love to come back!! Getting fat is ugly....just joking."}
{"text":"A brand new hotspot for those who would love some authentic Korean / Japanese street food. Set up to be a pick up and go restaurant, the space has a very simple modern decor with an open set up. The service is efficient and very friendly. The owners are dedicated to their passion for food and are happy to answer any questions you have.   The food is delicious. While this is a take out restaurant, their food portions are generous and the quality is very impressive. They make all their dishes based on their own recipes - from the spicy Korean sauce to the bread crumbs that coat their katsu. I don't simply mean they make their own bread crumbs from  a bread....they have the recipes for the breads sent to a baker who provides them fresh breads twice a week. They then make the bread crumbs in house! You can purchase their original bread crumbs, their matcha bread crumbs, or their ube (sweet purple potato) bread crumbs.   My favourite dish is definitely their Katsu Burger. Their Katsu is well seasoned, the meat tender and so juicy! The portions are more than enough for one and the price is a bargain for sure. The taro chips are handmade, seasoned with pink sea salt and japanese toppings - in short, yummy and addictive. When you go to try their foods, I highly recommend ordering for you and a few friends - their portions are large enough to share and you would want to try their noodles (a cross between udon and ramen in terms of texture), their Korean Pancakes (delicious and filled with yummy ingredients), and even their soft serve ice cream!    Have you gone to try it yet? Let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"The best chicken katsu in Markham. This place has surpassed the First Markham Place food court's katsu by a MILE. We have new players in town, and they're here to stay.  I ordered the chicken katsu burger at 9PM, and it took 10-15 minutes for it to be made. The wait was well worth it as the quality of the katsu was SUPERB. I'm going back to try the chicken katsu noodles, so stay tuned   Customer service: A+++ Food quality: A++ Price to food quality/quality ratio: GET IN MY BELLY!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot tucked behind the Petrocanada. Food: Giant piece of chicken katsu (fried chicken) served on rice or a bun. There are some other items on the menu but this the reason why you need to go. Should check out the ice cream as well, it's made in house. Staff: Super friendly and helpful. First time I went with a group of 5 we weren't able to get seats and they pulled chairs out so we could sit at the service area and then offered said homemade ice cream to us as an apology that we didn't have seats, even though it wasn't their fault. Vibe: Tiny little place that can get rammed at peak outs. Most come for takeout but seats are still limited if you're coming with a group."}
{"text":"This cute little shop definitely deserves more attention from the public.  If you like Chicken Katsu, this is the place to go. They offer only 6 items that includes rice, burger, noodle soup with Katsu. (cheese katsu is also available) My boyfriend got a cheese cats burger and it was massive, and delicious. And mine wasn't bad either, I had the chicken katsu noodles- but I definitely should have gotten the burger.  Their Taro chips were also a plus. They were deep fried with seaweed seasoning for $3 a bag.   I also really like their good service. Everyone'd greet you when you enter their shop and they were very friendly.   I'd definitely recommend to people who likes burger and also wanted to try something new rather than the basic beef or chicken patty."}
{"text":"Good food - huge portions and reasonably priced. fast service as we got our sandwiches and stir fry immediately. people are nice.   major downside: parking and lack of seating. this place only has 8 stools to sit on"}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing burger! One bite in (first time trying this place out) and I knew I'd be back for more. I had the beef burger, it's was very juicy and it had some nice, sweet rich flavors in that burger. One of the best burgers I've had for sure. Also, the staff is very friendly!   Props to them     Bit of the down sides, not much just a little:  Place was a little hard to find (a bit hidden)  Not much parking   Coleslaw was okay  Side of potato chips were just okay as well (tasted a bit plain)"}
{"text":"Their katsu burger is absolutely amazing. Unlike anything ive had before. I got the chicken katsu. It was juicy but crispy at the same time, and not too greasy. The burger itself was huge! And the staff is super friendly! Too bad i dont live in canada othetwise id come here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Markham! Small place but busy, which can only mean one thing - good grub!! Tried the white chicken sandwich. It hit the spot and tasted delicious!! Will definitely be back for another lunch"}
{"text":"Me and a friend were looking for a cheap but filling place to eat. Needless to say, Fat Ninja Bite delivered. Amazing service; the owner was extremely welcoming, and friendly.  We both had the Katsu chicken burger ($8.99 each), which was well worth the price. The chicken portion was huge, and the ingredients were fresh. Came with a tasty side of coleslaw as well. We also received a complimentary side of Taro chips which were very well done; nice and crispy.   Definitely going to come back here."}
{"text":"Soooooo Good! Stumbled upon this when visiting Toronto from the states. A great find. Food was freshly prepared, tried chicken Katsu and fried noodles with beef. Kids had noodle soup, everyone enjoyed it. Service was fast and super friendly."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff, and delicious food!  Tried the chicken katsu burger and don katsu noodle with gyoza on the side. It lives up to the hype but the only thing to improve on in my opinion is the crunchiness factor!"}
{"text":"OMG sooooo good! I had the white meat chicken katsu and it wae so delicious - probably one of the best things I've tasted in awhile. It was massive, so I don't recommend what I did - eating it right after a 30km bike ride. My stomach was not happy but my taste buds were overjoyed, so I guess it balanced out.  They're basically fried chicken filets served on bread, with a shot sized side of coleslaw. The texture of the chicken was perfect, tender and crispy. I can't say anything bad about it. I highly recommend it. It's a small location with only a few seats so probably best for take out, but eat it quickly before it gets cold!"}
{"text":"Tried there Chicken and Don katsu both the burger and noodle. They were both amazing. The don katsu can be a bit dry. Very friendly staff, not much parking or seating."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and all the great reviews. Came for some take out on a Saturday night. Ordered a Cheese Donkatsu burger and a side of dumplings (they sold out of the taro chips! Make sure to go earlier if you want to try!)  Unfortunately there was a slight mishap and they packed the bag without the dumplings, which I didn't discover till I got home. I drove back and they made it on the spot and gave us a few extra, so that was nice.   The burger was huge! The taste was great and it was still nice and crunchy. The cheese could have been more melty inside though, I'm not sure if it got too cold after driving back and forth. The dumplings came topped in your choice of Korean style or Ninja (they gave us both cause they forgot) and are quite tasty.  Definitely have to come back to try the taro chips!"}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite has been on my hit list for a very long time! I've seen lots of photos posted of delicious looking (and huge) food, I've read the reviews, and I've seen friends checking in on Yelp and FB. I've even had friends tell me that I should go but never understood why they just didn't invite me. Hmmm, friends? I even came here once, only to discover that they didn't open on Tuesdays. They do now!  First of all, the very friendly and welcoming staff greeted me very enthusiastically as soon as I stepped in. I thought it was just me but they greeted everybody that way. They were very engaging during my entire visit.  JK, a regular visitor here, ordered for us. We had the Chicken Katsu (dark meat) burger and an order of Takoyaki (octopus). Later, we had some delicious Taro chips and purple Taro ice cream, something new for me. It was all quite yummy!  The chicken was so deliciously tender and the breading was extra crunchy, making for a wonderful contrast. I heard they make their own breadcrumbs from bread made specially for this purpose. Hey, whatever they're doing, I'm a believer!  The takoyaki, not something I would normally order, was good but could have been crisper. It had good flavour.  The taro chips were really nice but I guess I had a quota because JK took them home. At least she allowed me to eat most of the ice cream.  I'll definitely come back. And bring more friends."}
{"text":"I didn't know how I'd feel about a pork katsu burger at first, but I was immediately drawn to the idea of a pork cutlet filled with cheese and deep fried. It was delicious and literally reminded me of a Big Mac but with a pork cutlet. I also enjoyed the taro chip which were freshly made, and tossed in seaweed seasoning.   The burger itself was massive! I had to cut this in half to share, and we were both stuffed! I will definitely return to try some more of their katsu dishes!"}
{"text":"Having seen their impressive burgers floating around on my friend's feed, I finally had the chance to check this place out. Parking is sparse and there is only one row of bar seating inside. The kitchen is also in the same space so everything is functional but not fancy. Meant for quick fast food consumption or grab-and-go, so don't expect to be hanging out here for long.  I got the pork katsu burger, since that was the initial attraction. It comes in a shallow pan and dominates the plate. The katsu is two times the size of the bun, sticking out 1-2 inches past the edge of the bread. The base of the bread underneath the katsu has a couple slices of pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. The top of the katsu has a drizzle of the usual dark sauce, a generous clump of tiny sliced cabbage (?) and some type of sauce with color of thousand island dressing. In all, one of the better burgers I've had in a while."}
{"text":"I went with friends and we shared 4 different burgers. All of them were so delicious! Cheese don katsu is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Incredible katsu restaurant with great customer service! I've been a regular customer here for over a year and this place is still my go-to katsu spot. The portions are extremely generous and the chicken is lightly breaded. Wait times have never been an issue and the staff are super welcoming.   The taro chips are also a must!!"}
{"text":"Good portion of the burger, very tasty! I got the don Katsu burger and I got myself the taro chips! This place is near pacific mall, probably 5 mins walking distance from it, the space isn't big but it's good enough to grab a bite and go. If you haven't try this place, give it a try and you will know what I mean about the portion for the pork katsu burger :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight around closing time so there was no one else. We ordered a pork cutlet with yakisoba and the food was ready very quickly.  The pork was thinner than expected, but still moist and flavourful. The noodles were a little on the salty side, but all-in-all we were satisfied with our experience and will probably come back again to try their burgers."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: Self Serve Value: 5 Presentation: 5 Overall: 4.6 rounded up to 5  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. It's been a long time since I last visited this place, but my friend has never tried and wanted to check it out. Let's see what's changed since last time.  We ordered the chicken katsu burger, pork don, gyoza, and taro chips and I have got to say that all of it was very impressive. The burger was huge! It seemed to be a lot bigger than the last time I got it. The chicken was too tender to my tastes. Call me crazy but I like my chicken a bit stiffer. Moving onto the gyoza, they were very well crisped and had the takoyaki bits and sauce on it. The taro chips felt light and were utterly addicting.  This is a fast food place and there is limited seating; approximately 12 seats, so that should be taken into consideration if one plans to eat there.  In total, those 4 things added up to about 32 dollars and we were stuffed. I can say that the burger is really big for the price and the taro chips being $3 per pack is a steal.  Although it is a small an obscure place, it is a must try and is a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Came with some girlfriends: service was fairly fast and friendly, selection was intriguing and the food was awesome-- we all really enjoyed it! I'd like to see them do even more with their menu (as space allows). Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Actually 3.5  After weeks of having it bookmarked, I finally got a chance to check this place out. I ordered the chicken katsu burger ($8.99). The katsu was twice the length of the bun! There was also an extra piece of katsu on the side.   The burger was good. The chicken wasn't dry, it was nicely breaded and crispy. The katsu was nothing exceptional though. It was the same as any chicken katsu that you'd get at a Korean restaurant. I personally thought there was too much coleslaw, but that might just be me. The pickles added a nice contrast to the katsu. The burger was definitely messy to eat! Especially due to the sauces! I was grateful for all the napkins they gave us. There was also a fork given, I had no idea what to do with it. How does one eat a burger with a fork?   The downsides are the lack of seating and parking. The parking lot is small, the spots are tight and it is hard to turn in and out, especially during high traffic times."}
{"text":"Their lightly battered Chicken Katsu is really delicious! I wanted to try their charcoal ice cream but they said they rotate flavours and they make it during summer time."}
{"text":"Very very good katsu!!  They serve big portions in comparison to their price point and it leaves you feeling very very stuffed! I even passed out early from eating their burger lol The staff were extremely friendly and had shown  great attitudes to all the customers in the shop. Although I enjoyed every bite of it, dining in would probably enhance the experience even more as ordering takeout left the food slightly soggy.  Regardless, it is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here since we noticed weeks ago that Big Moe's was gone and that this place had gotten a couple of good reviews. This is located in a tiny plaza on Kennedy, right next to the Petro Canada at Kennedy and Steeles. Parking situation is pretty bad. You could always park at Pacific Mall and walk over though if you're really in a pinch!  This place just opened on Sunday. I would call the decor warehouse chic and everything looked very clean. The decor is definitely a step up from what it used to look like. I'm impressed. This is more of a take out place I would say, there's maybe ten seats and it's all barstools. There are also heaters attached to the ceiling and you can feel it! It was nice.  The owner was so friendly as she greeted us and introduced us to the menu. Their specialty is katsu and she said that they use their own breadcrumbs. You can get it with rice and stir fried or soup noodles. There is also bulgogi and korean pancakes available. Meals are around 9 or 10 dollars.   I got the donkatsu with soup noodles and my boyfriend got the chicken katsu burger. The owner came and gave us our food and even checked in after to see if we liked it. The noodles are like a combination of udon/ramen and the donkatsu was good. There's a bit of zucchini and egg in there. It's a simple and light meal, which is what I was looking for.   The noodles were good, but I was so surprised by my boyfriend's chicken katsu. so. tender. It was unexpected. The outside is crispy without being hard and scratchy - the breadcrumbs definitely make a difference. The inside is so tender and the whole thing was fresh and hot. Definitely try this!! Next time I'll be getting this or rice, rather than the noodles as the breading is probably best eaten when it's not in soup.  She gave us free taro chips with the burger. These were really good - lightly salted with pink Himalayan sea salt, and seasoned with nori and sesame. We got soft serve ice cream after. Flavors available are purple yam and green tea and comes with Pocky and rice krispies. The green tea had quite a strong tea flavor. I liked the purple yam more and the color was really pretty. It was a bit on the icier side, kind of like a Wendy's Frosty. When we mentioned it to the owner, she said that they were trying out different vendors over the weeks and thanked us for letting her know.  Will be back with friends :) Great food, service, and price!"}
{"text":"Aghhh this was so good! I had Korean pancake (eggs, cabbage, something else?) and the bulgogi, both of which I devoured. Also had the matcha soft serve which was strongly flavoured and came with crispy rice puffs which added a welcome textural contrast. I saw other people getting a massive fried chicken sandwich - that also looked delish. I will definitely return.   Parking in this plaza sucks though. Be forewarned."}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly. Limited seating. There is no air conditioning when we went so very stuffy inside. Ordered the pork katsu burger. Huge portions. Pork katsu was sliced thin and fried well. The food was good but its not something that I would crave to come back for."}
{"text":"I went back & tried the cheese don katsu ($11.50). It still comes with rice & coleslaw, only difference is there is mozzarella (assuming) cheese inside of the pork.   It was delicious when first trying it, crispy & juicy. The end pieces don't have as much cheese, so they tasted a lot better. I love cheese but when you get towards the middle pieces it's more like eating a mouthful of cheese as the pork gets lost. It's still good though, I'd recommend sharing. The coleslaw is so good with this dish, as it takes away from the heaviness.   I'd definitely recommend getting a drink on the side. $1 pop cans, and various other drinks."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of all places to eat! If you really enjoy eating Katsu (like myself) this is katsu heaven for you!   This place is located right at the corner along Kennedy and Steeles next to the Petro gas station. Once inside there is only bar seating along the windows. So the place is kind of small with limited seating so not ideal for large groups. The menu has about 14-15 items. Not a large selection but also not too much to not know what you want to order either.   This place specializes in Katsu. So most of the items on the menu contains katsu lol. There are some fried chicken items as well. (Need to try that)   I ordered the pork katsu burger, which takes approximately 10 mins to make. All katsu's prepared are all in house prepped and made upon ordering so it's very fresh. No frozen food here! They also make their own in house breading which is impressive.   The pork katsu is MASSIVE! they give a giant piece of katsu and compresses it into a sandwich. I couldn't even take a full bite, and ended up munching on the katsu and lower bun and everything in between leaving the top bun uneaten. (fail).  The katsu is prepared with alot of effort. It was very crispy and the breading was crunchy. Not soggy or drenched with oil either. The brown from after frying was perfect coloring. Every bite was crispy and flavorful until the end.   One of the best places to eat katsu. It was very delicious and can't wait to try other items.   Heard they will be getting popcorn chicken later on!"}
{"text":"Good: Friendly staff Good food  Bad: Tight parking Not many tables  Food Chicken katsu burger - dark meat 4.5/5 Takoyaki  4.5/5 Gyoza 3/5 Taro Parfait 4.5/5  Overall good experience and the price is on point. Burger was like $9.5  Takoyaki was $5.5 Taro Parfait was $5.5"}
{"text":"The best Katsu place I've ever been to! I would highly highly recommend the chicken Katsu on rice! I've had the pork Katsu but the chicken is sooooo good. Their garlic sauce is so goood and combined with the original or their take on chipotle is just amazing.   Their parking is terrible.... So becareful going in because you might have to do a tight... Really tight 3 point turn.   Best bet would be to call in and do take out as their seating is also limited as well. Like 10 people can sit inside.. maybe."}
{"text":"If you love katsu, this is an awesome place to satisfy your craving in having your choice of eating it in a form of a burger, with rice or noodles! I got the chicken burger katsu and was blown away with the juicy tenderness of the chicken. Was also pleased that I didn't get just 1, BUT 2 pieces of chicken that was fairly large - larger than the burger bun itself. I actually ended up splitting it in half with my dad. The servers there are super friendly and even gave my dad and I a bowl of house made taro chips that were beautifully flavored with nori and sea salt... we ended up buying a bag  They also have various side dishes and other options on the menu which I plan on trying when I come back as I was bummed they sold out on their Korean pizza. The potato croquettes which recommended in place of the pizza were delicious however and enjoyed by both my dad and I.   Only thing I wasn't too please about was the matcha icecream as it lacked creamy-ness and a rich matcha flavor. However, $3 in my opinion was a good price for what it was worth as it was a large packed cone, plus it wasn't a basic cone but a yummy waffle cone."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to try this place and it definitely lived up to the hype!   Located in a smalllllll plaza with very limited parking. If parking is full, just park in the plaza right beside it and walk there.   Small shop with one table that fits 3-4 people facing the open kitchen and bar tables along the windows.   We ordered the chicken katsu burger and katsu rice. The chicken Katsu was huge and can easily make 2 burgers, I believe you can also have them cut it for you and have double layers in your burger. The pork katsu was very nice as while. Both were very flavourful and filling! Came with coleslaw. Food was made fresh and did not take long at all.  We also got to sample the tarp chips! Very delicious  We definitely go back to try the different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious cheese katsu burgers! Stick some of those taro chips into the burger and enjoy that cheesy-crunchy-meaty bite."}
{"text":"A hidden jewel with a simple menu and very warm staff. I prefer chicken over pork katsu. Burger buns is hilarious. You either gonna feel like you're eating a plane or something, or you triple down the meat layer of the burger. Rice is traditional and classy. Gonna try with noodles. Expecting a wow there as well."}
{"text":"Tried the katsu rice and katsu burger here. The katsu is a butterflied piece of meat and it has good crispy texture. I would recommend choosing the rice option as the burger gets a little soggy.  Also had the parfait, and they had taro ice cream that day. The parfait has rice krispies underneath and some torched marshmallows, I found it kind of mediocre, I would rather just get plain ice cream as by itself was good.  Parking is a little bit of a pain as the lot is a bit tight and small."}
{"text":"Although there was a bit of a wait when I got there (the couple in front of me ordered a lot of food) I really enjoyed the food! I ordered two chicken katsu burgers and a chicken katsu rice and taro chips. I would give the food a 4/5 but it was really the service that got me giving this place a 5/5!"}
{"text":"This...place...is...friggen...delicious! Whenever I'm craving a HUGE portion of cut your tongue crispy Pork Katsu, smothered in a delicious Fat Ninja Bite original liquid concoction, with occasional chipotle sauce, and sandwiched between two big buns, this is definitely my go to! It's served with a small cup of creamy coleslaw, which pairs perfectly. I'm not generally a fan of coleslaw, but this one is an exception.  There's a small seating area along the window, so people can watch you scarf down the gigantic piece of deep fried meat into your mouth.   The staff are always so friendly as well! Right when you enter the door, your ears are blasted with the polite sounds of \"Hello!\" and \"Welcome!\". Same politeness when you're leaving as well."}
{"text":"Very little parking spots but it's right where the bus stops are so it's pretty accessible. It's usually full because this place only seats about 8-10 people bar style. The ambience is quite casual but gives you a urban feel. It looks a bit outdated on the outside but it's honestly a gem on the inside; decor wise.   Service is very friendly and the wait for your food is about 5-10 minutes which isn't bad. It is a open kitchen so you can see your food being made while waiting! Better to just do take out instead.   I ordered the chicken katsu noodle soup and it came under $12. The soup base was pretty mediocre and nothing too special, same with the udon noodles. The chicken was deep fried and crispy; the sauce was alright as well. Not much taste to it so I guess the seasoning was just lacking a bit. The texture overall of the chicken was pretty good; not too dry or stale. The portions however, is a very decent size! Wasn't able to finish the chicken or the noodles."}
{"text":"The katsu burger is awkward to eat, and the meat is quite plain and oily as katsu is in general. Bulgogi was okay, but had a very strong sesame seed flavour."}
{"text":"I didn't know they replaced big moes with this place but I think that was a really good decision.  I tried the katsu spicy burger with taro chips. For the price it us definitely worth it the bigger is massive woth a spicy siracha sauce and we also had taro soft serve ice cream which they also make themselves. Everything is fresh you can see them cook the chciken right in front of your eyes. I really like the co cept and the owners are really friendly as well I will definetly come back here"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating... here are the positives:  The portion of the chicken katsu burger was generous. Not only was the katsu double the length of the actual burger buns but there was another katsu portion beside the burger as well! Basically 2 katsu portions for the price of one (perfect for sharing!) and it was crispy as well. I have to say that the price is great for what you get: $8.99 plus tax for dark meat or add another $2 for white meat. The tomato and lettuce on the burger were also fresh. The taro chips for $2.99 were also really good and had just the right amount of seasoning.  The staff were also helpful, friendly and patient as I decided what to order from the menu. There were about 3 of them working there this past weekend when I came in and they worked efficiently considering how busy it got. It was about 15 minutes wait for the order but I didn't mind since my husband and I just snacked on the taro chips while waiting.  For me, this place didn't get a higher rating for the following reasons:  1. The major reason: while the portion size of the chicken katsu burger was awesome, it seemed to lack some seasoning - it was honestly a bit bland. The teriyaki and mayo sauces on the katsu burger unfortunately didn't add that much more taste to it, so I feel the overall flavour could have really been improved. It didn't taste amazing in my opinion, though my husband enjoyed it.  2. Limited seating inside the place with about 10 seats at most. Luckily, we were able to find 2 seats on a Sunday night around 9pm!  3. Limited parking in the plaza. This place is just in an odd location with a narrow entrance way to drive in to and the parking spots fill up fast. We had to wait about 5 minutes to get a spot but I can imagine that it's worse earlier in the evening around dinner time.   I think it's fair to say that this place is worth trying but not sure if I would be a repeat customer with all the amazing options out there."}
{"text":"Came here today with my sister and we ordered the mixed flavour soft serve in a cup. They had black sesame as one of the flavours today! We got the mix of that and ube.  So. Good. The flavours stay true to their names and you can really taste it. Black sesame had a stronger taste than the ube, but they were equally as yummy in taste.  We will definitely be back for their katsu burgers and more soft serve!"}
{"text":"Visited this place quite a few times now and every visit is an enjoyable one, staff are very nice. Always leaving with a happy tummy...burp!   They have chicken or pork katsu with choices of either a burger, with rice or noodle (stir fry or soup).  I always have the chicken katsu burger and request for the spicy mayo, delicious! Makes me wanting to have one now. Chicken portion is so big that they cut some portion and serve it on the side. It comes with coleslaw which is good too.  The place is small and only have a few seats but everytime we manage to be able to dine in. We really love this katsu place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I love this place! The cashier there (Sunny?) is extremely friendly and helpful. She patiently explained the whole menu to me. Here's a breakdown of what I've tried so far:  Classic pancake ($9.99) - A bit on the boring side but I started enjoying it the more bites I took. I thought it's quite pricey based on the ingredients. This wouldn't be on my must try list.  Taro chips ($2.99) - I love taro chips and these were beautifully made. My parents are watching their sodium intake and they thought it was nicely seasoned. I love the touch of seaweed.  Cheese burger ($10.99) - This is a must try item. The breading was so good, it was perfectly deep fried, the lettuce made the burger taste healthier (even though it's not) and the cheese in the middle was amazing. I thought that this was well priced. I would come back just for this.  Korean wedding noodle ($7.99) - Just a head's up, there's no meat in this noodle. I thought it'll be bland when I first saw it but I surprisingly enjoyed this dish. The shitake mushrooms were so good because it was marinated in some sweet sauce. The thin noodles had a nice consistency to it.  Sweet potato (ube) ice cream ($3.50) - This was so good! It's so hard to find ube ice cream. The cashier told me that the powder they used to make the ice cream is from Korean. She looked for a powder that didn't have added colour and sugar so it can be healthier. The ice cream had a nice ube flavour and the crunch of the cereal added a nice texture to the dessert.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different and this place happened to be near our friend's store and had some good reviews. After reading all of the reviews, I really wanted to try their chicken katsu burger. Just as promised, it was super large (part of the chicken has to be cut off because it won't fit in the bun, which still has meat hanging out anyways), and the chicken is moist and the breading is amazingly crunchy! I forgot to mention that the bun they use is nice and soft. It also comes with a tiny side of coleslaw (which I wish came with more because it's creamy and tasty). We also ordered a bag of their freshly made taro chips...I loved them! So tasty and crispy!  My husband ordered the pork katsu noodles and they were tasty as well. The pork katsu comes on the side (I assume to keep it crispy) and both the meat and noodles are a fair size of a portion. I personally liked the chicken more because it was so moist, but it's not their fault, as pork is a very difficult meat to keep moist and tender.   Overall, I definitely want to come back and try their bulgogi burger and their soft serve ice cream. Lastly, they have very pleasant customer service, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Not a restaurant per se although there are a limited number of seats if you wanted to eat in. This place specializes in chicken and pork katsu. You can get it on rice or as a burger. The portion is huge for what you pay. Not surprisingly, it also left me very thirsty so be ready to grab a drink too.  It was definitely delicious katsu but given the venue, I feel like it's more geared towards pick-up, and I'm personally not sure I'd want deep-fried meat for take-out... stop by if you're around."}
{"text":"First impression of the space of the restaurant is fairly small. Two long communal tables stretch along the window and sides of the dining space- 13 chairs available to sit and the space for parking is very narrow and limited.   Very busy place, steady flow of people coming in on a Sunday for lunch or picking up their take out orders. I even saw a couple of people eating the burgers in their car. That's how good it is!   The food is pretty good. It's very filling - dependent on appetite you may be able to split a sandwich between two people. After we ordered our burgers (one pork and one chicken) we were lucky to find space to stand by the communal table and eat. Lots of napkins in baskets for those messy nibblers.   I got the don katsu burger with the sliced cabbage, pickles, tomato and lettuce between sesame bun. Many people purchased a bag of their fried taro chips to nibble along with their burger but, I was saving space for their soft serve icecream!  Each component of the burger worked well together and was delicious. You can ask for extra katsu sauce on the side or even request for their spicy sauce to go with your order! The katsu breading is fried to nice crispy exterior while the pork stayed very tender and super easy to cut through with a plastic knife. The meal was ridiculously filling and tasty ($9.50) meal.   Soft serve icecream time! Unfortunately they only had Taro flavour on supply , but I still ordered a cup of soft serve anyway! The taro icecream was smooth and the colour of the icecream was a beautiful shade of lavender purple. ($3.50) The rice crisps cereal at the bottom of the cup added a nice crunch to compliment the soft serve icecream. Breakfast and dessert together. :)"}
{"text":"I live way up in Brampton but would drive all the way to scarborough just for this place. Their chicken katsu sandwiches are just one of a kind and I would go here again and again!"}
{"text":"Fat ninja bite has been my go to take out place for the past month. It is a small take out restaurant with high top seating, located in the small strip plaza  south of Steeles and east of Kennedy Road. It can be easy to miss when you are driving by and the parking situation can give you a  bit of a headache at peak times, but I assure you it is well worth it. What keeps me coming back to this joint is the friendly and welcoming atmosphere the owner and her chef provides to their customers.   So far, I've tried the Pork Katsu Rice, the Chicken Katsu Burger, and the Taro Chips. The food is always made to order so everything was always piping hot and fresh. The pork and chicken katsu was lightly seasoned, juicy, and was perfectly crispy.  The portions are also HUGE! I was so shocked at how big the cutlet was when I opened the takeout box. Great for sharing. The taro chips were salted lightly and crunchy.   Would definitely come back again when I am in the area when I am craving for cheap and filling Japanese/Korean food."}
{"text":"Super hyped up by a few friends. Very friendly staff, easy to find location. I got the dark chicken meat katsu with rice. The price is FAIR /good for a cheap meal! I can in hungry but couldn't  finish the rice. It was packed hard. I just felt like eating the chicken which was very juicy and tender. I wish the katsu was more crispy/dry. Only the end peices were crispy and I ate it right away in the restaurant. The coleslaw was okay, not bad. The spicy mayo was nothing special. I added it to the rice to make it more palatable. Overall, I would not go out of my way to go there but wouldn't mind going again. I think the burger would taste better. The rice was too dry and plain.... The burger would obviously have half the amount of chicken for the same price but would probably taste better overall. I also couldn't really taste what the sauce on the katsu was. I asked the person working there if it was curry. He said they chose not to use curry because not many people enjoy curry due to the strong flavours/taste in curry and that their plain sauce is more tolerated by the majority."}
{"text":"Clean open environment. Decent floor plan for quick dine in. The staff are friendly, everyone gets that warm \"Hello\" greeting, reminds me of Guu.   - Ordered the Chicken Katsu Burger ( dark meat ) Fried thin chicken cutlet well seasoned and breaded. Asides from the type of meat the dark meat variant is longer where the white meat shorter with two katsu's stacked.    Chicken katsu is a 5/5 alone. Asides from the ridiculous size it was fried perfectly with plenty of sauce. You will be satisfied eating the katsu by itself, which is what I had to do for the protruding ends.    The bun is typical sesame toasted, with tomato, pickles, lettuce, cabbage, with teriyaki and south western-ish sauce.   Requested spicy, would recommend.   Overall the katsu (cutlet) is worth the price. Eating as a sandwich is great, everything goes together. My only annoyance is the filler with the cabbage and the coleslaw wasn't that great. That said would recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"we walked in and the first thing the owner did was great us with an amazing smile! she went into introducing the menu to us and she made it sound absolutely phenomenal. the specialize in katsu with burgers or noodles or rice. The breading is all homemade and the portions were on point. The chicken I got was super juicy and tender with a crispy layer of batter that gave it a tasty crunch. Came with taro chips (seasoned with Himalayan salt+ seaweed+sesame) and coleslaw. it only opened up this sunday! it's more of a quick bite location as the only seating was along a bar sorta table with stool. the ice cream comes on either green tea or purple yam, both really good! I'm definitely going to be going back ;)"}
{"text":"Despite its location and the pick-n-go style design, this place could be described as more than what meets the eye.   Before we start on the food, this place has better service than 60-70% of the restaurants I walk into. It may be the fact that they're new, but nonetheless, the service really really brightens the whole experience right off the bat.   The Chicken Katsu Burger was definitely the best item I had amongst the items I tried on the menu. The chicken was juicy and moist, and the condiments that went with the burger struck a good balance for what some may call a mild meal. Though the price may throw a couple people off, the food is definitely worth every penny paid.   I found the Don Katsu a little dry, but the flavor was still on point. We also had the Bulgogi Burger, which was very satisfying as well.   For those who are looking for a more Korean kick to their meal, their Kimchi coleslaw and the Korean Pancakes are something I would definitely recommend.   To top things off, their cute little cup-sized Purple Yam ice cream was light and quite tasty.  Overall, I am very impressed by this business, and will continue to visit to see how they develop. Definitely an exciting new spot to try."}
{"text":"Okay let me ask you something... who in their right mind orders a machine from Korea to grind there own freaking bread crumbs that is made from a bakery that bakes bread specifically made to order for them????  The people behind Fat Ninja Bite that's who!!!  I've been seeing way too many delicious pics of the Katsu Burger from this joint that I decided to stop in today.  Right away you are greeted by the friendly owner and a quick overview the small and simple menu.  Small simple menus are always a great sign of quality over quantity.  Like a man on a mission, right away I went for the White Meat Chicken Katsu Burger.  The burger is huge and took me a while figure out how best to attack this oversized piece of deliciousness.  F*CK ME it was good!!!!  The in house bread crumbs fried up nicer then store bought panko and the chicken was really tender and not dry even though it was white meat.  The bun was really soft and light.  The katsu sauce along with the special mayo, pickles, tomato, lettuce all really worked beautifully together...this ain't your parent's McChicken burger!  While there do yourself a big favour and grab the fried taro chips...Made fresh daily and seasoned beautifully with salt, seaweed and seasame seeds.  I wanted to eat the entire thing right there but knew I better save some for the family or I would get an earful!  Its a small store and has bench seating for about 8-10 people.  The only downside is the parking is really small and shared with other stores.  You might need to park at Pacific Mall and walk down.  Damn you Fat Ninja Bite!  You are gonna make me into a Fat Guy with all the food I'll be eating!!! Haha!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I had the Katsu burger and it was amazing. One of the best chicken burgers I've ever had. Staff and customer service is on point. Overall very good cleanliness. Worth every penny spent and will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute and small fast food Korean restaurant at Kennedy and Steeles. It is a very busy area so it is easy to miss the little joint. They serve Korean food but in a fast food type style so there is limited seating. The quality of the food is very good and the portions are generous. The prices are very reasonable too. I would definitely recommend their fried porkchop burger and for anyone to try this joint. The staff is very friendly and polite as well!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, this place deserves it.  Ordered a Don (Pork) Katsu Burger - because i wanted it cheese. Chicken Katsu doesn't have cheese option.  The Katsu was humongous, it was twice the size of the bun. The mozzarella cheese was oozing out of the burger! Meat was tender, outside was perfectly deep fried was care and precision and then left on paper towel to remove excess oil. Watching the chef make the Katsu reminded me of the care and precision of a Japanese sushi chef! Only one complaint, the bun was toasted but still cold while the Katsu was fresh and hot..  Taro chips ($2.99) are made in house and tastes yummy, portion was not small and not big.  I know a Japanese izakya place where they serve taro chips 100% fresh for $4.99 and a bigger portion... nevertheless, still worth a try at this place! Taro chips were 3.5 to 4 stars.  The Don Katsu burger was $10.99 (menu has a typo $9.99).  Meal was super delicious and wasn't short on its 5 star reputation!   Service was amazing, both the chef and cashier!  I'll be back to try other burgers on their small menu."}
{"text":"Tip:  Parking lot is literally a one-way.  So you may find yourself in a predicament if someone else is trying to exit.  If you do go, it's better if you have a back-up cam on your car!!!  First, I noticed that it was literally an all-younger males in their 20s-type patron sitch here.  I'm used to being around guys, but I felt a bit weird being the only female here.  Seating is stools + a counter.  So do not bring a date here or expect a romantico night out on the town!  Like other reviewers have mentioned, there is a good 10-15mins wait 'cause I'm guessing they make the food to order (??).  To sum up, this place is a katsu place with a simple menu that only has a few items, burger (either pork, chicken dark/white)/rice/noodle & a coupla other items.  Apparently they also have ice cream or soft serve, but I did not see that behind the counter or anyone eating that.   Burger LOOKS big, but that's because the meat is tenderised soo much that it's spread out.  I may have been able to eat the entire thing if I was hungrier.  However, I just ate the slaw, extra piece on the side, & hanging meat off the bun and took the rest to-go.  After I couldn't finish things, I realised why the majority of the patrons were younger guys!  My only thing I could say was that I wish that the meat wasn't as thin because I couldn't really taste it.  Like other reviewers said, don't bother upgrading to White meat 'cause you probably won't know the diff.  :)"}
{"text":"I had to write a review after my third visit.  Would had never found this gem if not for Yelp. This gem is beside the Petro station at the South East corner of Kennedy and Steeles.  I have tried their chicken katsu burger and chicken katsu rice. Both delicious dishes. The chicken katsu burger is humongous! Be prepared to be stuffed.The chicken katsu is always fresh and perfectly battered regardless of which dish you order.  Food may take some time to prepare, as each dish is prepared fresh. Quality has been consistent for all three visits.   The plaza has a relatively smaller parking lot, so I personally like to go during off hours. Either before or after the lunch rush.  Don't forget to try their Taro chips!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu burger. First of all, they give really generous servings for the price. The chicken katsu burger came with an extra katsu. I've had my fair share of katsu and this was one of the better ones. Fair price for the quality and quantity of food. Only negative was the wait time for our food. It took about 25 min to get our food after ordering."}
{"text":"Located across from Pacific Mall, it's hidden pretty well that I turned into the wrong tiny lot and had to reverse out during rush hour traffic!! It is the entrance that is right before the Shell Gas Station.  I had this place bookmarked forever and finally got the chance to try it! Got the Katsuya burger and a bag of taro chips. The burger was MASSIVE, I was pretty hungry and was inly able to finish about 70% of it! You really want to be hands on with this burger and get messy because the pork is just so huge. The sauce complements the katsuya and every bite is super satisifying. The taro chips were so good too, seaweed coated taro chips, how can one say no to that? They also have samples of the chips at the cash if you are unsure about it!  The dudes working here are so enegertic, they made sure we had everything we needed and made sure we are happy with the food. Lots of happy and positive vibes!"}
{"text":"Fat Ninja is a cute little spot for Katsu across pacific mall on Kennedy. First thing to note is that parking is very limited as is seating. There are probably 10 chairs in total and is more of a take-out spot.  That being said, I got there at about 2pm and managed to get a seat at the end of the counter. I ordered a katsu burger with cheese and one with noodles. Both of them were absolutely fantastic. The crispyness of the breading with the tender pork was awesome, combined with the gooey cheese oozing out.  The food combined with the friendly staff - This place is a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great place ! The burger is massive and super yummy. I got both the katsu burger and green tea ice cream Soft serve.  it did not disappoint. Will be back !  Note: the place fills up and there is limited seating (7 seats or so individual seats) and small parking lot."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm very impressed. Employees were very kind and didn't mind taking the extras off my katsu and rice. Dinner for two came out to around $25 which isn't bad at all for the portions. I will come back and I recommend you try this place too!!!"}
{"text":"I think I just found my newest place for pork katsu! The pork is fried nicely and remains tender and juicy! The flavor is excellent.  I tried the Pork Katsu Burger and absolutely loved it. The piece of pork you get is huge! The coleslaw that you get on the side is also good to add into the burger!  For $10 the price is pretty good value and I do want to come back to try their rice and noodles. The location is not the greatest as there are very few seats to sit down and eat. Parking is also extremely limited and tight.  Highly recommended regardless!"}
{"text":"Food was 4.5 star. It's delicious but they used the same fried batter for chicken and pork, so little difference in the taste. I ordered noodle and portion size is reasonable. Minus 0.5 star for minimal number of parking spaces"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want your Katsu fix! I ordered a Chicken Katsu burger and it was quite large and delicious. Don't forget to grab a bag of their Taro chips because they are home made and fantastic. The dumplings though are not homemade...they are just store bought and placed into the deep fryer. Their specialty is their Katsu so if are there hoping to get something else you will be out of luck. They seating is quite limited so be prepared to do take out if you cannot find a seat."}
{"text":"This place has some got burger game going on. Their katsu burger is good and tasty and its also fresh which is always good. The cashier and cook are super friendly. The place is a little bit small for bigger groups which can sometimes deter group outings but other than that is good. Their taro chips is always a must order item if you can get it since they run out of it very often."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a little plaza south of Steeles Ave on the east side of Kennedy Rd. If I hadn't seen it on Yelp with all the positive reviews, I'd have never known it was there. That would have been a shame, the service was very friendly and the portions were quite big.   My friend and I each got the katsu burger, very nicely plated with coleslaw on the side. Pleasing to the eyes and the palate. With nice juicy pieces of chicken, shredded cabbage and some nice sauce to top it off.   Have been back since my first visit and again was very pleased and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing...fat ninja gets my seal as the best chicken burger joint I've ever been to! Chicken...bc I haven't had the pork.  Our experience was last night was fantastic, this is a small family run spot you can actually the family cooking behind you on a stove...doesn't get any better. The beef dumplings were so tasty without being overly oily and we're smothered in a tangy korean bbq sauce, the small size is best if you plan to have a burger.  Now the burger...holy crap its huge but that's because they take care to pound the chicken thin so it's moist and tasty. The breading was light and incredible and the burger was dressed in cabbage, which I love...extra crunch n healthy! It was filling without being total gluttony.  The tarp chips are light and airy, we (mostly me? devoured the bag!  My boyfriend and I enjoyed our visit so much and cannot wait to go again. I'd like to try the pancake next time. Bonus: we grabbed a burger to go for my boyfriends dad, who can be a tough critic... he devoured it!   The downside: parking! Be patient and careful the Plaza is TINY!  RUN TO DAT NINJA YOU WON'T REGRET!!!"}
{"text":"My meal - chicken katsu burger. Lightly battered, crispy, juicy, chicken katsu cutlet eaten in the style of a burger that sticks out on both sides of the bun!   Tonkatsu sauce, mayo and cabbage round out the flavours and textures on the bun.  Notes: I couldn't finish my burger...perhaps share as I can never re-heat katsu back to its former glory!  Parking can be very difficult as there are limited spots. Best to park elsewhere ( maybe P mall) and walk over or visit during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"We ordered catering about 1 week ago and was not disappointed. The Katsu was cooked to perfection and the variety of sauces included were delicious. It was nice for them to include utensils and plates for us. I highly recommend the taro chips as they were simply the star of the show. Nice and crispy, flavourful and tasty. We also ordered the kimchi slaw and I felt it was just average. It was maybe even too spicy for my liking. Overall, great catering experience and will most likely return."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because of all the hype on Yelp. The restaurant is quite small - it focuses primarily on takeout, though there are a few seats if you want to eat in. The staff is friendly, and the space is welcoming - nice windows and upbeat music.  The food, while fine, certainly wasn't remarkable. I got the don katsu burger, which was basically just a fried, breaded pork cutlet between two buns. I also tried the dumplings, which were oily and not super flavorful. This place has a lot of 5-star reviews, so clearly there are many people who love it. But I'm not one of them."}
{"text":"Like I said before. Closer to a 4 than a 3. But a 3.5 is where I would be. Small spot with great nori chips. Their chicken katsu burger is the best thing here.....  but not a fan of the bread. Too ....  dry and flaky."}
{"text":"Wow. This place sums up one of the things I love about Toronto. Awesome fusion food. The staff were super friendly. We had pork and chicken katsu burgers. They are absolutely delicious. Next time I will probably share half a burger because it is so huge. The dumplings were pretty good too. They come with seafood flakes on top so if you don't like the smell of the flakes you may want to ask for the dumplings without them. We also ordered the taro chips but we were too full to eat them yet. Next time I am looking forward to trying the ice cream. It is a small place and I think we just missed the huge lunch crowd so keep the wait in mind. The parking lot is also tiny so you may want to scout out some alternate parking locations when you go."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new  on a late night Saturday. Saw the reviews for this place and they are definitely well deserved.  The staff was very nice and came around to ask how the food was and some small talk. They even brought our food around but that was most likely cause it was slow at the time (close to closing).  My girlfriend got the cheese Don () katsu burger. One bit into it and the cheese was flowing out. I myself got the chicken burger and for the price and portions I would come back. We also got ice cream in a cup and I believe** they upgraded it to a parfait (pictures for what I asked for looked different)  who knows. But if they did, it was a friendly gesture on their part.  I could imagine during peak hour that it can get busy and theres not much space for sitting (8 stools). Same goes for parking (insert horror emoji).  Overall though, definitely would recommend and definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Delicious meal. The chicken teriyaki burger was delicious and I noticed how it was hanging because of the size of the meat. I will come here again to try the other items."}
{"text":"This place is as they say \"the bomb\" ! Brought a group to try this place out and I was very happy with my selection. Their Katsu (either chicken or pork) sandwich is their specialty. It's one big sandwich with the Katsu as the patty that's well worth every bit of your $8.99. Quality in every bite! or should I say crumb as they have their bread crumbs made especially for them. The KimChi Coleslaw is homemade by one of the staff/ owner's wife which has home cook comfort food written all over it (he's one lucky husband ;)). Delicious! For dessert we got the ube softserve in a cup which ties the deal because its soft serve with rice crispies at the bottom (author just died and went to heaven). Service was just as good as the food warm and sunny friendly you'll forget you live in Toronto (not!) But seriously these guys will do anything to make your experience great with the food. Tiny joint place though so if you're a big group I suggest take out. We were a group of 12 and we were lucky to have the place mostly to ourselves where we got to eat albeit some were standing up. truly a gem! I just have so many good things to tell but I think its best you go and try them out yourselves, just get ready to open your mouths wiiiide!"}
{"text":"I came here last Friday, looking forward to trying the chicken katsu burger, after reading so many favourable reviews. I came at around 8 pm and the limited seating was all taken.   However, there was no line up.   I ordered the chicken katsu burger with dark meat. If you want white meat, it's extra. I attempted to order taro chips and was told that they ran out - so disappointed! I also wanted to order ice cream in a cup, but was told I could only get the taro flavour.  So go earlier if you want to be able to get everything you want off the menu without being told that they've run out of specific items.  It took about 15-20 minutes for my chicken katsu burger to be ready but it was well worth the wait! First of all, the burger was quite large. I was unable to finish. But it was delicious! The chicken was light and the coating was crispy - I enjoyed it thoroughly. I also really liked my taro ice cream. It wasn't too sweet.   I look forward to returning and trying other menu items. Next time, I'll come earlier though."}
{"text":"This is a not so secret gem!   Hidden away in a nondescript strip plaza, this place is awesome, creative and definitely worthwhile to checkout even though it's a bit hard to get to coming from the north side of steeles. Parking is also a bit of a nightmare, there aren't a lot of spots and cars seem to be parked everywhere. We were lucky to get what looked like the last spot.   Given the ratings of this place, we were also lucky enough to get some seats. This place is more of a takeout spot with only a bar and about 7-8 benches for those who want to have a quick bite.   We loved the don Katsu Burger we had here! The meat is tender and the breading is perfectly light and crisp, we didn't find it greasy or heavy at all. The sandwich is dressed with tomato, lettuce, cabbage, katsu sauce and some other creamy sauce, I wasn't sure what it was but it was delicious. The Burger is only $8.99 and the meat is completely busting out on all sides of the bun, like the pictures show, it also comes with coleslaw which is nice and creamy and crunchy.   We also tried the bulgogi beef with rice which comes with coleslaw and, while this was also delicious, not as memorable as the sandwich.   A meal for two cost us only around $23 and some change and was more than enough food. I see they also have ice cream in some more exotic flavours which I'd love to try next time.   Although a bit out of the way, I'd definitely come back to this place to have the sandwich and maybe try the noodles or soups!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken katsu burger and rice option. Very generous portion of katsu. Super crispy crunch on the outside and moist on the inside. :)"}
{"text":"What better way to celebrate Father's Day than to have an amazing \"Tonkatsu\" or \"Donkatsu\" lunch.  Since this is a Korean place, they refer it as a Donkatsu which is a breaded deep-fried pork cutlet originally from Japan.  Since Katsu is my husband's favorite food, it was a perfect place to bring him here for Father's Day.  The food was absolutely amazing!  My daughter and I shared the Chicken Katsu with rice and my husband got the Donkatsu sandwich.  It was so so good!  The portions were huge especially the Don Katsu sandwich.  We also finished off with the purple yam ice cream parfait.  My daughter really wanted the green tea flavour which they didn't have.  The 2 flavours were sesame or purple yam ice cream which she didn't think that she would like.  The lady serving us at the time was nice to give some for her to try so it made it easy for her to go with the purple yam flavour which she ended up loving it.  Keep in mind that this place is not a sit-down restaurant.  There is one long bar table along the window which seats about 9 people.  We were very lucky to get 3 seats.  The parking is also ridiculously small so parking is the other problem. The staff was super friendly and place was super clean.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja has been on my to-try list for a long time. Finally, I had a chance to visit.   The entrance is at the back of the store. Parking space in the tiny plaza is very limited and tight, but you can park at Petro-Canada parking lot if you stay less than an hour.   First of all, the young lady who took the order was very friendly. Later on, she noticed I was running out of sauce and offered me more.   In term of food, they were freshly made upon you order, and they came pretty quickly. The Katsu Burger is huge. It consists of two big Katsu. They were deep fried very nicely, crispy while not oily and meat was still juicy. I really enjoyed it! It is one of the best Katsu I had in Toronto so far.   I also tried the Seafood pancake. The batter was very soft. It was decent.   Soft serve was a nice dessert. Although I wish the Matcha tasted stronger, it was delightful.   I will definitely go back for more Katsu burger, Katsu rice, Katsu noodles. I heard the Taro chips should not be missed."}
{"text":"[SERVICE] - 5/5 Service was amazing! This place has the most friendly staff out of all the fast-food restaurants I've been to!   [DÉCOR] - 4/5  They added a table in front of the front counter for patrons who want to enjoy their fresh katsu at this place.   [QUALITY] - 5/5 Very fresh and high-quality katsu. Tasted quite authentic in comparison to the ones in Japan!   [ORDER] - 5/5 - Dark Meat Chicken Katsu Rice - $9.50: chicken meat was juicy and perfectly deep fried with a minimum amount of grease. Paired very well with rice and coleslaw.  - Cheese Don Katsu (Pork) Rice - $11.50: cheese was deliciously melty and gooey inside the deep fried don katsu. Also complemented rice and coleslaw very well.  [OVERALL] - 5/5 I finally got a chance to try the infamous katsu from this place! I was blown away and would definitely recommend the chicken karsu and cheese don katsu for their tender meats, crispy outer layers, and delicious flavours."}
{"text":"Will return for their burgers!  A small, neat little place right across from Market Village, a few steps behind the gas station.  There's very very limited seating here so either come with a friend or two, or get take out. It's somewhat self-served; your order at the cashier, and pick up your order at the front.   I'm glad their restaurant is mainly glass/windows otherwise there's really nothing much to see there. Their menu is small but you get all the good stuff so that's what matters!  Had their chicken katsu burger and classic korean pancake. Their chicken katsu (heart eyes) was very light and crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The serving was a nice size too; the chicken was so big it was sticking out from both ends of the burger. The order also comes with coleslaw which wasn't too salad-dressingy like most places can be. Would def order that again.  The pancake. A good size between 2-3 people. Nice and thin and comes with a slightly chilly oil sauce to put on top. Adds some kick to the pancake.  I will be back, chicken katsu..."}
{"text":"Delicious & affordable food. I had the don katsu with rice. The katsu was definitely the star of the show, crispy yet tender. Wish there was more katsu sauce on the side, because the rice gets kind of bland. The coleslaw was light and added a great texture to the katsu.  I think if they add more sides (like vegetables) for the rice meals, I would enjoy it more.  And of course, I've tried the taro and black sesame soft serve and it's very good. Smooth and creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. You can definitely taste the flavor of the taro and black sesame.  A good place to go if you don't want to eat at the crowded Pmall food courts. Seating is limited but most people get take out anyways."}
{"text":"The good: everything. I ordered the don katsu cheese burger and it was huge! I loved it. The katsu is done well with a perfect amount of breading and meat in between. It comes with coleslaw too.   We ordered take out and they missed one of our orders which was the dumplings. When we went back, they were very nice and offered a few more to make up for it. The dumpling flavours were delicious - can't decide which one is better! The service is wonderful. Absolutely friendly staff.   The bad: limited seating. Takes about 10-15 mins to make but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place has such a high rating.   Food: AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Yes, it's heavy so would not recommend this place if you are trying to lose weight for your big day. Otherwise, do go try it.   I got Katsu on rice. The batter is crispy and has a good amount of meat.  My fiance got Katsu burger. Here is a useful tip for eating this burger avoiding a big mess.  CUT THE MEAT IN HALF, THEN STACK THEM. BITE INTO IT.  I actually liked the burger over mine. Amazing sauce.   Will be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great katsu here- crispy and juicy! I got the burger and my gf got the udon (which also came with katsu). I was surprised at how huge the katsu was and it was most definitely filling. Udon soup was delicious.   The store is in a small plaza beside pacific small. Seats are very limited as well as parking."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the best part of my experience was the service. The owner was helpful, informative, and very friendly. She even gave us some complimentary taro chips to snack on while we waited. They taste similar to cassava chips, but with a bit of a sweetness and  roasted seaweed flavour. Also note that this is more of a take-out spot. While there is a bit of seating area, this is not a sit down restaurant.  We had the kimchi-slaw to start, bulgogi noodles, chicken katsu burger and ended with matcha ice cream. The food is unique and definitely tasty. But what stands out the most is the katsu burger. I have to say that for $9, this burger was massive. I didn't know where to start. At first it seems weird to eat katsu on a bun but it's definitely something you need to try. The outside was crispy, and the inside tender. It actually combines so well with the tomatoes and pickles. Make sure you ask for extra pickles, the sourness cuts very well with the katsu.  The location may be less than ideal, but the service and that katsu burger is what's going to keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service, and bang for your buck. I got the chicken burger and seafood pancake. Both were delicious and large. I will definitely be going back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Tiny little shop just south of Pacific mall by the gas station. Not a recommended place for groups but a very nice quirky place that gives you an authentic  Japanese feel. Think of the little ramen shops in Japan where the salary man comes in, sits down by himself orders his food, eats, and goes. Service was excellent.  Onto the food.  There were taro chip samples at the front counter, pretty good, lots of flavour despite its boring taro look. A bit salty though.  We ordered a don katsu burger, a chicken katsu noodle, and takoyaki(spicy).  The don katsu burger was massive and comes with a small side of coleslaw. From the Katsu to the bun, it was surprisingly very light which is Nige when you're eating a burger.  The chicken katsu noodle was quite good. Chicken katsu served on the side so that it doesn't get soggy, broth was very clear and healthy tasting.  I really enjoyed the takoyaki. It's hard to screw it up. Perfect bite sized balls of awesomeness.  Would definitely come again and try the ice cream as well."}
{"text":"Ordered: - bulgogi stir fried noodles  -taro chip  Expectations: None  Reality: Pretty small place with friendly staff. Noodles were good and the taro chip was amazing. Would go back just for those!"}
{"text":"Finding takeout is no easy task when you are new to the game of take outs. Before baby: go anywhere at any time. After baby: where can i get fast take out that's within 30 seconds of me that doesn't taste like a$$ after sitting in a takeout container (e.g., pho), doesn't require you get 10 dishes to feel like you've had properly what the cuisine had to offer (most chinese food), tastes \"wow\" and not just \"meh\", doesn't require you to wait forever but also not fast food.   I know i am asking for a lot here, but i live in a country that serves terrible ethnic food so i needed this indulgence while i'm back in canada (\"our home and native land!\"), where the real american dream for food exists.  I'm sure plenty of these businesses are around, it's just that im so new at this that it was really chore to find them! Fat Ninja Bite fit the profile almost perfectly except that there is no parking while you wait, and the food is decent but definitely not amazeballs.  They fry the katsu chicken and pork cutlets in front of you, and the size of the them is huge. But flavour-wise, it was pretty unmemorable. We also had a soup udon and a bulgogi rice dish that i would totally avoid.   All in all, the taste of the food does not warrant a trip back in order to fight the tiny parking lot and the lack of seating if you wanted to eat there. But if you are in the neighbourhood, it's worth a walk."}
{"text":"Burgers with a Japanese and Korean twist!  Tired of the same old burger with your standard toppings like lettuce, tomatoes and cheese? Fat Ninja takes the concept of burger but transforms in to a fusion of Japanese and Korean flavors. On the outside, the place looks a bit odd in a small little strip plaza that is south of Pacific Mall where the parking is extremely limited. But the search is definitely worth the effort. As you walk inside, it is simple modern looking place - bar seating around the outside and a view of the grill. On the menu - you'll have choices of pork, chicken or beef bulgogi burgers or you can also order them as plates. I have been fortunate enough to try the all of them and I can say you can't go wrong with any of them - just come hungry :)  For the katsu, you get an gigantic pork and chicken katsu that is freshly made and deep fried in front of you. It is served on a soft bun with a crunch slaw on it. Amazing taste!  For the beef, it is sorta like a cross between a pulled pork sandwich where the beef is tender and tangy with the sauce.  Don't forget the taro chips - much better than fries where they are crispy and salted with a hint of seaweed. You can also buy packs of them to take home.  Overall - Fat Ninja Bite is great place to go and amazing taste - a new Asian twist on the American burger!. Highly recommend and it is on my \"go to\" list!"}
{"text":"First things first, parking is tough.  Otherwise, the food's great! The katsu is a very generous portion, whether it be the rice or the burger, and the batter is light and fluffy! For under ten dollars, it's a pretty well valued meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out: Cheese don katsu over rice Bulgogi noodle soup Sweet potato soft serve  By the time we got home, we realized that they got our order wrong. Cheese don katsu burger instead of rice so -1 star for that   The noodle soup was more sweet than savory. Didn't like it much.   Katsu and soft serve were delicious and portions are generous."}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of good reviews for Fat Ninja Bites, so we went there on a Tuesday afternoon.  The place it self is very small, so im assuming its more of a take out joint than anything else. But within those small confides they manage to make awesome food.  Their offerings are very limited and straight forward, which is a good thing.  We got the taro chips, takoyaki, don katsu with rice, chicken katsu with rice, chicken katsu burger.  Taro chips: they are amazing, very good crunch and seasoning. And its made fresh in house! Very addictive.  Takoyaki: very tasty, a little more dense than i would but still a very good snack/appetizer  Chicken katsu/ katsu don with rice: both equally good, good crunch, well seasoned and breaded and good portion size.  Chicken katsu burger: this is what everybody raves about, not just becasue it taste good but of its size.  The chicken katsu  was double the size of the actual bun, it was sticking out of both sides.  In terms of taste it was perfect, good seasoning, perfectly breaded, and perfect crunch. It was still moist in the inside.  Overall it was a good idea to visit this joint, and would recommend if your in the area."}
{"text":"Fat Ninja Bite is an Asian fusion style hot spot situated near a busy intersection in the Scarborough/Milliken neighbourhood. While the surrounding area is greatly influenced by Asian culture, this Korean and Japanese street food-inspired restaurant brings a new flavour that will hopefully stick around for a good while.   Located at Kennedy & Steeles, they've completely transformed the space formerly occupied by Big Moe's burger joint and have given it a modern look and feel that suits the theme. Staff are courteous and friendly and seem to genuinely care about each customer that walks in.  I couldn't resist sampling the Chicken Katsu Burger on my first visit, and wasn't disappointed. It's not something I could see myself ordering every day, but as a food adventurer I'm not mad at crispy sandwich that boasts a 3:1 meat to bun ratio.   So far I'd give the food a 3.75 but the service is definitely a 5.5 out of 5. I'm still curious about the bulgogi and some other items they offer, and the cole slaw was rather tasty and satisfying (even for a small portion). For those on the east side of town looking for something a bit different than the usual, this is a place you may want to check out."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Food: Best burger! A monstrous piece of katsu spanning twice the size of its soft sesame bun.  Perfect flavour, texture, and sauce.  Chicken or pork, both great. 2. Service: Always friendly!  Neutral: 1. Taro chips: A little on the bland side, needs a little more salt or seasoning.  Worth it? Definitely!  Unique burger concept that is simple and just works.  I would come back over and over again."}
{"text":"Food 10/10: my go-to place for takeout besides fast food like Mc D. You can never go wrong here! Every item they have is brilliant  Amazing Customer Service: the guy who's always there is always so energetic and friendly, I feel bad for not being as hyped as he is!  Wait Time: Depends on the people ahead of you, but they never slack and you get your food as you watch them make it. Never too long a wait :)"}
{"text":"Ordered through Skip the Dishes. I tried the chicken donKatsu with rice and pork donkatsu burger and kimchi salad. Don katsu was meaty and crispy (as it should be) and the kimchi was nice on a bed of spicy cabbage with sesame oil. Very worth the price. Would prefer this over McDonalds any day!!!"}
{"text":"A great little tiny spot, Some of the best Japanese food I've had!! I just visited this place for the first time after reading some good reviews about it, so I took a friend and decided to check out, and boy was I glad I did! I tried white meat chicken katsu on rice, you get these two massive chicken breasts breaded with panko, slowly deep fried, with a big side of steamed jasmine rice and a cool coleslaw! all this for $11.99! it's too big that I struggled to finish it, and it tastes amazing. I will definitely come back here, and I recommend it to anyone who's into Japanese food.  the place is small, only takes about 10-15 ppl max, and their menu is very limited, with only 4 or 5 main dishes, with every dish selection of pork, chicken, some fish, some beef.."}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service, and delicious food.   A small restaurant just south of Pacific Mall serving amazing burgers. My wife and I both had the chicken burgers and it was amazing. The dark meat chicken was tender and moist with a light crispy chicken. The burger had a delicious array of vegetables and sauces, and comes with an extra chicken filet plus small side of coleslaw.   Neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Deep Fried Goodness!!  I tried the Chicken (Dark Meat) Katsu Burger and I have to say this is the best in town!   Though I want to come and have one every week but I don't really want to be a Fat Ninja anytime so I would usually share that with a friend. That Katsu is MEGA size but still so juicy and tender. Biting in one give me this vision I am one of those Japanese food mangs's characters (Food Wars:  Shokugeki no Soma) going WILD.    Love their soft serve: Matcha and Ube. And of course their taro chips!  Parking always an issue but I usually just walk over from Pacific Mall's parking. (A short walk is good for me!)  Menu though is simple but I like how Fat Ninja Bite works on making what they serves perfect.  Maybe I should try something else next time? But why I ended up always ordering the katsu?!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in the area. I usually ordee the chicken or pork katsu and its yunmy. I love their soft serve ice crean with rice crispies and pocky! The taro chips are yummy too."}
{"text":"Biggest katsu i have ever eaten!!  This hidden gem comes with big surprises. The katsu burger is juicy, with the slaw and sauce makes a perfect lunch meal."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I had all year, and I ate a LOT in 2016. We had the chicken Katsu burger with white meat. It was unbelievably juicy and tender; the panko was very crispy but didn't cut my mouth. The burger had lots of cabbage and lettuce and pickle, and I had spicy mayo which I definitely recommend. The taro chips were as good as everyone said, and we scarfed them while we waited. Seafood pancake was delicious, perfectly cooked and packed with seafood, also served with a damned tasty sauce. I ended the meal with a twisty ice cream, which, again was fantastic and just the right size.   Another reviewer mentioned how great the service was and I have to agree. They are clearly invested in their customers and provide service better than many more expensive places in Toronto. It's a terrific place with essentially flawless food and I hope they stay in business forever."}
{"text":"We tried the chicken katsu white meat burger. It was good but I wish there was a little but more seasoning. The place is better for takeout as the sitting is limited but the service is good. Friendly hardworking staff . Menu choices are limited but good."}
{"text":"Previously it was this halal burger joint. Place didn't change much except of course the menu. I had the Don Katsu and it was tasty. The portion was a lot though but for a good price. It tasted much better with mayo for the chicken!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon and was greeted by friendly staff. We ordered two cheese donkatsu burgers (about $10 and a side of taro chips. Taro chips come in a bag but are crispy and delicious. The burgers are big and were A+++!  Also came with a side of coslaw made from japanese mayo (I think) nice and sweet creamy taste, a nice compliment to the burger. Doesn't take long to get your order. Limited seating in the restaurant, about maybe 8 seats. You can also order through Skip the Dishes. Awesome experience, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I had the katsu burger. Dark meat. Oh my. I was blown away. I was so disappointed when it was over.   My only issue is with the seating. Not many places to sit so be prepared to have your meal to go.   They were real quick too. I believe I waited only about 4-5 minutes for my order. I went on a not so busy Saturday afternoon though."}
{"text":"If I can give a 10 stars to this Resturant I would .. you do need a little bit of wait time .. but soooooooooo worth it ! I sent pics to all my family and friends ! Must come place in Scarborough !"}
{"text":"I ordered through Skip the Dishes. It was worth it. The Chicken Katsu Burger is yummy. At first, I was not sure if Katsu Don would be a good taste on a burger but it was a nice combination with the coleslaw. We'll definitely try again and order other food from the menu."}
{"text":"The workers are incredibly nice and informative about their menu. They made us feel very welcomed and offered fresh taro chips for us to try. I had the Katsu wet noodle and it was delicious and the portions were big. Definitely would come again to try out their other options."}
{"text":"Amazing food and customer service is even better. Friendly environment. Great food! Got the chicken sandwich, I could not finish it."}
{"text":"Fair price, large portion, very yummy, good server, very friendly staff. The only downside is the small parking lot. We parked in the Club Kennedy plaza and walked over."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly! I ordered the don katsu on rice, a classic Korean pancake and the swirl soft serve while i waited. (clearly was starving, no i couldn't finish it! Amazingly big portions) The wait seemed longer for the Korean pancake, but it was freshly made so completely understandable.  Don Katsu on rice was good, I liked how they used a meat thermometer to check before serving! Big portion of meat, just overall a very generous portion.  Korean pancake was also huge, but my the time i brought it home it was quite soggy. (My fault) BUT they do cut the box in the corners to allow the steam to escape which was thoughtful!  Soft serve was okay... perhaps I should have tried the individual flavours first before combining them. Wasn't a lot of matcha flavour or ube. Just tasted sweet!  Parking was kind of troublesome because the lot was quite narrow with only a few parking spaces.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and the food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places now! Came here the other day to get lunch with one of my friends and we both fell in love.   I got the chicken katsu (white meat) and wow it was amazing! The burger itself was huge and they gave a side of coleslaw with it. It was around $12 which was a good deal.  The staff were super friendly and always had a smile on them. Parking is super tight in this plaza, so you might be waiting a bit outside if you want to dine in. Also, there is limited seating inside. The restaurant itself is really clean inside. However, the washroom is small.   I will definitely be back and I will recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is probably the best Katsu place in all of the non-downtown Toronto area. The only place that compares well is Kaiju in downtown but that's a different crowd altogether.   This is a small space in general with probably 10 seats along the side. There's a simple counter with a concise menu (basically katsu burger, noodle, rice or bulgogi). The girl at the counter was super smiley and friendly. I decided to get the Chicken Katsu burger.   It took approximately 10 minutes to get my food which was a little long but what came out was a beautiful creation. The burger had a huge piece of katsu that was two times the size of the bun. I was initially worried that it would be too small and not filling - but I was proven wrong! There was also a small coleslaw on the side.   The katsu was well fried, lightly battered and perfectly crispy. The taste was flavourful with the katsu sauce as well as a Big Mac like sauce on the lettuce on the burger. The flavouring and dressing was almost like a Big Mac but with a wonderful piece of Katsu. This was a 5/5!  I also decided to finish my meal with a black sesame and matcha soft serve ice cream. This was not the best because it's not as creamy as I wished that it would be. It was kind of icy. However, it was an acceptable dessert.   All in all, I would come back for the katsu! This was a wonderful place for a quick simple meal. Just try to avoid coming at a busy time. I came at 2PM on a weekday and it was already pretty filled."}
{"text":"If you love katsu of any kind then you have to come to fat ninja bite.  They have the softest and tastiest katsu I have ever eaten in my entire life.  They also have the one hung I love most which is matcha! So yummy too.  You can have the katsu with rice. Noodle or make it into a burger.  How awesome is that?  The burger is quite big and you get a side of taro chips to go with it.   I was sad I wasn't able to try the Korean pancake cus they sold out but it's just another reason to check out the place.  A hidden gem in Scarborough and a must go!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars: good food, good price, good portion, and uber friendly staff.   We chicken Katsu burger, chicken Katsu stir fried udon, and original korean pancakes.  1) The katsu burger tasted as amazing as it looked. The katsu was perfectly crispy, very good flavour; paired nicely with the burger and coleslaw salad. I was told that they made their own breading mixture from fresh bread.   2) Stir fried udon was so good. Udon and veggies were al dente and well sauced. It goes nicely with the katsu on the side.   3) original korean pancakes: this is the only meatless option here.  It was yummy; comes with home made soy sauce.   Staff were super friendly and helpful. This is a self serve type of place. You order and grab a seat; and they call you when your order is ready. One downsize is parking lot is super tight and it's quite busy on weekend."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon a newly opened Korean joint across from Pacific Mall. Some items they offer are a  don katsu sandwich, korean pancakes and katsu noodles.  The Korean diner is called @fatninjabite they are still in the early stages of opening, which means more trial runs for a tastier menu (cant wait to see what else they come up with). So far from everything we've tried they are on the right path to something delicious.  Tried out the Bulgogi Burger. After the first bite you can tell it was marinated well, as it was juicy and had a sweet savoury taste to it. It came with a side of delicious crispy taro chips (guaranteed you just cant have 1 chip). If you have a chance to drop by, i would recommend that you get the Bulgogi burger or katsu sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great katsu burger!! Finally had the chance to visit this little place today, and it was completely empty around 4 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon. (The weather's been getting colder lately too so I don't blame anyone for staying home.) We were cheerfully greeted when we came in and my friend and I can't eat too much, so we decided to split a white meat chicken katsu burger. I asked my friend if they wanted extra sauce on the side when we were ordering and the man taking our order said that he would put some in for us, without any extra charge which was really nice.  The burger itself, as you can tell from the many pictures, is more than enough for one person. For two, it was definitely a good meal that didn't leave me so stuffed that I couldn't have dessert, but left me feeling good and with a little room to spare. We got two cutlets in our burger, with coleslaw and extra sauce on the side. The burger is very good, the cutlet very crispy and the orange sauce inside tasted like Big Mac sauce (?? Not that I'm complaining). However, although the chicken was a good texture on the outside (crust), as I bit into it, it felt somewhat rubbery. It was kind of unnerving to have the whole cutlet be like this, maybe it had been cooked too fast or was kept in the freezer too long, but it had just developed a strange texture. Easily overlooked if you focus on the rest of the burger as a whole and this was most likely a one-off sort of thing.  Service was great; this is more of a take-out place but we were thanked when we left and the workers were plenty cheery. The burger was a little on the pricier side, but if you do get a katsu burger and dessert and split both, you would feel quite satisfied without having to whip out a twenty for your meal."}
{"text":"I don't know why I love fried foods so much but Fat Ninja Bite makes one mean katsu! I was really craving a burger and decided on the chicken katsu burger. For ~$10, you're getting one giant burger, stuffed with a piece of katsu so big it's spilling out, and a small cup of coleslaw. I'm sure from all the photos you can see how massive this burger really is. Though one can definitely finish one on their own, you just miiiight get a little sleepy after. It was freshly made and I loved the batter and texture of the burger, just writing this is making me hungry again. Tip for eating this huge burger? Cut off the sides of the katsu and eat that first, then move onto the burger itself. Grab a few napkins handy cause it's about to get messy. Once finished, go home and take a really nice nap.  Fat Ninja Bite is a small shop at the corner of a tiny plaza across from pmall, there's a very small and cramped parking lot if you're driving. Inside, there's a few stools there for you to sit and eat, super casual. From the value to flavor, it's definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"A new place that opened. Its Korean or Japanese. Very interesting menu but no pictures so it was difficult to order. The girl that works there is super friendly and helpful in helping us make our order. We ordered the bugoogi burger, katsu noodle soup, pork katsu with rice, taro chips and kim chee. The kim chee is home made and delish! the taro chips is also yum. The bugoogi burger interesting and I loved it. Noodle soup is also very good. Its nice is authentic. The prices are reasonable for the good quality of food. The staff is so nice always asking us if we liked it and and any questions. its new but Im sure when it gets super busy its not going to be 5+ star service but for now it is and the food is different new and exciting. Love it and will be back with my kids!"}
{"text":"Limited parking and limited seating but don't let this small plaza and small restaurant turn you away. First of all when you enter the restaurant, it is small and all seating is like bar stool along the window so if you want to dine in you might have some difficulty finding a seat. But why would you want to take this out? You want to eat it fresh! The staff was friendly and prompt in terms of getting the food out. Now to the food, I got the Don Katsu and Chicken (dark meat) Katsu Burger, both off them much larger than the burger itself (see picture) so it was very generous. Biting into it, the favour was just right and it was tasty yet it did not feel oily or heavy!  Between the two I would prefer the Chicken over the Pork. The chicken being dark meat had just the right amount of fat so it doesn't taste too dry compared to the pork.   Worth going back again."}
{"text":"I happened to see Fat Ninja Bite while driving by and decided to bring my girl there. The girl at the front is super friendly and even gave us a sample of fresh taro chips!  We both got the Don Katsu burgers and they made them fresh right then and there. The Katsu is much bigger then the bun and is nice and crunchy. Its even better than some I've had in Japan.   It does fall apart a bit near the end and I wasn't entirely full because the coleslaw they provide is quite tiny. But definitely check it out because it's good!"}
{"text":"great burger and seafood pancake. great service."}
{"text":"Just looking at pictures of their food, there was no doubt this place was going on the to try list. Unfortunately, came here twice but only ordered food once. There's less than ten seats, guess they were going for more of a take out style food joint. Personally am not a fan of ordering fried foods to go. The staff behind the counter were all very nice and helpful.  The menu is simple and it wasn't a tough choice choosing what to try. The main star seen in most pictures was the fried protein in a burger or with rice or udon. Got the fried chicken katsu burger, was not disappointed. The katsu was huge and there was so much of it sticking out from both sides. The burger in all honestly wasn't that special but the katsu was moist and fried really well. It was extremely filling and the tummy was quite pleased. The price of everything on the menu was decent, not bad at all.  Overall, there will be definitely be more future visits. Just hope there will be seats there. Would even go just to grab so ice cream, the green tea and purple yam were both surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Yep.  That's 5 stars up there.  If you hit the trifecta of food then you get an automatic 5.  Great Service, Good Value, and Great Taste.  I checked into this place twice in two days.  One day with JK-the Yelpernaut of the Year, and the second with a Yelppy (for those who don't know what this is - It's a Yelp Puppy).  I used the Yelppy as an excuse to go the second day.  Fat Ninja Bite is awesome.  During my three places in three hour tour with JK, this was my favourite stop.  The restaurant is in a tiny strip mall located on the east side of Kennedy, just south of Steeles.  For those travelling south, It is next to the Petro-Can station.  If you are travelling north and you see Petro-Can.  Yep...you missed it.  Now you have to do the horrible thing of trying to navigate back from all those Markham drivers you heard about, running in and out of PacMall.  Some of you may just not want to risk your life at this point, but turn around whichever way you can.  This place is totally worth it.  Parking is a premium during busy times so it might make sense to park at Pac Mall and walk over if you can.  The menu is simple.  You can have burgers, rice dishes, even noodles, and dessert/snacks.  If you have any of their Katsu, dessert and snacks will be off your list as you may not have room!  The Katsu is HUGE!  You can probably make multiple sandwiches from one serving.  I have been known to pack away quite a bit of food in one sitting but this was a challenge.  There are 3 Katsu.  Pork, dark meat chicken, and white meat chicken.  You can have it on a bun or with rice.  Either way is good.  The FUN is on the BUN, as the Katsu is three times bigger than the bun itself.  Fork and knife comes in handy or you can reconstruct the burger and try to get your mouth around it - you may need to do the \"Guy Haunch\".  For Beef eaters, they have Burgoli - haven't tried it yet but next on my list.  The staff here are perky, funny, friendly and fast.  Both times I've been there, they made my Katsu fresh - need to or the breading loses it's crispiness and the meat dries out.  You also know it's fresh because as the orders go by, an older gentlemen out back, is constantly beating the meat...er...tenderizing the proteins...er whatever!  :))  At around $10 for a Katsu burger that will easily tame a big appetite, it's a bargain for such great tasting food.  Pick up a pack of Taro chips too - soooo good.  Not an ice-cream guy but that also looked wicked awesome.  Now only if I can get a client in the east end of town, I can drop by more often.  FNB is part of my exclusive list of Fab-Fivers!  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing. Upon entering this small joint, my girlfriend and I were both greeted by the store owners. The menu is rather condensed which made it easier for us to choose our items. We ordered the Pork Donkatsu on Rice, and the portions was huge. The quality surpassed our expectations. The meat was succulent, juicy, and had a balanced aroma of Japanese authenticity. The sides were jasmine rice and a bit house-made coleslaw. My girlfriend and I shared this wonderful dish and we both were very satisfied. We will definitely be returning. Highly recommended for casual and/or quick eats."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best katsu in town?   One of my favourite places I've been too lately! It's a small Japanese fast food joint close to Pacific Mall that specializes in katsu. Yes, parking there is terrible especially definitely peak hours but it's worth checking out.   You can get a variety of protein either on a burger, with rice or noodles. After seeing those amazing burgers on Instagram, I was dying to try it. We got the katsu don and bulgogi burger along with a side of takoyaki. They fry when you order but we only had to wait a few minutes before getting our mains.   The katsu don was enormous and so, so delicious! They fried it perfectly so it was crispy on the outside while the meat was really tender inside. I had to slowly hack away at this before finishing. I would recommend sharing unless you have a really large appetite. Would definitely go back again to try their chicken katsu. The takoyaki was also wonderful, really fresh and pillow soft.   Although we were pretty full by this point we also ended up trying their Ube parfait which consisted of purple yam ice cream topped with toasted marshmallows, two Pocky sticks, a cookie and rice krispies at the bottom. I definitely enjoyed the crunchy additions to the ice cream which made it even better than I expected.   If you are in the area I would recommend coming by. You get an enormous amount of food for what you're paying and the staff is so friendly here. Also got a huge kick out of seeing that adorable crochet Fat Ninja."}
{"text":"It's my first time to have the katsu burger and it taste soooooo good! I love the taro chips! And am coming back for the purple ice cream."}
{"text":"Katsu is very yummy and portion is huge! You can literally split this and eat two full meals with one order. I tried the burger and rice and both were delicious. The chicken is more tender and juicy (if you're ordering the dark meat) but the pork is more traditional. You can also order the katsu with different sauces, such as garlic, chipotle or spicy. I would recommend getting it on the side though instead of having it on the katsu. The staff seems very friendly as well. Everything about this place is great except for the parking and seating. I guess it's more for takeout since it's so small, but the parking lot is horrendous to get into and it's too tiny to comfortably find parking spots. I wouldn't come here during busy hours like peak lunch and dinner times but other than that, would definitely keep coming here!"}
{"text":"As per everyone else's suggestions, I tried the chicken katsu burger and taro chips. I also opted to phone in my order ahead of time in case it was too busy. I was there just before 6pm on a Sunday and it was dead! Picked up my order real quick. Drove all the way home before eating it as I had my little one with me and didn't want to stop. Surprisingly the chicken was still quite crispy when I got to eating it! The sauce had a chance to soak into the chicken which I thought made it delicious. Opted for the dark meat as I like my chicken juicy.definitely a large portion. It Almost looked like they threw in a second piece of chicken into the take out container!  The coleslaw salad was meh. I've had better coleslaw.. I snacked on taro chips during the car ride and they were seasoned with salt and something like roasted seaweed flakes. They weren't bad but I don't think I would get them again unless I was really hungry."}
{"text":"Only came here for the soft serve of green tea and ube. I thought it was ok for 3 dollars, where they put the rice crispies and pocky sticks for the whole sundae experience. Found the ice cream not too creamy though and more icy. Would like to try their famous burger though next time. Very limited seating."}
{"text":"This is the first I have heard and eaten a katsu burger and this place did not disappoint! I saw this place from a friend's instagram account and knew I needed to try it. We ordered the Chicken Katsu burger and finished off with the parfait. Mmmmmmm.... So yummy!!!! The burger looks intimidating because of its large portion size but the batter is so light and so is the bread... Which made for a very awesome meal! Its just packed with crunch and flavor that you will def leave satisfied. The price was fair for a gourmet burger... Not a wallet buster at all as its pretty filling. The only things preventing me from giving it a 5 is the parking... Its a very popular place with extremely tight and limited parking and the resto itself is small so you kind of feel pressured to eat quickly so others can sit. Its not a sandwich u want to take home anyway since it will lose its crunch and yummmmminess. Anyway enjoy!"}
