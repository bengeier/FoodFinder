{"text":"We visited Heavenly Espresso today for the first time and fell in love! We had breakfast and coffee with our two young children (2 and 2 weeks old). The owners were soo kind and welcoming, we felt like we were at home. Dining out with two small children can be challenging but we felt comforted knowing that they were so kid friendly. 

The breakfast was delicious and fresh and the coffee was great!!! 

We will definitely be coming back here! So happy we found this little gem!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful coffee place. The owners are welcoming and good-hearted. The flavored coffee changes daily, so check out the flavor. The food is reasonable and made from scratch. I had taken my daughter for a tea-party. So cute! She received hot chocolate, healthy snacks, and a little gift. We like to sit out on the little patio. It is peaceful, and it was built by the owners. The hours are 7-3pm, Monday- Friday."}
{"text":"YES. Coffee made to order with enthusiasm. Blended latte straight up was great. Place had a unique and local feel. My breakfast burrito was awesome as well. Icing on the cake was a great attitude from the staff the whole time. Thanks!!"}
