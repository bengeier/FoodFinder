{"text":"So-so barbecue.  Slow, sloppy service.  Rude \"manager\".  Don't bother."}
{"text":"I like BBQ, so I enjoyed Hoggy's. If you don't like BBQ, you won't."}
{"text":"Hoggy's comes on like a fairly uninspired chain restaurant. So it was very surprising to find their food solidly above-average.   A half-rack of baby back ribs was appropriately tender and well-sauced, if a bit on the fatty side. (The server did not ask for my preference of sauce, so I assume what I got was the house sauce.) But it was the sides that stole the show: Onion rings were incredibly crispy, with a light-colored, slightly spongy batter that brought a funnel cake to mind. And the mac and cheese was thick and creamy (though technically it included pasta other than macaroni) and very flavorful.  My wife wasn't as impressed; she ordered the trio of pulled-meat sliders, and found them dry and overly bread-y. (The rolls aren't the usual White Castle-sized buns, but rather miniature torpedo buns.)  But she agreed that the onion rings were pretty outstanding -- even though hers seemed a bit greasier than mine.  The price was perhaps a smidge on the high side for the food, but we had leftovers and full bellies by the time we left, so I can't complain too loudly. It's definitely a place I'd consider returning to after a movie at the Cinemark next door."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experience I have had in an extremely long time, if not ever.  After going as part of a group of four, and ordering 3 beers, the server came back over five minutes later to tell us they were out of two of our choices.  The server had close to ten tables, as they were understaffed it would seem.  After waiting for forty minutes for food, we asked if we could move to the table literally next to the one we were at, as there was a draft from the a/c that was blowing on is, and we were told they couldn't turn it down.  As we moved, the server realised how long we were waiting, and went to check on our food, and brought it out.  It was cold, and we asked the manager if we could get it heated up.  This is where I really lost it:  the manager had the audacity to tell us that it was our fault because they couldn't find us since we moved tables(next one over).  Also, we got the food minutes after moving, making it seem like she was making excuses.  We weren't mad before she stopped by, as restaurants get busy, but the managers job should be to smooth over situations, not say it's the guests fault.  None of us will ever go back, I don't recommend you go either."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon, wanting to grab some grub before seeing a movie.   There were 4 of us and we decided to feast off of appetizers! It was happy hour around 2 in the afternoon and most appetizers were half price ( exception would be the platters with multiple items on them)..   The places smelled like BBQ and looked like a barn on the outside, and felt like a barn on the inside. They have a 'bar' area when you first walk in, and a mixture of tables and booths. Not too bad!   We ordered... well, we ordered lots of food... Mini Burgers, Honey Garlic Wings, Spicy Terriyaki wings, chicken fingers, BBQ Nachos and Freckles. The most obvious item needing explanation is the.. Freckles.. first i will say YUMMY!!!!! They are sliced pickles - fried... almost like tempura pickles.. flaky and light... the sauce reminds me of a thousand island dressing but a more 'picklely' taste ( if that's even a word)... we all liked that.   Not a huge selection of beers, but the waitress was a little unsure it seems... but no big deal, we were there to really eat!   The wings were a little big plain, we agreed a little bit more spice and flavor would have made us proud....   3 out of 4 LOVED the BBQ Chicken Nachos.. loaded up with shredded pieces of chicken it was a favorite.... I personally am not a fan of nachos so I couldn't vote to LOVE them.   Service was attentive and friendly, but sometimes a little slower... we paid with cash and fast in order to get out timely.   Other than that, it had some super high lights, and some OK points... nothing to suggest NOT to go there... I would love to try the meals sometime in the future....."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch with coworkers today at Hoggy's Figured we'd try something new instead of the same old Independence-locale fare.   I was game and in fact have been craving some kind of barbecue for a while now.   The atmosphere is hokey, barnyard, elderly, and barbecue. Can't say much more about it.   We arrived sat and ordered fairly quickly which is always a plus for us on lunch. I chose the beef brisket sandwich, side salad, and coleslaw. Salad came out first with my bleu cheese dressing, which I immediately frowned at because it wasn't chunky bleu cheese. Yes, I'm a bit picky about my bleu. But as usual my expectations are never high for these types of spots. The brisket came out tender and juicy and somewhat flavorful. Although my plate was empty as the coleslaw didn't make it. I was brought a larger side portion.   Overall, wasn't all that impressed ... in fact I'm typing this so lazily right now because I almost don't even care to make a review.   Don't let my review stop you from trying Hoggy's as I believe it delivers what it promises. It's just that I'm not a fan of that promise."}
{"text":"We went to Hoggy's last night as a group of 10 and were seated at a table in the bar. Service started pretty well with the drink order, but for the rest of the evening, she really did not seem on top of it. She didn't actually seem to have a good understanding of how to wait on people, so I'm going to guess she was new to the whole service thing. Water and iced tea glasses ought to be automatically filled...don't bother the diners by asking them if they want more, just do it! We waited a long time for our food, and one of our members waited 5 minutes for silverware after the food actually arrived, so real spaciness where service is concerned. As I've often said, and will repeat here, that's usually OK with me, as long as the barbecue is worth it. Sadly, I cannot endorse the barbecue at this establishment.  Hoggy's website claims that they smoke their meats over applewood, but there is neither a trace of smoke flavor nor that tell tale line of pink in either the St. Louis or baby back ribs.  The menu gives you the option of ordering your ribs wet or dry, which is usually a good sign that they know what they're doing, so I ordered mine dry, and got overly charred ribs that had been aggressively spiced with their dry rub. I was sick of the taste of the dry rub before I finished my half rack, simply because there was no other flavor to speak of...no smoke, and an obviously inferior cut of meat that offered up none of that good porky flavor that is present in the best ribs. The ribs were also tough, so I will say with confidence that there is no low and slow going on at this place, which means they're not real barbecue. We've started referring to this as Midwest Barbecue, which involves ribs, rub, and a grill. If they're actually smoking them, they need a lesson from a better pittmaster. Incidentally, no one else at the table was offered a choice as to how they wanted their ribs (I noticed the choice on the menu, so specified when I ordered), and some arrived sauced, and some arrived dry, as if the waitress just kind of made it up as she went along. My husband got a rib/chicken wing combo, and said the wings were good, but when I asked him if they tasted smoked, he said no... The menu claims they're smoked then fried. On the upside, the baked beans were good and the onion rings got thumbs up from all who ordered at our table. They do offer sweet potato fries, but they come with an unnecessary topping of  powdered sugar, so order them without if you prefer. I think sweet potato is sweet enough without the added sugar, so I do not understand this practice. At any rate, we'll be moving on to better restaurants next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hoggy's, I used to love you. When you had a location at Crocker Park, I found your employees attentive and happy to serve, your food fresh and hot and your atmosphere fantastic.  And then, you closed and I had to take my love for barbecue to Valley View, where the employees somewhat care a little bit, if they feel like it. I used to have my beers filled just as I hit the bottom of the glass. Now, it's as though Bill W. himself will serve the beer to me at the bottom of twelve steps before I get a second one.   It's the small fragments of bones that seem to find their way into my pulled pork and my pulled chicken that made me stray away from you. I can understand once, and chalk it up to being the one in a million that gets a sliver of sharp shoulder bone in my food. You had the good sense to remove my drinks from the bill and I think you for that. The second time, with pulled chicken and I was slightly annoyed. But, I kept my cool, and picked the offender out of my tongue, enjoying the rest of my meal with the slight tang of iron on my palate. You comped my meal, and I thanked you for your kindness.   And then, the third bone was the final straw. A sliver, I can understand. A two inch by three inch chunk of bone is unacceptable, and I told you that. You looked at me and turned away with a shrug, as if to say \"this happens all the time. We're Hoggy's, and you'll deal with it.\" I, in turn, stood up, and left as if to say, \"I've had all I cans stands, and I cants stands no more.\"  Yes, I will admit that Hoggy's is terrific when you're not worried about a bite taking out your molars. I do like their presentation, and the barbecue is wonderfully seasoned. Your two stars are for memorable meals, for wonderful conversations and times long remembered.  I only wish boneless were an option."}
{"text":"The barbecue here is pretty decent. It has a Texas roadhouse kind of feel to it and is a good lunch spot when in the area. The ribs I had were pretty moist and tasty. I'd probably revisit when in town again."}
{"text":"This place is seriously not the kind of restaurant that I would normally like.  It's chain-esque without actually being a national chain.  It's unhealthy and totally meat-centric, whereas I like salads with low-fat dressing and try to avoid red meat and pork.  I mean, it's called HOGGY'S for fuckssake.  The building looks like a barn.  Its appeal is to the kind of guy who has a heart attack at 47.  I would have expected to give it 2, 3 stars max.    That said, I was really happy with my lunch here today, regardless of the artery-clogging menu and macho vibe.  I had the Half Hog--a short (4\") pulled BBQ chicken sandwich with cornbread and a side of grilled asparagus (what? I like asparagus.) with almonds.  It was $5.99 and the perfect size for a light eater like myself.  You can get the same dish but with 2 of the short sandwiches for only $2-3 more, at least at lunchtime.  The barbecue sauce was yum, the asparagus was tasty, and the cornbread was ok.  My friend also really enjoyed his meal.  Service was alright, decor was more like a sports bar than a barn.  I probably wouldn't return on my own, but I definitely wouldn't argue if someone brought me back to Hoggy's."}
{"text":"Um....not so much.   Husband and I thought we'd try this place after saying 'we should try that place sometime' for about 6 months. I had high hopes. A place named 'Hoggy's' that isn't a chain sounds like a good bet to me. I like a meat coma as much as the next guy but this place was NOT GOOD.   Cool building with barn theme going on. Service was fine - seated immediately, place was warm with good music playing (Leadbelly and the like - good for a BBQ joint). Our order was taken quickly and the food came out promptly - things were looking good.  I ordered the 'Hoggy's Grazer' - a combo plate that includes ribs, pulled chicken, pulled pork, mac and cheese, baked beans, cole slaw, and chili.   Strike 1: Meat portions were decent size but the sides came in something very slightly larger than a condiment cup. Downer. Need me some sides that are more than a couple spoons-ful. But I get it, it's about the meat so let's move on.  Strike 2: The meat was just ok in the flavor dept. BUT..... it was lukewarm at best. Sorry. You need to serve HOT food at a restaurant. How hard is it to keep a vat o' pulled pork hot, really?  Strike 3. The 'mac and cheese' was totally pathetic. You cannot call that mac and cheese. Now, I'm from Wisconsin and it  may be said that I'm something of a mac and cheese expert (or at least a mac and cheese snob). And THAT was not mac and cheese. Mushy, overcooked noodles with some creamy cheese stuff on them topped with shredded cheese that was not melted AT ALL. Again, I know that it's a side and not the main event but seriously?  Overall: A real disappointment as it could have been so much more. Skip this one, folks."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Always busy. Festive decorations (all pseudo-Western and stuff). Tasty meats. INCREDIBLE ONION RINGS. I would go back just for the onion rings. Like, three orders of them."}
{"text":"I have to give it three stars for the bar area and bartenders. we sat in there for 1 1/2 hours waiting for the restaurant to open. Great time! They make the place worth the wait and so-so barbecue. The menu is a little too limited for me but Hoggy's is in a great location in Crocker Park. (this shopping area in Westlake is actually quite nice - and a step up for the west side).  If you are looking for a quick meal and some good people watching, go to Hoggy's. If you are looking for classic barbeque, don't bother looking here."}
{"text":"On Canal Road, there are two restaurants located adjacent to each other that will forever prevent me from becoming a vegetarian as long as they are open. Hoggy's is one of them.  Everything about this place is perfect--the portions are large, the prices aren't too bad, and most importantly, the food is great. I have never had anything here that was anything less than extraordinary. The food is well-seasoned, but not overly so to the point where it becomes overpowering. I highly suggest ordering the Chili Mac for a side dish.  More importantly, the staff is very hospitable and friendly. On my birthday, we had to wait a VERY long time (we had a large group, and it was a Saturday night). The restaurant threw in two free appetizers as a result, and they didn't nickel-and-dime us either (i.e. you can't pick this or that). I was really impressed!  If you like to eat and you appreciate a nice piece of slow-roasted meat, go to Hoggy's. Seriously, I have never, ever had a bad meal at this place, nor has anyone with whom I have eaten at Hoggy's said anything bad about it."}
