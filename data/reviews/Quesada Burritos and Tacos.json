{"text":"The food was very fresh and tasty (and healthy), the place was spotlessly clean, and the staff made us feel welcomed from the moment we walked in the doors. Plus they have a frequent burrito card, and the prices are not bad. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been to other Quesada locations and am always impressed by their service and food. This location, however, doesn't meet the same standards. They are not as generous with toppings, the nachos had very little cheese and the \"large\" burrito was equivalent to the small one at the other locations. Still tasted good though."}
{"text":"This is the only place I can really go to near my workplace that can give me a \"my tongue might fall off\" hot sauce experience (sorry subway, your jalape√±os just can't do it). The staff are very pleasant and friendly! The food is also great, I love that they carry Naked smoothies, the price is okay and the food portions are good too, some other places I won't name usually stiff you on cheese, these guys surely don't!"}
{"text":"The vegetables and sauces were very tasty. I had hoped this would be a similar experience to Mucho Burrito which I enjoy.   Unfortunately, they use dark and light chicken breast, including gristle/fat/bone pieces in portions of it.  This detracted from the overall flavour of the burrito and ultimately I ended up removing it.  Staff were polite and efficient, tables slightly dirty and unkempt. No dessert options (churros)."}
{"text":"It is cleaner than most chain places and the staff was very courteous. Prices are average for the food you get which it is better than mucho imo. I had the ancho pork burrito its spicy enough not too hot very  yummy. Expect a lineup of 10 minutes for lunch crowds well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot for lunch a few times and find it to be very hit and miss. Veggies are not always the freshest and they can be very skimpy with the quantity of food they give you. I usually get the large burrito bowl and wonder why I paid over $15 dollars for such measly meal. Although this may depend on the person making your meal as I have had 1 time everything was pretty good. Staff and cleanliness of the place is good enough just not consistent enough or enough value to garner more than the occasional \"I'll pop in to see if it's any better.\" Overall I think there are better spots for lunch and wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Because I was too lazy to drive up to a chipotle I made the unwise choice of choosing Quesada which was by the hotel I was staying at. In a nutshell you get less amount of food here when you compare to chipotle and the quality is lower to make matters worse.  Maybe it was because it was a slow day but the meats were dry and roasted veggies also looked more like dehydrated veggies. I guess being mixed with other ingredients will hydrate things a bit but even aesthetically the food didn't look tasty behind the counter. But I was hungry and lazy and needed food right away.  When they add toppings to your order they also make sure that you only get the exact specified amount based on the shape of their pouring spoon. I mean really? Is the cost of ingredients so high that you cannot just pour enough? Again this negatively compares to chipotle where they will pour plenty of food unless asked otherwise.  I don't own a business so maybe I'm just biased towards customers point of view but really it's just disappointing to know that I would have gotten a better meal for less money at another place."}
{"text":"Fair enough food and price, but literally the SLOWEST SERVICE EVER. Only ever one person on at night :(  It's unfortunate it's so slow because I would come way more."}
{"text":"For dinner I decided to get a burrito bowl. Was craving for one all day. Today I thought to give this place a try. I usually buy my burrito bowls from Chipotle.   But today I was glad to try this spot. And can I say this burrito bowl was amazing!!! I got large spicy chicken burrito bowl. With guacamole and there secret sauce.   The price for the bowl was decent I was able to get two large burrito bowls do 20$. But I wouldn't suggest getting the large cause it's a lot of food. I personally wasn't able to finish.  Overall, the food was amazing! Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Never tried mexican before but heard that was good so just wanted to give it a try. So we went to the nearby Quesada, this location. Its closing time was 9:30pm, we reached there at 8:45pm but girls there were to rude to welcome and told only take out and no dine-in. We asked her for suggestions but she was no help at all and made faces. Nothing was tasty at all, total waste of time and money, not going there."}
{"text":"Great service, great people, great and fresh food!!! Then the deals!!! Mind blowingly great!!! What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Recently opened, so I decided to stop by and give it a try. Prices are reasonable, portions are okay. Wasn't the best tasting burrito and wasn't the worst. For take-out Mexican i suggest sticking with Burrito boyz."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 star.   Was in the area and stumbled on this plaza that had so many choices most that I've never heard of.   I ordered a regular spicy pork for $6 and change. Taste was ok but the size was a little on the small side. It was during peak rush so most ingredients were fresh. Had the typical selection but was extra for guac. Also I got the hottest salsa but I felt there was almost no heat in my burrito. On a plus side they offered brown rice and whole wheat tortilla. Had chips and salsa and I really enjoyed that. Chips tasted fresh and crispy. Can't say it will always be like that.   Service was good. No complaints.   Overall not bad and I was satisfied after my meal."}
{"text":"I made an order and when I received it the portion size was smaller than what I normally receive at other locations. My bowl in particular was very disappointing for $7. It was filled less than half way.  Will not order from this location again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and GOT DAMN! I loved it! It's a simpler burrito boys joint and it's quick and easy everything is laid out on the menu I usually get the chorizo large burrito nothing can beat that flavour"}
{"text":"This is probably the place I go to for burrito. Instead of Chipotle, I would choose this over as prices are definitely cheaper and more options to choose from. Yes, the staff can be skimpy on the veggies yet if you ask nicely for more, they will gladly put more until you say stop.   MAIN INGREDIENT TASTES - : a little dry, and only give you ONE thing filet - : my first choice... Well spiced and not chewy at all even though you can tell they are overcooked - : similar to the ones that you buy at supermarket... Those ready made ones that are always on sale  P.S... if you have their stamp cards, REDEEM ASAP!!! The staff told us that the chain will start using digital points card starting June 1 and all your stamps that you have collected will be null."}
{"text":"Service was decent, but rather confusing due to the servers asking what ingredients that we wanted on in different orders than the layout. The food, however, was barely edible. 2/5, I've been to worse places before."}
{"text":"Always good food. Very consistent quality. Good fast service. We always come here for lunch and the food and service are great. The restaurant is always clean.  Having worked in the food industry, cleanliness behind the counter is equally important, at Quesada behind the counter is always clean as well."}
