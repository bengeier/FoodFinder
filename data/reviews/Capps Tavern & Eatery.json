{"text":"Great burgers.  My wife and I love to go there on Thursday nights for the burger special.  Very friendly and good service.  One time we had bad service due to a very busy night and they comped us our whole check.  That was above and beyond, and impressed us so much that we continue to patronize them.  We have had good service on all other occasions, so that was clearly a one time event."}
{"text":"Food was great! The Calzone was perfectly cooked and covered with garlic butter. The fried pickles where pricy but delicious. They would have got five stars but the guy next to me ask if they had a military discount. Four stars for not supporting our troops. Shame"}
{"text":"Food has gone down hill for several years. Prices have gone up. The bar service is good but I wouldn't go for the food unless you stick with wings."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant here. Last night my boyfriend and I went out to eat here. He ordered pizza and I ordered wings, which were 10 wings for $10. I asked out waitress if the garlic cheesy bomb wings were spicy and she told us no, that the bomb meant that it was just extra cheesy and wasn't spicy. She also told us she has only worked there for about three weeks. So I ordered those wings. When the food came out, you could smell the wings and you could tell they smelt spicy. So I took a bite and it was beyond spicy. My boyfriend got the waitresses attention after about 10 mins of her no where to be found. I asked her if I could get a different flavor because I can't eat spicy food and I was told they weren't spicy. She was really shocked when I told her they were spicy and she said yes I didn't know they were spicy. About 5 mins later she comes back and says that she has to charge us for more wings because I didn't want those ones. I work in a restaurant, I know how it works. You don't charge them for more food when they were told the wrong answer. We asked to speak to a manager and he came over and was very rude to us. Acting like we just wanted free food and saying how in restaurants it doesn't work that way and if you order something and you don't like it, oh well. I started to get angry because it's not how it works. The customer always comes first. He told us just this one time he would not charge us for more wings and that if it were any other manager we would still be getting charged. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They are over priced and the managers are rude."}
{"text":"From the time we got there to when we left, we had a great experience.  Our server was amazing and was right there with drinks and napkins before we had to ask. The menu has a nice selection of food items and there are specials as well. Last night's special was a burger and fries for $5.99. I had a full rack of ribs for $20 and they were meaty and the sauce was great. My husband had shrimp. They were large and tasted very good. We substituted fries with poor man wings which are steak fries basted in sweet parmesian (our favorite) or other flavors.. They are wonderful! For dessert we had brownie bites with ice cream and whipped cream.  Perfect way to end a meal."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food, price, atmosphere and service every time.  Would highly recommend going here"}
{"text":"Garlic balls, fried green beans, and garlic bomb wings bring us back again and again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, calzones, wings and beer but everything else is just okay. Not bad food just frozen reheat stuff. Awesome staff and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We have had the occasion to dine at Capps twice over the past two weekends.  The food was very adequate for standard bar food.  On our first trip, my wife had the Teriyaki wings; they were well cooked and sauce was plentiful.   I had a chicken salad.  It came with a fried breaded chicken filet cut on a bed of what appeared to be Italian salad mix from a bag.  The waitress recommended spicy ranch dressing.  The salad was better than the above description sounds.  Unremarkable, but perfectly adequate.  The following weekend, we shared a pepperoni calzone.  It had plenty of meat and cheese.  The sauce was a little ketchupy for my taste, but again satisfactory for bar food.

What made our experience above average was the welcoming service we received on both occasions.  We went to the bar to watch the baseball playoffs.  When we arrived the game was not on any of the 10 or so TVs.  The hostess found a place for us to sit where she could change channels just for us. On both occasions, the waitresses remained attentive, checking in on us and refilling our drinks long after the dinner was finished as we watched the games.  This service made the evening special for us and was appreciated.

To sum up, good food, great and friendly service.

For some reason, which I cannot figure out, all of my reviews end up on Yelp's \"not recommended\" list.  Do not let that fact stop you from trying Capps."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Hands down my favorite pizza place! And there soups are all amazing!!!!! I think there was a week where I ate here 4 times because it is so good! 
Inside seating can be loud but still nice.  The manger/owner (I assume she is one of those because she is there a lot and always checking on everyone) is wonderful, and really cares about her customers!"}
{"text":"So I order and here is what I got a pizza that looks like it was dropped on the dam floor just sucks you look forward to pizza all week and bam this oh yea the pizza was ok. But the plus side is the loaded fries was good"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem...originated in 1917 and today is a great sports bar/restaurant. Multiple TVs indoor with a great outdoor patio wired with speakers and even a gentle water fountain. Several beers and wines, extensive menu (burgers and pasta was amazing) and friendly staff. Will visit again!!"}
{"text":"Food can be inconsistent depending on the specials. Seems to be best on Thursday's for lunch and Monday's for dinner"}
{"text":"This is really a hidden gem that's not known to too many out outside of the area. The pizza and calzones are top notch (and huge), and I haven't had a more traditional meal there that I did not enjoy. As a bonus, the service is stellar as well."}
{"text":"Nice little tavern situated right off a traffic circle. Thank God the staff is friendly and the food decent, as it's one of the very few places nearby to eat. 
     This is a nice regular spot, and a nice spot to be a regular. One of the big factors in my rankings is price point for quality of food/service... and Capp's is in a great spot. The prices are very reasonable, the food quality is good, and the service is extremely friendly.
     Having eaten here for over a week, I'm very thankful that the menu has a nice selection. I've enjoyed everything I've tried, but must say the calzones are not to be missed."}
{"text":"Capps is still a favorite of mine thanks to the amazing burger they made, but I've decided to revise my score for this place due to the service. I went here recently with my boyfriend for a late lunch. It wasn't busy for once so we were able to be seated right away. However, that's when the service started to turn sour. Our waitress wasted no time to  inform us that the coupons we were holding weren't valid and were only good for the other Capps location. This made no sense to me because nowhere on our coupons did it say it was only valid in the other locations. It listed the Leroy location's phone number, so we presumed that we could use them. We took her word for it and continued with our evening. I was going to order their \"handmade\" stromboli,  but when I requested to have no peppers in it I was rudely cut off by the waitress and told that I couldn't remove them. This tells me that the stromboli is probably frozen or premade if you can't even customize your order. I was rather annoyed and pissed off at this point and was about ready to walk out. The only reason I stayed was for the burger and garlic balls. In retrospect, I don't totally blame our waitress for being such a c-u-next Tuesday. She was probably just parroting whatever her boss told her to say in regards to the coupons and stromboli. I also work for a restaurant so I know what it's like to be tired and working all day. Hence, we still tipped her (albeit a lower amount than our usual). I'll come back for the food, but it won't be any time soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food ! We eat here very often and never have been disappointed. Only downside is that it is very crowded,a sign of a good restaurant. I have never seen a more diverse menu. Their burgers are awesome. I am going down the list to try them all."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've had in a long time. 

It appears that if you aren't a local, you don't get any service. 

Basic food took way longer then it should and getting a drink (or a second) only happened if you actively asked for one.

*Note- the bar tender greeted a toddler stumbling below the bar, before acknowledging actual adults sitting at her bar."}
