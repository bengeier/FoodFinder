{"text":"Never again. Twice i have ordered from here and twice my order has come back messed up. Items missing or incorrect both times. Items ordered without guacamole had it on there. My son had to be given benadryl from an allergic reaction. Missing drinks. Wrong food sent. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"My new fav spot for my Mexican food craving! I ordered the camarones a la diabla and it tasted fresh and delicious! The shrimp was large, plump and juicy. They allowed me to substitute chips for the tortillas, which I like to use to dip the refried beans. My boyfriend ordered a chicken enchilada plate and loved it. The staff is friendly, welcoming and do a superb job constantly cleaning the chairs, tables, soda machine and salsa bar."}
{"text":"They have the best el carbon tacos and Nachos. We can literaly knock out a dozen tacos just my family. Lol..  Always clean. The people are very nice. I've been coming here for a couple of years.. Every time I come to Vegas and want authentic Mexican food this is the number go to place. Prices have raised a little bit but still very reasonable. Must stop by here if your in town!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas a month ago and tried this place. I've been back 4 times now! Love the food...delicious...everything i've tried has been great and you get a good amount too. Oh...and they stay open late which is great for night owl's like myself."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! My husband and I got the breakfast burritos and they were so delicious! The tortillas is homemade and they make it to order so you know it's fresh."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place in Las Vegas. Being from San Diego, CA I absolutely love authentic Mexican food and this place is the closest to what I would get back home. Tons of options and the last time my girlfriend and I went in, we found out they have a vegan burrito for a super awesome price. We tried it out and got it enchilada style and oh my goodness it was the size of my arm and so flavorful. Their salsas are incredible as well. Housemade pico de gallo, super fresh verde sauce, a smoky spicy red and a habanero sauce that's sure to get you reaching for more. We will definitely be back! Thank you habaneros     EDIT: Found out they use animal lard in their beans, which means the vegan burrito is not vegan. Pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"Asked for shrimp nachos and they were delicious! Ive been looking for good tasting shrimp nachos since trying them in Catalina islands California .. And the service is awesome they are very friendly!"}
{"text":"OMG best carne asada ever!!!! The food was amazing, i came here expecting averege mexican food but ended up being the best mexican food ive had. I ate like a king here. The meat is amazing and has no fat. Just perfect. Highly recomend coming here."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to try this place because the reviews are either really good or really bad. But since Robertos up the streets been getting worse, it was time to try it! I ordered adobada fries. They were delicious and had everything on it. I asked for extra pico de gallo, which gave it that perfect crunch! The meat was good, the refried beans were not too salty, I loved it! I also ordered a lengua taco, which I didn't really know what to expect, I just wanted to try it. I didn't really like it, it was pretty dry, awe well lol. My boyfriends got #30, beef rolled tacos. There were a lot of them and the guac was very tasty! We will definitely come back here. No more robertos for us  Update next morning: my boyfriend had bad food poisoning and it seems like he has a sudden bad cold. I didn't have any of his rolled tacos. Maybe someone back there was sick or something but i would not recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"First time trying habaneros tacos. Had an order of three regular tacos. Asada, adobada and carnitas. The taste was good not something to wow about but still had a good taste. It did take a while for the employees to come to the front counter and help us, I actually had to waive to the surveillance cameras for them to see me. Besides that, my tacos seemed to be thrown together fairly quickly and without much thought. I actually had some pieces of different meat scattered around my plate. My true rating would be a 3.5 but without that being available, this quick eat is better than 3 rating hence my 4 rating. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I just had a delicious 7-Mares soup, it was great! The service is always great too, the manager Emiliano always greets you with a smile on his face."}
{"text":"Their food is excellent and their salsa bar is spot on. I love the Habanero salsa as well as the green salsa. The carnitas plate is extremely good. I would highly recommend over any of the other local Mexican food places in the area."}
{"text":"I still can't believe this place!  My son and I went here at 11:30 pm - ALL signs clearly state they close at midnight.  When we walked in the lady mopping the floor gave us really dirty looks.  I was very cordial to her and asked if they were still open and if we could come in.  She didn't answer.  I said I'm sorry for walking on your floor... we ordered - no thanks, no comments, just a cold person who was clearly miserable!  We paid and waited for our food.   There was no place to sit as all the chairs were on top of the tables.  The salsa bar was all closed down as well.  The food was even all that good either!!!!  I will NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!  My thoughts are don't close down at 11:30 if you're opened til midnight OR change your hours!!!!!   DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The prices are even better. They're not stingy with their horchata like most places. I love this place and highly recommend it. There Nevada burrito was almost as big as my forearm."}
{"text":"Food taste similar to Robertos. Their carne asada meat is delicious and well seasoned. Their portions are large and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Where should I begin... If I could give them no stars I would. I would like to be upfront I was just picking up the order for a delivery. I walked in there was nobody on the inside so I walked straight to the counter...there was nobody there. After about 2 mins Richard tells me he will be right with me. When he does come up I let him know I'm there for a pickup. He tells me ok the hadn't started I'll need to wait 10 mins keep in mind it was phoned in and was supposed to be ready by 9:40 it was now 9:45. At 9:48 they marked the food ready to go but no food. At 9:55 after watching 3 people come and go and cars go through the drive through I walk up again and Richard says how can I help u. I was like um I'm with doordash im here for a delivery he said oh yeah it will be 10 mins we have people ahead of you... I just about lost it I messaged support where they informed me they would call and find out. Once off the phone Richard tells me they didn't seem to be concerned. I was infuriated by this because it was just rude. He then tells me he's not worried about it either it's his uncles place and it's not a big deal to him either. I waited for another 10mins before finally getting the food. I asked for the managers name he said his uncle owned it I said ok my I have his number he said he doesn't have one. So I decided to put it all on social media. And I will be filing a formal complaint with the BBB . One service alone I would never eat there I don't care how good the food was. Richard if that's what his name really was should no be allowed to assist people in my opinion because that's not how people should be treated. As a driver I am an extension of that business and I will not be taking any orders from them again."}
{"text":"If you have a thing for late-night Mexican eats, this is your place- the drive thru makes it even easier to get your midnight crispy taco craving fulfilled without having to hit up a crappy chain. There's a huge menu, and they have daily specials if you're short on scratch. Their portions are pretty large, too.  But I've come by a couple of times and never seem to get an itemized receipt. The \"daily special\" bacon breakfast burrito never seems to ring up the same price twice. And the staff, polite though they are, barely speak enough English to take an order. Stick to the nachos, burritos, or adobada fries for freshest food."}
{"text":"4th time coming here. Food is great, nice portions at very reasonable prices! I've been getting their shredded beef chimichanga lately, pretty good. I tried the chilaquiles they were good, came with rice and beans, and eggs were fried just how I like them! The green sauce I thought was a bit spicy, next time I will try the chilaquiles with the red sauce instead. Forgot to mention the breakfast burritos are MASSIVE! Chorizo is the best."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Mexican food. Habaneros has taken the usual taco joint and pumped it up a notch. The number 1 two taco plate is so fantastic. I tend to order it everytime even when I intend  to order a new dish. Their shredded chicken is juicy, fresh and incredibly spiced.   Just today I ordered the Carnitas plate. It came with this huge, thick and awesome flour tortilla. The Carnitas almost melted in my mouth and I think I ascended to my ancestors where I was welcomed with open arms. It was so perfect and no other place comes close to the quality. I definitely recommend it.   Feeling cheap? Dollar tacos on Tuesdays and Monday's. These aren't some Taco Bell bullshit tacos. These are real, juicy and perfectly fried tacos. They use this thick corn tortilla and add a bunch of grilled chicken or beef. My wife's even loves this place and she's the pickiest eater in the world.  Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is they have HOT chile. So many Mexican places have this tomatoe soup for chile and it sucks. Habaneros has habanero chile! It tastes amazing as well and being genuinely hot."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, steak Fajitas and was sent shrimp chicken and steak. I am allergic to shrimp so wasn't able to eat anything. Even going through the order it says steak, avocado and cheese no where does it say in the order shrimp. Very disappointed with the whole order. Wasn't able to eat anything. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Since I first moved to vegas about a year ago, I left behind a favorite mexican restaurant and thought I wouldn't find another, until I did. The staff is very friendly and the food takes some time to cook, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! I go every Wednesday for the Fish Tacos 3 for $5. They also have great Chicken tacos for $1 on Tuesdays!! I have never had a bad experience here and LOVE the employees!!! EVERYONE should eat here (^_^)"}
{"text":"This restaurant taste different then the typical \"taco shops\" everything here has an extra spice. The guacamole they have here is amazing I've never tried Guac like this anywhere else. The tacos are served well and you'll never get a bite without meat on it. One of the Best taco shops in Las Vegas period"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this place. I would have given it a 3 Star, but my belly started to ache and felt a bit queezy as of right now. Beware yelpers"}
{"text":"Ok honesty here, I ordered a number 25,breaded beef, refried beans, rice, slices of avocado, tomatoes and shredded lettuce. First it took 3 times to get order straight. Time wise very quick. Got home excited to try, first time going there. The avocado ripe and tasty, the tomatoes fresh, crisp an tasty, lettuce crisp. The Spanish rice a little salty, the refried beans well tasted like a salt lick, yuk. The tortillas about 1 inch of ends were hard like old. The beef a little dry, salty, and breading was major dry. I wasn't really happy with the over  all meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place by FAR. The food is fresh and authentic, the portions are huge, and the staff is extremely friendly. I've never had a bad experience here. Every item is delicious and full of flavor. You can tell that they really take pride in the food they serve. The chilaquiles are to die for and the salsa is bomb.com. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was authentic and super fast. I will definitely come back. If your with the spicy salsa try the habanero salsa. Bomb!!!"}
{"text":"This was our second time back. They have 1 dollar chicken tacos on Tuesday. So I decided to go with the special. They were good and a decent size. One thing I enjoyed compared to Robertos is when you bite into them there wasn't a flood of grease pouring out and the Chicken had flavor. For a 1 a piece they were awesome. Wifey had a carne asada sope she said that there carne asada has good flavor. Again service was great and the gentleman working the counter remembered us. Will be a go to spot for cheap mex grub."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos you must try and staff is very friendly and clean place. May be new ownership now."}
{"text":"Carne asada Fries! I love this place! The food is delicious! The employees are friendly. I usually do to go it's pretty small inside. They have so much in the menu it's hard to decide!"}
{"text":"The service was better than the food. The man at the counter was extremely friendly but the food was just ok. The service is better than the Habanero's on Ft Apache but the food was not as good."}
{"text":"Pleased with food I ordered, disappointed my combo didn't come with a drink. Ordered Churros but dissatisfied I Had thought my order would come with 2 churros because the picture on the drive thru window had 2 and for showing 1.99 Missed the  utensil but good amount of napkins! I Look foward eating here again!  ErickAnthony"}
{"text":"So disappointed! Normally I love Habaneros. The carne asada burrito is so good. So today I ordered a potato, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito. The \"potatoes\" are French fries  I knew I should have gone to Robertos."}
{"text":"For a hole in the wall taco spot, this hits it! A bazillion times better than Robertos! Is it gourmet dining? Of course not. But wow! The salsa are sooo good! Not watered down and full of spice and flavor. They even have pico de gallo at the salsa bar! Score!! Had adobado nachos and they were deelish. Tasted a tamale too and boom! Soo yummy! No more Robertos here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I wrote a review earlier and for whatever reason posted to their #1 Fort Apache location.  This is for the #2 location on Rainbow. Habanero's Grill is heads and shoulders above their competition, and you know who they are.  The Best Breakfast Burritos hands down. Their adobada fries are excellent!  The salsa bar is better than anyone else's, much more flavorful. The staff is great. Prices on par with Roberto's and Pepe's, but much, much better in my opinion. Most of the spendy  \"sit down\" Mexican restaurants in Vegas aren't this good."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place through UberEATS. Got the Rolled Tacos Supreme with Chicken inside and Adobada on top. Also ordered a side of Fries and a Horchata. EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS!! I will be ordering from here or visiting in person next time I'm in town! (Which is all the time)"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wings...and they were raw. They were actually raw, we could not believe it. Never have we gotten under cooked chicken from anywhere.  Save your money and go somewhere else please. They obviously don't care enough about their customers to actually thoroughly cook their food. 0/10."}
{"text":"First time there today.  Fast, friendly service and very good food.  Had chili relleno and cheese enchiladas, both good.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very horrible drive thru service. The food we ordered was extra fried and the fries in the California burrito were hard, and cold?! Really? And my churros were hard and stale. Never again! Just go to Roberto's or Fausto's please!"}
{"text":"When compared to one of their sister locations and ordering the same entree there was a clear difference. The location and itself is kind of awkward relatively small, but simple. I love the drive-through added feature that way if i wanted something quick I can order it and order it from my car. However there was a clear difference in the food which shouldn't be but it could be me. I won't quite in them, it could be me but I will give them another shot and see if it was just an off day."}
{"text":"So far has been best street tacos in town, not to mention they have Abodaba Fries which are amazing and a personal favorite. They are clean, fast, drive thru , fully stocked condiment bar, and great customer service. I especially love that I can call in my order and just pick it up. Defiantly will be back numerous times"}
{"text":"When that 2 am craving comes around what better way to safely satisfied yourself then ordering some delicious, greasy Mexican food via UberEATS.   I fully took advantage of this the other night and indulged in some delicious rolled tacos and carne asada nachos. The food arrived still hot and fresh and man the portion sizes were huge! It was easily enough for 3-4 people to share. The pricing was also so cheap too. It was around $20 for both items including the delivery fee.  I do love me some Roberto's and have to say this is a pretty close match, but even better with delivery as an option. I'll definitely be taking advantage of this place more often."}
{"text":"This is a tacky taco trashy place.  The burrito was terrible!"}
{"text":"The other night I ordered by phone, and got EVERYTHING WRONG! I asked for a shredded beef burrito with cheese inside and enchilada style, wrong, I asked for a sope with adobada on top, wrong, I asked for a plain churro, wrong.  The only thing I like about it, is that it has a drive-thru."}
{"text":"This place is clean and friendly. The food portion is a lot, recommend the burrito carne asada and carne asada nachos. Everything on the menu looks really good and affordable... will def come again...."}
{"text":"poor customer service. if they get your order correct the food is good. if they don't it your fault"}
{"text":"Don't buy enchiladas from here, the cheese will be cold and unmelted. One of the plastic knives they provided was tarnished in residue, having clearly cut through some sort of food. Definitely won't be buying from here again. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This spot has never failed me in having excellent fast Mexican food. I promise the food tastes and has better quality than Roberto's!! You will not be disappointed. Their fish tacos have been the best I've ever had so far!! The sauce that they use is like crack!"}
{"text":"Clean place, then again we just left the place so they're getting ready to close. All chairs were up so we weren't sure if it was even open. The food took forever to be ready! Customer service was decent, not that great.  Food is okay. The way it was packaged was good.  I asked for the salsa that was already packaged and they told me to get my own from the salsa bar. But the one in the salsa bar had stuff inside it and I dont like that, my pickiness kicked in. The cucumber looked dry and old. Same as the radish.  He could have just given me the packaged salsa from the fridge. It was going to take more than a second.  I rather make the drive to Pepe's tacos."}
{"text":"Best chilaquiles EVER!! This place is bomb. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Friendly staff. The salsa's are very good too."}
{"text":"This is a Roberts but multiplied by 10. Besy Habanero hot sauce in vegas. Friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Rude staff, not welcomed on arrival or as we left, overcooked tasteless food and overpriced.  Should have gone to Robertos is right Yvette. Hey cook learn how to cook french fries and maybe i wont complain about crunchy ass stale flavorless carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Had some taquitos and carne asada fries delivered by UberEATS. Arrived within 15 min and was SO delicious. Their fries/meat is seasoned to perfection. There is more flavor in them than other restaurants."}
{"text":"Guess y'all needed the $1.50 more than I did, thanks for intentionally ripping me off, the shitty tacos aren't worth going back! Good luck"}
{"text":"I've been there many times drunk and sober. It's still good. Combination plates burritos and tacos oh my!"}
{"text":"I love the employee and one of the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, NV. I love there rolled tacos plate. My husband like getting the Adobada Burrito and all four of there different tamales. Been going to this place sense they have open this store. I also like taco Monday night best beef tacos I have every had."}
{"text":"First visit was good then tried this a few more times and disappointed each time.  Food wasn't prepared properly, Cheese not melted so the stuck it in the microwave and melted the Styrofoam plate to my food and ruined my lettuce.  Overcharged me but already ran my card so I just said keep it.  Twice in a row I ordered to eat in and they boxed it to go. Super Combos come with drink but worker didn't think combo meals were super combo but he didn't know what a super combo is.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was great, big portions and service was fast and friendly. The carne asada nachos were so large shared them with 3 people. Menudo was large enough to share also. We got cheesecake and two churros I recommend the churros. We brought family that was visiting so we had several plates, enchiladas plate, torta plate and the burrito combo plate - everything was great"}
