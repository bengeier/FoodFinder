{"text":"It's very roomy inside with quaint Japanese decor. We tried the spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll and the scallop yum yum roll. The fish was fresh and had a \"clean\" taste to it.  We liked it , and the regular rolls were 40% off!  $11 for 3 good rolls was great, and they have quite a selection of special rolls that will try next time. I recommend it. :-)"}
{"text":"This place was great. We went in about an hour before closing, so there were only two other tables in the place. We asked about the habachi menu, and they informed us that all habachi meals are 40% off, and since we are vegetarian and only wanted vegetables, my girl and I payed about $8 a person for some quite delicious grilled veggies, miso soup, and brown rice. The manager came by to check on us, and walked away shaking his head. A few minutes later, he returned with two Vegetable Rolls, and all he said was \"This is on the house. You must eat more! Too skinny!\"   Add to that that the hot sake is Buy-one-get-one (order a small and get a large, or buy a large and get a second one ;) and we walked out full of tasty food and drink for a cool $20. DEFINITELY a well spent dinner."}
{"text":"They have the best hibachi table.  1/2 off on everything on that menu.  It has been our favorite place for years!"}
{"text":"No substitutions. No fried rice. The only good thing was the egg roll. I ordered general tso's chicken. It was good at first. Light coating, light crisp to it. But after a few bites I found there to be too much of a certain flavor. It almost made my stomach turn. The brown rice I had to get was flavorless and got ruined even more when I put soy sauce on it to try and add some flavor. The portion was pretty small compared to some better Chinese places I've been to around town (check out Thai House on S Maryland pkwy in Henderson!). Suffice it to say that I will definitely not be returning here. I'll go back to my preferred places. Either Thai House or Golden flower on Russell and pecos."}
{"text":"I Love this place. I think they have the best lemon chicken in all of Las Vegas. I don't eat sushi however my family does and they love it so I give it a five just because of the lemon chicken. My family likes it because it's half off of most of the sushi rolls not sure what time that is but it's in the afternoon I believe"}
{"text":"I don't know if I have really high standards but the food was not great at all. To tell you all I usually don't even leave a little grain of rice... I did not even finished any of the three rolls I ordered, and neither did my husband. The fish did not taste right and the flavor was flat. it gave me a stomach ache and even the ginger tasted funny, not to mention the wasabi was almost brown... yuck. I am sticking to RA Sushi and Kona grill from now on!"}
{"text":"Decent food, good prices. However the staff could use some work. They're just very rude they rush you when your trying to order and get agitated very easily, kind of makes you feel like you are an inconvenience to them. I would not really ever recommend this place to someone unless your on a budget and would like the hibachi experience."}
{"text":"Good food for takeout! Very inexpensive and the service is good. Very good menu. With lots of options. I recommend for a good food experience and good prices."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch and only had a specialty roll - it was very good.  I won't be back due to bad service (the waitress was more interested in chatting with a waiter behind a screen), dirty table and a carpet that needed a shampoo 2 years ago."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to try this place initially due to the way it looked on the outside.  I was pleasantly surprised though when I went in for hibachi steak and shrimp and the menu said 50% off entrees.  Half off 20.50?  The house Chardonnay was acceptable and the price per glass was $3.50.  The decor was very nice and our chef was funny and all in all I have to say it was a great time especially when the bill came.  I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"We love this delicious restaurant. It is nice, quiet, lovely, the food is beyond incredibly amazing and the service is great. Very tasty. Lots of options and selections to choose from."}
{"text":"Food from here is actually really good. Everytime I go here, I make sure to get some kind of sushi roll. Today I ordered the Kamikaze Roll and to be honest, there was a little too much sauce on mine. The  chow mein barely had any flavor so I wasn't a huge fan of it. The service was okay, before my mother could ask them a question, they quickly jumped from table to table. We barely had time to stop and ask for them for something. I understood though, because there were about 5 families to feed and it looked like 2 servers there, I believe. Will come back because I love their sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Half priced sushi, are you kidding?  We ordered so much food we had enough to take some home for another meal.  Between the 4 of us we ordered 5 sushi rolls.  We ordered a combination of crab and scallops and each one was outstanding.  I think the bill was around $20.  Fresh food and good service adds this to my list of places to go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"We've now ordered to go a few times from Tata Bistro and have always been pleasantly surprised - it is now our go-to chinese place because it is leagues above the competition! The portions on the chinese dishes are BIG - very easy to share or have for a couple meals. Some things we've tried that we hadn't had before, like the Dan Dan noodles  which are thick noodles (sort of like udon) with a spicy, delicious ground chicken sauce. We've also and the long beans with pork (a bit greasy but very the beans were SO tasty). Another recent adventurous order was the chow fun combination, which I have avoided at other chinese restaurants because it was never flavorful enough. This chow fun rocked! All the protein was high quality (great shrimp, beef and chicken) - nothing rubbery or tasteless like you find other places. Really delicious. Again, huge portions that became leftovers for a couple days. Also they have really good egg rolls."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it from the outside, but TaTa Bistro is quite a large restaurant, including teppanyaki tables, a full sushi bar, tons of booths, and an area for larger parties. It is simple in design, nothing too fancy or over the top. The menu, however, is interesting. It combines japanese, chinese, and american influences to appeal to a variety of tastes. The price is relatively cheap, and the atmosphere is relaxed. My only complaint is both times I have visited, the service is a bit slow. Nice, but slow. I enjoy the \"lunch box\" specials. And a piece of candy from the candy bowl on the way out!  Recommended drink: I have not tried any of their drinks yet. More appealing as a lunch destination.  Recommended company: Coworkers, or a casual Sunday lunch with a few friends."}
{"text":"Tried it again hoping they upped their game, the service is still the worst I have had!! Maybe they figure you get 50% off so they only give 50% worth of service"}
{"text":"I have been to Ta Ta Bistro many times over the last year or so. They have the best egg rolls in town. Everything I've ordered has been great. Atmosphere is casual and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki the best in town!!!! The dinner at half off is Outstanding!!!! Value,  I give it a thumbs up.  They will get more business from us."}
{"text":"Fresh food and great service. I've only sat at the sushi bar but they have a teppan yaki grill and restaurant part that serves Chinese food along with Japanese cuisine.  They have a few no rice rolls that I start off with like the Rock and Roll that are \"wrapped\" in layers of cucumber! So Ono!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with my hubby and have always gotten the sushi. I think the sushi tastes better/fresher than places like Sushimon. Only thing is there is no all-you-can-eat here. But, prices are fair and on the regular rolls you always get a 30% discount. Service is good and there is barely any wait time especially when it comes to seating."}
{"text":"If you are wanting to order for delivery or want to sit and eat somewhere quick this is NOT the place to go. I ordered for delivery and the lady on the phone told me they only deliver up to 5 miles distance so I went on my GPS and measured the distance which turned out to be 4.8 miles. I told the lady the distance and she said it was fine. My food was delivered by a man who was extremely rude. He said the distance was 7.9 miles and made a remark about it being too far. When I asked him which direction he took he mention he took the freeway. Funny thing is their restaurant is on stephanie and I also live on stephanie. When I asked why he didn't just drive down stephanie he said he didn't feel like waiting for all the lights... wow, what great customer service right? I eat at their restaurant quite often and the service is never great. Their food takes for ever and everyone there seems to have an attitude at all times. The only thing that keeps me coming back is their prices. Their food is just okay but after the delivery experience I doubt i'll be going back. Unless you have patience for attitude and complete laziness I don't recommend going here."}
{"text":"I love this place but it used be a lot cleaner! I hate the carpet it's so dirty and dated  and the chair cushions need to be replaced and the bathroom is always dirty! This place used to be a great spot! The food is still good but it needs a clean up and fresh look to be hopping again!"}
{"text":"It's good in general.  The teriyaki beef was a little bit too strong.  Sashimi was in big chunk. I wish they cut each into 2 pieces. But sashimi was very tasty."}
{"text":"If you desire plenty of options, affordable prices, and great service, Ta Ta Bistro is the restaurant for you.  The menu contains a vast selection of both Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Although this is an untraditional method, I found the options to be refreshing because I could change my order each visit depending on which cuisine I was craving. These options are also helpful for pickier eaters. Furthermore, Ta Ta's also has Teppanyaki, which provides entertainment for people of all ages. The prices are inexpensive. Every day, the prices for roles are half off, which is perfect for college students on a tight budget.  The customer service was also great. My friend accidentally spilled soy sauce on her white pants and they immediately offered her club soda to mediate the situation. Their attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond expectations left a lasting impression on me."}
{"text":"I like to visit on my lunch break, its a healthier option than fast food and its super fast service with Delish sushi!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to write this place a review.  I stopped by last time I was in LV and visiting family in Henderson.  I didn't know what to expect, but I was very happy when I left!  Loved all the sashimi dishes and rolls. Got to sample a lot because we were a big party.   I REALLY want to try their teppan -- it smelled really delicious, and this random customer walking by told me it was amazing. Might as well try it, it's a great deal!  Oh yea, I just added them on Facebook, they post their specials on there too!"}
{"text":"This place could have been a five if we skipped the Hibachi grill and sat at the sushi bar and just ordered sushi.  We went in here as a party of 8 to celebrate my husbands birthday. I originally made the reservation for 6pm and then changed it to 6:30. This did not appear to be a problem when I called but as soon as we sat down we were being rushed and told that there was another party coming in for the Hibachi grill. We ordered several sushi rolls to begin with and they pushed to get our entree order at the same time. They brought us our soup and salads immediately and by the time we had received our sushi they were already cooking our food and taking away our half eaten soup and salad. It really took away from the whole experience.  The sushi was phenomenal. The meat/seafood from the Hibachi grill was fresh and tasted good but the portion size on the vegetables was almost non-existent. I will admit that two of the couples spit an entree but for the other four of us you would have thought that we did also... in fact, I would say it looked like we each got less than half a portion.  I'm a veggie lover - obviously disappointing to me. They tried to give us the checks immediately after we finished eating but we wanted dessert. We all got banana splits that were mediocre but they did put a birthday candle in my husbands and we sang happy birthday - nice touch!  After all of the rushing there was never another party that came in. A party of 2 sat at the hibachi grill next to us and that was it. It was a Monday night and the restaurant was dead. Maybe this mystery \"other party\" just didn't show up but regardless, if you let me make the reservation for 6:30 you should allow us ample time to enjoy our meals.  I would definitely go back again but only for the sushi."}
{"text":"Greatttt food and pricing. 5 of us ate at the hibachi grill, plus 2 plates of sushi, and two desserts for under 100 bucks. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is my 'Cheers'. If I ever need to smile, I just show up at tata's bistro. Randy the owner is awesome and a very proud chef. Allright on to what you are looking for:  Sushi here is amazing. Large cuts of always fresh fish. You have to try the Wild Fire, it's amazing. Everything here is good though. They have a large selection of sake and other spirits.  I just realized that my profile pic for yelp was taken at tata's.  Look for it on the wall of photos on the way to the restrooms."}
{"text":"Let's just say food is great but afterwards I had thee worst bubbles guts! I had to pull over at the albertsons right across the street and go to the bathroom it's a great place to go great cook but I had the worst bubble guts ever"}
{"text":"This place is very unassuming. I was pleasantly surprised with the sashimi. Large pieces and great quality. I've tried so many local sushi places in this town and I always come back to TA TA . I haven't really ordered anything else because I know the sashimi is what I'm going for ."}
{"text":"I am extremely furious at this place right now. I am nine months pregnant with a one-year-old we come here a lot I've never had a problem before. Today for lunch after I order I am told that that's a lot of food then about five minutes after my food arrives they come over take my play box it up and give me my check and tell me to leave. My son was not loud or distractive he was eating his food and they kicked us out and expected a tip. I will not be coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Arrived at the end of the 10-15 minute window for a to-go order. Stood at the register for at least 10 minutes before someone even spoke to me. There was no one around to even ask for help! Finally, someone rang up my order, but I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for him to bag it up. I live about 2 minutes from this place, so as a forewarning it was not the travel time that made this bad. My roommate and I started to eat our sushi and it was terribly soggy, like it had been prepared 40 minutes ago and was sitting out. It was honestly inedible. We threw away the rest of our $60 sushi dinner. Now, I know sushi to-go isn't supposed to be the greatest. But the decency to help me when my food is already ready and fresh would be nice. We might not have had this problem, had that happened. Instead, I'm sitting here waiting for a call back from the manager and trying to figure out what to eat instead."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place! The staff is friendly, food is fresh, facility is clean, and the sushi is delicious! We enjoy ta ta's at least twice each week and when we take our friends, they are always impressed. We are hooked! Great job ta ta's!!!"}
{"text":"A great experience!  I got the tempura udon and I loved it.  The soup and noodles were the perfect texture.  The tempura was excellent.  I got seated right away. Decent prices on the menu. I know I will return. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Visited again - Bad again...  I don't know what to think...  Regular staff I tipped well (around 25%) treated me bad again.  Food isn't good enough to tolerate the service.  Sad, they're done in my book."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! Every step of service is missed and the food is horrible. The nigiri was fishy smelling and the piece that was eaten had a fishy taste. It was also room temperature!  The fried rice is cooked with brown rice which was not communicated on the menu. It was mushy and over cooked. Do not waste your time or money. There are way too many other options! STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Very strong three star. Food was just a 3.5. Price was 5 star. Half price on this Tuesday night. Friendliness of staff was 5 star. Would come back if I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Henderson. The sushi chefs are always friendly and the prices are great. The sake harasu is amazing; I highly recommend it. Check it out and support your local businesses."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant. We tried the hibachi. A party of 6. The menu offers 50% off, such as filet, shrimp, scampi, lobster and so on. We had a great time and the food was excellent. We'll be back. It's great for groups no more than eight per table."}
{"text":"Got in and was seated right away.  Waitress got our drinks then nobody came back to take our order until we flagged another waiter - about 15 mins.  Food is very good but the service is terrible.  We had to flag the staff to get their attention.  Only once did someone stopped by and here on us.  They also gave us the bill without asking if we need anything else.  We had to remind them on the kids dessert and the waiter looked surprised like he didn't know it came with it."}
{"text":"This place rules. I usually just get the regular rolls and those are 1/2 off which u can't beat. The other dishes like the orange peel chicken and sweet and sour soup are super good too! They are really fast with service as well."}
{"text":"I have ordered to-go from here about 5 times and eaten at the restaurant once.  In my opinion it was a little slow (but that could be because I was starving) thus I prefer to order ahead and pick it up.  The menu is very extensive and gives lots of options.  The food is good quality and delicious.  While not fancy this place is a good neighborhood option and I am definitely a regular now.  My personal favorite is the Chow Mein (beef and chicken are delicious).  Other favorites that my friends have liked: Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Buddha's Delight (Mixed Veggies), and Sweet and Sour Chicken."}
{"text":"Food is good if you don't mind waiting an hour to get your order. Maybe you can visit with the other 3 people in the restaurant. They think that offering free dessert makes up for it. No thanks"}
{"text":"My son and I come for lunch here a lot. I always have the Japanese tempura box lunch. 4 nice sized shrimp and 4 huge vegetables. Miso soup is good and salad and rice too. I've had this for years actually and it even got better this last time. My son has the spicy crab rolls and the tuna poke which he says is the best anywhere in the valley. Service has always been quick and friendly. No complaints. Easy to get in and out of the shopping center where it's located."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots. Furniture needs to be replaced otherwise food quality is great."}
{"text":"Love the teppanyaki here and it's a bonus that it's always 40% off. Although there's not much atmosphere, the food is good - particularly the fried rice. Great spot for a fun night out without the Benihana price tag."}
{"text":"The price and variety of the menu is a plus but the quality of the food is not great. I got the chef special that had all three meats but it tasted bland and wasn't worth it"}
{"text":"Good service, good food and sushi, and the prices are decent. Giving this a 4 star because as i said, everything is okay but nothing is spectacular or better than other places in the area."}
{"text":"this is a great place to get asian bistro for asian food lovers! i really enjoyed the variety of foods and sushi. the regular rolls are 50% off which is very inexpensive and overall makes a great meal!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The sushi was fresh and delightful and the beef and broccoli was delicious. My only issue was with the service. Although the service was not bad... it was far from great, especially because the place was empty. All in all it was a good experience and I am looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"This spot is our go to if the hubby and I can't decide on where to eat. Good quality and great prices; it's always half off on all of their regular rolls. One star knocked off for service. If you sit at a table be prepared to be ignored. My advice: just sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Quick and easy.  If you are looking for decent sushi I would check this place out.  They are always running amazing deals on the sushi and it is made to order.  Nothing too fancy here, but some solid food for sure.  Try the spicy scallop role, one of favorites."}
{"text":"I don't know why every time I get a to go and I ask for white rice I always get brown? I love the staff. But will have to start checking their work. So not into babysitting. :( Hate to rate with stars. Giving a 3 which is better than average."}
{"text":"This was a nice place. It had a great blend of hibachi grill and sushi. Something for everyone. They also run a lot of coupon sales available on their website."}
{"text":"Third time coming here with my friend and honestly I don't know why we decided to go the cheaper route and not pay for all you can eat at another sushi place. It's 40% off regular rolls now, not 50%, because somehow they think their sushi is that high quality that it deserves 10% more. We didn't finish even half of our sushi (we ordered 6 rolls). They think that throwing mayonnaise on top of every roll makes it taste better and the spicy tuna roll they cooked? Not to mention both our stomachs hurt after so.... we asked for the check ASAP and walked out. Customer service is rude too... if we're being honest Smith's grocery store sushi is 10x better and I'd pay double the price I did here. Keep in mind this is coming from an avid all you can eat sushi goer. I know what sushi should and shouldn't taste like. Oh & our booth was taped with duct tape because there was rips. I wish Gordon Ramsey would visit this restaurant just to verify I'm not kidding. I'm surprised this got more than 1 star review."}
{"text":"I am not trying to be harsh, I'm just going to be honest. When I found out they had teppanyaki for $20 I was excited because it's my favorite and that's way less expensive than my normal places. Now I see why it's so cheap. It was literally the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever been to.   My friend and I tried the sushi and teppanyaki. The sushi wasn't as fresh as it should be, so we moved to the teppanyaki section of the restaurant.  My friend and I ordered steak and fried rice. The quality of steak (NY strip) was the worst I've ever had. Even Panda Express has better quality steak than this place. The fried rice was super dry and had a funny after taste. I was extremely disappointed when I left. It would have been amazing to find a yummy place in Henderson that was this inexpensive. Sadly, I will have to keep looking."}
{"text":"So we arrived there for dinner yesterday after spotting it last week leaving walgreens . Dining room was empty and not one clean table available . Place was dirty so we can only imagine what the kitchen looks like . With that in mind we left and don't plan on ever going back ."}
{"text":"You wont be disappointed the food is amazing.  Whenever I ask anyone where they want to eat its always in unison Ta Ta's! I love the Lisa Hand Roll. The soup variety is amazing.  If you don't want sushi there is a  Hibachi grill where the chef provides entertainment.  This is a casual restaurant and the prices a reasonable."}
{"text":"I ordered on Friday night going into labor day weekend.The food was awful.I don't know about the sushi,but I ordered combo fried rice which was so mushy you couldn't even make out it was rice.No seperated pieces of rice did not have any shrimp in it and the meat that was in it I could not tell you what it was. I also ordered general chicken that was very tuff and chewy and weired shapes and sizes short and round to long as my finger.Never had it like that before.The mongolian beef was a poor quality of meat.texture didn't seem like beef.Very poor meal.Very dissatisfied.And it cost me $33.00 for that mess.Never ever again.Decor was not very nice.Not a well kept place lots of clutter.It was close and had good reviews.But apparently you can't trust that either."}
{"text":"Completely unorganized. Placed a to go order at 6 and 30 Mins later still waiting on it. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I order for delivery all the time the food is great and the price you can't beat the lunch box is 10 bucks and you get so much food I would recommend this to any one in the area it's not good enough to travel for but if you live near by I def recommend it"}
{"text":"The quality of food during lunch seems to differ greatly from the food served during dinner. The chicken teriyaki was very tough and dry. My hot and sour soup was extremely bland and overly starchy. The sushi rolls were 80% rice with small bits of questionably fresh fish inside. My shrimp in lobster sauce had a generous serving of shrimp, but the sauce was very bland. They also put my egg roll right in the sauce, so it was soggy by the time I got to eat it. Service is still barely average. I will not write off Ta Ta yet, just because I have enjoyed their dishes during dinner time in the past."}
{"text":"I usually write great reviews on yelp, I'm not one to take the time to complain but this place was awful from start to finish! It took them 10 mins to get us water and another 10 mins to take our order. The horrible experience started with Nigri. The fish looked limp discolored and smelled bad! I eat sushi as much as possible usually at Yama Sushi which is amazing but this was really bad quality and made me afraid to try the next round of food. We got overly salty Miso soup, dried steamed white rice, mushy fried brown rice, who makes fried rice with brown rice and who screws up steamed rice!! The owner/manager comes out to ask about the Nigiri telling me they make their fried rice with brown rice to make it healthier! lmao its FRIED rice!! We ordered teriyaki chicken plate, dry and hard to chew. Orange chicken and fried rice weren't even touched dragon roll was ok cause it was fried not raw fish. We literally left all our food untouched and they could care less. As we leave we find the owner/manager sitting on a bench smoking right outside the front door! I've been in the restaurant business my whole life and have never ever had such horrible service and horrible food I am beyond pissed I paid $86 dollars for absolute garbage! Stay clear of this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard many mixed reviews on Ta Ta's that I had to try it out for myself. It's located in the strip mall on the corner of Stephanie and Horizon Ridge.  There is plenty of parking.  The dining area is huge.  Honestly the floors could use a little bit of vacuuming but otherwise it was fine.    I decided to try the one of their sushi rolls which contained crab tempura.  It was really over done.  It almost had a burnt taste so I wasn't too thrilled with that.  I also had the General Tso's Chicken which came with a little side of rice.  The chicken was good but could have been a little more spicy.  Maybe it is just a request that must be made when ordering.   Service was just ok.  We had to wait a while to get our drinks refilled.  I would try them again but maybe take it to go.  I'm hoping some of their other dishes are better."}
{"text":"Hhmm Im really leaning on giving this place a two given the sticky menus, the unswept carpet and my soup bowl that had some sort of crumb residue on it. But the tempura shrimp and veggies I had were not too bad and I didn't get sick on both times I was dragged along here.   Their customer base is made up of young families and on both visits no one didnt seem to mind the mess. Im assuming alot were regular customers by the way everyone interacted with the staff.    The service was on point, had no problems issuing separate checks.  The price of the meal was a good value. What I had was pretty decent.  So three stars since my guts survived. Not in any hurry to go back though but will keep this place in mind for cheap eats."}
{"text":"I fear telling the world about this place will only make it harder for me to get a table. Love the food. Can not beat these prices!! I eat here quite often and I would give 5 stars but the service can be spotty. My kids love the teppan  table and they give them a good show. Sushi is fresh and also an amazing price compared to most places. Highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a great Chinese takeout place and Tata Bistro takes the prize. We have never dined in so I can't say much for that experience but so far We've ordered take out three times and it has been fantastic each time. So far we have tried the egg rolls which were so so. My husband absolutely loves the General chicken. Our other favorites are the Honey Walnut Prawns and Mongolian Beef."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite little secrets.  They do half off hibachi. I don't think it starts until 5pm but it's worth it. I got filet and chicken and my bill was $12! It's usually more if i drink and get sushi but the sake is also Bogo and the sushi rolls (the basic ones) are also half off.  Don't tell people about my secret gem!!! I love how it's never super busy. Walk in, sit down, eat, leave. Cheap and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!  All grill table entrees are 50% off!!!!  Cant beat the deal!!!  Make sure to make a reservation if you plan on sitting at the grill table, there are only 2, yes 2 grill tables!!!"}
{"text":"From the name and Yelp listing (Asian fusion, Chinese, thai?), I wouldn't have been able to tell that they serve sushi- but it's actually a hibachi/sushi joint in the style of Bennihana or Ohjah. Front windows advertise 50% off regular rolls and teppanyaki.  This place is a steal, for sushi: $40 got us two regular rolls, two special rolls, and a gigantic salmon skin hand roll, plus tax and tip for two. The pricing can't really be beat. Their discounted regular rolls are decent (if a bit heavy handed on the rice), but the garlic ponzu sauce had an odd chemical after taste that I did not care for at all. The WHATS WRONG and MUMMY special rolls were both artistically presented and tasty, with ample amounts of fresh fish. And that hand roll was gigantic!   Good value for the sushi found here. Service was decent, attentive without being overbearing. Check the specials board behind the sushi bar for featured rolls: the Lady Gaga Roll sounded good, and the What's Wrong was a hit.   Note that they have a large dining area: they were able to accommodate a 10 person graduation dinner group without reservations without a problem."}
{"text":"Uh. No.  First off, the first thing you do is walk into a restaurant that has a FILTHY door....  It really makes that red \"People Love us on Yelp\" sticker stand out.  The place was as busy as I've ever seen it. But the three of us and our baby were able to get a booth no problem.  The booths are really weird. I'm 5'9'' and the table sits super low, and the cushions are uncomfortably high. At least this was the booth that we sat in. An older gentleman stopped by to take our drinks, I asked for water and extra ice.  Our drinks come....No extra ice. *sigh*  Okay, so the \"regular\" rolls are half priced....So tell me, why haven't you changed the pricing on the menus? Doesn't make much sense to me...Seeing as how this promotion has gone on for almost a year.  Before we ordered, we asked to be split checks. We asked the waitress if we should get two pieces of paper to order...she told us no. We put in our order, and the first part of it comes out pretty fast (regular hand rolls and soup)....almost too fast. So, the boys eat their hand rolls and I wait. ..  Our rolls come out, and they are just lack luster. Nothing special to tell you the truth. Nothing looked fresh, or tasted ...that fresh. This was the last time we saw our waitress, by the way.  So, there we are, out of drinks, waiting for someone to acknowledge us. A few people, INCLUDING THE OWNER, walk by and check on other tables, but not us. It wasn't until AFTER we asked for the check  and boxes that we got refills.  We get the refills, still no boxes.  We get the boxes, and the check comes.  And what do you know, it's not split. We once again, wait for someone to even look our way to try and have it corrected.  We both had our wallets out, ready to pay when the new bills were dropped off. We put them at the edge of the table. One with cash laying down, and the one with the card standing up...  A pretty good hint, don't you think? No, we still waited. We flagged down a busser to take the checks. He comes back with the card, and says that my \"change is coming\"... Uh, what? who did you pass my money to?  So, still waiting, about a good 20 minutes since we tried to leave....my change comes back. We tipped a decent amount and booked out of there.  Sorry, this fish is not worth the wait, the price or the crappy atmosphere.  Our friend even left his box of leftovers, ON PURPOSE. Terrible food, terrible service.  No thanks."}
{"text":"A follow up to my last review...By the next morning we were both very sick to our stomach with the dreaded trips to the toilet through the night.  No doubt it was the old barbecued pork.  We only had a few pieces before I couldn't eat it because it tasted bad.  We were both excited to see it as an appetizer and probably gave it too much of a chance.  When the waitress said yes it was a few days old....it had to be at least a week old or longer to spoil like that.   They are one of those places that tries to carry to much of a variety and unfortunately not good at very much. Initially we were excited to try a Chinese food restaurant that was dine in and not fast food and really excited by Japanese too but both were very disappointing.  After getting sick from the pork...we are done! They have a cute dining area but it isn't clean.  The carpet was gross and looked old and not vacuumed for a month.  The inside of the windows were filthy and looked like muddy large hand prints high up and smeared down the window...gross.  If their cleanliness inside is that bad, it explains how the kitchen is ran and how they could serve spoiled food. We really wanted to like them but honestly I think if an health inspector went there...they would shut them down. The amazing part was both times there, they were busy.  Must be cheap prices in exhange for low quality food."}
{"text":"This place is my secret go-to for relatively awesome sushi for how inexpensive it is. Don't come here expecting TOP TIER sushi, you'll be sorely disappointed. But that's not a bad thing! It's still tasty, and you won't spend a fortune, either. I haven't had a bad roll here yet. Also, their tuna poke is splendid. The staff is also very polite. Eat here! It's great!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is horrible.  I've been going here for 3 years, nothing has changed.  At least you get to save money on tips since the servers aren't good lol  The servers are always so quiet, sometime I walk in the restaurant and I don't even notice they are near me because they don't greet you loud enough.    I had a male server with red hair yesterday and he hardly said a word to me.  I've been working in customer service and food and beverage since I was in high school.  If the servers can at least smile instead of looking like they are just wishing their shift would end, that would be pretty neat.  At least the food is good!:)"}
{"text":"I always take friends here or suggest this place when going for sushi.   There happy hour specials are awesome!!! we always talk to the chefs at the sushi bar, and very good people.  Good clean environment!!!! Go check them out"}
{"text":"This is the first time in years I walked out of restaurant due to extremely poor food quality.    Hubby and I ordered two soups one was a Hot and Sour Soup and the other was Egg Drop Soup. Both soups were so overly thickened with cornstarch it glopped off the spoon making it look more like baby snot than soup. I tasted a tiny spoonful of egg soup and it was completely flavorless. Both soups remained completely full on the table top.   Next came out the sushi plates. I ordered the Warm Spring roll. Upon its arrival to the table I knew I couldn't eat it and didn't even try. What freaked me out  was it was so loosely rolled it was falling apart and was totally soupy/wet looking and even more disturbing was its very weird color.  Hubby ordered a different roll with many of the same unpleasant characteristics however he braved it and ate 1 piece.  After the first bite he then promptly stated we needed to get a waiter pronto.   We flagged over a waiter and told them we had to leave due to the quality not being what we expected.   They were gracious and offered us an opportunity to order something else but we declined knowing we had to get out of there.   They did not charge us anything for the 2 sushi plates and 2 cups of soup that sat totally uneaten on the table (minus 1 bite of sushi & 1 slurp of soup).   I really hope others have better luck here but I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"My girl and I hit up the Ta Ta after the gym. On this particular day we had both taken two classes so we were ready to turn it out. Good thing we stopped by here. We ordered a big bowl of soup, lettuce cups app and a garlic chicken entree. Never made it to the entree and that is rare b/c I eat like a horse, np, we took it home. Soup was so good and the lettuce cups huge. If you like good food and lots of it this is your place as it has now become mine, love it."}
{"text":"Good food at good prices.  I like doing the hibachi grill, way cheaper than benihana and just as good.  They only have 2 grills so reservation is a must.  They have a sushi bar as well as a restaurant additionally to the grills.  Never left unsatisfied my favorite is the fried rice on the hibachi with some steak cook to order!  yum yum.   There is a big scary looking fish in the back that looks like it wants to eat you.  That's is all."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Wide variety of sushi and Japanese diners. Share the chefs show around the hibachi grill or relax at a comfy table. Friendly wait staff completes the experience."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! We always go to the hibachi grill. The staff is great and the food is always plentiful and delicious. I always get the filet and chicken. Of course the chef is very friendly and makes the evening enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yelp requires that I give a star-rating--so there's this restaurant's undeserving ONE star.   Mind you, fellow yelpers, that I've had fresh fish--as in freshly caught on a boat, filleted, sliced and served as sashimi on the spot. So being in the desert, I've come to accept freshly thawed.   Sushi here is the worst I've tried in the valley due to poor fish quality. You could immediately tell from the appearance and rubbery mouth-feel. Nigiris are more than a mouthful which is another flag.   They obviously could see our sushi orders were hardly touched--no recovery effort. We walked out with an overall feeling of disgust. I don't get the raving reviews AT ALL. First and very last visit."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but this place, stay away! They brought us triple delight on an Applebees Fajita skillet. We ordered a dragon roll but it never came out and the waitress was incredibly rude. Buddha Belly Deli is a better place for Asian.  And for the record, I'm writing this from a toilet stall. My friends and I are stuck in here because of this terrible place"}
{"text":"I went for an earl dinner, it wasn't too busy. After friendly greeting we were seated at booth. It seemed a little hot inside so we requested they turn up the AC which they did.  Our Order was taken and brought to the table in timely manner. The food and drinks were good, at a great price. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The California roll was fresh and delicious. We also had the appetizer sampler plate, the pork fried rice and chicken chow mein, and egg rolls, hot saki, white wine(icy cold mmm), and Sapporo beer. We ordered sweet sour chicken and orange chicken for later.   There were no negative issues. I will definitely return as a customer.  Thank you Ta Ta's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. All of their regular rolls are half off and their hand salmon and sushi rolls have actual pieces of meat instead of that minced stuff that normally comes with hand rolls."}
{"text":"I usually order to go at Ta-Tas, this is my favorite sushi restaurant in Henderson, & they have half price regular rolls. They dont even ask my name anymore when I call, they know me and my usual order that well! When I go in to pick up or in the off chance I do go and dine in, I hope to see Alice she is in my opinion the best waitress there. I always order their spicy tuna and yum yum salmon rolls, and my mom is a big fan of their california crunch and Philly rolls, my dad who is not a fan of sushi is pleased with the large portions of noodles and beef plates they have. All around great place!"}
{"text":"Clean & spacious spot to dine. Service for the most part is usually pretty good, and the food is prepared pretty quick. Prices are good, especially for he portions. I like the fact i can order a big dish of noodles or noodle soup with a sushi roll on the side."}
{"text":"Went there friday night and we sat at the bar and the people were very friendly. Even the reg customers .my fish was very fresh and i enjoyed it and i will be back....i was also told about how good this place was from a client.."}
{"text":"I came here twice when I was out in Las Vegas visiting my cousin over the Christmas/New Year's holiday. Sushi rolls at 40% off, how can you beat that? Both times we had at least one box of left overs if not more and they still tasted great the next day.  One of my favorite rolls is the touchdown. It comes with a pile of scallops on top. Don't be afraid to try any of the non-traditional rolls because they are very good.  We came here New Year's eve and had a great time eating, chatting and doing sake bombs. I think the whole restaurant was quite entertained by us. The staff was friendly and the service was great. I hope to be back again the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We went for my husband's birthday and we've got the worst service from the chef ever. Didn't give us a show but gave us the worst attitude a chef or a staff that could give of. It was such a waste of time and money. We will never go to Tata Bistro ever again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately yelp requires me to rate at least one star, but this restaurant does not deserve it. I would strongly encourage anyone considering this restaurant for any reason to make a different choice. Service was so bad we were here over 2 hours, after which they had the balls to charge us gratuity on average $8.00 a check. Please go somewhere else and save yourself a headache."}
{"text":"Super yummy sushi for a fairly good price. Half off on the basic rolls , and have a great and fun habachi table. The staff is nice and the environment is chill. Great place !"}
{"text":"I gotta say the biz isn't ran correctly. This review isn't about their food quality, but it's about their 2 different menus. Ya see, we went there and they sat us at the grill and gave us menus. I immediately knew i wanted the steak & shrimp with a sushi roll on the side. That's what i always get when i go there. Well, just before ordering, another group came in and had reservations for the grill, which the Ta Ta staff assumed was us.So, we then got moved into the dining room and i was told that \"those menus no good over there, i give you different one.\" So i review the menu and find no steak and shrimp. I ask our waiter and he says that's only at the grill, not over here. So my question was why can't they throw the steak and shrimp on the grill with the other groups food. I got no response. Osaka's does that and works off of one menu, no matter where you are sitting. I felt like a second class citizen when they changed the menu on me. I won't be back and would highly recommend Osaka's, both in Henderson & Vegas, over this place anytime."}
{"text":"The food is just okay, nothing out of the norm. I enjoy the friendly staff at the bar side so thanks to that."}
{"text":"Food was alright a little bit to salty for me. I think that it can use a little improvement and work on the customer service skills. Overall it was a good place and I think that it's worth a try. I would probably not go here again but I would still recommend it for anyone who wants to go for Japanese and Chinese food."}
{"text":"standard asian fusion. nothing spectacular.  decent service, decent food but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight based on other Yelp reviews & we found a new favorite spot. The taste was perfect, the ambiance was relaxing, the staff was friendly, and the price was right. This place is definitely a winner!  I ordered the Garlic Long Bean entrée. It was basically a plate of stir fried garlic, green beans, and pork in a savory sauce; the flavor hit every note just right! The brown rice paired with the stir fry sauce perfectly, so when I was done all I had was an empty plate & a full belly.  Between the two of us with drinks, entrées, & a delicious house salad, the price came to $23 (& worth every penny).  I saw some complaints about service, but I honestly think those folks didn't get that it was supposed to be part of the atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend coming here in a rush. The staff served us as a team; we had 4 or so people check on us & bring our goodies. They took their time at first, giving us plenty of time to settle in and choose or items, but once we had our order in everything was quick & friendly. The time we spent waiting just gave me time to take in the simple yet relaxing surroundings.  I'd highly recommend Ta Ta. The 4 stars are mostly because I didn't have enough room to try the sushi..."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. The only issue is that seating at the hibachi is very limited so you should call ahead on busy nights."}
{"text":"Five years ago, my friend and I were out apartment hunting and looking for somewhere to eat. We ate here and it was great! I have since moved to this side of town, and suggested this place as a first date spot a couple weeks ago. I raved and raved about the place, and we gave it a whirl. They have a couple hibachi tables, sushi bar, and regular seating in a rather large dining room from most Asian places.  We grabbed a booth and were greeted immediately with drink order.  We looked over the menu and decided to go with 3 sushi rolls, and an order of orange chicken.  I was really looking forward to the orange chicken as it's been a while since I've had it.  Sushi came out first and was looking meh?  The descriptions said \"yum yum sauce\" and another said \"eel sauce\", yet another said \"spicy mayo\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them. We had to ask for them on the side. Ok, maybe that's the norm...it was still good, not the best I've had but ok.  The orange chicken was thinly sliced chicken which I don't like, I like cubed chicken and now I sound like a primadonna.  I only say this because I've ordered orange chicken from a place around the corner from my house, and it's cubed, and fried perfectly. This was kind of flimsy and not too \"sauced\".    The comedic portion of the evening...my date and I were chatting away, and after finishing the sushi, he put his chopsticks on the plate. He was about to get some orange chicken, but the waitress swooped by and snatched up his plate. I looked at him mouth wide open saying, omg, I guess we're done eating now?   They asked us if we wanted refills on our soda, and we replied yes please, Coke.  Each waitress picked up the glass, stared at the side almost as if she was trying to figure out what was inside, and said ok ok. Not sure what that was about, but it was funny.   On a positive note, we're still seeing each other despite my first date dinner pick."}
{"text":"Love this place for hibachi it's half off all the time the service is usually so good the menu has changed a little bit you used to get dipping sauces for your hibachi steak and chicken but not anymore and fried rice was included now it's $2.50 extra that part is disappointing but it's cheap and a fun experience for the entire fam"}
{"text":"Big restaurant. Your choice of Japanese sushi bar, Teppenyaki, or Chinese. Good lunch specials starting at $6.95 and includes one entree, choice of white rice or brown, soup and egg roll. Standard place nothing really special but food was good and I'd come back."}
{"text":"A coworker turned me on to this place. Was craving sushi for dinner and remembered they had a special going on that month: we had 50% off all rolls! 5 of us had 13 rolls between us, and it was under $40. Every roll we sampled was delicious.  Had Tata again during lunch. Ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box that comes with tempura. The tempura was delightful, teriyaki was just alright.  Great choice if you're craving sushi and need to pinch pennies."}
{"text":"The prices.  Can't beat 'em in this town.  The sushi itself is pretty good considering how inexpensive it is, you get a lot for the money and it doesn't matter that it applies to a limited menu.  The service is good, the tables are clean, and the staff is friendly.  I really don't need anything more from a sushi joint."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit run down and needs to be cleaned and updated, but the food and the service is faultless. I'm addicted. Excellent pricing as well."}
{"text":"It was ok. The best thing was the general Tao chicken. The sushi was not fresh.  We ordered the chow mien which had no flavor and the shrimp tempura which was disgusting ( I told my kids to spit it out ). It didn't even taste like shrimp just mush.  They also were very confused and didn't know what they were doing. We have a table of six with 2 adults and 3 kids. I ask for cheaters chopsticks for the kids and utensils for us all.  I received 1 chopstick ?!!!! And then 2 forks???  What are supposed to do?? Share our forks too??  Not going back. Only thing good was the price"}
{"text":"Although the quality of the food isn't the best I visited this place multiple times because of proximity from work.  I will never step foot in that place. Ordered a few items and immediately noticed a weird smell (dirty rag/dirty dog/wet cat/damp socks). As soon as I placed the plate of sushi in front of me it was apparent that the source of the smell was something on my plate. To top it off the customer service is horrible. Waitress ignored us.. sushi cheff literally took 20 minutes to simply acknowledge that we were there when there were only 2 other people at the counter. There are plenty of other good places to spend $60 bucks on lunch and this is definately not one of them."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken and broccoli in the dark sauce. Huge portions. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"The worst Asian food I've ever had!  I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was flavorless and rubbery!!! I ordered 3 meals and we were all in agreement that it was disgusting we all threw our meals away after taking two bites. The biggest waste of money, and it was $15 a meal. Just stay away from this place, in addition to the food being flavorless it was also cold and the service was terrible the guy I talked to on the phone to place my order with was extremely rude!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We enjoy the teppenyaki table. make sure you make a reservation prior. You can't beat the prices here. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I desperately wish that this place was clean. Food is decent price is right. But I cannot bring myself to eat there due to the cleanliness issue. If the soy sauce bottles are disgusting and haven't been wiped down in God knows how long and the front host desk is covered in a layer of dust and then what is going on in the kitchen? If the part of the restaurant that is visible to the customers is this dirty what's happening in the part of the restaurant that's not visible? I wish that the health department would come in and do something about it. Or I just simply wish that they would clean it up because I cannot bring myself to eat here. Also I had ordered a noodle dish and in the description was nothing about meat. I specifically ordered it because I didn't want to meat it came with some unidentified meat on top of it and even the server didn't know what kind of meat it was."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times in 10 days 12/29 lunch. EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!!!  12/30. Went back. Brought 2 friends EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!!  1/13 went there for dinner with 2 more friends  Sushi was very tasty and fresh  BUT!!!!! Could not have gotten worse service 1. We asked for water several times.  2. One of our dishes we ordered was duck. We asked them to hold all the dinner orders so they would come out at the same time. We asked them to not cook it until we finished our sushi. We were told that the duck takes 45 minuets to cook so they started it right a way (we were fine with the 45 minuets). Well 10 min latter here comes our duck and other dinner items   We had just started our sushi. Asked them to hold it  3. Soup was very cold. We asked them to fix it It came back just as cold   4. We then asked for our duck and other orders They came back ice cold  5. I sent one dish back which was to cold to eat and they tried charging for for it  The manager refused to come out to talk to use   Yes we did ask to speak to him or her  We will try it one more time. Probably without any guests. Let's hope next time is the charmer"}
{"text":"Good lunch specials.  I've had both the kitchen stuff (chicken teriyaki) and the sushi and they're both fantastic.  The chicken teriyaki is made from the good stuff, not the cheap gamey parts of the chicken as many other restaurants do.    The sushi has always been fresh, and I especially love the clam nigiri (I'm pretty sure it was clam?)-- they put a great sauce on it that's slightly oniony but mostly sweet.  It's excellent.  The sushi special comes with five pieces of nigiri and a spicy tuna roll (or california roll) and then the miso soup.  I really like their food.  Now for the bad.  This is not a huge deal for me as I generally get take out during my lunch hour and then eat at school, but their restroom is GROSS-- they really need to do a better job of keeping things clean.  This is not a one-time problem as I have seen it on several occasions and it always looks like it needs to be cleaned.  I can imagine this being really gross to someone who came to eat in with their friends or something, its a bit of an embarrassment."}
{"text":"Went for my daughter's 15th birthday and it was terrible..I have been here over 20 times and this was the absolute worst ever. We did the hibachi table and he was so boring and non talkative, we do hibachi for a reason, because its usually fun and exciting to watch and the cook is usually really good. Not this time. Also,our steaks (mine and my daughters) were bad. I could smell it as soon as he he put them down and I tasted it then I waited for my daughter to taste hers and it was bad also. I immediately brought it to his attention and he wanted to argue with me and that it doesn't make sense why 2 are bad and the other one wasn't. I said I don't know but I'm in the industry and I know bad meat when I smell it. He sat there and argued with me and then called the manager over and they spoke Spanish about the whole dinner in front of other people it was very embarrassing and they gave me a $10 discount off my check..very unhappy with the whole experience. Disappointed because this has been one of my favorite places to eat for years and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was new to Sushi and we were trying this place out for the first time.  My daughter has severe allergies to all kinds of nuts but has eaten in several sushi places. We first asked the hostess if she could tell us if there were nuts in the food, not good with English she was more interested in the conversation with the waiter who spoke English but told us  he could not talk to us right now,  . We asked to speak with the chef or manager, and man came up and said \"what you want\" we then asked if he was a manager  and could we speak to the chef \"my chef no speak English what you want I am the owner\" by now he was almost yelling he was very gruff and i had already decided not to eat there, She went on to explain her allergies and would it be safe to eat there, he really did not want to talk about it said \"no, i don't know!\" He is the owner and \" he don't know? We left,I can deal with language barriers i cannot deal with rude, and in this day and age everyone should be aware of allergies and be able to accommodate, we went down the street to another sushi place, they bent over backwards to help us served us a wonderful dinner and we will return, it was also a lot cleaner than Ta Ta's .We have been all over the world with her allergy and  this was one of the more unpleasant occurrences we have had. Shame on you for dismissing a patron because you are to lazy to deal with an allergy."}
{"text":"Walk in, stand there.... stand there.... and continue to stand there. Bar staff sees us and just continues to chat amongst themselves.... waiting staff walk past us with not even a simple \"hi, someone will be right with you\".......party of four still standing there..... 15 minutes of that and it was off to another restaurant. I feel like we probably dodged a bullet."}
{"text":"This place was really good the X Files roll rocked. It was slow on a Saturday for a lunch we could not stop eating. The place was clean and the fish was fresh tasting."}
{"text":"This used to be the place I'd head to after school with a couple friends when we'd crave simple sushi (and before we realized what AYCE sushi was all about).   Came here on a weekday for a late lunch. It was pretty dead aside from one other table in the restaurant, and service was just okay. Definitely friendly, but a bit slow and not very excited to be there. I get it, slow day.  Thankful for 1/2 off regular rolls because I just wanted some sushi, not too much. (But do realize that because it is 1/2 off, some of the rolls including the ones I got were fairly small.)   My brother ordered a teriyaki plate because he can't eat fish, and it came out almost 10 'min after getting my food, which I feel was too long for him to wait seeing as my food was taunting us on the table (we're courteous and eat when everyone gets their food). Overall, still good food, okay service. Their 1/2 off regular rolls are still the reason I come back!"}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER HAD. overall the food isn't bad for the price but the service is the reason why I won't be coming back to Tata's. I went to dinner with my cousin (who hates mushrooms) and when our order was being taken she specifically said she didn't want mushrooms and when the cook came to prepare our food at the hibachi table he told us he was going to cook it all together and that she can just \"pick them out\" . Right then we should have left. Then at the end of our meal we asked for to-go boxes and the busser who was grabbing them for us rolled his eyes at us and shook his head as if we were bothering him. The prices are decent but they take advantage, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here about once every week or two since it is right around the corner from my house. If I am in a rush I can usually be in and out within 10-15 mins. Walk in, sit down at the bar, greet my usual chef and place my order. He asks me about work, I ask him about life, then we part ways. As good as it gets.   The Food: The hand cut rolls have been half off since I moved to Henderson so they usually cost around $2.50 a piece. Now, considering we are dealing with raw fish it may be a little concerning but I have never had a bad experience.   The service: Next time I go in I'll have to make formal introductions but I usually deal with the same Chef behind the bar. Funniest experience I have had was watching him become all flustered when the place was busy. I felt comfortable enough to laugh at him. Awesome guy though; Very genuine.   My bill is usually between $9-$12 dollars but I always leave a $20."}
{"text":"Awesome place, very friendly staff and very good sushi chefs. Check out their sushi specials, you won't be disappointed. Albert is an awesome chef"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here with a few friends who are regulars.. We always sit at the bar and the sushi chefs are great people and very kind.. This is my new weekly stop for great sushi rolls at amazing prices"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service.  Sushi was excellent.  Overall 4 star not a 5.  The best dish after the sushi was the combination tempura dish. I had the Sweet and sour pork.  It was average.  The several noodle dishes at our table were all excellent."}
{"text":"I went here alone, actually.  I was on my way to work, and I had a little extra time and money, and I was recommended to here by a friend, so I took a shot.  Have to say, it was pretty good.  The food was delicious, and quick to come out.  The sushi was very good as well, and they served brown rice upon request, which is a very big plus!   The prices are all reasonable, and the people are very nice.    Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food. They have 40% off hibachi. I had steak and shrimp for $12. Can't beat that! Regular sushi rolls are also 40% off. This was my first time trying this place, but would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out with my boyfriend. The staff is very nice. Their sushi is really good; half off of the regular rolls only. We had the Japanese lasagna, spicy tuna, and the garlic albacore!"}
{"text":"They have great deals, 50% off all regular rolls- seems to be an all day every day special but they are delicious. The salmon skin, eel, and yum yum salmon roll were good. The other items are more typical but deals on sushi are great considering the price."}
{"text":"Solid four stars for good food, fast and friendly service, nice atmosphere. I was disappointed that the green tea was just a tea bag in the pot of water. Nothing stands out about this restaurant but certainly a good restaurant and a solid four star."}
{"text":"Been there a few times with no issues, but this last time, we got 2 sushi rolls brought to us that we did not order. When we started to ask the waitress about it she quickly walked away mid-sentence and brought us back the menu-sheet we marked to show us. Sure enough they were numbered, but not in our handwriting. And they weren't even remotely close to anything we like or would normally order, so I KNOW it was not a mistake on our part. The whole thing made me really suspicious and mad. I don't know if it was a mix up and was supposed to be someone else's order (marked by the chef on the wrong sheet), or if it was on purpose bc we were \"difficult\" earlier and asked to move seats because it was EXTREMELY HOT sitting by the window where we were. Either way, they did not seem in any hurry to try to remedy the situation or even readdress it. I refused to pay it. Came out of the tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the NW corner of Horizon Ridge and Stephanie. It's behind the 7 Eleven and Metro Pizza. Visited 9/2/12  Was on the mood for some kinda nese like Japanese or Chinese . Ta Ta Bistro fit the bill nicely. Especially because I just walked out of another  restaurant close by because there were kids sitting on the floor coloring in the middle of the restaurant ( just wasn't the dining experience I was thinking of tonight ).  Ordered some sushi eel rolls, spicy tuna wrap and salmon wrap.  Also went in for the chicken teriyaki meal. This included salad, miso soup and large plate of juicy teriyaki chicken breast topped with great tasting sauce and sesame seeds. Plus rice of course white or brown. For the record I love Japanese style rice and I went with brown rice cuz I'm eating right. ( yeah right  :p )   Service was a little disorganized. But food all came with good presentation and good taste.  They have sushi bar, teppanyaki grill table, and not cramped table space. All good. but the decor is tired and needs a fresh look and vibe.   The restaurant has alot of food options and each time I come they deliver the goods. Timely, tasty, close by and really reasonable prices. Definitely not over the top but consistently good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ta Ta almost hits a home-run when it comes to making my belly happy.  The service is so fast I feel as if they are doing Jedi mind tricks anticipating what I am going to order! Always on top of my beverages and getting the food out quickly. The restaurant itself is clean and never crowded when I have been there. The food- Really nice sized portions, presentation and very fresh ingredients. I highly recommend the General Tso's Chicken or Garlic Chicken lunch specials. Both priced under $7.00 and come with soup, egg roll and rice. No extra charge for brown rice which is an added bonus. I do also enjoy the Dan Dan Noodles and the Garlic Long Bean. For all of you sushi lovers this is my family's number one choice for the price , flavor and size of the rolls.  The only reason why I am not rating them five stars is because when I am ready to leave a restaurant I want my bill and Ta Ta has left me hanging with dirty plates and no check every time. Other than that, I LOVE this place and highly recommend it to the world."}
{"text":"Great little hibachi joint tucked away in this shopping center.   I'm not sure if you have to make a reservation for hibachi or not. One of my friends did for our group and they was ready foe us as soon as we was seated.   I went with the steak and scallops. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and the star of my meal was the buttery fresh scallops! They use nice large scalops and my wifey even ate one and she hates scalops. This is a must for here to order. I opted for the fried rice on the side which tasted fantastic. Next the veggies was a little boring, that was the only draw back to the whole meal.  Service was prompt and friendly and the prices here are so reasonable."}
{"text":"Call me spoiled ...this sushi is gross and the orange chicken , well it was so thin I don't think it had chicken in it. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend NOT eating here.  I came here for lunch a few weeks ago and we sat at the sushi bar.  I ordered a California roll and a specialty roll.  The speciality roll had so much eel sauce on it I couldn't taste the sushi and it was so gross I couldn't finish my roll.  The California roll was just OK but you can't really screw up a California roll.  My friend got a spica tuna roll as well as a Chinese chicken entree.  She said the spicy tuna roll didn't taste right and the chicken in the Chinese entree didn't look cooked.  The place was empty not to mention.  The staff was observant and attentive however the food was just not worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is generally good. Something needs to be done about the facility though. The carpet is filthy, you can see dust on everything, the display in the front with the name on it is falling apart. This place needs a serious upgrade and a deep clean. Yikes!!"}
{"text":"Service is always great, sushi is awesome, the lunch and dinner specials are great. You never leave unhappy. It's not too far and kept nice and clean. I think I found my new hangout."}
{"text":"Come here if you're interested in bland rolls. The half price rolls are nice because they're so cheap, but you will literally get the quality you pay for. Half of the regular rolls come with NO sauce, and when I ask for a side of yum yum to make my roll tolerable I get a dirty look..EVERY time. I used to eat here a lot when I didn't know what sushi could actually be (amazing with sauces and flavors and FRESH). Even the tempura rolls are awful. They come over cooked & the breading is guaranteed to cut the inside of your mouth. The service is terrible, there are plenty of servers and bussers walking around, but none will stop by to refill drinks, it's like they almost ignore you. I don't know how everyone else likes to eat sushi, but I like to indulge in FLAVORS! (Eel sauce, yum yum sauce, jalapeños, spicy tuna, crunch topping, tempura, cream cheese, etc.) This is definitely not the place for quality service, nor quality sushi ... Unless you want to eat bland rubber."}
{"text":"This place was King's table Asian Buffet at one time, then it folded and then it was some other Asian Buffet and it folded again. We've dined there when it was King's Asian Buffet and it was just barely ok. Then once again at the second identity and we never went back again. Yesterday we tried for the third time as Ta Ta Bistro. Very impressive decor when we stepped inside (previously it was just a casual buffet set up). Nice fish tank, teppanyaki tables and as reported quite roomy inside. The menu had lots of choices with specials for lunch and dinner. A mix of Chinese and Japanese combined in one setting, hmmm?  seemed interesting. We picked several sushi selections off the order sheet and a roll #44 called the \"touchdown\". The sushi was just marginal, with no real outstanding flavors or presentation. The spider roll (deep fried softshell crab) had what is probably a pre-fried crab tempura that was refried a second time to \"freshen\" it up, shameful! Roll #44 was not a touchdown, but sadly a fumble. Seemed to be a deep fried creation with what we think is probably thousand island dressing as the accent sauce (blah!). I thought it was below average and my wife was throughly convinced and disliked it 100%. Overall impression was not very good and we won't be going back anytime soon.  Is it Chinese or Japanese? Which way is this restaurant leaning towards? Well when the bill arrived, there was the tell tale sign....2 fortune cookies. Maybe it's a Chinese restaurant trying to go both ways? Whatever the direction, we didn't like it very much. Our third visit under 3 different owners and like baseball. 3 strikes and we're out.  So to this Bistro, we sadly wave Ta Ta.  :-("}
{"text":"My friends and I have been here plenty of times. We always come with a huge group and get seated in the back area with several large tables. They offer some reasonably priced sake bombs and they have a wide variety of asian fusion. The sushi isn't half bad. However, ultimately it tries to please so many different kinds of Asian foods that it ends up being OK at everything but amazing at nothing. You can find better Teriyaki, Chinese, and sushi at a number of nearby places. Don't get me wrong-- its well worth visiting. But dont expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I've had my share of experiences with Chinese food and sushi. I'm no guru, but I must say that Tata's food is better than most places I've been to. The Lo-Mein, teriyaki chicken, and raw salmon are fresh and authentic. Staff is also warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"If you're split and can't decide if you're craving Japanese or Chinese food, or if you're like me and just want to have sushi and eat your honey walnut prawns too, then this is your jam right here.  First of all, regular rolls are half-off, all the time! I had the California Crunch and it was delicious. Regular rolls consists mostly of the simpler variety, and does not include all sushi that they offer. Regardless, there is still quite a selection from the sale section. However, a downfall with most fusion-type restaurants -- nothing really ever stands out when you cater to too many tastebuds, so don't expect high quality.   Second, this is where I'm docking stars -- do NOT get their Crispy Noodles Cantonese Style. It's listed under Chef Special, but there's absolutely nothing special about it. Looks great, but tasted horrible. Too salty!  Confirming with other reviewers, this place is clean and spacious, with a few hibachi grills and tables for days. We went on a Sunday afternoon and only one other table was there."}
{"text":"Good quality of food and service. In this area, there may be better quality around but this place is solid and affordable for the value.   It wasn't too busy when I made my visit. It was actually very quickly that we got sat down and had our drinks served too us. After making a few orders, the food slowly started to trickle in and they were really good!   The staff was really helpful and polite. The space is nice in here and not too busy.   I'm a huge fan of hibachis and Ta Ta definitely does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We went there and they couldn't accommodate us at the grill. They didn't even explain the menu was different and half off just said it was a half-hour wait. We won't be going back. We weren't impressed but would have been if customer service was better. We live nearby so they lost a lot of business because we're a large family."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for their 50% off deals for sushi. I was curious about the quality and wasn't expecting much, and good thing I had low expectations lol.   I ordered about 5 rolls so I could get a good idea of their menu. The only one that was decent was the lobster roll, but even that had too much sauce in it. The crunchy rolls were covered with a weird batter which was very unexpected. I am used to the crumbly, panko-like exterior. The shell was not really crunchy and didn't have much flavor. I feel like most of their rolls are just bland and they try to impart flavor through excessive use of sauce.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here for the sushi, even with the discount. The quality is just bad and I would rather pay a few more $ just to have something that I would enjoy eating. If you really don't mind the taste I guess this would be a good place to satisfy your sushi cravings without hurting your wallet that much. I may come back in the future to try their other food items, but that's if I don't have any other places to try lol."}
{"text":"Eh, the food is okay, sushi is okay... it's edible. I would much rather spend 50.00 dollars else where. The service is okay, my sisters sushi roll never came out so we canceled it"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan.  Currently there is a special.  50% off Teppanyaki and Sushi Rolls!  This place is literally 2 mins away from our home (5 min walk).  We were immediately greeted and was seated in the dining area.  I asked to seat us at the Teppanyaki table since we wanted that for dinner.  I got the scallops and filet mignon for $12.50 and Earl got the shrimp and filet mignon for $12.50 as well (that's w/the 50% discount).  Even though the portion size of the protein were noticeably smaller compared to...Osaka, it still is a good deal for 50%.  I also added a fried rice, which tacked on an extra $2.50.  Was well worth it!  The chef was a funny and cool.  Because there were only the 2 of us as the table, I asked for more butter and more garlic added to my filet mignon and fried rice.  Earl chose brown rice with his entrée.  Our food also included veggies, miso soup, and a bowl of salad.  This place rocks, and we will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the hibachi very much. I had the steak & shrimp and it was just as good as any of the other places Ive eaten hibachi at in the valley.   Several things stood out to me:  1. The veggies were perfectly done 2. This was hands down the fastest hibachi meal Ive ever had. One hour exactly from entering to leaving 3. It was much less crowded than other places AND... THE WINNER IS... 4. The PRICE! A meal for two was only $30!!! They must be trying hard to bring people in. There was a little sign on the menu that said half off entrees but I didnt believe it til we got the check. $11.50 for filet & shrimp?!? SOLD!"}
{"text":"It's a solid local place. I'm not going to go 5 stars because it isn't anything that special. It's just good, reasonably priced food with decent service. For grabbing some sushi or salad, you can do a lot worse than here. Plus, if you come at the right time, you can see rooms full of retired people playing cards. They know quality and value."}
{"text":"Just noticed my original review is getting dated. Still go here every chance I get. Been going for many years.   Dan Dan Noodles, Egg Rolls, Potstickers ( I prefer mine steamed), Wor Won Ton, Lemon Chicken... The list goes on.   Never had a meal I didn't like."}
{"text":"We had dinner there this evening around 530, Service was very poor and very slow. The food followed the service,Poor. I agree with Jeff K this place has struck out. Their prices aren't that reasonable, You pay PF Chang prices for a low grade Panda express ( sorry Panda Express)  We will not return to ta ta bistro."}
{"text":"Ta Ta is to me what McDonald's is to many Americans. When I'm too hungry and lazy to cook after work, I go to Ta Ta.   The four stars are for fair prices, convenient location, healthy food and (to copy from a fellow Yelper) \"feels like Cheers.\"  I've made new friends at Ta Ta and feel a sense of ownership over my seat at the bar. It's been our staple sushi spot for five years. That being said, I like the sushi at many other spots better.   Ta Ta's female sushi chef has the best personality. She is a great addition to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time now and have always liked the food even though the service as mostly been mediocre. However today I tried a new roll, and sadly I did not like. The waitress not only charged us for it anyways even though I had barely touched it but didn't even ask what was the issue or what I didn't like. It's sad that a place with good food overall can have such crappy customer service."}
{"text":"This place was a huge let down after the great reviews everyone left. We should have known when we walked in and it took them 10 mins to sit us down, when the restaurant was pretty much empty. We ordered some drinks and when they came around I went to hand our waitress the sushi order and she just walked away. She finally comes around and takes our sushi order. We tell her we are ready to order food off the menu as well (who wouldn't be ready after it took her forever to come back around) she looked at us upset. Then they started bringing out the sushi and it was disgusting even the Golden Dragon which was fried. Of course I start to inspect what I'm eating and the avocado was brown! We complained to the manager and he said that it was all fresh. Trust me I eat sushi enough to know when it's fresh. As well as to know that my avocado shouldn't be brown!! Then came the Sesame chicken which was completely bland. The white rice I don't know how but they managed to mess that one up too. Of course we couldn't order a side of fried rice it had to be a whole order. Well that was a huge mistake and a waste of money as well seeing as it came out looking like mush because they make their rice with Brown rice because, according to the manager \"It's fancier\".  The food is just as disgusting and horrible as the customer service. Avoid this place if you enjoy great sushi and great service!"}
{"text":"Best sushi hands down in las vegas, NV everytime I go it just keeps on getting better and better , there lasagne sushi is to die for.  And the prices are fair compared to these over priced sushi joints hope this helps with you're decision ."}
{"text":"We had dinner here.  We did the hibachi.  The steak, scallops, shrimp and chicken we excellent.  I preferred the steak , but everyone loves the shows and their food.  The cost was very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I hate to even speak about this place because I am afraid they will raise their prices if too many people know about them.  All teppanyaki and regular sushi rolls are 50% off menu price.  2 for 1 sake.  These aren't Happy Hour prices,  this is all the time.  Where else can you get shrimp, scallops, and lobster for around $20?  No where I know of, and let me know if there is another place.  The ambiance may not be the greatest, but the price for what you receive will make you look the other way.  By the way there is a nice white fish in a tank that if you go up and say hi he will follow you to the edge of the tank.  Remember he is a host and not for eating."}
{"text":"Probably the best teppanyaki tables, and sushi I have found in Green Valley. Prices are good, staff is friendly, It is much bigger inside than it looks from the outside. I will be going back alot. One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"I order from here often. Deliveries are always fast and on time, food is always fresh, and GREAT lunch specials."}
{"text":"This place is my go to sushi restaurant. The sushi is great and fresh and I absolutely leave their hot green tea; I get it with every meal. The staff is really friendly and attentive. I recommend this place to anyone looking for some good sushi!"}
{"text":"Fish quality is okay. Rolls are oversauced... Average Americanized sushi/ rolls"}
{"text":"Always have great service, delicious food and fun ambiance! Theirs menu has great variety and so there is always something different to try. I always get the garlic albacore roll and the green tea mochi ice cream!  Their to go service is just add good as their dine in service and they always get it right!  So happily to have found this place so close to home....We have become regulars!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for a great price!  Came with a group of 10 and we ordered 7 or 8 sushi rolls to share. California and Spicy Tuna rolls were great. The X-Files was also a favorite. Also ordered edamame and General Tso's chicken. The sake listing was quite impressive also.  Definitely recommend! Staff is great and very attentive."}
{"text":"I have to say this is a secret really good sushi spot. I have came here for years with my girlfriend and it's never ever failed. Quite honestly we stopped going (even for fun trying all we can) to other spots because it's just solid always. We don't do the all you can eat so I can't give advice on that but great rolls and flavor as well as quality. We sit at the bar and they have great happy hour specials as well as a hibachi grill and restaurant that serves Japanese and Chinese but never tried either. The decor is plain if your on a date and some crazy stark white lighting so not romantic at all but great food and the bars fun and you have to go."}
{"text":"Spoiled fish.  This place can't decide if it's Chinese or Japanese!  It obviously can't decide if the fish they order is fresh or not. Go elsewhere not here."}
{"text":"Felt rushed in ordering and judged for what I was ordering by the waitress mentioning \"that's a lot of food\". She didn't even ask for anything else then walked away. I was going to order more food. What does it matter how much food I order?   Ps. Stick to the Chinese food. I come here mainly for the crispy pan fried noodles and honey walnut shrimp. Portion sizes are large and great for sharing!"}
{"text":"Anyone who recognizes quality and freshness, would easily recognize Ta Ta's.  The oysters, yellow tail, and sushi are among the best I've ever had anywhere and that's from France to Japan.  Ironically, my boyfriend and I had just had oysters from the Venetian Hotel for lunch before we went to Ta Ta's for dinner; Ta Ta's seafood was much fresher.  Ta Ta's freshness in seafood is comparable to the fresh-caught from San Francisco Bay or fish markets in Vietnam.  How they manage that in the middle of a desert is a mystery to me, but oh a wonderfully delicious one.    Ta Ta's actually serve a Buri Toro steak, which is the buttery-tasting belly of the Yellow Tail (hard to find in restaurants).  They also serve an amazing buttery, melt-in-your-mouth Toro.  Ask for the best cut of toro they offer; be aware that toro is usually expensive, but always worth while if fresh like it is at Ta Ta's.  (By the way, also be aware that most restaurants serve tuna in the form of Maguro, which is actually the side of the tuna and not nearly as delicious.)  The Ta Ta's rolls were surprisingly yummy as well.  Having Japanese heritage, I often dislike most Americanized rolls because most American Japanese restaurants think that mixing too many fresh fish together along with teriyaki sauce and mayo will taste good no matter what... that is a sad misconception.  Often i would take the rolls apart so I can enjoy the flavors of each unfortunately combined fish. I was pleasantly delighted by Ta Ta's roll combinations - the rolls are a wonderful balance of taste.  The flavor of each fish is emphasized by each roll rather than masked -- and when emphasis is not the key, varying fish are joined with others creating complex new flavors that can start from the taste of a crisp, fresh shrimp and end in delighting sweetness.  If one is trying out a Ta Ta's roll, I would suggest trying to put most of the roll in one's mouth to get the full flavor and then chewing slow allowing enjoyment of the complexities.    Overall, Ta Ta's is certainly an incredible restaurant.  The owner Randy prides himself in the quality of food - always a good sign in any restaurant.  The quality itself is among the best and certainly better than many beautiful strip hotel restaurants.   If one is visiting Las Vegas, it would be worth one's while to take a short drive off the strip to enjoy a meal that is easily one of the best one can in Nevada."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The fried rice was made with brown rice( gross) and was super watery. Just looked and tasted cheap and gross"}
{"text":"Come hungry cause your plate is full. We had a great time and the kids really enjoyed the place and the food."}
{"text":"Really deilsh! chinese and japanese foods are both on the menu. We Had 4 at dinner and ordered too much food! I was all really tasty. Do not pass up the chance to dine at TA TA's"}
{"text":"HALF OFF REGULAR SUSHI ROLLS.... ALL THE TIME.  I ordered 5 sushi rolls to go for under $15 (California crunch, philadelphia crunch, Shrimp tempura, etc.). You can't beat that. We ordered in the restaurant and it was done in under 10 minutes.  The rolls weren't that great. The Philadelphia had too much cream cheese and the shrimp tempura had JUST shrimp tempura in it. The California crunch was the best roll we ordered.   The shopping plaza it's in is pretty dead as well as the restaurant itself. If you're looking for good quality sushi or planing on eating something other than the half off rolls, I would reconsider. If you're looking for a quick, cheap dinner Ta Ta Bistro is perfect. It's probably cheaper to eat a couple of rolls here then pick up a burrito or some other fast food."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Went in for lunch - took almost 5 minutes to even get greeted (they weren't even busy) - once seated we had waited almost 10 minutes - we notice that 2 tables that had come in AFTER we did had already been seated & were getting their orders taken. Let the server know when she FINALLY came to our table that we were frustrated with the wait when it was very slow in there. She shrugged her shoulders & rolled her eyes. We will NEVER step foot inside again..."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  Service is poor.  The servers cover all tables together.  3 people will try and take your order.  But then good luck catching them again.  Asked 3 times for a fork.  I finally got up and got my own. They run around and talk to you while not stopping.  They are understaffed. Too bad they are so understaffed and poor service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed the sushi from here but our last visit completely changed our minds about this place.. the customer service has always been half assed but the food was decent and wasn't too expensive either but this time the customer service was absolutely horrible and worse than usual that after getting drinks we decided we didn't want to eat from there anymore. We told the waitress we were gonna head out and she tried to force me to pay for the drink that I hadn't even taken a sip of. I hadn't even touched it at all. I've never felt that uncomfortable at a restaurant before and I can honestly say I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"Took my family for my husband's birthday. It was our first time and I have to say we have found our new sushi place! Great fresh sushi, awesome service, and amazing prices!"}
{"text":"Service/ food no good. Family that sat five minutes after us was waited on first - get Da pass on dat cause they had kids. Got the box bento, wife got the shrimp noodles. Ordered some 50% off sushi-no good (should have gotten the clue-50% OFF!) Miso soup-warm- sistah had her fungah in da bowl when she was carrying it- AUWE!had better sushi at albertsons across the street. Salad dressing awful. Sushi twister has a cheaper bento and the food 10x better."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise.  I thought it might be sketchy based on some of the reviews.  We chose Ta Ta Bistro because some of my family likes sushi and others won't touch it.  We were able to order Chinese dishes as well as some sushi plates.  The service was reasonable and the food made everyone happy.  The Japanese Lasagna was terrific.  The decor and general environment was nicer than I expected as well."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery here because I was at the TownePlace Suites nearby.  Lots of food and the sushi was awesome.  Delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night."}
{"text":"Ta Ta is great although I have not been in awhile because it is not around where I live.   They do teppanyaki style and sushi, so yes, it is a fusion type restaurant. I have only had their sushi though and it has always been fresh and consistent. Never have I had a disappointing roll here.  The staff is great. Management tends to walk the tables and ask how your meal is going and if everything is good.   Can get a little loud if the teppanyaki tables are going and show is happening, but that should be expected in this type of place.   Overall, great sushi place in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"My wife visited Ta Ta Bistro on Thursday, 2/11/2010, and I have been regularly going to Ta Ta Bistro about once or twice a month for about one year now. Normally the food is at least four stars on the Yelp scale during dinner. This time we went to lunch. I should have known when I saw we were the only ones dining (besides the employees), that maybe we should have come back later. But alas hunger prevailed.   We stayed for what we thought should have been the same quality we normally experience when we visit Ta Ta Bistro. No. Our waiter never smiled, not once! I felt like we were bothering him from the moment we sat down. Strike one.   We ordered appetizers, the snow crab tempura. Now, my wife normally orders the same thing over and over so as not to be disappointed. I of course asked her to try something new, and she did reluctantly (I'm sooooo sorry honey). The so called snow crab tempura was not at all as it seemed from the menu description.   As a loyal Ta Ta Bistro fan I must admit to being thoroughly disappointed. The menu described succulent SNOW CRAB LEGS battered in tempura and it was to be served with lemon and butter. I asked the non-smiling waiter, \"How is the snow crab tempura\"? and he said \"You know everything is always good\" (hmmm.that should have been a clue). When they came out to the table.... (tears from reliving the moment). It was none other than Imitation \"Krab\" with a K from the grocery store deli!!! You know the stuff you normally serve cold or put in \"Krab\"  with a K salad?   I asked the non-smiling waiter what was the deal with this. I said \"this is not crab meat this is Imitation Krab with a K\", to which he said, \"We use imitation crab in ours\". Strike 2!! I told him the menu describes \"SNOW CRAB LEGS\"! not imitation anything. When he saw how upset we were, no apology was given he just said I take that for you, and carried off my plate of fake KRAB with a K made of Pollock not crab.   Now I was worried because we had not received our Japanese lunch box with \"Rib-eye steak\". Rib-eye is my favorite steak. He did not serve me rib-eye. It was that cheaper cut of meat used for pepper steak. Strike 3!!! And of course it was pre-sliced and drenched in terriyaki so who's gonna argue with that it's rib-eye. I know the texture of Rib-eye. It is not a gelatinous tendon filled meat ever.   Needless to say I am very disappointed in Ta Ta Bistro. Very, very, very, disappointed. It raises the question if the SNOW CRAB LEGS & THE RIB-EYE STEAK were imitation what else is imitation? I hope they get it together soon.   Please keep in mind I normally call over the manager when things go good or really good. And I would have called over the manager for this incident but the non-smiling waiter was keeping him informed the whole time, so there was no need. Needless to say it will be a while before we have the stomach or nerve to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! We go there anytime we have someone in town visiting. We recently went there & sat at the teppenyaki table. They had a new guy cooking the food up for us & he was hilarious! I've never had a bad meal there. The tuna collar, sushi, tonkatsu, and everything else is delish! Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the service can be slow even when they are not busy."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place rated at least 4 stars for a long, long time.  My family and I loved going here for the great sushi and friendly service.  The last two times though we couldn't help but notice that the place has become dirty.  There was dust piled up at least a quarter inch thick on several of the areas around the tables, the walls had flecks of dried food stains, the plates were dirty, and on both visits the bathrooms were DEPLORABLE.  This went from being one of our favorite spots to a place we don't go to anymore.  Clean it up, Ta Ta, and we will give you another shot!  Ta Ta you fixed it!  Cleaned up and came correct!  We have been back and appreciate the improvements!"}
{"text":"The food never disappoints and they offer gluten free soy sauce. There sushi bar is great very attentive and have never steered us wrong when asking for a recommendation. The service on the restaurant side can be a little wanky, but they are all nice"}
{"text":"Great take out or eat in.  No matter what you decide their quality and quantity is excellent. We usually call ahead for Wonton soup, combination fried rice, and Dan-Dan noodles.  Generous portions, piping hot, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience, i give them my order and very specifically because i am a picky eater. They started making my food and they messed up my order. I immediately brought it to the chef's attention. His response was \"oh it was already mixed in sorry\" so i asked \"can i please get what i originally asked for\" his response was \"sorry already mixed in\" again.. then he started arguing with me. I brought management out and they made me a new one. When it was complete the chef slammed the plate of food in front of me full of attitude.. then the server comes to me and says \"next time tell him before he starts making the food\", which i did before hand anyways. So the server starts arguing with me.  After both of them arguing with me because i finally had enough.  I got up, asked for the manager, tried paying for my drinks and walked out.  I have never had this bad of service in my life. I go to hibachi grills nearly once a week and this was by far the worst experience.  I strongly recommend others to stay clear from this place... sorry for the rant, just cant believe how bad my experience was there.."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant due to reviews at AA.com it spoke about food quality and amounts. I went there with a party of 7 and ordered 3 diff tappanyaki dishes & 4 diff types of sushi. First the sushi was basic in quality, the tappanyaki was like most- entertainment & little food. The chef was entertaining but the food was not. I would only go back due to the 40% discount. I disagree with the food quantity , all I can say it was not a great amount. Do not go there with any great expectations it is basic food and quality."}
{"text":"Place is small, so we decide to do Take Out.  Food was quite good, counter staff was disorganized, but they were busy at the time.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place more times than I can count but never thought about stopping until today. Checked out the yelp reviews and decided to give it a try and we were quite pleased. The Chinese food definitely hit the spot. Can't wait to try the sushi."}
{"text":"Love it, the sushi is amazing. I have never been disappointed.  The prices are amazing a lot cheaper then buying all you can eat. Two people eating 4 rolls is good enough for me. My check is never bigger then 20 and that includes 2 drinks. The spider roll is my favorite. The wait is never long, I'm usually seated right when I walk in. Over all it's amazing."}
{"text":"I swear I had written a review for this place, but it seems I'm wrong.  Anyway, I've come here about 3-4 times in the past 2 years. The food's always been amazing, and until recently they had 50% off rolls and 50% off sake. Now it's 40%.   The food is good, the server remembered us from a year ago, and asked how we had been. They treated our guests very kindly, and made good recommendations off the menu when we ordered our second wave of food.   We will definitely be going back. 4 people having drinks and sushi and a bill of only $71? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Orange peel chicken and combination chow mein. I'm happy the meats are fresh tasting unlike like most Chinese places"}
{"text":"When your in a hurry for lunch and your food is very good... You pay the check, leave a 50% tip and you get a TA TA chase out the door.  They think you ate and ran! How embarrassing for me and them to treat a customer like they ran out on the BILL! OMG!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. Fast and friendly service. I always come here for when I crave sushi very reasonably priced.  I love all their rolls, and that all the regular rolls are always half off.  I love the green monster and TNT roll the best."}
{"text":"This place is good and clean. When I use to work close my coworkers and I always got take out sushi.  The sushi was great...two of my favorite rolls are exclusively here.  I can't remember the name now but it has shrimp inside then topped with a load of chopped tuna, salmon, and white fish drizzle in a sauce..SOOOO GOOD.. its not all you can eat which can pretty expensive so I havent been coming as often, however they do have half price on you basic rolls.  They also have half price off the teppanyaki. Brought my two daughter for teppanyaki and i only spent about $25 and the food and show on the grill was good too."}
{"text":"Price are good. The portions are awesome specially if you hace a family. sushi is quite good. The service was awesome.  Will surely come back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for middle of the road everything -quality, pricing and service, then you might enjoy this place.  IMO, mediocre at best and much room for improvement with customer service.   In a city with so much competition, I would drive an extra 5 min to find the next Asian diner."}
{"text":"Veggie tempura was really good.  Then again, i have never had tempura I didnt like.  Tempura veggie roll was meh. Not awful...but a plain veggie roll from smiths is better.  Fried oysters were good for the value...but overdone and the batter was weird, like a coconut shrimp batter almost.  And they dont provide tartar or cocktail sauce, for those that care.  I left with a full belly and a not too upset wallet.  But I won't return, simply because there are much better sushi joints in vegas"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas, but last time I ate there, it gave me the runs."}
{"text":"I have come here several times with guests and it is not bad. I recommend you to come here too. I is not bad, not special, but decent...  1.  Service - Hmm... I think that they treat some regulars really great and the general public, like well, the general public. If you do not expect alot,  you will not be disappointed.  2.  Sushi - Okay, nothing to write home about. Edible and certainly not bad tasting.  3.  Hibachi Grill - Pretty good, nice choices, allowed to split plates which is great for kids.  4.  Kids - Hibachi grill is fun for them and the a la carte ordering that is allowed helps to share with the kids and enjoy a decent show.  5.  Overall - Kinda like ordering a 0.69 cent Hamburger at McDonald in terms of taste, quality and presentation. Edible, not a negative taste, you just would not go out of your way that is all.  Not a bad place and close by to experiment and have fun with the kids."}
{"text":"This place can't decide if it wants to be a Chinese or Japanese restaurant. In the end, it comes off as a compromise at best on both fronts.   This is one of the many restaurants I was dragged to by my family because my dad has always loved Hibachi-table restaurants. Sadly ,it definitely falls at the lesser end of the spectrum.   The Hibachi experience is the same as other restaurants, and this one pulls it off to a lesser extent. The food here, to put it simply, isn't really anything worth writing home about. The staff seem to lack the personality of those from other Asian restaurants around town. I am also disappointed to see that they put peas in their fried rise, but again, that's a matter of taste.  Eating at the normal dining tables isn't any better. This place tries to be a jack of all trades, Chinese and Japanese alike, but is a master of none. I have tried a wide variety of items on the menu, and none of them really jump out at me. The last time I was there I had an orange chicken dish, and it lacked flavor and was difficult to chew. However, most of the soups I have tried are good.   If you want Chinese food, go to Grand China. If you want Japanese food, go to Geisha House. This place is a red-headed step-child of an Asian restaurant that can't decide which way it wants to go."}
{"text":"I live within 1 mile of the place. I get delivery. They are fast - Jimmy John's Fast. Please support them!!! If you live within 1 mile - FAST delivery. I don't think they do much delivery which is probably why it is SOO fast...and I may be screwing myself by publishing this review...but hey...the REALLY earned it."}
{"text":"This place has great prices, above average service for a sushi restaurant. And the rolls are some of the better testing I've had. Highly reccomend"}
{"text":"During my last week in Las Vegas, a good friend and I decided on this place as a meet up for dinner. It was going to be a long and enjoyable night, full of laughs, tears and love. I wanted to go to a place that could accommodate that. Ta Ta seemed like the right spot.  This spot has been here for a long time. I've been to other restaurants in the mall, such as Mi Peru, so I knew where this place was. Once you walk in, you'll notice the sushi bar in front and a huge dining area on the right. In the dining area, they have a Teppan table top for Benihana type Teppanyaki. They also have a lot of booth and table top seating. The staff was a little quiet but checked on us regularly. Here's what we got for dinner:  We started with the V4 Bonzai Roll forr $9.50. This roll was was a shrimp tempura roll with spicy salmon on the top. What a great start! The shrimp tempura was crunch and flavorful, the raw salmon brought a fresh element and wasn't spicy at all. Thank goodness they had wasabi. It was overall a great rool.   Along the same theme, I went with the J4 Combo Box with chicken cutlet for $15.95. The gravy came on the side so I asked for a side of katsu sauce instead. This combo box came with rice, miso soup, salad, shrimp and vegetable tempura, an 8 pc California roll and of course the meat. What a great deal! I loved the variety of this dish. so much to choose from and so many textures. Everything was cooked wonderfully and super flavorful.  Remember when you visit (and you should), the menu is initially overwhelming. There are Chinese and Japanese options available. The food is good though and the service is awesome. If you're in the Stephanie/215 area, come check them out!"}
{"text":"I'm in the same boat as Mark W.  I have eaten here a few times.  The service has always been excellent.  If you like a beer darker than Budweiser, you are out of luck. No ambers, porters, etc...  The sushi here is good, the rest of the dishes, are at the level of Panda Express.  Stick with sushi and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I wouldn't particularly come back by choice. Sat at the sushi bar and ordered maybe 8 rolls or so to try with my date, and all of them were bland and had no flavor of fish just of the rice. Even got some sushi that wasn't made right according to the description when we asked the chef about it he responded that's how we make it now. Wish I would have known that, I could have ordered something else. The sign outside said 50% of sushi which should have been my first indication that it wouldn't be good. When we got the bill there was no discounted sushi. Oh well. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Ta Ta is our go to spot for sushi in this part of town. Really great rolls. Sit at the sushi bar and enjoy the specialty rolls...yum!!"}
{"text":"Good food... clean restaurant and friendly staff. They have decent prices on some of there regular rolls great place to try some different sushi rolls would definitely come back.."}
{"text":"We order take out from here all the time. The sushi is always great and inexpensive!!!"}
{"text":"Within an hour after eating their sushi, i was so so sick. Awful fish.. Dont let the good price fool you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the sushi here! It's amazing. Best I've ever had. The reason for the 3 stars is because the service leaves a lot to be desired. Even when it's not busy, just to get a waiters attention for a drink refill is extremely difficult. Only reason I come here is for the amazing sushi"}
{"text":"The teppan guy was awesome but the rest of the staff was downright rude! The staff had the audacity to charge us the 18% gratuity on our party of 5 eating guests and 2 infants!!!  Their policy is to charge 18% on 6 or more guests, but we were 5. When we told the waitress to take the 18% off the bill her reply was \"they arent people? Do they have hands? We count everyone with hands\". EXCUSE ME?? We had a 3 month old and a 6 month old with us... I  cant believe they truly believe an infant counts as paying a customer! I will tell everyone to stay away from this place! If i would have had cash I would have paid only the food portion and told them to go to hell on getting a tip."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times. The usual place to go when we crave sushi without wanting to pay and eat AYCE sushi.  Regular rolls 50% off: 5-8 piece for cut roll 1. California, 2.75 2. Nevada, 3.25 3. Philadelphia, 3.25  4. Salmon skin hand roll, 2.75 5. Shrimp tempura, 3.00 6. Spicy Salmon, 2.75  They do have a Chinese and Japanese lunch special that is served daily from 11-4pm Chinese  - served with hot & sour soup or egg flower soup, egg roll, rice  Ranges from 6.50 to 7.25 (shrimp)   Japanese  - served with miso soup, cabbage salad, steamed white or brown rice Ranges from 7.50 (Teriyaki special) to 12.95 (Sushi special)  - Quick service.  - Sushi here is nothing spectacular, but satisfies a craving. - Get the Crispy noodle! Although 14.95, a small price to pay for a reminiscent taste of Asian cuisine in the 626!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  This place is high on my dinner rotation!  Everything I've ever had has been delicious. They have hibachi if you ever get in the mood for that.  They have half off regular rolls if you're into sushi (I'm not) and my sushi-loving friends rave about the awesome selection.   The prices are pretty good and I actually pass up Grand China, which is much closer to me, to come here when I'm in the mood for Chinese.  The service is just good.  Not great.  But my food never takes long and the servers are always accommodating.    I like the ambiance - very welcoming and comfortable dining room and it's much nicer on the inside than it seems like it would be from the outside.  TaTa is such a strong option for great food, wide variety, good prices and decent service.  I'm so going to miss this place when I move across town!"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki is fresh & excellent quality & priced well. Service is pretty slow otherwise & almost no accommodations made on order. I bit Difficult to get reservations for teppanyaki so you need to be flexible if you want to go.   Food good & service average."}
{"text":"I love Ta Ta! I've never ate anything here that I did not like. They had some new special rolls last time I went.  I had the Xfiles roll it was sooooooo yummy! The staff here is super friendly and the prices are great. The sushi is always fresh and tastes great. I think I am addicted to Ta Ta. I get cravings for it quite often."}
{"text":"i come here often just for a sushi fix. they have an on-going half off regular sushi rolls promo which hasn't ceased since march 2013. (i don't know when they will end it either)  so i'm a cheap person when it comes to spending money on anything. my favorite roll is a philadelphia roll deep fried. so at regular price for eight pieces it is $7.50. but here at tatas i can get this for $3.25 instead, which is a major plus in my book.   i have yet to try the hibachi, but maybe someday because it is half priced as well.   one day i did try their teriyaki chicken lunch. the chicken was drenched in sauce, the tempura vegetables are nothing special, but good, same goes for the california rolls it comes with.   overall, if you are cheap like me and don't mind just regular rolls this is the place for it."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. We always have a great time here.  The price is right.  You can't beat half off teppanyaki.  The service is good. Being Chinese server.  The teppanyaki chef is very friendly and good.   Try them.  I like it being picky as I am!!  ;)"}
{"text":"I love tatas, it one of the best places for sushi and Japanese food in henderson. We've been going for years and the food is great, the service is wonderful and the pricing is more than fair. Highly recommend,  a must go."}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch here due to being in a hurry. We were the only ones in here.  The teriyaki chicken was like rubber and grisly.  I couldn't eat one bite.  It was disgusting. The tempura was ok but it's hard to screw that up.  I have been here a few times and no one ever seems to be happy to be working here.  The place needs a make over.  The seats are cracking so they are uncomfortable on your legs.  It's dirty. We have given this place too many chances. I paid my bill, didn't complain and left.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Love going here for sushi when I go see my friends in Henderson. The sushi is very good and surprisingly cheap than most places you go to sushi for."}
{"text":"Tucked in a strip plaza, this place was very good. They offer very reasonable lunch specials. Service was good and food was served quickly. Overall a good value for tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Was avoiding this place for a while because their product offering is way too diverse, but my roommates and I decided to give it a go.   Menu is rather large so we decided to go family style. We ordered the Sizzling Triple Sensation (crispy noodles with beef, chicken and shrimp), the Mongolian Beef, and a couple sushi rolls that are 50% off.   Food was surprisingly good! But what was even better were the huge portions. Those two plates and sushi rolls left 4 grown men stuffed, and more! We didn't even finish everything. The noodles were cooked well and even though the sushi was deepfried, it was still tasty. The meat could have been cooked better, though.   But with a price tag of $10 a head including tip, it's good value for decent food! I'll be back for a cheap, easy dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my son, as he wanted a roll only Ta Ta offers. After an inward groan, we stopped in for a quick lunch. The carpets were clean and so were the tables. The menus were clean this time, and the place was nearly empty.   We ordered our rolls (you can't beat 50% off regular rolls) and they came out promptly. I made sure to check for issues but found none. The rolls were good this time, and my son enjoyed them too.  For $14 for four rolls, it was ok. An increase to 3 stars for a good job cleaning the place after my last visit."}
{"text":"I always frequent Ta-Ta's Bistro. They provide such value and the sushi is excellent. I've been to places that charge more for similar servings. I've only had the sushi there, but I've also been there for lunch with co-workers and they rave about the Chinese dishes that they serve as well. Lastly, who can't like 2 for 1 sake?  I am definitely a fan of this place. My co-workers and I call in our orders every other Thursday. We are definitely regulars there."}
{"text":"Normally we go to Gehisha House but decided to try something different since we were in that area. The food was good but the customer service was lacking. They were just blah. Lastly, it needed some cleaning. We noticed a bunch of dust on the vents and the hoods needed a deep cleaning."}
{"text":"I went to go have lunch with a friend last week he wanted teriyaki. I really didn't care he took me here and as we were walking up I thought \"ekkk this better be good.... i wish he told me where we were going before so I could yelp this place.\"  Needles to say it didn't look like much outside, nor did it inside the seats has cuts and table was sticky. We were seated right away which was nice because we didn't have much time.   I didn't look at all the menu just the lunch specials they were pretty cheap and my friend said that's all he ever got.  I got the Mongolian Beef lunch special which came with rice, egg roll, and hot and sour soup.   Our beverages and soup came out like lightning! I really didn't get a chance to taste the soup it was so hot it burned my mouth and by the time our food came I was already full so I skipped it.   The Mongolian Beef was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! It was the BEST Mongolian beef I ever had....like EVER!!! The sauce was so flavorful I'm drooling right now just thinking about it. The portions were huge I couldn't finish mine and BELIEVE me I tried!   The food was outstanding it made me forget about the torn seat and sticky table! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I usually come during lunchtime and have their lunch special. Their lunch special comes with a choice of soup, either white or brown rice, an eggroll (with meat in it!!) and an item of your choosing. I usually get the garlic chicken or beef and broccoli. The serving size is huge for lunch and I always have leftovers to take with me. Service is very quick and prices are good. Most of the lunch special items are about $6.50. This will definitely be a weekly spot for my friends and I. They also have sushi here, which I hear is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Place is dirty. Carpet appears to have not been cleaned in years. Dust is everywhere. The front of the building is disgusting. Filthy fingerprints all over the windows. Found a hair in my food on my last visit. If this is how they maintain the areas I can see, how bad is the areas I can't see?"}
{"text":"My oh my... just thinking about Ta Ta's makes my mouth water!!  I have definitely found my new favorite restaurant. I have ate at many teppanyaki style restaurants and this one tops my list. The hibachi chefs are hilarious, the wait staff attentive and you just can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. Right now all regular sushi rolls and teppanyaki entrees are 40% off!! WOW!! Tender, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon for under $15... yes please :)   Tip: make a reservation before you go. With only two teppan tables they of course fill up fast! Other seating options- you have a full service sushi bar and the regular restaurant tables."}
{"text":"Once you get past the floors and dated interior you're in for a nice meal! I can only rate the grill which is great no matter what you order! Pricing is half off and the meat is flavorful and good quality! The restaurant could use an overhaul inside but I guess they figure if it ain't broke don't fix it! This place is always busy regardless."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time tonight. As the other helpers have said \"Yes, the menus are sticky and the place could use a good cleaning\". It's not a dump but it appears a little neglected. (That's why I subtracted 1 star)  However, I will say that the food was good and we got a ton of it for the price. The service was super fast. We ordered several sushi rolls and appetizers and they were delivered within minutes.  Overall, a great place to try. Great value and I will return."}
{"text":"50% off regular rolls! And they're actually good! I would give it five stars, but sometimes the servers can be too attentive or just ignore you. I have sushi at least once a week with my friend Hannah and nothing to disappoint yet! Also try the fried banana ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Asian food in town! The tepanaki grill is half price right now! If you like Asian cuisine this is a must try!"}
{"text":"I lalalooooove this place.  My family has gone here for over years now. We've been regulars for as long as I can remember! We always celebrate my dad's birthday here, other occasions as well. This place has two big party rooms so that's why we also keep this place in mind.  Their food is delicious! Very authentic tasting. Orange peel chicken is super yummy and the honey walnut shrimp is so creamy. Their beef and broccoli is very tasty and most of their food is large portions so you can share with the whole party! It's pretty awesome here. They also have smaller lunch and dinner specials which are definitely worth it. They serve sushi and my all-time favorite would be the baked lasagna--SO soooo good.  If you're ever in the area, do not hesitate to try this place! They also have wonderful ice cream and mochi for dessert.  Will always be a nostalgic place for me, will it be for you?"}
{"text":"I have been putting off trying this place with all of the mixed reviews. However after a few of my neighbors and friends told me it was a great place for lunch I gave it a try. Oh, I wish I wouldn't have.   As other reviews have mentioned it was dirty inside and just not appealing. I may have been looking more than usual since many reviews mentioned it was dirty, but we did notice dirty air vents, dirty carpet and dusty ledges near the tables.   We ordered the tempura lunch and the teriyaki chicken. Both were terrible. It came with miso soup which I did not care for. The tempura was very thick and the rice was just dry (I know it's supposed to be  its hard  to explain), almost like it was sitting out for a long time. It also came with some small salad drenched in a mayonnaise sauce.  The service was actually okay, but it was not very busy. This was really bad Japanese food and will we will not be returning. There are many better choices for Chinese or Japanese food in e area."}
{"text":"A very inexpensive place, but the food is tremendous. If you are a sushi lover and you don't like to spend a lot of money I definitely recommend Ta Ta. The sushi chefs were also very nice. They made conversation and were extremely friendly. They also made sure that I was satisfied and asked me if I needed anything additional. A very great place all-around for such a low price!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was a little leery when I heard that they had a Japanese sushi bar inside of a Chinese restaurant. I do have to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. All of the sushi rolls and sake are 50% off. Though this Sushi isn't the best that I've ever had in my life, the price makes it well worth the trip. The staff was friendly the service was fast and the food was good. I would recommend this place to my friends. I'm looking forward to my next trip there."}
