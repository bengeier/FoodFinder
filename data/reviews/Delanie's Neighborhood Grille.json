{"text":"Great food! Today we started with the homemade chips and a few beers. Then I got the Flat Iron Steak and my wife got the Veggie Quesadilla. Service was quick and friendly. We have been here many times, always packed but never have to wait for food and drinks. Very nice place to hang out and watch a game or just relax and drink a few with friends."}
{"text":"We went there for St. Patrick's Day.  Atmosphere was festive and the food was good.  We weren't rushed to finish and leave,  and had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. I've been here multiple times with no disappointments. They also have a great selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"The server was really nice and very prompt but that's the only good thing I have to say. I asked for a med rare burger and the server very happily said, \"sure\" but when it came out it was not med rare. It was a perfectly shaped, frozen patty. Ick. The fries were ok but definitely frozen as well. I expect a freshly made burger for almost $9. It was my first time here and I won't come back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. I got chicken quesadillas that were burnt and tasted funny. My stomach started to hurt before I even left the building. My friends that went with me also got sick and didn't like there food either. We got spin dip which I'm not sure were to start with that, other than a warning don't get the spin dip."}
{"text":"We had a surprise birthday party for my parents here and everything was wonderful!  Rana was incredibly helpful in determining how much food we would need and what types of items would work best with our guests.  On the day of the event  everyone that was working was professional and friendly and our food was set up exactly as planned.  Wonderful customer service and yummy food.  I would definitely recommend Delanies!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning approximately 11am. First thing I liked was not having to wait in line for breakfast on Sunday morning which is common at most breakfast places. Staff was friendly and attentive. I had the corned beef hash which was very good and the french toast was good as well. Prices were very reasonable and I would definitely visit again for breakfast or to try their lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"Let me first mention that I'm slightly biased because my girlfriend works at Delanies, but upon walking in the first time to visit her, I knew that I'd really like this restaurant. It's got a great atmosphere to sit down, throw back a few beers and eat some decent bar food. In a way, it reminds me of of the bar on Cheers. They've always got the jukebox playing a wide myriad of songs that generally pleases everyone, and it's not too loud as to make you yell to talk to the person next to you either. If you're going there looking for 5-star food, don't bother. The food is your typical bar food (wraps, burgers, salads, etc), but most of it is actually very good! My personal favorites are the hummus and veggies, chips and dip (ask for the samara sauce as well you won't be disappointed), cheesburger wrap and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The beer prices are really cheap ($2-$4) and the food prices are reasonable ($7-$10). Service has always been great every time, servers come around frequently and are attentive. If you're looking for a place to go and get some fairly priced, good food in a great atmosphere, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Close to home. good food and beer. Great staff. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I definitely was not impressed... great atmosphere but the food was not so great. I got a steak salad. It was enormous but did not have any taste. The steak was so awful! you could tell it was very cheap and poorly cooked. the salad barely had any vegetables. the dressing were definitely homemade and were watered down. I was hoping for a better meal. Deep fried pierogies were very good tho. I will definitely give it another shot.. i like to give a restaurant a chance to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I patronize local restaurants several times a month. This restaurant has a great diverse menu and great vibe.  My burger was amazing with gouda cheese on it and my server Taylor was very knowledgeable. There are a few tv's throughout so i could catch some of the game.  I told my server i was stuffed and didn't leave room for dessert. She brought me a homemade dessert on the house because she said \"I deserved it. \" I will definitely be back if im ever in the area. Great service and Great Food."}
{"text":"I love Delanie's!   It's a great community-oriented, local gem.  Food is good, and the prices are great... from breakfast to dinner to drinks.   My organization has held a number of working meals at Delanie's, and the staff has been terrific in making us feel at home.  In addition to the good food and people, the folks who run this place also do their part to support great community initiatives.  When you spend your cash here, you get a great meal, a great experience, and you know that the owners/managers share some of their profits in the community.   I moved away several years ago, but I'll always head to Delanie's when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"The food is average.   We ordered hummus and pita, it was homemade and tasty, has a hint of a kick.    I had the San Antonio salad it was pretty good, the dressing which is creamy salsa sort of concoction I did not care for at all. Hubby had a steak sandwich that he said was ok.   Prices were fair atmosphere seemed typical neighborhood place.   The staff is very young(inexperienced).  There seemed to be about 20 girls running around, and our service was chaotic.  We had ordered iced tea, diet coke 2 kids waters.   Never got the iced tea.   The food came out exceptionally slow, and not all at once.  I didn't have high expectations so this seems about right for a place like this.    I'd prob go back as long as not in a rush.     Seems the server staff needs a leader to teach them all the ropes."}
{"text":"Had this been the old menu with old prices and old service I may have given 4 or 5 stars but this new menu is not stellar and neither was the service in terms of wait.  We ordered what honestly were overpriced sandwiches for the portion and it took almost 45 minutes to get our food! Others around us were being served having sat down after we did. Don't know why you changed the menu but it is not a good change for your customers. If you are going to make them wait that long for their food, at least make it affordable. Also, need to have ONE station playing music in your dining area, not two. That was incredibly annoying to be seated closed to the door and forced to listen to two different songs at a time"}
{"text":"Great place.  I've had the Classic Reuben sandwich and the Olde Town Steak Sammich.   Hands down the best Reuben I've had in years, and the Steak Sammich was excellent as well.  Waitresses have been great, the staff friendly, and they usually have some interesting desserts. Fantastic.  Go visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving around looking for a place to eat.  We stopped in here to our good fortune.  I cannot say anything negative.  It was a bit cold in there and the waitress helped us fix that.  Michelle was our waitress.  She was caring and considerate.  She knew her stuff and had a good personality. She helped us figure out the menu.  I had special requests on my meal and the kitchen handled it for me.  I ordered the flat iron steak.  I do not like seasoning on my steak, because places usually salt it.  The cook came up with the alternative up roasted garlic and pepper without using the salt.  Very good.   We can go on and on.  Great experience.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Delanie's and we were pleasantly surprised.  Good food, good service, and nice atmosphere.  We had the salmon burger and a hamburg and both were cooked just right.  The fries were good both seasoned and unseasoned.  Our waitress was new but you'd never know.  She was a real pro.  Our meal with a glass of wine and a beer cost just under $30.  That's pretty inexpensive.  We'll go back!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the staff is friendly, but that's Ohio for you.  Coming from Colorado, I'm still pleasantly surprised how nice everyone is here, especially in the service industry. The cocktails are good/not weak. They could work on the the rueben.  The meat is cut way too thick, tough to chew through and not enough sauerkraut.  A few of the other items could use a spruce up too.  There isn't enough attention to the food part!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat.  The burgers are juicy and flavorful.  The fries are crispy.  The salads are awesome!  You have to order the hummus.  I don't think I've had a bad thing on their menu.  The service is always friendly.  The best part is that it's owned by a Tallmadge family so you're not giving your money to a corporate chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Delanie's always has a nice selection of fresh homemade soups.  The Lobster Bisque is really good and Clam Chowder is also delicious.  Another one of my favorites that they don't make very often is Corn Chowder.  They have a wide variety of menu items.  The coconut shrimp basket and seasoned french fries are really good and so is their gyro which also comes with fries.  I've had a greek salad here which is very good and you can add gyro meat if you want.  They have burgers and sandwiches and are also open for breakfast.  The service is always fast and friendly and there is never a line to get seated.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I remember this place when it was Sperry's. I've been here several times as Delanie, but not for a long time. We were here on Monday to celebrate the life of a family member and frequent diner. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. Much better than I remembered. The staff was very attentive and kind. We had a good sized group of people but the gals who took care of us kept us all with plenty of coffee and made sure everything was the best. As I said the food was excellent, there not a one of us that could say anything bad about it, or the service. Thanks Delanie's."}
{"text":"Love Delanie's !!! Friendly from start to finish. I even won Brown's tickets in a raffle there."}
{"text":"If this bar was near home, I would visit frequently. I immediately noticed that is was a very clean, friendly, neighborhood atmosphere. My GF ordered the Southwest wrap which she was happy with, but wished that it would have contained corn and/or avocado. I also have to mention these are her absolute favorite fries! As a first timer, I ordered a gyro with coleslaw. It was ok. The flavors of everything tasted really good, but for me my gyro meat was overcooked. The only negative about our whole experience was the unruly customer at the bar that was very loud and highly intoxicated, and upon leaving referred to me  as everything except white. However, I can not put blame on the establishment bc I do not know the whole situation. Great portions, great prices, tasty food, and friendly/attentive service! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The veggie quesadilla was pretty good; it had a nice variety of vegetables. My friend was disappointed with the pasta primavara. They were generous with the vegetables, but there didn't seem to be any sort of sauce or binding - just vegetables and wet noodles. Prices were good - about $10 per person. We'll probably go again and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Comfy neighborhood bar. Friendly bartenders, Stephanie is our favorite! Bar food is average."}
{"text":"Definitely a local staple! I live in Chicago now but whenever I'm back in Tallmadge I definitely always stop at Delanies. The food is always great and the service always fast and friendly. I almost always go for the salmon ceasar but their burgers and fries are good too. Try the Sammy, it has velveeta cheese and special sauce Mmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"From start to finish a great experience. Our bartender was awesome and food was amazing. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"awesome food and there craft beer is so good...  Also the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wide selection.  Staff is (very) young and friendly, food is good, nothing \"amazing,\" but always good.  Definitely a Tallmadge local favorite."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the steak and eggs at brunch.  Unless you like not-steak flavored bubble gum."}
{"text":"I love their lobster bisque and their hummus with veggies. It's nice to see this type of stuff on a regular neighborhood bar menu. The grape leaves and tabouli are great too."}
{"text":"Good food and good service at a reasonable price.  Lobster Bisque Soup is delicious. Nice hometown feel."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorites!!! Very local feel. The service is close to unbeatable. The girls are cute that work there and the food is catch you off guard amazing. Everytime I go there Im immediately greeted and they are on top of all my needs. Once again I would highly recommend to get in here and check these guys out."}
