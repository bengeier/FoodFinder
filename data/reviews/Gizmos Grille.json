{"text":"This little gem of a restaurant is in a tiny little building on Norwalk Rd.  You'd never think there was so much character and such good food from the size of the place!  It has become busy just from word of mouth about the great food and service.  It is a real homey atmosphere.  I have my horses boarded close by so I often stop in here for lunch or dinner.  I will have to make it for breakfast sometime!   Everything I have tried has been wonderful and the prices are good too.  The cheese quesadillas and the onion petals are a real favorite.  They have special dinners everyday that they post out on a sign by the road like Perch and Perogies or Chicken Paprikash, Reuben Sandwiches, Beef Pot Roast. etc.  In April or May they will start to carry their soft serve ice cream.  Mmmm.  And before you fill up too much, look at the deserts in the case as you come in.  I can personally give and A+ for the brownies!!"}
