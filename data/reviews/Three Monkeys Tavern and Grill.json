{"text":"We love this place.... Food is amazing, (especially the wings), great beer prices, and excellent customer service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice local, hole in the wall, did I mention local? Watering hole.  Food wasn't bad either for a watering hole.  If your not a local you might feel out of place.  Everyone there seems to know each other's ie friends and neighbors"}
{"text":"Been going to 3 monkeys for about 2 years now, started going just for drinks and fun but loved their food and the prices so go all the time now. If your looking for fancy or different kinds of food to try, this isn't the place, it's more just your typical bar food but  I've never been unhappy with the food."}
{"text":"I have to say people need to stop thinking they are food critics when they don't know the differance between good and bad McDonald's.  The biggest problem with this place is people think it says bar and grill when it says tavern. Best bar food I have ever had. Great prices and not a thing is frozen.  Look in there kitchen 3 fridges and that's it. Hard to freeze food in a fridge. I personally like that I have people stopping to ask if I need anything about every 10 mintues. Never an empty or warm beer! Go in there and get a draft and some of the best wings around for under $10, count me in! Go in on a Friday night if it isn't good why is it packed. Love going in and joking around with the family of this family owned business.  They know how to treat good loyal customers."}
{"text":"Three Monkeys is the place to go for any type of night. The food is great, drinks are cheap with a wide selection, and the service can't be beat. The Monkey gives you the perfect local experience where you feel like a friend, not just a customer. Come in for dinner, the game, or just to meet friends for drinks and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love going to 3 Monkeys.  Nice size burgers with fries ideally priced.  The barbalo style chicken wings are awesome.  Friendly staff very attentive to your needs.  Sorry that our favorite waitstaff is no longer there, but no matter. Great place for friends to gather for a night in town. :)"}
{"text":"45 min for a hot dog, and I cancelled my order and prepared to leave the owner called me a douch for cancelling my order.  Service and food quality had already gone down.  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Great themed local burger joint. If you're in the Harrisburg area make this stop for lunch or early dinner. Lots to look at and a fun burger menu."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a beer or two or to bring the family in for dinner. Friendly staff, good food. Also, I have seen greg w. In this establishment since his review... Douche."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere where everyone knows everybody! The honey medium wings are my go to!"}
{"text":"Worst experience that I've had to date in Charlotte. I am buying a house close by and wanted to check out local bars. Stopped into multiple places everywhere had fantastic service and southern hospitality. I walked into 3 monkeys which was my third stop. The server came up and asked me what I would like. I asked if the beers were local. I named 3 and said that I know those and asked her about 3 others.  She said does it f7cking matter? so miller light. I said no this isn't the bar for me and got up and left. Very dissapointed that the closest bar to my new house has a server this rude. On my way to the flying saucer wish me luck"}
{"text":"I had heard nightmares of waiting forever for food, bad service, etc....when they opened, so I avoided this place like the plague.  One night my husband came home and said his co-workers were all meeting at Three Monkeys and that we were invited.  I hesitated, but went.  What a surprise!  Appetizers are great (fried pickles and fried green beans!!!), Sandwiches and Burgers are BIG!! You get a choice of fries or homemade chips (either are good).  And they have really good specials if you are a beer drinker. All in all, I have been back many times since that first time.  Fun place to meet with friends.  The only complaint I have is their chairs at the bar tables...not very comfortable. But, that's minor in exchange for a fun time."}
{"text":"This place was alright, definitely a bar restaurant though. I had a burger and tater tots. It was good but nothing to write home about. The burger is fairly priced considering it includes toppings. Really it seems like a boxed angus burger from Harris Teeter, not the cheap kind but certainly not what I expected from a place referred to as the place to go for a burger. The service was great, the only time a waitress wasn't stopping by was the odd time after I was asked twice if I was ready and before I was ready, but it could have been just because I was hungry. I would go here again, especially for a quick bite but not because I wanted a great burger. A burger built well with good toppings for a fair price is what I found."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar with the best hamburgers in Harrisburg. The fried pickles rock and great homemade ranch"}
{"text":"love this place!! come here a couple times a week (we live right down the road), but food and service is always great.   wings are my fave :)"}
{"text":"Fried pickles were great , bugers are not bad , fries soggy with grease,,The service was  terrible ,had to find someone twice to get drink refills ,,,probably my last trip !"}
{"text":"Good place for a nice lunch or dinner! Definitely a casual dining experience but the atmosphere is comfortable. It is a little confusing your first time because you have to walk to the back and seat yourself but after that it is smooth sailing! The prices are good and it stays open late so you can go there when everything else is closed. I have always been treated very nicely by the staff and would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite and a drink. A little loud and takes time to get a table. They have good specials and the hamburgers are not bad."}
{"text":"Cute little bar but if you are going for the food go elsewhere. We went with a group after work and the food was mostly frozen. I had a burger and it was dry and flavorless. Nothing outstanding at this place. But if you want a cheap beer and bad bar food this place may be for you."}
{"text":"The service and the value is what sets this place apart from others.  Some of the best wings I've ever had.  They cost about $8 for 12 wings so you can't beat that price unless you make em at home!  The craft beer lover will enjoy a variety of draft beers ranging from Wicked Weed Double IPA to OMB Copper ale and NODA cans like hop drop n roll and Jam Session.  The cost of the beer is also pretty amazing with specials on Wednesday's and Thursday's but the usual price beats any bar I've been to around here. As far as the other food, it's above average for your standard bar fare but again the prices are so reasonable it over delivers in all respects.  Try them out!"}
{"text":"I got a togo order and it was all just okay. I ordered a veggie quesadilla, friend green beans,e  my friend had wings and fries. The green beans were a little soggy where I would prefer them be more crispy. The quesadilla was okay - wish it had more veggies. My friend did however like his food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a year now and it literally only took two trips before one of the waitresses remembered my face and drink! How awesome is that?! I always have really great service here. The girls are so nice and always have a smile on their face. The wings are my favorite. I get medium because the hot is REALLY hot. You can get 6 wings and a side for less than $7. This is my favorite place to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with $1.50 can beer! AND...the fried pickles are the best I've had.  The chicken fingers are just fried from frozen and average.  The hot sauce for the chicken is hot and yummy and makes up for the bland chicken strips. Also a sports bar - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice little bar with just average food. I had the hotdog basket with sweet potato fries.The hotdogs were good but the sweet potato fries were bland and a lil hard/undercooked. I wouldn't say it was a bad meal, just decent."}
{"text":"Great wings. I especially love their garlic parm flavor!! Hot wings are way too hot so we go for med."}
{"text":"Three Monkeys is my absolute favorite bar since I have moved to the Charlotte area. The vibe is very welcoming, the prices are phenomenal, and the food is perfect. For awhile, my friends and I were going at least once a week to get beer and wings. You cannot beat the wing prices - we always get a 24 piece and take home the leftovers. The corn fritters are my favorite appetizer/side and I have to get them every time. I've gotten a couple different wraps and sandwiches and never been disappointed.   The service is great. The employees walk around and will never leave your glass empty. We love the rotating taps and the fact that most of the offerings tend to be local. There is such a good variety, but they always have the basics too. Even without a drink special I think the prices are fair - but with a drink special (like Thursday night draft special) you are getting a steal.   Three Monkeys is my favorite and I make sure to take anyone that wants so wings and a good beer here. Maybe I will see you there"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best wings hands down, and by far the best price. It's around $15 for 24 wings..... you'll never find that anyplace else. The staff is great all of the girls work together to make sure everyone is taken care of!"}
{"text":"I have been here way too many times, and we are over it.  I will say prices are good on both food and drinks, but you get what you pay for.  On two occasions we had large parties (15+) who all are and drank a lot, and we had horrible service.  They acted like w were a bother, when actually we probably spent close to $800 that night in total.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Found the Yelp reviews helpful when deciding where to eat. They have the best Steak Salad, hands down. My family has tried the Chicken Parmigiana sandwich, Chicken Salad and Grilled Chicken Club.  I give the food 5 stars and the price 4 stars, mostly. Their sides are a little on the expensive side, for instance, $3.99 for tater tots in a small bowl and probably contained 12-14. I didn't mind the size however, I did mind the price."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a while, the food is good for bar food. Normally If you get there during busy hours you'll wait to get a menu or even a server. They have about 2-3 server who will rotate around. My biggest pet peeve with this place is it claims to be open until 2 but will normally barely make it to 12. I understand if you are slow and want to close, but you should change the hours accordingly. Which leads me to my next thing. I wanted to go grab some beers with my coworkers (we also work in the restaurant business) it was 12 on the dot and asked if we could get any beers. I told the bartender we wanted some drinks and no food so the kitchen wouldn't have to worry about us. She proclaimed she had already cleaned the bar, while people were sitting all around it and I left for the Fox and hound which will most likely be the new spot for my coworkers and me. I would not have a problem if the demeanor in which it was said was nicer but it was not. I do not make a habit of giving bad reviews but wanted to address some flaws hindering the place, in my opinion. I would love to try this place \"late night\" again."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant with the cheapest craft beer in town! Love their build-your-own burger (no up-charge for toppings). Love coming here to get my hot wing fix and their hot sauce is actually hot! Their homemade potato chips are my downfall."}
{"text":"Good \"bar\" food. The service is good. Our friend had the haddock sandwich special on Friday night. I will be trying that next time."}
{"text":"Leaves me continuing my search for good wings in the Harrisburg area. For the first time ever, I had a feather on my wing... The tenders were frozen rather than fresh. The philly steak has little steak and the ranch dressing was not fresh or even close to fresh. The prices are decent but you sincerely do get what you pay for in this case.  It's a Tavern... And if you drink enough, the food probably isn't that bad but not somewhere I would be compelled to take a guest to if trying to show them the charms of my small town."}
{"text":"This is probably the best price for quality wings I have found. $8 for 12 wings. I am used to paying $15-18 for a dozen wings. So this place is definitely doing the wings right. They were not the best wings I've ever had, but I wasn't expecting them to be. They were quality and flavorful, and for the price, I have nothing but compliments to give.   I ordered to-go and this was probably not the smartest move on my part. I was meeting a few friends next door and just wanted to be in and out here; however, that was not the case. The place was really busy for a Tuesday evening. I was told the wait would be 15 minutes and it was approximately 35-40 minutes before I got the wings.   The bartenders were extremely friendly and apologetic about the wait, so no hard feelings for Three Monkeys. I plan on coming back and dining in next time."}
{"text":"Based on my to go order placed at the bar, the bartender was very nice. She took my order as soon as i sat down. Order 6 wings and a side of fried green beans. Took about 15 minutes. Placed was packed around 7pm. I watched the bartenders pour drinks wow too bad i was not drinking today they pour heavy. Next time i will definitely have a drink made. Warning place is very loud and DARK. Not a good place for kids or large groups or meeting. Its pretty small inside but there is additional seasoning around back, around 10 tables. Their wing prices are the best ive seen in charlotte and surrounding area. Wow great value and great bar food."}
{"text":"I had the burger and onion rings. The rings where excellent. The burger was a bit dry with no real flavor. The grilled onions and mushrooms on it where great. Overall it was ok and for $8 a good deal."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte visiting some friends and we decided to stop in here for lunch one day. Very wise decision!!  We started off with an order of the fried pickles - there were like sliced pickled breaded with something that had just a bit of a kick. Different from other fried pickles I have had but very good.   I had the special of the day - a BBQ sandwich and fries. It was seriously yummy and my mouth was pleased with my choice for sure! I was happily stuffed for hours after this meal!  My friend had a chicken wrap, said it was very good, something she wouldn't hesitate to recommend.   If you are in the area you should stop in and give this place a try - if your luck was like mine you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little stop, but it is a challenge to find if you're looking for the place (and you aren't likely to stumble across them either) - go around back and you're golden.  Once inside, it's a bit hit-or-miss if you'll be helped. Even after visiting, I'm not really sure if you're supposed to seat yourself or wait to be seated, and once you do get a seat, you wait and wait to be helped, and wait again to receive the food you ordered.  If you're interested in good service, sit at the bar: Not exactly the best place to sit at most establishments, but here, it's definitely where you want to be if you want to be helped quickly.  After the food comes out, it's certainly some decent food, and may even be worth the wait, but this really isn't a place you go for food. It's more on the bar side, and maybe order something to eat while you're drinking (and thus, you don't mind waiting). Even paying your tab can seem like it takes a while. Just make sure you have the time and you'll probably be a lot less frustrated."}
{"text":"Well we come out for a guys night out. Juke box song is censored at 9:30. Steak sandwich, where's the steak? Pass."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was sub-par...... There's no reason why there should be 5 different servers checking up on the table to bring food, drink etc..... Also the initial server that took the order should be taking care of the checks not another server that had nothing to do with the ordering......."}
{"text":"Have been back a few *g* more times, but only at lunch or before drive-time (In NYS, that would be called \"happy hour\" but that doesn't seem to exist here). Beer on tap specials, some can specials. Limited selection, but a well thought out one- Guinness, Blue Moon, Sweetwater, Fat Tire, Yeungling and Bud Light. Nothing too artsy, nothing too bourgeoisie; a step up from pedestrian or working class (except the Bud Light!).  Burgers and wings are the backbone of the menu, but the salads and wraps are really good. I am holding out hope for some soups over the winter- dare I? It's a rough-and-tumble Upstate NY kinda sports bar- what we would call the local pub, or bar & grill, or local watering hole back home. If you're jonesing for those Western NY accents, Bills football, and 'weck...this is it!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger and chips. Food was very good but was not happy with the lighting. Too dark in there for my liking. Definitely won't be going in the evening. Like to see what I am eating."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant  for years. I've heard the burgers are very good. Finally had the opportunity to go last night and it was very good. Decent burger. Good service. I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"I've been going to 3 monkeys for about 3 years. Their wings are my favorite, especially the garlic parmesan. I've also tried other items on their menu which was very good as well. The staff is also great. They are always very friendly."}
