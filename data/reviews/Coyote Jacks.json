{"text":"Right in the USA departure terminal.  Quick service and a decent burger place if you want to dine and dash to your flight.

Prices are pretty reasonable and I got a cheeseburger combo which was good.

A note: they can't really break a combo, so if you want to switch the drink in the combo for something else like a beer, you'll have to pay for the drink separate or pay for the burger and fries as individual...a few people had to rush to flight and stood around arguing about this."}
{"text":"4 stars for airport food?  No, I'm not crazy.  The cheeseburger I had at Coyote Jack's was shockingly delicious.  I needed a hangover snack before a flight to Germany, and I stopped here.  Maybe the hangover made this amazing, but I was a happy camper.  The prices were fair for airport food, and my cheeseburger was good.  They were cooking the burgers as ordered so I had a nice fresh burger.

The only thing weird thing was that they would only take cash, and it had to be Canadian dollars.  I was coming from Toronto so I had cash, but if you were coming from out of country and connecting, this is a flaw."}
{"text":"You get twice as many eggs as A&W next door for the same price. It's just breakfast. Sounds like from other reviews if you go for something other than breakfast, you won't be that happy. For breakfast, I was."}
{"text":"Horrible, gummy, nasty burger. Hot, crispy, very food fries. There isn't much choice in this airport, but this and the Molson Pub are both supremely bad."}
