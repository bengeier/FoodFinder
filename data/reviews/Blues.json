{"text":"After trying Black Dog Smoke & Ale House last week, I was eager to try a new BBQ joint. In order to make a fair comparison, I ordered the same thing- a pulled pork sandwich. The sauce itself was ok- a little sweet, but unfortunately I couldn't taste the pork. My sandwich consisted of bun + BBQ sauce with almost NO meat. The sauce was so overwhelming, and the lack of protein so significant that you almost couldn't tell if you were eating pulled pork or brisket. It tasted exactly like my mother-in-law's shredded BBQ beef made in the crock pot...Which is fine, for a crock pot dinner, but if your whole restaurant is BBQ- you should make something better than anyone could make by sticking a pork butt in the crock pot, covering w/ BBQ sauce and walking away for 8 hours. The mac and cheese was also meh- it tasted like Stouffer's frozen with salt and paprika sprinkled on top.  If you want great BBQ, skip Blues and Hickory River, head to Black Dog in Urbana!"}
{"text":"If you have a craving for the Chef Boyardee of BBQ--this might be the place for you.  There are no smoke rings in the meat as another reviewer mentioned because there is NO smoke!  The food is made (who knows when) in Chicago in a gigantic commercial kitchen, sealed in plastic bags and sent to Urbana to be heated up in crock pots for unsuspecting folks.  The manager I talked to tried to impress me by telling me the same food is sent to the armed forces (when was the last time you heard a good review for cafeteria style military food!) and pointed out the refrigerator filled with plastic bags of their product that you could take home to heat and serve.  Because the food has to be sealed in plastic bags for days on end and shipped to various locations, it is loaded down with chemicals and preservatives that change the texture of the meat and obviously the taste.  I tried a pulled pork sandwich and found is so repulsive I brought it up to the counter and asked if I could trade it in for something else (I have NEVER done this at any other restaurant, nor have I since).  The replacement sandwich (chicken) I got was not quite as nasty, and I managed to eat some of it in my hunger and annoyance that I wasted my money, but will never, ever go back.  I get the shivers just driving by.  If you want BBQ-- real BBQ, this is definitely not the place to go!"}
{"text":"We ate here for a fundraising event today, knowing that it probably would not be amazing but still wanting to support a) the organization we were there for and b) the restaurant for participating in such events. My husband ordered rib tips, rice and beans, and a piece of jalapeno corn bread. I (inadvertantly) ordered the roasted chicken, as I assumed my meal would be in sandwich form (it was not), and a cup of chili.  My husband describes his rib tips as \"not bad, but not really good,\" the rice and beans as \"not that great,\" and the corn bread as \"not very good.\" His main problem is that everything aside from the rib tips was kind of flavorless.  The chicken was kind of tasty, unless I go to the part near the wing that wasn't AT ALL (and kind of made me feel a little sick later on). It tasted like... overcooked, or maybe like it had gone bad? The chili was \"meh.\"  The staff were actually pretty friendly!  In sum, we will probably not come back here unless there is another fundraiser, and again I find it very generous that they participate in such events."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: my father makes the best pulled pork sandwich ever. I am slightly biased. I love pulled pork. However, I am nothing if not open to new experiences.  My roommate, who went to undergrad here, suggested we order Blues on Monday night. The food came very quickly. The coleslaw that we both got to put on our sandwiches was somewhat generic--like what you might get at a grocery store. That's alright. The pork was tender, but too much sauce. The hallmark of good barbecue is that the meat tastes good regardless if it's covered in sauce or not. I wanted to get a better taste of the pork itself. Ah well, maybe if I try a different entree I can see how good the meat is. The sauce was good, if a little sweet for my taste. I really did like my friend's cornbread, though. I'd definitely give this place another chance. It wasn't terrible, it just could be better."}
{"text":"For what it is (a fancy pulled pork sandwich place) its awesome and if you are in the mood for pulled pork, collard greens, cole slaw, mac n' cheese, etc then this is also your only choice.  It is always completely empty and looks closed so don't be shy to walk right in, the staff are friendly too."}
{"text":"Blues has got the best pulled meat sandwich in town. It is super affordable and there's so much pulled meat in the sandwich that it is impossible to take a bite without being messy. Trust me, you'll need a napkin or two. They also have awesome rib tips and the best baked beans in town. This is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian bbq sandwich -- gross. It was $7 to boot and nearly all bread.  Cornbread -- delicious! Sweet and moist. The small is $0.49 and it is a little 4-bite muffin. I could have eaten two large orders ($0.99 each, total 4 muffins) at once, so order more than you think you would ever eat and it should come out to the perfect size.  Red beans and rice -- mediocre with huge chunks of sausage; about 3 oz per side dish for $1.29.  Unless I get an intense craving for cornbread that warrants fighting campus traffic to get to Blues, I won't be going back."}
