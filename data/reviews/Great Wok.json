{"text":"This place is hands down one.of the best whole in the Chinese cuisine really recommend it best to eat in"}
{"text":"very good Chinese food, way more authentic and cheaper than Panda Express. the orange chicken and fried rice is great. they have an awesome lunch special, and you get so much food. the staff was very nice and the wait time wasn't bad at all. the interior is also very clean. and they deliver!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has good ratings. The Kung Pao Chicken and Shrimp was delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and my father, who is a harsh food critic, enjoyed it very much. The egg rolls were crispy on the outside and not at all soggy on the inside. The fried rice was very well made and not at all greasy. Actually, none of the food was greasy at all. We also ordered the Vegetable Lo Mein and Moo Shu Pork. Both were good but not amazing. Overall, this is a pretty good place for your classic Chinese food and is very convenient for people in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and were looking for a good Chinese restaurant. We found it at Great Wok! The food is so fresh and always good. We have had it 10+ times, always take out or delivery, and haven't been disappointed once. Delivery is fast and everyone is friendly. The wontons and crab puffs are always crispy and flavorful, we love the Sesame chicken and often get two so we have ample leftovers (it heats up perfectly). My favorite is the beef with broccoli. The beef is so tender, never a bad piece. The broccoli is green (not gray like some places) and even when reheated, it tastes delicious. Great Wok is definitely great and we are lucky to be a mile away."}
{"text":"I don't know who is writing these reviews; I religiously use yelp, and this time I was very misled! I'm giving the 1 star for fast delivery but the food was some of the worst Chinese I've ever had! Mushy, flavorless and left my whole family feeling very ill! Even the spring rolls (which i thought impossible to screw up) were terrible! The fortune cookies were good, they were the tastiest part of the dinner! Gross, don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Not surprised they only have 2.5 stars.  The food quality is garbage.  I stopped ordering from them over a year ago though simply because they solicit illegally in apartment complexes that for security reasons they are not allowed to be in.  Illegally wandering apartment complexes and shoving their menus in our doors in NON-SOLICITATION buildings?  Whoever the owner/manager is I suggest you do business ethically and stay out of buildings you are not legally allowed in."}
{"text":"The menus sounds promisingand as an abundance of dishes. I had Gobi Manchurian, Eggplant in garlic sauce and Calamari Tempura. Since I know the original dishes from their origin countries I was a bit disappionted. They all tasted a bit overfried and spiceless. Service was friendly though, so maybe I'll comeback."}
{"text":"Great Wok is an okay option if you are in the Gateway Village part of Charlotte and need to grab some lunch. They have a pretty quick turn around on orders, though mistakes may be made.

The food quality is okay. The vegetables are definitely come from frozen. The sauces aren't all the best (General Tso's was no good). But they do offer a diverse menu. So far the one winner I had from here was the vegetable curry. After a couple tries, I have decided their tofu dishes are not worth ordering.

There is seating inside, if you choose to dine in, however, you are in Gateway Village and unless it's raining there is probably a better place to site outside. All and all, a nice place for a quick lunch. Oh, and they have smoothies."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Let's see, the food was... actually i might have given them a try but will now avoid them after they placed their menu on my front door for the 3rd time now even though the building is gated and requires security access to get in. They dont care that ive called them to stop placing ads on my door.

Bottom line. If youre too cheap to advertise using legitimate methods such as online or physical mail, then clearly there is something wrong with the business. I will tell friends and family not to go here due to trespassing on private property."}
{"text":"The food is average. Worst part is those stupid waitresses there. 
They are the meanest people in the entire experience.  
I advice my friends also not to go there - and go downtown to someplace else. 
They should learn how to work in serve in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Word to the wise....don't expect the price on their website to be correct. They have raised their rates and wouldn't honor the posted prices. Vegetable egg food young the most bland I've ever had. Vegetable low mein was 85 percent noodles. My husband said the cashew shrimp was ok. At least the quantity was good. I threw out the food young, so a meal of noodles along with an additional unexpected  $9 didn't make me happy. Will think about returning."}
{"text":"I ordered their oysters and lo mien once. Two separate occasions Ofcorse and in the summer... Don't do it ! The oysters were cold and the size of a nickel ! Also they taste like they can out of a can. 

The staff are friendly and the bubble tea/ smoothies are great ! Haha but that's it !"}
{"text":"Ok - I will be the first one to admit when I'm wrong, because I am often wrong!!  And my first experience with GREAT WOK was just that... wrong.
I'm all for giving places a second chance And WOW I'm glad I did.  I stopped in and ordered dinner to go... I was afraid to call ahead for fear of them having my number blocked (I wasn't very nice the last time I called them)
I ordered a couple of chicken egg rolls, some pot
Stickers and Kung Pao chicken and orange beef for dinner.  All I can say is that this place makes some of the BEST Chinese food we have had.  The chicken was plentiful and was all white meat, the orange beef was decent but not spectacular and the pot stickers were very tasty with hot oil and chili paste.
I'm sorry GREAT WOK - you have truly earned our business.   Thank you for a wonderful dinner.  I promise to order extra early next Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"Yes! Very good and reasonably priced food. Ordered pork fried rice, egg rolls, and General Tso's chicken. 

This restaurant delivers also. Very nice customer service."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Just terrible.  Nothing tasted like it should.  Gross.  The cleanliness or lack of it should have been the first clue.  The smoothie was ok, but the food was just not good."}
{"text":"Open late; delivers in the center city area. Subpar otherwise. Menu is expansive and has a lot of items."}
{"text":"Great food! I love all the veggies in the food especially the fried rice! Always fast delivery and reasonable prices. This is our go to Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was the best I've ever had delivered. Amazing. Tri star Mongolian is my favorite."}
{"text":"It wasn't too Americanized, therefore I WAS PLEASED. it wasn't greasy or dry- yet it was still flavorful. Great place!! I will have to come back. Although, the fortune cookies were very peculiar."}
{"text":"Great little \"fast food\" restaurant in the Gateway area of Charlotte. Eat in or take out, and you can order online. Standard Chinese menu along with some really great Indonesian items as well. I had the Gobi Manchurian and the Szechwan Chicken..Plenty of spice and really good flavor. Many items have a small and large option"}
{"text":"Still a solid 4 stars in my book.

Ordered hot and sour soup last night and it was just OK. It was very brothy, and not as dark as most hot and sour soups. I suppose when thinking of my health, this is a great thing, but it just lacked in consistancy and the flavor was a bit odd. It had a great little kick to it, which you don't often find in hot and sour soups--so good job in that regard."}
{"text":"This place is overly priced for poorly prepared food. When I order a Szeuchwan Beef, I expect the beef ratio to be greater than that of the veggies that accommodate. Tofu has always been served overcooked. Most recently, it was as if I were chewing on rubber. Also think the lunch and dinner combos aren't a great deal, seeing that drinks are not offered with the combos.

The only positive side of this place is that the people who work there are normally friendly. It's unfortunate that their food isn't up to par."}
{"text":"Love this place! cheap, fast, and good food. good service the workers are very nice!"}
{"text":"Don't let convenience fool you. Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I'm so disappointed on the quality of it. Pictures are deceiving :-("}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the bottom floor of the Gateway Village apartments. It's not a buffet, which is definitely a plus in my book. 

The food is excellent: the noodles are firm and sticky, the crab rangoon is light and crispy, the wings are big and meaty, and all the soups are fresh and delicious. 

As far as the main dishes go, all of the meat/seafood has been top quality, and the veggies are fresh and crispy. I particularly like the Garlic Shrimp and the Cashew Nut Chicken, though I change it up often because everything is so good. They even have brown rice, which not all places do (you have to ask for it specifically).

The staff is friendly and quick, and the store itself is spotless."}
{"text":"This place has good food and great portions. I normally have to order 2 orders of potstickers elsewhere to fill up. Here one order is plenty. They don't skimp one the eggs in the egg fried rice. Many other places do. The food is good and fresh. It is reasonably priced especially for the quantity of food you are getting. My husband told me to try this place and I am not disappointed. This is or new favorite authentic Chinese food restaurant. They deliver too! The delivery guy was nice and accommodating as I had a toddler on my hip. This place is great! Thank you for wonderful food and service!"}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp Fried Rice and Mongolian beef. No flavor, the flavor extractor was used.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I tried this place out this weekend with my family. We were wanting to find some good Chinese near home and we have found it. 3 people at for $24 and walked away with a to go box full. The sesame chicken was crispy and not over fried. The egg drop and wonton soups were awesome. The fried rice that came with the lunch special was a little bland. Other than that the meal was great. We ate there and the service was great. They kept our drinks full and checked on us throughout our meal. Please check them out. You won't regret it. We look forward to trying them out again and exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place when I am in town. Staff is always friendly and I always leave happy and full. Visit Great Wok if you have a chance."}
{"text":"I'll preface with this was my first visit - so maybe a 2nd chance is in order?? I got a lunch special:

 - $7.05 for a lunch special!! It does not come with a drink at the price either!

- They gave me the wrong order - I suppose my fault for not checking before I left with the takeout (but they did charge me for what I ordered).

- The fried rice was very weak - it was more like off-white rice with a piece of egg and a pea (I think those may have fallen in).

- They gave me sweet and sour chicken - not anything worth talking about.

Maybe others have had a better experience - but don't know, there has not been a posted review in several months prior to mine. I'm going back to Fortune Cookie - farther for me, but always good."}
{"text":"This place is legit!! If you want some good Chinese delivery in the Foothills look no further. The chicken egg rolls, beef peppersteak, and wonton soup are pretty much my standard order, but everything else I've had is good too. I love this place, and they deliver!!! YES!!!"}
{"text":"Maa kassam! Never expected so many indo-Chinese options in America. Food is very testy and true to indo-Chinese fusion test. Deserves 5 star for food quality, variety and price."}
{"text":"Very bad food . Had chicken teriyaki with rice .. So bad I had to trash it.. Stale food .. ...."}
{"text":"Yelp gives this place some better than average reviews.  The staff is really nice and friendly and the food was prepared relatively quickly.  I had the Singapore Special Noodles and my GF had the beef and broccoli.  Mine was cooked well and they kicked up the spice like i asked, but it was WAY TOO SALTY.  My GF's was too salty as well and said the dish had an \"odd/off-putting\" flavor to it.  I *may* give this place one more try in case this was an off-day."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. General Tso's chicken and crab puffs are excellent. Friendly service and very clean. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had given up on Chinese food.  All the Chinese restaurants food started tasting the same sweet sauces, greasy egg rolls fried in old grease, and soups with no flavor.  I no longer enjoyed Chinese food and was finding a greater interest in Thai food.  

A friend took me to Great Wok under some consternation on my part.  The food at this restaurant is great.  It is fresh.  The sauces are not sweet.  The grease is fresh when things are fried they don't come out greasy, and the hot and sour soup is the best.  I only eat Chinese food at this restaurant.  It is the best and worth the drive.  They do deliver and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new Chinese place but this was a disappointment. The delivery was VERY slow and the food was very mediocre. Our egg rolls were burnt, the lo mein noodles were more the consistency of pan noodles and didn't taste like what you expect with Chinese lo mein at all. Hot and sour soup was very bland. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"It's similar to Panda Express, very saucy but edible. I was hungry so it tasted okay."}
{"text":"Yikes. Heed the warnings of the bad reviewers and avoid this place. I ordered a bunch of food when I knew I'd be busy for a few days with work (leftovers, yes please). Lo mein was just noodles - not a veggie in sight. The general tso's chicken was gummy and there was so much sauce, it was like a soup. The chicken wings were a sad color and a few bites proved there was no seasoning. The paneer in the paneer masala was terrible. The fried rice was okay but 100% not worth going here for."}
{"text":"After many years of not going to Great Wok...I was convinced that I had to give them another try.  I was pleased with my dish...and the service was good.  I had a paneer masala which is not a typical dish you would find made in a wok house.  The tomato base was good.  the rice was served just as I like it.  I would give a higher rating...but as I waited for my food...(just about 10-12 minutes) I noticed an open door to the kitchen back room area.  There was a large tray of uncooked chicken sitting on top of a waste bin.  I was glad I was not having chicken.  I think the inspectors would have given them -8 points for improper storage.  I would like to return....but it will be difficult considering their handling of the food items. So...back to not visting the Wok again.  Sad."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery at 4:30 PM. They told us 45 minutes. Called at 5:30 PM and they said the driver was 3 minutes away. Called again at 6:00 and they said he was caught in traffic. (The restaurant is 10 minutes away.) Finally showed up at 6:05 PM. Driver apologized. Food was mostly cold, but the quality was quite good after a little microwave action. Will probably try it again, but I'll go pick it up myself."}
{"text":"Very happy to find Great Wok - it is now our standard Chinese take-out place.   If you are looking for Chinese take-out in Ahwatukee give it a shot.   My kids like the Orange Chicken and Lo Mein.   The Yu Shang Chicken and Mu Sho Pork are my 2 favorites.   The kids always want some crab puffs too.   Their food is consistently good and fast."}
{"text":"The reviews on this place are spot on! Called for delivery, food was delivered fast, hot, and delicious! We ordered the orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and the crab puffs. Everything was amazing, but the crab puffs...oh my!! :)"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese delivery - never had food from Great Wok that I didn't enjoy. The wonton soup is delicious, and I just had great shrimp in lobster sauce, too. Their vegetables are always fresh!"}
{"text":"It's just as good as any Chinese Restaurant in New York or San Francisco  Love the house EggFoo Young Always good and they deliver"}
{"text":"Talk about fresh food, and great prices, this place has it all.  When I first tried it, I was a skeptic, but then I had the food and I was greatly surprised by the good taste and quality of the food.  I suggest the Tri Star Mongolian, it was to die for!   Plus, the shrimp fried rice had plenty of shrimp, and was good in size too.  

I order from this place at least once a week, and I can make 3 or 4 meals from one entree.  

Try it, and you will be pleasantly surprised of the value and taste.  :-)"}
{"text":"This place have got alot of great reviews, and I can see why. It is not exactly what I look for in my new chinese place, but it is good food and I like the cleanliness of the place. 

I had the Honey Chicken, Orange Chicken and the Curry Chicken - and they all were good. Very basic chinese food but that is usually what the cravings are for. I should've tried something more elaborate, and I will next time.. because there will be a next time for sure."}
{"text":"This mom and pop shop is a true little gem! Everyone knows that  I'm a sucker for a lunch special and this place will certainly be a part of my lunch time rotation. Lunch specials are from $5-$10 and include soup, egg roll, wonton and your entrée. The service is fast and friendly. Most people seemed to take their food to-go. I ate in, it was a little quiet with only a small amount of ambient noise from a TV. The interior was very quaint but clean. I absolutely love a place that is generous on shrimp portions, I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Ate here on this past Thursday nite. I had spicy shrimp and an order of mix veggies. They have brown rice which gives them an automatic plus. The spicy shrimp was really good. They use whole dry red chilli peppers, which I like, I only wish they added more of them. The waittress said next time for me to just ask and they will add more. I had asked for black mushrooms in my mixed veggies and she said that she could add them on. But when I got the mixed vegies their was no black mushrooms. But the veg dish was very tastey and not over cooked. We wanted more brown rice and the waittress told us they were all out of it. So we had to settle for white rice. The bill for 3 of us was $56.00. 

I would definetly come back good food and very friendly customer service.

They don't use MSG. +++"}
{"text":"Rude, is all can say. I called to place an order. The first three times I was put on hold. Each time the person returned they asked what was I on hold for. Horrible service. I will be cooking tonight."}
{"text":"I stuck in bed and needed food other than pizza so I Yelped delivery food and it gave me this place. Very happy. I ordered pot stickers, chicken fried rice, and orange chicken. From best to worst in that order. Orange chicken wasn't bad just the other two were much better. I'd definitely use these guys again!"}
{"text":"Super good. Did not expect it to be that good. Polished off the General Tsao's chicken with ease, easily some of the best take out Chinese I've ever gotten. The pork fried rice was delicious too. If you're looking for some great food quick give this place a try."}
{"text":"Due to the convenience of parking right out front, I get takeout from here at least once a week. The new Indian fusion dishes are great. Gobi Manchurian is my personal favorite. Crunchy, spicy, with a sweet-ish sauce and fresh cilantro. It's best either eaten fresh in the restaurant or re-crisped in a 400 degree oven. I also like to get steamed veggies with sauce on the side to take home and doctor according to my preferences for a quick and lighter meal. 

The owners and people working here are so nice. They're happy to do special orders."}
{"text":"Great place to eat around the clock, everything is great but you MUST try to crab puffs as they are little bites of heaven.

Staff is always friendly when taking out, or eating in. The decor inside is dated, however this business mostly shows how good it is when you taste that first bite. The plus is that they do deliver incase you don't want to go out to grab the food, and I've never had a bad experience nor gotten sick like at other Chinese food places. 

All around, it's great for the food and pretty cheap for what you get."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in Ahwatukee to get Chinese food! It's always great and delivery is pretty quick. Orange chicken is my favorite! The crab puffs are awesome too."}
{"text":"Very impressed with both the taste and portion size! My wife got the chicken wings and Thai tom yum soup w/shrimp and I got the Mongolian beef - all very tasty! Delivery was pretty reasonably fast too. I tipped the delivery guy $5 because he delivered to the room even though The Westin Charlotte \"prohibits \" it. Recommended."}
{"text":"for a delivery Chinese restaurant I really can't complain. fast and friendly, and food was pretty good but if I was in the mood to leave my house to eat Chinese this wouldn't even come to mind as an option, but I will recommend it for people that are able to have them deliver to you it's a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"I love this place. We eat here very often and the food is very good and the staff are fabulous. We have eaten in and carry out and always consistent. Very clean and bright inside if you stay to eat. Watch out you may have to wait if sitting down. They know how to take care of you and the food they serve you!!"}
{"text":"Another Yelp winner! The food is awesome and the lunch specials are amazing. For just over $6 got soup, delicious lemon chicken with fried rice and a crab puff and won ton. All top quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a 5 star giver however I am very impressed and might I add full from this place. I had the food delivered after searching Yelp for chinese delivery. The food arrived faster than a pizza and it was HOT! I had the orange chicken and shrimp and asked for it not to be spicy and it wasn't. My son is a picky eater like lo mien but not the veggies and they hooked him up with chicken lo mien only. So we are sold!
The online menu on Yelp is out dated and prices are a few dollars more."}
{"text":"This little place is a gem.  They are smart and efficient at taking your order, ringing you up at register., etc.   Good Chinese food is not easy to find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If you're in Ahwatukee, this is your go-to for Chinese food. The sweet sour soup is outstanding...perfect vinegary heat. We also like the veggie moo shu and the Phoenix Dragon. All the veggies are very fresh and their delivery is fast. The family that runs it is totally kind...we've never had anything but a great experience."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent food. Flavorful. Will be back. Probably won't go to Panda any longer."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. I've eaten there now about 5 times and I love it! They are very friendly and polite. Delivery service is great too! I really didn't wait very long for my food to be delivered so I was thrilled. Hot and Sour soup was sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Terrible Delievery.  The food was old not fresh.  The order was incomplete, management refused to make corrections after i made a complaint.  I dont care if this is thexlast chinese restuarant standing, I will never buy from them again.  The owner woman is exremely rude."}
{"text":"Good food that is always fresh.  Everyone is really nice at this establishment.  We usually order the sesame chicken.  This isn't a complaint, but merely a suggestion .  The decor is outdated and I think a little paint and new decor with the right ambience  would make this place awesome.  I've ate at the restaurant about two times but decided to only order take out going forward. Good food for the price! The only thing I don't like is that I always feel crappy after eating there. It's a tired, sluggish feeling which probably is brought on by the ingredients that they utilize."}
{"text":"The other Yelp reviews didn't lie. We ordered delivery and it arrived within 20 MINUTES!!! The food was hot, fresh, not greasy, probably the best crab puffs I've ever had. We also ordered the Happy Family, Orange Chicken and House Lo Mein with fried rice. All were incredible. House-made hot mustard tops it off. So happy to have discovered my new favorite Chinese delivery place!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese I've had in my three years here in AZ. From the egg rolls to the shrimp fried rice, even my beef and broccoli was awesome. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"The reviews made me believe this place was amazing, however I was super sick last night. We ordered lo mein, chop suey, beef and broccoli, and some egg rolls, even those tasted awful! Food was mushy, tasted all the same. Highly disappointed. I've waited months for some take out! But I was up all night with a horrible stomachache! Quality of food was poor!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided on this little hole in the wall based on yelp reviews and we were not dissapointed. The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. The only downside was that it felt short staffed so service was a bit slow but we will definately return."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they always mess-up my order.. Ignore the instructions provided with the order."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we try this place instead of a well-known chain that we frequent, and we are officially converts. 

The first night we had the honey chicken and shrimp and wonton soup. The soup was full of interesting things like pork, and large veggies and a huge wonton. The honey chicken and shrimp were both great - lightly fried but not greasy, and the sauce had just enough spice to it. The portion size was very generous.

The next time I didn't get to join, but my husband went with his son and they tried a different soup and the cashew chicken, as well as the honey chicken and shrimp again. The soup was also full of nice surprises and both chicken dishes were wonderful. Both of them had enough left over for another meal.

The servers were very nice and the food came out very quickly and was fresh and hot. 

I hope the carry out and delivery orders are enough to keep them going, because both nights the restaurant was nearly empty. But we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Pathetic service from the lay(having piercing). She was so rude in her behavior. I spend $9 to $10 every day here for food and i get this response from the staff. The other older lady from the staff is good. The food is good and meets my expectation but since I was given a bad service today, it ruined everything and compelled me to write a bad review. So just one star for your stupid manner less behavior. Try to teach your staff how to talk to people."}
{"text":"Best WonTon soup around! Never a fail when ordering from Great Wok.  Food is consistently good, friendly service and quick delivery.  Can't ask anymore from take out!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Every time.  Lunch Special can not be beat.  Worth a trip from anywhere.  Great Menu...Great Food...Great Wok."}
{"text":"I had all but given up on finding a great Chinese restaurant in Ahwatukee, but...  I am very pleasantly surprised. Really enjoyed eating Chinese food with chicken that was all white meat & zero mystery meat. They will cook to order off menu items, which is awesome. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"I love this place! How am I just now discovering it?

This is a traditional \"Chinatown\" Chinese food restaurant in a lot of ways -- a lot of GOOD ways. I had been missing the flavor of good \"San Francisco\" tasting Chinese food, but I hadn't been able to find it until now. Even better that it's right here in Ahwatukee too.

I sampled a bunch of different items, and I was happy with every single thing. The pot stickers and egg rolls were good. The fried rice was tasty. And, the chicken and shrimp dish I had were all amazing.

The staff was very helpful. And, even the ambiance of Great Wok felt like an old school Chinatown restaurant. Love it. This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yuck! This is the worst Chinese takeout. Don't order from here, you will regret it.

I got the chicken with broccoli, and there was no flavor what so ever. 
Also got the dumplings which were awful as well."}
{"text":"The decor isn't much to brag about but the food makes up for it. I ordered the Orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. Both were very good and taste authentic."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food. Also felt sick immediately. Nothing was properly cooked. Worst Chinese food"}
{"text":"I'm never ordering from here ever again !!

Ordered the manchurian - it was all greasy and and every bite was like a ball of oil.
Additionally - i ordered the paneer lo mein - they were blend without any flavor.

I'm never ordering from here ever again !!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service! Tried this place based on other Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have lived in 3rd Ward since Nov '16 and we just found the Great Wok after they recently left a flier on my door. The me he was expansive and we decided to try the General chicken, chicken lo mein, shrimp fried rice, and several egg rolls. I went to pick it up at the restaurant and the place was busy. There were several people eating dinner, about 6 people waiting on take out orders, and about 4 orders waiting for the delivery guy to deliver. The staff was very nice and even double checked my order before I paid for it. Most importantly, the food was really good, fresh, hot, and flavorful. We will definitely go back and so happy to know this place is just around the corner."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time as we discovered this hole in the \"wall\" that does a good job with the local Chinese delicacies like potstickers, lettuce wrap. They also have a good choice of typical American Chinese choices made a la china style like shrimp with vegetables, black pepper beef,etc. prices have climbed up a bit but still ok for your value. Jane is the main lady and she and her husband do a good job with the clientele. Come any time. Xue xie!"}
{"text":"We enjoy stopping here on our walk each Sunday from church. I like the Chicken Lo Mein (spicy). Nice quiet place with friendly owners. The water is filtered and very good. We have also had take out food which was excellent."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. First time, very fast fresh vegetables, clean, attention to detail with prep and presentation. And tasted really good I don't know how we didn't know about this place."}
{"text":"Ugggghhhh.... this place is so good! I'm always scared when ordering from a new place. I ordered from here when I was staying at a client's house, because they were in the delivery area. Was not disappointed. Their honey chicken is amazing. I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes. I still eat here, but I live in Tempe so I'm out of the delivery area. I only get it when I feel like driving all the way to pick it up. Worth it though. So delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great place probably one of the better take-out spots. I do believe the place is a little over priced due to the lower volume of customers they have but overall really good place. Lived uptown for years and have visited multiple times. I can say I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my second try here... I really want to like it because it is close to where I work.  Sadly, I don't think I will be coming back... hibachi chicken is dry, over cooked and the sauce is bland to the point of tasteless.  Previous meal was curry chicken and probably worse... too bad because I LOVE Chinese food"}
{"text":"This is some pretty good food. I ordered takeout. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. Most Chinese take out isn't. But this was surprisingly delicious. We ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken and Green Curry. The sweet and sour chicken was made with all white breast meat. It was cooked perfectly. And arrived right on time."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!!
Fresh! Looked great! Tasted even better!
Terriaki chicken is amazing!!"}
{"text":"For a little hole in the wall, they serve truly great food! It's fast, delicious, and very affordable. I often pick up, but their delivery is always super fast too. Their egg rolls rock, I love their curry chicken, and veggie anything is always good. Definitely make it a point to give them a try."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I loved the food. It was a great deal for the lunch special and you get soup with it. I ordered the Cashew Chicken with Hot and Sour Soup and it by far was the best chinese food i have had for a while. I will go back again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here regularly for several years.  This is my favorite place to get great Chinese food.  I have never had bad service.  My order is always freshly prepared and perfectly cooked.  I love Great Wok!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place but 
Food was good.
Take away or dine in. Could use some new interior. Lol"}
{"text":"Went to Great Wok last night for takeout. Went closer to closing time but food still hot and fresh. Great wok had really yummy Honey Chicken. Just the right amount of spice. I also liked the crab puffs. My friend got the Sweet and Sour chicken and he enjoyed that. He has a sensitive stomach so he appreciated the fact it wasnt greasy. Will return when in the area. Cant wait to try out their delivery service ."}
{"text":"I can only vouch for the Mongolian Beef as I order the same thing every time but the quality of the food and portions are excellent.  The staff is always friendly upon pickup. Not the greatest ambience if you choose to dine in.  The interior could use some updating."}
{"text":"Chinese food here is good.  I've been here twice neither time I was disappointed.  Sadly to say this is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area.  Wish there was more choices but beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"Reviewing solely for the slushie/ smoothie things: OMG so amazing! I've never had the food but frequent for those drinks, you should get one!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out from here, it's pretty good for such a huge variety of Asian options. I like the hot and sour soup, anything fried app wise can be hit or miss because sometimes it comes cooked correctly, other times drenched in grease and inedible. All in all, pretty much my go to for takeout Chinese"}
{"text":"Great service.   Online ordering is awesome.   Delivery is not always available but the location at Gateway is super convenient for pickup.   Some of the best Hot and Sour soup around!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered the egg foo young, and the the gravy was delicious. My only complaint; I specifically asked for a bunch of sweet and sour and got a tiny cup."}
{"text":"Great little find! My wife and I have been here a few times and have enjoyed it every visit. We come for lunch on the weekends because it's nearby and we've always been able to have a great lunch. This is our go-to Chinese place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time this food is not good the hibachi chicken is subpar and the pad Thai is disgraceful!! Very unorganized staff owner had a meltdown in front of paying customers..sad"}
{"text":"Great Chinese Food...I live in Maricopa I traveled quite a ways to find this gem! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I love the Gateway Village area, and I love Great Wok. It's fast and good, and it's the typical Chinese takeout menu. Nothing too fascinating, but a solid menu.

My favorite is the Curry Tofu. It's just spicy enough, and the portion size is big enough that when I order this dish for lunch, I usually have leftovers for dinner. They've got a kind of cool frequent diner reward card, where you get your 11th meal free after you purchase 10. I'm a sucker for these kinds of deals...my wallet is bursting at the seams with them. 

Gateway Village somehow makes you feel like you've gotten away from uptown, which is nice for lunch breaks. Visit Great Wok, get your generic Chinese yummy, and go eat in the graveyard nearby for an awesome noon hour."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant to dine in. The people there were nice. It was clean and neat. I didn't have to wait a long time. I ordered the Pad Thai Noodle Chicken. The noodle was nicely cooked, the sauce was sweet, the chicken was cooked nicely. The taro and coconut smoothies were also tasty. They also offer frequent buyer cards. Once you order 10 meal you get 8 dollars off when you use it. T"}
{"text":"If you are too lazy to leave the house, this is just another option for delivery. I'm not surprised that none of dishes I ordered tasted like what I would normally expect if I were to have gone to a Indian, thai, or Japanese restaurant that specializes in those cuisines.  For one restaurant to carry Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Indian food was a red flag to me. Should have just gone with my instinct and not ordered from there. Tasted like something I tried to make myself."}
{"text":"Had this orders from doordash on Friday.  Great food cooked just right. 
I had the orange chicken with wontons. They where outstanding I will be back"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. My wife and I decided to stop here because we were craving Chinese food and this place delivered with out a doubt. Cant wait to order here again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Garlic Chicken.  It was delightfully spicey, garlicky without being overpowering.  The water chestnuts were crisp, the broccoli was nicely done, but the chicken was a bit sparse. I'd order this again.  This rating is solely for this dish."}
{"text":"I used to live about 100 feet from this place.  I loved it - their Chicken and Broccoli and their beef and broccoli are excellent.  They have great fried rice and spring rolls also.  It is pretty inexpensive and they get your food ready quickly!  This place does most of its business at lunch so if you are going for lunch plan to arrive a little early.  There will be a line out the door during most \"normal\" lunch hours."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Every dish is delicious and fresh! Best wonton soup ever!!! Try this place now!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food takes minutes to get and is hot and fresh. This vegetarian approves! Definately best chinese food and carry out in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Great fresh fast delivery! I've ordered in twice, and both times I've not been disappointed. The minimum delivery order is $15.00. This is perfect for a two person, maybe even three person meal! I typically order enough for delivery, and then put the rest in the fridge. This is not the last time I'll be ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Been here once during my lunch break. The host was friendly and the food was a good size portion and quite flavorful."}
{"text":"One star for location. I've had better and cheaper meals out of cardboard boxes from my freezer. Since Chinese food is off my diet, it's a seldom treat and my order is usually an appetizer of pan fried pork dumplings and a main course of sesame chicken.

My last Chinese food order was from a small place in rural Pennsylvania and thinking back it was amazing. Tender chicken fried perfectly with a tasty sauce and plump doughy dumplings that were golden brown.

Unfortunately this was dry and bland chicken poorly fried and tasting stale. The dumplings had a gyoza texture with no browning and were not plump like I expect Chinese dumplings to be. Overall just the worst cheat meal I've ever had. You can get better Chinese food frozen at Trader Joe's (or maybe Trader Ming's)."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Great Wok a few weeks ago while searching Yelp for Chinese food. Wow! The place is small, but the food is amazing and the price is right. It was a Friday evening and they must have been short staffed. While the service was friendly, it was slow. My orange chicken was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. My husband ordered the Mongolian beef which was pretty tasty, even though it isn't on my list of top choices. My husband enjoyed it very much. :-) The dumplings were perfect and the wontons weren't at all greasy (as they can sometimes be). We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time at great wok. The service was awesome we had our order taken and had it out within 15 minutes. Food is delicious I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"The staff has always been friendly and accommodating. Food tastes authentic and fresh. This is a definite place to return to over and over again."}
{"text":"It's not that the food is off the charts amazing. It's just that it's convenient and reasonably priced. Whenever we want Chinese food, this is where we go."}
{"text":"Great balls of fire this place is frickin' lit. My food was ready in 6 minutes, it was ready before I could even say \"sesame chicken\" mm so tasty great wok thank you"}
{"text":"All I can say is that it was okay.  Out of the many things I tried, I think the moo shu is my favorite thing on the menu.  Everything else I tried was just decent.  Coming from San Francisco and having had access to Chinatown on a daily basis, I may be a bit biased."}
{"text":"Loved this place, the experience is far beyond what you'd normally expect from a strip mall Chinese food restaurant. The service was prompt & friendly, the food was delicious, and the price was very reasonable. 

During the course of the meal I also found out that they deliver to the local area, sign me up!"}
{"text":"I have read a lot of mixed reviews about this place but decided to try it for lunch. Place was packed but they are very fast. I got the lo mein with general Tso chicken. The chicken was decent but the noodles are one of my favorite. They use tons of garlic so make sure u have gum or mints"}
{"text":"I would so love to give this place 1 star because it took over two hours to get our delivery last night (and I live 4 minutes away), but alas the food was so yummy I can't! We ordered the pot stickers and lettuce wraps, both far above average. The little one got orange chicken and this little foody was happy! We also got fried tofu with veggies, extra spicy and it was good...could have used more spice in my book. The general tsos chicken was also above average. 
Overall, I'm not big into Chinese food, but I could get into this place...but I will pick up next time. 

PS despite what happened with the delivery, the service was friendly and we were promised a free entree next time due to the hassle."}
{"text":"This has got to be some of the worst food I have ever eaten. The egg drop soup made me gag :( it was thick, chunky with a weird salty taste. The meat I think might have not been cooked all the way but either way; poor grade meat. It was spongy, chewy, crunchy....I ended up throwing it away. The cheese wonton was good."}
{"text":"LM9 Singaporean Rice Noodle not the best, but it was still good. I also got an egg roll. Was spicy and hot and was made quickly."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new Chinese spot for delivery and I heard great things about this spot... So I gave them a call and ordered Moo Shu Pork and two egg rolls plus I went with an order of Mongolian Beef. I would rate the food as followed.

Moo Shu Pork - A
Mongolian Beef - C
Egg Rolls - B + 

I gave the Mongolian Beef a C because I could hardly find the crispy rice noodles that made it just so full of onions and really not what I was hoping for. The Moo Shu Pork was really good... But all in all it was pretty good I may give it another try."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a fast-foody looking Chinese restaurant: fast good, mediocre quality. But it's not as bad as you may fear. A lot of their stuff seemed pretty fresh and not as greasy as most similar Chinese restaurants, which was a huge plus for me. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago and my meal wasn't terrible, so decent in fact that we ordered in recently (super fast delivery--the food was pipin' hot!). 

Again, if you're in the mood for a nice chinese meal, head elsewhere. But if you want a quick chinese option, this place is perfect. And that's saying a lot. I loved the Chicken Kung Pao, and the noodles were actually pretty decent, too. 

Most of all, the people who work there are super sweet, which makes going there a pleasant experience (although i wouldn't suggest eating there; it's like a cafeteria)."}
{"text":"Just ate the sweet and sour chicken with steamed rice and some crab puffs and they brought me a Dr Pepper.  they deliver the items in a relatively short amount of time and were very courteous and pleasant on the phone.  I had no issues whatsoever with the food or the staff.  I felt like everything was hot and fresh.  I will definitely be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Four months later and I still haven't set the apartment gate up with my phone number. I am the bane of the delivery driver's existence.

With that confession tossed out there, I ordered from Great Wok tonight. I came home after work, giddy with the thought of a three-day weekend ahead, and realized the only fish I had in the house was a very unappealing frozen piece of tilapia. The woes of Lent. I can't survive off of the wilted English cucumber chillin' in the veggie drawer, so I had to give in and order delivery (I have the horrible tendency of not leaving the house once I get inside and realize how comfortable the couch is. Unless something important is going on, like a hamster fashion show or Chumbawamba's reunion tour. You know. The big stuff), and it had to be either a) vegetables or b) seafood. Chinese clearly fit these categories beautifully.

I did not want a repeat of my last Chinese order, so I reexamined Yelp and found Great Wok again. Score. Called them. ...No answer. Determined to have some delicious Diocese-approved dinner (alliteration FTW), I made the fat kid in me chill out and called them again 5 minutes later, spoke to a very nice young guy, and ordered crab puffs, fried tofu with vegetables, and shrimp with vegetables. I hung up and realized I ordered enough for a small army (damn delivery minimums), and as a newly single lady that meant a lot of leftovers.

The time estimate I was given was 45 minutes, and the food showed up within half an hour AND the delivery guy did not call freaking out about my gate being closed. (Yesss...I don't have to feel like an asshole.) Gentleman shows up at my door and hands me my food, and I sign the receipt thinking \"This better be worth $26effing94...\"

Oh, it was. Shrimp that looked (AND TASTED!) like shrimp and not something my ten pound dog craps out on a walk. Crisp vegetables. Flavorful sauce and not pools of grease. Crispy crab puffs. I would have taken a picture to show the deliciousness of it all, but I began inhaling it too fast to even think about it. I have died and gone to Chinese delivery heaven, y'all. You will not regret ordering from this place...!"}
{"text":"friendly staff.. the food just wasn't good. i'm high as hell and this shit is still garbage /:"}
{"text":"Tried it based on yelp ratings. Not many veggie options. Tried the tofu veggie soup which was alright - although a little bland. The Kung pao veggies were good - medium spicy. Also the veg fried rice has eggs in it which I didn't know. So I came back to get a refund but unfortunately they do only store credits or another rice exchange. The lady was ready to give me veg fried rice with no eggs. Overall ok to try once. Not many mouthwatering dishes which will pull me back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered online from their website after one of the menus was stuck in my door at my condo community... I placed my order and received my email confirmation at 2:59PM saying my order will be delivered by 3:45PM. 45 minutes is their standard delivery time so around 4PM I called and the guy told me that they didn't get my order until 3:30. What's the point of ordering online if the company doesn't check or receive online orders until 30 minutes after the fact? When I questioned it he said the company that handles the online orders needs to text them when people order... not my issue and never will be again. Not ordering from here ever again. Save yourself the time and hanger."}
{"text":"Surprisingly let down after reading the reviews.  I was hoping to find my new Chinese place in Ahwatukee.  Their fried rice that came with the entrees was like eating white rice that was over cooked.  It has no veggies or meat in it.  We ordered the chicken and broccoli and general Tso's.  Both were okay.  Going to keep trying for a good place in the area."}
{"text":"First time ordering here, received most of our order but not the fried rice...to their credit, they made it right and made a second delivery about 30 minutes later with the rice. The good news is that the food was delicious and piping hot when it got to us. I'm hoping this was simply an oversight because we'd really like to order from them again."}
{"text":"do not order from this place! i spent 30 dollars for delivery and when it arrived, it had NO seasoning, no salt, no sauce, nothing! the chicken was rubbery, i'm not even a picky eater and i never complain about restaurants, but this was so inedible. they are scamming people."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Typical family style Chinese place where you order three or four things and share everything. We had orange chicken, fried rice, and cashew chicken, all of which were fantastic. 

We also had wonton soup and potstickers. The potstickers were perfectly cooked for my liking (tender with a crispy side) and the wonton soup was full of good stuff, rather than a bunch of broth with a few pieces of chicken. 

The staff was helpful and quick, despite being busy. (We went on New Years Eve so there was a lot of takeout orders).

They seemed to have an efficient process for the takeout line, but we really enjoyed eating in because they brought things out right when they were ready. They were staggered in timing which was nice.

All in all, it was a fantastic experience. They deserve the 5 stars."}
{"text":"The restaurant smells like burning plastic.

I actually liked the food. Got delivery several times and enjoyed it. However, the pork friend rice we got a couple nights ago had RAW PORK in it.

:("}
{"text":"I grabbed the special of the day on the day before Thanksgiving. It was a green curry with chicken and it was wonderful. I have tried the place a few times over the past year. They serve selections of mixed ethnic origins. It seems the curries may be the best bet because that was delicious. For me this is an inexpensive, local spot. I have met the store owner several times and her service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp and scallop with the garlic sauce and it was fantastic. The restaurant is not fancy, but the food makes up for it. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. My first experience there tonight and will definitely be my last. The cashier clearly didn't want to help me because she was so engaged in a conversation with a younger man sitting at a table about 3 feet away. When she finally did break away from that conversation she asked what I wanted. Midway through my order she walked away from the register so naturally I stopped giving her my order her response \"keep goin' I can hear you.\" But then when I continued my order she said \"huh? What did you want?\" 3 times. As I'm waiting for my food to be prepared I see her yelling at the elder asian delivery man, \"just take the order! Can you just go? Take the freakin order. (Man takes the to go bag and starts walking) and she throws her hands in the air while saying \"thank you!\" With the worst and ghetto attitude I've ever seen. I was polite as possible but it was clear that she didn't favor being polite to anyone that was a different race than her. I've worked in the service industry for 11 years and I've never seen someone have such a disgusting attitude towards another person while on the clock. Such a disappointment because I thought while I was walking down the street back home that I had found a gem and I would have a convenient place to order asian food! Nope. Nope. Nope."}
{"text":"We order take out from here in our office quite a few times. Every time the food is pipping hot and delish! I love the Honey chicken it's YUMMY. I love their lunch specials and prices."}
{"text":"By far the absolute worst Chinese food my wife and I have ever eaten. Actually we could not eat it because of the rawness of the meat. Lemon Chicken was raw and the Teriyaki chicken wasn't even chicken. Both dishes smelled bad as well. We maybe had a half a bite of each dish and told them we couldn't eat it. Still charged us for the meals. We'll never go to this place again. GROSS!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few times here and hands down best of Ahwatukee. We've tried many dishes including General Tso and it is very delicious. Family owned and operated. Place of choice for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite spots.  Love this place and their lunch specials cannot be beat. They have the best sizzling rice soup in AZ.  I am from Cali and this is the only place that does it well so far in Az. The sesame chicken and shrimp chow mein are family favorites. They are our go to Chinese place.  If you are looking for ambiance though not really so much. But the food makes up for it a hundred fold. Now I want it for dinner. Plus the servers and staff are sooooo nice!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great kungpao vegs!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent selection of vegetarian/vegan Chinese food. I recommend the spicy basil eggplant dish, there's plenty for leftovers and it's very flavorful & filling. The tofu could be marinated longer for more flavor in other dishes I've tried but you can't go wrong with their eggplant dishes."}
{"text":"My original review complained about how there wasn't an online ordering system.  I stand by that still - but I need to add that ordering by phone is not terrible.  I always get fast friendly service, and that can't replace a computer. 

What hasn't changed: The food is fantastic, and this place deserves to be a neighborhood favorite.  I get delivery from Great Wok at least once a week, and I've gotta tell ya - its always super hot, super fresh, and the delivery guy is always so friendly.  I can't recommend this place enough.

The staff is so great - polite, helpful, and friendly every time I order.  The food is served in fantastic portions, and to order.  ( I have a food allergy that can be a pain.)

This is the Chinese restaurant that Ahwatukee has needed for years!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for some good sweet and sour chicken. Maybe it was because I was running late on lunch break and I originally wanted delivery but they wouldn't deliver to me(I'm literally 10 minutes away) but my food was soggy and the \"fried rice\" was bland. Crab puffs were good but not hot at the point I got to them. If they delivered to me I'd give them 4 stars. Not the best American Chinese food I've ever had but certainly not the worst. I was starving and pregnant so it did the trick. The lunch special price was great however. I will probably try it again when I can actually go to the restaurant and eat there"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is really a hidden treasure. The people are super friendly and the food is really good. It's take out but it's much better than a lot of sit down places in the city. We had the Pad Se Ewe, General Tso Chicken, and the Thai Red Curry with veg and tofu. Not too salty and perfect spice level and the veggies aren't over cooked. Portions were a nice size and worth the price. We have plenty of leftovers. I don't understand the bad reviews. Our experience was awesome. Plus if you sit outside they are dog friendly.  They even came out to check on us. I'll be going back weekly."}
{"text":"My nickname for this place is Satisfactory Wok. It's really close to my apartment, so I was hoping this would become my new go-to for when I don't feel like cooking or get a craving for Chinese. 

The service is quick and the prices are very reasonable, but I haven't been back since my initial visit. The food was fine (hence the nickname), but there are other spots Uptown at a similar price point with better-than-satisfactory food."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered any Chinese around the neighborhood in awhile  and found this place through yelp.. delivery was fast and the food is decent.. I wouldn't give it more then 3 stars but who knows if it will change if I order something else next time.."}
{"text":"I love this place. We order take out about once a week. The garlic chicken with vegetables is very tasty as is the Mongolian beef.  Mushu pork is good. The lunch specials are a great value. The service is very personable and sweet.

I have eaten in the place twice, and prefer take out - they do a lot of business via takeout, so there are people coming and going a lot, and the phone ringing all the time can be a bit much."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Chinese food in Ahwatukee! I recommend the Mongolian beef or shrimp lo mein. The lunch special is unbeatable. Great service. Family owned and operated. I've been going here for over 10 years and it has never disappointed me. Easily 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great food at a great value. Vegetables are always fresh and perfectly cooked and the service is friendly. Eating on the restaurant doesn't have much atmosphere so we usually get takeout. Convenient location if you are in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and my family's go to if we feel like Chinese take out. The food, especially the Kung Pao shrimp and Hong Kong Style Pan Fried noodles always arrive piping hot and really delicious.

The phone gets picked up quickly and the service is always friendly. One tip though, call and order earlier on Fri and Sat evenings. They get super busy!

I once called for dinner at 6.30pm on Friday and the delivery wait was over an hour (ouch)"}
{"text":"This is my second and last time eating here. It's close to my work so I gave it another shot. They over fried my chicken so bad I couldn't even bite into it. The rice is very bland and the prices are pretty high for the quality of food they are serving. Won't come here again. Paid $10 for food I threw away, not even worth saving for leftovers."}
{"text":"Phoned in carryout order for chicken lo mein and chicken fried rice with no onions. Fresh, tasty generous portions prepared without onions as requested."}
{"text":"This is not the worst Chinese food I have had but it comes close... The potstickers are good, the hot and sour soup lacks flavor, and I have had better general tso's out of the freezer at the grocery store. I mIght have my bar set high from the east coast, but I would have to give this 2 stars..."}
{"text":"This place is great! First time there!  I ordered vegetable egg roll, pot stickers, vegetable egg fu young, vegetable fried rice and beef chop suey.  Everything was very good!! No complaints here! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Great Wok for lunch the other day and it was well worth the money. I ordered orange chicken off their lunch special menu. It was very good. It wasn't your typical sweet orange chicken. It had a little spice to it and you could actually see the red chili flakes in the sauce. The lunch special also included soup and a side of fried rice. The service was fast and the waitress was nice. She was also quick to refill our drinks which is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I leave a review for a place. Never felt the need to do so. This post represents my opinion based on my experience eating from this place. I spent $30 on dumplings, calamari, egg drop soup, and some Indian chicken. I swear I'm not a picky eater - the only good thing on this order was the egg drop soup. The dumplings were supposed to be veggie dumplings but felt as if they were stuffed with cartilage, the calamari looked decent but had no taste, and the Indian chicken almost made me throw up - it had all sorts of meat even though the menu said it was white meat - it had cartilage, chicken skin, and chewy chicken meat (definitely not white meat). Totally disgusting."}
{"text":"Solid four stars. Food isn't over- breaded or too sauced up. Good spice and the folks are friendly."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I have ever had . I wish I can give it a zero star on Yelp. The price is  pricey compared to its food quality as the food taste really bad. We spent $20+ for a tasteless Pad Thai noodle and a Broccoli beef with weird sauce. I am not a frequent Yelp user but this time I believe I should say something. FYI, for people who wants to have Chinese food in Charlotte, just stay away and don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Lived in the area all these years and finally tried this place based on the Yelp reviews. Food was very good, fresh vegetables as everyone points out.  Take out was ready on time, friendly wait staff and will definitely go back again.  House fried rice was very good and had REAL life-sized shrimp, not rock shrimp.  Hot/sour soup was very good."}
{"text":"I've only had delivery from Great Wok. The food came quick. I felt it was a little pricey compared to other Chinese takeout places in the area, but the servings are huge."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is my first review ever on yelp. Ugh. Gross. Chinese food is supposed to be good. This was not. Got 2 shrimp and chicken hibachi meals (thank god small size), spent $25 for the both of us. No flavor at all. It tasted like they had made the food the day before and heated them in the microwave in the same containers they served it to us in. It also took 5 minutes to get us our food so I'm guessing that's about right. I took about 5 bites, left, and am now at the pizza place down the street. I also didn't read any reviews before walking in because I was craving Chinese. If anyone has recommendations for a good Chinese place please let me know. Until then I'll stick to pizza :)"}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time since it's right below us, but the last time we went it wasn't so good. I've gotten many different things here that for awhile I loved. Last time I got chicken with broccoli and it was so gross and watery. I've also gotten the coconut chicken, which is delicious, but I ended up getting sick from it. The good thing about this place is that they offer frequent buyer cards. So once you get to like 9 meals the 10th one is free. All in all I would recommend it, but don't expect it to be amazing every time. I think it depends on how busy they are for the quality."}
{"text":"did someone call for chinese delivery? cuz tonight people, i'm staying in! let's all say it in unison now.... *GASP* 

yes, michelle is hanging up her friday night party dress and ordering up some chinese food. sure, i just referred to myself in the third person, but there are a lot things not exactly right in 'tukee town tonight. 

i'm staying in for a very special reason though. it's my little brother joey's birthday tomorrow and we're having a big celebration... and guess who's offered to make his favorite cake (homemade carrot cake with cream cheese frosting) from scratch? YES, ME! and even the frosting is being made from scratch. oh, did i mention i'm doubling the batch to make cupcakes and then also preparing my famous slow cooker pork roast for the party too? it's gonna be a busy night in the Idziorek kitchen tonight, oh yea.

as you can see, cooking for myself wasn't an option tonight. since i have never ordered chinese delivery here in arizona before, i had to do some really stealthy yelpy research. come to find out there are exactly TWO places that will deliver to my 'hood. great. love the options.

so first i called the other place, pei wok. the line was busy. i waited, and tried again. BUSY. well, too bad pei wok, you're the big loser tonight. the winner by default was great wok. they answered on the first ring, and the kid that answered the phone was nice. they didn't have a menu online anywhere, so he proceeded to go through their menu items with me one by one. 

i ended up getting the prawns in lobster sauce, the beef lo mein and some steamed rice. the food arrived within 40 minutes, it was steaming hot and it smelled great before i could even bust open the bag. 

the prawns were plentiful, the lobster sauce done exactly right and the lo mein nice and greasy the way a good lo mein should be. i found the food overall to be flavorful, the portions large and everything reasonably priced.

see pei wok, this could've been all about you.... except you couldn't splurge with the phone company and get that extra phone line to take my call. too bad. 

PS: i only gave them 4 stars because it's my first time ordering with them... i'll adjust accordingly after a few more orders."}
{"text":"Solid American style Chinese food. Cooked fresh with good ingredients. Small place that's just s hole in the wall but it's worth checking out.

Only been once so far so will update this review after trying It more times down the road."}
{"text":"Been ordering here for years. Not that good to be honest but quick and hot. Tough meats and crummy quality proteins but hey, those cats and stray dogs don't cook themselves. The delivery guy used to break his neck \"casing\" out my apartment while i signed the bill. I order from Fujo now like an adult with money."}
{"text":"Ordered Hunan Beef and Hot N Sour soup takeout.  The order was ready when I arrived, ten minutes later and man was it good!  The vegetables in the Hunan Beef were al dente as they should be, the beef was good, and the brown sauce was excellent.  A great garlic flavor. Really enjoyed this version as much as any I've had. The Hot N Sour soup was good. They threw in a couple extra chili sauces so I could kick it up a bit. The prices are good, too: $9.95 for the large Hunan Beef and $4.50 for a quart of soup.  Not bad.

This is a very casual place where you order at the counter. Not fancy, but don't let the casual, fast food appearance fool you, the food is great. They also have online ordering and delivery.  They also have Thai, Japanese, and Indian dishes on the menu.  

This would be my regular delivery Chinese if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"This place will surely become our go-to for Chinese. We tried the chicken and broccoli, the curry chicken and the gobi manchurian (dry). I was skeptical of the gobi manchurian, but it was amazing. Quite a bit spicy, but excellent. In fact, everything was excellent and out very fast! It is definitely a great take-out place. Perfect for wanting to stay in, but have also wanting to have good food."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are a great deal and portions are great. Food is fresh and full of flavor. I order regularly and I have not been disappointed. Staff is friendly and the service level is great. I am very happy we have this little hidden gem near by."}
{"text":"All Chinese food places are not created equal!  
       Case and point, The Great Wok...  Here in the heart of the Queen City.  I thought here I am in the midst of Charlotte!  This Chinese food must be on point.  I have never been more mistaken.  
     This food is subpar to put it very, very mildly.  The chicken scallion is tough and tasteless!  But to their credit, there is no doubt that you're eating bonafide chicken.  That is something I appreciate.
      The Lo Mein is an additional dollar for greasy, brown, bland noodles with no vegetables or seasonings.  Just slimy strings.  
      Their smoothie was the best thing they served, but still NOT good.  The tapioca pearls did not flow through the drink.  Instead they all fell to the bottom so I finished them after my beverage.
     Basically I paid $22. For lunch including a drink, and not only wasn't it worth the money, it was a waste of calories.
     I waited twenty minutes for my order.  
     They had a fairly decent sanitation score of 92 on the wall and the staff was fairly polite.  It is for that reason They earned two stars,  but still  all of that food will go to the garbage."}
{"text":"I'm with Ada G.  This is a fantastic place, mostly to get takeout or delivery from rather than eating at (the ambiance is lacking a little (but you can't have everything), but the food is always great.  Everything we've eaten here has been good and a few times we've been so lazy or (drank a little too much to drive over there), called in our order and they said they would be over in 30 to 40 minutes.  The doorbell rings 10 minutes later and we wonder who it could be.  Surely not our Chinese food.  How could they even make it that fast let alone drive it over?  But low-and-behold, it is.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for a quick dinner. Great selection and the staff is very nice. Some dishes are very very good but a few just par. As for Chinese food goes, this place I feel beats most."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Living in Dilworth there aren't many delivery options, so I figured what would I have to lose.  $30 got me a small hunan beef, spring roll, an order of steamed dumplings, and shrimp lo mein, with the tip and a $2 delivery fee included.  Unfortunately, the rice didn't make it; I was given credit for a future purchase, along with an excuse regarding my failure to select white rice when placing my entree order (note: do not order through Yelp or you'll get the same run of events).  The beef was tender and legitimate pieces, unlike some other places.  The shrimp lo mein had a significant amount of shrimp, along with zucchini, onions, carrots, and scallions; honestly 1/2 the small is a substantial entree.  
Steamed dumplings weren't great.  They're run of the military frozen, and can tacky , which is to be expected for delivered dumplings (but who is going to tell a 6 year old no?).
All in all, food is decent.  Customer service is tolderable.  Prices are steep for what you get.  You want good Chinese?  Try Great Wall.  You want delivery to Dilworth for a night of movies?  Here's your spot.  
Just remember... follow up with your rice preferences or you'll be suffering an hour's wait live several other customers have had to endure."}
{"text":"We used to love, love, love this place but the pasts few times we've gone in something bad has happened. One time I brought home food and a bell pepper (in the Kung Kao chicken) still had the sticker on it from the grocer! 

I still go, just not nearly as often as we used to and I have to really be craving it enough to not care if they don't clean their produce."}
{"text":"What an absolute disappointment. We decided to order delivery & should have known from the girl on the phone, who told me to call back in five minutes because she was too busy, to her taking my address and then putting someone else on the phone because she was too confused. I had to give my address and order AGAIN!
We ordered the wonton soup, some shrimp rolls, which had not one piece of shrimp and the Happy Family. The Happy Family was an utter disaster. The veggies were so undercooked I think they just took them out of a frozen bag. As for the meats, which included chicken, shrimp, pork, and steak, all frozen and somewhat fatty pieces. 
And, the fried rice, basically white rice with soy sauce dressed on it, not one egg, pea or carrot, something typically found in fried rice. Stay away, not worth the price at all!!"}
{"text":"Gross.  Gross sums it up.  Food is nasty, establishment is filthy.  One time I ordered hot and sour soup and it was freezing cold.  I almost vomited it tasted so bad."}
{"text":"I have to give this place five stars because not only is the food good, but the service is awesome. Some times I don't get the chance to have a hole hour for lunch. On the days that I'm in a hurry I know I can sit down, relax, and enjoy a good meal. After the first 3 or 4 visits, I would come in and they would just ask me if I wanted the Orange Chicken. Now I have to tell them to give me a menu just so I can mix it up a bit. Good food....Fast service....great prices...Great Customer Service....! Good job guys."}
{"text":"When I get a chance to eat here the food is always great. The egg drop soup is very good. The general Tao chicken is awesome too. The sauce they use is great and chicken has nice crust on it."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner through GrubHub.. 
Food. Was. Terrible. No season. No flavor. No salt... Beyond disappointing."}
{"text":"We actually really enjoyed our takeout from Great Wok. We ordered the large veggie curry fried rice to split for takeout a few days ago, took 10 minutes to be ready. I found ordering takeout from here was a little hard because the person who answered the phone could not understand what I wanted. But, despite that. The food was really good, just the right amount of spice and earthiness. It also had a good distribution of veggies and rice, I like more rice than veggies in fried rice. I did think that the portion size was small for a large order that cost $10. Still tasty though. 

Will be back for more, cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice option for a quick meal in Ahwahtukee. Take out was promised hot and ready in ten minutes. General Tso's Chicken had a nice kick of flavor and was delicious."}
{"text":"i don't usually get excited about ordering Chinese take-out, but after I read reviews of Great Wok here on Yelp, I was optimistic. The first time ordered, I was happily surprised by how terrific the food was, and with every subsequent order, I've continued to be pleased with the quality. Plus the delivery staff is always prompt and friendly.  One bit of advice: Do not skip out on the Walnut Shrimp appetizer. Oh, man, it is fantastic (although made with pecans instead of walnuts)!  I can't place an order without that dish. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm housesitting for a friend and Great Wok was on my way \"home.\" I'm very glad that I decided to give them a try. The Kung Pao 2 was awesome!  It has the perfect balance of flavor and spicy heat that I enjoy. My dinner was reasonably priced at $7.95 and my carry-out order was ready in 10 minutes and I was on my way.  I look forward to trying some of their other dishes the next time I'm on this side of town!"}
{"text":"The food is less than average. The menu does not accurately depict what you will be getting. If you are looking for over priced Chinese/Indian/Thai food... Then this is your spot. I've had cheaper and better food that took half the time to deliver."}
{"text":"I was mediocre at best! The best part about Great Wok was the walk to get it and go back to my apparent. I was expecting more than just bland food for my $15.43, for just combination lo mein and steamed dumplings. The dumplings where very small and not very flavorful and I have to say the same about my large combination lo mein. This is the first time I have gotten Chinese food and be able to finish the whole thing. For what they charge to the value you get, it's just not worth it. 


Let's face it this place just churns out food for the people that work near their location and whoever is to tired to cook that night. I have had food here twice and it has been ok at best (that's a stretch) not worth what I have paid. Next time I would rather walk to a different place than get something form Not So Great Wok."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My boyfriend and I were looking for some take out so we gave this place a shot. It was so tasty and fresh. We ordered the beef and broccoli, chicken egg rolls and, Sweet and sour chicken. 

This place definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. It was for sure a hole in the wall. The customer service was great! I really liked the pot stickers and sesame chicken. I wasn't too keen on the egg drop soup, and I wish they had brown rice."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over 10 years and multiple owners - the combination lo mein in terms of quality and portion size is amongst the best in the valley + the hot and sour soup is 2 full meals and a 9 on a scale of 1-10 for both quality and taste - they do great take out business and very nice people that own and run the restaurant very quiet and simple decor can't beat it to eat and relax or read"}
{"text":"This place used to be really fast at delivery. I'm not sure what happened but it takes at least 30 minutes more than what they quote you for delivery now. This is twice now so this is not just a fluke. The won ton soup is good. The egg rolls are good. The rest is average, not fantastic, not terrible. Good enough to satisfy a craving. Really sad the delivery time slowed down."}
{"text":"Dined at Great Wok on Saturday evening after the St. Patrick's Day Bar Crawl.  It was very quiet in the restaurant.  Perhaps J&W was on Spring Break.  I appreciated it location as it was walking distance from my hotel (the Doubletree).

I ordered the General Tso's Tofu. It was well cooked and well seasoned.  Each of the pieces of tofu were coated were in the sauce and the broccoli was good as well.  The rice was a bit under-done for my taste.

The service was fairly quick and friendly.

All in all, I was pleased with my stop at Great Wok."}
