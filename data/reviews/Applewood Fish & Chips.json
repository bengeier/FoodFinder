{"text":"On first impression, I almost turned around and walked out due to the decor and smell of the restaurant. Fortunately the service was very nice and friendly. I ordered the haddock, fries, and coleslaw for $9 and change for takeout. The coleslaw was delicious. Otherwise, everything else seemed overly greasy to me. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! A bit pricey but you do get quality and a decent portion size. I have been going to this place for years but can't say how many as that could age me ;) so if you like halibut and good chips then for sure try this place! But beware of how addictive it can be. Oh and the mushroom caps are kinda mushy just a FYI :)"}
{"text":"This is a great fish and chips place the food and service is great. Very friendly people to serve you and take your order and it being  family owned makes it even better. The food is great tasting and will not dissapoint, great portions and taste for a low price."}
{"text":"So I am in Mississauga on business about 4 times a year, this time I really wanted some good fish and chips.  I was missing Portland where we have great fish and chips at many places, so I looked up a fish and chips place that was close to my work and found Applewood Fish and Chips.  Besides being a hole in the wall place in a small stripmall, there was enough room for about 30 people to sit at tables.  They had either Haddock or Halibut, I choose Halibut with chips for $9.50 and I ordered it to go rather then eating by myself.  Order took only about 5 minutes but was made right on the spot.  The fish was 1 piece piled on top of the chips.  The fish was really good but the chips weren't very good.  The chips were medium in size, somewhere between skinny and steak fries, and were soggy and greasy.  For the price I would have thought I'd get 2 pieces of fish.  The fish's batter was thin, not thick and was flaky which was great.  If I went back I would only get a couple of pieces of fish and no chips."}
{"text":"Great local place for fish n chips! Interior needs an update but the food is quite good! We always get halibut n chips. 
We've been going to this resto since moved in the neighbourhood about 10 years ago. It is a family run business and they are very warm and friendly. T
The only complaint I have is the washroom is in the basement and you have to walk through a weird hall to get there. 
Otherwise it's always a good eat!"}
{"text":"First time after driving by for years, and it was fantastic. The gentleman working there was extremely friendly and helpful, and the fish and chips were on point. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"A good find. My cousin treated my wife and myself to dinner. Quite a casual restaurant. The F&C was good and service is very friendly.

It is a family run restaurant and the service is peppy. The atmosphere was a little smoky; not sure whether the extreamly cold weather affected the vents. Clean restaurant though.

The food was great but, portions were small. The fish batter was not oily which is what I mostly evaluate the fish on. Not much of variety in the menu.

Try it, you might like it."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some fish and chips and luckily there are a number of good ones in my neighborhood.  

I decided to try Applewood Fish and Chips. 

The owner was very friendly and suggested the halibut.  The fish was nicely deep fried and crispy. The fries were good, not the best, but they hit the spot. 

I am going to try a few other spots in my area however I will come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their fried mush room caps & shrimp! Very cute interior design, don't be frightened by the exterior. P.s. Cute and courteous wait staff !"}
{"text":"Such a satisfying meal in a very homey restaurant. My pa and I got the clam and chips we both thought it was delicious my mom got the haddock and chips, she was satisfied as usual with this place. Friendly staff, great prices, decent menu size the only down side is they don't have poutine  which is unfortunate cause their gravy is phenomenal! Love this place and I will continue to come here as long as it's here."}
{"text":"I would say something about the outdated decor but then again, it doesn't matter much. Firstly, make sure you bring cash as they don't accept debit or credit.
I got the 5pc. Haddock special with gravy, fries and coleslaw. It was delicious but overly oily. Tasted fresh and the batter was nice and crunchy. Coleslaw was good as well. The fries were just okay. I was surprised that a specialty fish and chip joint wouldn't make their own tartar sauce. I got little packages! Anywho, service was good, food was great. I'd go back."}
{"text":"When I go to order fish'n chips I do not get the smile treatment like most wasps do here. I always send my wasp husband here, and he gets a better order, by far.
Even one of the young lads, in the last century, asked mockingly at me; and would you like condiments with that order? I said for fun, what's that, and he turned and said to the older lady, see, I told you, and went on to explain with a wide grin.  Unless you are a visible wasp, try your luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"Family run. Delicious fish and chips. Consistent every time. Very friendly. Recommend if you're into fish and chips. Not really any other options. There are chicken fingers on the menu."}
{"text":"I treat myself to Fish & Chips a few times a year, and this is one of my go-to spots. It's family-run and usually pretty busy but my order is always fresh and tasty.
I normally get the Halibut since it's the most popular, and I have never been disappointed. The fries are a bit soggy but if you ask for them well-done (which I love) they are pretty good. I soak them in vinegar anyway so I guess soggy fries aren't a dealbreaker for me :)
The prices are a little steep (about $10 for Halibut & chips, 1pc) but after checking around I think they are comparable to other F&C joints. They do one of my biggest peeves though...cash only, and they don't have an ATM in the store, you have to go to the convenience store down the strip. Wah woh."}
{"text":"Good to fish and chips spot, they have great prices, service, and its family run. Been a customer for many years and plan to continue to visit whenever i get that fish and chips craving. The haddock and halibut are both delicious and the amount of fries you get is generious. Great place! will be back"}
