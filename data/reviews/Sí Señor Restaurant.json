{"text":"One of my two favorite Mexican places in the Chandler/Gilbert area. El Palacio in Gilbert and this are the two I go to most. I argue with myself over which I like more, each time I visit one of them..

Si Senor's has awesome green chili! To be honest, I haven't tried too many of their other items. I had their green chili there my first time a few years back, and when I stop in again I crave it so bad that I just end up ordering it again. I kind of alternate between their spicy green chili and their mild green. My dad likes their red too, I'm just not a fan of red in general. Sometimes their green mild is pretty hot, and sometimes their spicy green is so hot I have tears and snot running down my face (if you like heat, you know this is a good thing). Although when it is that bad, I usually cry all the way home and promise to never get the spicy again. Then a visit or two later I forget and order it again.

Salsas/bean dip/chips are always great. You get a round of sopapillas with honey free at the end of every meal. Love the food and I always have leftovers for later.

The one thing I don't like is it is always very crowded and with a busy place comes noise. Clearly many people also know how good it is, so if you don't get there early it can get loud and the seating is a little too close for my taste in general (but nothing obtrusive). But when it is less busy and you can sit back and enjoy and eat your green chili and cry spicy tears it is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place lived up to all our expectations and more!! Great new Mexican cuisine, just like Richardson's in phx (sadly no longer around). Great sauces, lots of true new mexican style dishes to choose from..and the sopapillas are to die for with cinnamon, sugar AND honey OMG!!! This is what we've been searching for forever! 

The service was great! Our server, Yanai was really friendly, helpful, gave great suggestions and was very attentive!

I had the shredded beef chimi plate with the red sauce and that was,  hands down the best I have EVER had. It was perfectly and lightly seasoned which allows the natural flavor of the beef to come thru as the main attraction. The rice and beans tho are always the true test of a great mexican food restaurant...the verdict is awesome! 

Hubby had the #2 combo plate with all 3 red & green sauces on the side with both red & green chili con carne...everything was amazing!

We are looking forward to many more visits to explore the menu further!!"}
{"text":"Lackluster food, service was passable make sure you read the menu a lot of fine print, I will not be returning. The staff thinks that their restaurant is so good the are arrogant, go to Garcia's instead way better food and better service. If you tell them about your experience there they don't care they just stare at you, the only thing this restaurant is good at is making diarrhea literally. This place used to be really really good going here reminds me of an episode of kitchen nightmares. If you stumble on this place keep driving don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I think I found my favorite mexican food restaurant.  I drive past several mexican food restaurants on my way to Si Señor, and I am happy to do so.  My test as to how much I like the food at a mexican restaurant is how well they do my favorite dish - cheese enchiladas, with rice and beans.  I find it shocking how many mexican food places do that dish poorly;  however, Si Señor did it great!  They serve a variety of salsa and bean dips with the chips, which I really like as well.  They give you a free Sopapilla (a deep fried pastry) at the end of your meal, which is a nice touch, and very delicious.  Interestingly, they catered a recent business event at my place of employment, so I had a chance to try the Chile Relleno a few days ago, which was also very good.  The restaurant is not glamorous, but comfortable and clean.  There is plenty of parking, and the staff seems nice and courteous.  Despite being there on a busy Friday evening, the food was still delivered quickly, and it was delicious!  I will definitely be back for more, and I don't plan on waiting very long before I do.  Please give them a try if you are in the mood for good mexican food.    By the way, it is New Mexican food, rather than Sonoran mexican food, so know that going in - I don't even really know the difference, but that is what they tell me.  I do know that I like it though, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Update:  I have now been back several times, and they have not disappointed me.  Their tacos are very good, and they make them just the way I like.  This is definitely my go-to mexican food restaurant.  If you haven't been, you owe it to yourself to give them a try."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix from las cruces nm . Here in Phoenix the Mexican cuisine is way different hard to find good food . I found out later we had si senor in chandler so had to drive the 40 minutes from westside of town to chandler . Was way worth it good taste the same or maybe even better then original location in cruces . Glad si senor opened in chandler will definitely be driving here at Least twice a week . Good customer service and clean restraunt"}
{"text":"Green chilly burrito plate is awesome and you can ask for extra hot green chilly. Best green chilly I've had in AZ so far. Waitress was quick and attentive. Great job Si Senor."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to downgrade si Senor. The past 3 or 4 times ordering from there, they have either refused, or given pushback when we ask for vegetarian tacos (beans instead of meat). I don't understand why they make such a big deal out of this substitution?
If they offered calabacitas (grilled vegetables) this would improve the menu for me. For now, we'll be thinking twice about ordering from here knowing they are going to hassle us for making substitutions :("}
{"text":"I went here because the reviews were good but I was very disappointment. The atmosphere and the staff were very nice which is where the two stars comes from. However, the food was very bland and I thought it was overpriced. This place was a disgrace for a state that is known for their Mexican food."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place...  Here again for the lunch specials with the boyfriend and daughter... We get the green chili burritos and its always awesome.... Been coming for a while and its been ***** (5 Stars) every time.. Its worth the drive and price."}
{"text":"Their chips and salsa comes with a great variety of dips. Green salsa, red salsa, beans, and jalapeño sour cream. Our server Patricia was very polite. Plus the sopapillas are a great ending to a visit"}
{"text":"This was my number 1 choice for dinner. I loved it. I raved to clients and friends, took out of town friends there, went there for special occasions......And then went back today.... my favorite meal... my ONLY meal (because I loved it so so much) is gone from the menu.  The green chili plate with beef (most restaurants serve with pork) has now been switched to pork. Not a fan so unfortunately I left empty handed. I literally cried. My husband likes a lot of stuff there so I'm sure their other food is delicious but I won't be back. My search will have to resume again for an amazingly tender beef green chili plate."}
{"text":"It's very hard to understand why this place gets good reviews. I've eaten here twice in the last year, and have actually been very disappointed both times. I was dragged along with work mates - not my choice.
If this makes me sound like a food snob then so be it, but I guess I have higher expectations than the other diners.
The first time I ate here, the metal plate they serve food on had dried food that made it look like the plate had not been washed properly. The second time the beans were hard and dry around the edge which made it look like they had been sitting there long before the tacos were added. Whichever explanation is the right one, it's VERY BAD to see dried food on your plate.
When I ate there yesterday the smell of backed up sewer as I approached the bathrooms was pretty bad.
Overall, a terrible dining experience and not cheap either - $10.50 for 3 chicken tacos. Sure it's not expensive, but I expect better quality for that price.

There are way better Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"When you're from New Mexico and missing home, this is the place to go! Delicious bean dips, and excellent price on happy hour margaritas. Enchiladas were amazing, and the red and green chili were both so good!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are AZ natives....so we know (and love) us some good Mexican food.  After moving to Chandler, we looked high and low for a great new Mexican spot....to no avail...until.... Si Senor!  

The food gets 5/5 stars.  But beware: this is not the spot for the faint of tongue.  You MUST like it HOT.  Like sweat-runs-out-of-your-eyes hot.  Like, oh-my-God-I'm-going-to-poop-FIRE hot.  Like wow-this-is-spicy (you get the picture) hot.  

The service varies.  Some of the servers are better than others.  Let me put it simply: you do not go for the service.  The food is what keeps us coming back (chips for 4 types of dip and free sopapillas at the end of every meal- HELLO)!  

And the restaurant itself isn't the most beautiful.  But I'm okay with that.  The prices are great, the food is outta this world, and I'm addicted.  

Si Senor is the bees-knees.  Go.  The food never disappoints."}
{"text":"I am from New Mexico and the original Si Senor is located in Las Cruces NM, and so when I moved here and found out that the same owners also have a Si Senor in Chandler I was pumped, by the way other restaurants claim they are New Mexican style food they are not they are wannabes.

So if you want true New Mexican food this is the place, price wise it is great you get alot of food for pretty cheap.  You get chips and 4 dips to start, the main course and to top it off sopillas for free.  Anything is great on the menu, i love the burrito plate, tasting it brings me back to new mexico.  Also if you love one of the dips you could buy some to take home, the white chili dip is the best dip!"}
{"text":"First time visit, place packed with holiday crowds, not too long of wait. Best red and green pork Chilli I have had in years. Sides ordinary but only so much you can do with rice and beans, home made chips and sauces also very tasty.
Makes me want to start planning trip to New Mexico."}
{"text":"If you want great New Mexico Mexican food...This is the place. Growing up in New Mexico it was hard fro me to get used to the blah Sonoran Mexican food that is served here. The chips and salsa is a meal by itself. Everyone I have brought there loves it and wants to come back. It is New Mexico style so be careful, it's not for the average white folks!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered my favorite plate here. Combo number 1. Always tastes great and it is very good quality food.  Service was helpful and extremely quick on getting the food out to you. A bit disappointed on the regular menu prices. Seems they have went up since I first started going here. Also the sopapillas are great after dinner snacks."}
{"text":"Great food. Definitely reminds me of New Mexico! Green Chile is very spicy."}
{"text":"First off I am from Las Cruces, NM where the original Si Senor is located and the funny thing is, I'm not a fan of that location. I much prefer the location in Chandler. It might be because I haven't found another New Mexican restaurant yet that satisfies my need for enchiladas or gorditas in this area, although I haven't tried looking either. Si Senor pretty much does it for me. The portions are huge so beware. My usual order is the red cheese enchiladas, the chile isn't too hot and has good flavor. The ground beef and shredded beef tacos are excellent. Best part is the sopapillas at the end of the meal, either plain or dusted with cinnamon sugar.

One thing I miss is my usual 23 oz mug of Dos Equis that the LC location has. I could get a bottle but there's something about a giant frosty glass!"}
{"text":"Terrible sanitary condition. Daughters burrito had a bit off nail in it and the General Manager had the nerve to say an I quote \"I'm not entirely sure the nail is ours\". Unbelievable. I will never go to a Dos Gringos again. I will encourage others to do the same!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Si Senor since visiting the Deming NM location a few years back. (If you are out that way I highly recommend it!)

I have been to the Chandler location several times and the food can be hit or miss. Sometimes the flavors are great, and other times just ok. Service is always excellent and the staff are very friendly. 

They always bring out a plate of warm chips and 4 different salsas. Nice!

This past visit (on a Thursday) we ordered the chicken enchiladas (with green salsa) and the chicken fajitas. The food was served hot. The enchiladas, usually smothered with salsa were a little dry and only had a little of their delicious sauce, somewhat lacking in flavor. The fajitas were also lacking in flavor. Maybe a different cook? 

The sopapillas which we always look forward to were warm, but parts of them were hard and crunchy.

I think it was an off night for them.

I rate the food as 3.5 star, and the service 4 star, so overall a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Mediocre with bad service! The green chilies sauce is good but doesn't over come the flavorless chicken or beef. They start you off with chips and a bunch of different salsas. That is truly the highlight. As far as service I was passed in line by three patrons I was clearly ahead of.  Our server was completely disengaged. All the  food and dirty plates are hauled back and forth on the same cart."}
{"text":"Try this restaurant! I moved to AZ 5 years ago and this is still my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Each meal comes with complimentary chips and 4 types of salsa dips. I have never had a bad  thing on the menu. The staff is nice and the atmosphere is great!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for Sunday lunch here -- first timers. 

The place was super busy, but the service was still excellent. 

They bring chips with four salsa options on the table to start with. All four were tasty. It is difficult to stop eating them so... leave room for you HUGE plate of food! 

I ordered one of the combination plates that included taco, rilleno, enchilada, and tamale.  The relleno is delicious!  The taco and enchilada were good, tamale was seasoned well, just spicy enough.  Also included the typical rice and beans. 

The plate itself is a large amount of food, so be prepared for some good leftovers. And when you choose your salsa (red or green), and they ask you mild or hot, be prepared for the \"hot\" to be hot (the kind of hot that works like a slow burn and creeps up on you and suddenly you realize the stuff is burning the inside of your ears... that kind of hot, which I like as long as it doesn't overpower the flavor of the salsa, which in this case, it did not).  Good balance of hot and savory on the salsas. 

They end the meal with a warm sopaipilla, regular or cinnamon & sugar.

Ambience is average, but a good stop for Mexican food to \"hit the spot.\""}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch with the shop. I liked the provided chips and salsa. The chips were warm and seemed home-made. They gave us a warm green chili salsa, cold red salsa, warm bean dip with a meaty ham type flavor, and a white sour cream based cold dip. I love creamy dips so I mostly ate the white one. Our server helped us immediately, which is important when your entire shop is out to lunch (which for us was only 4 people). She brought us drinks and asked to take our order right away. We mostly ordered from the lunch special menu and my Chicken Quesadilla with green chiles was only like $6-7. After eating all those yummy chips I was only able to eat 3 out of 8 of the slices! I have a ton of leftovers.  As an added bonus, they give you a free sopapia at the end. It was fresh and so yummy. I would definitely go here more often if it wasn't so far from our shop."}
{"text":"My family and I went for lunch this weekend and it was fantastic. To start the chips came with four different dips that all had such great flavors: bean, green chile, salsa and a sour cream/ chile combo. 
  I had the chicken burrito combo with the hatch chile sauce, it was really good."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. It's very nice inside and their portions are good and the quality is excellent. Service is outstanding, which is unusual around here. The sopapillas are a nice touch after the meal. I'd highly recommend Si Senor to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely best New Mexican meal in S.E. metri area. Very fresh ingredients, perfect sauces and always cooked just right. Great sopapillas come with every meal."}
{"text":"Delicious chips and salsa, delicious food and yummy sopapillas! My husband and I drive to Phoenix just to go to Si Senor. The service is always great and we always leave happy! We always order the number 1 combination and number 2 and it's plenty of food."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Very authentic New Mexico style food.  The 4 dips are perfect start to your meal.  My cheese enchiladas had the best flavor and the chili rellano breading was perfect.  New \" Go To\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This was great Mexican food at a fair price.  They actually brought a good level of spice (I asked for the \"hot\" green hatch sauce and it delivered).  Nothing super unique that we ordered during this particular lunch visit, sticking with combo plates, but I will definitely try some of their specialties on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is awful!   Disgustingly dirty!!! Used to be a regular customer until I had fruit flies in my food and the managers refused to take it off my bill even though I hadn't even taken a bite. Dirty and poor management and customer service!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best New Mexico-style restaurant in the Valley.  My family and I come here often, and I always try to talk friends into coming with me.  Their red and green chili come in mild or hot.  If you choose hot, please be prepared for HOT.  They only use Hatch chilis, so anything with chili on it is going to have lots of delicious Hatch chili flavor.  My favorite is either the rellenos or the stuffed sopapillas--sopapillas stuffed with your choice of ground beef, shredded beef, or chicken, covered in your choice of red or green sauce and cheese.  I usually go with the delicious marinated chicken and hot green sauce.  Lots of other commenters also commented on the chips and salsa, and those reviewers didn't lie!  The chips and salsa are great!  You could practically just fill up on the chips and salsa and skip the rest of the meal, it is that good!

The service is always quick and the waiters/waitresses are friendly and knowledgeable.  Also, they have a full bar and amazing margaritas.  The food always tastes fresh, you'll never feel like you're getting yesterday's beans and rice.  If you're tired of Manuel's, Serrano's, or Garcia's, definitely give Si Senor a try.  I have NEVER had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"New Mexican food at its finest. I'm a regular here and will continue to be. Great service and awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"I determine whether I like a Mexican restaurant based on two things, the kind of Mexican beer on draft and, chile rellenos. 
By far my favorite Chile Relleno dish I've had.
This place is great. 
I love the variety of choices I get to dip my chips in!
Even the beans and rice are good!!!
Just say Si."}
{"text":"So so food. Had the #1 combo platter and all the different dishes tasted the same. Service was slow like they were short staffed. Our search for a good sit down Mexican restaurant continues...."}
{"text":"NMSU alum, Abq resident for the past 17 years - recently moved here to the valley...   I am spoiled by the above average Mexican restaurants in \"the 505/575\"...  If I could only find one or two of those restaurants here in the Phoenix metro, I would be one happy hombre.  Guess what.?  Si Señor has two locations - Las Cruces and Chandler.!  Southern NM food - CHECK.!!

Food came out a bit on the salty side for me (chx stuffed sopas, red + green \"Christmas\" on top.. Beans and rice..). but was otherwise VERY tasty.  I informed our waitress to reign in the salter a bit - I don't think she understood me though.....

The Hatch green chile is on point.  I cannot emphasize that enough .!!!!   I'm stoked to have a little bit of home 15 minutes away, instead of 5 hours.  :)

Oh yeah - I could eat a bowl of the green chile salsa served with the chips.....  Loved it.!

Wife had the beef flautas, kiddos rocked their favorites - bean and cheese burritos...  Everyone was happy.  Good food, decent margaritas.   Now if only I could convince them to serve RO water instead of straight from the tap, I would say this place is one star shy of Yelp! perfection.  Actually - compared to some of the other \"New Mexican\" restaurants we've tried here, it should be six stars...but I digress...

Service was 15% gratuity territory- average."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service (read the flow of beer was satisfyingly rapid) overall, the green salsa was wonderfully balanced providing a nice amount of heat with an excellent amount of taste. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed in my gorditas as the chicken was slightly dry but otherwise the rice and beans were definitely above par. Unlike some Mexican or New Mexican restaurants I was pretty pleased with the freshness of the ingredients, I didn't see brown lettuce or greenish tomatoes, and while the chicken was disappointing the rest of our dining party was greatly pleased. I will definitely go back to take a stab at the enchiladas or something else that impressed everyone else."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, I come here often to have tried most things. Fast, and good food."}
{"text":"They had good service and good prices. However I was not a huge fan of their food. It is really spicy (and I usually go to Mexican restaurants) and I want all that impressed with the quality. Though if you like super spicy and a lot of sauce this would be a good fit for you."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The food was good. 
FREE SOPAPILLAS!! YAY! YAY!

This is actually the best New Mexican food in the valley."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 4 stars.  I will say the server was friendly and attentive, but the food wasn't memorable.  The chips were stale and the margaritas were too sweet.  My mom ordered the flautas and they were pretty bland.  My husband and I split the chimichanga and it wasn't bad, but not one I would crave in the future.  We likely won't be back as there are other outstanding places in the Valley I would choose."}
{"text":"Average. Nothing to write home about. The chicken was plan, it felt like they just boiled the chicken in water and then shred it. The taco shell was really oily. First time there and it would be the last."}
{"text":"Perfection on a plate!!! Service, food, presentation, and quality are unmatched. Do it!!! You will thank me later...especially when you start sweating from how hot the green chile is! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They have four types of dipping sauces with the chips they serve and they are all fantastic! If you want more then you gotta pay extra but it is worth it. The enchiladas are the best!"}
{"text":"Two of us stopped there based on friends who eat there a lot. We are not big fans of Mexican food, but it was good. They start serving lunch at 10:30, so that was good. The entrees come with a swweet Sopaipilla. Though tasty, I thought there was too much dough. The same for my Flauta, a little too chewey. The presentation of the tortilla chips and dip included 4 choices, the green being quite spicy. I also thought the chips could have been lighter."}
{"text":"The best New Mexico style food in the Valley. I drive 37 miles to get here because it so good. I love the enchilada plate. I get it flat, shredded beef, Hatch green chili, and a fried egg on top."}
{"text":"I have been visiting my mom for 6 years and she finally took me here.  The food was so good I made everyone go back the next day.  

Spicy, crunchy, melty was what I was craving in my pregnancy and this was the cure.  I had a combo plate with spicy red sauce.  It was amazing, I almost cried it was so good.  The enchilada and burrito were perfect.  The chili con carne was delicious.  I am counting the days until I am back in AZ and can go back.  

I have eaten at many mexican restaurants when I visit and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Si Senor used to be family favorite. Haven't been there in almost three years up until today. We were disappointed at how much the quality in service and the quantity of food has declined with increased prices. Not sure if management has changed, but they now charge for every little thing. My mom ordered an iced tea that tasted like dirty dish water and asked for something else to drink. She was charged for a another refillable soft drink instead of changing it out complimentary. My brothers refried beans had a metal taste. When reporting concerns to management all they said was \"sorry\". We will never go back!!! If I did not have to give at least 1 star, I wouldn't but instead give negative stars. The only reason they are getting 1 star is for the sopa which is the only thing going for them."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican restaurant! I am from NM where this restaurant is based out of. It's just as good. The green chile is hot and enchiladas are fantastic. I always get the green chile cheese enchiladas."}
{"text":"Surely not a place I will be dying to go to again.

Server was friendly.. but terrible.  Took forever to get chips and salsa, took a long time for her to take our drink order, she charged me an extra buck for my beer, forgot to bring out my water, my girlfriends diet coke remained empty for most of the meal, and forgot my leftover box until being reminded a few times.  Wasn't that busy... maybe just an off night for her.

Really can't scratch off a place due to a miss on service.  So, onto the food.  So completely overpriced for just your standard Mexican fare.  I had the green chile con carne which was good, but around $9.00 bucks for a small bowl is so completely overpriced.  They give you one serving of chips and then want to charge $3.00 for your second serving.  We didn't finish through our first batch of chips but I still found it a bit tacky.  Couple that with the fact that they charge you $3.00 for plate splitting.  Everywhere you turn on the menu it's telling you, extra charge for this, extra for that, limited refills, no substitutions.  You'd almost get the impression they really don't want you there.  My girlfriend got an enchilada plate which she said was decent, but not fantastic (especially for the price).


I'm sure there are better options in the area to find."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious dips. Good portions and solid Mexican food. Great for families. No complaints- would definitely return!"}
{"text":"So amazing!! Reminds me of the awesome Mexican food I have in Central California :)))"}
{"text":"I haven't found a Mexican restaurant that compares yet. 

Salsas are hot, so be sure you have your water before you indulge. My favorite is the hot green, but they offer 4 varieties of salsas. 

The shredded beef is good. The chicken is always good - all white meat! The ground beef is yummy too, but not my first choice. 

My favorites are the enchiladas, the taco salad and also the tacos. 

A weekly craving! And the best happy hour around, as it is daily from the late afternoon until 7pm."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite New Mexico style food restaurant. My only complaint is I live in Glendale and this place is located in Chandler. Really far to drive to get my favorite  food. Please consider opening  on the west side on Bell Rd. in fact, there are several vacant restaurant buildings calling your name. Your flat enchiladas are the best and I'm craving your sopapillas. People in Chandler and Mesa, try this place!"}
{"text":"45 min wait for food after we placed our order. Food was cold and extremely dry. Also had to move our own chairs and get silver wear for ourselves"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years with great food and great service.  But today you guys really dropped the ball.  My order came out wrong and my wife was done eating before my new plate ever made it to my table."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  Highly recommended!

Si Senor is a bit of a drive for me but well worth it.  I love HOT and spicy food and Si Senor delivers!

They offer a lunch-time special and I usually get the burrito plate (with green chili and ground beef) which comes with beans and rice for a very reasonable price.

Everything is mouthwateringly (is that a word?) good.  And you get a generous supply of chips with two salsas, bean dip and a tasty cheesy dip.

Bonus points:  You never have to ask for a drink refill!  As soon as your glass starts to get to the bottom...you are brought a new one.

Recently, at the end of my meal I was stuffed and my server reminded me that I still had a free sopapilla.

I shouldn't have...but......................

Wow...it was a tasty meal indeed!  : )"}
{"text":"Had the pork green chili plate. It was more a rice and bean plate. The portion of pork and chili was pathetic. I asked the waiter if it looked right and he said yes. There were only 6 tiny pieces of pork."}
{"text":"I am totally in love with this place! It is soooo good. I usually just get a shredded beef chimi, with red sauce and it is very good. 

besides that, I HATE leftovers, but whenever I bring home leftovers from si senior, i always eat it. Their food is still good the second day. 

They also have sopapillas- either regular or cinnamon.  and free chips, with 4 different kinds of dips. I am not a big dip person, but when I took my dad here he loved it! 

The service is also good. :)"}
{"text":"What can i say about si senor.....very good new Mexican style food.... very good red chile sauce... very good green chile sauce and superb sapapillas."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews here on yelp* I just had to try the chips and 4 dips. I liked them all especially the sour cream one with more than a hint of hot, as a matter of fact all 4 were a bit spicey which is something for me since I do like spicey food. Staff was friendly and polite and quick on the refills but was taken aback when I saw the sign that said  \"We give only one extra napkin per a customer\" kinda tripped me out considering they charge 8.95 for guacamole and chips...not cool. I had the Chimichanga plate and my wife had the Cheese Enchiladas both were great and filling, had to stop and make room for the Sopapias and honey. Yeah I'd eat here again. Oh yeah forgot the wife finished everthing off with a Top Shelf Margarita and she said it was good, they didn't skimp on the Tequila."}
{"text":"This place is great ! Not familiar with this area I pulled it up on Yelp . Wait staff was fantastic, gave us suggestions. Both our lunches were plenty of food. Lunch special came with a generous chip basket 4 dipping sauces, beverage , entree, and sopapilla s. All for $15, nice clean place. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the enchilada plate. Both red and green chili sauces. The red tasted good. The green was OK. Wasn't the best but was better than most places I've tried here in phx metro area. Sopapillas were good, they come with the meal. Their not a desert like most Az Mexican restaurants, but honey does come with them. Overall good New Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and it's delicious! New Mexican flare and spicy. Clean and had great service, food came out quick and they gave us chips and salsa(s) while we waited"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago. Combo dinner w/ green chilli.  No draft mex beers. 

OK food just not the kind of Mexican food I like. I like my corn chips covered with salt, hot and greasy, like they just came out of a boiling vat of lard. Theirs were the kind of generic chips you can get anywhere.  Rest of the food was average.

I lucked out and got a very good waitress who checked on my table often. 

The atmosphere was kinda of weird. The painted celling made me think of Aphrodite's palace in \"my big fat Greek wedding\". 

Anyway they got really busy about the time I was leaving so they are doing something right. Just not a place I will make a regular stop."}
{"text":"Great food, really like the green chile burger. ( I know, I order a burger from a Mexican food place, but it's awesome) Also, they bring sopapilla's (sic?) after your meal which are delicious. Service has a tendency to be slow, never got refills, but otherwise a good place to get your grub on."}
{"text":"We like Si Señor for lunch. I think what stands out to me is the little extras you get that I don't see other when going out to other similar places. For example the chips and salsa you get come with 4 kinds of dipping options. Chips are always fresh. The Taco and Enchilada lunch special is 6.95 with drink and a sopaipilla after your meal. Delicious. I really have been satisfied with the service and quality each time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was not a 4 by any means. I give it a 2. The salsa was nothing special. Our beers came out warm and one of the dishes was incorrect. After all this, they took $2 off instead of not charging for the beer and dish. The food was mediocre. I would not visit this place again."}
{"text":"If you are a green chile lover then this place is for you!!!  The food can be spicy but is wonderful.  When you drive up you might be a little unsure because of the location but give this place a try.  The staff is extremely hit or miss.  Some are good others are just plain horrible.  Unless you go for lunch it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I gave Yes Sir a try last night. Would I go there again?....si, senor. I got a take out order, enchilada style beef burro with the green sauce, and a couple of beef gorditas. I'm not sure if the real Mexicanos out there would approve of this place, but me being a god fearing Anglo Saxon of Irish ancestry I found it to be delicious. They even threw in some sopapillas free of charge,  probably because they liked my handsome face. Not sure if they do that for everyone. 

So if you're in the mood for some good Mexican food and you don't wanna spend a bunch of pesos n stuff, go down to si senor."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to to explain how good the food is here! We came a few weeks ago, and my boyfriend wouldn't stop asking when we were coming back. The food is HOT, so be prepared! At the beginning, you get chips with a side of beans, spicy sour cream, red salsa, and green chile salsa... so good! My boyfriend got the Green Chile Plate and it looked and smelled so good. I got the vegetarian plate that comes with a bean taco(totally vegetarian), a cheese enchilada, chile rellano, and rice and beans. You will ALWAYS take food home for leftovers. The service is friendly, they bring your food out on carts, which is kind of weird, but who cares. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you like spicy (New) Mexican food!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic New Mexico food this is the place!  I'm from Silver city New Mexico and I could never find Mexican food here in Arizona. A little piece of home :)"}
{"text":"Fast and nice service, great lunch special prices, quality of food is top notch. Green sauce is the best I've had in Arizona. A must-try!"}
{"text":"Here's how they rate on the 3 items any review needs:

Price:  you'll spend more than you'd expect
Service:  they seem to avoid coming around
Taste:  excellent

My guess is that this place has a dedicated and proud-of-his-work chef, who is surrounded by a lackluster wait staff that looks at the clock and counts down the time that they get to leave.  I bet you'll see them in gossip sessions in the hallways and service areas.

Good Luck."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL! GO HERE! Amazing authentic Mexican food, quick excellent service! We had to be in and out quickly and she completely catered to us in the short amount of time we had! Our server had at least 9 other tables that we saw, but you could never tell by her level of service. She was so friendly and full of great recommendations! Food was fast and Hot. Absolutely delicious! Chips were warm and fresh, salsas all spectacular! We will definitely be back asap!"}
{"text":"My husband and I can't say enough about how much we love Si Senior. More authentic than any Mexican restaurant in the east valley. We often take our out of town company there when the want good Mexican food and when they're back in town again they ask yo go back. The four dips/salsa. Served with fresh chips are always a treat. Each meal includes with sopapias (?) which are hot and delicious. We recommend the green chile - our favorite!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best real mexican food you can get in the valley area.  I used to live across the street from the original one in Las Cruces, NM and this one is exactly the same.

- Great attentive staff
- Food quality is consistent and excellent
- Excellent variety of salsa (and the fact they get their chiles from Hatch, NM)
- Very nice ambiance
- Always seated quickly and plenty of room
- Very reasonable pricing and the amount of food you get for it.  (Salsa = Free, Sopapillas = Free).  

Wish they had another location in north valley.  But it is always worth the trip..never been disappointed.  Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the good cooks must have been off tonight, because the food that I had was very different than what the other reviewers had. 

The chips and various salsas were the best part of the meal.  Knowing that this is a New Mexican restaurant I figured that the green chili pork was the way to go. I ordered the green chili pork combo with hot green chili sauce. I had to ask the server if I ordered the hot sauce e because it was so mild and bland. The server was not interested in the fact the food was bland (no salt and no spices were used in it). 

I will not be returning to this place and I would recommend that you not visit here either."}
{"text":"For what Si Senor is, kind of a combination New Mexican/Mexican restaurant, it's good. Not great, but good. If you have a strong need for a Mexican food \"fix\", Si Senor should fit the bill. I am from Las Cruces originally, home of lots of really good New Mexican restaurants making use of that famous Hatch chile. Based on these other places - Si Senor is in the middle of the pack. Here, it's pretty good. Nice to have the 4 types of salsa offered with chips as soon as you sit down. Always good service. You usually don't have to wait long for the food to appear - indicative of having a good assembly line in the kitchen, with the food in various stages of preparation. Try the stuffed sopapillas for something a little different. Make sure to ask for extra salsa though since they really don't add too much chile to them. Of course, their enchiladas are standard solid fare! We go pretty often!"}
{"text":"New to Yelp, and the first review I made sure to make was on Si Senor.  If you are looking for authentic New Mexican food this is the place.  The mural on their wall of the Organ mtns says it all although most of their employees don't know nothing about the other restaurant in Las Cruces.  The dip trio and chips are so good make sure not to fill up on that alone.  When they say the hot green chili is HOT they mean it.  Hot and flavorfull.  I stick to the basics like enchiladas and tacos so I can't say much more about the rest of their menu.  Also save room for desert when you are treated to sopapillas - plain or with brown sugar!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal and experience here. Had a Margarita and the Chicken Chimichanga, both were great. Service was perfect and the spicy green salsa was terrific. I've been back many, many times now and always consistently good."}
{"text":"We sat close to the wait station and it was very noisy. Our wait person did an amazing job, Disappointed that the food was so hot that you really couldn't taste the flavor of what you were eating. My sister who has eaten there numerous times said that she has never experienced that much spice. I will give it another try. It may just have been the green chile batch that was used for that particular day."}
{"text":"I go here for the Chile Con Carne, it's hot and every meal comes with chips & 4 different salsas, plus sopaipillas... What? No complaints here"}
{"text":"Had their chili Colorado  burrito for lunch.  Excellent.   Can't beat the lunch deal.  Drink comes with meal.  Will definetly  go back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING huge Portions great service and at a reasonable price I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Mexican food huge fan of this place... I've gone there twice now first time during lunch hour service was excellent and if you get the lunch special you get desert along with it 
I had shredded chicken enchilladas with the red sauce I enjoyed the sauce it was perfect not sweet and not overerly spicy became and rice were delish food came fast and hot I loved it!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley!!!  They start you out with a great combination of chips and dips, 4 different kinds and all yum yum.  If you like it hot this is your place.  My favorite plate is Chicken Enchilada plate with Hatch New Mexican Chili.  The real deal.  Owner trucks the chili in from New Mexico.  Family business from New Mexico.  Best seating is in the center room under the sky and don't forget to have a Don Julio Margarita.  Save room for desert they serve you Sopapillas on the house at the end of your meal (AMAZING!) I've tasted many things on the menu, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican chilli! Best lunch specials around with friendly staff. Chips and 4 different salsas are to die for. The green chilli salsa was by far my favorite."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!!!!! We love our Mexican food and this really hit the spot.   Everything was really great.  Service was fast as well.  Our server Patricia didn't miss a beat.  We didn't wait for a thing.  Def 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you want green chile this is your spot! Be sure to ask for the hot green chile if you like it spicy. Great place for anyone who is a fan of New Mexico Mexican cuisine. Can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  My daughter and I like the Relleno.  The chicken chimi is STUFFED w/ chicken.

Don't know if they still charge for additional chips and salsa after the compliementary serving.  They give you 3 different salsas:  green, red and a sour cream with chilis.  Yum."}
{"text":"Moved from California about 3 years ago and finally found a good Mexican restaurant! Too bad the don't do breakfast or menudo."}
{"text":"I just had huevos rancheros with red and green chili, it was great! The only reason I only gave them a 4/5 is because I have only eaten there once."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best green chile con carne in town."}
{"text":"Awesome for foodserviceand atmosphere. Chips with 4 sauces, one better than the next! Oh, my! New Mexico heat - thank you hatch chiles! I'm not eating til Monday! Sopapillas like pillows of pure love with cinnamon on top. If you're smart, you'll get here. And you will become a regular."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for about  15 years. The food reminds my home town in New Mexico.  The staff is super nice.  We can't forget Yolonda we have been going there so long she treats us like family.   Those hatch green chilies makes their dishes outstanding.  Not to say the least how about those sopapilllas with and without sugar.  This place is the best place New Mexican cuisine in Arizona. :)"}
{"text":"My very close friend has been coming here for years. It's one of his family's favorite places for Mexican food. He lives half the year in Denver and half the year in downtown Phoenix. But he will drive all the way out here from Phoenix to get the food from Si Seonor.
So I finally got to join him for lunch at this restaurant.
Wow, what a great experience. The food is absolutely fantastic!!!
Delicious, Fresh, and reasonably priced. Such a good experience. But, go hungry  so you'll be able to enjoy at least a few bites of everything ,fantastic food. 
I got so much food that I had to take half home. That was a full meal in itself.
They bring you chips with a tray full of different types of salsa and bean dip that alone is a meal in itself.

The restaurant is very clean. The service was wonderful.
They are open Monday through Saturday from 10:30 AM to 9 PM. On Sunday they're open from 10:30 AM to 8 PM. Lots of parking in the lot. This place is so worth a try"}
{"text":"Took the family here one night for Mexican food as opposed to any of the \"chain\" restaurants.  Kids enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.

Restaurant, was clean, service was good, food was tasty and sopadillas were enjoyed by all.  

Only detriment was the TV in the dining area, should be in the bar area only. 

Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I have been fortunate to have traveled quite a bit. I love Santa Fe and Taos and get back to those spots as much as possible. This restaurant has identical New Mexico cuisine flavor and preperation.  I had burritos. They have Hatch Chilies I am told are brought in from the farms in Hatch. I believe it! If you are in the mood for simple and delicious New Mexican cuisine this place is IT. Especially if you love Hatch chili!  Lunch crowd on a Tuesday was fierce. Service friendly and sweet.  Nice portions. Taking home leftovers! Prices reasonable. I will be back when I want to taste New Mexico, but cannot take the time to drive. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I am from New Mexico and this is the best New Mexico mexican food I have had here in AZ."}
{"text":"Never never liked Mexican food growing up, until my NM transplanted friend took me here.  No other joint has touched this place in my heart.

--Hatch green sauce, there is nothing like it...
--Chips and 4 dips and sauces, omg.
--Cheese enchilada plate (better than the chicken), chicken tacos or the flautas. omg x2.
--Sopapillas, omg omg omg.  It does not get better than this.

Any out of towner who wants to try (NM) Mexican food, I take them here!"}
{"text":"Any day, any time I will devour some Si Senor! 
I always get their number one with green smoke and it is always on point always spicy and delicious!
Please open one in Gilbert!!!!!! Please you will succeed!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best New Mexican food in the valley!  As a New Mexican transplant, I was so excited to learn about this place.  They even have a picture of the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces - my college town- hanging in the lobby!  The thing anyone from New Mexico misses when they leave  is GREEN CHILE!  If you haven't tried it, I suggest a trip to Si Senor to give it a try- you'll be hooked!  It comes in the hot or mild variety and is so flavorful. I always order the big combo plate so I have left overs for the next day!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! And I'm from New Mexico. I only wish that they would open for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of our favorites. Servixe is good. Their salsas are so yummy and the dishes are authentic  Mexican food, I like to order their enchiladas and my children loove their sopapillas with honey. We came here about once a month."}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico, Hatch specifically. My grandparents live in Deming, where the OG Si Senor is and I've had countless meals there. I now live in Hawaii so I take any chance I can get to have New Mexican food. The place is much like the Las Cruces location, only not quite as fancy. The initial chips and salsa include 4 different types which is always a bonus. I had shredded beef gorditas and they were excellent and the beans of course were also. I'm not a big rice fan, I usually get double beans, and the rice here isn't special so I didn't eat it. When in doubt, order a combo.

I will be back every chance I get since our family is in the area. it's always a good taste of home."}
{"text":"Nice clean place, chips served with 4 dips, man I loved the sour cream jalapeño  dip the most, I ordered the 2 beef burritos with the Christmas salsa (Red and Green salsas) with beans and rice. Let me start by saying it has been a very long time since I had New Mexican cuisine, I used to live in Arizona many moons ago. All I can say is O.M.G. taste explosion,  man I forgot how different this is from Tex-Mex, the hatch red and green chile's were off the chart, and the sopapilla at the end to cool the heat off was a nice touch. Very fast service, we had a nice waitress served my sister and I well. My sister had the 3 enchilada diner with the red salsa, the plates here are huge, she could not finish, me I killed my plate, she agreed the food was excellent,  and scared down on the chips and dips (Bean dip, avocado dip, green salsa and sour cream) all were excellent,  I will come back here when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Super amazing service and loved my enchiladas! The salsa was smiley and not too hot which is always a nice treat. Not too much cilantro either."}
{"text":"Great salsas, loved the green chile, and bean dip.  The hot version of the green chile is HOT but really good.  All of the combination plates were good.  Enjoyed the chile relleno and enchiladas.  Wait time on a friday evening was about 25 min.  Nice place to take the family.  A bit over priced.  Service was nothing special.   I'm spoiled by all the great fast food mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Wow!  Best enchilada sauce I ever had that's not at home. Very good shredded beef tacos.  It's NM style and that means you all get sopaipillas at the end of the meal?  What's not to like?  I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Si Señor, I eat there.
   Dinner for three on a busy Friday night and we were seated quickly and served promptly. I am not saying that they didn't have a line at 8 o'clock. They did. They quickly cleaned and prepped the tables and worked hard to keep the wait to a minimum. They were helped by several large groups that left about the time we arrived and the staff quickly separated the tables and sat people.
   We ordered a round of Coronas's and were presented with the standard basket of chips. This included four choices for dipping; a mild red salsa, bean dip, sour cream with chiles, and a hot green chile salsa. The amount of sauces could have been greater and we were never offered a refill on chips and salsa.
   Almost every item on the menu is served covered with a chile sauce, your choice of hot or mild. I had the two burrito dinner and the Blonde had the chimichanga. Both were seerved with beans and rice. Meals were brought out in a timely manner and well presented. Both dishes were tasty and had the flavor one would expect. 
   I am only giving 4 stars because they give you exactly what you expect from a full service Mexican restaurant, but they do it well.

Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff)
-Excellent staff, helpful, friendly, and well trained.
-Quickly sat on a Friday night.
-Clean, well kept, quiet enough to carry on conversations.

Cold baldies (the not so good stuff)
-Standard Mexican fare.
-Chili sauce on about everything."}
{"text":"Si Senor is pretty good. The best part of the meal is the chips and four different dips at the beginning and then the sopapillas at the end. The food is decent, I've had worse, but I've had better.

The service is always very friendly, it's usually pretty easy to get a table even on the weekends and it's inexpensive. Out of all the Mexican food joints I've tried in the area, this has been the best."}
{"text":"Wow, I wasn't sure what to think after reading the reviews for this place-it seems like you either love it or hate it.....and I think I am stuck in the middle. 

We went here for the other night and there was a wait on a Tuesday night which completely threw me off. Maybe some people on Yelp were wrong and the food is just that good that people will wait awhile? Well, possibly but turns out 2/3 of their dining room was being renovated so they were just seating people in the one that didn't need to have any work done on it. Usually this wouldn't bother me but I had a flight to catch so I wanted the process to be a little quicker. 

Once seated we were greeted and got our fresh chips with four different kinds of salsa and sauces. If you're a free chip hound like me, be prepared to pay for a second or third basket since they charge $2.95 after the first one. One was definitely enough to split between two people. Everything on their menu looked appetizing and I ended up going with the flautas since I didn't want to be that girl on the plane carrying on leftover Mexican food. They were fresh and brought out with a heaping service of refried beans, cheese and rice. I love their presentation of the food-it's laid out on a school lunch like tray and rolled out to you on a random little cart (kind of like a bussers.....hopefully they dont use this for both). There were a lot of bigger groups there, including a birthday party next to us in which one of the kids came up to our table, said \"Muuuuuurdeeeer\" then walked away. Can I get a wtf? 

By the time the sopapillas came out, I could only stomach a bite or two but it was delish!"}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food with a choice of hot or mild green chile sauces all made with Hatch chilies. Lunch specials are a great deal at around $7.50. If you like New Mexican food this is the place, good family atmosphere"}
{"text":"I dream of their green chili  and chile relleno (made from hatch valley chilis - you can really notice the difference)...  Their green salsa is excellent.  The other dishes are pretty standard but good.

The service is also good.  I love how each dish comes with complementary sopapillas - sooo good!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but a little cold by the time we got it.  I had to try and find our waitress because 2 tables that were sat after us got their food before us.  While I understand they were busy, an apology from the waitress would have been nice."}
{"text":"Si Senor is a restaurant on Alma School and Ray Road featuring New Mexico Mexican Cuisine. When you first sit down, they give you a basket full of around 20 chips, a small bowl of red salsa, chunky green salsa,  refried beans and sour cream dip mixed with jalapenos and milk. It has great Mexican music playing in the background. It is a nice building with red tile floors and authentic wooden chairs with sunflowers painted on the back. My friend and I came for lunch. She's also a Yelp reviewer and I am a mostly a Google reviewer but I'm going to post to Yelp as well now. The lunch specials include one drink and 1 sopapilla for dessert and they're mostly price about $7.95. My friend ordered the chili relleno which comes with rice and beans and I ordered the cheese enchiladas and it was supposed to be a beef taco but I don't eat meat so they made it a bean taco which I wasn't that happy with because I would have rather had a tostada but they would not substitute on the lunch menu. We persistently asked our server to give us more red salsa, since it wasn't even two tablespoons per bowl. The server said that they don't like to give a lot of salsa because it goes to waste. We asked for more bowls and they were going to charge us but we said we weren't going to pay. I ordered a red enchilada but instead they brought me green, so I brought that to our server Valerie's attention and instead of giving me a new fresh red enchilada she just came with the red enchilada sauce told me to pour it over the green, which I wasn't too happy with. Our server was pretty much annoyed with us the entire meal. I don't know why. She was a lot more friendly with other customers at other tables. The food is passable, but it's not delicious. It's just your standard Tex Mex, but most Americans would love it if they never tasted authentic New Mexico food from Albuquerque or Santa Fe. Anytime I can eat chips and salsa though, I enjoy the meal. The portions are very generous and I was happy to know that they do not use lard in their beans. All in all, it was a decent experience even though we had to fight for more salsa every step of the way. The sopapillas were delicious and they give you the whole jar of honey to pour on that. We got the cinnamon ones. All in all you'll probably enjoying a nice lunch here with TVs around the walls beautiful pictures and a clean spotless restaurant."}
{"text":"So glad this is still here.  We used to come often but moved to SoCal.  On this trip we stopped back by and WOW as good as ever!  We spent 8 years in New Mexico and this is exact!  No imitation here!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for as long as I can remember! They have the best New Mexican food in the valley so far. The service is always great too. The combo plates are always a win and they have some super great lunch specials so you don't overdue it =) This is also home to one of  my favorite margaritas!"}
{"text":"The Service was good. They have some specials for happy hour. Overall though the quality of the food compared with price was lacking.  Nice, authentic feeling mom and pop place though."}
{"text":"Great Food.
We stopped in on a whim on a bust day.
Seated pretty quick. 
Service was quick. And they were busy.
Food was delicious.
Great chips and salsa with variety of salsas."}
{"text":"This is the most legit New Mexican food place I've found in the Valley. Los Dos Molinos is more popular, but Si Señor's dishes are more traditional New Mex style. Their chile is great. If it doesn't make your face sweat, your nose run, and your eyes water, it's not good chile. I never leave this place disappointed with the heat and flavor of the green and red chile they use. Service is always pretty bad and slow, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"So our whole family has mixed reviews about this place. My husband and I very much dislike the food as do my in-laws, but my parents both love it. I can't do spicy and this is New Mexico style Mexican food, which from what I understand is always spicy. When I ask for food that isn't spicy, I end up getting things that have zero flavor! My husband likes spicy but says that the food doesn't have much flavor other than the \"spicy\" sensation. So I feel a bit like Goldilocks: this food is too bland, this food is too spicy. But nothing is just right. However, the place always seems packed, so obviously there are a lot of people who disagree with me. My husband and I just can't understand it!"}
{"text":"I have to post my experience here. I used to come here for business and take out once in a while. I called on 3/22 and ordered #5 with chicken and double rice, no beans. I opened the box and it was cheese (no chicken) and beans.. I called and let them know. I was told that they would charge my card back $16.25.. 

It is now 4/17 and I have not seen my money back. I have also called and left 8 messages for the manager who is apparently never there, nor does she call people back.. 

I am a member of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce and now everyone there knows my experience. I'm extremely disappointed that I was just lied to and blown off after all the $$ I have spend there in the last 4 years. The food has really gone downhill and my husband never wanted to go because he says its just microwaved food that's marked up 10x.. Maybe this place will go out of business before they fix what's wrong"}
{"text":"the chile rellenos are awesome! -- order it \"rainbow, and you'll get both red and green sauce!"}
{"text":"This is by far my family's favorite restaurant.  The service is always excellent and the food is consistantly outstanding.  My husband and kids love the green sauce (I'm a red sauce girl), their tamales are delicious and enchiladas to die for.  Not the greasy food you get in some Mexican dives.  The refried beans are how I judge any other place I try and none ever stand up to theirs.  The white dip that comes with the chips is crave worthy.  Don't even get me started on the mouth-watering Sopapillas.  Yum!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! New Mexican done right! If you've lived in New Mexico for any length of time, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Green chili is the name of the game and Si Senor does it RIGHT!

Their chili con carne is not to be missed. You really can't go wrong with any of their menu items. But I do recommend the con carne. I could literally live off the stuff!

Visiting Si Senor brings me back home to New Mexico if only for a short time. Absolutely love the place! But with that said, I do have one complaint and I warn all who are planning on visiting this place-

Once you sit down, order and eat your meal something bad will happen... Any other mexican restaurant that you visit in the future will seem less than adequate when compared to Si Senor. Si Senor has tainted my opinion of other establishments - FOREVER. NONE can compare to the fantastic entrees that are served at Si Senor!

You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed in the past my favorite dish at Seniors many times. The visit last week was on a different level.Ordered my favorite dish, paid for it then as I left the restaurant I decided to go back and use the restroom before moving onto my next stop. As I went to the restroom there where two servers cleaning up the plates from my meal. I saw them laughing and saying \" yes the cook put stuff in his food\" I don't want to imaging what was put in my food and have no idea why they would put a foreign \"something \" in it. I do know one thing this is my last visit to this establishment and If there going to keep going down this path then things will catch up to this restaurant. I hope this review will help move this along."}
{"text":"The first thing I have to mention about this place is the chips and dips they serve.  Wow!  I mean WOOOOWWW!!  They bring out hearty chips along with 4, count 'em 4, different dips: red salsa, green salsa, hot bean, and some sort of spicy sour cream dip.  When you go to another Mexican restaurant after eating at Si Senior's, you will be pretty disappointed that they only served you one or two choices of dip with your chips.  

I've been here more than a handful of 10 in a span of ten years.  Every single time, the food was excellent, the place is clean, the atmosphere is cool, and the service is good.

I usually order either the Chili Relleno Plate (green chiles) or the Green Chile Plate.  Both are well made with top notch ingredients.  They even get their chiles from Hatch Valley.  

To top it all off, after your main course, they serve you with a choice of regular or cinnamon sopapillas.  I usually have to give mine up, since my daughters just can't get enough of those.  

Their house-brewed flavored iced tea is very refreshing.  It's the perfect beverage to compliment the dishes they serve, other than margaritas.

As you have read from pretty much all of the reviews about Si Senior, you just can't miss trying the chips and dips.  All of those people just can't be wrong."}
{"text":"My favorite New Mexico food anywhere outside of Albuquerque!!  Nice atmosphere, good service, great food. I love the stuffed sopapilla and we all love the sopapilla for dessert. Don't forget the honey!  

Hint:  if you want a \"normal\" portion go for lunch.  Otherwise they are HUGE. Also, be careful with the salsas as they're all very hot!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like New Mexican food...but this spot is the exception.

Double-down on the warm, green chile salsa.  Put it on everything...you won't be sorry.

Chips/salsa are quite a bit more addicting than most places.  I usually get one of the combo platters as it has a bit of everything and all of them are excellent.  Finish up with a sopapilla (sugar preferred) and you just slammed a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I have been to in this area! The food was amazing. The tortilla chips and dips were the best. I had the chicken fajitas and took quite a bit home with me. They even serve a complementary dessert.

The staff was friendly and helpful. Service was above and beyond!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Mexican place for a sit down meal... if someone were asking me for a local place for Mexican food I would have no problem recommending this place... along with a few other places. 

The street style tacos were good, they serve a variety of salsas with their chips, and the value is decent. The thing is there are a number of places in the area that are as good for Mexican..."}
{"text":"I love love this place! It's not too often you can find really spicy green chile here and it's delicious! The red chile is also fantastic, lately I've been getting the red chile burrito smothered with the hot green chili! Yum! Oh and I love the white salsa also. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"so coming from Texas the bar for decent mexican food is pretty high but Si Señor was on point, service was good, food was very good and the sopapilla at the end was a nice surprise"}
{"text":"Has become my go-to Mexican food joint. The chips with the green sauce and the jalapeño creme sauce. Then the halfy-halfy red/green chili chicken chiminy-Changa followed up promptly with a complimentary hot and fresh sopapilla cinnamon and sugar, or just straight up plain with honey. Damn. I'm going to go tomorrow."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Si Senor for about 10 years now.  I love the fact they use Hatch peppers.  Their sauces are also among the best, and they bring out 4 kinds of sauce (well, one is a hot bean dip) with chips when you sit down to eat.  I noticed they seem to have recently changed their chip recipe to make them more healthy - and I don't like their new chips nearly as much as the old, greasy, salty ones.  Also, their menu prices keep going up fairly often.  Best time to go is lunch and look for the tiny menu usually stuffed in with the tray that has honey, etc.  You can get a great lunch for about 7 dollars (10:30 to 2) and it includes tea or soft drink!  Ordering off the menu, with drink, will cost about double that."}
{"text":"I enjoy the lunch special.  I have tried both the Chimichanga and taco/enchilada plates...both are delicious.   SERVICE IS EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Chandler for 15 years. #8 Red Chile plate is my favorite. I wish the beans were more chunky though. Free chips and salsa. Free sopapillas. The staff is excellent. The restaurant is always clean. Authentic New Mexican not cheap TexMex."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on three different occasions.  The first two times I would have rated them with 3 stars.  This last time I am being generous with 2 stars.

The food was mediocre but the drinks were good. Service was slow.

Our food came out and it was lukewarm. The rice had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. My husband had ordered a chimi and it was soggy. 

I really like the salsa selections with the chips."}
{"text":"Si Señor is an awesome & very reasonably priced spot for lunch. For $7-$8 (not including tax/tip), you get an entree with rice & beans, a drink (soda, iced tea), and a sopapilla for dessert. But to be entirely honest, I would pay that for just the chips & dips that come out first! OK, I am a bit obsessed with chips & salsa/guac/etc. in general, but Si Senor has FOUR different dips, all delicious -- a red salsa, a hot green chile dip, bean dip, and a crema/sour cream dip. 

I went here a few weeks ago with a work group, and I basically took almost all of my \"actual\" lunch home since I went to town on the chips & dips."}
{"text":"Lunch specials!  The problem is the service is SLOOOWWWW!  They use that ridiculous cart system and the waitress makes a pass at all of her tables before getting back to the kitchen.  It is very challenging to eat and get back to work in an hour unless you're on your game and order quick, etc.  Regardless, the food is very good, the hot green salsa is HOT and the chip basket with its four dips is yummy too.  Sometimes they try to charge for the chips or auto-grat you, so watch out.  I still give it a 4 because the lunch specials are so cheap $6.95 or so and include a drink and a sopapilla and rice and beans."}
{"text":"As always, the food and server was great.  Hostess was too busy carrying on a personal conversation to greet people as they walked in.  Asked me 3 times how many in the party after I kept saying 2. Was very distracted. Finally had to tell her she kept asking the same thing."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! We been here before. Great then. But tonight, not so great. We seen our beer on the red cart and soda we knew it was ours, but she stop to take orders in between while our beer mug got warm. It looked frosty at the time it was on the cart. We just one table over. Deliver already !! Everything was slow tonight. Looks like new people. Cleaning crew didn't even pick up the tables too. Not going back !!"}
{"text":"Yuck.  I've been here so many times because my family loves it, but I cringe every time I have to attend a family event here.

Typical overly fried or sauced or cheesed gross generic Mexican food with no flavor or personality.

I've literally tried just about everything on the menu and have been completely underwhelmed.  Now when I have to go there, I just order a plain bean and cheese burrito because it's simple enough to not be flavorless and boring.

The chips and salsa are pretty cool, though I don't care for their red salsa.  The other ones, including the bean and ranch dip, are good though."}
{"text":"I used to love si senior but they have changed their green chili con carne from beef to pork. The overall quality seems pretty low as well. The flavor just isn't as good as it used to be. I would give a 5 star if they changed it back! Salsa is always good and I actually love the chicken stuffed sopapilla but the carne is what I crave! Please change it back!"}
{"text":"This is excellent. Great chile you can taste the hatch valley. My wife is from New Mexico and wanted a taste of home for her birthday. She is all smiles now. Great food and severe. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and loved it every time. It is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in town and I especially enjoyed the enchiladas with green sauce, even though I usually do not like green sauce! The lunch prices are very good, so if it's your first time trying Sí Señor I recommend going during lunch hours. The lunch meals are essentially the same size as the dinner meals for a lower price. Both are worth it, though!"}
{"text":"In Las Cruces, NM this place is a bit mediocre, due to some of the amazing competition there.  

When placed in Phoenix, it blows away much of the competition.  But I miss southern NM food, so I am biased.  

Get the rellenos - green chiles stuffed with cheese and then battered and deep fried.  

Love the salsas and free sopapillas."}
{"text":"Just left this place sfter getting no service... never be back.. what place has all the waitress on break at the same time... dumb"}
{"text":"Being from NM and going to school where this restaurant started (las Cruces, NM) makes me a bit biased but this is a good overall NM place.

Hands down the best part is the salsas and chips they bring out before the meal. One red, one green chile enchilada sauce (warm), one sour cream chile/ jalapeno and one bean dip (warm).

Overall the other food is good with the typical NM fair, nothing outstanding but all good. I like the Gorditas plate.

Interior is Santa Fe style, kinda outdoor feel."}
{"text":"I had a #1 combination with Hatch green chili to go.  It was so much food that I am stuffed and there is still a full meal left.  Everything was delicious and the Hatch chilies give it the right amount of kick.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AWESOME.  Great atmosphere, service (thank you Alex), and the FOOD.  We came here because of the Yelp reviews, and we certainly were not disappointed.  We arrived on a busy Sunday night, the NFL playoffs (Chiefs vs. Steelers) were prominently displayed on two large screen TV's, and there were lots of large parties throughout the restaurant.  Our service never skipped a beat with all of the surrounding large parties...impressive.  We started our experience with two margaritas, and Alex smartly suggested choices from their happy hour menu.  $2.00 margaritas....well, yes please!  The menu here is expansive, and offered many choices of the classic Mexican fare.  We live in San Diego, and have lots of choices when it comes to choosing Mexican food, so when we find a restaurant like Si Senor, we are pleasantly surprised.  My wife had tamales, and I chose the chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  Also, the chips and salsa came with three other dipping choices...a bean dip, spicy red salsa, and super spicy green salsa.  The chips...wow...light, crunchy, just the right amount of sea salt.  Delicious!  With the first margaritas down, we decided to step up our game and selected the Patron Perfect margaritas from the drink menu.  On the rocks with salt of course...and again, we were very happy.  Fish bowl sized came to mind with these huge tankards of Patron tequila, fresh limes and a float of Gran Marnier!!  Time to fire up the Uber app, because these bad boys are bringing on the BUZZ.  Oh...the food.  Delivered quickly and on a really cool red little cart (careful, the plates are hot), our meals were set in front of us and we dug in.  The tortillas that hugged my shredded chicken were the highlight of the meal (well, until the dessert)...light, flavorful, homemade just like my old neighborhood.  You can tell that the food here is made with a true sense of pride.  My rice was steaming, just enough spice, and soft to the mouthful.  The refried beans had a nice layer of melted cheese on top, perfect for a bustling forkful of rice into and back into my pie hole.  The green sauce was packed with plenty of zip, but not enough to pull the fire alarm.  Just spicy enough to let me know it was there.  We finished our meals, and with plates cleared Alex brought out a cinnamon topped treat that looked like little pillows.  I can't remember what this delight was called (two margs down...), but I know several other Yelpers mentioned it.  Wow, what a treat!!  Light, fluffy, and warm to the tongue, this was a really cool end to our fantastic meal.  Four margaritas, two heaping entrees, chips/salsa, and the great dessert...$59.  Not bad for a really nice evening with my wife, great food, and fun atmosphere.  The Steelers stole the game, but Si Senor captured our culinary hearts.  Next time we are in town, we will for sure be back!  Thanks again for the excellent service Alex, we had a blast!!"}
{"text":"Way back in high school Spanish class we learned to conjugate verbs.  So, here goes:   bland, blander, blandest;  boring, more boring, most boring.

The food had poor presentation & the service was mediocre.  My margarita was ordered with no salt and little ice.  It was served with salt and lots of ice.

The taco salad and chimichanga were tasteless. There are no black beans so you are stuck with refried beans. 

Here are some better places to go: Valle Luna-Chandler, Garcia's-Tempe, Macayo's-Tempe, Phx, Chandler.   For fast food, Somburro's is good."}
{"text":"The food was very good but VERY spicy. That is just a personal thing I guess (even though I like spicy food) but other than that it was delicious. The Sopapillas were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for years and I've never had a problem with the food. I could eat those dips they serve with the chips all day long! The reason I'm only giving them a two star review is the fact that while I still eat here I've received consistent poor service from the waitstaff. They just aren't very friendly and our drinks stay empty for far too long even when the restaurant isn't busy. I usually just get take out nowadays if I decide to stop by. I've been on the look out for good Mexican food closer to home."}
{"text":"Work right by there and only ate there once before my family came to town and saw it rated well.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is so good.  First went there for lunch trying to satisfy my sister's pregnant hunger for something melty and spicy.  Much to say it hit the spot so well we were back the next night for dinner.

Both times we needed to wait 15 or so minutes for a table and this is not a small place.  We found out later that it was well worth the wait. The first round of chips and salsa/dip (there are 4 of them!) is complimentary and the next round is $2.95.  The chips and dips were great.  Some spicier than others.  There is a red, a green, a bean (which is not think), and a sour cream.  

Both times, I ordered the combination plate #3 which has a crunchy taco, an enchilada, chile con carne, a tamale, and rice and beans.  There are 3 different chile sauces and I went for red chile both times.  It is the best chile sauce I have ever had.  The refried beans were a little cheesy, really warm, gooey and delicious.  The rice was fantastic and anything the chile sauce touched must have turned to gold.  

The complimentary sopillas were terrific and  hit the sweet spot to finish the dinner so well.  All in all, it is a must go for Mexican food lovers but be warned.  GO HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"We finally visited Si Señor after being encouraged by family members. We were pleased overall by the service, and even more pleased by the food. We will return in the future!"}
{"text":"Ok, first I will admit. I got tired of this place when I was in Las Cruces. The competition for good NEW Mexican food is fierce in Las Cruces, so this was never my first choice. Now that I don't have Mesilla restaurants close by, this is my favorite place. We have tried to find good New Mexican food in Phoenix and some come close, but still just not quite right. Si Senor comes in consistently good and at a fair price. My favorite is the white salsa. I remember visiting the Si Senor Express in Cruces when heading home and getting a quart of this salsa. The green mixed with beans is also very good. The red is sad for me. To wimpy. I like the lunch specials. Just the right portions to make me feel full and NOT over stuff my face! The sopas are also done exceptionally well. I usually get the plain one, but the sugar and cinnamon is a special treat as well."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place Everytime we go but it always starts out terrible, gets okay, then back to terrible. The wait is long during prime time, when not prime it's okay but not sure how the seating chart works. We get the crappy table Everytime. Food and order is good and dessert always good but when the bill comes we seem to have to wait a long time to cash out.  Better luck next time for us, we hope. Lol."}
{"text":"This restaraunt is convienently located right next door to Planned Parenthood. Not that it means anything, but it's a really good place to stuff your fat face with chile rellanos and margaritas when your tests didn't come back the way you wanted. 

Other than that it's pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Since this place is close to home and I love Mexican food, I've tried very hard to like Si Senor's over the years.  Still \"not feeling it.\". The service is always good, ditto for the chips and salsa but the entrees fall short on taste. I know New Mexican style food and this isnt it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  The lunch menu is the traditional items you'd expect at a Mexican food restaurant.  I've also been here for dinner and the food is better for dinner, IMO.  I do like the way the food is New Mexican style here.  Great Red Sauce!

Anyway back to the lunch review..  I love the variety of sauces they bring out with the chips.  There's a simple lunch menu where you can build your own combos or order the traditional \"bundled\" items.  The food was good tasting and good quality, but nothing spectacular.  Again, I think if you ordered the full combo dishes for dinner you get more of what they are famous for. (New Mexico style, great chili rellenos, etc..  

A great treat at the end is the complementary sopapillas!  Very good.

So, why 3 stars and not 4?  The service was friendly but slow and not super attentive.  When i used the restroom there were two large soap dispensers and they were both empty!  This means no soap for customers or employees!  Yuck.  This freaks me out when I find out stuff like this in restaurants and to be out of soap in both containers means no one is paying attention for quite a while.  Opening the door from the inside was a chore too because they were set up with air dry only machines, no paper towels to grab the handle that all those other people who couldn't wash their hands grabbed.  For me this means grabbing some TP and two fingering the door open.  Ok, I'm a little strange, but still..

This place has great potential to be 4-5 stars for me; they just need to give a little more care for the basics."}
{"text":"I'm from Carrizozo, NM and grew up son of a restaurant owner with some serious Mexican food game! I am an enchilada fanatic. Si señor totally gets it! From the acidic red sauce to the Hatch green chile down to the fried egg on top. Can't beat this place. It's my way of visiting my NM \"home\" without leaving Chandler."}
{"text":"The complimentary chips come with 4 dips, a bean, sour cream, salsa, and green chili. Nice touch versus the usual chips and salsa. 
I ordered the chicken fajitas. The rice was a little soggy, but everything else was good."}
{"text":"My husband loves New Mexican food and this place was amazing.  A friend of ours recommended it as she is a New Mexican Native.  We live in AJ but will travel to go here.  Love that they give you sopapillas.   As a previous reviewer mentioned that it is hard to screw up sopapillas.  This is true, but I am a sopapillas connoisseur and  have gone to places where they do screw it up.  I love this place and am so thankful to have a true NM restaurant here in the valley."}
{"text":"The food is a bit too spicy for me.  If you like spice and can stand the heat, you'll want to try this restaurant (salsa, sauces,  green hatch chile, etc.).  Their white salsa tastes like a mix of spicy salsa a day thinned out white quest dip.  After two chips with this salsa, my mouth was on fire.

 I love the chicken quesadillla!  I always request fajita veggies to be added.  Delicious and fresh!   

This visit (1/13) I had the cheese enchiladas plate and it was great!  Although, the \"mild\" green sauce was not exaclty mild.  The cheese crisp was smaller than that of other Mexican restaurants and was not crispy (compared to restaurants like Rositas in Mesa or Nandos in Chandler). The guacamole wasn't my favorite.  Sopapillas with cinamon, sugar and honey are yum-my!  Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I don't typically like Mexican food, but this place was great. The food was good and they offered 4 different salsas with their complementary chips (beware the salsa is hot). The lunch wait was a little long, but all in all good job."}
{"text":"My brother loves this place. 
Apparently on account of the lunch specials. 

The Service was okay. Our poor waitress was about 10 months pregnant, and I hated asking her for anything. They bring your food out on carts which is different, but made me feel better for our waitress. (did I mention she was practically crowning!) 

The chips were stale, when we asked for a fresher batch she said \"they're all from yesterday so they are the same\" - Kudos for your honestly, I suppose. 

The food was... bland, and boring. Even with the 7 dollar price tag, including drink and desert, it was not worth it. 

It's now an ongoing joke any time we go out to eat with my brother, \"Anything but Si Senors\""}
{"text":"La comida es excelente,  las quesadillas de pollo son excelentes,  y las sopapillas dan el toque final."}
{"text":"Love this Mexican food for a dinner out on the weekends,
My husband LOVES hot and they have hot and I like it mild and they have that as well the green chilis are so good I cant even explain to you how good they are.

Real authentic food and not a bad price for good food.
We have five kids under eight and they all love it here lots of food for a small price. The girls favorite is they order a large home made pizza size tortilla with a ton of cheese on it it comes on a metal pizza pan thats how large it is

I think the only issue I do have is they charge for a second basket of chips for $2.95 but were not talking just plain chips and salsa they bring out a basket of chips with 
2 salsas, a bean dip, and a jalapeno ranch dip which is HOT but so good you cant stop eating it..so have plenty of water on the table before you start LOL"}
{"text":"Love the chips and salsa. Never disappointed here even when it's a special day/holiday."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in today for a very late lunch.  Awesome red Chile pork and the wife loved her burrito.  Special patron margaritas were great.  We will be going back"}
{"text":"We love this place! Always consistent and always good. The salsa is amazing and hot! One of our favorite places to eat. And the servers know the food (recipes) very well."}
{"text":"Service was great, but food needed some work. I had the green enchiladas, the sauce was on point. The tortillas seemed little dry/ over cooked. My wife had the gorditas which also were just okay. Rice n beans were very tasty. I would return, to this location only if in area. Nice fix for former New Mexican."}
{"text":"We were hungry for Mexican food and found this place on Yelp.  It quite possibly was the best Mexican place we have been to in AZ"}
{"text":"Si Senor is a family favorite. I always judge a Mexican restaurant by there beans. If you can't get beans right you've already messed up.  The beans are homemade and fresh.  They have a lunch special for 6.99 you get your entree and a drink and a sopapiya. And your meal includes chips and 4 different kinds of dipping sauce. Si Senor is know for the New Mexico chili and they have mild and hot green chili.  If your u sure try it. Its inexpensive and see for yourself. Its a New Mexico cuisine kinda food."}
{"text":"This review is based on several bad experiences with this restaurant. We live in Chandler and started going to this restaurant when they first opened. At first we were impressed with the chips and dips - 3 dip choices was great! But....then things changed.... We went there for dinner and one of the chairs was broken and when my mom moved it out from the table to sit down it pinched her finger to the point that she had to have her finger pryed out from the two pieces of wood and it had crushed her finger so bad that she was crying. You would think that a resturant would be mortified enough to at least comp her meal or appologize! They were not. The second bad experience was the food poisoning that we got from the tamales. Horrible!!! Several months later we tried again and this time we were charged for additional chips and salsa and my daughter asked for a side of salsa that came in a 1/8 cup container and we were charged $1.25 for it!! We mentioned it when we went to pay and they said that they now charge for any extra salsa or chips - period.
You would think that a Mexican restaurant with all the competition they have especially in Chandler would try a little harder for loyal customers. We have moved on and found Mucho Taco - much better food and service!!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, humongous portions & they give you warm cinnamon sugar/plain Sopapillas for dessert which is included in the meal. Service is always hit or miss that why I gave 4's"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  Better than anything else around but menu doesn't offer much of a variety"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious Mexican food. So señor has it all great food and great service and a nice atmosphere. This is the best Mexican food in all of Arizona. If you haven't had this place you are missing out."}
{"text":"A thousand times yes.  Been here a million times and always good. Real live New Mexican style food.  Yum !"}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews, my wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch during a recent trip to the Chandler area. We were seated immediately and drink orders were taken quickly. Like others have noted, the tortilla chips come with 4 dipping options: A warm bean dip, a green chili salsa, a crème dip and a pico. The green salsa was spot on. The classic margarita was decent with definite taste of tequila.

My wife ordered the lunch burrito with chicken with green chili and I ordered the lunch stuffed sopapilla with shredded beef and red chili. The shredded beef in my sopapilla had good texture and decent flavor and the red chili sauce over the sopapilla was outstanding. My wife's burrito was very large and the green chili sauce was excellent. With that said, both platters came accompanied by flavorless yellow rice and canned refried beans. Pretty standard southwestern accompaniments. The mains were definitely 4 star but I wish the restaurant would offer other options then rice and beans.

I'd go back if I visit Chandler again, but I'd go back fro dinner."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. This is some of the best Mexican food in Chandler. They also have a location in New Mexico where they get some of their famous Hatch chiles (a high-grade, sun-dried chile from Hatch Valley) that they use for some of their dishes. They make their own tamales and tortillas in house. Martin and Irene Castillo established the first Si Señor Restaurant in New Mexico in 1984. This location in Chandler opened in 2001 and is a huge local favorite. They always have some great happy hour specials, four dipping sauces to choose from for your chips and a live mariachi band on occasions. The hospitality is always great here and the food is pretty amazing. And of course you can't leave without having some delicious Sopapillas for dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican!  I absolutely love the casual atmosphere and I always order the cheese enchiladas (they actually use real cheese).  They serve Hatch brand products which is top notch.  You know it's good when you see more Mexican Americans than Caucasian Americans!  Not ritzy, but that's what gives it its charm.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant was for lunch. I'm not a big fan of New Mexican food because of the need to really spice up their food but Si Señor impressed me with their fare. I had the lunch combo of a hard shell taco and cheese enchilada. I requested the green sauce served along with the beens and rice. The rice was cooked to perfection- light and fluffy with just the perfect amount of seasoning. The beens tasted fresh and the taco and enchilada were exceptional. Overall a great value served with excellent customer service and the ambiance to match. Overall a wonderful dining experience. Well done and, Si Señor!"}
{"text":"As always I'm not disappointed at all. Went here for lunch and had their lunch special for $7 which included the drink. I had the chili replenish which was actually two large ones along with beans and rice. Mom had the enchilada and taco. Both of us had the hot green chili sauce. Yummy. Of course we filled up on the chips and four types of sauces/dips first. Of course we saved room for the sopapillas. Melt in your mouth goodness topped with plenty of honey. We have enough to for two more meals. Not bad for less than $20."}
{"text":"Yummy New Mexican Food!  Love it! One of our favorite places to eat!  Great Service!!"}
{"text":"Good bean dip, OK chips. OK green chile, although they need a medium green option.  I don't understand why when going from CO closer to Mexico I can't find anywhere with mole sauce?"}
{"text":"Great food and service.   The shredded beef burrito has always been a favorite.   Four different dips for the home made chips are very good.  Lunch specials are priced incredibly cheap."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times, it is New Mexican food.  The chips and salsas are really great.  4 different salsas to dip in.  They make a meal in themselves.  Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been searching all over the valley for NM style food! We made the 40 mile drive over here to meet with some friends because we heard that this was the place to go for NM food. We were seated right away & started with some cocktails which were great. Our server brought out a platter of chips with 4 different dips/salsas, score! I ordered the shredded beef burrito enchilada style which was SOO good. The meat was so flavorful & it was actual green chile! I felt like I was back home in NM :) My husband ordered ground beef gorditas which he loved. Our friend ordered chicken gorditas but they brought out beef & it took a very very long time for him to receive the correct order. We were all finished with our food by the time his arrived.  Our server never apologized for the error, just kinda took the plate & left which is what took my review from a 5 star to a 4. When we were leaving around 12:30pm people were lined up all outside, this place gets pretty busy! Can't wait to come back here for another burrito!"}
{"text":"Great family place! Love the green Chile pork Christmas style (1/2 red & 1/2 green). Nice margarita menu and the sopapillas for dessert hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great Mexican Family Restaurant!!! Our Waitress Valerie Was Awesome and food was hot and delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, the chips and salsa starter is enough to keep me coming back everytime I visit my sister in AZ!!! 

Cant decided red or green chili?!?! Ask for christmas, THEY GIVE YOU BOTH!!!"}
{"text":"Being in the mood for some Mexican food and wanting to try something local and close to where I lived, figured we give this place a try. Service was good place was clean and friendly but food could have been better. I had ordered the Sopapillia plate with ground beef. The Spanish style rice seemed to be more like minute rice with the Spanish seasoning and my Sopapillia fell apart with the ground beef inside reminding me of the ground beef served at Taco Bell or some fast food chain. The ice tea was not good either tasted as if was made from tap water. I managed to make it through the meal while being constantly annoyed at the plates that my meal was served on as it is a hot plate siting inside another holding plate, but as I would eat it would shift out of the holding plate. The plates and the whole experience brought back memories of when I was younger high school/college student and I though Pancho's was great Mexican food. For the price I paid I have had better. You do however get chips and Sopapillia with every meal which were good."}
{"text":"Really good if you aren't watching your weight.  I like the sour cream dip with chips.  Sopapillas are really yummy as well."}
{"text":"The salsa is yummy - I had the green chile cheese enchiladas - so delightful!"}
{"text":"These guys are one of the very few places that offer hot green chili, and they don't use jalapeños to make it hot like lots of places do. If you're a chili head then you'll love the food here. The other nice thing is the sopapilla after the meal. Who doesn't like sopapillas? The best part was lunch for 2 was only $15."}
{"text":"This place is solidly just-okay. Not terrible, will get you full, but certainly not good. Mainly, it's not fresh. Also, it's extremely gringo- like they got all their ingredients from Costco. I think the people who give this place rave reviews have never been to Mexico or had decent Mexican food before. So if you don't really know what you're missing, go here. You won't be disappointed. If you've ever been to Tucson or anywhere south of it, go ahead and skip."}
{"text":"This was a solid outing.  The service was quick and friendly.  The food was really good although the menu was missing some of my favorites.  The one standout was the Green Salsa that came with the chips.  AMAZING!  Great heat and flavor, what a combination.  Trying to go the low carb route so just ditched the chips and ate with a spoon after drizzling across the Fajita plate.  That salsa alone is worth the return trip."}
{"text":"Food was way overpriced for the taste. Beans overcooked. Tortillas seemed stale. Server was horrible. Avoid this place. Dont waste ur $. Sorry bout iiiiit."}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant lives and dies by it's chips and salsa.  If that is a decree you follow,  then Si Senors is alive and well in the East Valley.   Served with four dipping varietals including a refried bean dip, red salsa, green chili & spicy sour cream and hot, fresh tortilla chips, the beginning of this meal hits the spot every time!  One of my favorites is the chicken fajita platter ... the meat is moist, marinated and grilled to perfection. I just wish the margaritas were better ... I've learned to stick with beer, too bad.  Other than that, the food is always muy bien.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Duped, duped, duped! This place had some good aspects, almost enough to overlook the entire rest of the experience, almost. In fact, leaving the restaurant I actually remember feeling pretty good about the meal, but we were duped...

The chip and salsa at the beginning of the meal, and the included dessert at the end, seemed to give us slight amnesia as to the reality of the whole thing.

As we sat in the seat of our car reflecting on the meal we had just consumed, our eyes were opened to the reality that nothing about the meal was even slightly good other than the chips and salsa that had deceived us in the first place.

The actual entrees appeared to be rolled out on a dirty dish cart. Really? You couldn't carry out our food? You couldn't put it on a larger tray? Or maybe even used a different cart, that didn't double as a dirty dish cart that looked like it had been in a school cafeteria? And to top it off our entrees came off the bottom rack... hello, that's usually where half eaten soup bowls and pizza crust go!

Most of the food was soggy, and not all together memorable...not to mention this is less than authentic Mexican food. There were also several small hairs in the food...eyelashes, I think? 

But the worst part of the entire meal was their epic deception and blasphemous betrayal of the sangria. We order a carafe of \"real\" sangria that was rather small for $18, which would have fine except that it reminded us a boxed wine, but we couldn't quite place it...it was not until we got in the car that we realized we'd been duped. The \"real\" sangria, is actually a brand of store bought sangria you can get 1.5 liters of for $10. No wonder it tasted like boxed wine! Are you kitten me! I've never felt so duped and will not make that mistake again.

If you'd like to have a similar experience to this on the cheap, head on over to your local Safeway, pick up a bottle of \"Real Sangria,\" and a couple of deli chimichangas. To make it an authentic \"SÌ Señor\" experience, be sure to ask the deli worker to roll them out on cart for you."}
{"text":"Was the food good her??? SI SENOR!!! Lol! The food here is luh - jit! They start you off with chips 2 salsas, a jalapeño sour cream dip and bean dip. The portions are big and well priced. They end your meal with warm sopapillas. Every table has a bottle of honey to go with the sopapillas. But seriously the food is so f*cking good! The second I walked in, my nose told me the food was gonna be great. The green chile is PHENOMENAL! But you get a choice if red and green, I did half and half. Red chile is bomb too but I'm a green chile kind of person. Anyway, try this place. Once you're done with your meal you'll be so satisfied you'll feel like you shoulda worn a condom. I can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! I can see why they have so many good reviews. I got the ground beef tacos. They were on corn tortillas and were the deep fried kind that are so good. Not like a Taco Bell taco. The cheese enchiladas were nicely sized and served with either green or red sauce. The chips come out with 4 different sauces/salsas. All very spicy. 
We will definately come back!"}
{"text":"My family eats here every Saturday. The past three times, have been disappointing at best. The manager is unprofessional, and doesn't know what she is doing. The food tastes like plastic, and the food is swimming in frying oil, because the oil was never up to temperature. I recommend, going else where. Prices going up, with portions going down."}
{"text":"If you can't handle spicy food, don't even try this place!  The food is spicy but good....and don't forget the sopapillas!"}
{"text":"This was a very good Mexican Restaurant. They had a very good variety of salsa's when they brought out the chips. I was seated right when I walked through the door. The service was really great and friendly. 

I had the ground beef taco's and they tasted amazing. The food arrived within five minutes of me ordering. I felt like i was down in Mexico. This place feels and looks like an authentic Mexican restaurant. The rice and beans were cooked perfection and i could taste the seasoning in the rice. Also, I got red chili and smeared it all over my taco's. It wasn't to hot or to spicy, it was just right. 

If I could go again I would. For that one night I actually thought I was down in Mexico getting some taco's. I would recommend this place to anyone. The culture and the food makes this one of the best Mexican food Restaurant I've ever been too."}
{"text":"I pity the poor folks who don't comprehend New Mexican cuisine. I was turned on to this place by a friend of mine who grew up in Gallup. I asked where the best New Mexican food in Phoenix was and this was one of 3 places he loves. He lives in North Scottsdale, so it's easily an hour round trip with no traffic (since when is there no traffic in Metro Phoenix!) so he readily admitted that that journey doesn't happen very often. He, like me, stops there on the way back from Tucson (easy stop from the freeway) or if he is playing golf in the Chandler, Mesa, Gilbert area.
 
Here you go:
 
The BEST free salsa & chip plate I have ever had. #1 all time. This is worth the stop!
 
Hatch chile rellenos. They don't get any better. I often get 4 or 6 to go after we've eaten.
 
Maragaritas....... as good as they get. If you are driving .... no more than two.
 
Tamales...... none better. Fabulous burritos.
 
Stay away from the Americanized dishes and enjoy the best of Nuevo Mexico.
 
Get the #1 plate & pray you have room for the sopapilla(s). They'll bring you another if you are nice!
 

Just like Tia Stella used to make! Vaya con dios....... you'll be back and back and back."}
{"text":"Tried Si Senor last night for dinner and definitely enjoyed the food! Love how spicy everything is. The chip platter is excellent and we loved the sopapillas after dinner.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"HOT!!! There's little mercy for the tame of tongue here...but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The food is flavorful too. Just use caution when ordering. I've been here a few times, and the service has always been nice and attentive. The dining room is clean and pleasant. And the food is very good...it's just hot too.

The chips they give you when you sit down are served with 4 dipping sauces--all hot. Even the Bean Dip is hot (whaaa?). And the Sour Cream Dip? Hot too. Maybe this is strategic planning to get you to order drinks quick fast in a hurry? I dunno; but the sauces are also good too, so you can't stop dipping. Diabolical!

On the table today: Chicken Enchiladas, Juevos Rancheros, and Ground Beef Tacos. My tacos dish was the only one that wasn't hot. But I love their tacos. They remind me of my granny's tacos (I think I even taste some love cooked into them too). All of our plates were served with beans and rice, which are also not hot. So I had the tamest plate. But the red sauces on the Enchiladas and the Juevos Rancheros = hot. Nevertheless, we were all happy and left full. A good thing.

Overall, I recommend Si Senor. It's not \"typical\" Mexican food (it's supposed to be \"New Mexican\" food I think); but it's good food that will make you happy. Especially if you like it hot...but also if you don't."}
{"text":"Good, authentic New Mexican food.  (Don't confuse this with Mexican... they are NOT the same.)  Very reasonable prices.  Atmosphere a bit on the weak side (primary reason for not getting 5 stars).

Have been to this restaurant at least a dozen times.  Service is usually quite quick. and the servers are always quite nice and polite.   Plenty of variety on the menu.  Drinks are reasonable and good.  Sopapillias for desert every time.  :-)  When they bring the chips and varieties of salsa, be sure to try the bean dip... it is fantastic, as is the green chile salsa.

Solid place, a good stand-by resturant for when you are drawing a blank on where to go."}
{"text":"The burrito platter has a ton of food on it and tastes great. Awesome Hatch Valley Chile too!"}
{"text":"Love coming here to get my New Mexican green chili fix! They have the best green chili! I always get the combo plate at lunch, such a great deal! I love the dips that come at the beginning as well. The sopapillas come at the end complimentary which is always amazing. Yum!"}
{"text":"My co workers and I are obsessed with this place...amazingly quick service, delicious chips and dips--you get 4 different kinds!!  Lunch special is such a bargain...meal with rice, beans, drink and a sopapilla!  Let me have it all the time!"}
{"text":"Had the Chile Rellenos and was really good, Good Food and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the east valley!  Prices are decent.  Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Very good food. I love the atmosphere, the chips and dips they immediately bring to your table. They refill sodas constantly. I try and get there before 2pm and get their lunch deal, which they even honor on weekends. Hmmmm, I'm craving them as I'm writing this. Prices are fair. Great customer service. Terrific family restaurant. I reserve 5 stars for fancier restaurants,  but this comes close."}
{"text":"I'd rather starve. Service is subpar, the front desk staff just glare at you when you walk in. Have the ask to be seated. Then you'll wait another 10 minutes for a server to ask for drinks. 10 minutes later she'll appear with drinks and take your order. 

Food is bland and no flavor. The food here isn't authentic nor is it good. Save yourself the trouble and pass this joint v"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for YEARS and now I know why. The staff is very attentive, which was very refreshing with having a younger waitress she was so prompt and continually checking on us. Wish there was a medium salsa and not the sour cream (I think) dipping sauce with the chips and salsa and thinner chips. My carne tacos were pretty good. Big test was for my other half, he's extremely picky with his wave huevos rancheros and he was very excited while eating his. Was a refreshing New Mexico style he's been searching for since he moved here, and he's Italian so that says a lot!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried New Mexico Mexican Food -you need to check it out ASAP! The food here is amazing, the staff is extremely friendly. We went over the weekend and service was a bit slow - but the House was packed so it's understandable. Chips and salsa are excellent, and the hot sopapillas that come out for dessert are to die for! All around delicious!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  I love the tostado platter.  Sopapillas at end of meal are awesome.  Only thing I would change about this place is the salsa ... They bring a wonderful variety out with chips but they are all very spicy, and the one mild option you can ask for isn't very good."}
{"text":"Started with a complimentary selection of salsas and chips. We came primarily to try the green chile stew, it was very tasty & spicy. Desert was one of their sopapillas and I filled it with lots of honey...yum!
To wash it down, the sangria was great.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always a must when I'm in Phoenix area. The green chili is the best in town. Try the pork, you will not regret It! The complimentary sopapilla is the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials! The lunch specials are massive portions that include both a drink and dessert - sopapillas. The food is so flavorful. You can tell it's quality ingredients. With lunch you lunch you also get chips with 4 different salsas! Really quite a deal. The customer service is always great here."}
{"text":"Delicious, spicy dishes with good flavors.  
Might be too rich but ok once in a while :P"}
{"text":"Delicious! Awesome pork green chili, burritos and enchiladas! Can't beat a warm sopapilla with honey at the end of your meal. YUM!"}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing the food was so good. I had the fajita salad Yum Yum and my husband had the beef  chimichanga super delicious. Our server was absolutely amazing younger female super nice and super super nice."}
{"text":"My parents have gone to the original Si Señor for many years. In 2014 we stopped at the one in Chandler.

It was DELICIOUS! This year we're planning our trip to Reno making sure we go through Chandler just to eat here. I love chili rellenos and they make the best. 

We also got take out chili rellenos from the Si Señor in Los Cruces. Best ever hotel meal in our decades of travel. 

We love Si Señor!"}
{"text":"You know when the rating is still high after so many reviews that the place is doing it right.

Found this place when our new pastor and her husband invited us out for lunch after church one Sunday.  So glad they did.

We loved it from the moment we sat down.  Greeted by several members of the staff.  Felt welcome from the get-go.

After placing our drink orders we had time to peruse the menu while munching on delicious chips and four choices for dipping - love how it is presented.

The first time around, I ordered and enjoyed their chimichanga.  Huge portions and wonderful flavors.

Most recently, when we went back, I had their two burrito plate (one beef and one chicken).  This might be my most favorite plate and my go-to on return visits.  It was so good.

We treated a friend of ours to dinner and he loved his choice which included hatch chili's.  He said he'd definitely return.

Great atmosphere inside.  Plenty of space to sit and relax with family and friends.  I highly recommend Sí Señor's if you are looking for a great spot with great food."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 10 years and this Was my favorite restaurant.  
But on our last visit we noticed they are giving smaller portions of chips and salsas.  Also the food tasted  different (could be because they have 3 new cooks and new manager). The tamale was very  masudo (doughy).  Tacos did not have good taste either. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Get the hash brown breakfast burrito, best thing ever, even better when you're hung over."}
{"text":"Many people don't understand the regional differences in Mexican Food, as with all types of food. New Mexican food is, in my opinion, at a different caliber than Mexican food that is offered in states like Texas, California, and Arizona. Trust me I've lived in each! This is primarily due to Hatch Chile that is grown in Hatch Valley which infuses more flavor than any chile the rest of the southwest is accustomed to. Everyone must experience New Mexican at least once in their life to understand what I mean. If you can't make it over to Albuquerque or Santa Fe then Si Señor is your absolute best bet! 

We come here extremely regularly. Anytime there is a birthday, this is the place (and we have a large Mexican Family so tons of birthdays!) The food is delicious from the flavorful Chile Rellenos to the sweet Sopapillas. Is the restaurant itself memorable? No, we aren't talking about a fancy place, but between the great food and friendly service you will not leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place one of the few Mexican restaurants to offer vegetarians a choice on the menu.  Food is fabulous staff are great busy place!"}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE the chips and dip set up. That green chile salsa is amazing, but packs quite a bit of heat so beware! Seeing as AZ water is disgusting I usually order an iced tea. They serve a really tasty raspberry very lightly sweetened. I absolutely hate overly sweet tea, but their's was perfecto!
The cheese enchiladas are average, cheese, tortilla, sauce. Tacos are pretty good too, but I come hear for the tamales, red chile con carne, and sopaipillas! They're the first Mexican restaurant I've eaten at that doesn't have dry tamales. They are so good! Chile con carne is delicious and tender, falls apart in your mouth. I've only had the red because the green packs a little too much heat for me. The end of meal sopaipillas with cinnamon and sugar are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Very good chips and salsa delivered to start the meal.  2 salsas, a bean dip, and a jalapeno ranch dip  -  and the chips are above decent.  The second batch of chips and salsa will cost you $2.95, however.

But the menu prices are a little high.  Spent $26 on 1 Appetizer, 1 Entree', and two drinks.  Nothing we had was outstanding, compared to other local places.

I'd go back just to make a meal from 2 batches of the chips and salsa, drink water, and get out of there for under $5."}
{"text":"I was craving for that similar Mexican cuisine I had back at Sadies  in Albuquerque.   Had to wait 20 minutes for a table for 5, which was not too bad.  Since my kids only eat sopapilla, I asked if I can order them as appetizers and the waiter said don't worry about it.  So I ordered the:

 #14 Chimichanga  Plate w/ shredded beef, beans & rice (3 stars - beef was too dry, dish looked sad) & a stuff beef sopapillas for my oldest to try.  Since they usually serve the sopapillas at the end of the meal they forgot to bring it out for my kids (not a big deal). The sopapillas were alright (3 stars).

The good: 
- service
- chips & spicy dipping sauce (yummy!)

The bad:
- no fruit in my \"real sangria\"
- my Chimichanga Plate was dry & didn't look that appetizing"}
{"text":"Food was ok. If you are a fan of spice with no flavor. I went here with my family after reading the positive reviews. The best thing that I had was the Margarita, wife and kids enjoyed the chips and dips. The Decor of the place is very nice and the server was very attentive. Just wasn't my \"cup of tea\" when it comes to flavor of the food. I'm an AZ native so maybe it just a NM thing, but I didn't care for the same heat on every item I tried.

Would I return? Probably for just drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"This place was packed, had to only wait 20 mins for a table. The chips and dips we beyond spicy hot. Service was quick and attentive. 10 bucks for 2 chili relanos, expensive. Beers were cold. If you like it super spicy, this is your place! Also the refried beans we beyond delish!"}
{"text":"Starters are chips and 4 dips. The sour cream dip was really good. Food was okay, not too great. It's good if you're in rush and this was the closest place."}
{"text":"After eating at Si Senor on Alama School road in Chandler i was impressed with the quality of food and the flavor. Best Mexican food  in the east valley with a New Mexico touch to the spices . I ordered the Chicken enchiladas which came with rice and beans . I tried the red and green salsa on the enchiladas to compare and the green was new mexico style
yum yum    expect a short wait on weekends as their is always a lineup but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Pros: Awesome chile/salsas, probably the BEST green chile I've had in AZ. Red chile was great as well and so were the dips (with chips). Chile relleno (they use hatch) was awesome and my wife loved the chile con carne (green). Kid had a chicken plate and liked it and she is very picky so food was very good. 4 stars on the food.
Cons: Very slow service even to sit down. We asked for refills and chips a few times before they finally brought them and we are pretty patient. The place is HOT and it seems even worse when eating that spicy hatch chile. All the tables around us were using menus as fans. My michelada came with a nice fly floating right on top when I got it so they gave me a new one. No discount, no next one on the house but it happens. 2 stars on service."}
{"text":"One of our favorites!!!! The 4 dips with your chips and the included dessert really make this place a great value. We grab 2 pacifico's which go best with spicy food. You can tell everything is homemade and fresh. So tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice food and good service.  The foods are better than the food in LA.  Well be back more until we leave AZ."}
{"text":"Was in Chandler for a medical appointment and decided to check out Is Senor. Glad we did. First the server saw us right away, the Margaritas was great, then they bring us chips four three sauces and beans EXCELLENT. So we ordered number #6 Chili Rellenos (two large ones) and the number #3 taco, tamales, red chili, and enchilada. Excellent food!! So hard to find a GREAT Mexican restaurant around Queen Creek. this place is worth the drive. Great services and Great food!!"}
{"text":"what can I say besides this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  Authentic New Mexican food. I get the#1 combo and I try to not eat it all so I have room for the sopapia.  Only complaint is they serve pepsi."}
{"text":"I drove through rush-hour traffic to get here.  It better be good, I'm thinking.  My dad was visiting, and by \"visiting,\" I mean he came to trade a vehicle and visit a friend of his in Chandler.  Somehow I fell into the mix because of a pull-out sofa I guess.  Being a fan of Sonoran Mexican food, rather than New Mexican, I was skeptical.  Admittedly I have limited experience with New Mexican food, but usually I find the meat to be over-seasoned and the chili to be too hot for my taste.  However, these good people in Chandler are from the same small town along the border I am,  so I trusted their taste was similar to mine, and I was not disappointed.

Five stars from the top by serving four different dips with the hot, crisp tortilla chips (green, red, bean, and sour-cream based).  All were spicy, but addictive.  Only the first basket is free, but better than nuthin'  (I'm talking to you Mr. Carlsbad Tavern).  I had the flauta dinner after confirming they are made with corn, not flour tortillas.  Both the beef and the chicken were flavorful, but not overly seasoned.  I really liked the beans as well.  My husband had the chicken gorditas.  The chicken was, unfortunately, really dry.  

It was a Friday night, and in spite of being extremely busy, we had excellent service as well.  Not even knocking off for the dry chicken.  Especially since I wasn't the one eating it.  Would I drive back to Chandler just to eat here?  Probably.  Just not during rush hour.  And why do they call it \"rush-hour.\"  No one was rushing anywhere on the 101.  I am so glad I work from home."}
{"text":"Not the same as I remember since I moved. It not worth the money . I just wanted to know if it is the same as I remember. There no heart or passion in the food. For new Mexico food,  visit the state of New Mexico for the food."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places.. my mother in law always wants to go when she's in town. But today my husband and I went and it's mother's day. We both ordered ice teas we drank both our glasses and when the waitress finally came to give us more, she told us that they changed the free refills to only 2 and then you had to pay an additional .99 to have more. My husband and I both looked at each other and she left. I totally understand that on soda sometimes, but seriously on ice tea!! Come on people I think that's crazy. On top of that most of your cup is ice.. So how much tea are you really getting.. when she came to refill our glasses they were half full still and mostly ice. I think this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great first visit for lunch. Chicken tacos and an enchilada off the lunch menu. We loved everything. The chips and salsas were our appetizer and sopapillas were for dessert. Our server was on it too. We'll be back, for sure. Thank you for the wonderful lunch meal."}
{"text":"I've been going here since the week it opened. The food is better than average, somewhere halfway between authentic Mexican and Americanized.

I love the salsa selections and the chips are good. The food is nothing spectacular but I will go here on occasion just to get decent Mexican food.

Try it, you might like it... many people do."}
{"text":"I'm so torn on this review. Having grown up in New Mexico, I am a huge fan of New Mexican food and research suggests that chile may be addictive so I'm generally grateful to find a place to get my fix in the Valley. 

I had the huevos rancheros, which is two eggs any style over corn tortillas and smothered in red and/or green chile (in New Mexico, we do both and call it \"Christmas.\" i.e. Question: \"Red or Green?\" Answer: \"Christmas\"). It was served with a side of refried beans and rice. (I liked the rice.) 

Si Senor uses the New Mexican red and green chiles but it didn't really scratch the itch, if you know what I mean. (The bean dip was spicier than the \"hot\" green chile. The bean dip was really good, by the way!) 

I just really don't have anything compelling to say about this place. Bottom line, after a 20 mile drive to check them out, I just don't think their chile delivered. 

The chips and salsa plate they start you with was nice. It included a fiery bean dip, green chile, salsa, and a sour cream. And, the fact that you get sopapillas at the end of your meal is a nice memory of my days in NM (but I don't remember ever having the option of a cinnamon and sugar one?!) although the texture of the sopapillas was off. 

I drove a long way to check out Si Senor and, truthfully, I would rather drive back to Albuquerque for some Carne Adovada (not even on Si Senor's menu) than back to Chandler; however, if I was IN Chandler already I would probably give them another visit - you know, research suggests chile is addictive...! I mean, I'm already wondering how I would have felt if I had gotten the stuffed sopapilla..."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place having just had a wonderful meal at Los Dos Molinos.  It was just ok.  Even the decor was uninteresting and had the feel that you would find in a rest home.  I was hoping for more of a homemade taste and unique environment but it ended up being pretty much like 90% of the Mexican food I find--it wasn't a cut above.  The chips and salsa were good and the enchiladas were perfectly fine but not special.  Same can be said for the rice and beans.  The frozen margarita was just plain bad--watery and without flavor.  The sopapillas were excellent.  There are too many better options so I don't think I would be back."}
{"text":"This place has it all....great service, great food and great atmosphere! Very fresh ingredients, authentic and tasty red and green chile to satisfy anyone's craving for New Mexican food. I promise you will not leave there hungry! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Loved the chips served with 4 dips; seasoned sour cream, homemade red salsa, warm hot green chile and beans. Had chicken enchiladas, 1/2 red & 1/2 green sauced , large portions-took one home."}
{"text":"Over priced and under staffed.  The food was mediocre at best and I've eaten A Lot of Mexican food.  

They charge for a side of sour cream, more chips and splitting a plate.  Service was absolutely terrible.  Took forever to get our server to show up to take our drink or, then our food order and to get us our bill and then bring back our card and receipt to sign.  

I will never eat here again and definitely NEVER recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have used \"Si Señor\" numerous times for catering, and they take pride in what they do. I love their salsas, specially the white one, is spicy but delicious!! Excellent atmosphere, the owner Irene, is very humble and wonderful. Yolanda is awesome, she always very friendly and smile.. all the server we have wonderful time. 
I will ALWAYS recommend \"Si Señor\" is very authentic, and the best part is the sopaipillas, my kids love them with honey.
Well done, and next time you read a bad review... it makes me sad, how people is not appreciated of hard working people that serve them, and still they want things for free!!! I hope you go and enjoy the food, and be a repetitive customers like we are!! 
Thank you \"Si Señor\" for always give us excellent service and awesome food!!!
Arlette Lenzi,"}
{"text":"I lived in New Mexico for a few years, so I was happy to hear about this place. I love Hatch green chilli and that is the type of chillis they use. They serve an awesome chip/salsa platter for free!!!! The bean dip rocks. The wait staff was very nice and on top of things.  Don't forget to order a rita."}
{"text":"The food is so authentic and tasty. The salsas are pretty hot but the red is the mildest.  The mild green in the enchiladas is awesome.  They are always busy but services is fast and friendly.  Prices are reasonable and the have some great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico, the food is one thing I really miss!  Si Señor is good, but nothing compares to the real deal.  I love that they have sopapillas!  I just wish they brought out a whole basket with the meal  instead of just one for dessert! I recently made some posole and ordered a dozen to go along with my dinner.  Delicious"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Si Senor tonight on a whim.  We coudn't find the place we were looking for and she wanted Mexican.  Someone had mentioned this place a while back.  Well I'm gonna have to tell this person off!  JK... I can't hold her accountable, she just has horrible taste in Mexican food.

We both ordered  the #1, tamale, relleno, enchilada, taco.  Its all served on one big plate, covered in either red or green sauce.  Oh and a pile of \"chile con carne\".  

If you need to cover the entire plate with tons of sauce something is probably wrong.  You get a large pool of beans covered in... you guessed it - CHEESE! and some mediocre rice.  I wouldn't have minded all this cheese or sauce if what was under it all tasted good.  The relleno was fried to death, greasy and flavorless.  The tamale was ok, but I only had 2 bites.  I think that may have been from your grocers freezer.  The \"beef taco\" was ground beef!  WTF?  Okay, we make these at home because we grew up on a budget and we had to do what we had to do.  But we never called them beef tacos.  WHY? Because beef tacos are SHREDDED BEEF that has been slow roasted or braised with chile and spices.  Ground beef tacos are \"hamburger tacos\".  Ejole!  BUT, again, I wouldn't have minded if it at least had some flavor!  You're killin me smalls!  The beans?  Just fucking sad... brown ooze topped with melted cheese. Clearly from a can. Didn't taste the enchilada cuz I couldn't stomach any more damn sauce and the chile con carne looked like, well...canned.

I do have a couple good things to say:  The chips and salsa were good. I enjoyed the red salsa and the sour cream dip.  Good thing I always get carried away with the chips and salsa or I would've gone home hungry.  The sopapilla at the end of the meal was good.  Fried dough covered in sugar and cinnamon - you can't go wrong.  I have to say, the waitress was really friendly and accommodating.  

My point here is, its okay if you're not the most authentic (and I know everyone's opinion might differ on the way any one dish \"should\" be prepared) as long as you're putting out fresh flavorful food, you're doing okay.  

I hate to write such a bad review, but I have to be honest.  I should have gone to the taco shop down the street on Ray and Warner (Taqueria Mi Casita).  They have real (Mexican) food and I would've saved about half the bill!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona. I would know... I used to live in New Mexico.  I've lived here 15 years, and no one comes close to this specific New Mexican flavor. Treat yourself and come here as soon as possible.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Great salsa with four dips and free sopapillas.  Green chile is amazing!  Also, the happy hour is great and they have a kids menu."}
{"text":"We wound up at si senor after a couple places were closed that we were looking forward to. The yelp reviews were pretty good, so we stopped.  

The service was pretty good, but really slow. I don't know what they would do if they lost their rolling serving carts, seems like they all had one.  

The chips and dips came out after a short wait. They were pretty good.  The chips came with 4 dips: hatch green chile, bean dip, some kind of ranch sour cream, and the salsa.  The salsa wasn't all that great, but the other sauces made up for it. That green chile sauce was great...and hot.

We got 4 different items.  The tacos, I thought were great.  Basic tacos, hard to do badly...They were good.  My wife had a chimi, the meat was really dry but the flavor good.  A friend got a combo plate with a few different items, no complaints there.  Then there were the fajitas...no sizzling plate, not even hot. They came out warm, and the friend eating them said pretty tastless.  

After the meal they brought out sopapillas...these little pillows of fried goodness made the wait worth it.  They were pretty tasty, but the sizes varied a lot and a buddy got the small one, it made him sad.

Over all, it was pretty good, I'd say a solid 4 star.  Pretty basic Mexican food for Arizona."}
{"text":"Had a brunch here with the fam one early Sunday after mass, since they were one of the few places open at 10. The ambiance was okay, a bit homey. I like the cashier counter and the ceiling reminds me of the one in Vegas. Anyway, our server was nice and patient. We didn't know what to get since it was our first time, but her timing was always perfect, not bugging us and not ignoring as well. Their menu was huge, literally huge, but the choices were okay. My dad had the gorditas ( AMAZING), mom had the burritos (not a fan of burritos but this one me likey!!!) and I had the taquitos. We all shared everything, and I didn't like the taquitos that much compared to what my parents had, but nevertheless, it was still great. I had horchata of course. And again, it was so good and refreshing. The dishes were nicely done, very clean. After our meal they serve this hollow breads I forgot what they were called, you're gonna be given a choice between cinnamon and plain, ohhh i love the cinnamon. Over all, I'm inlove with this mex restaurant. HELLA LOT BETTER than Garcia's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in East Valley Phoenix area. They make the best chili rellenos and then they have white salsa dipping sauce for your chips that is to die for. I highly recommend SI senor. They give away with every dinner free sopapillas honey for dipping sauce or you can get them with cinnamon and sugar this place is wonderful, have fun."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food is always good and I have never had a problem with the staff. Their chips and salsas are amazing. I visit here wth my family often and its alway been great."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican restaurant!!  Haven't had good Mexican food in a long time!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome dips. Comes with 4 dips and chips. So hard not to fill up before entree comes. The service is prompt and the entrees are really good. I go for the mild green chili sauce which is super flavorful. My daughter always gets red enchiladas. She and my other kids have always enjoyed the sopapillas that come with the meal. Worth a visit

Their restrooms need updated   I judge restaurants by their restrooms. It's an attention to detail thing."}
{"text":"Wasn't able to try the food, so 1 star is based on the staff. Was coming from a wake and our family called ahead for reservations. The restaurant said they could take us, and when we showed up, they turned us away. After arguing with the hostess, we decided we were just wasting our time. Lady was like Gandalf not letting us pass! We stepped outside of the restaurant. 5 minutes in front of the restaurant, we tried to come up with new plan. The hostess must've wanted her point to get across to us, and flipped the open/closed sign...30 minutes before closing time... If their front of the house is that bad, I can only imagine how the inside is. If you decide to go, give the hostess our best, and hope she's having a wonderful day! She ruined what was already a terrible day for us..."}
{"text":"This is an amazing New Mexican food restaurant. Very good chips and salsa. Great for groups. Always had really good service here. Friendly management. 

The cheese enchiladas are amazing. The best I have had. If you love spice this place is for you. If they tell you something is hot.... It really is. Tacos are really good. The quesidillas with green Chilis are to do for. The hatch green Chilis here can not be beat. 

Great food for a great price.  You have to check this place out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My son and daughter wanted Si Senor's for dinner. We got their about 8pm not many people in the place. Our server was nice and timely with the drink, that was the plus side to my night.  After reading in the menu that the 1st bowl of chips & salsa are on the house, additional bowls will be 3bucks, told the kids this is the only chips they are getting. My daughter ordered the cheese enchilada dinner and it came with 3 huge enchiladas, which she enjoyed, my son ordered the chili rellenos which were also huge in size.  I ordered the shredded beef tacos combo, when I picked my 1st taco up, the filling feel right through breaking my shell, the meat was soggy like it was soaking in water, the other taco feel completely apart as well. The rice was lacking in flavor and the beans tasted like rosarita made them, I wasn't that impressed with the place so No Senor No Mas...."}
{"text":"Meh. We were disappointed. Very mediocre. But the restaurant is very clean and would probably be a great place for a party."}
{"text":"Went there last nigh,a tall Spanish waiter took our order.
I order tacos but wanted flour tortillas,he said no In a very rude manner.when i asked why he said are you going to place a order or not.we all looked at each other and said wow,my friend asked him to smile to break the ice.due to that experienced I would not be returning"}
{"text":"So excited to find his place!  Our new favorite!!!!!  Being from New Mexico, I can honestly say I feel like I'm home!  The sopapillas are amazing, don't forget to save room!  Nachos are a must try!  And I love the green chile, try the hot!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. They have great food, great service, great prices and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chips a 4 kinds of salsa/dips are out if this world! As for tacos, unfortunately, the bean taco was average and the chicken taco was tasteless and NOTHING like the tacos at Si Señor in NM. But I will give them another try so I will go again to try the chiles as my fiance' enjoyed his and they seem to get good reviews."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed all the dipping options for the chip basket. All 4 were so tasty. My green chili pork plate was delicious. Service was great, food came out fast. The only negative I would say is the no substitutions rule. My mom wanted flour tortillas for her tacos instead of the corn and she was told no. I could understand if they only had 1 kind of tortilla but they have both. Kind of a bummer but I'll still be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING food!  I'm a huge fan of New Mexican style food having lived in southern New Mexico for 10 years.  Si Señor has captured the flavors (and heat) I love so much.  The prices are very reasonable and the entree sizes are generous.  My favorite is the red or green chile Enchilada Plate (with an over-easy fried egg on top)!  The Hatch green chile is very hot but has so much flavor it's definitely worth a little pain.  The margaritas are very good and the servers are nice and attentive.  They even finish off every entree with a fresh hot fluffy sopaipilla!  I'm definitely hooked (or maybe addicted?)!"}
{"text":"Was my first time going to this restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised. The chips had 4 different kind of dips, this white one was super good but a tiny but spicy. The lunch special was really good, it was cheap for the amount of food you got! The lunch special included a drink and a dessert which was really good with the coffee we had gotten. Overall good experience and I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great flavor to everything, all tastes fresh and delicious with a nice fiery kick to it all. Price was comparable with other places I've been. Solid service if not a tad quite. But not rude, more just busy. Will come here again as the Arizona Sonoran style is a tad too blah for my liking"}
{"text":"Tried this place because it's one of the few places in Chandler I've never been to.

Great free sopapillas but those are hard to mess up...The free dips that come with the thick chips are spicy salsa, a jalapeno cream sauce, green sauce, and a bean dip that had a weird flavor I couldn't put my finger on.  Regardless of charging 3 dollars for an extra basket, we didn't finish the first basket because we didn't like it. My bill came to 37 dollars for 2 adult entrees and a kids entree. Loved my chicken enchiladas, but my fiance hated his combo meal of hatch chili and cheese enchiladas (they were out of tamales so he had to double enchiladas) and my 4-year-old ordered cheese crisp. Service was OK, a little slow and she pushed a bus tub cart around the whole time to carry things which was a little weird. 

Wouldn't come back with my family, Valle Luna and Abuelos has much better mexican food, less heartburn and service for the price so we'll continue to go there! If I knew it was more expensive and \"New Mexican\" I probably wouldn't have came here, I'm an Arizonan that prefers regular Mexican food."}
{"text":"Awesome service, cool atmosphere and mehhhhokay food. Came here for Sunday brunch and did not have a wait. However, after about 30 minutes into our meal, church let out and a real wait began. Get here early for lunch on Sunday!

The service was solid. Our waitress was quick to refill our drinks and made sure we were good. The decor was appropriate for the theme and ambiance of the restaurant. 

The food was pretty hit or miss. They started off the meal with delicious tortilla chips (not the thin as paper type) and some savory salsa. Definitely better than most restaurants' chips and salsa! Our table ordered a lunch chimichanga, chicken and green chili quesadilla, and a green chili sauce tamale. All mehhhh, but the tamale was not bad. The sopaipillas though... ON FLEEK! Be sure to have a cinnamon-sugar sopa to polish off your meal.

Give it a try; you might like it. It simply was just not my cup of raspberry iced tea."}
{"text":"Great food. My kid remarked on how fast we were seated and how quick the service was. The waitress spared him a nasty burn when he reached for the plate after being told it was hot. She has mom reflexes! Thank you Corina!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Chandler hands down! I'm from New Mexico and the hatch green chili salsa is freakin delicious!"}
{"text":"On my second and last trip I had the worst experience ever in any restaurant that I had ever been at. I did NOT feel welcomed and ladies were not very happy to work or serve me and they had the guts to put hair in my food. Maybe it was a gender problem I guess the don't like men"}
{"text":"Very good! I had the enchilada plate and it was tasty! The amount of salsa they bring you at the beginning is fantastic - i particularly liked the sourcream & onion dip they provided - wow that was a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! From the staff to the setting to the food... friendly, clean, delicious.

I've been here more than a few times. I've brought my son (the only one in my house who handles food spicier than ketchup), my granddaughter (in an attempt to build up her spicy tolerance), and I come by myself... because I love spicy!

The tamales and burritos are probably what I eat most often, and I typically do them Christmas style because I have yet to make a decision between red sauce or green so I just do both. 

They bring me chips and four kinds of salsa before my meal, all of which are fairly spicy. What's funny is because they have unique salsas in the white,  bean, and the hatch chile salsa... I tend to skip the red just because it's more typical. So far, I've only worked my granddaughter up to the bean one... baby steps people! 

Then, after I've stuffed my face, they force me to eat a cinnamon & sugar sopaipilla. Sometimes ya just gotta do what ya gotta do."}
{"text":"| Out-of-Towner Review |
I visit family in Chandler each year for Christmas, but this was our first trip here. The food is excellent. The number 3 combo plate (chili con carne, tamale, taco, enchilada, rice, beans) solved my pregnant wife's crunchy|spicy|melty craving problem she's been having for a few weeks.

The red sauce here is to die for. (This is a New Mexico style place, so you get Hatch Valley chiles as your main pepper ingredient across the board.) It is very, very good and makes the combo plate one of the best things on the menu. You know it's good when the taco is the ranked last on the plate. (And the taco was very good.)

Lunch/dinner combos are served with chips to start (which come with four dips) and sopapillas for desert. Get the cinnamon and sugar ones - they're great.

This place does get busy, so you will wait during peak times."}
{"text":"Horrible place to get tacos ... found a bone in my taco the placed smelled :( ...  my girlfriend didn't even finish her tacos smh .. well this was a disappointment ."}
{"text":"Whoa. We have been coming here for over 10 years. I mean... whoa.

But this restaurant is actually one of the reasons we moved to Arizona. Her sister took us here the very first time we flew out to visit. We were so blown away by this strange place with bright murals on the ceiling and huge wooden chairs - and that was before the chips and 4 salsas came out. And the chile rellenos.

There is nothing outstanding about this restaurant. Except for the fact that for the last ten years, they have been consistently excellent 100% of the time. Who does that? Nobody. This is the only *company*, let alone the only restaurant, that has never let me down, and I go weekly. Is that important to you? If not, keep driving. Maybe there's a Taco Bell in your future.

What else can I say? You won't like every dish, nor should you. But you will crave the ones you do like, and there are many. And during the darkest times of your life, you'll go have an 1800 Margarita (or three) with good company. And you will order extra chips. Lots and lots of extra chips."}
{"text":"My wife and I were seated promptly by a disinterested hostess, but then ignored for 15 minutes. No menus. No waters. No sign of our waiter. Table had no silverware, and was dirty. Also happened to be right next to noisy kitchen doors, so servers were busy coming and going. Place was half empty, however, as it was after the dinner rush. Staff clearly knew we were there and choose to ignore us. Place seemed understaffed. We finally got up and walked out and the hostess said 'Thanks' and to 'Come again,' forgetting she had just seated us. Awful service. Unfortunate, because we've had enjoyable take-out from this place in the past. Food is decent Mexican. Just terrible service."}
{"text":"Si Senor is based out of Las Cruces, NM and serves Authentic New Mexican food. I have lived in New Mexico over half of my life. The Mexican food in New Mexico is simply the greatest. And Las Cruces has the best in NM. Unfortunately I have family in Arizona and the Mexican food that I have had there at several different restaurants has always been absolutely awful. The first sign that a meal is going to the dogs is when we ask if they have \"green chile\" and they look at me confused and say \"What?\". \"Uhm... nevermind you obviously don't\". Try asking any restaurant in the PHX area for red or green chile and they will stare at you with their mouth open... .\"excuse me...\". Our waitress at one of the most popular local PHX restaurants when asked responded, after the \"excuse me... huh...\" part with \"Do you mean chili beans, or do you mean salsa?... Is that what you mean.... salsa?\" 

So, knowing that a Las Cruces restaurant, Si Senor, had opened a restaurant in Chandler, certainly we HAD to try it while we were there. And they did not disappoint. We usually order the #1 combo (Beef tamale, cheese enchilada, chile relleno, taco, chile con carne (red or green - your choice), beans, rice, four different salsas with chips, and sopapillas (NOT \"sopas\" which is \"soups\", a \"sopapilla\" is a puffed fry bread) for less than $13 or so. And I always get it \"green\". Their green chile sauce just tastes so good smothering everything on the plate. Thank you Si Senor soooo much for opening this restaurant ... anyone who is from NM MUST go there when in town for the ONLY edible (New) Mexican food in town!! This was our first visit to this location and it will not be the last. BTW, when we were there the place was packed!! (Probably full of New Mexicans missing some of that awesome food from home!!). My ONLY complaint was that the sopapillas were covered with cinnamon and sugar. Although tasty, I like to use my sopapillas as a \"plate cleaner\"... dipping it in the sauce on the plate (or salsa), and piling on rice and beans and other scraps for a tasty stuffed sopapilla treat. But, at least there were sopapillas which only a rare few in the PHX area have.

FYI: Another reviewer on here states that this is no \"Los Cuates\". Obviously he is from the Northern part of the state where the \"traditional\" NM food is not as good as in the Southern part. \"Los Cuates\" is a terrible restaurant in Albuquerque that does not even come close to Southern NM cuisine. \"Los Cuates\" is, actually at the top of my personal list of the Worst restaurants in the state. I have lived in NM for over 30 years, and Si Senor is easily one of the top 10 \"casual\" (not gourmet) restaurants in NM. And is not a \"poor attempt at New Mexican food\", but is authentic \"New Mexican\" food. I do, however, recommend the green chile over the red chile. Most restaurants tend to specialize in one or the other. With Si Senor, their green is better than their red.
One, reviewer mentions red \"enchilada\" sauce. It is NOT \"enchilada sauce... it is \"chile\" sauce. That is the difference between \"New Mexican\" food and Arizona food. We smother our food with chile sauce... not enchilada sauce. The sauce is made from chile and is used to flavor other foods, not JUST enchiladas. When you order a bowl of \"chile\" you get a soupy chile sauce with chunks of meat and potatoes. This is different from Texas \"chili\" which is a thickened tomato sauce with cumin and other spices, meat and beans. sopa = soup, sopaipilla = fried puff pastry, chile = the fruit of a chile plant or the powder or the sauce made from the fruit, chili =  a thick stew made with tomato sauce - cumin, and or meat and beans - and red chile powder, enchilada sauce = sauce made with chile - and several spices and usually tomato sauce - used in enchiladas.
Si Senor's has four salsas. Red, Green, a Green sour cream, and Chorizo and Bean. The Red is probably the hottest. It is served cold and has red chile, tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic, etc. The Green is not quite as hot as the red but can be quite hot. It is served warm and has green chile, and other ingredients (NOT pork!), the Green sour cream is served cold and is a refresher to cool your mouth off after having the hotter salsas! It has a bit of green chile and a few spices in it. The Chorizo (Spicy Mexican pork sausage) and bean dip, has red chile in the Chorizo, garlic and beans, etc. It is served warm and isn't really very hot tasting. My favorite is the Green salsa, then the \"white\" Green (sour cream salsa), the red, then the Chorizo. 

Down here in the Southern Part of New Mexico, we grow our Chile (chile capital of the World, thankyou), hot and we grow it well. Our food revolves around our chile. If you don't like chile, you won't like our food, period. Chile doesn't have to be hot. But usually, the hotter it is, the more flavor it has."}
{"text":"Outside: big white building in a strip mall. Inside: clean, sunflower/mexican/sedona motif.... but still feels like your inside a big white building in a strip mall. 

Pros: 
-Great chips & sauces. (white baja, green chile, salsa, bean dip came comp w/ first basket o' chips).
-Service... friendly... attentive
-Red chile sauce w/ beef
-Complimentary sopapilla at the end of meal
-Onions & veg were actually caramelized in beef fajitas (ohh sweet)

Cons: 
-Soggy taco shells 
-Ho-hum rice...and tamale.  
 
Good... but not great. If you're in the area and you're in the mood for traditional mexican/new mexican, it'll be worth your while and your $."}
{"text":"Food was okay, my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful... The best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips. But I've still had better"}
{"text":"I like this place alot, and have been numerous times!

I go to lunch here quite often. The food is always consistently good. They do have amazing lunch specials though. I believe lucnh is from 11am-2pm here and they have about 10 options that are under about $7-$10 and are filling.

Service is great as well. This place has alot of seating, however it does get busy around 12 and for good reason. Go around 1:30pm to get your food faster :)

Service 5/5
Restaurant cleanliness 5/5
Food Taste 3.5/5
Value 4/5"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I have been coming here for years and they never disappoint. The free chip assortment with your meal is always a hit. The service is always quick. The food is always done right and you can feed two people really well for less than $30. This is a win.  I can't get enough of the red sauce ontop of my burrito, so I usually get extra. Super smooth, smokey, and a nice slow heat. This place does New Mexican cuisine very well and is worth your time."}
{"text":"The last few months I've been living in Utah and seriously missing good Mexican food. Tonight I got my fix the food was great and the service was as good as the food."}
{"text":"I changed my previous review from two stars to four stars and am adding this update to say that I do not think Kevin works there any longer. We have been back a couple times since the last review and the food and the service was great once again."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are from Cali, but she is originally from New Mexico. I've been several times therefore we're both good on what Authentic New Mexican food should taste like. My friend lives in Phoenix so we were there last weekend to visit. He had never been to Si Señor, but heard several good things. So we went and weren't disappointed. We waited a bit, but soooo worth it. To start of with the chips and dips...yes dips! 4 different dips with a big basket of chips. Bombdiggity. Their hatch chili was on point. Both green and red. I got a chile relleno plate and my wife and friend both got a combination plate. There was more than enough food for leftovers. With the Phoenix area having so many local amazing restaurants this easily makes the top 3. Oh man I almost forgot the sopaipillas.... yoooo don't you dare pass up on those. If you haven't had New Mexican food... take a chance... trust me! 5 stars all day. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican food I've had in many years. Their red  and green chile is amazing. Tamales and chile rellenos  are so tasty. Scottsdale has nothing that comes close to this place. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here but definitely not our last. I have to say I love their chips. The bean dip and salsa were ok ,the green chili dip was fantastic! The kids meals were a great deal since they include a drink . 1 kiddo had the chicken strips and fries , The other had a hamburger and fries . The hamburger was huge , and very tasty ( I had to sneak a bite). The Husband and I both ordered A green chili burrito off the lunch menu $8.49 comes with beans and rice . Again, beans and rice were ok, the green chili was the star of the show for real!  The burritos were full of meat! Portions were generous and service was good. My favorite part was the sopapilla ! I had no idea they give you a free order of hot, fresh fried heaven which is also known by the name of sopapilla. Fantastic. Next time we will try something different and see if we can find a new favorite"}
{"text":"Tried Si Senor for the first time last night. Our experience was just okay. We were seated right away but it took at least ten minutes before our waitress came to our table. Once she had served our drinks service did improve a little bit but it was only so so. The chips are served with four different dipping sauces. One is a hot red salsa, one is a sour cream type of sauce, one is a bean dip and one is like a verde pork sauce that is served hot. I enjoyed the hot red salsa and the sour cream sauce but I didn't care for the verde pork sauce.

I ordered a combination plate which included a cheese enchilada, a crunchy taco, a flauta and chili con carne all smothered in red enchilada sauce. The enchilada sauce was delicious. Spicy and tasted home made. I did enjoy the enchilada very much as well as the crunchy beef taco. My fiancé tried the two bean and cheese burritos smothered in the red enchilada sauce and these were very good as well. The beans here taste very fresh and creamy. The Mexican rice here is also very good. So overall the food was good and I would definitely come back for cheese enchiladas in red sauce. We were also served sopapillas at the end of the meal which were delicious and you can get them covered in cinnamon. Good value for the price.

The reason for three stars is partially because of the service and partially because of the ambiance. I do not mind an older restaurant that is showing some age as long as it is clean and taken care of. The table we were seated at had a big stain of red sauce directly in front of me on the table cloth. I also observed many dusty areas along the hallway leading to the kitchen which always makes me worry. Note to management, just take a little more time to clean at the end of the day it makes a big difference! Other than that pretty good experience. Food is good. Return factor 60%"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican food joints in town.  We've been going here for 4 to 5 years and each time have had a great meal.  The food is consistent and savory.  The atmosphere is somewhat basic but they have a great value for the food served.  

If you like a hotter than average salsa, the green Hatch chili salsa is awesome.  The sopapillas at the end of the meal are always a wonderful treat."}
{"text":"Yummy! This place is wonderful, beside great decorations and a beautiful mural of AZ when you walk in, the food is great. They give you chips and 4 kinds of dip to start. I ordered a traditional green cheese enchilada! It was huge and came with b&r. This place is a jem ! Reasonably priced abs very clean and friendly.5 starts."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my 2 stay review for Si Senior, I have been messaged by a few people with a blanket statement stating, \"I am from New Mexico, so I know what good Mexican food taste like\". I hate to be the beacon of reality but if it tastes like Si Senior, you do not know what good Mexican food tastes like, period. I have encountered this attitude from people from New Mexico before; like they are the authority on Mexican food. B.S!!! Being from New Mexico does not qualify you to discount my experience or be the authority on Mexican food. I have lived in two states that share far more border than New Mexico does (Texas and Arizona) and have encountered far superior authentic Mexican food in Tucson, border towns along the Rio Grande or El Paso; than in New Mexico. I am not sure why people from New Mexico think their opinion is far more valid?? I hold to my review and my palate. In the end, writing a review is your experience, not someone else's."}
{"text":"The warm tortilla chips with 4 different dipping sauces are the best part. One of them was sour cream based with jalapenos and some other spices. It was just delicious. The food was great and margaritas were really good. The only thing is they didnt have a bar area to sit at, so its a complete family restaurant but they do have happy hour. 
Prices are reasonable, waiters are friendly and every meal comes with a warm sopapilla which again was delicious. I was visiting AZ and a coworker recommended this place to me. I'm glad he did. Will definitely visit again when in Arizona."}
{"text":"this could be the best mexican in phoenix.  ironically its New Mexico style.  last time I went it was sat night and we got great service which amazed me because it was so busy.  I LOVE this place.  I always eat too much when I go so I try not to go too often.  The green chili is the best I have ever had.  They have weird hours. seem to close early and very limited hours on sunday twice I think I tried to go but they where close so just remember to check the hours before you head over."}
{"text":"This place was pretty clutch. My girl and I came here for some bomb Mexican food and we found just that! They start you off with a sexy little plate of chips, salsa, a white sour cream sauce (amazing), and some bean dip ( also amazing, especially when mixed with previously mentioned white sauce). We ordered the carne asada quesadillas, which were amazing, although a little on the overly cheesy side. If everything wasn't amazing enough, our entree came with free sopapillas! These come in either cinnamon sugar or plain. Always go cinny-sug. 

Will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm a bit surprised by the number of good reviews.  My experience was far from positive.

Service was terrible.  As the four of us in our party observed, the waitress made a habit of bringing hot food out on a cart from the kitchen, and rather than immediately serve it to the table, she would stop by other tables on the way, takes orders, ask if they needed anything, etc.  This happened multiple times.  Seems to me that should be the other way around.

I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The rest of my party was served their food about 10 minutes before mine.  That is also unacceptable.  They felt bad about eating without me, and I didn't want their food to get cold.  The kitchen needs to learn how to time food so an entire table's order comes out at once.

We had to ask our waitress several times for napkins, silverware, and salsa.

After all of this, the food was sub-par.  My chicken lacked any resemblance of flavor.  The rice and re-fried beans were fine, except for the clearly over-cooked, dried out edges of beans around the plate.  The only person who mostly enjoyed their food had ordered a chicken quesadilla.  At least they can get cheese and tortillas to cook right.

They also charge $2.50 for a second helping of chips and salsa.  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for more chips & salsa.

Overall, being my first Mexican restaurant experience in Arizona, I'm VERY disappointed(come on guys, I can throw a rock to the border.  I expected better!)  

I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"My boss is from New Mexico and is super picky about green chile and has been raving about this place.  I finally went a bit ago and this is definitely one of my new favorite places!  I've been now a total of 3 times in the last month and I think it gets better each time I go.  

First off, the dips that come with the chips are so yummy!  The green chile stuff and the spicy white sauce are my fav.  I am really picky about chicken from restaurants since most chicken ends up being super slimy or fake tasting.  Their chicken is incredible, literally melts in your mouth.  

After your meal everyone gets a sopapilla (sp?) for dessert and those are the icing on the cake.  Just the perfect little treat after a great meal.

I'm so shocked by the bad reviews on here, either those people are crazy or there was something out of the ordinary happening that night."}
{"text":"Honestly this use to be me and my mom's favorite place to go to. We came here a couple days ago and got the chicken tacos. The chicken was SO BLAND and not seasoned at all. It was just boiled and shredded chicken. Very disappointing. I ate one and put the rest to go for my dogs to eat."}
{"text":"For quality and taste of food this place is a solid 5, unfortunately the service lack a bit at my most recent visit and it resulted in luke-warm food and a long dining time frame.  The menu has a good variety and what's included in the dinner is a good value (Beans, Rice, Sopaipillas, Chips and Salsa)

The four Salsa/Dips served with the chips are \"hot\".  I personally enjoyed them all, but  my family had differing opinions.  The sopaipillas were a little dry but drenched in honey they were still a nice treat.

The chicken chimichanga was large and delicious.  Of course the portion size was a little out of control so I was able to take some home for another meal.

The service was the major malfunction of our visit.  As it was Friday, it was busy.  We were seated in about 20 minutes.  We received chips and drinks fairly quickly, however once we ordered our food, it took at least 30 minutes to get it.  Several families who were seated after us received their food before us.  When we finally received our food it wasn't at an ideal temperature.  It was still warm enough to eat, but it did seem like it sat under a warmer for a while.  

Overall, I would recommend Si Senor as the Mexican food served is quite appetizing and well worth it."}
{"text":"Do not let the seemingly gringo name fool you. This place is LEGIT. Green Chile Sauce, Spicy and Smokey Red Sauce, Fluffy Sopapillas, and Homemade Chips and Dips to start it all off! A New Mexican myself born and raised until moving here in August, I NEEDED to find this place. Haven't tried everything on the menu, yet (and I am planning to do so) - but the Si Senior Combination plate smothered in red and green (Christmas Style) is delicious and plenty for a full belly and left overs. The Huevos Rancheros are also very good. The service was kind and very welcoming. The atmosphere is pretty basic (no frills here), but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"We make the drive from Phoenix to Chandler for Si Senor- we love it for lunch! The price is right for lunch specials... for about $7 you get chips and salsa (two salsas, bean dip and sour cream dip) an entree, a beverage and top it all off with a delicious sopaipilla! Plates come out hot and delicious! It's not a fancy place but the service is great and the food has never let us down!"}
{"text":"For lunch you can have a beer and an entree for under 10 bucks. oh and free desert...

Great food, good service. 

Great place.

Does get busy for lunch sometimes."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat Mexican food in the area.  Really do enjoy this place, but beware ... it's hot ... well at least for this white boy.   My favorite are the combo plates.  Every time I go I try to get something different just to see, but one of my favorites is the stuffed Relleno .... but pretty much anything I have had here is amazing.  I also like how you get lots of different salsa's, bean dips etc with the chips.  These guys do it right!"}
{"text":"The don't make their own guacamole. It's pre package wholly guacamole. What a disgrace!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I drive all the way from Tucson just to be able to eat real New Mexican food since nearly all Mexican food restaurants in the Tucson and Phoenix area only serve Sonoran food. I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves red and green chile. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my server Jacob was amazing. I asked about the dishes and he walked me through them along with telling me about the different spice levels of their sauces. I would definitely recommend this as a place to go for great food, drinks and service!"}
{"text":"First time ordering take out, did not get a notification as to when the food would be ready & they never answered the phone when I called about it, therefore the food was cold when we got it home. My tostadas were packed with the rice and beans so soggy. I'm done with Si Senor, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is ok if your in the mood for your food to drip grease. That literally was what my quesadilla does every time I go. Same with the tacos and burritos. Their chips and sopapias are really good though."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday and picked my favorite chile relleno and was charged more than I usually pay. Was pretty sure it was a mistake but didn't notice until I got home and it wasn't a big deal. After coming back today for lunch (that's how much I love this place lol), I immediately noticed the updated lunch menu. Higher prices but now includes drinks. I wish I was given the new instead of outdated menu yesterday (or at least informed by the server) so I could have upgraded my and son's usual order of water for soda if I was paying for it. That said, I still love this place very much."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, we ordered the homemade chips with guacamole and they were the best ever! The only problem we had was not with the food but with the noise, terribly loud. The wait staff uses carts and they are very noisy and since the floor is concrete and tile the noise just bounces off them. This is difficult for conversation, especially if anyone in your group has even a slight hearing problem."}
{"text":"Our family has been going here for a long time.  Love everything here and with s hot hats or Margarita it's even better.  One plus is the soppapillas they include for dessert.  Meal portions are also generous."}
{"text":"I got back in AZ a few days ago and was craving spicy, delicious, savory Mexican food. And since my parent live in Chandler, the place with the best Mexican food yelp rating was Si Senor. I know that Si Senor is actually New Mexican style food, but that was what I was in the mood for... some spicy green chille salsa!

Si Senor has not changed since I lived in AZ three years ago. It still resembles a cafeteria with tables coated in a plastic table cloths, cheap chairs, and tube style tvs hanging in the corners. 

Let me start off my saying the service was OUTSTANDING. Our server was very attentive and made sure that were never needing more drinks. The food also arrived quickly, and piping hot; but, the food was just not that great. My mom's chimichanga and my enchilda were piping hot but dry inside. We needed extra green chilli salsa to get through out entrees.

Oh well! I am glad to see this business is doing so well, and have such an awesome following. Maybe I will be back during my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for over 4 years and only recently discovered this place (too many great Mexican restaurants to choose from!) I've been twice and have enjoyed the food both times. Only giving 4 stars, though, because it's a little pricey for what it is. The sopapillas at the end are a nice touch."}
{"text":"I do recommend this place. The food was really good and the staff was friendly. I would go again. I like the atmosphere and it was clean. I had the enchilada plate and a taco. We left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a New Mexico experience, you're not going to find it at Si Señor. 

This place has been on my bookmarks for over a year now, ever since some Greyhead sent Andrew C. and I hate messages dropping the name of this place for our Carlsbad Tavern reviews. 

Will NEVER understand why people feel the need to do that  . . . 

We stopped in on a Friday night for dinner. 

Seated immediately, and our server was polite and attentive. 

No booze; just two iced teas. 

The chips and salsa came with four types of dips: Bean, Green, Red and some kind of Sour Cream and Green Chile combo (delicious).

Your first bowl of chips is complimentary; additional bowls are $3. 

We ordered: 

#2: Chile Relleno Plate with Both Red and Green Sauce
#14: Beef Chimichanga with Red Sauce 

The Rellenos were soggy, and very little spice.

The Beef Chimichanga was also soggy with unseasoned beef.


Monica O. said the beans tasted like Rosarita; I think Rosarita tastes better than the beans on these plates.

The best part of the meal were the Sopas, but those are pretty tough to mess up to begin with. 

What a bust, skip it. 

Nunca más, Si Señor!"}
{"text":"Holy delicious sopapilla Batman!! The bean dip is fantastic, almost filled me to much for the good good at dinner. Prepare to have you food smothered in delicious sauce!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The beans were good and rice was okay. I ordered a bean burrito enchilada-style. The tortilla tasted store-bought. The enchilada sauce was basically just tomato sauce. I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"There food is so good! I always leave satisfied , it always tastes fresh and the spice is perfect !"}
{"text":"Just get the number 1!  Great meal, decent service and great sopapillas at the end.  We came here after picking out pictures in the same parking lot.  Very casual and the green chili was great, the number 1 has a cheese enchilada, chili relleno, tamale, beans, rice, & a taco.  Chips and salsa are also great!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to eat! I moved here from Colorado 6 years ago and searched for awhile for a great Mexican food place to eat. I give this place 5 stars because it is that good and if your looking for a great place to eat this is it. We always get the #1 and 14. The salsas are the best. Our favorites are the green chili and the sour cream with chili. 
On The weekends you cannot get ahold of them by phone because they are busy. I just walk in and place my order. I have no issues doing that because I know the food is that good to do so."}
{"text":"I just this catered at work. Pretty good food! I'd have to go get their salsa!! Muxed white and red - just right!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely 5 stars, but the service was terrible! At 5:30pm on a Sunday evening, the place was busy, but half the seating was not in use.  Our waitress appeared experienced and competent- at least to her other tables. We waited, but no water, chips, or menus arrived. Finally, the waitress took our drink order and tossed the menus onto the table. My husband was the only one who did get water because he specifically asked for it. I would have ordered two sodas had realized my single diet soda was the only one I would get. Other tables were regularly served off a beverage cart supplied with soda, tea, and            water.                     

The chips, salsas, creama sauce, and bean dip arrived and were delicious but we were out of salsas by the time our  ($9+) assorted appetizer platter arrived. We asked twice for more salsas. By this time, the cheese on half the platter was cold and congealed. I asked for a refill on my soda, please, and the waitress affirmed that she heard me. Then our dinners arrived. My Chili Rellenos arrived without the usual side of tortillas, so I asked for some. Other tables had red containers of small tortillas on their tables. Like my soda refill,  the tortillas never showed up. I resorted to using pieces of the cold cheese crisp. The food itself was delicious--the rellenos were perfect- a combination of hot, gooey cheese, spicy Hatch pepper, and crunchy fried crust. My husbands #3 platter was equally delicious. I let the waitress know it was my husband's birthday, so she said \"oh, congratulations\" and then brought out the bill and the 3 sopapillas (hot, crunchy and delicious) that are part of the standard dinner. 

We sat and watched as our waitress was attentive and helpful to her other tables-- and there were at least 2 other waitresses and a helper in the dining area--so not as short staffed as I thought. The Check  totaled  about $60 for the three of us.  Having worked waiting tables for a living, I realize tips are an important part of a waitress' salary. We usually are very, very good tippers---at least 20%. Not so last night."}
{"text":"Ten Year Customers here in a great neighborhood restaurant. Si Senors goes up and down in quality as they hire and fire their cooks.  Sometimes in just ok and last night was simply amazing.  Their rates keep going upand prices and the little things they do to save money is annoying;  A.) They turn down the air. No A/C in bathrooms.  B.)  Hire waitresses that know how to wait tables C.)  No Paper towels in bathrooms?   Rates are same as Abuelo's and El Zocalo's. Their food is good but cheaping out on the little things make me wonder what things are skimping on that I can't see."}
{"text":"This place has decent food but I am surprised by the people who gave it 4 or 5 star rave reviews. It's not bad, but it's nothing special either. 

I went in on Sunday for a late lunch with 3 other people. We all liked our food but agreed that it was pretty much the same as any other Mexican restaurant. I was a little disappointed since the menu did not have a lot of choices and what was there was pretty basic. One of the people at the table ordered the combo plate they were told that they were out of tamales so she had to sub another taco. So, the four of us got chicken rolled taquitos, beef fajitas, carne con chile, and tacos. Wow, real exciting stuff. 

The pluses for this place are the variety of salsa that come with chips before the meal and the free sopapillas. Again, nothing really wowed my taste buds, but both were a nice touch. 

The waitress was very friendly but the service was spotty. She refilled our drinks before they were even empty but failed to notice that we did not have napkins or silverware until we pointed it out to her... after our meals had been brought out. 

Overall I didn't hate it; but I will not be back again since there are other Mexican joints closer to my house that have the same boring food so it really is not worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I absolutely love the bean dip. The food is pretty good and I usually have great service however my reason today for reviewing si señor 3 stars is due to the fact that multiple times when I have come in 30+ min before close they have told me they were closed. I was especially upset tonight as I drove 30 min to dine here and was told they were closing early. When I stated the hours of business the woman at the front desk advised me they were closing early so they could get their cleaning done. It's Saturday night and they closed at 8:30. Pretty upset."}
{"text":"The first thing that irked is the nickel and diming of the chips and salsa. Not cool. Ya I get it that everyone isn't a fatty like my girlfriend and I are when it comes to chips and salsa. That's fine. For the people who love chips and salsa like us though charging extra for more chips and salsa is BS. The main reason why it makes no sense is because they are the only restaurant doing that. The outside of the restaurant isn't very appealing but once you are in it isn't too bad. I was not a fan of the tables and how crammed they have you with everyone else in the restaurant. They have been around forever.  Invest in some booths. The food is what is giving this restaurant high reviews and I agree with that. The food was good. The different salsas and green chili were good. This restaurant has a lot of potential because of their food, but that's not enough to bring me back I'm afraid."}
{"text":"The food was average quality and the prices were  ver good. Starting with the chips and salsa. They were just ok, the chips definitely did not taste like they were made fresh. The 4 different salsas was a cool idea, but again, they were just ok. The shredded chicken and shredded beef burrito meal was a nice amount of food, but the meat seemed to be underseasoned.  The refried beans were average and the rice was below avaerage.The atmosphere was very generic. Very \"strip plaza\" Mexican restaurant like, no authenticity in the decor at all. The waitress did a great job, she was friendly and attentive. Not sure I would visit the restaurant again."}
{"text":"As several Yelpers have mentioned,  Si Senor is getting stingy with their chips and salsa,  which was a welcome and unique start to a meal there.  I eat lunch at Si Senor once a week on average,  and this apparent cost cutting measure has not gone unnoticed.  I seldom use more than a couple of the salsas anyway.  It would be nice if they could give you more of what you want and then you wouldn't be wasting what you don't want.  I understand the waste issue,  but don't sacrifice the best complimentary chips and salsas in the valley to fix the problem. The food is still good and the service is usually excellent. You can't beat their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Spicy food - loved the soapillas!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is one of favorite places for New Mexico style Mexican food. They have good size portions of authentic Mexican favorites at reasonable prices. I love their enchiladas and sopapillas. I also love the atmosphere. It's very relaxed and welcoming."}
{"text":"This used to be our Friday lunch hangout destination. 
I am not going to vouch for any of their entrees being exceptional or memorable. But saying their green nopal salsa is out of the world, would be an understatement. Creamy with a mild kick, just perfect. Most of our appetite would be satisfied eating chips and their green wonder sauce. Ordering Entrees was just namesake. If you like both red and green salsa, you can get their Christmas combination of sauces. Most of the entrees come with free sopapillas. Eat them with a drizzle of honey, and you are in heaven!

Also don't forget to carry $1 dollar bills (4 for $1)to get the Mexican candy before you leave. They rock!"}
{"text":"Si Senor may I have more indeed.  

Came here for the first time a few weeks back and why have j been avoiding you do so long.  This place is delicious.  Nothing fancy, but if you know good Mexican food it should be simple ingredients down right and this place does just that. 

Great lunch menu if you swing in on your break.  And to top it off have a soppapilla with honey for dessert.  (Included with the lunch menu portions)."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Their margaritas are only a couple of bucks, so you can sip on a cocktail, eat chips and salsa, and visit with friends on a small budget. I really like the ground beef stuffed sopaipilla with hot green chili! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Si Senor has been a local favorite of ours and the owner, Irene Castillo has also been a long-time friend so it was only natural to book Si Senor for our catering needs for our wedding on July 3, 2015. 

The catering was a hit! During cocktail hour Si Senor had set up stations including rolled tacos, bean and cheese chimichangas and chips with salsa. They were delicious and very full-filling. Our guests couldn't believe these were only the appetizers! When dinner approached, they served an authentic Mexican meal with delicious and spicy hatch green chile verde, enchildadas, rice and beans. It was served buffet style, but three servers maintained the meat serving station. 

Irene Castillo was really invested in making sure our guests were happy and full and our guests adored her! Once dinner was over, we, The Brides, went to thank the servers and they graciously stated they were thrilled to serve during such a wonderful moment. That comment meant a lot to us. The buffet set-up was also beautiful and very clean. 

We would highly recommend anyone to dine-in at Si Senor and meet Irene for your catering or delivery needs!"}
{"text":"I have ordered many items off of the menu here and yet to be disappointed. The green sauce served with the chips is delicious if you like a kick! Enchiladas, chimis, taco salad is all tastee! It gets really busy at lunch, so be patient. During these busy times, we don't always get the same level of service. But Si Senor is still a go-to of ours when we have a taste for Mexican."}
{"text":"Bring that I'm from NM, I'll admit - I'm a little partial to Si Señor. However, that's only due to the fact that they nail the New Mexican food menu. Seeing as how they started out in Las Cruces, NM I'd expect nothing less than authentic New Mexican cuisine, and that's exactly what you get. 

The service is usually pretty good, I'd say the only downside is it's basically impossible to place a phone order. I've tried placing a call-in order about 5 times and was only successful once. They're always busy, which s a good thing, but I feel as though it has to deter some business when you literally have to drive there and place your to-go order in person, then wait for it to be prepared. 

All in all the food is excellent and worth waiting for, as our family comes here at least 2-3 times a month. Highly recommend their ground beef tacos, and enchilada-style (smothered) burritos. Kiddos usually enjoy a taco plate or bean and cheese burrito. Last, their sopapillas are a heavenly ending to your meal - pro tip: get the cinnamon and sugar ones all day everyday."}
{"text":"Thursday night, party of 10, family meeting out of town guests for dinner. Chips and salsa they give were pretty good although the server had to be asked to refill it. Half of the table had no silverware when the entrees arrived. They charge you for splitting an entree. The food was just ok. It was very disappointing that the tortillas were store bought and not homemade. I probably won't return. It definitely was not the authentic Mexican I was hoping to show my out of town guests."}
{"text":"We love Si Señor...It has the taste of home that my family craves! Their portions are great for the price, and to finish the meal with a fresh sopapilla... YUM!!! I especially appreciate the Zia symbol when you walk in, since I am from Las Cruces, and the big picture in the lobby of the Si Señor restraunt back home"}
{"text":"This is a NEW MEXICAN restaurant and you can expect to actually get HOT red/green chili that rivals the best restaurants NM has to offer (and it's reasonably priced).  

Having lived in NM for 20 years, I'm extremely spoiled and want my Mexican food with the spice that you can only get from the NM grown Anaheim Green Chili's and Si Senor's has that in spades.  

It's very casual so you can feel comfortable sitting down to a meal after a hard day's work and the staff is always courteous & quick.  As soon as you sit down, you are munching on chips with 4 incredible salsa/dip choices.  It's always a little busy, but after eating there dozens of times I can only remember the service being a bit slow once (found out they were short staffed that night, so it was understandable).

My favorites -  the chile relleno & the hatch valley chile con carne (\"Christmas Style\" of course, with both red & green chile & an egg on top).  YUM!! 

My only warning - try not to over eat!  Just get the left over box and have some more another day as the free sopapillas for dessert are too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"After living in NM for 10 years and moving to AZ 4 yrs ago I have been searching for authentic NM food. I had all but given up until I tried si señors . The relleno was perfection as well as the \"hot\" green chili and everything on my plate. And of course it would no be a NM dish without sopapillas..."}
{"text":"Lived in Albuquerque for nearly 10 years, I'm always missing and craving the hatch green chili! They are very authentic and love my #3. Glad they finally added the Chili cheese fries, yummy goodness. Chili con carne with HOT green chili AhhhhMazing! Staff are always friendly. Always go there with the hubby for our fix!"}
{"text":"The Best of Phoenix issue did not disappoint me or my daughter.  I got a delicious combination of spiciness.  The complimentary chips come with a variety of dips - salsa, bean dip, and some kind of creamy goodness.  The daughter was a little skeptical of all three options, so more for me.  I see other reviews referring to four dips, so maybe I was drunk off of over eating.  At the end, they give you a sapodilla to ensure that your belly is full and round.  The daughter was happy about that and I had to roll myself back to the car."}
{"text":"Ok so I guess I'm the odd one out here. The service was great the happy hour deal with imported beers for $2.50 was excellent but the food was just average. Well the chips were ok with the salsas, beans and sour cream but both of our meais were disappointing. It almost tasted like the food was premade and then heated up though I wouldn't accuse them of this it just sort of tasted that way. I had the veggie combo - the chile releno was mostly breading and kind of bland, the enchilada was decent but nothing that made it stand out and the taco was almost all lettuce with some beans but not much flavor.  They do charge for extra chips but to me for two people that's not a big deal since the portions are more than enough with one basket of chips. I will give it a second shot since everyone here says it's very good."}
{"text":"Recently moving from Las Cruces, NM where the only other Si Señor restaurant is (and absolutely loved going there (at least once a week)), I was extremely disappointed when I came to this location. I was really hoping I would be able to come here and enjoy some good New Mexican food that would remind me of home. First off, the overall ambience of the restaurant seemed dull and unauthentic. My girlfriend and I both ordered margaritas to start off. We were extremely unsatisfied with the size as well as the taste (it seemed as if they were made with cheap margarita mix had only a drop of tequila in them). The ones in Las Cruces were delicious and served in large, cold glass whereas these seemed to come in something equivalent to a sippy cup-sized plastic cup. Did I mention that it tasted like cheap margarita mix and no alcohol? They were rubbish. We also received the chips and salsa (which was mine and also my grandma's favorite part of coming to Si Señor), and my anticipation was totally shot down by the stale chips and tasteless assortment of salsas and dips. My grandma would be horrified if she had been there. She may be Filipino, but she knows what real Mexican food tastes like. Then there was the food. Bland, boring, room temperature and did not remind me of home. If Chef Ramsey was there, I can almost guarantee he would be extremely unsatisfied and then make a scene. We also received sopapillas at the end of our meal and those were as well bland and room temperature and also stale. In conclusion, I was very unsatisfied with my visit to this Si Señor location. If I'm not mistaken, a husband and wife own this chain, so my message to the manager of this restaurant, you've been away from New Mexico for too long and have no bloody idea what you're doing. Step it up and provide the citizens of Maricopa county with some delicious, warm and enjoyable New Mexican Cuisine. 
P.S. Your margaritas are pathetic and you need to step those up as well."}
{"text":"I'm have become so disappointed in Si Señor. Being from New Mexico, I sought this restaurant several years ago. The food was everything I had hoped for...true New Mexico cuisine. I learned that the original owners no longer operate the restaurant. Not sure where the new owners are from, but they've abandoned the wonderful New Mexican recipes for yet another boring, generic version of the same ol' same ol', that plagues the Phoenix area.
The green sauce has none of that \"Hatch\" flavor that people used to drive miles for. And the red Chile is so overburdened with flour, that is a bit like eating Chile flavored paste.
I am so sad that the quality has really tanked here.
Won't make the 30 mile drive again."}
{"text":"The ONLY place to get good Mexican food in Phoenix. Born and raised in southern New Mexico, near the original si senor! The food is always amazing at this place and the staff is friendly. Trust me, try this and you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"The food is is very spicy hot so if you like to feel the burn going in and later than this is a good place. The problems I have with it are the way you get nickle and dimed for extra chips, drink refills, etc. The place is clean and service is generally good."}
{"text":"We have been going here for the past few years.  My other half is a New Mexican native and we have always enjoyed going here since our first time.  It can be a bit tricky finding good New Mexican food here, there is really only one other place we know of so far.  On our last visit, we noticed how stingy they where with the chips and salsa, we always really enjoy that, but there was barely more than a tablespoon of each, barely enough to dip.  We both ordered the taco plate, one of our favorites.  The taco shell/tortillas have shrunk to a size between a normal taco size and a street taco size for the same price.  They were also cold, except for the usual super hot plate with beans and rice.  Kind of disappointing as it was a favorite place.  Also, it is easy to say that my other half is a bean expert, making the best beans I have ever had and been eating them since he was a baby.  He told me the beans were canned, and that they weren't before here.  Why have they gone so cheap all of a sudden?  Very sad, not sure if and when we will go back if there are better options."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is good (not excellent) and they give you plenty of it. The prices are reasonable. Everything I have tried has been spicy but not to the point of discomfort. Mexican is my favorite so I am somewhat of a critic however, the warm sopapillas with honey are worth the trip alone. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great service abd great food, pretty awesome you hey so many dips with your chips and a free dessert at the end:) will definitely come back. I had the green Chille carne asada burrito abd a red cheese enchilada so yummy. Couldn't finish but my left overs will be amazing"}
{"text":"I LOVE mexican food!!  I am always looking for another good spot to feed my addiction.  I am happy to say I found one that is always just a couple of miles from my house!!  I love the atmosphere here.  I went in for lunch and the place is bright and cheery.  I thought the tables and the chairs were so cute.  The chairs had sunflowers carved on them and painted a sunny yellow.  So cheery!!  

My server brought me a basket of chips and four.....yes four dips!!  The traditional red salsa, a sour cream and jalapeno dip, a bean dip with bits of chorizo in it, and a spicy green salsa that had tons of flavor!!  I love tortilla chips and these were fresh and hot!  The perfect chip in my opinion.  My server told me that they have a tortilla factory in New Mexico and they get the tortillas fresh a couple of times a week to make their own chips.  YUM!!!  They have a lunch special every day and my day was Sopapillas.  They give you a choice of red or green sauce, I chose red cause, yes, I am a wimp.  I can't take a lot of heat.  It was yummy and saucy.  The plate came with two delicious sopapillas filled with ground beef and generous portions of rice and beans.  My only complaint was the filling.....it needed something, maybe some green chiles or some other thing to spice it up just a bit.  They were good, just a bit bland.  The rice and beans were great!  The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were topped with lots of cheese.  And the other amazing part was that they give you a sopapilla for dessert too!!  I got a cinnamon sugar one and it was heavenly.  I thought I would only eat a bite cause I was so full but I ended up eating the whole thing!!  

I will defintly be going back to Si Senor!!  The food was great, service was fast and friendly and I have a feeling I will be craving those chips and dips again soon!!!"}
{"text":"So delicious and on the less expensive side. Just try and save room for desert....I always forget it comes with the meal."}
{"text":"Good food.  The sopapillas are an excellent addiction, especially the cinnamon sugar ones, and are the reason for the four stars.  The mildest of the three levels of chili is mild enough even for pasty white boring me, yet still delicious and flavorful.  The hotest chilis satisfieds my coworkers with even the most burned-out of tastebuds.  Portions are plentiful and dinner under $10 is quite doable."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.  7.50$ lunch special for a burrito, rice and beans.  Came with a free dessert.
Food was pretty decent, and plentiful for the price.
Their salsa is a little bland."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been going since my family told me about it!!  This is some good New Mexico Mexican food!  Service is always fast and wonderful - their much special is available even on the weekends and the perfect portion!"}
{"text":"Best New Mexican Green Chile based meal in town. If I had this place in my town I'd be here twice a month.   Grab your favorite person and take them here now. 

Great food. Try the Flautas and Chile Rellenos.

Casual ambiance that has an open and comfortable feel.

Good service that makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"My most favorite New Mexican place. I love the chips and dips and the large dinner portions. The taco are awesome. I also love the free desert. Great."}
{"text":"Fire new mexican food! All the sauces were seasoned perfectly and super flavorful. The Chile relleno was money. Slightly crispy on the outside. The sour creme has green chillies in it and it's ridiculous. Good size potuons, the rice was tasty and the beans were seasoned just right  the sopapilla was fluffy and airy. Service was good. Left happy. This is a gem."}
{"text":"So, this mexican restaurant is just like any other mexican restaurant in the valley. If you like the same ol', same ol' kind of Mexican food then you'll like this place. On the other hand I like the more modern style mexican restaurants myself. One thing that really got me and irritated the heck out of me about this place is serving the food out of a plastic tray. I feel like I'm back in Junior High School. I want real plates, round plates, I prefer squared plates but it doesn't really matter as long as they are actual plates. In conclusion, I will probably never go to this restaurant ever again. If I wanted to be served food in this manner, I would go to \"Filiberto's\" and get me a \"number1\" combo plate and then proceed to pour it into my dog dish and then eat it (save some money this way)."}
{"text":"Being a native New Mexican who has searched high and low throughout the Phoenix Valley for traditional New Mexican food, this was a very big blessing. Not only authentic chile, but a familiar face and taste I've enjoyed from Las Cruces and Farmington, NM. REAL Hatch green chile. Real, actual sopapillas AND a photo of the original restaurant from the home of my college, NMSU in Las Cruces... I'll be back for sure. Thank you for existing, now never close!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the red chile pork. Tender and melt in your mouth good. The rice and beans also tasted freshly made  and were tasty. Service was great, restaurant was clean and is modern."}
{"text":"I love the New Mexican food, as it is sometimes hard to find out here in Phoenix since moving from New Mexico. This place does not disappoint and keeps me coming back. 

The complimentary chips and dip variety is great, followed by a huge portioned meal, and free soppapias! What more can you ask for? They offer three levels of spiciness with most entrees. My favorite is the hot green hatch, they are spicy and very flavorful! Try the house made raspberry tea."}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico, I need a taste of home every once in a while, and this place satisfies that craving. I used to go to the Original Si Señor in Las Cruces for lunch and happy hour, and I'm happy to see the same great food happy hour here in Chandler. Best chips and salsa and sopapillas in town!"}
{"text":"Love it! Being from New Mexico, this food was like home away from home!  They had the choice of mild or spicy, but I of course went with hot! Leaving with tingling lips! Perfect!"}
{"text":"Decided the give this place another chances and is so disappointed that I did. There service is horrendous. Waited forever the get out order taken. When we asked about the menue the waitress has absolutely no knowledge about the food. When she dropped the food off she forgot to give us silverware.  Iv know been sitting here for over 20min haven't even touched my plate becasue I really don't feel like eating with my hands. When she finally did come back she was rude and sarcastic. So know I just wasted over $20 bucks for a lousy mushy lasty looking sopapillas or what ever it is. The meet looks lie dog food. The only good this here is there margaritas and there dip. I am Beyond disappointed. Don't come here. I know I won't"}
{"text":"This is a little taste of heaven. Good New Mexico Mexican cuisine is hard to find in AZ, but Si Senor has got you covered. The green chile is real Hatch chile and it's delicious. The red chile is my favorite but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I have loved this restaurant for years but the last two times have been beyond disappointing. It took almost ten minutes to get drink/chips. The waitress only had appeared to have 4 tables to tend to but really slow. She left our table w our food on cart to give another table their drinks. The tacos were soggy on one side. We were so irritated that we skipped the sopapiilas but then had to wait to get the check.. I think that's the last time we are going there."}
{"text":"So me and my buddy hit this spot up on a Saturday night. It has a nice feel to it, good music playing, nice lighting, tv's with sports on. The staff is friendly enough, and the food came quickly and was deliciously hot and melty. They start you off with chips and salsa which is actually 4 separate dipping sauces including beans. My only complaint is I ordered the chimichanga plate enchilada style and was expecting a larger meal. Tasted good but a little small. I think I just ordered the wrong thing. My buddy got the green chili platter and was huge and looked awesome.  Then they top it off with fresh hot sopappias (get them covered in cinnamon. ...trust me lol). Plan on going back for a combo plate or the green chili burro looked great.  Happy hogging lol"}
{"text":"Had to write a review for Si Sensor Restaurant because I absolutely LOVED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE I received from the Catering Manager Yolanda! I was in search of a Mexican restaurant that caters tacos for a casual work dinner we hosted at my boss's house in the Gilbert area. After researching several competitors I chose Si Senor based on their amazing reviews on Yelp, selection of their CATERING menu, great prices, and location. I happen to reach out to Yolanda during her day off and while she was away from the office and she had no issues taking down my order. She gave me a call later that day after she returned to the restaurant to give me an exact price. Definitely appreciated her taking time from her off day to go back to work and take care of my order.Yolanda even called the day before to confirm my order.

Our order consisted of 2 chicken taco trays, 2 beef taco trays (12 tacos in each tray), 1.5 dozen of sopapillas, 1 tray of beans, 1 tray of salsa, 1 tray of tortilla chips, and 12 oz salsa red, green, and white salsa. Our order was more than enough to feed our party of 16 adults. The tacos were crunchy, but not too greasy. Meat, rice and beans were tasty. Sopapillas were as good as everyone raves about. My favorite was the WHITE SALSA. It was the right amount of spiciness that I LOVE!  I received no complaints about the food. Everyone absolutely loved everything!

Upon arrival, our order was ready, packaged, and loaded on a cart ready to transfer into our car. Yolanda was at the front desk and greeted us. She was so friendly and welcoming. THANK YOU AGAIN YOLANDA! It was a pleasure doing business with you and your staff!"}
{"text":"After coming here for more than 10 years and often times weekly I must say that I am disappointed with the lack of consistency of their chips/salsa. The chips are grease laden and hard to eat. However we notice that other tables have different types of chips. Why the difference? Confused to say the least. We are pleased with the waitress and entrees. Not sure about consistently returning....."}
{"text":"Still searching for that inexpensive Mexican restaurant with decent flavor.  So I decided to stop in and try their Chili Meat Burrito with pork and red sauce for lunch.  First off they bring pretty good chips and 4 different sauces, not a bad start.  The burrito was of normal size with a portion of refried beans and rice.  Overall the meal was OK, enough so that I will venture back and try a different dish.  Not a bad lunch for $8.13...worth giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"I love everything here, but what makes Si Senor really stand out?

* Fantastic hot green chile.
* Chips with 4 great tasting dips.
* Sopapillas coated with cinnamon & sugar.

It can get very crowded at lunch.  The place opens at 10:30am.  Choose your arrival time wisely."}
{"text":"Omg!  This was truly a find. I came upon this place by accident and feel blessed to have found it. As a traveling salesperson I have to grab and go. While waiting for my appointment I sat down to eat here. The Chile Relleno with green sauce was to die for. I would have licked the plate if it was proper. The price was so reasonable and it came with rice and refried beans. The complimentary tortilla chips came with 4 different sauces. I am now stuffed. To top it off, I feel like I was awarded a sopadilla for desert. Next time I am in Arizona, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico I thought id go here and have some amazing Green and Red Chile dishes. Not so much. I spent 14yrs in New Mexico and know New Mexican food very well. This is a fairly bad knockoff of what New Mexican food is. 

Si Senor is a bland chain in New Mexico that is reaching to capture other markets apparently. This is no Los Cuates!"}
{"text":"We had about a group of 20 celebrating early Cinco de Mayo. This is a great place for large groups. They have a few separate dining areas.  

I had the chicken chimichanga with green chile sauce plate. The potion size was decent.  I thought the green chile sauce just wasn't enough on the chimichange. 
No sour cream and guac came with the plate. I don't mind paying for them if the server offered. It wouldn't be a Cinco de Mayo celebration without margaritas. The ladies ordered strawberry and classic frozen margaritas while the boys got beers. If you are a light weight with the alcohol consider sharing the margarita.    

At least they still give complimentary chips & salsa plus sopapilla for dessert.  They bring you both sopapilla in plain and cinnamon sugar.  Made hot and fresh!  It's messy, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"If you like frog meat then you'll want to eat here because the food looks and tastes disgusting the food is served on a platter like a dog bowls so gross I would never eat here"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Free chips and salsa partnered with very good Mexican food. Always a 10."}
{"text":"I go here for their chips and dips. Their green chili dip is out of this world amazing. I would order it by the gallon if I could. The taco salad is good, and comes with sour cream and guac, without being an additional charge. The enchiladas and flauta plates meet expectations. They serve a number of new mexican style hatch green chili plates. A favorite of mine. Avoid on Friday and Saturday nights, the line and wait is just ridiculous. It's not the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to, but few restaurants in the area have a variety of green chili dishes, let alone good ones. So for this, I give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Las Cruces bringing the best Mexican food to the valley.  I lived in Las Cruces and I'm telling you they have THE best Mexican restaurants ever.  Si Señor in Cruces is not even one of the best ones, but it's way better than anything I've had living 10 years in Albuquerque.

From the signage in the front, to the moment I walked in the door, it looked like the one at \"home\".  Just like I remember it.  Love the picture right in the front with the Organ mountains in the background.  Ok, ok, enough reminiscing, onto the food.  I loved the salsas.  Haven't had the green chile salsa in a while, but it was yummy.  The red was hot, a good hot.  I ordered a combo and everything was just delicious.  I honestly judge a true Mexican restaurant by their rice.  It's been a while since I've had some decent rice and this one was very tasty.  I wish there had been more on the plate. And lastly, the sugary sopas were the icing on the cake.  Finger licking good!

So glad this place is here, a bit of a drive, but totally worth it to me to make me feel like I have something just like home."}
{"text":"I  loved this place!  Their green chili is super spicy. Love it! $1 magaritas rock. The atmosphere is perfect.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I will go back many times."}
{"text":"So my second visit was not as pleasurable as the first. The food lacks the flavor that I am looking for. New Mexican food at its finest. Not as spicy as some other places but more flavor. The green chili has a nice zip to it but is also packed with tons of texture and flavor. The pork is seasoned well and super tender. Beans and rice were good, too. A cinnamon sugar sopapilla to top it off is a nice touch. Chips come with cream, beans, and green and red salsa. Interior transports you to New Mexico and staff is great."}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix, I usually prowled around North Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale; avoiding venturing anywhere south of Broadway, west of 7th Avenue and east of Alma School. Yes, I admit it...I was a North Phoenix Snob......but I have reformed my ways and on a recent trip back to the desert, a group of friends suggested Si Senor for a great \"New Mexico style\" Mexican meal.  All I can say is Booyah!!! Si Senor (despite the cheesy name) delivered respectably as promised. 

I had the sopapilla stuffed with beef and covered with a not too spicy red chile sauce, and my friends all got the sampler platter, or as they referred to it, the \"pig platter\". Their description would prove to be accurate and it was a sight to behold...three strapping men who could NOT finish everything on  their plates. For desert we had cinnamon and sugar dusted sopapillas (okay, I had them since everyone else was wallowing around in their chairs miserably) to which I added copious amounts of honey, of course.

I would have given five stars here, but according to my local piglets, Si Senor has raised their prices recently, and now charges for refills of chips and salsa. In my book, bottomless chips/salsa are a requirement  for any Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Si Senors is the best in the West when looking for New Mexican food!!  They have quick service, good chips and salsa, great dishes and free sopapillas for after your meal.  They can be a little stingy on chips as it is noted that they charge for another serving....so ask ahead."}
{"text":"No Señor !!!!!

Forget the dusty fake plants, out of date decor, and unappetizing atmosphere - some of that could be considered old school if the food was legit.  

Unfortunately the food is far worse than the decor.  The food is delivered to your table on a dirty bus cart . . . Mmmmmm

The pork plate literally looks like Alpo.   Low quality meat slathered in disgusting gravy.  I picture a kitchen worker with a cigarette dangling from their mouth slopping the portions on to the plates.  The presentation is as disgusting as the food as the decor . . . 

The fajita salad might be the saddest, most remedial, uncaring dish I have ever seen.  When my girlfriend let the server know the chicken was tough and chewy (as if it had been re used) she replied, \"it's gross isn't it?\"    I almost fell out of my chair .

The  greasy tacos in front of me instantly became even more unappetizing . . . That comment aside, the tacos were disgusting enough are their own. 

I sat there looking at the disgusting food and surroundings and really questioned how they stay in business (and even more so why I was still sitting there)

Their ingredients are the lowest grade I've ever seen in a restaurant , and the presentation is enough to make you lose your appetite.  It is truly a disgusting experience.   

No Señor !!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place hands down to eat red chili! The green is good but extremely spicy."}
{"text":"Woooo Hoooooo HOT!  If you are a fan of New Mexico style heat this is the place for you.  Be careful when you dive into the dipping sauces they offer with the chips, looks can be deceiving.  My missing star is due to the fact that I think it would be nice for the servers to give you a heads up on the heat, especially when there are kids at the table.

I have the fajitas when we go and my honey has the chicken enchiladas.  We've yet to be disappointed.  At the end of your meal they bring you warm sopappillas! (sp) that are a perfect finish.  I'd recommend trying Si Senor's if your in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Authentic New Mexican food right down to the Question! .... Red or Green,? ( chile... I am definitely a green fan and si senor does not disappoint) The homemade chips ( thin and warm when served with not 1 or 2 but 4 salsas green white brown, bean & red! The white is unique and tasty. Fully echo other  yelper' s comments about excellent service. My new favorite in Phoenix. Nice East valley location too! Better than los dos Molinos! Although not as hot"}
{"text":"To me New Mexican cuisine means heat and this place does it right. Be prepared when they bring you your complimentary chips and salsa because it will set the mode for the rest of your meal. If you thinks its hot, then go easy on the rest. I don't want to turn you away, it's not going to burn your tongue off. Put it to you this way, the chips and salsa comes with three different flavors of salsa. If they put that much effort into just the complimentary salsa, they put enough care into the rest of your food too."}
{"text":"Been patronizing this restaurant since we moved to Chandler in 2002.  One of the finest southwest cuisine restaurants in the country in my opinion.  Great menu, good service and absolutely consistent throughout the last 12 years."}
{"text":"Si Señor is definitely my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant... By far. I'm from New Mexico and ever since moving to Arizona, I hadn't found any great Mexican food... Until this place. I was raised on Mexican food and I can tell you that Si Señor is completely authentic New Mexican cuisine. I love getting the combination plate (#1). That way you get a bit of everything. And don't even get me started on the happy hour margaritas... But the chips and 4 different salsas are the best part!! I'll see you soon Si Señor!"}
{"text":"Very good,authentic Mexican food. Happy hour margaritas are only 2.50, they give you a variety of homemade chili sauces to go with your chips and to finish your meal you get complementary soppias. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"You know you are in the right place when It is bustling with people on just a random Monday evening. 

The menu has an ample assortment of dinners and combination platters, it made it really hard to finally pick a plate. Everyone in my party was raving about their dinners, all the food was top notch. Plus I really enjoyed the different choices of sauces to use on the enchiladas and different items. The margaritas were also dangerously good.

 I may have found a new favorite Mexican food place in Arizona."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Si senor is one of my \"go to\" Mexican food restauarants. I love the chips and they serve them with green sauce, red salsa, a sour cream spicy dip,and beans. They are all great and the green definitely has a hot kick. 

I like their food. I had stuffed sopapillas with shredded beef. I would like to have had more flavor in the beef but Ming it with the green sauce helps. I do love their rice and I don't often find a place that has good Mexican rice. Friends had the flauta plate, a tamale, tacos and enchiladas. Everybody was quite pleased with their lunch. 

Sopapillas for dessert are great. I grew up in New Mexico where most Mexican food restaurants serve them for Dessert. They were light and flaky."}
{"text":"Fantastic New Mexican cuisine, the best that I have had.  We've always been seated pretty much right away and the restaurant is nice and large and can accommodate big parties.  The ambiance is nothing special but is clean and comfortable.  The food is where its at though.

As soon as you sit down they bring out free chips and four different salsas.  The green spicy salsa and the creamy white salsa are hands down my favorite but the red and the bean dip are both good too.  They will charge for extra chips and salsa which is a bit of a bummer and their chips could be fresher and thinner in my opinion.

Make sure you try the hatch chile while you are here.  Their pork chile verde is very good, their flour tortillas are great and the burritos are not to be missed.  Their portions are huge and easily shareable but the prices are also very reasonable.  To top it off you finish the meal with plain or cinnamon sopapillas which are a real treat.  Margaritas are a little weak so make special requests if you don't like watered down drinks.  Otherwise a great place!"}
{"text":"Si Senor is my favorite Mexican food restaurant. I love that you get four different dips with the chips and all four are wonderful. You can't get anything like the sour cream salsa at any other restaurant. I have liked every meal that I have tried. The rice is cooked  well and has the perfect spices. In addition to the amazing meal, you get a sopapilla at the end. The service has always been kind and attentive. My husband and I go at least once a month."}
{"text":"Holy giant portions!  My boyfriend and I split a plate and were still stuffed.  I ordered the combo plate #1 which came with Rolled cheese enchilada, tamale, relleno, taco, 
Hatch Valley chile con carne smothered with your choice of chile.  I am a wimp so I did not choose the hot chile.  Really good, except the taco...this was totally a ground beef taco...yucky...but the rest of the food on the plate made up for that taco.  They do charge 2.95 for sharing but it is worth it because I don't see how anyone could finish a plate on their own.  They have such an assortment of flavors with their chips and salsa.  It comes with bean dip, green salsa, red salsa and a ranch type of dip.  All were quite tasty.  The best part is that the meal comes with sopapillas!  YUMMY.  They were delish.  They just need to get rid of that ground beef taco and replace that with some good ol shredded beef, that was the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered a beer & they salted the glass without asking. Ordered carne asada tacos... Each one had less than an ounce of meat & the tortilla was hard (not fried). Salsa was decent. Service was acceptable. I'll look elsewhere for tacos."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday.....the reviews we right on, things were spicy, just the way I like it. It was funny as I looked around the dining room folks were sniffing from runny noses, awesome! Its the first time I ever had hot (temperature wise) dipping sauces for my chips...I'm not complaining just different. I like them all but after munching on them for about 15 minutes the red was in the lead followed closely by green hatch(hottest). Keep in mind this appetizer of chips and dips has the power to fill you up. My main entree with the Deluxe combination platter...it was too much food especially after over doing it on the chips/dips. The star for me was the red chili con carne. Solid rice and re-fried beans.
I didn't care for the tamale as much and the cheese enchilada was just taking up space.
Now that I know what its all about I can be more selective when I go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here once, that was enough. Very Americanized, bland, \"Mexican\" food. Very heavy on the cheese. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great food! I always order cheese enchiladas with the spicy green sauce.  You can't go wrong with them.  Beware of the salsa quartet...it's addicting! I honestly can't pick a favorite. I'm tempted to order extra cinnamon sugar sopapillas at the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"Si Seor is the best Mexican food Chandler has to offer, from what I've tried.  The vegetarian combination is the best!  They offer quite a few combination platters to choose from, or you can get a plate of just your favorites.  I bring all of my out-of-town visitors to this restaurant, pushing the sangria and combinations to all who dine with me.  Their horchata is also quite tasty, and it's a nice compliment to the dishes with the red sauce.  The sopapilla is a perfect ending, and I'm happy to report that they also include them with take-out orders.  Very good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Ambience is good 4 of 5, appetizer chips and salsa was good can be better, comes with four dipping bean, salsa, ranch & chilli salsa 3 of 5. Main course was good can be better, we ordered fajitas, and burritos the veggies were over cooked also the qty was less, tortilla were dry and not fresh guacamole was not so fresh and okay in taste. Service was poor as they took 10min to get me beans after serving fajitas also they served my pepsi 5 min before ending my dinner that too  after two reminders. Avg price per person was 15$ not value for money considering the qty and service. I am not sure how it got best review on Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice restaurant to dine solo or bring the family. It is typical Sonoran fare with New Mexico dishes and hatch chiles also on the menu. 
Terrific bean dip with your chips, along with 3 other dips.

If you've eaten red chile, chile con colorado, chile con carne, etc. at other places in the valley, try the Red chile con carne here. Excellent flavor and made with pork, not beef.

As to the question does Si Senor merit being a \"regular stop\" on the list? Having been to most Mexican restaurants in the valley at least once, Si Senor is easily better than the second rate fare dished out at east valley Garcia's, Serrano's, etc. and it's a nice atmosphere. Give it a go, no disappointments here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended from an Offer Up seller as we are not familiar with the area.   Fantastic service.  Each bite was delicious and I was completely satisfied and happy about our dinner!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way from Glendale just to eat here! And to be honest, their red Chile enchiladas are so good I'd travel all the way to Las Cruces, NM to eat at the original restaurant (if this one didn't exist). Everything from the free assortment of salsa to the free sopapillas for dessert is amazing!!!! Only two complaints, if you go on a weekend expect to wait around 30 minutes to be seated, and it is extremely humid and hot in the restaurant. I happened to be seated by the thermostat and it said it was 85 degrees in there the whole time. If the food wasn't so good this would be unacceptable!"}
{"text":"We are from Las Cruces and we are so happy to have Si Senor New Mexico Cuisine in Chandler. This is our favorite place."}
{"text":"We tried Si Senor in our recent visit to Arizona, and overall, we liked it.  First, they brought out chips (1st basket is free) for appetizers with four things to dip them into, two chile sauces, beans, and a sour cream based one.  They were all yummy!  I ordered the Si Senor Combo plate which came with an enchilada, a chile relleno, a taco, and a tamale, all smothered under their green chile sauce.  I subbed the tamale for taco, and they were very accommodating.  The dish, overall, was good.  I would've liked the taco to be carne asada instead of ground beef, but it was still okay.  And for desert, our meal included sopapillas which was tasty.  Will probably try Si Senor again when we are back in AZ.

Overall, good food, okay service, okay prices."}
{"text":"A significant change from my previous 5 star review, and that is about the chips and salsa that I like so much.  Used to be served with 4 different kinds of dips 1. red salsa 2.  green chilli salsa 3.  sour cream, milk and jalapenos concoction 4.  warm refried beans in a scalloped clear plastic ice cream cup.  

Well today April 23, 2018, I went, and the restaurant changed the more generous and deeper plastic ice cream cup to put the chip dips in, to something like a shallow round ash tray, with only 2 tablespoons of salsa, and two tablespoons of the rest of the listed items.  The \"ashtray\" is filled only half full, which is two tablespoons.  Barely enough to cover the bottom, which means it isn't deep enough for dipping, except the mere corners and edges of your chip.  The chip is bigger than the little \"ash tray\".  Your two tablespoons of salsa in the crock are gone with 2 chips, if you ask for a spoon to help spoon the salsa onto your chip, like I did.  So your dips get eaten real fast.  I asked for more, but after asking several times for more, cos remember I said each crock only takes care of two chips.  

Annoying to have to look for our server again and again to bring us more salsa, after eating only two chips.  My friend said to me,  \"They are so stingy with the salsa\".  I wanted to put more salsa on my chili relleno and asked for more, but then my friend ate what server brought for my chili relleno, so when I asked for another one, my server said she was gonna have to charge me.  She said many people don't even eat the salsa, so it all goes to waste.  That is why they went to serving so little, now, and we could always ask for more.   I said \"Well I'm Not PAYING EXTRA, you only give 2 tablespoons\". 

  I agree with the waste, but two tablespoons so shallow you cannot even \"dip\", is on the other extreme.  My eating buddy was already writing her Google review while we were eating, and mentioning in her review that she was eating with a Yelp Eliter.  When she told the server that we were writing reviews, the server was really much nicer, and brought me another crock of salsa that she filled to the brim, instead of another 2 tablespoons.  When I saw the difference in the amount in the crock this time (to the brim), she remarked acknowledgement that she hand ladled the salsa and deliberately filled it to the brim (meaning 4 tablespoons instead of 2).  

I did not waste anything short of licking the little \"ashtrays\" before I left.   I even asked to take home the two tablespoons of salsa that was left in that ashtray , cos I had to hurry off to my dental appt.  Valerie our server looked at me with dismay and almost shock, when I said I wanted to take home the little bit of salsa and leftover chips, but said she nothing, and got me the container and takeout paper bag for the chips.  I guess most people who leave it there to be thrown away, but hey, I just really enjoyed it at 8 pm tonight, at home.  

I think the lunch special for $7.95 is good value, includes drink, entree, the chips and dips, and sopapilla.  When I paid at the cash register, I mentioned to the cash register lady, that there is only 2 tablespoons of salsa in that ashtray, can't even dip but little edge or corner of your chip.  She said, \"I told her not to charge you for the salsa.\"

 Yes, well, thank you.  See you again when I have another dental appt (dental office is at Country Club N. of Elliot)."}
{"text":"The service was great and fast! The chips brought out were of great quality, none of that store bought tortilla chips I see all the time! Four dips including salsa were also free. 
I ordered the chicken fajita plate thinking it was a little pricey, but nope! I got so much food with it I asked for a box right when the waitress set the food down. Chicken was good, veggies were awesome and the tortillas served were warm. Only thing I wish was that I got a little more variety of veggies, I only saw bell peppers and onion. 
I didn't get the sopapilla dish but the table next to ours did and DAMN did it look good!! Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I brought some friends from NM and they totally loved it. Corina was our server and she was awesome! This is a Friday night at 7 pm and she was super busy yet treated us like we were her only table. The chips and salsa also came with green chile, beans and sour cream sauce. So delicious. I had stuffed sopapillas with medium red chile. They were so good, with ground beef, red chile and rice and beans. I think they could've used some fresh lettuce but were fantastic nonetheless. Mom had the same with spicy green chile and absolutely ate her entire plate. My friend had a combo plate with a flauta, taco and enchilada. She loved all of it smothered in green chile. Nothing special about the margs but we really loved the food."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food in the valley. I literally live in Peoria and make the drive here just for the food. I crave it in a daily basis. Not to mention the green chili is out of this world! You can get mild or hot and of course being from New Mexico I get the hot. It does not disappoint. 
The service is always amazing and the food is always great. I love the chips and salsa they bring before the food with four choices of dips for the chips. I always seem to overeat when I come here because it is addicting! I literally eat till I am sick! It is worth the drive and if you haven't eaten here you have to do it ASAP!"}
{"text":"So good! Amazing hot and mild green chili! Chips are awesome and meal comes with four different salsas and free sopapillas! Tip: order burritos ala carte plenty of food and save you half the price of the full meal!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Si Señor we live Queen Creek it's worth the drive The pork red chili is the best in town and margaritas wow"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the world.  We live in CO and make it a point to stop at Si Señor every time we visit AZ."}
{"text":"Do not order anything chicken or carne. The worst meat I've ever had. Waitress was great the food was pretty bland but chips were good."}
{"text":"Just reading some of the other reviews and l am laughing my butt off.
People complaining about the sangria, or comparing to old Town San Diego!!
Listen up snowflakes....
This is real food, made by real people.
My wife and I are older, Sun lakes types, and are always greeted and treated very hospitably by everyone here!! Food is fresh, hot and delicious. Not phony Mexican\" gourmet\" style. Down home style.
Maybe best food value in Phoenix area.
Example:
Start with complimentary chips and 4 dips!!!!
I usually get the #1 combo which has a beef taco, tamale, chili relleno ( the Best), enchilada, green chili with pork , beans  and rice!!!
I take one half home for tomorrows  breakfast.
Then they bring you a hot sopapilla for dessert.
Like I said, great service, tasty food, good value.
Just don't be a miserable snowflake and you'll probably enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"My coworker suggested this place and I'll say the food is decent, but the extras are what keeps me coming back. As soon as you sit down they give you hot chips with 4 different dipping sauces, which are all spicy and delicious! A bean dip, salsa, green chili salsa, and this jalapeño sour cream dip that is crazy addicting. We usually eat two baskets of chips! We got the chimichanga plate and the delux plate for dinner. The chimichanga is definitely smaller than a lot of other places that serves them and they don't give you a side of or put any lettuce or tomato or sour cream for the chimi. Everything you order they give you the option to smother with red sauce, green sauce, or a spicier green sauce. For the price I think the portions are a bit small. After dinner, they give you sopapillas which are warm and cinnamon sugary and so delicious when you drizzle honey over it! The service there has always been great and the restaurant is always packed. Overall it's pretty good for Mexican food and the extras just make it better!"}

I dont know what's up with all those 5 star reviews? These people must have never been to Old Town, San Diego.
The chili relliano was heavily dredged in four and was uneatable.
The sangria was way too sweet, I did not even drink it. I am sure Thunderbird tastes better than that! It was not homemade and came out of a cheap bottle and for $7.50/glass?! Wow! What a joke and a rip off!
When I saw the cart, I thought they were clearing the plates off the tables.
The rice came out of a bag and the beans came out of a can.
I am glad I did not order any meat, I bet that would really have been Alpo!
Salsas were not authentic Mexican.
Service was good.
There were all these plaques on the wall saying voted best Mexican food in Chandler.
If that's the best Chandler has to offer, then I am not returning to that town!"}

A basket of chips was brought to the table that had four dips.  One was sour cream mixed with jalapenos and green chile (yum), one was refried beans made with bacon and sausage (I believe - don't quote me on it because I don't eat pork), one was a red salsa and one was a green salsa.  I loved the red salsa!  Yum!

The food was really quite delicious, though definitely not low-calorie, and came in huge portions.

I particularly liked the red sauce that came on my shredded beef burrito.  I typically prefer the green chile sauce, but the green chiles here were not very spicy (even though I was asked if I wanted hot or mild).  

I even liked the sopapillas, which I had served with cinnamon, sugar and honey.  They were very light - almost like zeppoles, but a little more crisp.  

I will definitely come here again, hopefully for happy hour!"}
