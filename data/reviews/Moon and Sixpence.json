{"text":"The Moon and Sixpence is a charming little restaurant located right on Whitby's seafront. We didn't book ahead and they were completely full when we turned up, but the staff were really friendly and told us to return in two hours - we nearly went to find somewhere else as we were already hungry, but it looked so nice we decided to wait, and were really glad we did.  The inside of the restaurant is lovely, very romantic with candles on every table and even a grand piano!the food was even better - there was a lot of fresh seafood on the menu but I went for chicken in bacon with mozzeralla, which was gorgeous and my boyfriend had duck a l'orange,which he really enjoyed and said was a good introduction to duck as he'd never eaten it before. The service was very slow, but it probably seemed longer than it really was because we were so hungry! I'd definitely recommend this if you go to Whitby - great for couples or for groups!"}
{"text":"The Moon and Sixpence is a great place to chill out during the day or to go for a sophisticated evening drink. It is lovely to sit outside in the summer (though as its on a main thoroughfare for tourists is can get a bit crowded) and during the evening the bar area has a lively buzz. The staff are friendly and make wonderful cocktails. I've been for a drink quite a few times as this is one of the few bars in Whitby (as opposed to pubs) but I've only eaten there a couple of times. The food was nice, lots of local fish. The restaurant was much calmer than the bar area even though it was full. This is probably the nicest place in Whitby to go for a drink and it is definitely high up on the meal side too."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us, so we decided to give it a try. We were very pleasantly surprised! The restaurant that was in this location previously was dire, so it was fab to have a new place to have a nice meal when visited Whitby!    The restaurant has 2 levels and we were seated on the lower level with a view of the harborside. It was also a story night so seeing lightning flashing over the Abbey was an unexpected bonus!    The menu changes daily, and a lot of the ingredients are locally sourced and all is very fresh and beautifully cooked. Some have unexpected combinations, but work well and the plates arrive looking so pretty, you will want to take photos! We have had dinner here a few times and have not had one bad thing.    The bar has a large range of tipples and a few unique cocktail concoctions.    They are open for lunch and dinner, and food is reasonably priced. Lunch options range between £5 and £10 whilst dinner options range between £10 and £20. Frankley, the quality and tastiness are well worth the price paid for a meal here.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow. OK, so I am jumping on the Five Star bandwagon here. What a sweet gem of a seaside restaurant that my friends and I had lunch in during the Whitby Gothic Weekend.  First of all the name! Moon and Sixpence, so incredibly charming and magical- swoooon. I want to change my name to 'Moon-and-Sixpence', I love it so much. The food and service was just as good as the name. I ordered an espresso martini to start because you know I do love a martini! This cocktail really should have been ordered at the end because it was sweet and creamy with a little espresso bean on the top. For the entrée we all ordered the clam chowder because when you are seaside the natural rule is to order something seafood like. When the bowls of clam chowder arrived I knew we all made the perfect decision. The clams were in shell and it was a good sized serving. I do recommend the clam chowder even on it's own and not being a starter because it is truly filling. The clams were fresh and the chowder was hearty and delicious. My friends and I also ordered some chips, fries to the American Audience. We ordered regular salted chips and the crab chips for sharing. The salted chips were good on their own but all of us could not help but indulge in the crab chips. See my photo of the crab chips with the heaping mound of fresh crab placed on top of chips. Truly magnificent!  The service was just as fantastic, everyone was kind and seemed to enjoy the Whitby Gothic crowd. The interior is charming and something you would expect in a little British seaside town.   Moon and Sixpence you got my love!"}
{"text":"Nice casual setting with wonderfully prepared food.  Started off with salmon, haddock and coriander fish cakes which were fresh tasting, and perfectly seasoned. Risotto and smoked haddock was delicious as was the beer battered cod and chips.  Great wine selection with a large (225ml) glass available.  No room for desserts though.  Excellent prompt and charming service as well."}
{"text":"What a great little find. Located right in the harbour we were lucky that the evening was warm and we moseyed up at the right time to catch a table - as later many had their drinks stood on the pavement it got so busy! We treated ourselves (we were on our hols so why not) to some oysters with our drinks. Everything was beautifully presented, but not in an in your face I'm so fancy way, just classy and laid back. The waiter was super friendly and chilled out. I'd be back to Whitby, and the moon and sixpence, in a heartbeat."}
