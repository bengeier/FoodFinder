{"text":"Maybe I just had bad luck, but.....

I saw the good reviews and some pictures that made it look like Aladdin's pizza was similar to Colonnade's pizza - crispy cheese on top, lots of toppings in the middle - and was more than a little excited to get that kind of pizza without having to, y'know....go down to Centretown and lug a pizza back on the 14. (People get weird about pizza on the bus.)

So I call and order a large pepperoni and olive (olives are good dwi haters), and the man on the phone says \"30 minutes, maybe less.\" About 45-50 minutes later, he shows up, and.....this $20 pizza has become a $25 pizza. And another dollar on top of that to pay with debit. And tip.

When I get it inside, I find out it's.....well, it's not what I was hoping for. Blobby, oily cheese with a gross aftertaste, sparse toppings, and a crust that was way too doughy everywhere but the ends (which were burnt. i mean, i asked for well done, but jeez.) And that's okay if it's Pizza Shark prices, but for almost $30....

I think I'm going to stick with Colonnade's. :/"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review this place! This is THE place to go for pizza in Ottawa. As far as pizza goes in Ottawa this is as good as it gets. 

I used to enjoy the Aladdin's special before I was vegetarian, I can't remember exactly whats on it but I know it has bacon, green pepper, tomato, mushroom, amongst other things. It is DELICIOUS. The pizza here is about 2-3$ more than most places but I promise you'll see why. 

They LOAD the toppings on. I have a big appetite and I generally eat 3-4 slices of pizza before I am full but 2 from here is enough for me to enter a food coma. Not only do they put tons of toppings on but they add like an inch of cheese, and the sauce is sooooo goooood. Ahhhhh!! Also, make sure to get the homemade garlic dipping sauce with your pizza. I was so disappointed with pizza delivery in Ottawa but Aladdin's filled that gap thankfully. I'm in Halifax now, the pizza is definitely better here, but I would probably still be a repeat customer if Aladdin's opened up a location here!"}

{"text":"The most incredible pizza of life. A hidden gem on Montreal Rd, visited this place with a friend around 2AM when we has a serious craving for pizza. Pier pulled out a table for us and made us feel as if we were in his kitchen at home. He uses only the finest ingredients and everything is made from scratch. Will be my go to pizza place when visiting Ottawa!"}
{"text":"Best pie yet..., Me and my son love it. so much cheese you gotta take your time eating it otherwise you risk choking!!! Great crust, a bit thick but crispy bottom and croissant like upper crust. I've only had cheese pizza so I can't say anything about toppings, But yeah it's been hard to find a pizza spot as good."}
{"text":"I had gotten a large pepperoni pizza half off, cause when I went there they had made a pizza for pick up but the guy had not come to pick it up and was 15 minutes late. The pizza was soo great... the cheese was layered on.. real thick. The crust was nice and crispy and not too much crust on the ends. Seriously the best pizza I've ever had. I would recommend Aladdins pizza to everyone."}
