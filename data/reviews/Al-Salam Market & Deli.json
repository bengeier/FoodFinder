{"text":"EDIT:  The map is way off.  They're on University City Blvd just northeast of I-485 exit 33.  Great little Middle Eastern market and deli.  They make fresh felafel sandwhiches, among other things.  Great food for take-out.  They also have a fantastic hookah selection.  Plenty of KM hookahs, some Mya ones, and a handful of hand-made hookahs.  Along with good quality bases and bowls.  Their shisha selection and prices are phenominal.  Al Fakhar, Nakhla, and Starbuzz are well represented.  A solid selection of both quick lights and naturals charcoals including Three Kings and Coco Nara.  They must be fairly new because I'm not seeing them listed in many places.  The sign in shopping center (which contains a CiCis), says \"Middle Eastern Deli,\"  Check this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"After getting so many +ive feedback about the quality of meat I went to try out but got disappointed with the quality of the meat.  I specially asked for front goat leg & all I got was bones with very less meat on it & on top of it, it was chewy and quality was low grade ....one-advise Please AVOID this place or check what you are getting"}
