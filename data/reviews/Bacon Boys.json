{"text":"Just ate here this day Cute joint . It's not too big or too small
Party of 5- 3 adults and 2 children. THe where very friendly and attentive. Great food"}
{"text":"Sampled the menu inside the Old Vegas Tavern and it was damn impressive!  I was tortured watching some friends eat it the week previous so had to make a point to return and it wasn't a let down.  In all honestly, this place could be pretty dangerous being so close to where I live!  It's about time we had a good local joint in this area of town!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect at first because I went there thinking, \"Bacon is great, but what more can you do with it?\" The creativity these guys had during my last three visits to their truck BLEW MY MIND and I expect a lot more of it as they keep growing their menu and customer-base. The owner has not only a passion for cooking, but has a vision for where he wants his company to go - not something I usually see in ventures like this. I thoroughly enjoyed their turkey sandwich when I went to their first day out at the First Friday Art Festival and the \"Fluffer-Nutter\" sandwich special they had last week felt like a taboo box-lunch with so much sweetness that a (much) younger me would never have gotten mom's approval while trying to smuggle it to school. If you see them around town, I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"God Bless America and God Bless the Bacon Boys Truck's 'Merica burger.  These guys use some great tasting bacon in their food.  When I was almost done with my burger, one of my guys brings in the FlufferNutter.  They were amazed on how all the flavors came together.  Freakin awesome!!  I'll see you guys sooner than later."}
{"text":"Yo Yo YOOOOO!!!!!!

The DRAGON BLT was the best sandwich I have ever had I swear to GOD....

{"text":"I just had a chance to try their cuisine today. Brian serves food from inside the Old Vegas Tavern(he also owns/operates the \"Bacon Boys\" Food Truck).

I attempted to visit Bacon Boys on Sunday(after reading the other Yelp reviews), but due to being a complete bonehead and being in a hurry I did not go inside the Tavern. Had I done so my craving for a great Bacon Cheeseburger would likely have been quenched 2 days ago. 

Today I tried the 'Merica burger, which is a Bacon Cheeseburger served with a Sunny-Side Up Egg on top. Now let me sing the praises, the burger was damn good. It is served with a more than generous serving of Freedom* Fries. 

I had the pleasure of being served by Brian and Kim. Both of whom went out of their way to make sure I had an exceptional experience. The food is fairly priced.

If I had to make a negative comment it would be that the service was not exceptionally quick. Brian works hard, but perhaps could benefit from a dedicated runner, On the other hand, having a dedicated runner would prevent him from interacting with his customers as much which is what makes his business truly exceptional. 

Additionally, having to pay for the food and drink separately is a pain, but it's not a problem exclusive to this business so I didn't see a need to deduct stars from my review.

The only problem I have is that I'll soon be moving to the East Coast, so I won't be able to be a regular at this place. 

Thank You for an excellent experience.

{"text":"Just tried the new Bacon Burger with a side of the cheddar bacon fries and it was absolutely delicious. I would recommend this to absolutely everyone. Very nice staff and great service! They are very passionate about the food they make and it really shows in every meal they serve. Can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"This place kicks ass! Their service is almost as good as their food. I would recommend something specific but everything I have tried has been terrific, I can't chose lol"}
{"text":"Donut (Dot) Vegas is what I ordered. This was the Best breakfast donut sandwich. Not overly sweet just the right amount of perfect. I will come back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst food truck. Took 45 minutes of waiting to get food... Not worth your time sadly"}
{"text":"Little disappointed. Based on past reviews, I was looking forward to this truck being at Truckin Tueday in Providence. Knowing about this event clearly in advance, they were completely unprepared. I didn't mind waiting if the food was good. But both my husbands burger and mine were undercooked, toppings missing, and they ran out of stuff. We were told if we ordered fries that it would take longer and we agreed, again we didn't mind waiting but they were oily and not worth the extra two dollars to get fifteen fries.  Maybe they would be good at a slower event."}
{"text":"Wow! The Bacon Boys Truck is amazing. They helped us with a corporate event, and went above and beyond to make it extremely successful. We can't say enough great things about their professionalism, the quality of their food, and the fun energy they brought to our event. Thanks, Bacon Boys, for being awesome!"}
{"text":"So last night the GF and I drove 30+ miles across the valley to meet friends at the Bad Beat Brewery.  We sat down at the table and a buddy asked if we were hungry and informed us of a food truck parked outside. More consumed with consuming some Bad Beats brew than consuming food, I said that's cool and that was about it........Fast forward to another buddy saying he was hungry and out the door he went....Fast forward to a happy gentleman walking into Bad Beats with a couple paper trays of whatever.....and then the conversation began.  What are you eating?  Bacon cheeseburger times two and some bacon fries.  What?!  Yeah....it's the Bacon Boys.  First chance I got so as not to appear socially awkward...I was out.  

It was a very short walk over to food truck which was parked next to another brewery in the immediate area.  Now my experiences with other food trucks has not been that great.  I live in a community that has food trucks come and visit from time to time.  My one and only experience sort of sucked.  One would think that a food truck would the epitome of hospitality.  My brief experience would prove not.  Long waits and some to zero personality.

I arrived at the Bacon Boys Truck and started checking things out.  Being that it was just me, I thought perhaps I would get a little more personal attention than I got.  I was a BBT virgin after all. I started to feel that pressure to order but no one wants to get to know you or help you out with an order. O'well....I looked at the computer screen and selected a bacon grilled cheese sandwich, bacon fries, and a bacon wrapped hot dog w/ Sriracha mayo.  All was paid with my AMX.  I thought I would be able to tip, but despite the option being available on the iPad.  The gentleman taking the order closed out the order.  I regret I had no cash to tip him.

I bounced back to Bad Beats and stood by for the order.  In short order....the same happy gentleman appeared bearing the treats I had previously ordered.  Happy, happy, joy, joy!

The GF and I shared everything minus the bacon wrapped dog.  She did not grow up near the border as I did and did not have the same appreciation for bacon wrapped tubed meat as I do.

Bacon, bacon, bacon,,,perfectly cooked. The fries were mostly short variety and required a very specific pinch technique.  This coupled with lack of assistance at the truck brings this down to a four star review.

If your sipping the nectar of the Gods in a commercial park in Hendo or anywhere for that matter..and should your hear of this divine pork wagon slinging it's wares in area...it will absolutely compliment the brew and your state of mind."}
{"text":"Got to go to Bally's today to the foodie fest and Bacon Boys have a station there since the truck is being repaired. Ordered the burger and the Aunt Matilda. They were both very tasty!! Had the bacon fries along with it. Very tasty and it's really enough food for two meals!! I look forward to trying some of their other items! Just remember if you love bacon, this truck is your Mecca!!"}
{"text":"The dragon BLT is the best BLT I have ever had. You must try it! The dressing is spicy/sweet and the perfect compliment to the bacon."}
{"text":"Now in the shops area in front of Bally's this place was awesome, Dragon BLT was delicious and the people running the show were hilarious.

Will defiantly make it back here to try the Aunt Matilda."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the staff was unbelievably generous! I would recommend this to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"If you see the Bacon Boys Truck GO to it! Spin a u turn, jump the curb, speed through an empty lot, whatever it takes MAKE sure you GO to it! You will be so happy you did. The food is amazing obviously with BACON being involved it would be tough to be bad, but some other trucks just don't compare when it comes to Bacon food. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure your experience is AMAZING! If you find something not to your liking (which I am sure you won't) they will take care of you. No chance of you not having a GREAT BACON experience!"}
{"text":"Having a dragon BLT at the great American Foodie pod Las Vegas next to Bally's food is amazing as always"}
{"text":"Soooooooo goooooooooood!!!!!!! 

I look for this truck at every event.  You can buy just strips of bacon also. I usually get the bacon cheese burger with a side of bacon. Brian and his staff are really nice and they get your order out fast.

Thanks guys"}
{"text":"The best food idea to happen since bacon itself!  I gain weight just looking at this, but I will say with complete authority that this is worth a few extra minutes (hours, days?) at the gym to work it off.  Please, PLEASE try the fluffernutter with bacon :)"}
{"text":"Really good! Loved both versions off the grilled cheese and live that they charge an extra fee to subtract bacon!"}
{"text":"Best food truck in Vegas hands down. Great food, prices, and workers. Always worth the wait in line but they turn the food around right away."}
{"text":"Tracked down the bacon boys truck on Ogden and 4th today. Had to try the grilled cheese with bacon and avocado mayo and the Parmesan fries.  Both were to die for.  The the grilled cheese was oozing 3 different cheese and stuffed with just the right amount of crispy bacon. The fries are hand cut and seasoned perfectly. The meal was capped off with grilled flutternutter with bacon. They flambé the marshmallows fluff right in front of you! They also give you the choice of crunchy or smooth peanut butter. This was the highlight on the meal. The combination of sweet and salty hit it right out of the park...thought I died and went to heaven."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat, but I went to check this truck out figuring that I could probably get something without the bacon. I was in the mood for grilled cheese,  and I knew they had it. As it turns out, they dislike vegetarians so much that they literally charge you extra to remove bacon. I don't expect any discount when I ask a place to leave out  an ingredient, but to punish someone for not wanting an ingredient is just ludicrous. They lost out on an easy sale , and one where they would have made a higher profit margin if they just had charged me the same as everyone else."}
{"text":"Chatting with a driver coming from an event, he recommended Bacon Boy.  Of course the driver was the father and husband to Brian and Kathy.  Figure we'd skip a meal at Gordon Ramsey Steak house, we decided to support a local business.  

We didn't realize Bacon Boy was a food truck since his dad said they were in the shopping center near Baileys.  Luckily we ran into them strolling around. 

Had the bacon burger and have to say it was the best burger we've had.  Well with it.  Next time we're in town we'll have to stop by."}
{"text":"The bacon boys truck is something you've got to have! Iv'e tried several menu items and all were delicious. Although, my favorite would have to be the 'Merica burger with their garlic parmesan fries!! Everything is made to order and the staff is super friendly and on top of their game. I'll definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment...bought a deal online for a planned visit to LV.  Sounded so very interesting.  Could not find info on website or FB on where they would be.  E-mailed, called, and texted requesting info on their location in the morning four days ago.  Still have not heard from anyone.  Even drove to the address on the website and had two friends, who had no deal, meet us there.  What a waste of time.  Message on website from owners apologizes for disappointing people.  Recognizing a problem is a start but not doing anything about it is just a poor business practice.  Requested a refund and got it with problem.  Makes us wonder how many others had the same problem."}
{"text":"If you're planning an event and considering a food truck, Bacon Boys is super awesome to work with. We booked them for a tradeshow last week. Brian bent over backwards to get us every single form just short of his first grade report card that the venue asked for. He was also really great about joint marketing and social media to promote the client. In the end, the food and the event was a hit. Thank you guys, you are the best!!"}
{"text":"Bacon, bacon and more bacon!  Very friendly service even with a mob crowd!  We waited awhile for our orders, but well worth the wait!!!!  The best thing we ordered was the bacon wrapped sausage."}
{"text":"Awesome! I mean who doesn't love bacon? 

Several coworkers and I just got lunch here and it was great. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on the truck to see when it's in my area again."}
{"text":"Bacon Boys Truck has catered two community fairs  hosted by Ramirez Group (the company I work for). We had hundreds of attendees at the event- we were lucky to have Bacon Boys great service and delicious food. Having BBT there made lunch time so much easier and everyone was in love with their #baconburger. We definitely recommend you try them and if given the opportunity use them for your events."}
{"text":"Delish! Bacon Boys brought over some amazing bacon.vegas sandwiches this morning at the Metro Chamber! Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"It was really good. Owner was super nice and helpful. Service was great. Fluffernutter sandwich was divine."}
{"text":"Wow is what I keep thinking even a day after eating.  Had the turkey & bacon sandwich which was just Awesome.  The fries with Himalayan salt were perfectly done.  they only bad part was my wife and I almost fought over the last bites.

Will eat with them again anytime."}
