{"text":"I'd never been here before, even though I live literally 2 blocks away.   It's so good to find a hang out in the hood that isn't a sports bar; while there's nothing wrong with Portuguese sports bars in general, I find this part of town intimidating if you are someone who feels out of place in one.  Hence a place like Naco is so thrilling - it's laid back, has a lot of room, and a newly licensed patio.   My friend and I shared the Monday-Tuesday evening special - veggie nachos and two beer bottles for $15, and were quite satisfied.  The nachos had thick warm chips, mushrooms, salsa, sour cream, black beans, and of course a nice jack cheese.  We also each had a specialty cocktail - I had the Catalpa Kiss, which was mango juice, lime, tequila, soda, and salt.  It was quite refreshing, strong enough, and reasonably priced at $6.50.  Her tequila squirt (though oddly named) looked delicious, too.  Tequila, lime, grapefruit, and soda.    They only serve food here until 7 (except for the nachos, somehow) but I really liked the atmosphere, the server/bartender, and the patio.  There's a ton of room inside too for when the whether turns bad.  I'll definitely make this a regular place.  I can't wait to try the brunch and coffee."}
{"text":"what a charming 10+ seater bar and cafe gallery, stopped by last night on the ride home and caught alex mcmaster on cello and 2 unknown dudes ( i'll find out their names) in a wonderful live cello piano vocal set... definately a fan for this part of Brockton...."}
{"text":"Naco sits,  unassuming, along a somewhat drab little stretch of Dundas West between Brock and Lansdowne.  A re-purposed ol' row-house, It's easy to miss.  If you're in the area and looking for a beer, coffee, or nosh, however, missing it would be a sad thing indeed!  This place brims with flavour and charm; pass through the open concept front into the house proper and you'll want to cozy into a chair and spend the day (and/or night!).  More than just a bar and cafe, Naco is a kernel of cultural relevance -- whatever the hell I mean by that I'm not entirely sure, but it sounds nice and I'm certain it's a fair assessment of what Naco's doing.  Outside of the food and drink, they host open mic nights, poetry readings, live music, artists (traditional, live media, etc), and all-in-all support the (awesome) local arts community merely be existing.  On the nourishment side, I highly recommend their coffee (authentic Mexican).  For getting blitzed, go for the Goat's Blood (beet, orange, ginger juice with a healthy dose of vodka), as nothing says substance abuse like ritual sacrifice.  For food... ok, I confess I haven't actually eaten anything here outside of a rather delicious chocolate tart, but what I've *seen* looked AbFab (as the Brits are want to say).  Speaking of not having eaten here... hmm...  ... methinks a brunch be in order!"}
{"text":"Great little nook in an up-and-coming neighbourhood. Try their brunch!"}
{"text":"This is a quirky little place. Charming and eccentric in it's decor.  I wanted to take photos of the decor but their website does much better justice.  On their website, I have to admit, I was lured in by it's menu. I must have missed the details. Sadly, when I wanted to order food the menu was unavailable. The only thing they were serving was veggie nachos or chips and salsa. Another time I will have to try it's Mexican fare.  However, resorting to my favourite elixir to pass the time, coffee. Ordering the coffee at the bar, I had the pleasure of watching him make my brew.  Sadly, it was bitter.  It was still a drinkable cup but I had to get used to the bitter aftertaste it left.  I would return for a few reasons, the food, the atmosphere and the sheer quirkiness of it.    Beware there are three sections to this place - so if you are meeting someone there -  keep walking in!"}
{"text":"I love Naco!!  I love it for being a great coffee shop, I love the service, and I love the cozy night time transformation it makes for comedy and events. It is also a great bar (depending on the night). An all purpose space.    I've had the black bean soup and its delish. I used to spend a lot of time here when I lived in the neighbourhood, and it was a welcome addition.   However, apparently it is closing soon, which is a huge shame! Go now before it's too late!"}
{"text":"Brand new cafe in Brockton Village. Cool artwork inspired space. Ate the mexican brunch (scrambled eggs over tortilla, with delicious home-made black bean soup). Thumbs up."}
