{"text":"I love Rounders staff, food, owners, etc. Today I had their deep fried mushrooms with chunks of garlic and a Cajun mayo dipping sauce.  What a sweet, sweet breath mint this delicious treat is. They are all gone, or I'd take a picture. 
Our other hot , surprising treat is grilled ham and cheese. But...... with garlic aioli and jalapenos.  Wow! Fresh cut fries.... yum. And, it being Sunday,  had a bloody Mary. THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD,  HANDS DOWN!. The price is right, food is GREAT, people are nice(for being people), you won't regret your visit."}
{"text":"Creepy, half-dressed female mannequins right when you walk in.  I felt really out of place being a female in this place.  Sleazy.
Ugh.  NOT going back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood dive bar with a vast selection of liquor and a little less impressive was the selection of draught beer. There were six on tap. A larger selection of craft beers would be a nice addition. The bar was L-shaped with one large TV and a couple smaller ones. There were tables in the room set up more diner style. I'm not sure I'd come for much more than the bar since that is the style and atmosphere. High tops may be more useful with a few more TVs. Even though the interior is somewhat set up as a restaurant, it's definitely a bar crowd. If you bring the kids, they'll learn some new words. 

It was a Saturday afternoon and there were a handful of mature adult patrons inside at the bar. All were welcoming and friendly. There was a small patio where you'd be subject to smoke. The bar tender was attentive and engaging. The owner did come out and chat a bit. He's proud of the scratch cooking they offer. I did find this impressive and will be back to try some of their offerings. The pricing on the menu items looked very fair, and look forward to trying some. We're always looking for somewhere to catch a game and grab a drink and some good bar food!"}
{"text":"Great dinner in town with old and new friends. Couldn't miss Steak night at the Rounders Lounge. This is the place for Tuesday nights and I wasn't disappointed. Owner and chef checked in on us and the rest is of the staff attentive. Don't be fooled by the bar look and feel if you're looking for dinner, this place has great food. Then kick back and enjoy a night cap before heading out. The locals are fun and welcoming."}
{"text":"Clean, small bar. They got rid of the mannequins. New owner's have improved the food selection and quality greatly. Don't be afraid of the motorcycles, good people here. Adult crowd."}
{"text":"nice small bar. serves good food. John is an excellent chief. new management since beginning of 2016 has really done this establishment well. nice place for afternoon lunch. not sure of the night crowd. haven't been there at night."}
