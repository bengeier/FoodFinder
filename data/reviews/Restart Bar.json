{"text":"When I was visiting Scottsdale, my friend recommended Restart Bar for after hiking snack.. I have to say, it was definitely worth it! The customer service was amazing and the staff was super friendly and helpful when I couldn't decide what to get. 
Healthy, delicious and highly recommended it to anyone looking for a yummy snack"}
{"text":"Super cute juice bar! It's connected to a European restaurant called Sonatas! The vibe is trendy and cute and European looking. They even have Russian chocolate at the cashier. I ordered a medium all vital juice and added ginger for 8 dollars. Not bad. Normal price for juice. It's good! I'll have to try more next time. It looks like they also have crepes and coffee and yummy stuff that every girl dreams of. I must come here with my Russian friends soon and see what they think about the vibe! Definitely coming back soon, I can see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening around 6pm. Got an Americano with White Chocolate, and it was delicious! The espresso was smooth with no bitterness whatsoever (rare for phx, I haven't found much I love espresso wise here) , and they actually used the steam wand to blend the white chocolate into the hot water before adding the shots- GENIUS. Also had the Spurgos - some sort of European donut w/ three varying dipping sauces. It was quite good, not overly sweet like most other desserts. 

The venue itself is connected to Sonatas Restaurant. It's a completely different vibe from the cafe portion. Friendly staff, we were told there is live music most evenings at the restaurant and given a 25% off coupon to dine at the restaurant. Attentive manager! Even though we were the only ones in the cafe area, and there was lots going on in the restaurant area, we felt well attended to. There's a large variety of things on the menu for the cafe - will have to be back during a lunch hour to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to give a 5 because the food was delicious and very well presented! However, when we went yesterday mid morning they did not have bananas and we were told they were not serving acai bowls because they didn't have all the ingredients. The pastries were also extremely limited. The cashier/barista working seemed very distracted - my friend had to point out where on the menu the Nutella syrup was and also had to tell her how to enter an AmEx card number (their card reader was down). Then when our food was prepared and sitting in the window, we had to get up both times and ask her to give it to us. We were also there as another customer was complaining about being overcharged and saw another potential customer walk out during that situation. The main restaurant is beautiful, though, and the food was amazing, so I will definitely be back to give it another try."}
