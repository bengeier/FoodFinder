{"text":"\"Poor customer service and the food was just okay\"

My wife went to pick up Take Out on February 27, 2014.

Stella waited on her. Prior to making our order, my wife produced her Government ID that exempts her from the tax. Stella said she didn't understand. Another employee explained to Stella that my wife is exempted from paying the tax. Stella told my wife that she will take the order and make the adjustment. When it was time to pay, the tax was on the bill, my wife pointed it out and Stella said, they don't exempt the tax. My wife decided since it was getting late, she would proceed.

Our order consisted of the following:

Sweet & Sour Chicken balls - They were okay but a bit too greasy.
Soo Gai - It was okay, but lacked flavour and was a bit too greasy.
Golden Chicken Wings - They had the typical chicken wing flavour, nothing special.

We also found the food to be very heavy, that bloated feeling after eating it.

We decided to try Paul Wong's because of their mostly positive reviews and the fact that it is difficult to find good Chinese food in the GTA. Now that we have and taking into consideration that they are pricey, the food is nothing special, greasy and heavy, along with the poor customer service, we will not patronize Paul Wong's again.

Unfortunately, the best Chinese food we've had has been from Far East Chinese Restaurant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Whenever we visit Niagara Falls, we always go there and the food has always been consistently very good, not over priced, nor greasy and heavy and the customer service is pretty good. 

I hope my review is helpful. 

God bless,

{"text":"I've been living in Pickering for over 20 years and Paul Wongs is by far the best Chinese food I've had. The whole family loves it. It is surprising how many local residents haven't tried it yet. I still recommend this place to many new residents. If you are ordering for New Year's Day make sure you call a few hours in advance. They are extremely busy that day. everything on the menu is great. The chicken balls, Schezchun  shredded beef, vegetable fried rice, breaded shrimp just to name a few are all great. You won't be disappointed. Trust me!"}

This is where Chinese Food goes and dies!!!  I should have been a bit more astute by the hue of blue hair upon entering and the shades of pastel but alas i was meeting my 72 year old mother who for some reason that doesn't have logic recommended that we meet there for lunch.

It has the feel of lunch time at Leisure World.  The waiter was a complete ass***le.  There would be 5 of us for lunch and mom got there before the rest of us and asked for a table that was in the middle and not squishy according to her comfort level.  The waiter had none of it and stuck her at a four that was crammed at the side where she really had a hard time moving her chair in and out.   I of course asked to be moved to a 5 seat table   that was done with a curt, \"I told  HER  that she couldn't sit there\"  Who the hell is \"her\"  nice manners babe.

The food:

Beef with Broccoli (came with snow peas??)
Lemon Chicken (deep fried frozen chicken with lemon sauce)
Cantonese Chow Mein (no shrimp, pork) Veggies consisted of diced frozen carrotts, peas and celery.  Package yukky sticky noodle not fried properly.
Hot and Sour Soup (again something i don't think they serve too often) asked to take away loaded with MSG  sooo salty
Wonton Soup,  can broth with frozen dumplings
egg rolls (comes with all meals) ok
Rice (ask for steam rice) got some fried crap with frozen veggies again.

The bill was $55??!!  Each dish was enough for maybe 2 people, not that we cared because the food was the worst I have ever had.   

Note:  on observation every table seemed to be having the fried chicken balls with neon red sauce over fried rice for $5.95 that came with soup.

Stay far away!!  Not that you want to go to Pickering for lunch but if your ever stuck go to McD's drive-thru which is in abundance in the burbs and you will at least know what to expect and what to $$$."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. I first have to note that this is not your authentic style Chinese restaurant. Although the decor and staff is authentic, obviously since its pickering they are not catering to Chinese people. It is however a great place to get your american style Chinese fix. Their food (although pricey), is consistently clean and delicious. 

I usually go to Scarborough for my authentic Chinese dishes, but when I want some good ol Cantonese Chow mein, General Taos Chicken, Sweet and Sour anything, this is the place I go to, and have been for years.

They give cash/pickup order discounts."}
{"text":"- in a town where legit (non-Mandarin buffet houses) are a few, i'm not sure how to rate paul wong
- went for take-out a few weeks ago, and although the staff was definately hong kong folks, there was something not 100% right with the food.
- however, the beef and tomato was the only thing spot on... very reminicent of how my mother makes it.
- i understand that this is a p-town staple... 
- 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"If you have the option, go elsewhere 

This place is pretty terrible. I've had a lot of Chinese food and this was probably one of the worst. Not only was it not authentic at all, it was just plain bad food. Two stars is generous. All the food except the chili shrimp was bland and very white. The noodles were soggy and falling apart even though there was little to no sauce to give it flavor. Although this could have been because it was a take out order, but I've had many take out orders that didn't have this problem. The veggies in the chow mein were also limp and dry and everything with ginger in it had a strange earthy taste like it hadn't been washed well enough. Out of the 5 dishes we ordered, the only saving grace was the shrimp which was decent; the shrimp were plump and the flavour was decent. 

To top it off, the price is WAY more than even good Chinese food should be. $80 for 5 dishes that are almost all bad? Come on. Long story short, you should save your money and make better food at home."}
{"text":"I've been going to Paul Wong's for a number of years. Not often, but once or twice a year. The menu covers your basic Chinese fare and has always been excellent. The prices are in line with other other establishments. The service is always very good, except on Christmas eve, it can be a nightmare. Whether it's take-out or in the dinning room arrive early and expect to wait. Any other time of the year there's no issue."}
{"text":"Last time I ate Paul wings (over 6 years ago) the Cantonese chow main I ordered made me throw up. NO LONGER A FAN"}
{"text":"I really like this Chinese restaurant. The food is always fresh, it taste great, and we have enjoyed both dining in and taking out. The service is great. Definitely would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have only ever gotten takeout at Paul Wong's.  While I think House of Wong in Scarborough is better, Paul Wong's a close second.  Very delicious.  Not much to really critique about the everyday Chinese food menu, but if you are craving Chinese and live in Pickering, this is the place to go for good takeout."}
{"text":"My famliy has been ordering from Paul Wongs for years and quite frankly, I've yet to find Chinese food that rivals the deliciousness that you can get here.

We don't tend to eat in the restaurant, although every time we have we've had prompt, attentive service and fantastic food. I think most people don't tend to eat in as every time I've been in to pick up our takeout, the takeout area is FULL. If that doesn't say something about the food here, I don't know what else does. Not many places where people will line up for takeout in PICKERING.

Our usual dishes include: Cantonese Chow Mein, Chicken Balls, Honey Garlic Spareribs, House Dep Voy, Chicken Fried Rice, Egg/Springrolls. All of these have been family favourites for years but in recent past we've started to expand and try out other menu items. 

Don't ask me why but the chicken wings are delicious from Paul Wongs - not something we'd usually order but on a whim, we gave them a shot and they were awesome. The dumplings are great but really need to be eaten IN the restaurant, dumplings just aren't the same after a 10 minute drive home. I'm not a big beef person but the Szechuan beef was pretty good and rather spicy. The Chili Chicken is a new addition and it was WONDERFUL - crispy and very spicy, we cleaned the container out in one sitting. 

The food at Paul Wongs is a cut above your standard chinese food. It's not greasy, its always tasty and hot and well prepared. Again, eating in, I've never had a bad experience, but its not something we do often. If you're getting takeout, make sure you call ahead and its best to pay cash if you want to get in and out if there's big line ups. I've had lots of terrible chinese food, and this is the furthest thing from it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered some take out from this place today. For the price they charge. I was expecting really good food. Was I wrong! The food was garbage the dogs would not even eat it. It's a good thing I didn't order the lobster. They wanted $38 for one lobster tail!!!  Are you kidding me. If you want good Chinese food go to Conga Wong's you can get real lobster chow mien with one whole lobster for under $20 and it's great. 

Done waste your money at this place Paul Wong (Paul Wrong)!!!  

I would give them a minus 2 stars!!"}
