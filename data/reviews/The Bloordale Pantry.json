{"text":"About a year ago, Bloor and Lansdowne saw the closing of its neighbourhood institution: The Dale. The Dale had been serving 'greasy spoon' diner food in the neighbourhood for nearly 60 years, but what emerged from behind the brown paper and dressing screens of a renovation was so much better.  The Bloordale Pantry, opened by young couple Rose and Anthony, has moved this venue from institution to gem. A lot of love went into this place; and not only love for their little diner, but also love for the neighbourhood in which it sits.  Upon entering, the greeting was warm and friendly, which wouldn't be strange as my guest and I have eaten there a couple of times, but you don't need to be a regular to feel at home; every one of their guests seems to be rewarded with a warm smile and happy hello.  The room is decorated with local art mixed with diner kitsch. It's all brought together by red vinyl booths lining one wall, and an old dinerstyle counter and stools lining the other.  The menu's main theme is diner food with an all day breakfast and lots of sandwiches, but it's all updated regularly and prepared well. It also features a lot of Italian fare with both a panini and pasta section.  On a recent visit, my guest tried the 'Mac'n'Cheese', which she thought was cheesy and good, albeit needing a little more flavour. My Bloordale Brisket sandwich was sloppy and well cooked--as it should be! The brisket meat was tender, but not falling apart. The barbeque sauce was a little sweeter than I generally like, but overall the sandwich was filling and comforting just like diner food is supposed to be. Served with their expertly seasoned and perfectly crisp French fries and creamy coleslaw, it was quite a large portion.  Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and with a menu that has vegetarian options and interesting daily specials, like meatloaf, 'Jalapeno Popper' burger or house cured trout, The Bloordale Pantry pretty much offers something for everyone."}
{"text":"Really liked it.   Atmosphere was clean and funky  Buddy had the breakfast burger, said it was great.   I had the house burger with fries, which was one of the best burgers I'd had in weeks.   Server was on her game, friendly and low key cool.... (clownish wait staff always annoy me)  Thanks Bloordale Pantry, I'll be back"}
{"text":"I came here for the second time in as many visits to Toronto - most recent one being earlier in the week during the heat (stroke) wave. First time I believe was right around the time they had just opened up...  I wish I had tried a wide variety of dishes in each of those trips to give a more detailed review on their dish offerings but unfortunately I had the Huevos Rancheros each visit. My friend did comment that her veggie burger was quite good.  Huevos rancheros. So, it's just a taco dish that throws on some eggs right? It's so simple it hurts. But they're amazing and I am powerless over them when presented with an option to order the aforementioned dish. And it doesn't hurt that these guys do it justice. Never thought I would have such great quality huevos rancheros in the NE.  Nevertheless, I enjoy coming here because the food is delicious, coffee is good, atmosphere is laid back and chill and the servers are rather attentive and nice. I think I ended up having about 6 refills in my last visit - needless to say I left the restaurant very wired. But it was nice that my water glass and coffee mug was constantly being refilled without having to flag someone down!"}
{"text":"I like it here. It has a nice diner vibe without being overly retro-fetishist.  I have only been once so far. The service was super good and the eggs and potatoes were yummy. I liked the lightly grilled tomato slice.  It was a very cheery place to spend a Sunday morning catching up with a friend. The music was a bit bouncy so if you need a mellower mood, be forewarned.  They were making beautiful-looking, boozy breakfast drinks at the bar but I had errands and chores so stuck to coffee - an excellent americano. Next time :)"}
{"text":"Hate this stupid place. Bad service. Bad food. I have a few friends who like it but I'm pretty sure they're idiots."}
{"text":"I've had this review in my 'unfinished' list for quite some time, so I think I'd better complete it.  Bloordale is pretty new - so I would love to forget my first to experiences there.  The second of which - after eating a forgettable and regular breakfast - one of the waif waitresses offered us one of their freshly baked cookies - we said okay.  When we paid and she returned with the large cookie in a bag, she said, \"Sorry, but it's just a bit burned (insert nervous laughter), the cook accidentally hit the tempurature guage with his belly (more awkward laughter).\"   This struck us as completely weird, and said nothing - but walked out and had a bite of the cookie.   WHY WOULD SHE TELL US THIS????  Yes, it was burned, and it tasted like the cement we were walking on at the Bloor/Lansdowne corner - which many of you might know as having it's own flavour entirely!  ***  I've been back since, and their breakfast has vastly improved, and so has their service, although the serving staff can be oblivious to their body language and etiquette."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday with two friends on a Sunday. This place is insane, I heard that they have a long line up every weekend, but we arrived at like 10:20AM, and we had to wait although we were like the second in line, but keep in mind, they opened their door at 10am, not 8, not 9... So my advice is either come with a smaller group, or arrive around 11am ish so you can get a table when the first wave finishes their breakfast.  I tried their special of the day, which uses ingredients from local ontario farms (great option for those who supports local produce) It got two eggs, their homemade english muffin (that taste more like pancake), bacon, home fries, some fruits, and rabbit sausage. The rabbit sausage was so good! It's a big plate! So you will definitely good until supper time!  I also ordered a cappuccino, well I'm not a fan of foam, but my server made it extra foamy.   Service was good, we didn't make any special request, so I guess that wasn't tested ...    One note is I think they change their menu very often. So, instead of printing menu books, they use table sheet as their menu...and they do re-use them...so one of the sheets they gave us is dirty and they still recycle that. Also, because they change their menu often, pictures on yelp doesn't really apply. But I guess that's a good thing for people who always go back (or not, if they really like what they had last time)"}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    In a city flooded with hipster breakfast spots, it's quite nice to see that a new one is doing well by serving good food at decent prices with efficient and friendly service. The Bloordale Pantry does everything you want it to do: $10 breakfasts feature eggs, potatoes, with meat or veggies. The coffee's decent. They're doing everything right. The only reason they're a 3, and not a 4, is because they don't really offer anything special for my taste. If you're in the area and you want a good safe meal with reliable service, go to this place.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast. Comfy, bright, full of hipsters. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I was very excited when The Bloordale opened up and my first few meals there were fantastic.  The staff was very friendly, and the restaurant had a warm atmosphere.  The fresh squeezed juices were delicious and their hot sauces were amazing.    Unfortunately though, I've had several meals since then that were less than subpar.  I wasn't going to give a poor review because the staff are pretty nice and the place does have some redeeming qualities, but I've given this restaurant more than enough opportunities to prove itself.  The last Bloordale brisket sandwich that I ordered from them was half filled with fat.  I ended up throwing out half the sandwich.  It wasn't even half fat, half meat.  It was large slices of solid fat.  I thought I was being picky, but when I showed my boss, he said it was pretty disgusting.  The side salads have always been less than impressive.  I had the pumpkin spice pancakes several times and they were very tasty, but the last time I had them, they were cold.  One time I ordered the Boada sandwich and I received an entirely different meal than what I ordered.  They reimbursed me for my trouble and also gave me a free meal which was very nice.    However, today I ordered the Canadian Breakfast Sandwich (because the sausage patty on it is out of this world) but when I received the take-out order, the sandwich was covered in strawberry juice from 2 strawberries that were in with the meal.  The problem is, I'm allergic to them.    When I returned the meal, I was told that \"I should have informed them\" of my allergy.  Ordinarily, I notify a restaurant that I'm allergic to strawberries.  However, when I've ordered from them over a dozen times and never had fruit come withany meals (nor was it listed on the menu with my sandwich), it's fair to say that I wasn't expecting it.    How would I sum up The Bloordale?  Consistently inconsistent."}
{"text":"Love having this little joint in our area - the breakfasts are great especially the pancakes sooo good! The coffee keeps flowing and the service is so nice! Great tunes, fun atmosphere - this is our go-to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch a several weeks ago with admittedly modest expectations and was very pleasantly surprised on all fronts.   Having been burned oh so many times by places that choose to evoke the retro-diner/faux greasy spoon aesthetic my culinary guard went up as soon as we walked in.  The friendly, super-competent, unpretentious server allayed some of those fears - when it was discovered that she was a co-owner I began to relax.    Things I liked:  - The eggs; All of the egg dishes we top notch, well plated, and offered good value for money  - The staff; friendly and competent  - Wall art; local and inspiring  - Hot sauces; lots of good ones and a super nice home made variety  Things that need improvement:  - The coffee; they need better beans - call Te Aro  - Bread - With a half dozen top notch Portuguese bakeries within walking distance they can do much better than what they have and probably even save money  This is one of those reviews where I really wish the half star was an option.  While definitely 4 stars for lunch, the bread and coffee issues definitely lower the rating for breakfast.    The owners seem to truly care and I believe that deserves the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"When oh when will Yelp allow half stars? Cause this place is a solid 3.5   Arrived around 11 on a Sunday- prime brunch time. There were 6 of us, but the friendly servers were able to accommodate us after a few minutes' wait. The decor in here is perfect- comfy red booths, old mismatched chairs, and lots of art on the walls. Service is good- the place was fairly busy but we never felt neglected.  Coffee is ah-mazing. Cute espresso machine on the bar that will make whatever your hungry heart desires. And even though it doesn't say so on the menu, you can get regular drip coffee if you're having a frequent-refill kind of morning.   The one area where the Pantry loses points for me is in the menu. It's just a bit...blah. Your standard eggs-n-bacon, bennys, pancakes kind of stuff, with a few breakfast sammies you could whip up at home thrown in. When I go out for brunch, I like to try things I wouldn't bother to make/wouldn't have the ingredients on hand for at home, and sadly there was none of that here.  That said, all of the food came out quickly and was tasty. The hashbrowns are great, and they throw a few pieces of fresh fruit on the plate. A great place to hang out and grab a meal with friends, but not something I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Awe... :(   I wanted to write a nice review for this place -- I even bookmarked it to review -- even though all we got were take-away London Fogs and brownies I could tell this place had a nice, relaxed atmosphere and the woman behind the counter was super chatty and hospitable - as long as we let her talk about herself...   Sadly my brownie contained enough egg shells that I couldn't really enjoy it. I'll give the Bloordale Pantry another go next time I'm in the neighbourhood and will hopefully report back that this was a one time faux-pas... Until next time."}
{"text":"Tell me what YOU think! The place is busy and the food is average breakfast/lunch fare. Apparently one waiter there is brilliant. He wasn't there the day we went. But we doubt it would've helped. We guessed that the history of the joint is that somebody taught the owner how to make eggs. She opened a small place in an area devoid of any breakfast places. Bingo. Ka-ching! $$. So these days the owner is in the dining room, smiling. That smile covers up a lot, including the fact she seems to like money more than pleasing groups of guests.   We waited well over an HOUR one bustling Saturday morning. Finally seated, (we stayed on top of the wait staff who were letting guests who'd well finished their breakfast wait at their table for a take out order) -- we told our waiter that somebody in our party was experiencing hyperglycemia because of the long wait and could we get some scones or bread?  \"I'm the owner,\" she smiled benignly. \"We don't have scones I'm afraid.\" ANYTHING? Yes, they make griddle cakes. Great! Two please. They came out after ten minutes, our breakfast took half an hour (\"food is guaranteed to take half an hour\"  to come out of the kitchen she smilingly told us), fine. What was particularly upsetting was, in spite of our hungry grumbles, a refill of coffee was charged for. Is this good business etiquette? I think not. A small offer of a coffee or the order of griddle cakes on the house would have appeased us, but the four of us, unhappily left and declared we would never ever return. Customer service stinks!"}
{"text":"Bloordale Pantry  Going into Bloordale Pantry is like stepping into the Cheers bar-Where everyone knows your name. However, they do not shout it out at you=)  Rose, the owner and all of her staff are charming and fabulous.  This is one of my favourite brunch joints in Toronto.  Located at Bloor and Lansdowne (or as I call it, the blo-downe), it is a wonderful addition and welcomed gentrification to this \"up and coming\" area.  Such a lovely attempt to offset all of the nearby nudie bars.  Bloordale pays homage to classic diners with leather booths and kitschy retro knick knacks adorning the walls.  The menu is fairly diverse for brunch-prices ranging from $8/plate to $18 per entree.  The coffee is great and they offer delicious dry sodas.  With Jason DJ-ing from his ipod/computer and taking requests, the music is always fantastic.  On weekends they have awesome specials-the best is the huevos rancheros-with vegetarian/vegan options as well.  I highly recommend the pumpkin spice pancakes with maple whip cream, the perfect autumn brunch that will fill your stomach and warm your soul.  The customer base ranges from young hipsters to new families to the elderly.  Everyone is welcome at Bloordale. I highly recommend this establishment! But make um understand its Westside foe life! Thanks so much for your time"}
{"text":"Friendly, courteous service, yummy hamburgers, ambitious and delicious specials, relaxed atmosphere. I don't share their taste in music, but it's still one of my favourite places to treat myself to lunch. I cant get there for the highly popular brunch, but I recommend checking out the quiet weekday afternoons. Basic coffee is okay, but espresso-based drinks are best purchased elsewhere."}
{"text":"How do you spend a birthday when you're working evenings? By going to brunch of course! I'd heard so much about the Bloordale Pantry, enough to grumble about how the neighbourhood was completely lacking brunch places when I lived there a few years ago, but I figured now was as good a time as any to stop by.  Weekday brunch is a little different than weekends, but I was starving after a 30 minute walk and tucked into my Roadside Breakfast, finishing every last morsel. Three different kinds of meat were on my plate; bacon, back bacon and the tastiest slab of farmers sausage I've had at a brunch place. My eggs were fried all right and the rye bread was plentiful!   Service was attentive and my coffee mug wasn't empty once the entire time. I wish I had space for their brownies or cookies but unfortunately/fortunately I was quite full from my breakfast.   My only complaint is that ONE fried tomato slice does not count as \"fried tomatoes\" that was a bit shockingly skimpy, especially considering the size of the farmers sausage."}
{"text":"Thank god, I can finally get an amazing brunch in  the area.  My BF and I decided to check this place out last weekend and we will definitely be back.  The decor is cute old school diner and the server was great. Not 'server friendly',  but actually friendly, which is a huge at brunch when you're feeling a bit rough.  We both ordered the special, eggs benedict on wild mushroom risotto cakes.  These were out of this world good, like lick your plate good.  It can be hard to get an inventive vegetarian breakfast, so this was extra bonus points.  The only downside is that when the bill came they were $15 each which is more than I like to spend on a brunch entree.  Still, the rest of the menu is reasonably priced and I get that wild mushrooms aren't free, so it's understandable.  I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu, and hope it's as good as my first visit suggests."}
{"text":"Well, Bloordale continues to be our go-to brekkie joint in the 'hood, but they still haven't fixed their damned bread shortcomings (as Howard H. has also pointed out)!  In any case, I wanted to add a potentially useful tidbit of information:  With a group (I assume six or more), BDP charges a mandatory 20% gratuity, and there didn't seem to be a mention of it anywhere on the menu (we were not notified).  20% is a bit presumptuous, I think, but we're accustomed to pretty great service at BDP... so while the service this time around left a bit to be desired, I'll shrug and let it slide.  (For the record, we usually tip between 20-30% here.)  Just thought this'd be useful information for potential diners!"}
{"text":"Very cute place! The restaurant was already packed when we got there at 10:30am on a Sunday. We waited about 30 minutes to get a table. Staff was really nice and went into detail on describing the menu items. They seem to have alot of daily specials that weren't featured on the menu. Very unique things like rabbit sausage, biscuits etc. I had the smoke salmon benedict and the peameal bacon benedict - both were delicious. The sides were nothing to rave about, just your standard home fries and salad. The cappucino was good. The rabbit sausage was delicious!   Too bad they don't take reservations. But I guess that's to be expected from a popular place like this! Will be back soon for more :)"}
{"text":"The Bloordale Pantry has replaced The Dale on the South-East corner of Bloor and Lansdowne. (I'm not sure where the dealers and addicts will loiter now.) The Bloordale Pantry keeps all the diner charm of The Dale, while updating the space so it's not so busted looking. There is a nice mix of new and old in the diner.  I arrived on the evening of their first night being open. Unlike the Dale, The Bloordale Pantry has a full blown espresso machine. I tried an americano and chatted with the waitress about the newly opened space. There aren't too many spots to get a good coffee in Blansdowne, so this new addition is welcome. Americanos pair will with Brunch, which the Bloordale also serves. I'll have to come back and check that out soon.  The americano was good, and the wait staff were friendly, so I decided to come back for dinner a few hours later. I had the pulled pork sandwich, with fries and coleslaw. It was really good; the fries in particular were really tasty. Apparently the menu will change week to week. Everything is made fresh in house.  I've been since for both brunch and dinner. For the brunch I thought i'd be adventurous and try the vegan pancakes. It was an experience, though i'm not sure i'd try them again. For my second dinner there I tried the burger. It's 100% ground chuck, no filler. Now that's a tasty burger.  This place is definitely one more reason to venture out to Blansdowne."}
{"text":"Food's pretty good. Very big portions. Their specials are always a novelty. Service is a bit lacking though. Went with a few friends who have been loyal customers of this place. The server only cared to be \"friendly\" with them and ignored the rest of us who were new to the place. Not very amicable to begin with I would say. The second time I went to the place, it was super packed. So be sure to arrive at 10 am  on weekends! (when the restaurant opens). I ordered scrambled eggs. Twenty mins later they came with sunny side up eggs. However, the waitress was quite polite when I pointed it out. Food is 4 stars. I would have given a higher rating if the service was a bit better."}
{"text":"Where do you take someone from a birthday brunch on a weekday in the west end? The Bloordale Pantry!  My espresso? Solid. The day's special: salisbury steak and eggs? Great! The assortment of hot sauces on the table? Exactly what I needed.    My partner got the big Roadside Breakfast with the idea that she wouldn't eat everything and I'd take care of the leftovers. Too bad for me there weren't any!"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to the Bloor Lansdowne Area. Dinner for two comes at a reasonable price - we had 3 courses and were extremely satisfied. The asparagus appetizer was excellent. I and the polenta with sweet potato and sausage as a main which was good, not spectacular but still enjoyable. The burger on the other hand was excellent. The dessert (mango berry tart) was slightly disappointing - mushy pastry and canned fruit - and I wouldn't recommend it. Other than that , Bloordale Pantry is still one of those spots that I will definitely try again - the food is wholesome and the service and atmosphere are excellent. The brunch sounds interesting and the coffee looks promising.  Kudos to the owner for opening this in what is still a somewhat troubled area!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the west end. Service is fast and friendly. Great daily specials. And best eggs benny around! Don't be a starving artist. Head to the bloordale!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe I haven't reviewed Bloordale yet! I frequent this fine establishment for weekend brunch. It has an old-school diner feel but tastes sooo much better. My go-to meal is the veggie Huevos Rancheros (to which you can also add delicious pulled pork) but other fantastic options include the Pumpkin Spice Pancakes, the bennies, or your typical B&E.  Staff is very personable and great with their descriptions of the specials... sidenote: always opt for anything with double-smoked bacon.  I sometimes stop in to grab a coffee and am always tempted by whatever treats they happen to have in the case on the counter.  Always coming up with interesting new menu items and specials, Bloordale Pantry will never let us get bored of their selection."}
{"text":"As much as I like the low key, yet original look and feel of the Bloordale Pantry, it never seems to be open when I come a'knockin. On one of my most recent visits, they even announced that they were going to close up early for some emergency maintenance. Maybe it's not all chocked up to me sleeping in after all!  Regardless of all that, their food is good once you're in. Their menu features tasty diner staples such as all day breakfasts, classic sandwiches, and really big, juicy burgers. The service is friendly and the place is always neat and clean."}
{"text":"You know that feeling? Yeah, that one. The feeling of hope you get when you see another valiant hipster business pop up in a scrungy stretch? \"I hope that place does well.\" you think before you even walk in the door. That new cafe/clothing collective/book store has more hopes pinned on it than tails to a donkey at a child's birthday party. Then NOW Magazine reviews the place and you can breathe a sigh of relief. I'm still in that awkward hopeful stage with The Bloordale Pantry.   I was walking home from my last day of school (a yearly tradition) when I glimpsed a retro, red dining booth through a window. Any touch of '50s diner memorabilia or kitsch is enough to lure me in to a restaurant. I walked in and was instantly greeted by the owner of the restaurant. I feel terrible that I've forgotten her name but I've been procrastinating this review for a while. I ordered a berry -apricot tart and we talked about the gentrification of the area. The tart was delicious, the fruit was sweet but the natural tartness still came through. I finished our conversation by telling the owner about Yelp, she'd never heard of it! I would love to go back and sample their lunch menu and see what their impressive espresso machine can do."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with The Bloordale Pantry. The tables were comfy and it had a homey feel.   The staff was nice, and worked at a relaxed pace. I ordered the regular hamburger and it was well-proportioned (not scary big, more like a sandwich that happened to be a hamburger). The meat tasted really fresh, the bread was good and it was tasty. The coleslaw was pretty average. I thought the french fries were pretty okay but they certainly seemed fresh and some of my dining mates thought they to be tasty.   I left my water bottle inside the restaurant and our waitress ran down the street after me.   Overall super nice people, good food. If they had more soups and non-breakfast specials it would have been a home run for me."}
