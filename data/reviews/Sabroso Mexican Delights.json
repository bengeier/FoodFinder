{"text":"These are legit tacos, in fact the best I've had in the burgh. I had shredded chicken and then the Barbacoa and they were both amazing. You can choose between \"mexican\" and \"american\" toppings which was nice cause I had my kids with me.

Not a lot of room on Saturdays when the strip district is a zoo, but it's worth the trek."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing people. Finally found some good Mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Delicious taco truck in the strip district. Chorizo, carnitas, and chicken tacos were great. Huarache was good, but smaller than we expected - not as much bang for your buck. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Good taco truck in the heart of the strip! We had the carnita on a corn tortilla and it had good flavor. Instead of choosing American or Mexicano toppings alone, we asked for everything on it... that was the right call! The meat was tender and the hot sauce has a nice kick!

There usd only one table, so it's a stand and eat kind of place.also, it is cash only, so I was lucky to scrounge up enough to get the $2.50 taco!"}
{"text":"Best tacos since San Diego. Real street tacos with fresh ingredients. We will be back. 
Carnitas were delicious! 
Be prepared to eat on the bench or get food to go."}
{"text":"Nice!  Really good tacos....made to order with all the toppings except the salsa.  The salsa comes in a squeeze bottle in mild, medium or hot.  Had the medium and it was standard medium; may try the hot next time.  Had the chorizo and carnitas Mexicano style.  These tacos are on par with Las Palmas and a couple of other taco stands in the area.  If you like real street tacos with fresh ingredients this is a good stop.
There are a couple of tables and and awning cover them so you can eat at the table as everyone walks by on the sidewalk or take it with you."}
{"text":"Food truck with decent food in the strip district. Food is good with reasonable price."}
