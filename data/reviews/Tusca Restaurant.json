{"text":"Average at best. The atmosphere was good but I went there for lunch and the food had nothing special to it. Their chopped salad was the worst thing ive ever had at a restaurant. It tasted like some Cole slaw gone bad.  I've never been there for dinner or drinks but for lunch it's not worth it. You will be happier with subway or pita pit which is close by and not as disgusting."}
{"text":"This place gets one star for the Sangria which was pretty good. As far as the food goes it was terrible. Does the cooks in the back not know what salt and pepper is? None of the food had any flavor. It was like upscale hospital food. The two shrimp dishes we ordered had the smallest shrimp I had ever seen. Popeyes has bigger popcorn shrimp. To make things worse none of the food was cheap. We ended up spending $100+ after tip for the worst meal I had ever had. I should of listened to my gf and took her to Cheesecake Factory. It may be a chain but its a 100 times better than Tusca. They need to send a representative from Tusca to a real Tapas restaurant to take some notes. It seems like some idiot chef created all of their crappy dishes. This place needs to call the FOX network to have Chef Ramsey come in and turn it around."}
{"text":"I came into this place wanting to like it - I like tapas.    This place was not good.  While it has great location and an uncluttered interior, the food just does not live up to its surroundings.  In fact, you could say that the food is downright ...  not good - definitely fusion food gone wrong!  We got 6 different tapas to share amongst 4 people.  3 specials for the night and we tried 2 - the mahi with pineapple and prosciutto with chanterelle pizza.  We also got the mussels, rigatoni bolognese, flat iron steak (medium rare) and the margherita pizza.  Let me just describe them like this:  tasteless and slightly overcooked; good but a little too salty; nothing special (I've had much much better); ehh; overcooked and tasteless and frankly much too overpriced for what you got.  I had to save the margherita pizza description for last --- a white cheese pizza with COLD tomato sauce poured on top.  Oh, with 6 pieces of basil strewn atop.  Margherita??  Isn't that supposed to have actual tomatoes as described on the menu?  The manager of the restaurant didn't even seem bothered by this even though she said she would \"check on it\".  Please, save yourself from disappointment.  Don't bother eating here.    This place got 2 stars because the service, decor and location were all ok.  Oh, and the sangria is just ok."}
{"text":"One star for decor and good service.   For tapas in Pittsburgh, this is the worst. There's no focus with it....they simply seem to be firing their tapas gun in every direction...and when you try to do everything you usually fail. Strange flavors (not good strange), bad/sloppy presentation, and very overpriced for what you get.   Walk down the street to Ibiza on Carson, or Dish Osteria Bar on Sarah St for great Tapas and equally good atmosphere. Southside has a decent amount of great tapas......Tusca is not part of that group."}
{"text":"I guess it's closed from what I here...thank god.  This place was awful.  Dirty and disgusting to look at.  The food was a joke.  The \"cooks\" and managers looked homeless.  The drinks were terrible too...hard to screw that up, but they did.  The one best word to describe is digusting."}
{"text":"Not so impressed with the tapas.    - Ordered the cheese plate which doesnt come with bread or crackers. - Some other items are overpriced ( dont order the yucatan shrimp). - the fried artichokes are pretty good."}
{"text":"I went to Tusca on a great recommendation, and was sorely disappointed. The sangria was great, and a definite highlight.   The service was okay, I guess. Our server was trying to be funny, nice, and was trying waaay too hard. He didn't seem to get that we weren't \"that kind\" of table.   I totally could have overlooked all of that, but the food was awful! We ordered the olives, which came covered in powdered Parmesan cheese. The Gorgonzola mashed potatoes had zilch for flavor. And this isn't a a cheap restaurant. I'm all about fusion, and will happily pay for quality, but Tusca totally failed!  I agree with the Julie D. who said they seem to put the same garlic EVOO on everything. Honestly? It seemed a little like Olive Garden, or Cheesecake Fac. Overpriced, poor service, and fake foodies (the staff, not the customers - side note, the table next to us sent at least two dishes back).   I would definately go back for sangria and outdoor seating (it was cold when I went), but would eat before I go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant during a quite Saturday afternoon for lunch. The location is nice, close to small shops. The ambiance was not bad, nor was the service. I had the fried artichoke and pizza, which were both really good. My husband had white bean/chickpea dish, which was a bit bitter for his taste. Overall better than expected!"}
{"text":"I have to write this because this was probably one of my best experiences trying to eat gluten free in Pittsburgh. My husband and I went there tonight and they offered a great gluten free menu, something that is often very hard to find. I had the mushroom risotto, which was fantastic.  Then, they told my they had a gluten free chocolate lava cake. I almost cried. It was to die for.  I will definitely be coming back. This is a great place for anyone, but I especially encourage my GF friends to try it."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 6 times and I have to say its one of my favorite unique restaurants in the Burgh!  My boyfriend and I both like it here and our standard order is calamari (great aioli, tender meat), chopped salad (rather basic but very satisfying), firenza pizza (goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, carmelized mushrooms and onions, red pepper flakes, worth coming here for this alone!) and something new we haven't tried.  The grilled pear salad, marguerita pizza, white pizza, stuffed banana pepper, fried artichokes, rigatoni bolognese, meatballs, and sangria are all very good.  Desserts are also tasty, the chocolate cake and creme brulee sampler were perfect for sharing. I have been dissapointed by non-Italian type foods though, the dim sum was poor at best.    Decor and ambiance are very nice and contemporary; they open up the bar area in warm weather so you can sit outside or inside where it is cool but still feel as if you're outdoors.  I find the hostess service adequate and polite and waiters and waitresses are very helpful.  Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. I brought a friend promising that this place was good, only to be completely ignored by the wait staff. Will most likely never go back- I don't find myself ever wanting to pay $8 for a Caesar salad again."}
{"text":"I thought this place was so so.  I went this past Wednesday. I was greeted and led to a nice place by the window.   The service was better than okay - although I do think my server spent quite a bit of time chatting with a favorite customer.  I think that's great, but pay attention to your other customers especially when there is hardly anyone in the resturant. I just didn't think the food was good.  I ordered an iceberg lettuce salad - as it was so hot outside I thought a nice crisp salad would be great.  Well, it was not that cold and it was almost wilted.  The dressing was abundant - unpleasantly so - with garlic.  I had envisioned chopped candied pecans - they were sort of placed on the plate to the side along with a cold strip of bacon.  Not too much effort went into this salad.   I also wanted the weekly selection of ravioli - but they were out of it - even though it didn't seem as though they had a rush at dinner (this was about 7 pm).  I had some meatball dish with a five minute poached egg on it which was again, okay.  The crostini was the best part of the meal.  The hostess was very nice."}
{"text":"One star for outdoor seating (we had a dog with us) and a nice waitress.  Wine was so-so but overpriced.  Food menu looked good but the calamari was nothing special and the veggie spring rolls were downright terrible.  I agree with everyone else, don't go here.  There are other good tapas joints in this city, and well worth the fact that they are all overpriced for this market."}
{"text":"Aaron C's comments are spot on, based on my experience.  We came here with a huge party for my wife's birthday a year or so ago.  The service and ambiance are both above average, but the food is entirely unremarkable.  By broadening their style of tapas to include more variants of Mediterranean cuisine, they compromised thematic and flavor continuity.  Moreover, execution and presentation were sub-par.  A few dishes felt incomplete and failed utterly, some were reasonably good, though unimpressive, and most were on the \"meh\" side of mediocre.  It was clear that they weren't overly concerned with the quality of their ingredients, which leads me to believe the inflated prices are merely paying for atmosphere.  All in all a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Worst tapas for the price. Ever. I think we paid $8 for two of the tiniest dumplings with barely any filling. We reasoned that the olives, for $5, were the only fairly priced dish. And it's not that we're against high priced food, not at all, it's just what you're getting for that price... which is the worst pita bread that you could get at a restaurant that claims to be serving freshly prepared food (it was likely purchased from the Southside Giant Eagle).  What hurts even more: the cocktail menu. We were shocked and offended to find a martini (a proper gin and vermouth martini) called a \"stuffed up\" - it's bad enough the add martini to drink names that have no right being called a martini, but to call a martini anything other than a martini is outrageous. They mutilated the classics like mojitos and tom collins and made them $10. The $10 tomato juice and tomato vodka that I got was delicious, but I felt that the price gouging on both food and drinks was highly... aghhh! Just don't go.  I was also kind of taken aback that the waitress asked the standard \"have you been here before\" spiel that you'll usually get a national chain. YES we know what tapas are, stop pretending like you invented some kind of new cuisine that needs to be explained to us.  Nice atmosphere and nice people, but go somewhere else. Like Ibiza."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible. Weak service. A disgrace to the South Side Works."}
{"text":"Don't know if we'd go out of our way for this again, but our experience wasn't as awful as many others here.  We had greens & beans (very good), chorizo  & potatoes (good), tapenade (too salty), mussels (good), mushroom risotto (average - also very salty) and the sangria.  The major issue we had was the live music, which was just out of place (a duo doing best of the 70s/80s) for dinnertime.  We did get to talk to Chris the chef - it was only his second or third week there when we went.  Nice guy, seems pretty talented and we've noticed the menu has expanded since our visit."}
{"text":"I love tapas, but the trend can be truly hit-or-miss - \"small plates\" doesn't have to mean \"miniscule portions and inflated prices\". Thankfully, Tusca avoids this predicament - granted, it's costly, but I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. I went with a friend and the two of us split four plates -- stuffed roasted pepper with basil, mozzarella, and prosciutto; hummus and pita, fried artichokes, and margherita pizza. The fried artichokes were by far the highlight of the meal, with the stuffed roasted pepper a close second. Our waitress was great, and even though we had to wait an hour and ten minutes for a table late on a Saturday night, the food was served almost immediately. It's a little too expensive to be a regular mainstay, but I'd definitely go back next time I want to splurge."}
{"text":"Relatively new restaurant around the South Side area in Pittsburgh. This is probably not the best tapas bar in Pittsburgh, but it is a good bang for your buck. My friend and I had 4 tapas, two drinks and with tips the bill came out to $50. The selection is pretty good and the food is very tasty. They have outdoor seating too, which is perfect for the nice weather we have now. If you're reading this review when the weather is bad, sorry.   On to the food. Recommended: Stuffed Grape Leaves and Shrimp Bruschetta.  If you want to spend (a lot) more money, I would suggest Ibiza, of the Mallorca fame."}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment.  My friend and I flew to Pittsburgh celebrate our friend's birthday with her, and we wanted to take her to a nice dinner. We all love tapas, and were sent here on a recomendation. The food was dry and lacked flavor of any kind.  Simply, the worst tapas I have ever had.  And I eat tapas a lot.  It was awful - the best thing we ordered was the greens and beans.  Is that even Spanish? That's sad when that is the best thing on the menu. The decor was nice, but the wines were very minimal.  They have only one supplier for wine, so its only one brand. Very weird. Even worse, my friend in Pittsburgh, was dissapointed.  That's sucks when its your birthday.  We felt horrible about dinner. But, we made it up by going out and drinking our dinner, instead."}
{"text":"\"The food here is lousy!  And such small portions!\"  Who knew that a quote from classic comedy would so perfectly sum up what has to be one of the most pretentious, expensive, and yet worst restaurants in the South Side.  I have been to this place twice and can safely say that I have had enough.  The shrimp bruschetta gets a special shout out for being absolutely disgusting.  What must have been recently thawed peas and shrimp on top of wet bread.  That being said, the waitstaff was pleasant and it is well decorated, but the atmosphere and clientele pretty much personify douchery.  I'm convinced that it is only frequented by the people that will buy into anything even remotely having the word Tuscan in it.    With all the excellent upscale restaurants in Pittsburgh, it's sad that this place always seems to have a crowd."}
{"text":"Just Okay.  The place itself is nice inside.  The staff were not all that interested in helping us.  The prices were in line with what we expected and the food was fine.  What hurts Tusca is that other, better Tapas places are nearby.  Also the clientele at Tusca seemed to be mainly female late 30's to 40's who were there to hunt for younger upwardly mobile young men.  Maybe this was just the few times I was there."}
{"text":"Hello Tusca!  I was back again to visit my favorite tapas place in Pittsburgh.  Once again, you didn't fail to make me smile.  Ooooo, the blueberry martini, ooooo, the pear martini.....just for starters.  No, my review isn't glowing because of the alcohol...I only had one and my dining companion had the other.  Where to begin with the tempting choices before me?  Okay, let's start with the hummus...yum!  And because I can't eat wheat, you thoughtfully brought me wonderful veggies to dip luxuriously in the velvety dip.  Next up to the table, the grilled veggie salad with hazelnut encrusted, creamy, delicate goat cheese and a marvelous dressing surrounded by grilled zucchini, red peppers, baby artichoke quarters, grilled grape tomatoes...mmmm-mmmm.  Nice piquant accents against smooth and creamy all piled on top of beautifully fresh greens.  And, oh the grilled shrimp with a citrusy glaze.  Sweet, succulent, with a little bitter citrus to balance the sweetness.  Perfect.  My favorite of the afternoon, the best of the best, was the chicken breast stuffed with cheeses and artichokes and sundried tomatoes, wrapped in prosciutto so thin that when grilled it crisply became as one with the chicken.  Heaven.  What a lovely way to spend an afternoon, just grazing and lazing and enjoying good company over great food!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior design, sleek, contemporary.  However, something is missing, not sure what it is.  Service was excellent.  The tapas were okay.  They seem to use a creamy garlic EVOO sauce on everything.  Shrimp Bruschetta.  Shrimp scampi pizza.  Their recipes are clearly their own concoction.  I mean who makes bruschetta with green peas?  And grape tomatoes are no substitute for the real tomato.  It's nothing that I would want to imitate.  It's probably just best to sit on the patio and drink a beer."}
{"text":"I preface this with the disclaimer that I am a starving college student, so I am the exact opposite of picky. My bar of expectations is set pretty low. Ramen, ketchup soup, you name it. But tonight, Tusca deserved a one-star review.  Went in for the first time with my boyfriend, and we decided to order two entrees - the lobster pasta and the salmon. They were $20 each. Right now, I want you to cup one hand into a fist: that is the size of the portion we were given for both entrees. The lobster pasta was so full of oil it was impossible to even taste the actual lobster. If we had gotten two fistfuls of amazing cuisine, that'd be one thing, but... really? I've been to restaurants with portions that size before... as appetizers or tapas. Not for the entrees, and not for that price.  We were still starving (and we really aren't big eaters) so we decided to order a pizza. THAT was where we actually got a normal person sized portion - it was decently good.  Additionally, they had no menus for us for the first fifteen minutes, and then forgot to bring us napkins and silverware. We had to ask twice. Really awkward."}
{"text":"I am very much over \"Tusca\".  I first visited here over a year ago and have been here aboout a dozen times since and I've never had  a good experience.  The only reason I go here is because it is convenient and they have outdoor seating. Yesterday's experience was the impetus to finally document and update my distaste for this place.  We get there about 130 PM prior to going to seeing the new mike judge movie. We enter and head towards the bar.  It is very muggy inside of this place, how they manage that I just don't know.  It's a relatively mild humidity day outside and feels like a costa rican airport inside.  There also is an off putting smell to the place that is a cross between some kind of industrial cleaner and something else I can't quite place..maybe the smell of broken dreams...  The bartender is so obviously uninterested and apathetic that you can feel the contempt he obviously has for the customers and the disappointment in where he finds himself.  I ask for a guinness and they don't have one nor do they suggest a suitable alternative.  Annie gets a pretty awful vodka/tonic and I settle on a shiraz,,,maybe the worst glass of wine I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was just gross.  Annie orders a pizza, which truthfully was edible.  I mean it was cheese, marinara and soggy crust.  I had the hot tapas steak and fries,,,which took close to an hour to receive with no apology.  The steak was okay, the fries were edible, but again I was so turned off by the atmosphere that even if the food was really good, which it wasn't I wouldn't be back."}
