{"text":"Very good food!  (I've eaten almost everything here seeing as I live within walking distance)The cold sandwiches have A LOT of meat on them, almost to much.  I usually have to take so much off that I could make another sandwich.  If you are on a diet or want something lighter get the steak salad.  It may sound weird if you read it off the menu but it's Delish!  Oh, and of course, the Philly cheese steaks are pretty unique and gooooood :)"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and the old bay beer battered fries are killer.  Best cheesesteak I've had outside of Philly.  Well worth the stop.  If you are in the area, definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Just picked up 7 cheese steaks on a lunch run for a group of us. Everyone was very happy with there sandwich and we will be going back again."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase.  Without a doubt this is the best place to get a philly-style cheesesteak in Cleveland.    The owners are philly transplants, and that is evident as soon as you walk in, as the place is festooned with philadelphia memorabilia.  It's located in a strip mall in Twinsburg.  A bit out of the way for some, but definitely worth it.  If you've been to any of numerous cheesesteak places in Philly (D'alessandro's is my favorite) the inside is going to seem familiar to you.  Nothing fancy, not sterile-clean, just a place to sit and enjoy an excellent cheesesteak.  They have a variety of cheesesteaks and you can go with white american, cheese whiz or provolone.  If your cheesesteak tastes have been limited to Mr. Hero (good in it's own right, but not a philly cheese steak) do yourself a favor and get one with cheese whiz and grilled onions.  You'll thank and hate yourself at the same time. Let's face it, this isn't exactly health food fare.  But sometimes that's okay, so make sure you get a side order of fries with the Bay seasoning also.  They have other items on the menu, some hoagies, hot dogs and salads.  I swear if you come here and get a salad...  Seriously. Sit down, really sit and think. What made you arrive at this decision. What is going on with your life that brought you to the best cheese steak place in cleveland and then decide that the salad is what you should be ordering?   Well, whatever it is, change it bucko!  No one, Well most... Okay, Some people aren't so horrible that they don't deserve a cheese steak.  A quick word about the prices. It's more expensive than you might think.  A cheese steak, fries, and drink will be about $10-$15 depending on what exactly you order.  But again, it's worth it.  Go. Eat. Experience the joy of cheese steak.  Or get a salad, I won't judge. (Yes I will, you loser)"}
{"text":"Ok, WOW!  I had a 7 inch cheesesteak with provolone and onions and it was delicious! the meat was so tender and the buns are awesome . . . It is large and filling but just right for me.  I ordered my husband a cheesesteak with provolone, onions, and mushrooms . . . We both agreed the best we have ever had . . . It was better than the ones we actually have had in Philly!  Try it - you'll love it. ."}
{"text":"This place is pretty simple.  If you want a sub, come here. If you don't want a sub, go somewhere else. They only make subs but they are the best subs I've ever had. Buffalo chicken is highly recommended. They use fresh chicken. It's the real deal."}
{"text":"Too long if a wait. Especially at lunch time Cook tasted tuna to make sure it was \"fresh\"?  Then put it back.  Makes me wonder Could be a little friendlier when placing order but I guess not to important Steak sandwich good and fresh off griddle"}
{"text":"Great cheese steak sandwich! Lots of cheese and steak, the hot peppers are perfect on it. Fast and friendly service. No complaints here. Love their food!"}
{"text":"This place is our guilty pleasure.  Sensational, authentic Philly ribeye cheesesteaks. Order it \"whiz-wit\"!"}
{"text":"I moved to Ohio from Philly a few years back and have been searching for a good hoagie or steak for a while now. I saw that this place used dietz and Watson meats and amoroso rolls so i had to give it a try. I walked in and as a test i ordered a wiz wit and they actually knew what I meant. The steak was pretty good, no pat's or genos's but it was the best I've had outside Philly. My buddy ordered a chicken parm sub which was also very good. I then ordered \"the original\" hoagie to take home which was exactly what I would expect from any place back home. I currently live 40 min away and will gladly drive out here when I am ever craving a taste of home."}
{"text":"I have been there several times, while the cheese steaks are good, the wait time is a bit long. Went there today, they said it would be about 15 minutes for the 1 cheesesteak, after 30 minutes, I asked how much longer and I got a response of we are working on it. After asking what that means, the woman at the counter could not give me an answer. She did immediately ask if I wanted a refund, which I took.  By how quickly she gave it out, seems like an on going problem of a poorly run restaurant, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I think the positive reviews here must be from the owner's friends or people going to a different place. I waited 33 minutes from the time I walked in until I left with my to-go order. The seating area was about 1/2 full with patrons also waiting.  I ordered a hot Italian and onion rings. The Italian is supposed to be a little messy, but that mess is also what's adding flavor...usually. Their sandwich was overly greasy and bland. Not a good combination. The rings were overcooked in oil that was really past its time to be changed.  Due to the Help Wanted sign, old oil and slow service is to be expected. Skip this place."}
{"text":"While this isn't the most extravagant place, it's the quality of food that counts.  This place brings Philadelphia to Ohio, hands down.  My girlfriend and I tried it out last Friday for dinner, and it was just awesome.  We split a steak philly with white american and all peppers and onions, along with fries seasoned with old bay and cheese dipping sauce.  Everything was top notch.  So top notch that when we wanted to grab lunch the next day, guess where we went?  Damn straight lol...but this time, we each got our own!  Soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food and nice relaxed atmosphere. I honestly love this place now, though its a bit pricey you get a good amount of food for your money."}
{"text":"I live in Twinsburg and have drove past this place so many times. Last weekend I finally stopped in. I am so mad at myself for not trying it sooner! This place has the best, most authentic philly cheesesteak I've had in Ohio! Everything is made to order, and the quality is just great. The fries with old bay and cheese are amazing too!  I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Amazing...Cheesesteak was great and the line moved fast and the food came out just as fast!!!"}
{"text":"Great food love the old bay French frys!"}
{"text":"Going downhill fast. I predict they will go out of business. Rude workers, inconsistent hours. Place was a ghost town when we were there."}
{"text":"If you are a Philly-area native living in NE Ohio, this is as close as you'll get to a taste of home. You know it's all about the bread and here they have Amoroso's rolls! Ok, so they may have been frozen along the way, I'm not sure, but that really doesn't matter. I stopped in for a cheese steak for lunch and took a hoagie for dinner. One of the best days I've had since living here.  Do it. You will be smiling."}
{"text":"Came during the lunch rush on a weekday.  Service was friendly, but slow.  The space is clean and well stocked (napkins, forks, condiments on all the tables).  We tried the cheesesteak, the Italian hoagie, the beer-battered fries with Bay seasoning, regular plain fries, and sweet potato tots.  My husband says the cheesesteak is as good as he's ever had.  I thought the tots were pretty good.  My sandwich was fine - big but difficult to eat (that photo is not of a deconstructed sandwich.  That's actually how they give it to you).  The fries were unremarkable.  After the coupon from their website, our meal was about $25, which is a bit much for sandwiches and fries.  The kids meal is $4.25 for chicken fingers, fries, and a drink, but they don't have juice or milk, just the regular fountain drinks or cans/bottles of pop.  Not a huge issue, but definitely a missed opportunity to be more kid friendly.  For us it was enough reason to not order a kids meal and just share our food with the kid instead.  Worth a try, but I probably won't be making the 10 minute drive to come back.  But I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches in general, so take that as you will."}
{"text":"BEST philly cheese steaks in ohio!!!!! period. I ALWAYS double up on my mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and provolone because they are waaaaaaaay to GENEROUS with the meat"}
{"text":"From my 6 year old:  This is the best cheesesteak place in the world!  Tried the American and provolone and preferred the American. The fresh cut fries were excellent with malt vinegar."}
{"text":"It's good but not impressive. Too expensive. Over $13 for a small sandwich, fries, and a drink? C'mon man!"}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint. There is a shortage of great sub shops in Cleveland, especially one that specializes in Phillies. My family and I went her for dinner and ordered chicken teriyaki subs and an original cheesesteak. Both were great and the accompanying fries as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"All the people ranting this is as good as a cheese steak from Philly are either delusional or have never been to Philly.  The cheese steaks are decent but they aren't Philly quality for one simple reason...The roll.  Their rolls are nowhere near as good or crusty as a true Philly cheese steak.  So stop having family members review you, get better rolls and then we can talk.  All in all, the food is acceptable, and I will continue to eat here, but there is no way this place is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came to Original Steak and Hoagie based on Yelp reviews and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Ultimate with beer battered Bay fries and it was tremendous. I have never been to Philadelphia but now I don't need to."}
{"text":"Sometimes I flirt with getting back into the service industry. And I think if I did throw my hat back into the ring, I would have to find something close to my heart, a product I believe in, and so- I would apply to Original Steaks and Hoagies first, and here's why-  My mother (mudda) is a Jersey girl. Merchantville to be exact. And no less than once a year, sometimes three times, my lady and I venture out to the East in the spirit of ol' Lucille. We summer in Ocean City (New Jersey, not Maryland), we stop in Philly. We lunch at Reading. We do all this.   Now, even saying how snobbish we can be with cheesesteaks- the best cheesesteak on the O.C. island is closed. Like, even New Jersey cheesesteaks are starting to fail to impress us...   Original Steaks and Hoagies is the best cheesesteaks you can get in Ohio. As a Jersey boy with Cleveland roots and pride- I understand it hurts my heart to take a title away from Mr. Hero, but I gotsta be honest- if you don't like an OSH cheesesteak, my friend- YOU DON'T LIKE cheesesteaks. Simple as that.   Four stars because I've only had it once, and I'll be back, and if it's as good as the first time- brudda, you gettin' five. How nice it is to have this place in my backyard and not having to deal with finding parking on Passyunk (not a curse word, even though, I know, it kinda looks weird) Avenue."}
{"text":"Our neighbors raved over this place and took us here one night.  We each had the Philly cheese steak with onions and hot peppers and cheese whiz.  I think the next time I'll try provolone, but it was delish.  Half of the large sandwich is PLENTY.  Also, the fries come in a little bucket and are SUPER tasty!  They also have peanut butter Tasty Kakes!  The only thing I would change would be to have a drink fountain - they only have bottles and cans."}
{"text":"First time as we live about an hour away but were in Twinsburg to golf and a buddy mentioned to me to try this place.  Price point was as expected $8.50 for a large cheesesteak.  It was fantastic, so tender and chopped small made it just melt!  Sidenote they had birch beer on the fountain which i havent had in years so that was a score!  We also ordered the beer battered fries that the worker reccomended they were pretty amazing!  Ive only really had Penn Station and some other cheesesteaks here and there but it blew them away!  Kind of in a slower plaza otherwise I think theyd be lining them out the door!  Give them a shot if youre in the area!"}
{"text":"Slow order taking and making of sandwich Ingredients not fresh, old cheese, mixed in with the meats on a tray. I ordered tuna because of lent. Meat pieces all over the cheese and both on the same slicer.   Not organized and under staffed"}
{"text":"Been to Philly and I got to say this place id pretty close, and i love the hot peppers and mushroom in my philly cheassteak"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent. Worth the trip if out of area. If in area, you will weigh 300 lbs cuz it's addicting."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak.  New fresh cut fries are such an improvement. Check these guys out!"}
{"text":"Can't complain about the cheese steak... Absolutely delicious. Whoever wrote up the menu did a nice job of making variances of cheesesteaks which doesn't seem very easy. However, the gentleman who served me was very rude and put a damper on the sandwich. Restaurant could also benefit from some upgrades, considering their fountain drink machine barely worked."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've had this place bookmarked forever and finally went to try it  I went with my girlfriend which we both got 10\" philly cheesteaks with onions, on mine I had lettuce and white american and she had whiz on hers, we also got an order of bay Fry's.  My sandwich was beyond amazing the meat was so thin but retained so much flavor, the bread was crisp enough to not get soggy which was perfect.  My girlfriend also said this was the best philly she's had outside of philly (she's a philly native) she said it was no genos or pats but even in philly who is a genos or pats.  Also there whiz had flavor too it and the bay Fry's are a must they were really good perfect crunch and salty flavor with a nice potatoe inside.   All in all this is my new go to spot for a cheesteak, prices are solid the food is much better then I could even describe, this place is bomb"}
{"text":"Nice find for Twinsburg! Got the original and some seasoned fries. Very tasty. Nice size sandwich with healthy amount of beef. Nice staff. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked to try. Finally did today. It was pretty good. The inside could look a little better and the sign on the outside is rather small but I ended with getting a 7 in chicken philly and some fries. The fries were okay. I could've had the sandwich without them and the chicken philly was pretty good. I would go again if I was in the area but if not in the area prob not. The people were kinda friendly and it's all subs."}
{"text":"What can I say....a cheesesteak wit whizzzz...hard to find in Northeast Ohio, but here we have one!  Best cheesesteak I've had outside of Philadelphia! And the battered bay fries are just as delish!  If you love cheesesteaks then this place is a must!!!  Mine had mushrooms, provolone, sweet peppers and of course wit whiz!  Just fantastic!"}
{"text":"expensive but worth it.  My last visit the cheese was a little on the lite side, I will make sure I mention to put more cheese on the philly..."}
{"text":"New ownership and you can tell they know nothing about Philly food. The cheesesteaks were not prepared in true Philly fashion. I ordered a pepper steak wit  provolone. All I got was minimal steak provolone didn't see any Peppers or onions. Their large size is half the size of a true Philly cheese steak. I also ordered a hoagie again the hoagie was not prepared anywhere close how it's done in Philly. The lettuce was on the bottom of the bun with the meats on top of the lettuce and again the portion half the size of a true large Hoagie in Philly. If you want to bring Philly to the land as your T-shirt says perhaps you should go back and study Philly food before you advertise you make legit Philly steaks and Hoagies. Just cuz you use those titles doesn't make them anywhere close to being those things."}
{"text":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!  If you want a true Philly Steak Sandwich THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. Excellent customer service, very friendly and a clean facility."}
{"text":"The price is a lil high at first glance but after completing a meal here you will have no regrets."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak, Cheesesteak, Cheesecake, we all scream Cheesesteak! Yum! This restaurant is easy to find and plenty of parking outside. The sign on the building is small but noticeable from the street. Ordered at the counter and they brought it out to our table. I ordered a small original cheesesteak and added american cheese. Order a combo and get a fountain drink, fries or tots on the side. The cheesesteak was finely chopped along with peppers, onions and mushrooms. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries were fresh cut and nicely salted. I am so grateful for yelp and helping me find this gem. I love a great local spot when traveling and yelp helps me get there. When in the area and you love a good cheesesteak, this is a must. Get it philly style and ask for cheese wiz."}
{"text":"Great spot. Had a late lunch with the family while in Cleveland. Josh (an owner) polite, friendly and helpful from start through finish. He waited on us at the counter, made our food and made us feel at home. We had various kinds of cheesesteak. The meat was tender and juicy. The buns were fresh and delicious. The handcut fries would make a great addition to any meal. Food, service and prices all on point. Stop by and give it a try. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Don't order for delivery!! Placed an order and was told it would be there in an hour. No food at an hour and a half so called. Was told it was on its way. No food at 2 hours. Called and was told our order got lost because of a rush. If I wanted to place my order again, they would have it to us in an hour. I told them we had already waited long enough. No sandwich is that good!! No apology or future discounts offered! Poor management and customer service!!"}
{"text":"simply put....not good. if this is what a Philly is supposed to taste like then color me unimpressed"}
{"text":"The owner met me at the door and knew my name...wow!  Best Cheesesteak ever. I'm from out of town and need to have one whenever I'm in town  10/10/16....In town again and had to get an Original Cheese Steak...yum"}
{"text":"This place is a gem the best steaks around everything is philly  the meat is 100 percent is real beef and they chopped it by hand   If i lived a hour away i would make the trip. The owner is great thank you for coming here to ohio.  Also the customer  service is A plus they went out of there way to delivery to my house  the best subs"}
{"text":"Awesome cheesteaks! Authentic Philly sammiches right here in OhioQ"}
{"text":"I have driven past this plaza a million times but after checking out the Yelp reviews on this sandwich spot I decided to finally give it a try. I got a philly w/ whiz, mushrooms, sweet peppers and onions. I have never had an \"authentic\" philly cheesesteak so i honestly didn't know what to expect. I only opted to get the whiz to try to get a traditional taste experience. Wow boy was I happy I did! These sandwich was absolutely delicious. The meat is very tender and they pile it on! The bread is soft and pillowy. The cheese has a nice flavor to it as well. The sandwich itself was HUGE and easily enough to share especially if you get fries. I have been back a few times now am as equally as impressed as I was on my first go round. I would like to try the italian hoagie, because I love a good italian but so far I have been too stuck on the cheesesteaks to get anything else. I don't think there is any where else in the city where you can find a cheesesteak as good."}
{"text":"This is update to a previous review, and big news. New owners have reopened and  they're giving the place an updated makeover. The place looks a little unfinished now, but the bones look good and I'm sure it will look great when done. Note to owners: keep a lot of the Philly theme that was there to start (e.g. the origin of the term hoagie, that's priceless whether it's true or not, the old Philly photos, Sports references, then blend with CLE). The restaurant is small and kind of chilly on a cold day in the winter, but the steak was great. I got the cheesesteak with pizza sauce on the side (another note to management.. heat up some sauce for sides, don't serve cold, c'mon man). They're still getting the bread from South Jersey, and it's the bomb."}
{"text":"Delicious! Atmosphere could use bit of sprucing up but I felt they had the food ready in a decent time, fresh, hot, and amazing. Their special fries are amazing too!"}
{"text":"First I'd like to say I have been eating here for years. Now open even later and on Sunday's it's one of my favorite sandwiches in the area!! Staff is amazing and the service is quick! If you either from town or just passing through I would take the time to stop here!"}
{"text":"Food was great and amazing! Very friendly people! Soda machine was out of O2 and no ice maybe it was an off day. Service could have been a tad better seemed like they were busy but there was no one else in the dining room had troubles with delivery orders. Over all amazing food and friendly people! Hoping next visit will be more smooth."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time about a month ago. The cheesesteaks were amazing! So great that we couldn't stop thinking about them and had to go back asap!! I got the small steak with white American cheese and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's a true Philly sandwich, but they are delicious here. I've had the white american and Whiz versions, but prefer the white. The meat is cut to the size of baby eyelashes and is moist, tasty and tender. Looks like they custom order/bake their rolls and they're perfect for holding all that gooey beef goodness. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this place rocks."}
{"text":"So when I was young, we would go to my grandmother's house to do chores,  and while we were working grandma would go up to Mayfield Imports and Presti's bakery and then come back and make us fresh sandwiches for lunch.  Since then, I have tried to replicate that taste.  I do alright,  but it is nice to know there is a place nearby that will hit the spot.  Their Italian hoagie brings back memories.   Fresh crusty bread, thin sliced meats and cheeses,  the oil and oregano.  The spicy capicola contrasts nicely with the sweet marinated peppers.  Yeah, this is a real sandwich!  I also had the ultimate philly.  I've never been to Philadelphia so I can't say if this is authentic Philadelphia style, but it tastes great so I don't care.  (Ok, so one person who grew up there told me that it is authentic philly style philly.  So there. It's real!)  Oh, and for your beverage,  get the Birch beer.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Still a fan however, they need to pay more attention to phone orders. The past two orders we placed have contained onions when we asked numerous times for just \"american cheese no onions\". Have never had a problem with this order in the past. Wasted money on 4 cheesesteaks due to the onions."}
{"text":"Great combination of Pats and Geno's in South Phila.  Wiz or provolone, you pick your style.  Had both the Hoagie and Cheesesteak.  Fabulous. Could use a little better seating."}
{"text":"apparently someone recently bought The Original Steak and Hoagies. and with the sale went all the charm. the interior is stark. the menu board feels corporate. gone are the authentic paper wrapping and brown to go bags. they've been replaced with a foil wrapper and walmart style grocery bags. the sandwich was ok at best and the fries were soggy. such a shame. when billy f. opened the joint it was the real deal. now it's just another sub shop."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure exactly what had happened but I see that it is under new management. I ordered our usual which is two of the original Italians with provolone cheese. What I got was nothing like what I've been getting for the last several years. Very little meat, a bunch of lettuce, and no provolone which I specifically asked for and they actually printed \"Add provelone\" on the receipt for both. I'm sad to say that I probably won't be back to a place which has been a standby for several years."}
{"text":"One of my wife's favorite spots. Above average sandwich. Get the cole slaw-home made! Has a bite-very good. Owner makes you feel welcome. Asset to Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Gots some coupons on the site that are outdated but they still honor and thats a bonus!!! So portions....WOW! I ordered a bunch of stuff thinking portions were going to be small, yeah umm no...Ginormous sammiches monstrous servings of ff and if you get a sammy, you can get a big cup of chili for $1.50!!! The staff is pleasant and VERY courteous and keep everything very clean.  So Sure...I'll say yum! pretty freaken tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"As close as you're going to get to a real Philly Cheese Steak in Ohio.  To top it all off, the employees/managers/owners are incredibly nice people.  Try the Old Bay fries with your cheese steak/hoagie.  Just a great, great spot."}
{"text":"Yes, just yes!!! Great cheesesteak sandwiches - packed with meat in a delicious soft bun. Pair it with some beer battered fries and you can't go wrong!! Reasonable prices for the amount of food you get!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place-everything is made to order-LOTS of options on the menu- really nice family"}
{"text":"I would give them a negative amount of stars if I could. This place is terribly ran. They definitely should not offer delivery. They can't keep up and when you call about your order I can assure you that they will not care. There's so many other places so close to this one where you'll get a great meal with much better service. Make the better decision and avoid this one."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since the new owners took over. The food is different now and I can't quite put my finger on what is different. I don't know if it is the quality of the beef, a lack of seasoning, or what. The bread looks the same but there is something off about it too. Maybe the old owners did a butter toasting, not sure. Overall, it just isn't as good and I really don't have any interest in returning. One thing that has bothered me even with the previous owners is it just wouldn't cost that much to improve the seating. Some more comfortable chairs would be nice."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the week. Only a few people in here. Seems that most of their business is delivery. I got a cheesesteak with whiz. It was very delicious. I have never been to Philly but others have told me this place is better. Fries were average. I will get something different like onion rings next time. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The BEST CHEESESTEAKS around!!  If ordering lunch I highly recommend phoning your order in.  The 10\" cheesesteak with provolone on the fresh Amorosia roll is reasonably priced for the serving (I typically eat 1/2)."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steaks sandwiches so nice I had it twice, 2 days in a row actually. chopped prime rib, none of that shaker valley or restaurant depot steak. I would definitely pick this place over Penn Station. ( not that Penn Station is a slouch, but there can only be one top dog)"}
{"text":"Still killing it here at the Amorosa roll paradise. No cheese with everything is the way I like it. Happy I still work in the area. Closer now. I think they changed owners? Nothing else has changed. Should be 4 of these places in Greater Cleveland. Get on it!"}
{"text":"This might be hands down the best place to eat in Twinsburg!  I always get the buffalo chicken and their house fries and it never fails to impress. Their bread is so perfectly soft and the meat is so finely shredded that a new born baby could eat it.  House fries are awesome can't really describe them.   Its a little chilly in there so don't expect to be comfortable and warm at the same time during the winter. I would never say that is a deal breaker about going to this place.  That is about the only issue I have with this place."}
{"text":"Went there twice and both times were so disappointing. Meat was over cooked and little or no cheese on it. Got some onion rings and they were over cooked ( border line burnt). I would never recommend this place or be back. Now on my do not eat list. Can't see what the hipe is. Had better cheese steak,s"}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and happy to find a great cheesesteak! Good, friendly service. Had cheesesteak with bells, onions, and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Best place to get a philly in the Cleveland area, hands down. This place was awesome.. We tried the original philly, chicken philly, beer battered bay fries and the deep fried pretzels. Everything was absolutely delicious. Customer service was top notch too, a huge plus. Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  I lived in Philadelphia for three years and when I moved back to Ohio, I missed eating the Philly cheese steaks.  I heard about this place and made a visit. The hoagies and cheese steaks are just like the ones in Philly.   In my past visits I have had the cheese steak with onions and cheez whiz, pizza steak, The Original hoagie, Italian hoagie and battered fries with old bay.  It's a little $$ but it's worth it.  All of it delicious and authentic Philly."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER IN STORE. CALL AHEAD. 50 minute wait standing in their not as clean as it could be restaurant. Need fresh paint on walls. Steak sandwich was big, nice melding of tastes. The onions and peppers were pulverized like the steak. Reminds me of nursing home food. Pre-chewed. Chewy bun good, not great. May have been Orlando brand. Not special. People love this place. I think it is okay but not astounding or original. Reply of employee re making me wait while others behind me got food and left: sorry, we get busy on Fridays. Wrong answer. How about: we let you down, here is your money back or a voucher to try us again. Not going back, not recommending."}
{"text":"Okay, grabbed an original wit whiz, onions and hot peppers. Sandwich was great, each component played off the other well. The bay fries were great as well. Came in at 1:00 and left at 1:45. 25 minutes before I got my food. The wait was worth it but even though it was steady it wasn't overly busy. For someone out of town looking  to get a quick bite I was definitely not pleased with that aspect, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome and it's definitely gone down hill, both in food quality and cleanliness. Boo."}
{"text":"There is no need to order \"double meat\" when you go here, because their sandwiches are already overflowing with meat.  In fact, I had to ask for a plastic fork to eat all the meat that had just fallen off my sandwich each time I went to take a bite.  First time here.,..couldn't decide between the cheesesteak and the buffalo chicken, so I got one of each.  I got a cheesesteak w/ whiz and mushrooms, and a buffalo chicken w/ provolone.  Both were piping hot, and FILLED with delicious meat and cheese.  The only complaint I have is that the buffalo chicken could have used a bit more buffalo sauce (and maybe some ranch), but other than that these two were great.  Also ordered the cheese fries.  The cheese on top is melted whiz.  Eat them quickly, because the cheese makes them extra-filling.  Also...the staff here is out-freakin'-standing.  Like I said, this was my first time here, and the staff made me feel right at home, like I was a regular there.  The guy who makes the food...didn't catch his name, but I am assuming he's also the owner...even came out to check on everyone who was having lunch there personally.  Great place all-around.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but based on the glowing yelp reviews I was pretty disappointed! I got the Ultimate Philly with beer battered bay fries and cheese on the side. (Note: I had never eaten cheez whiz before but I now know that it is not for me).   The fries were really good, I ate them with some malt vinegar and they were definitely the best part. The sandwich itself wasn't filled very full, and the salami and onions mixed in with the beef didn't add much flavor. I'm saving half of everything for lunch tomorrow, wish I could say I was looking forward to it. Even though I'll get two average sized meals out if it, $14 is pretty steep for what I got.  TLDR: try the fries but don't break the bank by getting the Ultimate Philly..it's the most expensive and I think I would have been equally happy with the standard Philly."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times and it is amazing.  This as good as the cheesesteaks you get in Philly.  I tried the chicken version and the regular with cheese whiz and both were fantastic.  The interior is nice and they have a nice LCD to watch while you eat and also the paper and magazines to read as well. As someone who is in sales and on the road a lot by himself this is nice. It not seem like a big deal but the owners go above and beyond to make the customer happy.  That combined with the amazing sandwiches make this one of my favorite places to eat in greater cleveland."}
{"text":"I will drive hours to go there..... I love it....Thank you all. The food was great I love Halley jo. Salad..I love the name"}
{"text":"Perfection.  Best taste of Philly west of Philadelphia. Try the Original once and you'll find yourself coming back again and again.  Kid friendly and out of town guest approved.   Hoagies as good as Lee's Hoagie House.  Cheese steak's better than Pat's King of Steaks.  (And I've eaten at both in the past year.).  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Buffalo, New York. One of my favorite foods is the steak and cheese sub. Finally a place in Cleveland that can replicate the steak and cheese of Western New York. Great little place in Twinsburg. A must for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I was informed of the existence of this establishment sometime around 2006. When I joined yelp in 2009, I bookmarked it. Well, it's 2018, and I finally made it to Original Steaks and Hoagies. I'm wishing that I hadn't waited this long, but it's the first time I've been near it in Twinsburg.  I ordered the Original with everything on it with a side of fries. Damn, it was a great sandwich. Turns out they use real rib-eye steak, fresh peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese. It was very tasty and the steamed, yet crunchy bread was on point. Wow! The only thing I didn't love was the level of heat in the peppers. I mean, they were certainly tasty, but the heat didn't add any value for me. I think I'll pass on the peppers next time and that will make my perfect Philly cheese steak. I'm so glad we visited.  My daughter was starving after her volleyball tournament and she ordered the chicken teriyaki sub. She said \"That was the best thing I've ever eaten!\"  I tasted one of my son's chicken tenders. Those were scratch made, moist, and absolutely delicious. The fresh cut fries were great and they have malt vinegar at each table just like Arthur Treachers. The worker threw in a free batch of deep fried mac n cheese and they were awesome sauce! Really though, they were served with this spicy cheese sauce that was awesome.  It's a notch above the average sandwich shop and I wish they would open more locations closer to home or work.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident & absolutely glad I did! Not only are the sandwiches great, but the staff here is wonderful as well! I've been here a different times of the day and I'm always greeted and welcomed. I never know for sure what I want but the staff knows the right questions to ask to make my sandwich extra good!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and they have great service and the staff is friendly. They don't skimp on the meat and its juicy not dry. We had the cheese steaks and I loved the old bay fries and the sweet potato tots. We got to talk with the owner and overall this place is a hit. I cant wait to try the chicken cheese steak next time around."}
{"text":"You can always trust a Yelper (okay that makes it sound a little cult-y) and one day it was suggested that I try this place. Not a bad drive from my workplace, I ventured in one day.  The space is not large but accommodating- very bright and clean and comfortable. I was greeted by Bill who was the absolute nicest person I met all week. He asked if it was my first time at Original and gave me a quick tour of the menu. I settled for the Ultimate which is steak  with grilled salami on it. Seemed a little out of the ordinary, but it was featured by the cash register and I panicked, okay???  He asked my name for the order, but was so friendly and chatted with me several times during my visit. My sandwich came out quickly as did the beer battered fries. HELLO- beer battered fries. My life has changed. The sandwich was amazing. Excellent ratio of meat to toppings to bread. The bread had to have been freshly baked because it was soft and chewy, but still sturdy enough to hold my beloved sandwich together. I was pleased with the value, I got a lot of food for what I paid.  As I was leaving, same nice guy thanked me for coming in, made sure to tell me about catering and said he'd hope to see me again.  Anyone who says Customer service is dead should stop in to Original if anything, to restore your faith in good business practice.  :-)  I'll be a frequent luncher."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic philly cheese steaks. Cheese whiz and all. If you haven't tried it yet check it out."}
{"text":"So happy that I work within driving distance. The Roasted Pork with Broccoli Raab might be the best sandwich. It is only sold on Thursdays and you need to call and verify they have it because the proper cut of pork is not always available. I cannot wait to go to Philly and try one from Tony Luke's. This sandwich has been on my mind since Thursday."}
{"text":"Not all that impressed. The steak with provolone was OK, but bland and just a bit dry. Certainly enough meat, but not huge. The Bay fries, eh. Mommom's cole slaw, on the other hand, was terrific. Don't pass it up. Sharper and spicier than the usual over-sweet version common to this area.  This is a small place; just a few tables. I got there around 5 on a weeknight and was the only one in the place. I wouldn't call it the cleanest place I've ever seen -- perhaps showing its age? -- but it's not awful.  Fine for a quick meal, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak with peppers, onions, mushrooms and wiz. Little light on the veggies. It's all chopped together but would have appreciated a bit more. Bread, fantastic! Warm, soft, nice chew to it. Also ordered house fries. Some of the best I have had. Lots of food for what you pay."}
