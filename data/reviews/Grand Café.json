{"text":"I'm still fuming over a day later about our experience at Grand Cafe.  We just moved into the area, and had absolutely nothing in our fridge...and the babes were HuNgRy to say the least.  We decided to just grab a quick bite at the coffee shop because it was close to our house.

After waiting nearly 15 minutes, and watching numerous servers walk past our table, we motioned to another server who said \"our\" server would be there soon.  Another 5 minutes went past, and our baby was ready to throw a fit and crayons were only doing so much.  Our server, who's name has escaped me, finally came to our table to take our drink order.  

I politely asked for a coke and a water with lemon, an apple juice for the baby, and a hot chocolate for my 4 year old.  He repeated back a coffee, and for you sir.  I politely corrected him and he then asked if Pepsi was okay?  I said, no I will just have a water with lemon.  He then rolled his eyes and asked my husband for his order.  At that time the baby let out a scream and he stood there rolled his eyes and sighed extremely loudly making a scene over our crying baby.  He was obviously annoyed and less than enthusiastic, and annoyed by our children's preference.

My husband stood up and was irate over the way we were treated after our baby started crying because we had waited over 20 minutes for a drink order.  We spoke with the manager, who was even less helpful...and finally walked out and went to Panera to feed our babies.

Needless to say I've never been treated so poorly by a server who's main source of income is from tips.  I will never step foot into the Green Valley Ranch Resort because of the lack of care and concern from the management.  My friends are coming in to town for the weekend, and after the experience we had have canceled their rooms. We ran into a friend who was waiting to be seated, and he left as well.  

Moms and Dads beware!  The bald server is a JERK and the management is less than helpful!"}
{"text":"Please read full review before eating there. 

Food is great! No doubt about that and the price is excellent as well. You will have no server problems until the end when you're about ready to leave. 

& this is the reason I give it 1 star... Is because of the service from the \"manager\" and \"cashier\" that was received from them. The manager's name is Debbie I think and the cashier's name is Cathy. Debbie is just a rude manager but Cathy is something else! I've dealt with her 2 times already and 2 of the 2 times; I've never had someone give me such terrible attitude. I mean you do get terrible customers but I've never had such a bad vibe and attitude that Cathy has given. She needs to be retrained as an \"employee.\""}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was just okay. I got an omelette, which was pretty tasty. I also was served hash browns (greasy) and toast (burnt). The coffee was delicious though. It's a shame because I use to live this place. I'm thinking it's new management or cook."}
{"text":"There has been a LOT of turn over in the Grand Cafe at Santa fe over the past several months,we know -  because we hear it constantly from the waitresses...they are pissed....however , this is a review update about the food, which has stabilized recently. Their Mushroom soup on Saturday is to die for!!

Keep working on it"}
{"text":"Wow! I haven't even received my food yet and I am already so impressed! Anthony has been the one to serve my boyfriend and I this morning! He is filled with so much joy and probably one of the best waiters I have ever come across! He suggested us popular food items, joked with us, and has just been outstanding. I give Anthony 5 stars himself! I had a very great experience overall and I am pleased."}
{"text":"It was ok. Server was nice. But the coffee cup had lipstick on it & the chicken fried steak was disgusting! I hate complaining but its not servers fault. She was nice. But food was gross"}
{"text":"We went from 5x a week, to 4x, to twice, to very occasionally. The servers are fine but the kitchen is horrible. Servers there are frustrated. We go mid to late night and the little Hispanic manager is just tired of hearing complaints. Food is usually ok and priced fairly."}
{"text":"I came to the grand cafe a few months ago with my boyfriend. We had horrible service and disappointing food. We made a complaint that night. We finally got a call back about it yesterday. The manager offered to 'take care of us' the next time we come in. So we went today. The manager met us at the host desk, shook our hands and led us to our table. I was confused, was it a free meal? discounted? I had no idea. I got a burger and my bf had a steak dinner. The food was much better than last time but nothing to get excited about. The service was better too. But the waitress never said 'you're welcome' after I thanked her for refilling drinks.  It's a pet peeve. then the check came and my bf said 'the manager will take care of it' she seemed to know the situation and took the check away. We continued to sit at the table waiting for the manager to come by and discuss the bill or at least say something. But he never came by. So we started to leave. As we were walking out, the manager stopped us, shook our hands and said have a nice day. that was it. He was not rude but the whole thing was confusing and awkward."}
{"text":"So the service is horrible and  the food is lacking.  We waited for 45 minutes for food and the plates were so hot it seemed like it had all been sitting under heat lamps  for a really long time. My husband ordered pancakes and there was a syrup container made out of cast iron. It was so hot you couldn't pick it up and the syrup looked funny. We asked for another one and she picks it up and rushes to put it down at a nearby table (because it was freaking hot) and she leaves it there. She waits a few minutes and brings the same syrup back and tells us she got a new one! So a few minutes later we watch our server walking around with a large ice cream sundae. She walks around and talks to another server for 5 or 6 minutes as the ice cream melts. A couple then gets up and leaves. She watches them leave in a huff and then serves the ice cream to an empty table and left it there to melt   I ordered an omelet and it was alright. A friend ordered liver and onions but they forgot the onions.   We didn't get refills on drinks. The cashier at the end of the meal was also rude. Don't go to this restaurant. It is not worth your money or time."}
{"text":"A cup of soup 
Sirloin steak and a scoop of ice cream
What a dinner
Nice and fast service, 
Will come back"}
{"text":"Food was bland. Chicken was dry and flavorless, vegetables were overcooked and tasted strange. Mashed potatoes were good.  Service lacked enthusiasm or any amount of interest in working for a bigger tip.  He was nice enough, but had no energy.

Will never go back."}
{"text":"Yay the old Grand cafe is back!!! I went there this last Saturday for lunch I had a chicken buffalo salad ....sooo good! the service was excelllent...and I even got some donuts on the way out!!! Oh the donuts are soo good they are like the old Carls Dounuts!
 YUM...I will definety be back!"}
{"text":"Went in with a $10 credit coupon, and found it very very good.  Had the Vegas Shrimp cocktail (larger bay shrimp) and the Prime Rib Eggs Benedict... OMG it was great!  Was in at 3pm, so the service was great!  I had an apple fritter on the way out and it was fine.   I would go again, but the $10 coupon did inspire the visit."}
{"text":"I was recently a guest in this restaurant. I had heard a lot of good things about food and prices. I did enjoy my meal I ordered the new york steak and shrimp. It was good. I have to say that just moving here and being a first time guest here that the best part of overall experience was my food server. My server was Gabe. He was on top of getting my drinks, getting my food out as soon as possible. He was so friendly and made me feel very welcome and want to come back just for the customer service just because how great Gabe was. I would rate this restaurant 3 or 4 stars but because of this amazing server i will rate 5 stars. He was amazing."}
{"text":"We went hee for the breakfast special of 2 eggs, meat, hashbrowns and toast. 

Took about 15 minutes to be seated and there were several emty seats.  Then afer being seated too about 10 minutes to place our order.  After waiting about another 15 minutes we got our food. All this wait for eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. The eggs were suppose to be scrambled but they were on the runny side. 

There were a total of 4 of us and 2 had went and got a starbucks coffee before being seated and needless to say after 2 drinks and the specials we paid a total of $32.  We should have went to the buffet and got something cheaper."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, from when this was the Sunset Cafe through the Coco's debacle, and now to the Grand Cafe. I will say it is hit and miss. The late morning weekday seems to be the most consistent in terms of food and service. Our experiences have generally been terrible later in the day, even when they are not crowded. The service later in the day seems very inefficient and managers on the floor don't seem to know what to do in terms of expediting food, or seeing to seated guests, etc. However, the food at the newer Grand Cafe has been quite good. The waffles are very tasty. I usually have a Reuben sandwich made with sauteed mushrooms in place of the meat and they are very accommodating about that."}
{"text":"I was just eating the my breakfast I ordered from here. And I took a bite of my hash brown and found a hair cooked into my hashbrown, I had to catch myself and not throw up on the table. Yup I will never return here, and of course it was taken off my bill."}
{"text":"Went to the cafe for a early dinner. Server was okay , the $8.99 spaghetti and meatballs was not. The server was embarrassed by the serving size as it was child size at best. Asked for the manager and the server had already  told him my friend and I were totally disgusted with the serving size. Manager stated he knew it was small as he had been told to adjust serving fromo 12 oz to 8 oz. Our spaghetti was 5-6 oz at best. Manager reduced bill by 15 % and apologized knowing we had been screwed. After leaving Cafe went to Albertsons to get some chow for dinner. Not going back to cafe, usually service is bad . I would discourage anybody from eating here as there are better deals wherever you go."}
{"text":"We decide to go see Mockingjay 2 & then grab a bite to eat.  My girl had club sandwich and I had the prime rib special, I not a fan of green beans but I ate them all. I upgraded to sweet potato fries and the waitress even gave us extra that they had made. Coffee was hot and fresh and our waitress was was very attentive.  
We were full for desert but took home pastries from the case they look so good, we have them for breakfast."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are delish but the service is very slow.  Came here 3 times so far with 3 different servers. . .nothing the same.  The fist waitress took our order and then 20 mins later came back and said that the \"computer\" had a hiccup and didn't take our order and she threw away the original paper she took our order on.  So did that mean we waited 20 mins for nothing?!  The second time, the waiter was very friendly and prompt. . .well let me rephrase that, he worked as quickly as the kitchen allowed.  Oh but he forgot the soup.  Now this third time that I'm drafting the review now, the server didn't bring a straw for my son's drink.  We asked for it and he said he would get it now, asked again and then again until we finally got it.  15 mins after I get my hot chocolate he asks if I wanted whipped cream for it.  Once again, the server forgot food.  This time it was our short stack.  Service is always slow.  Hostess said it would be a 20 min wait for us to be seated but more than half the seats were empty.  They need a lot of improvment to live up to Green Valley's standards.  If the food wasn't ok we wouldn't have been back 3 times.  The only reason for the second star is because of the food quality and taste.  0 Stars for service!"}
{"text":"Our regular sunday breakfast group went here today, despite not so good reviews.  We are happy to report that the food AND the service were great!  Such a surprise after reading some of the reviews here.   Most of us had the Smoked Salmon Platter and it was excellent.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went to Green Valley Resort and Casino for the buffet but ended up at the Grand Cafe instead because we had two hungry children with us and the line at buffet was too long. 

First off they took over 10 minutes to seat us and they were not busy at all, a quick scan of the place revealed plenty of open tables. After getting seated we waited another 10 minutes just to order drinks, which took forever to get to us. 

When we finally ordered, you gusseed it, it took over 40 minutes for the food to get to us and the food was definitely not worth the wait. The salad my sister and i ordered alone took over 20 minutes to get to us. On top of the long wait they also forgot to bring out one dish.

The food itself was overly salty and looked like it was hastily thrown together last minute just to complete the order. The sandwhich I had fell apart and instead of getting whole wheat bread I was given white, but given I was starving I did not want to wait another 40 minutes for another sandwhich.

In summary super slow service and super salty and disgusting food. Had they been more busy I could forgive the long wait and the mediocre food but they clearly were not busy and the food was horrible. 

Unless you have lots of time and do not mind waiting for unappetizing food, go to the Grand Cafe at the Green Valley Resort, otherwise plenty of other options in the area. I highly recommend you stay away."}
{"text":"Love this place! Just got a chicken fried steak (Flintstone's size) with yummy mash potatoes and mixed vegis. They have Prime rib dinner for only $9.99, and it is delicious! Everything that the waitresses walked by our table with looked amazing. This place make me wish I was a cow with four stomachs, so I could pick four meals! They even have a bogo check in deal right now."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best.

Service absolutely sucks! I've walked out of here twice already and once tonite. Why? Because the wait staff refuses to help you or even acknowledge you. I have been blatently and purposely ignored by the waiters. You sit for 15 minutes and 5 waiters see you and hide or pretend to be busy and flat our refuse to help you."}
{"text":"We got seated quickly. The food was good. The price was good. And the wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Great place for a quick cheap meal in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"I was a little hungry after watching a movie & finally decided to try this place out & see what was happenin'. I was feenin' for a milkshake & was kind of wanting a burger as well. 

Initially I was lured over by the dessert display case on the outside & decided to look at a menu before committing to going inside. They definitely had burgers & shakes on the menu.

I ordered the Angus sliders with a side of thousand island dressing & a chocolate/strawberry shake.

The shake came out 1st & I was a little disappointed that it was brought out in a not so big glass, oh & where was the mixing cup with the extras?! Overall it was an ok shake, tasted like chocolate covered strawberries. So, I'm assuming there were real strawberries in there.

The sliders were really good & cooked nicely. It also came with a side of tasty fries & a little thing of coleslaw as well. Not a big coleslaw fan, but it wasn't bad.

The waiter was pretty entertaining & we had about 3 different people ask if we were doing ok, so that was a huge plus. I would definitely consider coming back & trying some of the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Grand Cafe is a pretty good little spot to eat at, if you're not in the mood for the buffet or the food court. The food isn't bad & the prices are pretty reasonable. It is definitely a lot better than when it used to be Coco's. 

The service is a little spotty & sometimes they forget to check on you. Otherwise, they are pretty pleasant & accomodating. I like the Keno runner that they have in the evenings as well. She is a really sweet & helpful older lady. She does it all. I have even seen her help out the rest of the crew cleaning up & whatnot.

Also, I really like the apple fritters & the bear claws that they have. Also, some of the other desserts are pretty decent as well. The mini cheesecakes, for example."}
{"text":"Our first time inside this cafe for breakfast! So happy we came here! Bruce was very friendly and hospitable! Extremely nice! 
Summer was are waitress who was sweet snd informative! Loved her!! She asked all the right questions with our order! 
I had the veggie egg white omelette came with hash browns and toast. My sister ordered the ham, eggs, potatoes skillet (4.99) huge portions!! 
Our total bill came to $21.00 we had two coffees too! Great coffee!! 
Love this place! Will definitely come back! 
Thanks to Bruce and Summer!!! Give them a raise!!"}
{"text":"2 days in a row we decided to eat here due to the fact that we where staying at GV resort. 2 days in row we where disappointed!!! Took 20 min to get drinks, food was cold and they never even put my wife's order in! Never will I come back!!"}
{"text":"Very good quality for the price.  Better than dennys or the buffet.  Play a little and get the $10 off coupons.  So worth it.   

Only neg is the soup selection.  Cream of something and chicken noodle Every time."}
{"text":"Station Casinos is a chain of Las Vegas casinos that are located away from the Las Vegas Strip and that are marketed to locals. Every Station Casino has a Grand Café, a 24-hour coffee shop. 

As a general rule, the food at Grand Cafés is OK; and the service ranges from bad to awful. We tried the Boulder Station location for the first time, and we were invisible. Although the place was almost empty (all Grand Cafés are usually empty) it took forever to get seated, and we were ignored from then on. I hate being invisible in a restaurant. 

After a long while we got up and walked out, and no one noticed."}
{"text":"Me and my mom have been going here the past 2 years i grew up just behind boulder station as it was being built never have had a problem with the service except one time with a server my mom had a drink coupon and slid it close to the end of the table and that particular server quickly slid it back in front of my mom and did not accept it which was fine but was very rude about it... but we had brought attention to the manager the next time we visited...I myself work with the public so i understand how difficult their jobs can be but overall i give 5 stars becuase i believe buisnesses deserve positive attention for great work and all the servers now and staff are great!!!"}
{"text":"Eat here often.  On the plus side, decent food, good service.  Outstanding bakery.  Negatives, pricey, portions getting smaller.
I miss old Vegas where you could eat on the cheap.....:("}
{"text":"I had been to the Grand Cafe a couple of times before writing this review.  I didn't want to seem unfair after just one visit since it has reopened. I had been several times in the past and loved it, for inexpensive food. But they closed and the location became a Coco's. A little while back the Coco's closed down and the Grand Cafe reopened. My wife and I were so excited. We gave it a try expecting the good food at low prices we had gone back again and again for. We went back again a few nights ago to have dinner with some friends. I am sorry to say that both my wife and I are very disappointed.

The Grand Cafe is clean; as a matter of fact it is very clean. I give them a lot of credit for that. But the restaurant itself is just kinda drab. It looks OK, but nothing jumps out at you.

The service is spotty. Sometime they are very attentive, and other times they are not. This was the same when the Grand Cafe was there before the Coco's and seems to be the same now. The other night I finished my beverage 3/4 of the way through dinner and was not asked if I wanted a refill until I was being handed the check; well after we had all finished and were ready to depart.

The taste of the food seems not to be very good any more. I have had the meatloaf & the Prime Rib. The veggies with both dishes were pretty good. The potatoes with each dish were OK as well, but nothing to write about. The meatloaf was very, very bad. The meat had been highly over mixed and had a almost slimy texture to it. There was no flavor to it at all. I had to add massive amounts of salt just to make it palatable. My wife had gotten the spaghetti and meatballs that night. They were awful. The sauce was sickly sweet and the meatballs were just like my meatloaf; disgusting. The other night I had ordered my Prime Rib medium rare. It came out medium well. And after it was cut, they had thrown on the grill. There was no pink to it at all. It was charred in some places and looked more like a stark that a Prime Rib. The flavor was acceptable, but just. All in all I am going to try my best to avoid going back. If friends want to go I will go again, but I will try to talk them out of it."}
{"text":"The Grand Cafe used to be a great place. Over the last year it has gone down hill. I have never been to a place where the servers stand around and argue over who is going to wait on a particular table. This happened the last 3 times we were there. The restaurant is always understaffed and you can expect to wait even if they are a 1/4 full. The food went from good to  very bland. Not a lot of effort on the quality of food. The management obviously does not care if you return or not. In our case we will not. Nice work STATIONS !!!"}
{"text":"We usually go here for Breakfast or late night snack.  We went there today and they no longer have the Breakfast special.  The response was due to the Bird Flu epidemic with eggs they had to raise all the prices.  It was a 40.00 Breakfast for three people.  We will not be going back anytime soon.  The food was still good but the prices are not."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this local restaurant! It's open 24/7, great prices, and amazing food. We love the buffalo sandwich and egg skillet special. The service is always excellent as well, very professional and quick. We'll keep coming again and again!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill everything is freakin buffet food! I went with a party of 10 and no one was impressed 
P.s. Nachos suck"}
{"text":"Honestly not the best food. Especially the prices. We waiting over an hour for our food and it wasn't packed, the taste from certain dishes were very plain. The water was nasty and the servers only came when they had to bring the food and drinks never before or after that to see how everything was or if we needed anything"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I got the Mediterranean frittata. It was light and simple. I also tried the lemon chicken, which was pretty good (6.5/10). Did not have to wait for our food as long as the previous reviews stated but we came at 2pm. Service was average. Overall this place is pretty average with fair pricing."}
{"text":"food was OK, service the worst ever, guests around us got up and left, the sever never came back around. this is the 1st time i never left a tip. 
there 3 items for $10 are the most cheapest food around, the only thing good is the brownie, I will never ever retun,"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast burrito i have ever had. The rest of the food was mediocre at best. Waitress was sneery."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff. We got seated and our drink orders taken quickly. It took a little longer than normal for the food to arrive, but it was so delicious there were no complaints.

If you have an hour to sit back and relax for a meal with friends, I would definitely recommend Grand Cafe.

Excellent crispy shoe string fries and coffee."}
{"text":"If you get a waitress name Esmeralda, you will have the worst service ever. The manager is useless . Do not come here for the steak and eggs special. There are many other places who has RESPECT. What they did was very unprofessional, unacceptable, and there are NO excuses. I would've gave them zero stars if I could and this is coming from someone who has a lot of patience and understanding."}
{"text":"Prime rib special is great. Good price for $9.99. Not much to day besides friendly staff and typical casino setting"}
{"text":"This place gets a bad rap! It's certainly not worthy of 5 stars but it's very consistent. Our favorite is breakfast. The waffles are great!"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed by the new and improved Green Valley Ranch Grand Cafe. It was clear to me from the moment I entered this cafe that the staff was well trained and everybody had a sense of pride in their new cafe. 
I'm rating my entree. I had the crispy chicken sandwich. This was by far the best sandwich I've ever had. Simple but the look on the plate was elegant. And for dessert I had a gigantic brownie topped with ice cream and whipped cream a cheery....And sprinkles! There were three more of us but I didn't try their food but I can say the salads look amazing and the steak was having me drool across the table! 5 stars gvr on hiring some exceptional cooks! 
Food has me wanting more! 
Also they did a great job on the remodel. The decor is classy and the place looks fancy and upscale. Thanks gvr for bringing the best cafe back to green valley!"}
{"text":"The place to go for late night! Good staff, reasonable prices, and great food. If you're there around midnight and are a club rewards member, they've got a late night menu that you can request. Highly recommend any of their Chicken Burger meals!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the atmosphere is horrible.  The lights keep dimming then getting bright.  I talked with the manager and he said he check into it. But the light kept dimming and brightening the whole time. Service was great even though they were busy"}
{"text":"We usually come here in the early, early morning for their boarding pass specials. The food is pretty consistent. Not exactly mouth watering, but good enough to satisfy the appetite. 

Randy the server is our favorite. He is cheerful, personable, friendly, and a very pleasant attitude, even in the wee hours of the morning.  Wish there was a way to commend him. At times he can be a little forgetful, but it's very easy to overlook such things when someone has a great attitude.

The hostess/cashier with the braces is friendly and pleasant as well."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday evening at 5:30ish told 30-40 minutes for our party of ten. We offered to split up to get seated but no, the wait would still be 30-40 minutes. Checked back after 15 because it just wasn't busy and she had 1hour quote by our name! But then we were seated right away. Walking through the restaurant there were TONS of empty tables. The table was preset with a selection of waters and a plate of lemons. I think a party left? We would have been smart to do the same. Our food came quickly enough but the 2yearold was served last, a little while after everyone else,  we gave her a plate from other plates. the food was pretty bad, some was not even edible. The Alfredo chicken was gross. The sides of veggies with crusted fish and chicken and biscuits were mainly onions and if you are going to serve Brussels sprouts you better have a phenomenal recipe because SURPRISE most people don't like them! Really bad! 
After my family left I handled the bill only to have some of my cash disappear between my table and the cashier! The manager gave me cash back but I was left feeling like this was my fault and ripped off! I also never was given a receipt! I would love to hear back from station casinos to change my review but right now I won't be back and I'll be steering all my friends away!"}
{"text":"I came across 3 employees not a single one was willing to help me. I asked to put a order in to go. One of them escorted me to the counter and told me to order with a server. I sat down and 4 minutes later, a manager type person asked if I've been helped, I said no. Then she gave me a menu and said let me give you one so a server knows you still need to order. 2 servers pass me up and takes an order  from another patron who has been waiting a fraction of the time I have been. The last time I ordered their bfast skillet they were able to substitute bacon for sausage. They \"can't\" this time, meaning they have some sort of selective service. And maybe they are trying to get rid of old bacon. Everyone seemed to be over 30 so as much as I bag on the young ones, these oldies really had a vague idea of customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Friday night 08/25/2017 (fight weekend). We were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait in spite of seeing the many open tables as we walked by. After waiting to be seated, we were greeted by our waitress who was quite friendly and placed our order. I ordered the chicken fried steak and upon receipt of my order was disappointed that it was mostly breading and not much steak. The green beans were flavorless. When we asked for extra napkins, it seemed to be a bother. 

We had the pleasure of overhearing another staff member swearing loudly as he mentioned he was on his way to take his mother f'ing break. It was not a pleasant experience at all and very unprofessional to say the least. We then had to wait for our check for what seemed to be a rather lengthy amount of time. We will not be returning to this godforsaken place anytime soon.

Too many people are having the same experience and until there is a change, I'm afraid this is going to be considered the new normal."}
{"text":"What sets this restaurant apart from other local casino \"café\" style eateries is the top quality of the beef. It's amazingly tender with the perfect balance of fat to meat. I've probably eaten here dozens of times and I keep coming back  - mostly for their $6.99 burger special (with fries, huge pickle slices, tomato and onion)  - that would literally cost up to $50 at snazzier places on the strip. 

Their huge roast beef dinner special ($11.99 with veggies, & choice of baked, mashed or fries)  melts in your mouth, and so does the grilled New York strip steak, with crispy onion strings, potatoes and vegetables $14.49) Note: avoid the $9.99 steak special as the meat is not as tender.

I've also had their meatloaf, the roast lemon and herb chicken (both $9.99 served with the same sides as the NY steak). These were just OK. Their club sandwich is gigantic, perfectly cooked bacon, tasty thinly sliced turkey, tomato, lettuce & mayo, totally yummy - $8.49.

Other reviewers complain about the service , I'm at a loss to understand this- I can only think of one time I had a real issue with a rude and incompetent server. My food has always been served hot, and only once did I send a steak back to be cooked as ordered.

Many of my friends love this place too, and they've ordered various sandwiches, soups and dinners and almost always enjoyed everything. Haven't done breakfast here."}
{"text":"I am always pleased when I dine here. BLT with avocado is amazing. The best eggs benedict I have ever tasted are served here. And the café special 1/2 pound burger is only $4.99 and is the best burger I have ever tasted. The servers are very attentive and efficient. I cannot name a favorite as Summer, Asalia, Yadira, and Belinda are all terrific. Hostesses Maria, Kay, and Courtney always accommodate my seating requests. All in all, a very nice restaurant serving excellent food at a reasonable price with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great special all day. Prompt service and hot food delivery! Clean environment and well maintained."}
{"text":"A great station cafe, food is always good here. I've been coming here on and off for years now and every time I come back the menu is always the same. The prime rib above average, the cafe is a way better alternative to the buffet. Great way to spend your comp."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Worst experience ever, took over 45 mins to get my food. On top of that it came out wrong. Although the server was able to comp a meal, I will definitely not eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for breakfast.  We were offered bottomless mimosas or bloodymarys for $10.00.  The first on arrived, we needed to ask for the second one......and now our waitress won't even look at us....very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service. We were rushed through the entire meal, yet had to forage around other tables for napkins and silverware."}
{"text":"Well I had my over medium runny eggs and shriveled up sausage that the waitress stated they precook ( seems like 2 days before) as if they were cooked fresh would take to long.  $10 for precooked sausage and eggs.  I would skip this place and head to dennys."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I am disappointed. I had the chicken noodle soup( dry chicken, great broth), sirloin steak (terrible cuts of meat, chef did what he could but one was edible but subpar, and the other had an old taste to it that I couldn't finish), it also came with mashed potatoes with onion crisps, okay, and sautéed spinach (inedible due to under cooking).  Then I had the apple cobbler- it was too sweet, no special flavor and the apples were hard.  I suggest you do not eat here unless you have had too much to drink and are extremely hungry. That way you won't  be able to tell the food isn't good.  The waiter was great though, his name was Dustin."}
{"text":"A little disappointed that their price for prime rib went up, but hey, it's still only 12 bucks! And worth every bite. Tender, juicy, and I never can eat all of it, so makes great leftovers."}
{"text":"Went there so many times good food nice people Andy Belinda Summer all nice even hostess but then we went got a young girl who didn't like gays treated us like we were invisible  we walked out never go again.her name wasJessica tossed my salad at me and never said excuse me or sorry walked away.Station should be ashamed for having people like her there . This is my opinion a zero"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here during the night. We go often actually. He usually get the male server Dylan. I cannot remember exactly but he is decently good. One time we had horrible service but when we requested a new server Dylan came and rescued our meal. We always get the shrimp cocktail & I'll get the banana fosters or steak breakfast. Everything is super delicious."}
{"text":"Good food & nice inexpensive menu for player's card but oh so slooooooow.  We have been here for over an hour & still waiting for our bill.  Waiter said it is taking an average time of 25 min to be served.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Grand Cafe is back!  Decently priced food with really large portions allows you to have a 2nd meal the next day.  Dinner and lunch items are good like the sandwiches, salads, steaks, and the currently, the prime rib special for $9.99 from 4pm to 11pm.  Prime rib is a 12 oz cut, very tender with choice baked potato, and steamed vegetables.  Prime rib and potato is good, but the vegetables were oversteamed.  

The breakfast skillets are a little too greasy for my taste.  Omelettes are good and very large.  

Service is kind of slow, but if you are a party of 1, just ask to be seated at the bar area so you don't have to wait for a table.  Service is faster at the bar."}
{"text":"You gamble, then you want steak. It's natural. I went to the Grand Cafe and saw a 7.99 New York steak special. That's all I wanted, some steak. I order the \"special\" and am met with a 15 dollar tab. I was told by the server and the cashier that the fault was mine. I needed to request a special menu and order accordingly. They would not budge on this miscommunication. They both said \"well next time....\"  There won't be a next time. I feel swindled. I had 7 dollars taken from me today. And there was no sense of customer service or satisfaction. I thought the gambling was left to the casino, not the restaurant. Shame on you Geand Cafe for your bait and switch."}
{"text":"Very small side portions.  I ordered Fish and Chips, which in this cafe is pricey. 
The fries were the frozen skinny type, yuk.  The portion of Cole Slaw was a joke. It came in a very tiny cup. I got 2 small bites. The fish was ok."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went in, since we were close to Santa Fe Casino. 
The wait wasn't long at all to be seated although we originally asked for a booth, and the \"manager\" tried to seat is at a regular table. We asked if there were any booths, yet again, and she mentioned it would be a 10 minute wait. Meanwhile there is an empty booth right behind us that seemed to just need cleaning. 
2 minute wait time. (Seats were still dirty too. Ew.)
Meanwhile WE grabbed our own menus, and decided what to eat. There were multiple waiters that continued to pass us but never stopped to take our order. After 10-15 minutes Art comes out and takes our order and brings us our drinks. He completely disappears on us as we wanted to play Keno and even the \"manager\" who helped us at the beginning was no where to be found. We waited almost an HOUR for our food. We were starving. We waved down one of the bussers and asked him to check on our meal since Art was gone. Even a table he was waiting next to us, left since they waited longer than us. Finally food comes out, it's okay. Typical for the price you pay. That's expected. But even when we were done with empty plates, we had to waive down another busser to get our check. FINALLY Art comes and delivers our ticket. Funny how they come out when they expect you to tip them for the AWFUL service. Ha!"}
{"text":"Formally Coco's, now the Grand Cafe. 

I'm a few miles away from Boulder Station and came to have something to eat right quick. I didn't feel like anything else that was open in the area or cooking. Metro Pizza sounded great but they were already closed, so I went next door. 

The place looks much more nice than the Coco's that use to occupy this space. All the tables were set nicely, new paintings on the wall, and smiles on the employees faces. The service was very good. My drink was constantly full and I got my appetizer soup promptly after ordering. 

The menu had reasonable prices and the food looked great. The Prime Rib Special looked very good, but that is until 11pm and it was already after midnight. Instead I went with a Bacon Cheeseburger with seasoned fries. The burger was a very good size and filling, I didn't even finish it! It came with thick cut bacon, slice of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. The fries were hot and good. 

Overall, the food was basic and good. What stood out most was the service they provided. They are really putting in a good effort to make this place more customer friendly with excellent service. I will revisit and try the Prime Rib next time."}
{"text":"Wow. Well first were told 45 minutes to sit. When we show her chairman card that goes down to 15-20 minutes!!! Awesome, good sign huh? 
NOPE. Get seated, 15 minutes later no one has spoke to us at all. 
Go back to hostess area \"can we get sat somewhere that has a waiter\" ok , so they move us... I set the timer ... 8 minutes later Kimmy comes up to us. She's pleasant enough but not gonna lie I am pissed off by now. 
I complain a little and shes receptive. We order ... First off I shoulda kept my mouth shut cause our salads were the biggest hardest pieces of lettuce imaginable. Second the nachos looked like they were off someone else's plate and them they just threw chips on top... Look at the pictures... Its nasty and looks like mop water in the plate. Perhaps it is after my complaining that I got dirty mop water ..."}
{"text":"Service was ok. But the food is mediocre at best. Their steak is horrible. When you say medium rare, they give you well done. Their dinner deals are simple, but if you expect your meal to look exactly like the picture or what's described in the menu?? You're better off going to the food court and ordering from there. Not worth coming here for dinner any longer. Took them 20 mins to get me my check"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent guest at this café and usually very pleased with the food.   However, I was very disappointed with the food on my last visit.  I ordered the 'Asian Chicken Salad ', the lettuce was yellow and brown.  I attempted to eat it but could not get past the salad's appearance, I pushed it away after two bites.  I didn't complain to my server, who removed  my salad without asking me if anything was wrong with the food.   I will give this cafe another try,  but will not order the salad."}
{"text":"Awful Christmas dinner. Turkey thick and processed. Beef tough. Long wait for table and after ordered at table. May be extraordinarily bad due to Christmas Day but even so not acceptable"}
{"text":"The only meals anyone should order here are their  breakfast food. I ordered steak and shrimp medium rare, but when I cut into the steak it was really \"rare\" very bloody, as if the steak was grilled for only 20 seconds on each side. Needless to say, I did not eat the steak nor would I mention the issue to bring it back to the kitchen. #1 rule - Never bring food back to the kitchen. The Belgian waffles were very good though. My little one really enjoyed it. The service was slow as always. I just except that from any casino cafe. They are normally busy or lacking any additional help and the waitress can only do so much."}
{"text":"Four particular patrons dined on typical breakfast fare served to near perfection by Carolyn !  Request for jam other than strawberry for one... Did not produce the Grape as promised. This alone keeps me from offering 5 stars! 

Diners in this party were very picky and each request was met, crispy bacon here, medium there, eggs well done here.... Creamers and coffee kept full with out us having to ask!  Good respectable food for the money good service!"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday on 1.17.16, our waitress was kind & sweet- until she left. She explained Summer was supposed to take over, but she never came over at all. My friend & I didn't see her once! Never got refills on our drinks, not even an introduction such as 'Hi, I'll be your new....' etc. Left no tip, very disappointed.

Except for the poor service, we did have delicious food (had the special $4.99 burger, my friend had the special breakfast platter, $5.99). Would go back again for another try just for the food!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't even give one star!!!!!!! 
I believe in costumer service and tipping considering I'm in this industry, I also believe that sometimes it's busy and as a bartender/server I know it gets busy and crazy!!! But when it's 2am and I'm waiting around for a water for over 30 mins I find that completely unexceptional. The manager was a joke when I politely asked for him he didn't help out even the slightest. BUT the girl at the front was a little helpful, otherwise I will never return."}
{"text":"Came in for the Corn Beef and Cabbage,, which by the way, was really good. My Aunt and Uncle invited me to their favorite Casino restaurant for this meal. Now here is the reason I can't give (5) Five Stars,, one of the reasons my Aunt/Uncle invited me was because they had accumulated \"free dinner\" coupons,, in fact they explicitly informed waitress of intention to pay with said coupons/points,, but upon finishing meal and going to cashier,, they were told coupons can't be used on holidays. Today is St Patrick's day? When did a day that the City/Government/County work become a holiday? Answer: \"we just implemented \"
What if we couldn't pay? I guess we'd be washing plenty of dishes"}
{"text":"My family came in from Los Angeles, CA and we went to the Grand Cafe at Sunset Station for the Prime Rib dinner.  One person ordered the Chicken Farfalle and when the order finally came * out the prime ribs were discolored from sitting under the heat lamps so long, the Chicken Farfalle was lacking flavor and consistency in the Alfredo Sauce.  The Sauce was so watery that it made the dish taste really bad.  *It took about 30 minutes for our meal to come out, which is a long time considering the prime rib is cooked earlier and held in a warmer, and the chicken/pasta dish is all pee cooked and just needs to be reheated.  When we brought it to the attention of our server, she was very apologetic and she told the manager who didn't come out and handle this situation or even apologize.  The did give a small discount for the inconvenience.  I come here often but not sure about a return visit.  I was generous with 2 stars because of the server."}
{"text":"bloody awful!!
it takes 49 minutes to be served a 2.99 breakfast that consisits of 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast. ordered a side of acavado thay was served completely   brown... told management... all they said was ill take off your breakfast. no apologies..nothing for wasting an hour of my time. this is not the first time waiting for ages for the 2.99 breakfast
 
maxine is a gorgeous waitress. definitely want to give her lots of praise!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience
Service is quite nediocre
Worst steak and eggs I ever had.
The waitress Carolina brought the eggs out first, the steak came 15 minutes later by which time the eggs and toast and hash brown were all cold
Some other waiter came by the table and made a rather insincere apology 
Wont waste my time again"}
{"text":"Ruel our server was funny & definitely would brighten anyone's morning!  Excellent service & specials, like at the other Stations Casinos Grand Cafe's!  For only $16.19, I fed myself & both of my parents, plus used my Stations Casinos Card & it was basically free.  

Also I love that every October they make these special Breast Cancer awareness pastry's at each of the Grand Cafe's."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning for breakfast, were not that many people. 
Was sat in a booth, after 10 minutes no one came to see what I wanted. 2 other parties were seated after me and they were attended to. Still no one. Complained as I walked out, all the cashier could say was sorry, I doubt that I will return, so no breakfast, yes a little pissed, better service at a fast food place. Try a little customer service now and then!"}
{"text":"Biz as usual for station casino cafes... waiters ignore you. Sit down and 10 waiters walk around not wanting to help you. After being ignored for 15 minutes I walked out."}
{"text":"Thank you chefs for bringing back the Chicken Cordon Bleu.  My best friend is vegan & got the Quinoa salad w/ no egg which was delish!  Happily surprised tonight w/o my two fav bartenders not being here & had excellent service & food.  Gotta give credit when it's due & glad I gave you all another shot."}
{"text":"Went there twice on weekdays for dinner.  The first time had the 3 course special for $10.99, and was  better than I expected.  The chocolate dessert was very good.  The Caesar salad had the right amount of dressing and crunchy croutons.  The waitress was great, although getting seated took a while. The wine wasn't bad either.  The second time had just a salad and the shrimp cocktail, which was full of delicious shrimp.  Once again, getting seated and ordering took a while, but the food was reasonably tasty and well priced."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, just your basic american traditional food,  the prices are reasonable. My only issue is the late night menu is very disappointing, not many choices at all."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner. I had the wings (they were good) next time I'd get them dry with the Buffalo and Blue Cheese sauces on the side. Also had fries - they were hot and served in a cute mini fry basket! My wife had the French Onion soup, she said it was ok. Their pastries are Awesome!"}
{"text":"On Thurs 01/04/18, while driving home from work, I got a craving for the spaghetti and meatballs at the Grand Café (Santa Fe Station). I have had this meal on numerous occasions and always enjoyed it. We are locals to Santa Fe Station and have been players and guests at their dining venues for many, many years. 
My husband and I arrived for dinner and were promptly seated. Of course, I ordered the spaghetti and my husband the hot turkey sandwich. We both added a salad to our meals. Here we go: 
Salads, while cold, were limp and the vegetables appeared \"stale\". Clearly not fresh. Husband left most of his. 
Food came out ... I was never aghast when looking at a meal but when I saw what they placed in front of me I was dumbfounded. The meatballs were completely black on the outside. There were two full meatballs and one that was a half - looked like it fell apart and they left it on the plate. The meatballs looked like they were sitting in a pan all day, or even longer, and just blackened away. Needless to say, I let the server know and over came the manager. He looked at the plate and agreed. Asked what I wanted and I told him spaghetti and meatballs that were not black. BTW ... husband's sandwich was OK ... just a bunch of white bread with some turkey and gravy on it. Not the most appealing. 
I waited and waited. By now, my husband had finished his meal. Out comes the manager with another order of the spaghetti and guess what ... black meatballs yet again. He proceeded to tell me that the chef baked them up fresh ... are you kidding me? You can bake meatballs in under 10 minutes? They were just as black as the first order. I can only assume that they scraped as much of the black off that they could and then put it all in the microwave to heat it up. The toasted bread that came with the meal was completely limp and wet ... microwaves will do that to bread. I couldn't believe they would let that meal out of the kitchen and place it in front of a guest. I told the manager that this was totally unacceptable and that I was done. He offered me another meal ... if I wanted a sandwich or burger I would have ordered that. Then he offered a pastry ... now there's a great dinner! We got up and left. I without any dinner and wasting over an hour of my time. 
The following day I wrote Santa Fe Station via their website and provided feedback on this experience. It has now been over a week later and I have not received any response or acknowledgement. I must say, this is not the first time of having a bad dining experience at the Grand Café, and when providing feedback, no one ever responds."}
{"text":"like a fancy dennys . theyre banana cream pie is a must ."}
{"text":"Glutton for punishment. Gave it ANOTHER chance. 8 tables had parties and the rest of the restaurant was empty - at 5 pm on a Friday night. Not a good sign. Yet we were told it was a 20 minute wait. We left after 10 minutes. 

Never again."}
{"text":"3 stars is generous. Food was actually good, had a perfectly medium rare steak. Chicken fried steak looks and taste amazing. Service is a different story. 

The hostess is on the grave shift is very polite, she seated us immediately, even got us drinks when the waitress was occupied. Other than that, service was abysmal. Our table was ignored through the whole meal. Did not once get a refill, my plate had the wrong eggs, wait staff visited and checked up on every table but ours."}
{"text":"The proportion of the food is reasonable but the quality is alright. I order the T-bone Streak cook at medium rare was actually towards well done. The meat is dry and not tender. It was thin, but the bright side was is only 9.99

While the chicken sandwich was exceptionally better because the chicken was fried."}
{"text":"While staying at the Santa Fe Station Casino recently, I had breakfast in the Grand Cafe'.  My waiter was awesome, the food was good, although a bit pricey.  The decor was beautiful, and the booths very comfortable.  If I stay there again, I won't hesitate to eat there again."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at the Grand Cafe' last week.  Service by Greg was very good and friendly, and the food was good.  The ambiance was pleasant and the price was very good.  Would eat there again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"For being inside a nice station casino, I was not impressed at all with \"Grand\" Cafe. 

After being seated by a not so friendly hostess, we were quickly greeted by our server, who is the only reason I gave this place a second star. We were just looking for a quick bite to eat so we decided on sharing a couple appetizers; chicken tenders and a chicken quesadilla. It took 20 minutes for our food to arrive which was more than ridiculous for how slow they were at the time. The chicken tenders were luke warm and were some of the worst I'd ever had. As for the quesadilla, Del Taco has better. And not once were our water glasses refilled. 

We'd hope to turn things around a little by ordering a brownie sundae since how can you really go wrong there. Worst dessert I've ever had. The only good part of it was the ice cream. The brownie was cold and hard and the whipped cream tasted off.

Don't waste your time with this place, you can get better things to eat in the food court around the corner for a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"3 stars for our server, James, keeping our drinks full and the quick service provided over all. That's it. 

I used to eat here pretty frequently about 5 years ago and the food was always really delicious, that I remember anyway. 

Seems their menu has shrunk considerably and so has the quality of food. I got the chicken fried steak which was good but totally overloaded with breading, and it was almost as if they fried it to long or it started to get to that point because the edges of the meat and the breading were fried hard. Eww.  My Cesar salad looked really sad with wilted lettuce. My hash browns were over fried and my eggs were wet slimy like. Bleh! My cousin had the fried chicken which she said was good but her steamed veggies were still hard, complete with dried out carrots and a cold baked potato. 

The only reason I would come back here is prob if I was severely intoxicated and it was the last place on earth to eat something to help soak up the cohol. We had more fun building a mountain out of food we didn't eat. We felt the food was put to better use and looked nicer that way :)"}
{"text":"The Grand Cafes at Stations Casinos provide tasty, inexpensive food rapidly and with a smile.  Not much more to be said."}
{"text":"Came in to try the 9.99 special  they're advertising.I had the steak which was a little bit more. The steak was tuff. I think shoe leather tastes way better . And I  have  never eaten  shoe leather. I must say the management  staff  was on point  after  telling them  how  the food  tastes .They  discounted  my meal which  was ok but still  I can't  get the bad taste out of my mouth. Oh btw the Root beer  was the best thing  going"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for breakfast and so far, I am not disappointed.

We had the breakfast special, coffee, two orange juices and a bowl of oatmeal for only 24 dollars, the drinks can be pricey, but that isn't any different from any other restaurant you visit, since the return on profit for drinks is very high.

The food and service in my opinion was great, friendly staff and fast service.  We visited mid morning on a weekday, so it was not too busy, I'm sure during the weekend, the service may vary.  Our food was served in about 10-15 minutes, the one bowl of oatmeal was huge, I had to share it.

They do have breakfast, lunch and dinner specials so pay attention to the menu when you browse through it, the specials will save you some money if you are on a budget.  Or ask your server what the specials are.

You also have the option of sitting at a booth, a table or at the lunch counter, for this visit we sat at the counter, there is also one large flat panel TV in case you want to catch the scores or watch the news while you eat at the counter.  You can easily see the entire seating area to determine how busy the restaurant is.

There is also a Starbucks located right outside the entryway to the Cafe, in case you want another coffee to go.  I will definitely visit this cafe again during my next trip to Vegas or Henderson."}
{"text":"Every time I come here to eat, I regret it.  Not sure why I keep coming back; maybe the atmosphere.  Food and service are terrible."}
{"text":"I know not to expect high quality beef for late night specials, but this was probably the worst one I've had. I feel like whoever was cooking it fell asleep and let it turn to jerky  on the grill. 

Seemed like other guests also had complaints on their food, because I saw one of the cooks come out and deliver food to a couple tables.

The service is much better during normal hours."}
{"text":"I am in Las Vegas because a business trip. This cafe is next to my hotel, so I am having now very tasty night breakfast. I ordered eggs with spinach and some bread. And some other tasty stufs. And of course coffee. In deed the coffee is nice, actually the are offering acceptable selection of soft and refreshing drinks. This place is not full of people. I can describe the service and customer treatment as good, not best but just acceptable for a 24\7 cafe. The prices are moderate. Good for night snack."}
{"text":"I went here about a few days ago and ordered the banana fosters French toast (highly not recommended). After it was give to me it was doused and drenched in syrup (not caramel). For an example of caramel, I asked for a side of caramel, the texture and color difference was absolutely visible. Do not waste your time, money, or patience here, the cooks and servers certainly don't.


As a side note, I frequent this place, but after observing how they handle and how long they let their food ferment, it will be the last, this goes for their world famous bakery. Most of it sits for weeks."}
{"text":"Dumpster fire. The horrible service is only topped by the horrifically prepared slop. Everything was horrible, from the dry turkey on the sandwiches to the stale burnt bread. The onion rings are watery oily vomit inducing garbage. The open faced turkey was dry old lunch meat with a dark brown gravy and powdered potatoes! So puke inducing I didn't photo it. Honestly, one of the worst meals I've had in Vegas in the 27 years I've lived here. Close it down and rent the space to denys, it couldn't be worse."}
{"text":"My go to place in Vegas.  We don't stay near the Strip or Downtown.  Texas Station has few tourists....mostly locals.  Their restaurants are clean, staff friendly and hardly ever a wait to get seated.  

Grand Cafe is open 24/7 with a full menu.  Price is great.  Tip:   Don't forget $10 bottomless Bloody Marys!"}
{"text":"Marina and the cashiers were so nice and friendly, I forgot about the rubbery shrimp cocktail. I ordered the turf and surf, it was very good diner food. The Budlight was impressive, as always. The Sunset Station is a cool and elegant casino to spend an afternoon on your own or with friends. My mother and her girlfriends come here for the buffet. They are never disappointed and love staying in touch at this casino. I am a fan of Texas Station, due to being in my neighborhood, however, it's nice to know Stations has a different theme to each of their properties. Regardless of the venue, I make a pit stop at The Grand Cafe. Thanks for hiring an amazing staff...they truly love locals here. ;o)"}
{"text":"I am not sure where to start the review. The staff are sweet and attentive, however, when the mood is low it seems to affect everyone. I come here regularly and I have noticed service go from depressing to amazing with all the staff.

The food is a hit and miss , but overall it's good. I particularly enjoy the prime rib. I tried the fried chicken and I was not impressed even with my easy ratings.

I am not sure what to say. Either the staff don't like their menu or they don't like working here on certain days."}
{"text":"This place is a horrible disgrace to station casinos!  The slowest service ever.  You may be seated but never get a waitress to take your order.  This restaurant is horribly understaffed and the staff who are working definitely don't care about the patrons.  They'd be better off if you ordered your food at the register and they called your name when ready and had no service at all bc that's basically what you get!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE INEDIBLE FOOD!!!!

Time was at 4:15PM 1/17/2015 for any GVR management that wants to look into this. 

Service was extremely slow, probably a 20-30 minute wait after ordering to get the food.

I ordered the 1/2 deli sandwich , soup and salad combo.  The salad had the roots or hearts of the lettuce and cabbage in it, the parts that are normally thrown away.

The roast beef sandwich should be called the \"raw beef sandwich\" it was pink, soft and tasted like regurgitated bile, it looked very similar to the \"pink slime\" product the fast food places used to put in their burgers. The only thing edible was the chili.

All the employees had a bad attitude after I told them the meal sucked, especially the cashier, a 20-something Caucasian girl with long brown hair. 

The only decent person of the bunch was the young Hispanic girl waiting my table, she made sure the manager took the food off the bill. They really should have comped the whole meal for serving that pig slop. 

My only regret is that I didn't take a picture of the pile of manure they called a sandwich , the picture would have hit home for people better than I could ever have explained it."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. 20 minute wait at our table to be waited on. Waitress with attitude and a manager with no apologies. Terrible food. No pre-bussing at our table. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Cool place we love it it's inside of the casino and we always have a great time great price good tasting and great service"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Sante Fe for over 20 years. We remember when this cafe was really great, but 5 years ago, we had the slowest service ever and quit going after the movies. A few days ago, I went back with friends and decided to give it another chance. Not much has changed, slowest service imaginable and even the food is terrible now. Omelet had no taste but grease and my friend's burger wasn't cooked properly. Maybe I should try in the next 10 years (if its still there)."}
{"text":"We come here either when we have guests staying in town or when we're up real late and want breakfast. This past visit it was for both reasons.

Kind of a bummer that their menu changed a bit. Pretty sure the selections for late night have been pared down. The Rocky Road Pancakes are 86'd.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-caf%C3%A9-henderson-3?filter_by_userid=True&select=bVJqy_XA7GaRocePyarYZQ&userid=2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg#nuOLtM-BZGT6GMW-Z99RXg) That's a bummer! Oh well, not like I need to eat that anyways. They also raised the prices. It's still reasonable, but I talked it up with my out of town guests as this place had great deals. Not so much anymore.

For what it's worth, the chicken fried steak that came with a biscuit and both smothered in country gravy with eggs and hash browns was not too bad and a good deal for $8.50 . The Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae with lots of whip cream did not disappoint either. My niece gave it a thumbs up. Both orders were good sized portions.
  
It was busier than I expected for a week night but service was pretty good. Our server was courteous and attentive enough. The host was really friendly.  Our orders came out in a timely matter. We all enjoyed our late night eats here."}
{"text":"Station Casinos have captured my heart with their 24-hour cafes.  In this case, the Grand Cafe. 

Breakfast for dinner?  
Late-night munchies?


Just come here.  I've never left here disappointed.  I'll always order the egg white scramble, and it's just so good and healthy.  Egg whites scrambled with spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes, complete with a side of buttered toast and--get this--GRAPE JELLY (upon request).  You sold me.  You had me at grape. 

Service has always been good, sometimes great, though nothing to write home about. 
Good value.  I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent breakfast, don't bother leaving the complex of the Green Valley Ranch complex. (The previous day, we had walked 2 miles away off the complex for an early morning breakfast, and it sucked.). We stopped by Grand Cafe and had a traditional breakfast: eggs, sausage/bacon, hash brown and eggs. Really hard to screw up. So, the food was decent and hit the spot! More importantly, we had wonderful customer service with our server, James, who was AMAZING and took really good care of us. The coffee was strong and hot, the food was decent, and despite all the bad reviews listed on Yelp, we were pleasantly happy with our meal. Truly, it was James who topped it off for us, as he made sure we had to-go cups of coffee and was truly attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"This cafe is closing down, it will be replaced with Pancake House and the old Pancake House will be replaced with TGI Fridays'. 

If you had the pleasure of meeting the good chefs and cooks that worked certain times you were sure to have a good meal. Its cafe food, and they really had some good specials and deals. Ill miss this late night place."}
{"text":"Eh... I'd rather skip this place. 

We have dined here several times at various times of the day.  I've tried to give this a fighting chance but they lost.  It's open 24 hours and conveniently located in GVR so I realize it's an easy option.  But here's my assessment.  

Breakfast- food was ok but the waitress had an issue with bringing the table waters.  She stated you had to order them and she didn't want to refill them.  Strange.  

Lunch- again the food was ok but had an incident.  A waiter had dropped a huge tray of dirty dishes near our table.  Ketchup had flown all over my husbands pants.  An apology perhaps? Nothing.  Strike 2.  

Dinner- 3rd time food was less than ok.  Sandwich was really dry, steak was horrible and the quesadilla was blah.  Our service that evening was good but it still couldn't make up for the food. 

Every meal served mediocre or less than mediocre food.  With the other options in the resort and the nearby District area, i would choose elsewhere.  You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Crappy service. From the hostess to the waiter, they didn't seem to care. Seemed very understaffed. Took 40 minutes to get food and had barely six tables worth of customers in the whole place. Almost left. Wrong drinks. Had to chase someone down to get anything. Food below average. I get it's a coffee shop so wasn't expecting anything spectacular but this is pretty bad. Couple of dry patty melts, runny scrambled eggs that were a little tougher than is normal. Only thing that was somewhat edible was the club sandwich. Cashier asked how our meal was told her it was bad and about how we were about to leave before food arrived. She said .... I'm sorry and will let management know... No wait that wasn't it. At least that would have been some consolation. She said... Oh... And nothing else. Lol ya they just don't give a crap. Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Service was great! Have no issues there. Her name started with an L, she was personable & funny, very sweet lady. Food and kitchen staff not so much. We've lived here for 8 years, I'm the GM of 2 very successful restaurants here in the valley. My parents were here visiting from Cali for my sons birthday. All 8 of us go to the Cafe for breakfast before they head back home and 6 out of 8 we're disappointed in the food. My parents plates were wrong, moms food was on dads plate and dads on moms. My plate had items on it that I specifically asked to be kept off & the cheese I asked to be added was nowhere to be seen. The toast was so hard and crunchy I can only assume that it was the first thing the line cook dropped & the butter that should be on the toast was no where in sight. We'd never been to eat at any of the Cafes in any of the Stations & after this I don't think I'll be back. Buffets great ate there last night, Cafe not so much. Server had the manager remove one of the breakfast items but manager did not come and check on us. There was no apology or \"I'll provide better training for my cooks\" nothing came from the management. Highly disappointed there."}
{"text":"Worst Grand Cafe I ever been too. It is poorly ventilated, and reeks of cigarette smoke soo bad that it set my asthma off. I been to Grand Cafes in other casinos, and even though there was smoke in the area, they were better ventilated than this this location. There is ALWAYS a wait, even if the place is  practically EMPTY.  Went there one Saturday at 1am after seeing a movie and the host told us we had a 30 min wait. I looked over her head to the right side of the dinning room that was EMPTY and she saw me looking and told me that there is no one working on that side, so they are only using the left side. What is it too hard for the server to walk a few feet to the other side. I was not going to wait 30 mins @ 1am to get something to eat. I left. The other time we went there, the hostess was really rude and not friendly at all. When it was time to leave, we had to wait for the check for more than 20 mins after we ate. The server kept passing our table up to help the other tables, I actually had to get up, walk to him and ask him for our check. The only reason why I still rated it two stars was because the food. We had a T-bone steak and it was awesome. Bravo to the cook. But everyone else + everything else = epic fail. I will drive all the way to Red Rock to the Grand Cafe there. It is so inviting, so clean smelling, service is great and food is beyond awesome and I NEVER had to wait more than 10 mins. I will even give the Grand cafe at Texas station a better rating than the one at Sante Fe station."}
{"text":"Went with a friend a few days ago.  Asked for a patio (indoor) table but my request was ignored and after waiting quite a bit we were seated near the counter.  Service was good but the male waiter kept touching my shoulder.  Once or twice is OK but 4-5 times?  Not right.   Came up at one point when he wasn't sure about the drink order and said \"I had a brain fart\"!  WTH you NEVER say that when you don't know someone well or you're in the service industry job.  Anyway, my patty melt was good which can be served with either fries, cole slaw or fruit.  Menu items were average in # they should be more for a \"Grand\" Cafe.  Not bad will go back but I hope that waiter won't serve me again!"}
{"text":"Just had a lovely conversation with Jack. He was rude and instead of apologizing and got very defensive. Been in Vegas almost 10 years. Been visiting for 20.

I miss Old Vegas, he's one of the guys that ya know wouldn't have a job. 

The staff doesn't seemed to thrilled either.

Thank you Jack for being a shinning example to your staff.

The food was excellent.
Service amazing."}
{"text":"I'm being nice by giving the place 2 stars. First of all 2 stars because on previous occasions, we have received EXCELLENT customer service and great food. If I could give this place negative stars for my experience tonight, I would have. Hubby and I have come here a handful of time because it's so close to our house. Normally, we get the burger deal (get a big burger and fries for $5.99). Appetizers are really cheap and there's a chocolate cake here that's pretty tasty too. 

We sat down right before 7pm. About 5 minutes later our drink order was taken (we just got waters). Water was delivered by the bus person. 5 minutes later, we ordered chicken fingers, the Frisco Burger and the Classic Burger. Never once was the waitress nice. Felt like I was Ed Debevic's for a minute (for all of you who know what that is) except this waitress wasn't acting. Hubby goes to the sports book to score free beer. I get a text from him at 7:15pm telling me he's watching the game and will be right back. He comes back at 7:30pm. By this time, the waitress refills my water acting like it's such an inconvenience to do so. Appetizer arrives soon after. We eat our chicken fingers and wait. It's now 7:40 and he says, \"I'm gonna use the bathroom and get another beer. Our food better be here when I get back.\" He leaves; I break out my Reader's Digest. Waitress walks by saying, \"Your food is coming up.\" No apologies or explanations. Practically a \"drive-by.\"

All this time EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS BEEN SEATED AFTER US HAS THEIR FOOD ALREADY. 

7:55pm, food comes out. She sets in on the table and says nothing. Normally I say, \"Thank you.\" I chose to not even waste my breath. 7:57pm, Chris comes back. I eat half of my sandwich before I decide that I've lost my appetite. By 8:05pm, I tell him to ask for a box - - didn't want to waste anymore time. I go to the bathroom and tell him if she comes by, he can order the cake. I come back by 8:10pm and he says, \"Guess she's having a bad day and we aren't worth her time.\" I ask, \"What happened?\" He replied, \"She walked by the table and I said, 'Excuse me...' and she said she's be back with another water (not even what we were wanting. He then ordered the chocolate cake and she impatiently said, \"You want it to go?\" Hubby said, \"No, we're eating it here.\" Cake comes out 5 minutes later; we eat what looks like HALF of their normal slice and waited for the check. She came back and we paid it and left. 

NO TIP. TIP = To Insure Promptness. Not gonna tip for crappy service. I don't care if it was the kitchen's fault. I don't care if they were busy. I don't care they had to slaughter the cow in the back and bake the bread from scratch and pick the vegetables from the garden  - tips are to reward good work, not crappy, half-ass work. If it was the kitchen's fault, then TELL ME. If you're a friggin' prejudiced pig who doesn't like to serve PEOPLE OF COLOR, then tell me. If you're having your period, then taken MIDOL and deal with it and do your job correctly!!!  My hubby was in the food service industry for 7 years and we have NEVER NOT left a tip. Tonight was the first night. He said, \"Even when I have a bad day I would never treat a customer like that.\" I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and if I every treated a customer like that, I would have been written up and severely punished for bad service. 

Sunset Station, your commercial is false advertising - if you love locals, then your waitress Marlene sure doesn't. You've lost my business for now and I'll be sure to tell everyone else I come across - check your staff. If she doesn't want her job, hire someone else. 

By the way, the manager on duty conveniently checked up on everybody's meal except for me. Maybe she knew they screwed up in the kitchen and was too embarrassed to admit they they were busy and their staff isn't trained to handle a crowd. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"We wanted an inexpensive informal meal after seeing a movie downstairs. We tried the Elephant Bar across the street but that was a 40 minute wait. So we went upstairs to the Grand Cafe inside the casino. There were 4 people on line in front of us and that made me really worried about the wait for a table. To my delightful surprise in under 5 minutes we were seated. Within 2 minutes after sitting down our server came by to tell us he was busy with two other tables but would be with us as fast as possible. He was a man of his word. In under a couple of minutes he returned to get our drink order. We didn't feel like anything fancy so we ordered a Southwest salad to share and then a Reuben sandwich to share. The Southwest salad was very good. It had lots of very fresh lettuce, an ample amount of avocado, some corn, chopped tomato, and other veggies. We had the dressing on the side. It was a chipotle dressing that was absolutely delicious. Next came the Reuben sandwich with sweet potato fries. This was huge and perfectly done. Clearly not for someone counting calories. But I guess that's what made it so tasty. Sweet potato fries ordered done crispy. And they came crispy. They came with two separate dipping sauces. One was ketchup and the other ranch dressing. Fortunately we saved the dressing from the salad. It made an ideal dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries. Overall an excellent dining experience for an informal inexpensive meal. The only real negative to the meal was the fact that some cigarette smoke from the casino drifted in. I would recommend asking for a table as far away from the casino floor as possible."}
{"text":"Went to Sunset Stations Cafe at 445am. Waited 10 minutes at the host stand no staff around other than Security assisting a customer. There were two customers in the cafe but no Cafe staff. Later a host pops out from the back. Waited 5 more minutes as she goes in the back. Three others servers pops out from the back and all are looking for a missing item. We are now seated and again waiting for out server for another 5 minutes. Security tells server and host we are waiting for service and no one comes over. After servers more minutes I walk up to the group, a server sees me coming and he walks up, as I told him we are out of here. I brought my father who is from Hawaii to experience the food. But customer service was terrible. All staff at cafe was in the back kitchen not anticipating customers needs. Grave personnel orking at cafe needs refresher training and corrective action.what a terrible experience for my father. Shame on them."}
{"text":"Be prepared to clean your own table or eat on a dirty one. This is what we wiped from the surface of our table before being served. We notified the manager and he apologized and adjusted our bill but didn't send anyone out to clean the rest of his filthy dining room. Disgusting. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My experience was over all very pleasant! We did have to wait about a minute or 2 to be seated but we were greeted right away by the buser & he offered us beverages.  Our server Lacee was very sweet and attentive! We arrived around 1:00 a.m. for graveyard breakfast.  We ordered an omelet, chicken fried steak, and one of the graveyard specials. The food came out in a very reasonable amount of time and all of it was delicious!  Though we have been to the Santa Fe casino before this was actually our 1st time eating in the cafe. We left feeling very satisfied and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The servers took like 10 mins to say hello when I sat down. And Julie seems really angry about her job and the coupons people bring in she was going off with someone in the back about it.
Food was good and quick once we ordered"}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations in the Grand Cafe family. Unlike my last experience at the GVR location, this time around is better. Our host Ruel is great. He was very attentive and friendly. 
The food came out of the kitchen hot, fresh and exactly how we ordered it. No drama! 
If any of you would like to get good food and good service in the Grand Cafe franchise, this is the location to go to."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I have come here on previous occasions and My party and I have left content. But this morning, while having breakfast at this location, the kitchen was not on point with our orders. We ordered the Energy Omelette and it to be shared between myself and my good friend. One of the \"key\" ingredients that sold us with this dish are the Avocados. I love Avocados and when the meal came out, IT WAS MISSING! Naturally, I tell our hostess about it and she immediately remedies the situation by bringing some on a side plate. We also asked for cottage cheese on the side but Chris, the food deliverer gave us sausages patties instead. Again, we tell our hostess, Pam about this and once again, she remedies the mistake. Pam was great to us. She was attentive and caring but her teammates in the kitchen kept dropping the ball on her. She made a comment about we're killing her, we really are not trying to kill her, we just want to get exactly what we ordered and paid for. 
It was nice that they delivered the food in two separate plates because we were sharing one meal. 
I will not rule out never coming back to this location but it is not on the top list of our go-to places."}
{"text":"Have come to this Grand Cafe location for quite some years now and by far our most favorite host is Mr. Miguel. Their lunch menu special is good and delicious. 
Other than Mr. Miguel, the other host and hostesses should improve their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Graveyard server is absolutely shitty, sat for almost 15 minutes and got no service what so ever. It'd be one thing if it was busy but there was only one other table in the entire place(sitting right next to us) and he went up to them, even though they were seated way after us and still completely ignored us. Shitty ass service!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. But the service is horrible. I have been here a few times and it just doesn't get better. But it has happened with several different servers which leads me to believe it's more managements fault than the servers."}
{"text":"We enjoy Grand cafe. With all the restaurants in Henderson my wife and I probably frequent one of their stores more than any other.The staff is always professional and the management handles any problem with a smile. Minimal Wait time and excellent food at reasonable prices. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"As a local,l patronize the Sunset Station on regular occasion, but mostly to have brunch in the Grand Café which is consistently a reliable good quality of food and service. It is always well-staffed with attentive service people from the hostess to the servers and cashiers."}
{"text":"Order medium rare, the steak came out well done I mentioned it to the waitress and she called her manager and he offered 10% discount on next visit there will be  no next visit food suck."}
{"text":"This hotel is very nice. I would rate it better but the food just wasn't all that for me. It was ok not bad tasting or anything but I was expecting way more since the casino floor is so nice. If they were able to match it up with awesome food this would defiantly be my go to place. Bloody Mary's are also pretty good."}
{"text":"Not a good start for the \"new\" Grand Cafe.  Hostess seats us with no friendliness, and hands us menus that must weigh 5 or 6 pounds (why?) then its a 5 min. wait to give order.  Dirty place-setting plates.  Lets hope the food makes up for it...more later.

Ok, been over 12 minutes, still no sign of the food.  Finally, syrup & butter arrives, whoopee!  Now it's been another 6 min., food on the table, hooray.  Oh boy, biscuits & gravy ice cold, geesh!  Sent back, waitress brings new platter....exactly the same, what the hell?  Now we notice my wife's bacon.  Instead of a nice presentation of 4 slices, it's a mess of broken pieces and one whole piece.  But she's happy, likes the taste and her blueberry pancakes are good.

All in all, not a very good experience.  Waitress said she'd let manager know about cold bisc.&grvy, but he never came to the table.  The bill was at full price and no apology...very disappointing.  Very slow service from kitchen, busy day, but not overly so, thus no excuse for poor service overall.
We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is for the service. The waiter was friendly, professional and very attentive. Everyone greeted us and the Manager Jose dropped by our table to check our satisfaction. I saw Jose bus tables himself, and check on other tables. It is clear his \"leading by example\" has inspired his staff!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner to the Grand Cafe at Rancho Sante Fe Casino on Wednesday . My husband ordered the BBQ RIBS.  The ribs still had the membrane on them.  GROSS ! The waitress was surprised.  No manager even came over to talk to us. Left a comment card. No contact from anyone from F&B. Definitely crossing the restaurant off our list. Disappointed.  Lack of customer service."}
{"text":"If I have a bad expweiwnce in a place I usually give the place a second chance and that is the case with the GRand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch.
I came one rime a couple of weeks ago and service was horrible. 
2 weeks after previous experien (and different hour) I came to eat here again. Sat at the bar, bartender looked at me anf he walked away....no menu, no drink, not even a \"Hi\". I waited for 10 more minutes when he finally came out and look at me again.....and nothing. He went back to the back. 
I went to the hostess and asked for a table.... I was seated quickly but my waiter was MIA for 10 minutes... I ordered my meal .and he got it conpletly wrong. Also he served he cold coffe and the water I asked at the beggining of my meal i got it when I was signing the check.
I dont know what is going on with this place but the service ia horrible. It seems like the pwoplw who work here at very unhappy or they just dont care.
My advice......eat here only if you have an hour to kill otherwise move along.
Food still decent."}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed in food and service as a whole. Took my nephew here for breakfast for his 10th birthday. The plan was to get breakfast before seeing a movie. We sat down ordered breakfast, we ordered both the biscuits and gravy skillet with eggs cooked over medium after waiting 35 minutes for our breakfast, food came out subpar, eggs were so over cooked, we couldn't even eat it, biscuits were hard as rocks and gravy was watery. Definitely disappointed in food and service, the server was running around I felt bad for her, the manager never made her way over to talk about the food situation she only came by about 30 mins after I started to ask about our food she said that the food was coming shortly. My nephew and I left after not eating our food and after waiting 45 minutes and missing our movie. Thankfully the girl at the movie theater gave us tickets for the next show time. Really disappointed in today's visit"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner b/c we arrived at the hotel late and we were too lazy to go anywhere else. We had originally picked Oyster Bar but the line was crazy long for only 10 seats and we didn't feel like standing in line for 1+ hours. 

Prime rib dinner - For $11.99, this was a darn good deal. Giant piece of beef, with your choice of baked or mashed potatoes, and some veggies on the side. The beef was tender and edible and hey, that's the most you can ask for at that price.

Reuben sandwich - Holy moly this sandwich was greasy!  It literally dripped grease the entire time. Grease aside, I wish they sliced the pastrami thinner as there were definitely pieces that needed to be cut with a knife and not with bare teeth. Still, it was tasty.

Overall, the Grand Cafe is a nice clean place if you happen to find yourself as the Palace Station hotel and you're looking for a quick place for dinner."}
{"text":"Giving it four stars because this was my first time trying anything at this cafe and it tasted pretty good...Will update review once I've had a chance to try other things and try it again for consistency...We were on our way home when I felt really hungry all of a sudden...So I thought why not go to Sunset Casino's Grand Cafe and try one of their specials...They have a 1/2 lb burger and fries for less than $5 and that my friends is right up my alley...If I hated it...At least I didn't spend much...I was with two other family members and we orderd two burgers and fries deal and one order of a short stack of pancakes...The pancakes cost no more than $4 and were two huge nice and thick pancakes...It was almost like buying four pancakes I was impressed to say the least..The burgers were two of the biggest burgers I've seen in a long time and they were piping hot...Just like I like!! I normally will not buy a burger because everytime I get it..It's cold and I hate cold burgers!..This one was just right..Had lettuce, tomatoes and two large slices of pickle...Which I almost removed but glad I didn't..The burgers were perfect... ( Cheese was a $1 more..Which we skipped ) To my surprised the burger tasted like it had cheese..Lol...The fries on the other hand need to be replaced with thicker fries..They get hard if you don't eat them fast enough...So mine ended up in the trash...All in all..I would definitely recommend Grand Cafe to a friend or family member...Will update this review once I try them again and I hope they add more $5 meals.*"}
{"text":"We go there to eat cause the food is really good but the service in getting seated is just terrible.   You wait in line & they stand behind the desk talking"}
{"text":"This is the 24/7 restaurant inside Sunset Station. For what it is, it's a-ok. Their menu offerings are actually quite plentiful. The portions are large. The prices are decent. And everything we had tasted good. Service was friendly and attentive enough. There's not much more you can ask for, especially in the middle of the night. Tip: The prime rib benedict was particularly tasty."}
{"text":"After an hour or so of tossing and turning one early morning, I found myself becoming increasing frustrated which then further perpetuated my inability to fall into a carefree slumber.  I roused myself out of bed and began to search for a spot to eat.  I had decided on grabbing a quick bite at Fat Burger Green Valley that says it was open 24/7 only to find it closed.  After wondering around GVR, I finally set on dining at Grand Café.  

Much of what can be said about Grand Café has already been said - but I will add that I was not disappointed with my meal.  I got the T-bone steak special with fully loaded mashed potatoes and veggies.  In the traditional early morning hotel/casino café manner, there were very few staff on hand, but with that understanding factored into my expectations, my meal was served in a decent amount of time in a decent manner.  It was a decent meal served at a time when no one in their decent mind would be awake on a weekday - unless one was on the strip.  In which case, they would probably still have a decent meal but pay three times for more it."}
{"text":"Super, super bad service! Server was very slow and kitchen staff was not able to handle a mini rush.
The only saving grace was that the manager seemed very sorry that the service was not good.
If you are short on time or very hungry do not come here, oh and you might bring your own drink since it took 20 min to get a glass of water that the manager had to bring because the server was Mia ..."}
{"text":"Don't even try going there pst 10:30 pm. The service is horrible. I sat at the counter for 15 minutes with hardly anyone in the restraint on aug. 31, 2016, and no service. Instead, I went to the professionals at dumb burger king."}
{"text":"came here because there was a sign outside that said Prime Rib special...

arrived at 11pm on Sat... no special going on

ordered a  t-bone special - fresh and smoky grill
asked for medium rare but got rare... too tired/late to complain
$10 comes with veggies and asked for mash potatos

turkey sandwich was blah... don't like turkey deli meat"}
{"text":"Nice place inside the Green Valley Ranch and Spa. It's one of the few places that doesn't overcharge you to death for food that is actually pretty good. 

When my friend and I went in the place was relatively empty so the service was pretty quick. The server was nice and did everything perfectly...at first. 

I ordered the southwest chicken salad with no chicken. I don't understand salad prices staying the same when you take off the most important ingredient (and most expensive), but oh well. 

The salad was big and had really fresh avocado slices that melted in my mouth. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes and corn, etc. were just delicious. The tortilla strips were small and in short supply, but I probably didn't need those anyway.

My friend had the chinese chicken salad and said it was really good. It looked just as fresh and was just as big as mine. Yummy!

My glass was always filled and the waiter checked on us for the most part until he started getting more customers then we sort of fell to the wayside, but it's okay, we really enjoyed our lunch here. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for first time with my son. Prices are good. Service was fast! The desserts are so good!!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast Specials and service.  When you go ask for Greg to serve you.  This place makes you feel like a V.I.P.  The breakfast is perfectly cooked.  I've been a Chef for 30 years so I can speak on this topic.  It's hard to find a good egg man, but they have one here.  The hash browns are everything you could ever want.  A generous portion cooked just right.  Got to talk to Management on this visit and I'm impressed!!!  Don't miss this place, the prices are right and great breakfast.  Not sure about the rest of the menu because I just can't stray from the breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Good deals totally worth the money on breakfast special 6.99 for 3  eggs 3 sausage, 3 bacon, hash browns, 1 biscuit and gravy and it includes your drink. Service is great most of the time only reason it's not 5 stars in my book. Totally worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This is a negative star review! This place sucks.  Literally waited in line last week at the Grand Cafe for over 20 minutes ( this while they had to \"go find\" a busser for all the empty tables!  A customer on his way out passed by and said \" in 57 years I've never had this bad of service! I had to wait 45 minutes for a hamburger!\"  We thought he may be exaggerating a little so we still waited until they finally say us.  Then once sat we were told that it yep it's 45 minutes for ANYTHING.  I ordered an omelette lol and that would still take 45 min.  The waitress actually said this with a smile on her face!  After approximately 35 minutes we got our food and it was just meh. Please avoid at all costs unless you have nothing else to do wit your day."}
{"text":"Always count on the best service here! Ask for Diane, Lorenzo, and Charlotte to get all just right. They are true professionals, and I am happy that I can get them when we come!

I enjoy the Chinese dishes and breakfast here!"}
{"text":"The first thing I have to say is that THEY ARE SO SO VERY SLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Second thing is THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!

I was hoping for a good fulfilling meal at the Green Valley Ranch Resort Buffet but the line was too long and I was with tired parents, brother, his wife and their two hungry and sleepy kids so we decided to just go to this place which was across from the buffet and had no line. 

Despite the fact that there were many empty tables, we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. After that we pretty much quickly ordered but that didn't make a difference because we still waited about an hour and half for our food to come out - took about 30 minutes for the starter soup and salads to come out...when I say they are slow - they were really really slow......we could have line up at the buffet line and be done with dinner before they even started serving us food. The thing is it wasn't even busy - at all - so I don't understand why it took them that long.

The waiter was apologetic but he is never to be found either.

The food was not even mediocre - both my dish (the Meatloaf with Mashed potato) and my sister-in-law's Fried Chicken Steak was very over salted. I literally was barely able to eat the meatloaf - if it wasn't for the bland mashed potatoes that kind of neutralized the saltiness of the meat. My mom's Grilled Fish was really dry and my dad's Fish and Chips was over fried. My brother's Deli sandwich - looked like the 5 dollar convenience store sandwich and it was only half a sandwich not a full one. The only kind of decent dish was my older brother's rib eye - but even then it was kind of chewy. 

Overall I would not come to this place even if I was starving - because I would have had to wait forever for over-salted, dry and nearly inedible food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some breakfast on our way to check out of the resort. 

Hubby ordered the cinnamon swirl pancake and a side of biscuits and gravy. He enjoyed the pancake but the biscuit and gravy came out cold. 

I had the buckwheat pancakes which come with blueberries and a blueberry syrup. Thank god for the blueberry because the buckwheat pancakes are unfortunately very forgettable. The flavor was just not there. On the other hand, the \"Morning Mary\" has to be one of the best breakfast cocktails I've ever had.

Spicy, salty and pleasantly chilled. Just delicious and I wish I knew what mix they used. The coffee was also good."}
{"text":"This had to have been the worst service l have ever had in Las Vegas! I was seated, without a menu, it was 20 minutes before the server even approached me to give me one. He asked me if l would like something to drink, l told him, l would like an ice tea, no lemon extra ice. 20 minutes later, still no drink and hasn't returned to take my order. That is when a woman who appeared to be the restaurant manager was making the rounds asked if there was anything that l needed? I explained that I had been there 40 minutes and the server hadn't even taken my order, had taken my beverage order and never came back! She took my order and then he served it! For the first time in my life I wrote on the gratuity line ZERO! I could understand if the place was jumping, but there were only 3 tables, with maybe two or three people sitting at them! I don't tip for horrible service!"}
{"text":"Horrible service for midnight shifts. I've had two different service servers when I come and they both have horrible customer service. I come for the specials all the time and the servers look like they don't want to be here...."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  We saw their online menu and came here to try it out. We added avocado to the burger and was charged $2 when on their website it says $1, so we pointed out the difference to the waitress. We just wanted to know why the difference?  Instead of apologizing that they didn't update THEIR website or whatever the reason is for the difference (which we would have accepted it), we were told that they will take a dollar off our bill this time but they needed us to know that this will not be the case next time.  Unbelievable! They false advertised, didn't apologize, and we got lectured!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. More like 2.5 stars, which is disappointing in a 4 star casino. We ate lunch here on a Sunday, and it took about 20 minutes just to get seated, and it didn't seem very full. The service was okay. The Cobb salad was too bland, and the Chinese chicken salad tasted good but the parsley was wilted and some of the greens were so old they were brown or disintegrating. Bleah!  The turkey club sandwich looked better than it tasted, with dry and tasteless turkey. The best things were the beef barley soup and gigantic banana split sundae. The food reminded me of theme park food, which doesn't have to be great since you are a captive audience so to speak. If we went to the casino again we'd likely eat there for convenience, but won't expect much. Hopefully we'd win so much money we wouldn't care!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. We were headed to the buffet but it was closing at that time so we were left with this place. I'd NEVER eat here again. First off it took 20 mins for someone to come up to us and ask us what we wanted to drink. Not to mention the seat on our booth was filthy and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Waiters kept walking past our table and weren't even acknowledging us and there was maybe only 4 other tables full. My sister and I order a Philly cheesesteak and my mom ordered the cheeseburger special. While we were eating my mom found something hard in her cheeseburger!!!!!! Which turned her off from eating it so she went home hungry. As for my Philly cheesesteak, it was disgusting. The meat was so oily it coated the back of my throat and all I could taste was the oil. It had not been strained AT ALL. It also had 0 flavor. It tasted like I was eating oily cardboard. All three of us left hungry that night and payed way too much for that. I also had an upset stomach from all the oil for the rest of the day. Dissatisfied and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I actually ate first in July following a surgery. Then after a couple of more surgeries in August. These folks accommodated my dietary restrictions and were so welcoming and friendly.

Of course DOC was the Keno Runner. Great guy! 

Then this Christmas we stayed again and were treated like the Royalty we have always pretended to be. The Suis Chef, Jennifer, came and visited us, Paige Elizabeth (also our granddaughter's name) waited on us on the morning, and Daune waited on us in the very, very early morning. These folks are wonderful ambassadors for the Grand Cafe. Oh! Don't forget Freddy, who supported these others like a great director of the theatre.

I'll will be back many times. In fact, today!

The food is good cafe faire, the service is great, the atmosphere welcoming."}
{"text":"Ok I gotta say I was getting ready to head out the door when Ramon showed up as my server and wow he was great ! I give four stars because the food was good and when I really did get a server he was GREAT!"}
{"text":"This is great cafe when nobodys in, when busy. The under staff can't handle the load. Thats where the Guest Service gets tossed out the window with the Lazy Management. 

Had to send Glass of Water back 3 times and still had crapp floating in it. If the water glass never get washed, what else is being missed."}
{"text":"12am-6am late night deals are the best with a boarding pass. I had the chicken fried steak for 4.99!! Huge freakin serving and the waitress was super funny."}
{"text":"my husband and I are becoming regulars here. it's right up the street from my work and it's always open. it's perfect for when I get off work at 11pm. I haven't taken any pics yet but I will next time we go. I like the grilled sour dough turkey sandwhich, it's very similar to the super bird at Dennys except it's way yayyyyyyyyy fatter. and I usually add a side salad with ranch, my husband gets steak or prime rib, it's always been great so far and you cannot get the price, especially if you have a players card and use your points. we have yet to have a bad experience here. our server Donna who we have had twice now is awesome, she very attentive and friendly and informative and welcoming. and she remembered that I am obsessed with ranch lol. I enjoy the grand cafe, more than the buffet or the Mexican food place at boulder. it's affordable, it's good, good service and it's always open. I can't wait til we go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes 9.49
Served with fresh vegetables and COUNTRY GRAVY...

Ok this is what I ordered, pretty simple order huh.

OH we also ordered a salad at extra cost and to me is was not worth it. I am not a fan of wilted greens mixed in with a few fresh leaves.

Our salads took a little too long to get to us and of course the entree arrived about two minutes later. Look I know this is a casino coffee shop but even they should teach one how to pace ones self in serving.

Now back to the chicken plate. I got two breasts and nothing more, I suspect a lot of folks would be thrilled with this but not me. I dislike breasts and only order fried chicken knowing you usually get some of the dark meat as well. The description says nothing about the offering and if it did I would have opted for something other. But it does say it comes with gravy and of course my potatoes came bare with no offering of gravy or butter. I had to ask for it and that burns my ass since the cook missed it the waitress should have noticed an incomplete plate. And god the veggies were so uninspired; just some stuff sitting on the plate and slightly warm. I know since I have made veggies to be served to the masses and actually made them desirable, it can be done.

This meal truly bugged me, where is my bug spray.

This place is located in the Sunset Station hotel and casino of which I like and we stay here often while driving between Reno and Phoenix."}
{"text":"We wanted to go to the buffet but the line was really long so we tried the cafe instead. Since it was empty that should have been enough of a warning. The food was just average in my opinion. I got a club sandwich with fries and it was nothing special. I got just a water and the glass looked dirty. My fiance ordered the bottomless Bloody Marys and he said they were just okay and he wouldn't order it again. Service was good but everything else was just underwelming. I did like that the slots next to the restaurant were NON Smoking. I thought that was a great choice on their part. We probably won't be back to the cafe."}
{"text":"In all honestly if I could put 0 stars that would be my option. It just upsets me that this is close to home so it's really the only option I have when it comes to a late night quick option. 

See its a hit or miss sometimes mostly a MISS!! We where a party of 7. We waited about 5-10 minutes for our table to be set up and upon our arrival to the back section I checked in on Yelp. About 29 mins later after approaching a bus person a server finally decides to bring us our waters. YES! 29 minutes after she lays down the waters some of us order additional drinks, at this time I informed her about my concern on the time of service and that I hope we are compensated for the wait. She ensures me that she will let her manager know and puts blame on the hostess for seating us when she has so many other tables to wait on. 

When our drinks arrived we placed our orders now this is about 45 minutes already of not having an order placed. As she slowly starts bringing in our appetizers she offers one while we wait, we take her offer. About 55 mins to an hour later of receiving our appetizers our meals arrive. None of of ordered anything extravagant enough to take about a hour to serve. Without complaint we eat as fast as we can because we are already 2 hours into this meal. Without finishing much of our meals we take the rest to go. 

She asked if we would like split checks and walk away. Never did she ask how we wanted them split since 4 out of the 7 are couples she splits each one individually. When we get to the register to check out we notice that our bills weren't compensated not even a 10% discount for the extreme level of inconvenience they caused. She informed me that we received a complimentary appetizer an appetizer worth of $10 with a bill of about $100 and over 2 hours of wait time, we get a complimentary appetizer well they really shouldn't have even offered that! 

As I approach the manager with our concerns she was quick to snap at me about how they where busy and started making excuses. First off as a manager do you give your guest an excuse that you where provided a lack in service because they where busy? As she continued to argue with me she gave in an gave us 10% off each check which was about $1-2 off for each individual. The LACK of hospitality and customer satisfaction is beyond unreal! 

Who ever the general manager of food and beverage is for GVR needs to take time to re evaluate the staff in this cafe. It's beyond unacceptable to go through what we did as customers."}
{"text":"Meh.  45 minute wait for our party of 5 (Matthew Fox and Scott Wolf not included).  Long wait again for our order to get taken.  Bonus: fresh hot sourdough bread brought to the table.  

Of our party of 5, four entrees had problems.  Blah!  Eventually everyone got their correct food (two items had to be entirely remade), and it was decent food.  

Our server didn't offer anything to make up for the hassles - a free dessert for the table would've done a lot to make us happy.  I talked to the manager before we left and he ended up taking off some of the entrees, which was a very generous gesture.  

We'd definitely give it another try - their dessert case look incredible."}
{"text":"I really can't give a review of the food here because all I had was yogurt with granola and a cup of coffee but the staff is fantastic. In my 20 minute time here, four staff members greeted me (a host, a waitress bringing me coffee, one taking my order and a man from the kitchen with my yogurt) each of whom were incredibly nice. 
I just moved to Vegas from a small town in California and I have been appalled at the way some people act here and I was delighted to have this experience with the staff here."}
{"text":"Our experiences here were quite interesting..

The food was extremely mediocre, very greasy, but the portions were good sized. The server was nice, but very slow to take our order, bring utensils, food & drinks. Someone at our table asked for a salad with ranch dressing, and the server brought a salad that was swimming in ranch, that was dripping all over the floor & table! Then the next day, he asked for jelly for toast... They weren't the little packets you usually get.. It looked like someone went into their fridge & scooped a spoonful of jam into a mini serving cup.. Spoon shaped & all!

My stomach is sensitive & didn't feel that great after eating here. Beware!"}
{"text":"The grand cafe food is wonderful - the service is very poor.  We waited in line longer to give them our money than we did sitting and eating our food!  I wish we could give you folks four stars, but service is a great deal apart of eating!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the prime rib medium, came out bloody red and cold, green beans ice cold, baked potato warm. Concerned that the food here is not being stored at the correct temps.

Wife and mother-in law had to send theirs back for same reasons, took 10 minutes longer to get the food back out. Good taste, just don't want to get ill."}
{"text":"Was lured into this place by the $10.00 t-bone dinner. Called ahead to see if they were still open and if they still had the special. The person on the phone said the special was still available. Upon ordering, the waiter said they had ran out of the special and I asked if they'd substitute another thing, like prime rib for the same price. They said it wasn't possible, so i asked if they could talk to management. He said management wasn't around, but we could try again later. We order the prime rib, then ask if management had an answer. Waiter said management could do nothing to substitute the prime rib, even when we tried to explain how we called ahead, offering to show the waiter our call log. It's unfortunate that in such a hospitable place as the Green Valley Ranch Resort that management could not accommodate us. Such a shame considering everything else about this resort has been absolute perfection. The dinner was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Aww we this is my fav station hotel to come too for breakfast I got myself the ham steak special an you can never go wrong an my fiancé got the French toast platter"}
{"text":"I got the turkey club. It was very dry and had almost no mayonnaise on it, little bacon, and the turkey was dry. I had to dip it in mustard to be able to eat it. Although the fries were excellent. Then I took a bite of the coleslaw. I had to spit it out, it was rotten. My wife had the quesadilla. she liked it. The waitress had 7 tables when we got there. It took 3 keno games before she asked us what we want to drink, then another 4 games to take our order. It seemed to take for ever to get the food. The table next to use sent their prime rib back because it over done. We had a $20 coupon so we tried this place. I must say, there are too many great places around here to bother with this place."}
{"text":"What a nasty breakfast! Ordered the Spinach and Tomato Benedict with a side of bacon, coffee and water. 

The server was prompt and efficient.

The coffee and water were great. 

I'm accustomed to Benedict eggs being poached..today's eggs were more like hard boiled..yuk! 
The spinach must've been blanched as it was stringy and chewy..yuk. 
The plate came with hash brown potatoes that were also overcooked, super crispy and just unappetizing to look at...much like the four (generous!) pieces of brittle bacon. 

Seriously, the worse breakfast I've ever had..what a disappointment especially for a casino property! 

Nasty!"}
{"text":"Food and service was GREAT! (Eric, you are an AMAZING server! Yet when we noticed that we were over-charged and management was brought into the situation, they were extremely rude! He said it was not their problem and for us to just pay the bill.......NOT going back just because of the MANAGER! Sent a letter to the corporate office, will update IF I get a responce..."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Service is pretty good!! Depending on how busy they are the wait for our food can take awhile, but usually it's fairly decent. We never wait to be seated. Pastries are amazing!!! I really don't have any complaints. We love coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Food is usually delicious! It seems to be going down lately. I had the teriyaki bowl and it seemed like they just threw some soy sauce on top of some grilled chicken, rice, and then put some random veggies leftover in there. The chicken tastes good though. Service is friendly but they seem pretty short staffed, and sometimes they aren't friendly. The manager seems rude and a little condescending. Their desserts are good but I swear I saw them all jump up by $2 since the last time I checked a few weeks ago. We prefer Sunset Stations's cafe over this one. They need to get it together..."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service.  The place is almost empty and our food has taken over an hour to come to the table...  I can not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very friendly, fast service. Nachos were delicious, as was the Philly cheese steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Average at best. Ordered the eggs benny. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hash browns were nice and crispy, but the English muffins tasted kind of stale. It would have been nice if the waitstaff smiled. Every single employee there seemed like they hated their life. A friendlier experience with the employees would have increased the rating. Not a fan of grumpy people."}
{"text":"Fairly slow, however cheap food for those looking for a place to eat 24 hours around the clock while gambling at the Green Valley Ranch Resort.  Breakfast is served 24 hours, and the best deal will be the NY Steak and Eggs.  Can't really go wrong w/ that as the steak is actually a generous cut and cooked fairly well for a 'cafe'.

The decor is very average and you get more of the feel of an old school Denny's that isn't run down.  The service isn't exactly quick, so don't expect to get out of there fast if you're in a hurry.  They did mix our drinks up w/ another's table, but we let it slide since we were in a good mood.  There are better places to eat here if you're staying or visiting this resort."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a Station Café after a couple of hours at the Tables or at the Buffalo slots!  There is usually never a wait to be seated, which is always a plus when you're starving because you lost track of time after that last slot bonus round!  Today the food took unusually longer so I dont know if they had a new Chef back there, but it took for-e-ver.  They have good dinner and lunch specials and my mom raves about their Senior dinner prices and all the fun things she can order so she doesnt have to cook after work.  

You can get your standard salads, sandwiches, entrees like Chicken Fried Steak or Grilled Salmon with Green Beans. Their all day breakfast menu is deelish and their belgian waffles with strawberrries are my absolute favorite!  

One thing I would do is stay away from are all those desserts in the cold box that look so deelish, I visited here a couple of days in a row and you can tell they are prepared, stored in a fridge and kept in the dessert case for a number of days.  What a let down!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, maybe a step up from dennys with a nice selection. I do have to give props for the service though. The server was excellent and the manager, who I overheard talking to the couple in the booth next to us, was bending over backwards to make them happy so the place really seems to want to make their customers happy. So in a nutshell ok food with good service at decent prices. Can't recommend but I might give them a second shot."}
{"text":"This is a decent Cafe inside Green Valley Ranch Casino. I came here for Breakfast and was pleasantly surprised with the variety of gourmet options. I created my own omelette with a side of hash browns and toast. Everything tasted delicious!  My only complaint would be that the service was a bit slow. I still enjoyed the whole experience and will definitely try their lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that it is in the Green Valley Ranch casino.  That being said, it has a pretty good selection of things from a fairly generic menu.  I've ordered at least a dozen things from the menu over the last few years of going there and have never really been disappointed or delighted...just a big solid \"OK\".  I'd never go out of my way to eat here, but if you happen to be in the casino already and just want a quick bite...it works."}
{"text":"Located in Boulder Station is this average casino cafe.  It seems all the Station Casino has a Grand Cafe in it.  There is nothing special about them, just your standard cafe serving average food.  But they are opened 24/7, the prices are cheap and the meals are good but not great.  Service here need some improvement.  After we were seated, nobody came to our tables.  After a long wait, I complained to the management who rationalized that they were busy.  They weren't.  When we tried to pay, the women at the register was irritated that we walked to the wrong register and spent over 15 minutes with the customer in front me.  Management just watched and didn't help.  The food was good, but they clearly need additional help or training."}
{"text":"I came the restaurant I asked for medium rare steak. I asked the waitress(Bernadine) that the steak was rare not medium rare. Then she took the plate n came back saying that the steak was medium. I told her no it wasnt. Then I show her the pic of the different kind of  meat is cooked. Then she still saying that it was medium rare. Then few min later she came back with a steak well done. This place use to be better now it sucks. I'm never coming back due the food and the waitress . 

L"}
{"text":"This place can be wonderful or a disappointment depending on how well-staffed it is when you go there. Late night specials are outrageously low priced like the \"old Las Vegas\" Maxim Cafe, now long gone.  The T-bone special can be great or just okay..the daily specials are a great deal..."}
{"text":"Not sure why the low reviews but I enjoyed my first time dining here. I have been to most of the eating areas at sunset station but have yet to check out the cafe'. One fateful day my mom suggested we try it when we met up for brunch. There was no wait, to be seated we were told instantly about the specials menu as long as you have a station players card which is free to obtain. Any who we opted for the 2 different breakfast specials that include; bacon, eggs, and pancakes. Each special was under $5 which is always good on the ole wallet. Our server was very nice and made the rounds quickly. Another positive attribute about the specials menu is that you can snag any of them 24/7. Wish they could add a few more things to the players club menu selection, but can't beat the price. We were both able to grab some good breakfast & 2 drinks for $12 not too shabby."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot chocolate tasted watered down no service everyone is rude I will never go back here we waited 30 mins before we even got seen. And the only lady that did come to my table only came to pick up a tip from the last customers and then left without even asking if we've been helped yet. I can't believe how bad the service is for an establishment like this people looked at us and turned away to go to the back to hold personal conversations."}
{"text":"The food, service, hours, price- all perfect. Donna was our server and she was on top of it. Also, such a sweet women- definitely has the southern hospitality kind of personality and service. I had a turkey and bacon sandwhich and my boyfriend had a burger- no complaints from either of us. Great for a late night snack after a night on the town!"}
{"text":"Wow waited 8 minutes for someone to get us a drink. I had to holler the hostess who was a total snot! Awful awful I'm not even going to finish the rest of the dining experience because it was so awful. GVR you have lost yourself a good player!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly decently good service and food for 1am. The waitress was super friendly and the food came out in roughly 15 minutes. I ordered The Cafe Surf & Turf which was great, came with green beans and I opted for French Fries."}
{"text":"My friend ordered chicken farfalle it was dry and hard as a rock.  As usual the service sucks I always wait from 45 mins to an hour before I get my food.  But Paula our server is so accommodating."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place received 3 stars!  It is absolutely terrible!  I ordered the chicken fried steak dinner at out servers suggestion.....and it was disgusting!  I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife!  I am not kidding!  I don't know what kind of so called \"meat\" it was....but it was clearly not edible!  My husband ordered a plain burger...which the server also suggested....and the bun was as hard as a hockey puck!  You couldn't even touch the plate it was on because it was so hot!  Obviously been sitting under heat lamp in kitchen for a long time!  I sent my chicken fried steak back...and ordered the prime rib dip, thinking it would be out quickly and how could they screw up putting some meat on a roll.  The server finally brings it to me and it is like something I've never seen before!  It had cold cheese all over it loaded with onions in/on it!!!  The so called prime rib was grayish brown in color and looked like it was made a week ago!  So again I called the server to the table....and asked her what this was supposed to be....she said..\"this is how we make them here!\"  And then she said \"Oh by the way....we've had a lot of complaints about the chicken fried steak....so there must be a problem with the vendor.\"  I said...\"it looks to me like there's more problems with this place than your vendor!\"  This $10.29 prime rib dip was a disgusting joke!  I seriously wouldn't have given it to my dog!  The waitress said she tried to talk to the cooks....but had a very hard time communicating with them....due to their inability to speak English!!!!!!  She went on to say that she believed most of them were illegals!!!!  I was dumb-founded!!!!!  
So I guess the moral to this story is....when you eat at an establishment that hires illegals....that can't speak ENGLISH....and that don't give a crap about what they are preparing.....you end up with disgusting slop!!!  And god knows what else you might end up with!!!!  This place doesn't even deserve one star!!!  They deserve a visit from the Health Dept. and Immigration!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this casino opened!  This Cafe has consistantly gone DOWN HILL RAPIDLY!  Many years ago it was really good & management was professional and actually had standards.  Nothing else was open but Fat Burger on Tuesday (5-12) around 11pm.  So we made the mistake of eating at this cafe.  So many things were wrong...ugh!  Place was dead....only 2 or 3 people eating.  We waited for 15 minutes to get seated while a server walked up to us and tossed some menus on the hostess counter and walked away.  While the cashier stood there waiting for someone to pay there bill.  Two other servers stood at end of bar with some guy in a suit who tried to appear to be a manager I guess.  Anyway....we decided to grab a couple menus and seat ourselves.  We sat at a booth near the other people that were eating and the server yells! \"Can I help you?\"  While she stood at the end of the bar. I replied \"Apparently we have to help ourselves!\"  And from here it was a complete and utter disaster!  Our sever was so rude that I seriously considered smackin her!  We ordered chicken fried steak dinner and fish & chips that the server claimed was amazing!  OMG what a joke!  The CFS was so burnt that you could lift it from your plate....drop it....and it literally shattered into pieces!!!!!!!!  The potatos were old and cold.....and the green beans were disgusting!!!!  You couldn't even eat it!  Now lets get to the pathetic fish & chips.  This clueless guy brings it out in a basket with 3 pieces of cold greasey fish with soggy thick coating that you could squeeze and watch the oil pour from it!!!!!!  Fries....cold!!!!!  They never brought us ketchup, tarter sauce or lemon!!!!  Which we asked for immediately when the guy brought it out.  Well he never came back.  So after 10 minutes we saw our so-called server.....and asked her for it.....she said \"I'm not the food runner!\"  I just about snatched her up by her neck!!!!!  No Joke!!!!!  At this point it didn't even matter anymore.  None of the food we ordered was even edible.  Our receipt said the servers name was RAMMIEN.  But I don't know if that was the clueless guy that brought the inedible food out or the clueless broad that took our order and almost got her teeth knocked out! Either way....this place completely sucks!  $32.04 down the drain!  That so called manager that was there in the suit that stood around speaking spanish to everyone should be fired!  Along with the staff and cooks!  I would never ever go here again even if it were free!!!!  I'm surprised the food & beverage managers allow this kind of service to continue at Green Valley Ranch.  I can tell you that Tide's is very good.  But this cafe should be shut down ASAP!  They have ZERO STANDARDS!!!!"}
{"text":"I HAVE WALKED OUT OF THIS PLACE 3 TIMES now and won't be back. I had no choice but to walk out because the wait staff purposely ignore customers in this joint. There are 10 of them milling around walking past you but they never serve you. You walk in, get seated, and then get intentionally ignored by pathic waiters who do not want to work.

Don't bother eat here you will not be served. The food is overpriced Applebees anyway. I did eat here one time and the food was UNEDIBLE!!! The meatballs were rock hard. It was absolutely disgusting. No human being could eat such garbage."}
{"text":"I am updating my review of this cafe as both food quality and service have gone down.  I ordered the fish and chips.  It has been my experience that fish and chips here is usually not spectacular but it is better than warming up some fish sticks at home.  I am usually ok with that for the sake of convenience and having an excuse to go out.

When I got my food, it looked great! Crisp on the outside and I was ready to dig in.  I was so disappointed when I cut into the fish and the batter was still raw on the inside.  They overbreaded the fish and as a result, the batter did not cook all the way through.  I tried to salvage what I could and ate my french fries.  I'm not one to send food back, but it would have been nice if the server had asked, \"Hey, I notice you took the breading off the fish, everything ok?\" Little things like that really make a difference in the experience of customers."}
{"text":"Love to eat here late at night. Always a friendly bartender and quick service. My father had breakfast and finished every bite and i had a great cheeseburger. For the price as well.... Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Had a light breakfast here with my wife and the food took a long time to come out with only 6 other tables with guests at them. I had to fold up a napkin for under one of the table supports because the table was so wobbly. We had eggs Benedict and saw about 4 other tables served who came in after us. Basically it took a little while to get our food."}
{"text":"It's what you would expect of a 24 hour diner in a casino. Cheap and it'll get you by for late night munchies or last resort place. I will say it was so much better than the Feast Buffet which was horrible. The cafe service was good and the prices were great. Just don't expect perfection!"}
{"text":"Love the place, been there many times. Went this time for the buy one get one free coupon and found they were a little unsure how to process it. Waitress wouldn't scan my card for the discounts on wings and shrimp cocktail said front does it ( never how it used to be and I still don't think is). Checking out took almost 8 minutes because of the coupon and she screwed everything up in the process. 

Food was great and the experience other than that was wonderful. Keep in mind though their wings are tasty but a little too salty!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop inside sunset station, have you seen their dessert case? It's to DIE for -- lots and lots of donuts, cakes and pies ........WOW :) we ate here twice for breakfast when my close GF came to town. They are friendly, price is fair and the food is good. The only bummer is when my GF paid and they somehow didn't return my GF's credit card. We got all the way downtown to shop and had to call and yes, the waitress still had her credit card :( well maybe we left to quickly I don't know. We headed back to Sunset Station and security had her card, whew! :) will eat here again, and again."}
{"text":"The sad part is............complaints don't accomplish anything.  The management continues to make the same mistakes in judgment or they simply don't give a damn while they act like they are sympathetic.........How pathetic"}
{"text":"The wait staff here is so friendly the couple of times I have been here. This is basically their coffee shop. It's a 24 hour diner offering American food. I find their food always fresh, so far - and tasty. Wish they had an open-faced turkey sandwich on the menu and the waitress told me if I could describe it to her, she is sure the cook would make it for me hahahaa I opted out and went with the chicken fried steak which did the job. Nothing special, but did the job. I will be back because they are open 24 hours and by my house!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats! 
24/7 they have
$3 all you can eat pancakes
$4 bacon cheeseburger with fries

If you want a late night deal (midnight-6am)
$2 short stack pancakes
$2 skillet (hash browns, eggs, toast) 
$3 cheeseburger and fries

My one complaint is slow service, I sat for a while hoping my water would be refilled. But I can't complain for an entire breakfast for $4 after midnight. My tip was as big as my bill!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had in Vegas.
We went to the Cafe because the buffet had too long of a line, thinking that we'd be able to get in and out faster. We probably should have spent the hour waiting in the buffet line. We were seated around 7:15pm, it took 10 minutes before someone took our drinks order, another 5 for the food order, and probably 45 minutes before we actually received our food. Two of the plates shows obvious evidence of having been under the heat lamp for a significant amount of time (Blazing hot plates and crispy hard buns), one looked and felt as though it had been sitting on the counter for 5-10 minutes (cold along the outside, only mildly warm in the middle), and one was actually served at the correct temperature, but without the green chiles advertised in the menu. The chicken sandwich (One of the hard bun recipients) had roughly a half teaspoon of the honey mustard on the bun that was supposed to be there, and the chicken had been so over heated by the lamps it was drier than the desert. 
I think that the kitchen could have benefited from having skilled chefs who know how to properly time food so they come out together, and perhaps making sure that the servers don't pick and choose food from other peoples orders to complete their own.
But honestly. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Just played bingo and feeling hungry? This is your go-to spot for some steak and eggs or basically any breakfast plate you're looking for. I ordered the New York steak (medium rare) with over easy eggs and a side of white toast. In comparison to what South Point has to offer there is no drastic difference other then the aura of the place. Grand Lux Cafe is a bit more elegant in style yet casual. Other then that, food was good, service was a bit slow but there was about 12 of us so totally understandable."}
{"text":"Today I decided to take my partner to the Grand Café at boulder station casino and sadly to say, we had a terrible experience. We waited for someone to take our drink order, but unfortunately I had to grab a servers attention, and the server showed no interest to take care of the table. We are not picky when it comes to service or food but today we felt completely ignored. This review is not to slander the restaurant's name. I'm sure they do a great job, but they must work on their customer service. This place has to give good service regarles of sexual orientation, race, etc."}
{"text":"We are locals here and frequent GVR alot.  Terrible food at this cafe.  Service is  so so."}
{"text":"I come here alot, but every visit gets worse and worse. Now, I am so done so I am writing the review. The greeter was friendly, she had to bus some tables to be able to sit us. We are a party of 2 adults and 1 toddler. The greeter was the reason why I gave 1 star. Our server, as usual, was horrible. She sure hates her job. Not only she got my order wrong, we had no silverware when she served our food, when I sent back my drink (strawberry piña colada, please never order this drink) she laughed cus I said it was horrible. The food was horrendous (not sure if I spelled that correctly). This is definitely the last time I come here. And I do not recommend people to waste their time and money to come eat here."}
{"text":"This place has the worst server.  One napkin no drink refills  and very rude service.  Food is ok. French fries was saggy already cuz I'm thinking it's been sitting in the kitchen for so long while their cooking my fried fish.  Never to come back here ever.  Still can't believe about that guy server"}
{"text":"Ok. I stayed here for a car show and we had breakfast and dinner here. That's how pleased we were. 

The servers and service are AMAZING. They are very helpful and literally here to serve you. I tend to ask a lot of questions about the food and if it's made fresh or if it comes canned and they answered every question to the best of their knowledge. 

For breakfast I had huevos rancheros. It was 3 fried tortillas with refried beans over and 2 over easy eggs on top. Covered in a ranchero salsa and served with handmade salsa. It was DELICIOUS! 

My friend ordered NY steak and eggs for breakfast and there was a lot of fat on the steak but she didn't complain because fat is normal on steaks and the server saw it and comped her steak. They really didn't have to do that but it was very nice and great customer service. 

For dinner I ordered chicken tenders and asked for lettuce under it. They gladly said \"we can definitely do that for you\".  The staff is great and there to serve you however you want. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"If I was going off our experience on 11/23/14 I would have given this place 1 star. But since we were there in July 2014 and loved it, I gave it an extra 2 stars.
We got the Tbone steak special in July and it was amazing! the best baked potatos and steak was really good!
This time, not so much. EVERYTHING was cold. Took forever to get our food, we were starving and didnt want to wait another 30+ min. for them to re-cook it.
We may try this place again, but wont come in starving. We will want to allow enough time to send it back if needed."}
{"text":"Decent food at decent prices.  The services was pretty good too!  Breakfast 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with OK service and decent food but this last time was the worst . Place was fairly busy. Was seated and then the nightmare started . The WORST SERVICE !!! Sat down with 2 friends then we waited and watched . First 30 minutes to get someone to acknowledge us by flagging down a manager . They bring us out water and he makes something up about tickets in the kitchen running behind whatever! We all ordered the burger special . Nothing fancy and then we watched as other people hot there food after walking in 20 min after we had sat down . Si again with the manager . He tries and tries with failure . My god get a clue on how to handle people . So we get our food one hour later which should be the end right ? Nope cant even get a water refill unless we flag someone down again .All this and no comp or accept or apologies. Instead the idiot manager says was it worth the wait . No idiot it was a 5 dollars hamburger decent but nothing special . Unless someone responds to this I will never go back!!"}
{"text":"The wait here during saturday brunch is ridiculous.
Make sure you come earlier than 10 am on a saturday morning."}
{"text":"I live about halfway between South Point and Green Valley Ranch, so those end up being the two casinos I frequent the most for gambling, movies, sportsbook, and dining. We have long enjoyed the Coronado Café at South Point, but recently we've had a few experiences there that were underwhelming.

We had only tried the Grand Café at GVR once before about a year ago, and while the food was good, the service was lackluster. We decided it had been a while and decided to give it another chance. 

We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday and there were about 7-9 people in line. Okay, that's fine. After a 15 minute wait, we got to the front of the line and waited...and waited...and waited. The host approached up and told us that from THAT moment it would be a 15 minute wait. I'm sorry, excuse me??

Just from our vantage point I counted no less than 9 empty booths and tables. There was, more than likely, even more available tables that I was unable to see. The staff seemed so disinterested and it really showed. While we decided if we wanted to continue to wait, 4 people BEHIND us decided it wasn't worth it and left. One lady said aloud what I was thinking..\"Why are we waiting 15-20 minutes with all these open tables??? It was a valid question.

We decided to throw in the towel on the Grand Café. The only other time we were here it was the service that was the problem, not the food...and over a year later, it seems as if nothing had changed. What a disappointment!

I can only imagine how much revenue they threw away due to apathy and/or laziness. Either way, we are officially done with this place.

1 star.

Hang your head and welcome to the Wall of Shame."}
{"text":"Friendly service, had the cafe hamburger very delicious.  our server kept checking up on us , and was on point with beverages"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. The food is your average American fare but well thought out for selection. Their bake case is nice to have where you can just get a nice sweet treat on your way back to your room."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean, the service was good, we had 3 different people come up to us to take our order so I was a little worried how the whole experience was going to turn out. The food was good, I even had to take a to go box, the portions are generous.
I had Apple Cobbler for Dessert and that was good too.  I would come back again and try breakfast next time"}
{"text":"Love the gamers specials here. Prices are always pretty cheap and the portion sizes are a great value. Bring back the T bone steak special!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, beautiful restaurant. I like it because it has a high end feeling not a cafe feel.   Our food came in no time and it was delicious!   Jack, the manager was on top of things.  I really like it!"}
{"text":"I just had the best steak and eggs of my life. It was perfectly cook of the steak (Medium rare) and the portion was just right. 

I used to go to different place to get my steak and eggs but when I found this place, I became regular here. This is one of a place that has better quality of the steak. Yes, the steak and eggs here is a little expensive compare to others. When you talk about the quality of the steak, I will probably pick this place.

Also, they have an amazing spinach & artichoke dip with pita bread for $4.79. It's for two servings. You can't bet that. 

Our server Sam is very approachable. She's always ask if we needed anything. 

This place will be my regular for steak and eggs! 

Reminder: 
You must atleast be 21 yrs or someone who is 21 with you with players card at this station casino to get this deal. That's all the catch for this late night graveyard special."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price. I enjoy the environment and the staff is very friendly. I usually try to bring my out of town friends and family in for meals. Deserts are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Just got off work and came by the casino to relax, have a drink, and get some dinner. I'm a server myself!  Checked out the menu outside the door before entering so that I'd be able to place my order right when I got inside. You have to order from the bartender who was unfriendly with a bad attitude.  I ordered a cheeseburger and I asked what came on it and she said lettuce, tomato and pickles. She asked what temperature I wanted it cooked which was medium well.  I returned 10 minutes later to pick up my dinner and didn't check it.  When I opened the box there was a burger with cheese on toasted white bread instead of a bun and there were no toppings.  Went to return it and the  bartender told me I ordered a different item and if I'd ordered the cheeseburger she would've asked me the questions she DID ask me!   After that,  she said if I wanted it fixed all they would do is put this burger on a bun.  REALLY?  She then said if I wanted it recooked it would be another 10 minutes. By this time with all the aggravation I lost my appetite and asked for my money back.  The manager gave me back my money and apologized but didn't ask any questions about what was wrong? Why???   Station Casinos logo is that they LOVE LOCALS, yet this definitely was not an example of that especially since I AM A LOCAL and work next door to the casino which I frequent often !!!!   Will go back to Tides where I always have great service.  Won't be back here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Had the corned beef and cabbage on St. patricks day.
It was a little dry, but they brought out some chicken broth to wet it. I was expecting whole, boiled potatoes, but it came with mashed, which was ok.
The worst part is the booths are horribly worn out. You sink so low, it's impossible to get comfortable in one."}
{"text":"Bf and I were starving after playing 3 rounds of bingo (if you're at sunset station, check it out!) and he wanted prime rib so we decided to go to Grand Cafe. The quality of the food looked better than the feast buffet Sunset Station also offers so we went here instead. There was no wait when we went, but the host was a little slow in seating us. There's a TON of seating and the booth was comfy. I saw some baked goods in the display case when we walked in but by the time dinner was over, I was too full. 

Service was ok, we didn't see much of our server after he took our order. Luckily for us, condiments were on the table. I ordered the steak and eggs ($13)... yes, kind of expensive for steak and eggs compared to other locations near the strip like Marilyn's cafe or Ellis Island but it was 200x's better than those places. I've paid the $5-6 for the steak and egg specials and the quality of the steak, of course, sucked. I've also paid regular price of $10-13 and they also don't compare to the steak and eggs I had here! My bf's prime rib came with green beans and choice of mashed potatoes, fries or baked potato and he chose mashed potatoes. The prime rib was just OK. I think the prime rib at Ellis Island was better. Maybe because the prime rib here was over cooked (even though he asked for it medium) it came out well done. 

I would definitely be back next time for their steak and eggs again!"}
{"text":"Food is kinda bland. I had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I could have gotten better chicken at KFC at a cheaper price. Service was slow but at least the servers were nice. Not the best of the grand cafes of stations casinos."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We sat down and was finally helped 10 minutes later with drinks. She said she would be back, 26 minutes later, still nothing. Horrible service. Will not be coming back or recommending to anyone. Why continue to sit people when there's tables waiting to put their order in? Horrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night whim with a friend for a midnight snack and was surprised how good it was!  Once we got past the spaced-out hostess whom we had to tell 3 times that we would like a booth for two until it registered, all was excellent. The booth seats were like marshmallow clouds, the ambiance and décor beautiful, the waiter was top-notch, our strawberry and mango coladas were perfection...but the brownie for two was absolutely out-of-this-world!  Tasted like it was fresh and warm from grandma's oven with big walnuts, fresh vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and sprinkles on top. Sooooooo good we didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"Service was awful.  They aren't prepared for an increase in customers right at midnight when their late night specials start.  We showed up right after midnight along with maybe four or five other small parties.  They made us wait a good 20 minutes before seating us even though the restaurant was only about a quarter full at the time.  The staff had a cold demeanor.  Food was okay, but not worth the wait or the bad service.  The staff and manager at night at the Grand Cafe at Sunset Station provide exceptional service that is both friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my family and cannot complain. I've had their omelette and their huevos rancheros (more like nachos) both really delicious. Only problem was during a Sunday be prepare to wait a long time for your food. They also have really good coffee."}
{"text":"Shanna from Massachusetts was wicked awesome. :)  I took my boyfriend and his mother out for Mother's Day Sunday Brunch.   Food was great.  I had a Bacon \"plattah\" (platter) eggs over hard, extra crispy hash browns with a side of grapes.  Mom had Chicken Pasta deal came with dessert. Boyfriend had French Toast which I cheated my diet and had a small bite covered in  syrup. :D

Ask to be seated with Shanna. I will ask for her every time we're here in the afternoon."}
{"text":"we arrived at sunset station about an hour early to grab a quick lunch before our movie. We were going to go to cabo but found out that they open at 5pm. so instead of heading to the buffet we decided to try grand cafe. 
Being in a hurry after we were seated we scanned the menu quickly...my fiance ordered a prime rib dip sandwich which he loved!! came with fries and a little side of coleslaw
I ordered an applewood bacon burger with cheddar cheese also came with fries and coleslaw.
Both were very good only gave 3 stars because my fries were alittle stale tasting and the cafe had a cafeteria feel to  it. 
we would go back for something quick."}
{"text":"Midnight specials(midnight to 6 a.m/) honored with your boarding pass. Super cheap and large, awesome portions.  No complaints here. Had the 8 oz steak, hash browns, eggs and toast for $5.99!! Their country fried steak with sides is ONLY $4.99 and is enormous!  The decor in this place is nice, but the service could improve greatly. They were very SLOW and it wasn't busy.  A special thank you to Cashmere who works at the pastry/desert counter. She is a pleasure and excellent with customer service. :)"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here every morning during our three-day stay.

The food was average as was the service.

Usually have a short wait to get seated and to get your check when you finished eating.

I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Restaurant was busy. Service was very good today. They served me the chocolate donut poppers hot. 
I love to eat desert first and you should try it. Mmmm it's good,
Ordered sliders and they were packed with meat and cheese plus fries were hot and fresh. 
Check came right away and was a perfect business lunch."}
{"text":"The rice that came with my loco moco was hard and crunchy like it came from the bottom of the pot and was just left overs. The hamburger patty in the loco moco was the size of a hamburger from a McDonald's kids meal cheeseburger. The server only came to check up on us after we were done eating and I had to wait forever for my water to get refilled."}
{"text":"If you want service, don't let them sit you at the counter. 10 min I waited to be acknowledged while the waitress stood just behind the kitchen door loudly giggling and carrying on with her coworkers. Meanwhile people are coming in being sat left and right with their orders being taken swiftly. 

If you are going to play around do it out of sight of the guest."}
{"text":"Awesome midnight to morning deals! Full meal for $3.99 and add two big pancakes for $0.99! Pancakes were sweet and tasty covered with powdered sugar. Prompt service and the two of us are full meals for just over $10."}
{"text":"Husband and I ordered a late breakfast. He had belgian waffle breakfast, I has the corned beef hash. 
The bad: Corned beef hash was nothing special, tasted like the stuff you get out out a can. My hash browns were blond, rather firm, and possibly starting to turn bad... They had that slightly-off taste. My husband's scrambled eggs were watery (not runny, but surrounded by liquid). The belgian waffle was also cold by the time it came out... It had obviously sat in the window for a while while my food was bring prepared. 
The good: fresh, hot coffee (they left the thermos pot on the table, which was nice), sausage links were fine, waffle was fine, my food was piping hot when it came out. 
The total came to $26, which is more than the meal was worth, considering the poor quality of the breakfast food."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the Grand Cafe shares a kitchen with the buffet. Ordered the southwest breakfast bowl and was thoroughly disappointed. I am pretty sure it was a compilation of pre-made. Food slopped into a bowl and reheated in an oven briefly. Less than inspiring would be an overstatement."}
{"text":"Food prices are VERY reasonable and the food is really good. Definitely not bad for a hotel cafe. The $5.00 burger and fries was SO good and so was the $5.99 ham skillet. The servers are all super nice and did a great job anticipating our needs. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've had the smoked salmon egg benedict a few times. Definitely my favorite place for breakfast if I'm at the Green Valley Ranch. Highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Absolutely abysmal. We waited for 30+ minutes to be seated at 9pm on a Sunday night. Finally, we sat at the bar and NO ONE took our order - even drinks - for 30+ minutes. The only contact we had was with the keno lady! We come stay here every year and have never dealt with this BS.

Absolutely abysmal. We waited for 30+ minutes to be seated at 9pm on a Sunday night. Finally, we sat at the bar and NO ONE took our order - even drinks - for 30+ minutes. The only contact we had was with the keno lady! We come stay here every year and have never dealt with this BS.

UPDATE - had to call the hotel to get a hold of a manager just to get some service - WHILE I WAS SEATED AT THE BAR!!! She was rude and dense. I showed her the keno ticket with the time stamp proving we sat there for 45 minutes with no service and she argued with me. I have never seen so much red."}
{"text":"Marina was our server and she was fantastic. She is very attentive and professional. I ordered eggs benedict asking for the english muffin to be crispy and that's exactly how I got it. I've eaten here many times before and never had a bad meal. The soups, new york steak, roasted chicken, meatloaf, sandwiches, burgers, salads and breakfast are all good.  They have a decent selection of bakery items by the cashier.  The prices are reasonable and the cafe is open 24/7. Tip:  The back of the menu has specials for anyone with a players card which are pretty good deals."}
{"text":"Gees, a lot of bad reviews. I have been coming here for years and never experienced the bad service or terrible food a lot of Yelpers are complaining about but if you are expecting gourmet food perhaps a cafe is not the place for you.  We were seated around 1pm and Robert was our server. He was very nice and always checked on us at the right times.  I ordered the Southwestern Salad which was delicious. Consists of greens, tomatoes, corn, beans, cheese, fresh avocado slices, red onion, bell peppers,  tortilla strips,  and plenty of fresh cubed cold chicken tossed in just the right amount of chipolte dressing which really compliments this salad. There is plenty of everything in the salad and has been consistent for the last two years that I have ordered it. My husband had the meatloaf which had gravy on it, a scoop of mashed potatoes and string beans and he said it was good. Chicken noodle soup was good.  Cream of mushroom soup was okay,  it was blended so there were no pieces of mushrooms in it which is what I like but it was flavorful and it tasted homemade. The young man at the cashier was very nice and courteous. So no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Excellent ham skillet breakfast and excellent service! Stopped in late night and truthfully didn't expect much because of the time but boy was I wrong. The service was excellent and my breakfast was excellent. I got the ham skillet and everything was cooked to perfection. The ham steak was HUGE and  the best I've ever had..... tender and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Holy heck! This place was beyond bad. One star is too much. We were heading out of town for the afternoon and decided to stop off at Santa Fe Station for brunch. Our intention was to hit the buffet but the line was too long. The Grand Cafe was right there and didn't look too busy so we decided to just eat there. Now it is Saturday so the place wasn't empty but it wasn't terribly crowded as far as Saturdays go. We walked right up to the hostess, told her there were five of us. She said to wait while she found a table. I could see plenty of empty tables but whatever. While we were waiting, the manager came out and asked, \"How many?\" I responded, \"Someone is already helping us. She went to find a table.\" The manager then very rudely snapped at me, \"How many?\" I told him five and then he turned away from me and started talking to another hostess. Meanwhile our hostess came back and led us to a table. 

Our server showed up right away to take our drink orders and then she disappeared. It took a very, very long time to get our drinks. While I'm on the drinks...the kids' menu showcased two drinks. They were very large photographs. There were no other drinks mentioned anywhere on the kids menu. When we placed our drink order my two youngest each ordered one of those drinks. We were told they are not part of the kids meal and we'd be charged extra. The drinks also showed up in regular glasses instead of the kids cups with lids. I found this very weird and misleading. Why showcase both drinks on the kids menu if they are not kids drinks?? My orange juice tasted really sour as if it were old. 

We placed our order and waited, and waited and waited. A server for a nearby table saw my look of death and came over to assure me our order was being put on a tray right then. She'd just seen it was up and ready. Yeah, right. We continued to wait and wait and wait. Finally, our server showed up and apologized saying that the corporate chef was there. I have no idea what that means or why that means service is so slow. I was just happy to have our food. We had plans out of town and our tickets required us to be there at a specific time. We were now running late. 

Ok, so the food...bleh!! It was sooo bad! My oldest son ordered the french toast. It was so soggy it was dough. My youngest ordered pancakes that were not cooked through. My husband had the same issue. My hashbrowns were the most disgusting I'd ever had...ever. They were bland mush. I specifically ordered an omelet without mushrooms. It had mushrooms. I had ordered a side of fruit. It came with tastless melon and one strawberry that had been quartered to give the illusion that i got more than one. Nice try. My husband ordered a side of bacon and it never came. We spent maybe five minutes with our food before giving up and deciding just to leave.  

This was truly a terrible experience and possibly the worst we've had in our four years in Las Vegas. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because I had meal comp from the casino. 
Menu ranges from breakfast items, to sandwiches, and some random entrees. No real theme here, just different stuff. Fish tacos to steak, to country fried steak, to fish and chips, grilled chicken, etc. I don't think it would be hard to find something for everyone in your group here. 
Ordered french onion soup, which was tasty and cheesy, along with the prime rib sandwich and au jus.. or however you spell it. The sandwich was massive, stuffed with so much yummy prime rib you can barely get your mouth around it.. Well, unless you happen to be Steven Tyler. French fries were only ok, a was the fried fish my boyfriend got. Pretty decent prices on draft bear.. but a glass of mountain dew was almost the same price as the beer?? What the hell? 
I'd probably eat here again, it's better than the buffet, and will run you around the same. Waitress needs to check her attitude at the door though, if she ever wants to get tips."}
{"text":"For all of the awesome places Green Valley Ranch offers, this is probably the least impressive of them all.  It's no surprise but the 24 hour cafe / diner is always at the bottom of the restaurant totem pole in casinos, but this one is especially bad for its lackluster service and mediocre food.

I have come here on several occasions and while things are okay during the daytime, the night time really suffers due to the lack of wait staff.  Especially around 2AM, I understand that there aren't going to be a lot of bodies around due to the hour and I know it may be even less since its not on the strip.  But my simple meal of hashbrowns, sausage, and eggs should not have taken 45 minutes.  My waitress was out of excuses and filling my water became a chore for her after awhile.  The food was not good, somewhere between sucky and really sucky.  At least the prices were solid but the place on a whole is depressing given its lack of lighting and crowded table placement.

I'll stick to the other restaurants for now.  I just wish their buffet was open late at night."}
{"text":"Wrost customer service ever. Been waiting for over 20 minutes for an order of 4 hamburgers. My family and I have been here 2 weeks ago and order the same thing.  We got our food and our drinks were being refilled without the need of flagging our service. When we inquired about our food, our server told us that it's not ready yet. Really?? It's been over 20 mins. These are burgers not filet mignon. Hope management reads this and gets their act together.  This is unacceptable. There was not even an acknowledgement from our server how we were doing or an update when our food will be ready."}
{"text":"As far as the Chicken Fried Steak goes, it was fairly decent and I was pleasantly surprised. The meat couldn't be cut with only a fork, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The breading was actually very good and could very well be responsible for putting the \"chicken fried\" in chicken fried steak. It was fresh and crispy. The gravy was thick with a middle-of-road rating for flavor. Maybe some sausage and a little more pepper would have done the trick. The meal came with eggs, hash browns and a biscuit. The hash browns were average at best. The eggs were cooked as ordered and on par with anywhere else. At $2.49, the coffee was a little overpriced as was the $3.79 orange juice. The waitress was friendly as was the keno runner."}
{"text":"Even in a great eating town like Las Vegas, there will always be the mediocre.  Not great, not horrid, just... competent.  Solid food without panache or élan.  This is the Grand Café, of the many dining spots in Texas Station, a northern outpost of the Stations Casino company.  Perhaps the most impressive element of the restaurant is just as one enters and passes the glass-enclosed desert case, featuring visually and gustatory mouth watering sweets.

Service, too, is competent, nothing to set it apart from better establishments.  Even with only three tables occupied, my server seemed very busy, walking back and forth for water and other accouterments, when she could have easily used a hand-held tray to bring everything at once.  

Menu offerings are many and, since I was hungry, I found myself considering several different options, from platters to sandwiches.  My server answered my questions honestly, as I inquired about the type of liver served, whether calves or beef, and the soup of the day.  I settled on the fish and chips platter, which I wanted to compare with the same offering at the Tropicana's Beach Café.  I requested a hot sauce, and was asked my choice from three brands, a nice touch.  Once my order was placed, I timed the wait, from when my server left the table to the arrival of my food.  As everything on the plate was fried - fish and potatoes - the 17 minute wait seemed just a tad more than it should have.

The three large logs of compressed fish were a larger portion than the five smaller ones at the Trop.  Fries requested well done were just done just right.  I asked for both cocktail and tartar sauces, though the menu specifies the word \"or\".  Neither the fish or fries were greasy, though the spuds had been salted, which I liked. Others may not share that enjoyment.  The sauces were, again, competent, and the meal, while fine, was forgettable.  Would it hurt the bottom line to include a small side of coleslaw, a natural accompaniment with this type of platter?

I had a coupon for a free desert, and so I indulged in a large slab of their strawberry cake, a heavily-frosted affair, devoid of any flavor but sugary sweetness.  Which is not to say it was bad because of that.  With a cup of strong coffee this would be a great late-night indulgence.  Otherwise, it was crumbly, and not as moist  as it might have been, were it not sitting unwrapped in the lovely case at front.      

Overall service, as usual, was less than stellar.  I was staying at the hotel and was already checked in.  Many such venues include promotional items with a stay, and thus it was here with a liberal dining allowance given upon arrival.  However, the front end manager told me nothing of the sort existed for me and this set in motion phone calls until, finally, all was resolved.  This was not the first time for this occurrence and the inconvenience is more than a bit annoying.

The Grand Café is not a destination, in my estimation.  It is a place to grab a late night snack of to fill up on unremarkable edibles.  Or to eat for free when offered."}
{"text":"This place is off the strip and STILL more than you would think to pay for regular food, but whatever. Service is horrible and according to fam that have been a few times, it always is. People were seated 10+min after us and got their food before us. Not like we ordered hard stuff, a club sandwich, not toasted, a Cobb salad, that was pretty small for reg size salad, and an omelette. Had to ask to get my water filled and it only got filled once. There was only one other table with people when we first arrived in our server's area. When we got our lemons for our water one was already used...gross. Makes me really think that some places do reuse their stuff that comes back to kitchens after guests leave. It took our server 15min just to grab us some to go boxes. The avocados that came with my salad looked nice from one side but when I flipped them over they were gross and all brown. Then it took him 10min to bring new avocado, and still left an empty glass of water. If  u expect a tip, I expect good service, be paid attention to, and my water glass to have water in it. Just be attentive! If there were more food spots in the area, I would go elsewhere but there isn't being off the strip."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place. We sat at the bar to avoid the long wait and I'm so happy that we did. The Sunday bartender is awesome. I had a great time because of him. Of course I ordered my staple breakfast of steak and eggs, scrambled with cheese and it was delicious. Breakfast potatoes were seasoned perfectly. The Boyfriend ordered the same (with different eggs) and he also really enjoyed it. Soooo good! 

The real standout is the bloody mary. Probably one of the best I've ever had. So, the food is a little pricey but it is good so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast this morning after work before heading home to Socal while I stayed at the Santa Fe. The restaurant was fairly empty which I appreciated. I was greeted right away by a friendly waitress who promptly brought my drink. I ordered the huevos rancheros with scrambled egg whites, which were no extra charge. They huevos rancheros were a generous portion with crispy tortillas, egg whites, beans, cheese, ranchero sauce, guacamole, sour cream, and a beautifully roasted whole jalapeno. I did think the the service of the food itself was a little slow for the emptiness of the restaurant, but maybe I was just hungry. The prices were really reasonable. $10 for the whole breakfast and drink. They have a really nice counter by the cash register with many delicious looking bakery treats, which I unfortunately didn't try. I would come back."}
{"text":"Whenever I come I always get the chicken wings and bananas foster french toast.  Yesterday I also got the bottomless mimosas for $10"}
{"text":"This definitely is only a go to place when its more convenient and there aren't any other choices.  When I go to place, I'm looking at the quality for what it is I'm paying for.  I couldn't decide what to get, so I went with something simple, Chicken Fingers.  Boy did I feel disappointed.  My plate seem bare with tiny fingers.  I guess the big plate it was placed on made my food seem really small as if I was really getting 3 chicken strips for $10.00 with several sticks of carrots and celery.  I wouldn't look for quality here.  I could be wrong.  Other things on their menu could probably make up for this.

So with that being said, Happy Eating's!"}
{"text":"My family and I love coming her for brunch, the food is always delicious and costumer service is alway good!  We love their coffee and their pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Money -Saving TIP...we ordered an omelette entree plus a side of pancakes...the kitchen split our meal...muchas gracias!!!"}
{"text":"Nice prime rib for $13. Dessert selection in the front case was nice as well. Service could've been a little more attentive but all in all not bad"}
{"text":"The worst $20 I've every spent on food. I usually eat healthy but wanted to be in and out fast. I got fried shrimp. The shrimp and fries were awful, not cooked long enough. The cocktail sauce tasted like chemicals. I may have been tired but should have taken the extra steps and minutes to eat at any other restaurant in this hotel. I'm highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was just craving for a biscuit and gravy and I was about to get it for to go then I decided to grab some drink. I asked for a mojito and the bar tender named  \"John\" asked me which flavor because it's his specialty. I told him to surprise me and lo and behold, he made me a watermelon mojito. I might sound like I am exaggerating if I say it is by far, \"THE BEST MOJITO I'VE EVER HAD IN MY EXISTENCE\" but it's true... Ask for John and he will make you the best drink"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.. we sat down for 15 mins and not once did we get offered a drink.. we got up and left.. this place is horrible and so unorganized!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place only got 3 stars! I'm shocked. For me, it's all about food, service and prices. This place has it all. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and late night snacks. Every single time it was good...great actually. The breakfast special can't be beat. $4 or 5 bucks for 2 eggs, potatoes, toast and choice of pig product. It always comes out hot and fresh. My favorite is having some drinks while playing the slots and then going and getting a dessert from the cold case in the front. Can you say YUM!! I haven't had a bad dessert from them and the prices are GREAT!!! Sometimes there is a wait to sit down, sometimes not. As long as it's not more than 10 minutes, it's worth it. It's good food, great on your wallet and the servers are always really nice. The come 'round and make sure your drinks are filled and it they can get you anything else. YAY! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The Chinese chicken salad was fresh and tasty. My husband had the steak and shrimp. The steak was good but the shrimp was not as good as we had hoped. A little pricey for our budget but the portions were generous and the service was good."}
{"text":"This place is like Denny's, but not as good, and we don't even like Denny's. The service was great but the food was meh.

I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The cheese wasn't that melted, and the soup was inedible.

My husband ordered the BBQ bacon burger, which he says was passable. The garlic parmesan fries lacked parmesan and had no garlic. 

We ordered the Triple Dip Chip appetizer. The guacamole was basically brown, but the bean and cheese dip were tolerable. 

We only came here because we had a coupon. We would have been really upset if we didn't have one. 

If you're broke or extremely hungover, then the food here would probably taste great. Otherwise, it's a let down."}
{"text":"Food was average.  Recommend the banana foster French toast.  Meals to avoid chicken and waffles (horrible).  Service was good, waitress very friendly but took over 30 minutes for food to be served."}
{"text":"I know that when it comes to Vegas things get torn down for new stuff all of the time.
The Santa Fe has had a change in owners over time and a change inside as well. I miss the good ole days before Stations took it over.

The Grand Cafe just isn't what it should be. None of them are consistent at any of the Stations which always baffles my mind.

We stopped in after midnight to play some nickel slots and decided to go to the Cafe for some of the specials they have after a certain hour.

I decided to get the \"Breakfast Skillet\". It was good but I asked for extra cheddar and onions on my hash browns and instead I got neither and they came out sorta burnt on the outside and cold on the inside. It only cost $2.99 which would be a perfect deal if it came out how you ordered it and didn't have to wait 30 minutes.

We had terrible service. Had to wait forever for drink refills and it took forever for our food to come out. 2 other tables were seated and their orders taken before ours was even taken. When it came time to pay there was nobody at the register until about 5 or so minutes later. If I weren't so honest I could have walked right off with out paying.

So sad what this place has turned into :("}
{"text":"Last weekend was our 2nd time at this restaurant. The food was pretty good but the service was absolutely terrible!  Our waitress was so rude and absolutely had no customer service. My husband's order came with a side of gravy which had tipped over while the waitress was bringing it to our table. There was gravy everywhere and she did nothing to clean it up or even offer more gravy until we asked. Beautiful place but due to the poor service I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is pretty much non existant!  I watched an 85 yr old woman get up and ask the hostess where the waitress was and she had been waiting longer than us.  After we got our order in, the food came out 40 minutes later and the french toast was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter.   The problem was that they were seating people at tables that had no waiter/waitress taking care of them.  Obviously severely understaffed and unorganized with management who don't really care."}
{"text":"Awesome. Delicious. Inexpensive. Always a good meal for a date night. You can play Keno and win some money while you eat. :-)"}
{"text":"Big portions and reasonable prices do not make up for under seasoned bland food. It's hard to make breakfast undesirable but this place managed to do so. The service was excellent and the reason two stars were given but not worth visiting here again."}
{"text":"A nice Diner.  Have had good service 90% of the time.  Their NY steak is very delicious, tastes fresh, and is a healthy portion at a good price.  The shrimp cocktail and wedge salad are also very tasty.  The only downside is having to walk through the casino smoke to get there.  Once inside the restaurant, smoke is not a problem."}
{"text":"Was waiting for 10mins before our server came over and finally took our order. The food is decent but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"This place is hands down AMAZING.  They seriously can do no wrong.  The food is delicious and affordable while the service is prompt and welcoming.  My main place to go when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place would be 4 stars if the service was better, I think that everyone has complained about the service. We waited 20 minutes after being seated just to get our drink order. Then had to chase the waiter down to get the check. 

The prime rib was very nice, the potato was huge, and very good. The cheese eggs were very good as well. I enjoyed the food, just the service sucked."}
{"text":"I have only experienced worse service once in my entire life. Do not waste your time going to this place. The food is okay but you could literally serve yourself faster by walking to Whole Foods a mile away. Terrible place."}
{"text":"Wait staff is too busy, rushed to be polite enough to not rush the order.  Tea was switched for raspberry.  Uggg.  Ordered bisquits and gravy which came out and looked sad.  Huge plate, w 2 tiny stale bisquits w barely any gravy, asked for more gravy and was given a shot glass sized serving.  Eggs were over cooked and hash browns were so salty i choked.  The other order was prime rib, half of it was fat and grissle.  Quality was terible today."}
{"text":"THANK YOU CHARLOTTE! 
Your service was phenomenal!! 
My family decided to sit down for desert while my hubby gambled. What a great choice!! We only had desert and drinks, and it was perfect! 
But, CHARLOTTE TRULY WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF OUR VISIT. She she was so classy and elegant. Thank you Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice - once for dinner and more recently for breakfast - and haven't been disappointed.

Their breakfast options are prefect for the typical breakfast liver. We had a custom-made omlette and the Bread Pudding French Toast and both were absolutely amazing.

The omlette was cooked perfectly and tasted great.

The Bread Pudding French Toast tho...oh wow!! It hit the spot. Just the right amount of crunchy and soft with butter and whipped cream and some syrup. It was spectacular!

Service was excellent, although the food took awhile to come out of the kitchen. We almost wondered if they forgot about us. I'm chocking that up to the fact that we were there on Christmas day.

We will definitely be back for another round of breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here was awesome! We ordered the station's signature buttermilk pancakes and the make your own omelet and it comes with a side and the choice of coffee cake or toast. We thought both were very good. The pancakes were a huge portion, easily sharable between two people. Overall we had a great breakfast here!"}
{"text":"We were in Texas Station casino and ended up having dinner at the Grand Cafe.  The casino and restaurant were empty.  We played the slots and got our free drinks.  Then we went into the restaurant.  I had the Chicken Pamigiana with split pea soup.  The chicken and soup were very good, but the spaghetti was tasteless.  I did not finish the spaghetti.  The Texas toast was just ok.  

We had planed to go to the new Pasta Cucina restaurant but they close at 9: pm, how strange for a Friday night.  The good think is they will accept the restaurant.com certificates from the former San Lorenzo Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Extremely pissed that my boyfriend and I spent $60 for shitty service, raw meat and food poisoning. If I could give them 0 stars I would. My boyfriend asked for his steak to be medium rare, and the meat was extremely red and bloody. As he was cutting into it, all you saw was blood from the steak on his plate. Me being disappointed, I tried to get the attention of our waiter but she was no where in sight at all. I told my boyfriend,\"if you get sick over this, I'm going to be pissed.\" Instead we caught a gentleman who looked like a manager, and I tried to explain to him how the steak prepared was raw and I wouldn't want my boyfriend eating it. I told him how he ordered a medium rare steak... he told me,\"but ma'am that's what a medium rare steak looks like. If we cook it again or put it back on the grill, it's just going to turn out looking the same.\" Very unprofessional! I almost told him to send it back or throw it away. I know what my boyfriend's steak usually looks like wherever we go, and it does not look like that. I am not stupid. First time we went here service and food was great. We are never coming here again, after what happened yesterday."}
{"text":"We came here for players card breakfast special for $3.99. 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon with a piece of toast. This special is also at Green Valley Grand Cafe as well. Let's face it, this is difficult to beat. Here's the bottom line, we had this special at GVR and received half a hash brown on the plate and the scrambled egg portion was smaller. My mate and I both took notice of this as soon as our server, Nikki, brought the food out here at Sunset Station. Why would they give smaller portions at GVR, I'm perplexed?  Anyway, service was excellent, loved the music and our food couldn't have been better. We will definitely be back here more"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite cafe in the Station Casino group for years. I always felt their menu was more health conscious and servers are more accommodating. My last two visits here have been a real struggle when it comes to food preparation, unfortunately. Today before I ordered Eggs Benedict, I asked,  James, my server, if it was possible to have them without Canadian bacon and sub spinach & tomato. Without skipping a beat he said, no problem and I told him I wanted my poached eggs cooked medium, no runny whites on this order. When they arrived they were so runny they had slid off the English muffins and the girl said she thought she needed to have them redone when she noted my request. James came back by and brought me a complimentary fresh fruit bowl and apologized that his instructions had not been noted. I wasn't bothered about the wait just wanted the eggs cooked properly. When he brought them back to the table I could see the eggs clearly were still runny because there was only a spoon full of hollandaise sauce on top. He also noted the English muffin was not even toasted and was a soggy mess and said he was sorry and would have them redone. I was just over it at this point and pushed the eggs off to the side and ate the spinach, tomato and hash browns. He offered to send a manager over and I asked him to please NOT because I really didn't give a damn about having them comp this crappy attempt, I just wanted to be done. Toward the end of my meal he came by and said the meal was comped anyway and once again apologized. Great service here for sure but definite problems in the kitchen getting food prepared properly."}
{"text":"I'm craving something sweet whilst taking a ride on my bike. I stroll up to Texas Station, fully aware of their bakery and food rep. I decide to take a couple sweets to go for the familia and I. Grabbed a vanilla cupcake, a strawberry cheese cake, chocolate peanut butter cupcake, and a Dutch Apple pie.

Ordered a cold green tea and took a seat at the Starbuck's next door. I attempt to take a forkful of vanilla cupcake. My plastic fork bent. Literally. Not joking. This cake has to be days old. At least. The frosting is hard and has no lightness or fluff. It's a mound of ground down sugar, assaulting the tongue. I was dissatisfied. I had to try something else, hoping for a fluke cupcake. Nope. The cheesecake is warm and has the same artificial flavor as a jolly rancher. The Dutch Apple pie was, at one point, dropped somewhere. And I don't even want to try the other cupcake. I'm definitely not giving any of these to the family. These go right in the trash outside in the parking lot. It is actually impossible to believe that these were made in house at the Grand Cafe. Such a disappointment. I preceded to order a mini vanilla scone and a cake pop at the Starbuck's. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"we have been going here a lot and was looking forward to going again...when we got there, we were told it'd be at least 15 minutes and the place was 90% EMPTY. so, I asked, \"majority of the tables are empty, so why the wait?\"  she said it was because the other wait staff hadn't started yet. so let me get this right, rather than just give someone who's already working another table, you'd rather make people wait? needless to say, we did NOT wait & walked down to the buffet and got right in."}
{"text":"Liver was not cooked all the way through. Tilapia had no seasoning. The Blackend prime rib egg Benedict was...well...the eggs were good, but the prime rib was like shoe leather (maybe they got the liver confused with the prime rib). The Benedict was served with sourdough. I must have misread the menu because I thought it said English muffin. And if that was not enough (and God don't you think it should be) the crackers, served with the chicken noodle soup, were stale. The 1 star is for the eggs and our server, Dennis. He was good, it is not his fault that Station Casinos feel they need to lessen the quality of their food, so that they can send their money to name a field at Bishop Gorman and get their coach to UNLV. Their father must be looking down with disgust."}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas dinner and the wait wasn't long at all! Maybe 7 minutes max! We got seated and our waitress Tiffany instantly greeted our table and quickly took our drink orders. She was extremely friendly and personable and made this breakfast even more wonderful than we could've hoped for. She got our order down without even writing it down and taking care of multiple other tables! We are SO impressed with this restaurant and the waitress Tiffany I'll be back and requesting her! 
Very happy we decided to go to the Grand Cafe instead of the Buffet! Thank you Tiffany for making this experience so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious. And quick service.  Not the best bout still good. Generous portions not too expensive okay atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good food. Some of it is very good
Kevin is great. Personable, friendly, and extremely on the ball."}
{"text":"Here's the lowdown: 

Grand Café is a comfortable place to grab good eats at a decent price.  (4 stars) 

Unfortunately, the service isn't so good.  It's unreliable--on the average, your server will be polite at a minimum, but nothing to rave about.  For instance, one kid has a tendency to take your table's order without writing anything down; not bad for simple orders, but I haven't had the opportunity to test him with a particularly picky order yet.  It's admirable that he has the ability to remember the table's order, but it definitely doesn't leave you with the feeling that he cares.  (2 stars)

Thus, I have to leave this place with an average, 3-star rating.  If service improved, I would have no problem rating Grand Café 4 stars, especially since their food warrants it.  

On a side note, the hostess & several waitresses (different visits) have informed my family & me that the Boarding Pass specials are only valid with the purchase of a beverage.  They directed me to the \"fine print\" on their specials sign/advertisement, but thanks to my ability to read, I was able to discern that the sign/advertisement DOES NOT indicate any such requirement.  Nonetheless, upon my last visit my waitress informed me that \"the system needs a beverage on the check for each special in order for the special price to be honored.\"  I'd give this place 2 stars, but the food is worth the crappy service.  Just thank the wait staff with a smaller tip accordingly and enjoy your cheaper, delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I've been staying at GVR this wknd., and I decided to order breakfast from the cafe. The lady at the counter was so overwhelmed by \"the new system,\" she literally asked me to order something else. I told her that wasn't an option, so she yelled (and I mean yelled) out for assistance for someone to help her. At that moment, I just decided to walk away and went to Starbucks."}
{"text":"the apple turnover were good but a little over charged for that. the cashier was not a honest person either... she overcharged me thinking i wasn't paying attention, and when i complained of the overcharge she refunded me and felt confused for being caught... and kept apologizing to me. we tried all the pastries there . i recommend that place but watch ur bill..."}
{"text":"I keep giving the Grand Cafe a second chance and then I keep regretting it. The service is incredibly slow and the food is only mediocre."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went in at 12:30 on Sunday and sat for 20 minutes without even being acknowledged. I tried to wave down a few servers and employees and no one would make eye contact with me. Just got up and left. They act like no one has other options for food in this area..... bye Felicia"}
{"text":"Over the years, this coffee shop has been all over the place.  I once vowed I'd never return.  Now that it's no longer Coco's, we stayed for dinner.

I had the chicken Cobb salad and my wife had a turkey sandwich on sourdough.  Both meals were very good and we had very good service.  They've gone up in my estimation and we'll probably return.  It was nice to go somewhere different."}
{"text":"My guy and I were craving a full breakfast yesterday, which we do from time to time, so we checked out Yelp for some advice. Funny, we noticed that Green Valley Grand Cafe had only 3 stars on Yelp, very surprising since we have been multiple times for breakfast and always enjoyed it as well as the service. We decided that we would go and find out if the reviews were correct. Once again, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience! Our server Jason, was friendly, attentive, and personable. I ordered the waffle breakfast and everything really hit the spot. My hubby ordered a scramble which he thoroughly enjoyed, along with a side of ham. He said the ham was so tasty that he could have gotten only the ham for breakfast and been perfectly content. I have the distinct feeling that people must be hungover and cranky from losing their money when I read so many negative reviews yet, from experience, know this restaurant to be a good, dependable place to grab a bite to eat. Also, the servers in these places work hard, I always try to be nice and I usually get the same back. Oh yeah, they make a killer Spicy Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"They said the green crap on my food is USDA dye stamp. Really?!! Then cut it out before serving it to me. How am I to get the mold image out of my head!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant for 24 hour food. They serve pretty standard American cuisine and the prices are quite reasonable. I always get the value skillet- 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast for $3.99. Always filling and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Nothing really 'Grand' about the café in Santa Fe Station.

This review is mainly for my sandwich.  Those in the know, know I like my club sandwiches.  Bacon, no bacon, ham, no ham, turkey, extra turkey, white bread, wheat bread, rye bread, even 7 grain bread -  I pretty much like them all and base a lot of my dining in American restaurants off of this particular sandwich.  If I don't know what to order off of a classic menu, I always gravitate towards a club sandwich.  Only rule I have is...the damn thing better be a TRIPLE layer!  That means 3 slices of bread!  I dare not call it a proper club sandwich without that extra layer of bread.

Being a late night for some reason (were we shopping?) and too lazy to cook, all the places we thought about eating on a weeknight had closed after 9 PM or were too far from home.  Not in the mood for fast food we somehow ended up at the Grand Café.  

Luckily it wasn't the swing shift yet so we actually received prompt service, we got seated after a 2 minute wait.  Our server met with us right away asking us for drinks and handing us menus.  At this point it was near 10 PM so I barely grazed over its contents. Guess where I ended up at?

*Turkey Club ($8.99) - Triple stack sandwich with thinly sliced turkey, bacon, cheese (I went with cheddar), lettuce, tomato & mayo on your choice of bread (think I went sourdough this time around)

Sandwich only comes with fries!  If you wanted a house salad, Caesar salad, or bowl of soup you had to add an additional $2.99.  What a rip!  Yay fries!  Take that you carb lovers, you.

Didn't take too long for our order to come out from the kitchen, 20 minutes or so.  Figured it might have been quicker since the café was near ghost town empty.  I had to say, it looked pretty impressive on that big plate.

Turkey Club was fairly large, a nice triple layer sandwich with all the fixings.  A good serving of sliced turkey (cold cuts), actually crisp, thick bacon, nice slices of cheddar, fresh lettuce & tomato.  I actually couldn't wait to bite in!  And when I did, ugh!  They forgot to add the mayo!  Dry as a brillo pad!  After asking for a side of mayo and slathering it on each quarter, my club began to resemble more of a sandwich.  Overall it wasn't half bad!  Bread was toasted just right, provided great texture with the fresh veggies.  Bacon added some much needed fat (which equals taste).  It was a good sandwich.  Not the best club sandwich I've had, but surprising for where we actually were.  Fries were good too, cooked well-done just the way I like them.

Best part about the deal was the price, $8.99 is a decent value for a restaurant club sandwich.  I only managed to eat 3/4 of it so I had another quarter to box up and take home.  Midnight snacking!

I know most of these Grand Café places in Station Casinos don't get a good rep, and for probably good reason.  This one isn't so bad so I'll go with an average 3 stars.  I might actually come back here for another Turkey Club sandwich!  Maybe.  If I don't win at bingo.  Or at slots.  Or at blackjack.

{"text":"I really can't find fault with the Grand Cafe! My most recent trip was for breakfast, and though we had missed out on the graveyard cutoff of 6am, we hung in! Yes, when you see that most of the breakfast dishes are in the $10 range, it scares you off in Vegas! I mean this town is notorious for getting breakfast for half that price! I ordered the pancakes that comes with three eggs and bacon or sausage. The pancakes were as large as the plate with no exaggeration! And there were four of them! They were as tasty as any I'd ever had! The eggs were cooked as ordered and I couldn't complain about four strips of bacon either! We also got the All American breakfast, which consisted of three eggs, four bacon strips, hash browns, and our favorite, sourdough toast! The portions are large, tasty, and shareable with our kids to save a buck! This southern gentleman still threw away some leftovers!"}
{"text":"Ugh, this has been my worst experience EVER at the Grand Cafe. Something must be wrong today but no one wants to say......

I usually enjoy my time spent here but not this evening. First I chose to sit at the counter, for 15 minutes (no exaggeration) I waited to order. No big deal I'll look at my FAcebook while I wait. AFTER I gave the waiter my order (steak & eggs - rare steak, over easy eggs.) I waited 25 minutes (no exaggeration again) I guess they wanted me give me time to play words with friends  finally when my meal comes, the steak is cooked medium and the eggs apparently had to wait for the steak because it was a little cold. So I advised (not complaining, because you're never complaining when you point out that your meal was not cooked to order) them that my steak was medium well and not rare. Well of course they took care of the issue and would correct the problem............... 2 0 M I N U T E S later, I still do not have my order, however the manager came out and said they will be comp-ing my dinner tonight because of the delay and mistake. In my usual sarcastic self I said, \"what did you guys have to do, kill the cow and raise the chicken?\" 

Now it's not normally like this here, however the manager explained that because of their 2for1 chicken  special that they were very busy (which they were) and somehow my order made its way to the back of the grill I guess?!? 

Anyway FINALLY, my order made it out and it was just how I wanted it. Originally I thought I was on an episode of Hells Kitchen, or I was being Punk'd and testing my patience, BUT thank God for the smart phone  to keep me occupied. I know things happen and I appreciate them acknowledging it.

As I said normally they're really on top of there stuff...not today and I've now learned, unless you're ordering the chicken special... DON'T come in to eat...."}
{"text":"After Mother's Day dinner we were leaving Green Valley Ranch and know how good the Grand Cafes pastries are so took it home with us. This location is very large and even last night the pastry counter was really busy . Everyone wanting a tasty treat to share with mom. When the cashier recognized that it was our turn she was very pleasant and friendly. She was very professional and properly handled the delicate pasties, individually wrapping each one. 

When we got home it was time for our pastries. They all made it home safe and sound. We took home some of everything which features a brownies, choc covered strawberries, an eclair, coffee and cream cups, and tiramisu brownies bites. There was nothing bad to say about any of them. The best of the bunch was the coffee and cream cups. When you get done with the whipped cream and mix inside the cup, then you eat the chocolate cup."}
{"text":"My experience was fantastic.  The service was great, the food was good, and I felt like I got a really good deal.  I ordered a lunch special, it was less than $9 for the meal! If I were in LA or SF, I would have expected to pay at least $25 for my meal. The food was pretty darn tasty.  I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to grand cafe at least 18 times as my check ins advised me lol

They cater to seniors and the service and food has always reflected that IMO. I think that demographic can be hard to please but the staff does a good job. I've never had a long wait and I've also never had the same server more than a couple of times. I've also always had consistently good service with minimal wait time for food and prompt refills. When I want \"American\" comfort food I come here.

I usually get nachos, wings, chili cheese fries, or one of their soups to start. Their cream of mushroom and clam chowder are surprisingly good.

I usually get prime rib 11.99 or the chicken fried steak for an entree. The dinner 9.99 or breakfast 7.99/8.99 version are both delicious. One comes with eggs and hash browns and the other comes with a veggie and a starch. Depending on when you go the prime rib can not be so good. I mean if it is late don't count on getting a medium when you want a medium. I think it's a great value if you go early.

Their sandwiches are all good also!

I love the prices and how consistent it is. 

I recommend this place to everyone for a go to solid place when you aren't trying to spend a lot of money. 

I recommend their mashed potatoes as a side with country gravy.

Also if your nice they'll let you have two starches if you don't like veggies."}
{"text":"We stayed the night at the GVR and had a $25 hook up at the Grand Cafe. That's a good thing because there was nothing grand about this place. I take that back. The restaurant is clean, the coffee was bold, and our server was okay. But the food was average, at best. I had a chicken sandwich, bowl of chili, toast w/peanut butter, and a coffee. Their chili was okay and the chicken sandwich was bland as heck. The highlight of my meal was the coffee and peanut butter toast. The good news...$25 of our meal was comped and we were eating again in the next couple of hours. Otherwise, I don't see myself coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"After spending all day at a tournament at the Texas Station, it was time for a tasty meal. On low energy we went to the Grand Cafe. There was a deal going on for $9.99 for a t-bone and baked potato. When the steak arrived it was cooked perfectly, with a wonderful flavor! The baked potato continued to fill me up as well.

The waiter was very kind, and continuously filled our waters up. They were great about splitting the bill as well. As for atmosphere, it was nothing out of the ordinary, but a typical cafe setting in a hotel. 

I would recommend this cafe to many that are trying to get a fast and well priced meal. With great service and short line, you are destined to have a great time!"}
{"text":"I guess Sunday morning breakfast rush caught them off guard. For two people there is a 25 minute wait. There are two vacant areas like the one in the picture. How about staffing correctly to provide better service to your customers!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially breakfast, cold beer, drink specials (right now it's the Bottomless Bloody Mary for $10), great service... Jerry is the bestest ever!  She will keep on top of your order and refills!  The place is clean and easy to get to if you go in the back (west side) of Santa Fe Casino. This is my 2nd visit and now that I found it there will be more."}
{"text":"I came here last night on a friend's invitation. They wanted help consuming food to fulfill their $20 credit for this particular casino restaurant, so being a nice guy, I agreed.

Server was nice and friendly. Probably the most positive part of the experience. No cleanliness issues or anything, and ambient music isn't too loud at all.

It felt like my friend's coffee took at least 5 minutes to arrive. I'm pretty sure service at the buffet would have been faster. Whether the server is being stretched or is just slow, don't expect a super fast meal here.

First food to come out was the shrimp cocktail, my friend's order. Let's just say I've seen better. Nothing all that wrong with the flavor, but the shrimp were definitely on the soft side. Also, they were small. Not the miniature size that you'll sometimes find in, say, a package of dried shrimp, but pretty dang small and unappealing.

The other two items arrived simultaneously. My order was the honey bbq boneless chicken wings, which I'll fully admit was a questionable call. However, I was anticipating more than heavily battered school cafeteria-quality meat doused in a ridiculous amount of mystery sauce. Guess I was wrong on that. At least there were some carrots and celery for me to dip in ranch and make myself feel a little bit better about the whole thing.

My friend's other order was the fish and chips. The fish were not too bad actually, with four huge fluffy pieces and a reasonable batter. My issue here was with the lackluster shoestring fries. I've had better from pretty much every fast food chain that I've tried. There was some crispiness, but there was little flavor and no imagination.

Per my review of my last visit here, the food and service time was not good and I was only keeping the rating up for some arcane reasons that I won't fall back on now. Even the 24/7 hours don't matter to me because I would rather take a few extra minutes to go to another always-open place in Henderson by the name of Henry's American Grill."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with a functional and serviceable lunch which, from the perspective of casino owners, fills bellies and gets people back to the tables or machines where they belong. It amuses me when reviewers hold these type of casual coffee shop restaurants to a gourmet standard.

i arrived at the Santa Fe Station Casino and Hotel at about 12:15 on 1/12 eager to begin my video poker adventures after a six hour flight.Famished after consuming Jet Blue dreck and playing for an hour, I chose this Grand Cafe for lunch.Menus were not presented promptly and the kitchen was inexplicably slow, turning a lunch that should have taken 40 minutes into an hour event......but who cares, I'm chilling on vacation.

My bacon cheddar burger arrived medium,as ordered.The meat was decent but I could have done without the limp lettuce and tomato which gave the burger a jarring \"Burger Kingy\" vibe.Stick those on the side, please! The accompanying shoestring fries were decent. They were tasty and not oily. The miniscule portion of cole slaw was, to be kind, not memorable.My female server was pleasant and attentive, offering me extra napkins just prior to me noticing that I needed them.

Look,,,,,,if you are in this casino and want a functional, serviceable and cheap lunch ($9.49 bacon cheddar burger and fries!), you need look no further than this Grand Cafe.

Or so I thought. I returned to Santa Fe Station the next day(1/13) because I love playing in their casino. I had lunch there, ordering a plain Caesar Salad ($7.99) in anticipation of a heavier dinner.I was very underwhelmed. It took a half hour for the salad to be brought to my table. When it came it was extremely dry. It consisted of a large plate of lettuce, a few croutons and no anchovies. It was like someone put a half-teaspoon of Cardini bottled dressing upon the lettuce. When my very nice female server asked how everything was I told her the coffee was good but that they had a problem with the kitchen, both with the slowness and the incompetent salad. She asked if I wanted to see the manager but I declined.I deducted a star because of this experience.

When I return tomorrow, I'm going to Capriotti's!!!!!"}
{"text":"To assist the uninitiated, the Grand Cafes, like this one at Green Valley Ranch Casino Resort & Spa, are the quick/casual restaurants in the Station-owned (\"locals\") casinos.Since I have been staying almost exclusively at the Station casino hotels during the last ten years, I'm very familiar with them since I eat there frequently as a matter of convenience.

On 12/10/16, I ordered the Prime Rib Special, which had been a staple item for me my past LV visits.The waiter was efficient but a little too cocky and over-familiar for my taste.This stood  out because, in my experience during this LV visit and others, the people who work in the Grand Cafes have been always very pleasant and nice.

The Prime Rib left a lot to be desired. I requested my usual medium rare, which should arrive with a pink exterior in the middle and more cooking along the edges. This Prime Rib was cooked through. It did not taste too fresh either.The Baked Potato beside it was overcooked and hard as a rock. The String Beans, on the other hand, were hard and hardly cooked at all.

The next day I ordered Poached Eggs over Corned Beef Hash. While the Corned Beef was generously portioned and good, the \"Poached\" Eggs were overcooked and tasted more like medium boiled eggs.

I fared better with the Caesar Salad and the \"Short Stack\" of Buttermilk Pancakes. The Caesar Salad was large portioned, fresh and topped with a delicious dressing.The Buttermilk Pancakes were airy and tasty. The Coffee that accompanied it was fair.

While my wait people were all very good, I want to single out Lorenzo. He was the most attentive and competent waiter on my entire trip.

FINAL TAKE: This Grand Cafe just needs better execution in the kitchen to earn a four. I will continue to eat there the next time I stay or play at GVR."}
{"text":"Slow seating. Plenty on of tables available. Waited 15 minutes to be approached...then 9 minutes for water.. another 6 minutes asked for order...2 breakfast specials ..waited another 22 minutes for food ..home fries and eggs cold. Couldn't complain as they only came back to give us the check...then waited 4 minutes to checkout..no one on line or at the register...ugh
Worse service here EVER."}
{"text":"Being a complete night owl, I've had my fair share of steak and egg specials (Tuscany, Red Rock, South Point, and of course, Sunset Station), and this one is definitely worth the drive. The service is pretty expected, but the size of entree and the preparation is what keeps me coming back. 

Don't ask why, but I always order hot chocolate, YUM."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices and the atmosphere is nice for a cafe service is ok but I don't expect much from a small cafe and food presentation is nice"}
{"text":"I have had hit and miss service at various Grand Cafes but based on my latest visit, the one at Texas Station gets 4 stars. It was getting late in the day in the office and I was hungry. I had a craving for corned beef hash. So before I left I turned to Yelp to find a place with good hash. Unfortunately all the good breakfast diners close right after lunch. I thought I would be stuck with canned hash fried at home. No bueno. Then on the way home I remembered Texas Station and the Grand Cafe. I checked the menu before being seated just to make sure that had what I wanted. They did. For $7.99 I got a big pile of hash fried to slightly crispy, a pile of hash browns also fried to crispy, three eggs cooked my way (over easy), and a couple pieces of wheat toast. Was it the best hash I've had? No. But it was good and I did not have to fix it. The staff was great. Friendly. Attentive. Quick. I got a good filling meal for an okay price. That works for me."}
{"text":"So the steak and shrimp special was good. The steak was flavorful and tender. The 1/2 chicken was tasty as well. We ordered a cup of soup, and it was super salty. We asked for a cup, and got a bowl which we were charged for. We watched our waitress carry the soup to two other tables and chat them up before it got to us, and it was a meager serving at that. When our entrees arrived, one of them had some grease on the side of the plate. So our waitress volunteered to run her hand across half the plate to remove it. 2 stars for the steak, and for the manager Allen who sought to make it right since my wife would not eat her entree after what she saw."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after the wait for the buffet was over 30 minutes. While, his meal was decent, he had breakfast, mine was disgusting. It was the worst spaghetti and meatballs I ever had. Do not order this. We also waited 40 minutes to get our food, which seems unacceptable. Our waitress never asked how our food was. We told the cashier it wasn't great, but she just rang us up, without really caring."}
{"text":"I really like coming here for their 'Value Skillet'. You get eggs, choice of meat, hash browns and toast. It is so inexpensive, only $3.99. You just can't beat the price. This time we came in the late afternoon, and a BLT sounded pretty good. I got mine on sourdough, and my husband chose the BBQ Bacon Burger, medium-rare.

The food arrived quickly. These portions are really big. The burger was perfectly done, and the bacon on the BLT was really crispy. The fries were nice and crispy as well, but I didn't like the cole slaw. It really had no flavor, and was pretty dry. 

For the amount of food you get for the price, this place is a good value."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Sunday morning about 9am. We only had to wait a couple of minutes to be seated for a party of 7. The food was really cheap, but the coffee was as much as a soda. $2.25 
I got their light breakfast which consisted of 2 eggs, 2 bacon, hash browns and 2 slices of toast for only $3.99!
Our waitress was very fast and nice. Plus you are able to use your boarding pass points towards your bill."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer in this cafe for the past 3 years n have never had a problem with the waiters or the food,  but for my surprise this September 28 me n my family were celebrating my birthday , we order our food n for 30 min my 1 yr old baby started to get fuzzy,  when suddenly the assistant manager name Mary approached my table n asked me to find a way to quiet down my baby because someone else complaint about my son.  I asked to see the manager but couldn't find him, I try calling them but its been a couple days ago n still no return call.   I feel like they have discriminate against my baby my family n me I'm pretty sure the did it because we r Hispanic , why do I think this the reason is that there was another white family but they were treated very respectful n in a timely matter. Or may be I miss the  sing where it says \" only whites\"."}
{"text":"Under staffed. Slow service. Waited over an hour for a sandwich and fries.
Update: The manager DJ stopped by the table and really made an effort to fix things. Thank you."}
{"text":"It looks like Stations Casinos brought back the Grand Cafe. I didn't have high expectations upon entering this place, since I remember the old Grand Cafe being pretty terrible.

First thing that I noticed was that they're really trying to emphasize better service. Staff is much more friendly and accommodating this time around, which is already an improvement. I never really expected to be greeted with smiling faces and a friendly welcome when I'm in the Boulder Station. I mean, c'mon, it's the Boulder Station. The Boulder Strip doesn't exactly scream with class. 

The menu did go through some minor tweaks, but it still contains the standard cafe fare, with $7.99 daily specials that come with soup or salad. They also  have some off-menu specials like a $3.99 skillet breakfast, $5.99 burger special, or $7.99 for a mountain of Rocky Road pancakes.  

For starters, we ordered some spinach & artichoke dip, served with pita bread. Wasn't too bad, seemed a little lighter than most spinach dips that I have had.

For the entrée, I ordered the potato crusted trout special, one of the Friday specials. It practically looked like a two rectangular hash browns with trout hiding inside. It wasn't too bad actually, especially for a $8 seafood dish.

They tout that their Kona coffee is freshly brewed and ground every 90-minutes, which got me interested in trying it out. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but it tasted good enough for me.

All in all, a decent experience. This is somewhere I'd go for lazy and cheap eating, when I'm not willing to make a drive anywhere to break the bank. It's decent food, but nothing to go out of the way for. It's a definite improvement over the old Grand Cafe, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Foods alright, service is good, but I was really unhappy with the bottomless Bloody Mary. I've never had such a lackluster Mary, it's like thick tomato juice and ice, all it is. $10 is really cheap and you get what you pay for, skip that, just have a meal."}
{"text":"Decent food and ambience but slow service. Takes over an hour just to get your meal. Skip it, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service.... go elsewhere!

Quality of the food wasn't bad but ladies and gentlemen you will have a few birthdays by the time the food comes out."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast this morning and all I can say is our experience was awful!    The atmosphere is great here, and there are a lot of TV's so my husband can watch some sports. We used to eat here frequently before Station casinos closed all of their cofee shops.  We were somewhat a large party, there were 8 of us plus our 2 kids.  The wait  for our food was a little bit longer then expected but it wasn't that bad, and we were enjoying family time.  Everything was going fine until our food came.  My husband and I had bacon and egss.  The menu stated it was 3 eggs.  We order our eggs \"country scramble\" so it's fresh cracked eggs.  When we asked the waitress if we had gotten 3 eggs she said \"that's what the computer says\".  Our hashbrowns were cold, and so were the kid's french fries.  Our toast was not buttered, and it came in these huge fancy metal baskets.  We had little dishes of rock hard butter all over the table.  It was so fun trying to spread it on cold toast!  My mom's sandwhich was supposed to have bacon and it had none.   We had 1 little dish of ketchup, and I asked for a bottle.  I was told they weren't allowed to give me a bottle of ketchup.  What!  So I have to spread ketchup on my shredded hasbrowns and eggs?  Yes I did!  So we finally called for a manager.  He was very kind and polite and actually mentioned that he was just sent there (to the Grand Cafe) to fix these kinds of problems.  That's nice to hear.  So maybe one day  this place will get their stuff together.  Too bad because I don't think I'll ever want to go back.   And I was told that the waitress is supposed to butter the toast.  Our waitress was rude and non-caring.  She never offered to do much about our food.  We had to ask for fresh fries, oh and the size of the fries is very tiny.  They come in this nice mini fry basket- but the size it like a Mcdonalds kids meal.  I think this place is trying to come off as some kind of high class coffee shop.  But get kinder wait staff!  And bring the food out hot.    

The best part was when we got our bill!  There was an added gratuity of $6.  This was the first time ever that I did not want to leave a tip.  After the waitresses attitude, and her laziness (didn't butter our toast) I was NOT leaving her anything.  The manager took it off, and he had no issues doing it."}
{"text":"We decided on the Grand Cafe because the line for the buffet was long and we only had an hour and 45 minutes until a movie.  BIG mistake.  After we had waited about 20 minutes for a waitress to appear, my husband and I ordered a couple of their $10 3-course meals and a kids meal .  Waited forever to get our salad...and then waited a significant amount of time for dinner, only to have mediocre, cold, small portioned food delivered. Our meals were about the same size as my daughters kids meal, and the buffet food is SO much fresher than our cafe food was.  Then our waitress disappeared again.  We'd see her randomly chatting at a couple of tables a ways from us, and try to flag her down, but she'd turn away any time we made eye contact. Finally got her, told her we needed our desserts that came with our meal to go and our check asap.  I went to stand in line to pay before she gave us our check because we'd watched the REALLY slow service there several times already as we ate.  We didn't get to our movie until the previews had already started.  I will never return to the cafe unless I'm locked in the building and cannot leave, and the buffet is closed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast cafe! Chicken and waffles are delicious  and the omlettes and eggs Benedict. Late night menu is delicious and cheap. Green Valley's cafe feels less like a typical casino cafe and therefore make a nice brunch location!"}
{"text":"Our server Paula was great. Me & my fiancé live in The District & we walked to GVR to check out the pool. On our way out, we decided to stop & have lunch. We ordered drinks & food, then we had to get back home to let the maintenance guy in so we kindly asked our server to pack up our food before it was brought out because we were in a hurry. She was so very sweet about it, which I really appreciated! I got a burger & my fiancé got the wings. They have delicious ranch btw! He said wings were good. My burger was \"meh\" at best. Not seasoned enough. Their peach bellini drink was soooo good! I would come back for that alone & to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This is GVR's version of the 24 hour coffee shop. The prices are reasonable, the portions no overwhelming, and the food pretty good. If the line at the buffet is out of control, walk around the corner, and you will almost never see a line. I should also mention the full bar. Worth a stop in. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Bad experience here just today.  Our server was so rude never come back here again.  Unreal."}
{"text":"Great value breakfast!! I've only been here for the $3.99 special with eggs, bacon, hash brown and toast. Delicious! Good service and quality food."}
{"text":"After watching Quija at the movie theatre. My friends and I was hungry.  So we went to the Grand Café.  The service was wonderful.   The food was also delicious.   I ordered the KBBQ burger and it was kinda big.  I couldn't finish it.   My other friend ordered the ice cream sundae,  he was shocked it was a big sundae, not a normal size one.   And we all stare at him to see if he could finish it and I was shocked he did.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"GRAND service, grander food. Huevos Rancheros is amazing!! And the Strawberry waffle is a MUST for all!!! Make sure you get whipped cream. YUM!!"}
{"text":"They have some great late night specials, two eggs, toast, potatoes for $1.99. what a deal. service has always been good even when they are busy and unlike gvr, they are open every night. food is good quality and tasty. and remember just because you are only paying $2 for meal, be generous to your server if they do a good job and take care of you."}
{"text":"Boulder Station (and the other Stations) got rid of Coco's and have brought back their \"Grand Cafes\". Look, Boulder Station is basically 5 minutes from where I live, so if I feel the need for a quick, cheap dinner on the fly - Boulder Station it is. Since BS brought back the old Grand Cafe I figured I might as well give it a go, along with my parents.

First off, the menu is basically the same old cafe menu you'll see anywhere. Breakfast (served 24-hours), main dishes, sandwiches, and desserts. Not a whole lot going on here, but hey, it's just a normal little cafe.

The service is far improved from Coco's. Whenever I went here in the past the hostess was rude, the waiters were mediocre, and you had to wave down people constantly to get refills or anything for that matter. Our waiter was a very nice guy, but he did not refill drinks and he did not come back to ask us how our meal was. He showed up at the beginning and he showed up at the end. It's just a good thing I wasn't super thirsty and only drank one glass of tea... speaking of the tea...

It was bland and it needs work. If you're going to serve tea, at least get it right. Mine and my mother's were too watery, too much ice. On to the food, my father ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet. It came out looking EXACTLY like the picture in the menu and my dad said it was really good. My mother and I ordered the $8.99 Prime Rib Special. My mom got french fries, I got mashed potatoes (mmm the gravy on the potatoes was delish!). The prime rib was cooked perfectly and it was BIIIIG. No skimping on their prime ribs here. It was served with veggies (meh) and au jus, as well as horseradish. 

So overall I'm pleased with the Grand Cafe and will return many times because it is so close, convenient, and hey, if my parents are going to pay the bill for a meal - I am down."}
{"text":"Late night specials are great. A bunch of things under $10. Service is always great and Daune is the best! Food isn't always consistent but more good than bad. Short stack is huge. All nighter burger add bacon, egg and cheese!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed to say the least, especially after reading the reviews prior to mine.  My husband and I both got the prime rib on the recommendation of the server.  My steak was just ok.  The baked potato seemed like it had been baked in the morning...very hard and dry.  The green beans were cold.  My husbands steak was medium rare...dry as can be and cold.  They were out of 3 different kinds of beers that they had on the menu which seemed odd for a Wednesday night?  I wanted one of the advertised .99$ margaritas and they were sold out of those as well.  It was disappointing.  Service was just ok.  Will not go back!"}
{"text":"We attempted to try the new Pasta Cucina at Texas Station, but at 9:10 p.m. it was closed for the evening.  (This is Vegas???).  Other than the fast food court, the Grand Cafe was the only game in town.

I didn't want to eat a lot, so I ordered the half roast beef combo with soup.  I could have had salad instead, but the blustery weather today chilled me to the bone.  The soup was split pea and was served in a very big cup, probably a bigger portion than a bowl would have been.  I didn't expect much, but it turned out to be EXCELLENT!  It was full of diced ham, not oversalted, thick and very filling.  The roast beef half-sandwich had four good-sized slices of rare beef, with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and a tiny cup of cole slaw.  Mayo is the default, so if you don't like it, be sure to tell the server!  Alas, there was no rye bread, so I got it on sourdough, which was firm enough to support the contents after I added the cole slaw, and not overly sour.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by my meal and enjoyed it.  For 5.99, I thought it was a pretty good deal.

My husband ordered the Chicken Parmigiana, which was the Thursday dinner special for 9.99.  It came with spaghetti and two large pieces of garlic bread.  He didn't want the spaghetti, but wasn't allowed to substitute anything on the special.  He enjoyed the chicken, which to me looked perfectly ordinary, but he's not picky.

The Grand Cafe at Red Rock is, of course, much more modern than this one, but it served the purpose pretty well."}
{"text":"Service is slow but I guess they catching our cow because my friend and I ordered tbone steak. Boy it was well worth it. Everything was delicious. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Far superior to the Coco's that it replaced, but still about 3 stars, I'd say.

High points: Excellent customer service. Friendly staff, very courteous and informative.

Low points: Nothing really LOW, per se, just average.

The prices seem a little high for average food, in my opinion. Cracked Egg is better, The Omelette House is better both with wider variety and better food for about the same price.  I paid $10 for an omelette, which most places are $8-$10, so it's on par, just not quite awesome enough to warrant $10 when other places are so much better. 

My boyfriend paid $10 for his short stack, eggs and bacon. That also seemed maybe a little high, but he was happy with it. We're assuming the prices are slightly higher due to it being inside a hotel.

I was happy with my food, too, overall. The toast was cold and not the sourdough I'd asked for, but the omelette was tasty.  Hashbrowns were unremarkable, a tad bland.

We had to wait 10 minutes before we were seated, as the hostess said the kitchen was backed up due to a large party.  Not a problem, we played some slots.  

The restaurant was 1/3 full when we were seated and we sat for 10 minutes before we got an \"I'll be right with you\" from our server, but she made up for it. It wasn't that big of a deal.

I'd return, keeping it in the mix of places we go to for breakfast. It might not be my first pick, but I'd happily eat here again."}
{"text":"I believe the server should have found the manager and taken my order off the bill. Eggs were not cooked enough, english muffin not toasted and tasted strange and hollandaise tasted strange also. Worse eggs benedict I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hubby, the kids, and I visited the Cafe at around 2:30pm so it wasn't busy at all. I saw signs advertising a $9.99 t-bone steak special and thought it looked good! We were sat right away and even though we had a stroller(son was sleeping) they accommodated us perfectly. I order OJ which was tropicana, not the nasty machine stuff you find in the casinos, hubby had raspberry iced tea, and daughter had apple juice. Which surprisingly for a casino they brought her juice in a cup with a lid! I ordered the t-bone special which comes with a baked potato, hubby had the sourdough turkey sandwich, and daughter had red velvet pancakes. 
T-bone- no flavor!!! It wasn't tender at all either. But for it being $9.99 it was edible. The baked potato was large!!!
Sourdough turkey-This was the winner hubby did good! He also added a caesar salad for only $1.99 and it was fresh and flavorful, not over dressed. 
Red velvet pancakes- I DID NOT like these however hubby and daughter did! 

We all left pretty full and our waiter Reul(sp?) was very attentive and funny so service definitely gave this place an extra star! It was a little odd a few employees talking rather loudly about how one didn't want to take tables although Reul already had 5 in the middle of the dining room...But that only made us think poor Reul this girl is trying to make him work harder! But honey if you're in the service industry the only way to make money is to take those tables!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the weekday breakfast. Hubby and I are exploring the casino buffets near our new home and this one was our first! We got our rewards membership card in order to get a couple bucks off the buffet and to hopefully receive coupons for the future. 

The spread they offered was pretty darn good as far as selection goes! There were two omelette stations, scrambled eggs (with lots of toppings such as sour cream, salsa, cheese, etc.), pancakes, potatoes, bacon, sausage and two different kinds of breakfast pizza. I believe the soft serve machines were up and running and there was also a full salad bar that included fruit. 

One of my favorite items were the Rosemary potatoes because they had so much flavor!!

We'll definitely be back to this place again soon!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Grand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch.  Service is top notch, consistent and the food is excellent.  Particularly breakfast items.  They serve the best Denver Omlette."}
{"text":"Service was not bad however it is hard to see people who got seated after you get waited on before you.  Once we ordered the food came out fast and was good."}
{"text":"I had a good experience. Service was good and they kept asking to refill our beverages. I ordered the clubhouse and it was delicious. I also ordered a ceasar salad, which was the best Caesar salad I've ever eaten. No complaints about this restaurant."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely terrible...sitting there at 3am with no one in there and it takes 20 mins for someone to talk to us..The staff should be removed from this restaurant! horrible..I will warn anyone that tries to go there."}
{"text":"Meat done wrong, cold food, slow service, very busy tho"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. I had the french toast and it was way under cooked. I don't like sending food back (the movie WAITING!!!) so I ate would I could.

The service was good. No issues there.

Another downside is that they allow smoking at the sit down bar that is inside the restaurant. Some selfish fat pig was toking on a thick, gross cigar. Of course, he waited until I started to eat. When I asked the waitress how they could allow it, she was very sympathetic and in fact, I heard her relay my comment to the manager. Not sure what happened next, I left."}
{"text":"If you come and have the serve name suzi LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!! Absolutely horrible and ridiculous. We have been waiting for about 40 minutes and still no food. The table behind us got here after us, ordered, got to go boxes and left before our food even arrived!!! Ridiculous"}
{"text":"When Station Casinos says they love locals, they back up their words with their  \"Dig into these Great Deals\" promotion book. Today I dug into the $10 off a check adding up to $20 or more in the Sunset Station Grand Cafe. 

  With the exception of a few years as a Coco's Cafe in the late 2000's, Grand Cafe has been the signature cafe of Sunset Station. Going back to 2004, I have set eyes several times on the cafe's historic railroad locomotive. As far as setting eyes on the food, it's a different story. Since jumping on the Yelp locomotive in February 2011, I have only been to this Grand Cafe three times.

   A major reason that I have only been to the Sunset Grand Cafe three times in over five years is that in my opinion the food just isn't grand. My reviews of the Sante Fe Station and Green Valley Grand Cafe's support my opinion. From my experience, Grand Cafe is a solid cafe serving food all hours of the day and night that is neither outstanding nor bad. Today's visit was another solid meal in a Grand Cafe. 

   When I walked from the faux Mediterranean world that is Sunset Station into the Grand Cafe, I told the waitress table for one. She asked me if I wanted to sit at the counter. I declined to the detriment of waiting for a booth. Back in the faux Mediterranean world of Sunset Station near Starbuck's, time went by fast utilizing the complimentary Sunset Station Wi-Fi. The friendly hostess walked up to the bench before leading me across the grand-sized cafe to a two person booth nearer the kitchen door. From this point forward, Kelly took over as my Waitress. 

   The entree selection in the menu is anything but grand. To put it nicely, this ain't no Cheesecake Factory sized entree menu. However, when I looked at the breakfast, sandwich, and late night selection; there was a grand selection. Today I was in a unique situation to inflate my bill to around $20 in order to pay around $10 before tip. After Kelly's second trip to the table to place the glass of Pepsi on it, it was time to order. 

   I ordered the following: Dijon salmon entree with string beans and rice pilaf plus a bowl of house salad with Thousand Island dressing. The salad heavy on the croutons was a grand portion. The dijon salmon was too loaded with breadcrumbs. The overabundance of breadcrumbs spoiled the taste of the salmon. There was just too much breadcrumbs and a want of salmon. The two lemons were the wildcards that gave it some flavor. My picture below supports the fact that approximately 25 percent of the plate was the entree. This salmon trailed behind the one that Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo served me in March. The reality is that I enjoyed the rice pilaf more than the entree. 

   Now the NY steak dinner with scallops that I had back on February 28, 2014 during a week vacation of hiking was a better deal. Then again it was nothing to knock my socks off considering the fact that it was over two years that I returned here. Today my original choice was to order the steak. Unfortunately, they wouldn't have a baked potato until 4 PM. 

   When it was time to pay for the meal, the friendly hostess that greeted me took my money and coupon. There were zero hassles over accepting it. When all is said and done, this is a nice deal. Minus the coupon the dijon salmon ($12.99), house salad ($2.99), and bottomless Pepsi ($2.79) came out to $20.30 before the tip. Following the cupoun and adjusting tax all this added up to $9.48 before the tip. 

   I appreciate that Station Casinos shows the locals with their Great Deals Cupoun book. I am going to reciprocate that love with a solid rating, return visits to the host casino, and conceivable return visits to the Sunset Station Grand Cafe."}

   For whatever reason, on Saturday night Santa Fe Station closes the Feast Buffet at 9 P.M. It was 8:50 P.M., on a Saturday night, and I wanted to reward myself with a nice dinner. With the Feast Buffet closing, I stepped into another Station Casinos icon: The Grand Cafe. Unfortunately nothing about it is Grand.

  The Grand Cafe of today trails behind the Grand Cafe of a few years past in value. With the exception of their daily special, the prices are inflated. Gone are the entrees that include a cup of soup. My dinner: fettuccine, bread, cream of mushroom soup, cola, and tip came to $17. For that price, I would prefer Olive Garden or Red Lobster. 

  There were a couple issues that caused me to lower the review by half a star. Far too much of the fettuccine was taken up by bread. Attention to beverage refills was slow.

  My impression of the Grand Cafe is it is a convenient 24 hour restaurant to grab a bite in Santa Fe Station. And, if I am not mistaken, Grand Cafe is the go-to place for desserts in Santa Fe Station.

 These are my recommendations for the Grand Cafe management to improve their restaurant. Offer more items, lower the pricing, include soup with all entrees, and provide better refill service on beverages."}
{"text":"Grand Cafe? A Grand price for mediocre food. 

 I have to say that I was disappointed with the cream of mushroom soup,spaghetti with meatballs, and Pepsi. First off, I believe with a strong conviction that Grand Cafe ought to include a soup of the day or salad with the meal. This isn't the Las Vegas Strip! And if the soup or salad is $3, I feel ripped off considering that the Cream of Mushroom soup included zero mushrooms. Coincidental this soup tasted and looked similar to the Progresso Cream of Mushroom soup that was recently reintroduced to the Las Vegas market. A soup  that once had mushrooms in the broth. Fast forward to the spaghetti with meatballs. It is impossible to ruin spaghetti, but Grand Cafe came close with the meatballs. It wasn't cold or anything. Just below average. A significant portion of the plate was taken up by garlic bread. In my opinion garlic bread is filler. And the Pepsi was too syrupy.

  The service was decent. Nothing grand and nothing negative.

   The deal is that what I ordered at Grand Cafe was not worthy of $20. I could of dined in Red Lobster for that price. If I do return, I intend to stick to a sandwich with fries. The bottom line is that Station Casinos should bring back the value of their old Grand Cafe."}
{"text":"Terrible service today . Lunchtime not many tables. Waiter seemed confused with our order , a sandwich, salad, and soup , really? Then we added on a takeout sandwich for mom and it really did him in. 45 minutes later it arrived when we ordered it with our lunch . Two glasses of water arrived at the end of the meal , taking any enjoyment completely away due to excessive thirst ...wow what happened?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night around 9PM and were seated immediately.  It was very dead, we saw a total of about 5 tables in the entire restaurant with people already eating. Waited about 10-15 minutes and nobody came to even ask for our drinks (by this time we'd even decided what we wanted to eat so we closed our menus and looked around hoping to make eye contact with someone). A few waitress came to the tables eating but we couldn't get their attention because they were sitting further away. We shouldn't have to get someone's attention for our drinks and food anyway!  Very poor service. Walked out and left and told the hostess up front who seated us that we'd been waiting and nobody came to take our order or drinks."}
{"text":"I come here often and grace was the waitress who took our order us was horrible. Miss took two out of four of our orders and we all finished before the fourth order had come out then she offered us ketchup and didn't even bring it I had to ask again and when we had finished our drinks no one came to offer us a refill we had to call them from across the room and ask for them because she kept on walking by and ignoring us."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak!  If you like chicken fried steak, this is the place. I have tried chicken fried steak all over Las Vegas and nobody can compare with the Grand Cafe at any of the Station's casinos hotels. The chicken fried steak is fresh and hand battered. It is not  prefrozen like everyone else and it is large!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. We went here around 1am. We ordered steak and eggs. The place is pretty dead! There were only us and about 3 more tables. There was 5 of us. 3 of us ordered medium well, and 2 ordered well done. Food took about 40 minutes to arrive!!! Waitress never came back to refill our drinks, nor asked how's the food. Steak is very hard and very bland!!!! I only ate half of my steak.  i enjoyed eating the eggs and the toast more! Never coming back here!"}
{"text":"Grand Cafe made for a very nice place to wait for a movie at Sunset Station. Service is pleasant and efficient, and the portion sizes are a little more than expected without being excessive. The shrimp cocktail may seem pricey until they set it down on the table and you see they packed it with shrimp. Want a steak? I didn't need a steak knife, I only needed my fork as it was cooked exactly the way I requested it. Their menu offers something for everyone so if you're with a group of people who can't make up their mind on what they want, Grand Cafe can help with that. 

Overall I was very pleased with Grand Cafe and will be going back again."}
{"text":"Prior to entering, I noticed the large display case featuring pink bakery good in support of breast cancer awareness month.  I was surprised when we entered this coffee shop at its large size.  Seating accommodations include numerous booths and tables plus a large counter.  We chose the latter in order to facilitate our desire for separate checks in order to use a pair of Las Vegas Advisor $5 off a $10 purchase coupons.  We each ordered the bananas Foster French toast, a house specialty.  In order to meet our purchase requirement, my wife ordered a coffee while I requested a fruit cup.  The French toast was good, but the whipped cream topping was a bit excessive and the accompanying sauce was completely devoid of any rum or banana liqueur flavor.  Service was very good and everyone from the cashier to the manager was friendly.  

A rating of 2.5 would be most appropriate."}
{"text":"I won a $5 gift certificate in a promotion so prior to exiting the casino, I stopped and purchased a pair of almond crème croissants that were fresh, but not as buttery or flavorful as one would expect.  On our second visit we dined in with my wife ordering a Mediterranean frittata while I chose eggs Benedict that were accompanied by what must have been a pound of hash browns. We overheard a waitress telling a customer that the kitchen was shorthanded and that the executive chef was actually doing the cooking.  That may explain why my wife's fritatta was runny and the Hollandaise sauce was almost devoid of flavor."}
{"text":"As many times as I have strolled past this coffee shop, I almost never see many of the tables occupied.  I may have discovered why on this trip.  I stopped in and purchased a pair of relatively small apple fritters to take back to our room. These turned out to be flavorless and slightly stale."}
{"text":"Located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino, the Grand Cafe offers a full bar and 24/7 dining options. The menu is pretty basic with the usual cafe offerings like eggs, sandwiches, and burgers. Price is not exactly cheap diner, but not too expensive either. The portion size is good though. The service was not good though. Waiter asked what I  wanted for drinks and I ordered water and coffee. About 10 minutes go by and the server walks by with no acknowledgement. I asked if I could get water at least and she said, \"Oh, ok.\" Comes back still even later with the water leaves again just was I was saying I'm ready to order. Awkward. Some time goes by and she takes the order. Ordered the pancakes, wings and omelette. Rushes off as I was saying if I could get ranch on the side. I'm not sure if she even heard me, but I don't believe in chasing people down in public eateries. Food comes out slow, but it was pretty good. Pancakes were huge. Too bad service could use some improvements because I would come here more often, but there are other options in the area for late night food."}
{"text":"Yum! Very satisfying breakfast. It was a huge portion, every but was delicious and the wait staff was very polite and attentive. I had the All American pancake breakfast and let me tell you... It was delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times.  The food is very good and the service is always great. We actually live much closer to Green Valley Station but can't justify the higher price of their food. For those who don't want to trek through a smoky casino to eat the restaurant is better situated to parking at Sunset."}
{"text":"Had to update my review and add another star. After my previous review and complaint directly to the restaurant I was offered a free dinner. I didn't take advantage of it because my reason for complaining is to make an establishment aware there is a problem, not to get a free meal out of it. 

My husband, a friend, and I stopped in after a concert one night. Mainly due to the fact that most of the other restaurants were no longer open. We all ordered the hamburger special which I believe was 2.99 and is not on the menu. This is an all day special but you do need to order a drink with it.

This time the service was great and the food was very good. Everyone's burgers came out cooked to order (we were all over the board, rare, medium, and well) at the same time and at an appropriate temp. The waiter checked on us several times and brought out the requested condiments quickly.

Based on this most recent experience I will definately be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this café off and on for years. They have done recent improvements to their menu and they are worth checking out if you want some traditional diner food.

The Station Cafes have seen good days and bad days. Heck, at one point they changed them all to Cocos (that was the worst of days), and I'm happy to report they have steadily been going back up hill.

They have added some new things to the menu like Loco Moco and a killer chicken cordon blue sandwich. They have one of the best Cobb Salads I know of (they make their own creamy French dressing for it), and their prime rib is relatively low priced and consistently good. They are running specials now at all times, like Steak and Shrimp for $10, Cheeseburger and fries for $6, etc. The specials also now come with a soft drink so they are a pretty good deal. If you are a later night or early morning person they usually have some very low priced graveyard specials that run from midnight to 6am.

One thing that this place has always has is very good service. Their servers have always been very friendly and I have family members that come here mainly for that reason. They also have very reasonable prices.

If you haven't been here in a while, I would recommend coming back and trying their food again. If you are in the area and feel like a café or diner, this place is worth trying."}
{"text":"Only thing I ever had here was the prime rib which delicious for the price of $11.99. Their cream of mushroom soup is also very delicious. Sometimes the prime rib is inconsistent sometimes it's dry or too salty. This cafe has really bad signal for cell phones. One to no bars at best.  Servers are nice and attentive. Overall, a good joint for some prime rib."}
{"text":"Every time I come here on the late night it gets worse and worse so I'm over it. I timed it this Tuesday nite, it took 17 minutes to order and after 42 minutes passed and I did not have my pancakes I bailed. I would expect them to staff a little better. An hour for 2 pancakes hahahah wtf...peace good luck folks."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. The breakfast is amazing. Will definitely return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Great variety and always open. Great staple for all types of food. Perfect for groups of people who cannot decide what they want and is cheap."}
{"text":"*** PROS ***
* Open 24 hours a day
* Conveniently located inside Santa Fe Station Casino
* Good food! We had eggs benedict, ham & cheese omelet, kids' scramble and kids' pancakes. 
* Keno available
*** CONS ***
* Service was a bit slow, approx. 45 minutes to be served. Made us a little late for our day's plans."}
{"text":"I felt very unwelcome here. The hostess barely made eye contact and looked annoyed. She even handed me the menus instead of walking me to my seat. Then I waited for a while before any server would acknowledge me. I waved to one waiter who was standing around and he waved back at me and smiled before walking away. Then I left."}
{"text":"This was our favorite cafe for a long time, we were regulars.
The food is good and the hostess Lena is amazing and very helpful.
We were not very happy with our server Olympia she was a bit rude, she quickly set the mood for our dine in experience which wasn't a very pleasant one. I just felt like getting up and leaving but decided to give her a chance.
We were there for a graveyard special and were very disappointed when she failed to tell us what they were, she instead was quick to shut us down when we asked if certain things were part of the graveyard deal.
We didn't stay very long just rushed through our meal and quickly tried to leave. We did mention to the cashier that we weren't to happy with the service.
I would have given it a 4 or 5 star if it weren't for Olympia.
If you ever go there don't get Olympia as your server ask for someone else!"}
{"text":"Wow,  what a let down.  We were trying to decide whether to go buffet or the cafe and the cafe won!  Less busy, more intimate, less crowded, good burgers, meatloaf and etc!

The host/hostess - Very nice, quick and friendly. They get you seated asap.  That is cool.

The wait staff - We had a very friendly wait staff. Quick to welcome us and to get our drinks ready.

The food choices - Appetizers, steaks, salads, meatloaf, burgers, all the comfort foods!

We had the Meatloaf, the New York Steak and the Chinese Chicken Salad.  The meatloaf was very decent served with mash potatoes and green beans. The green beans were nothing special or exciting.  The mashed potatoes were okay.  The NY Strip steak we ordered medium rare and it came out frankly very poor.  Cold on inside and very tough to cut and even worse to chew. It was raw.  I am a huge fan of having the meat \"blue\" more than rare, and only when it is tender and melts in your mouth. This was simply a poorly cooked steak. They did replace it with a newly cooked steak and that was top notch and the second steak was very decent. The Chinese Chicken Salad was good, just a bit uninspired. Cabbage, Spinach, Mandarin oranges, and some other bits. 

The big 2 - The reason for the big 2 is how they handle things here.  IT took us about 5 minutes to flag down the waiter to let them know that the steak was totally bad.  We mentioned we could not even cut it and we needed a sharper steak knife.  The answer was \"The Steak Knives here are dull\".  It took another 20+ minutes to get the new steak, and I was impressed they delivered a new steak.  It was better. When it came time to ask for a take home box, that took literally another 10-15 minutes as the waiter forgot.  We did get refills on our water, never asked for more ice tea or another wine...

Another reason for the 2 is the fact that the design of the cafe is poor.  The smoke from the gamblers drifts directly into the dining room and this is not very fun to eat or sit and talk in this environment.

GK says, not bad, had plenty better and someone may have to drag me to come back here....."}
{"text":"If I could paint a picture of how my experience was with this cafe, it would be, \"meh\". Not like a bad meh or a bummed out meh, just a slight shoulder shrug indifferent \"meh\". 

I chose this place because I was at a work conference in this hotel. I wasn't starving but I was hungry enough that eating a box of triscuits for dinner just didn't sound like it would do the trick. So, I called this place that was close enough to my hotel room to justify leaving it. They hands down get 5 stars for convenience. I called, ordered, and was able to walk down to a ready made order in less than 10 minutes. 

I got the \"kitchen sink\" salad, shrimp and tomatoes and other stuff with \"spicy\" horseradish dressing.I say \"spicy\" because the spice of this dressing was similar to that of a ranch dressing. Not even buttermilk ranch, just plain old\"meh this isn't spicy at all\" ranch. I want to emphasize, nothing tasted BAD, it just didn't taste good. 

Then the apple of my eye, the chocolate cream puff. Even after they put it in a too small box it still looked beautiful! I HAD to have it...until I started eating it. I wanted to want it so bad...but a few bites in my body was like, \"is this worth it\" and I was like\"nah fam it isn't\". Again, not bad by any means, just not great.

Overall, I certainly wouldn't say to avoid this restaurant, the service I got, while short, was fine, and so was the food. But, that's also why I can't suggest you go out of your way to come here, since it's just fine, unless you need a simple meal fast and/or late at night while staying at this hotel."}
{"text":"My wife and I weren't feeling like going to our usual breakfast places so we cruised over to Sunset Station and decided to throw some money away at a casino cafe breakfast.  I was pleasantly suprised.  This place was cheap.  I got Chicken Fried Steak for $7.99.  Not bad either and it came out on a pizza platter.  I'm a strong believer that if food comes out on a platter it's pretty much a win-win right away.  The service was 'Blah' but for what I was expecting, the food was great.  And they have a pretty solid list of pies which is a plus."}
{"text":"Went there and had the chili-burger. To start...... Slow getting seated .......sat at a booth just inside cafe....... looked over and the plant shelf/ decoration area that was eye level had thick dust on it..... I took a pic....... gross...... hadn't been wiped down for some time.Ordered a salad which was OK. Chili burger had some crap chili on it that could not have been home-made. Chili tasted old and BLAH! French fries were about the cheapest fries you could get.Waiter was ok.... I could tell he was trying but he seemed extremely pressed. I won't be back...... even though we had a coupon."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here while visiting the casino. It was very good, great service, but pricey. They do have a buffet here at a different place that's much cheaper. We would return, it's recommended."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance went out for midnight steak and eggs today. We love going out to eat it every now and then, unfortunately we're never coming back here. We've been here a few times before but this time was ridiculous. 

We made our order, about 40 minutes of waiting our waitress came (before that waitress didn't pay too much attention to us) to let us know our food will be out shortly. Normally they don't take so long, but I thought hey if she said soon alright. It got to the point where I started doodling on the keno paper.  On top of that, we saw other customers receive their food first when they came wayyyy after us.  They made us wait for almost an hour. We got up and left, almost halfway from the restaurant the hostess ran and said our food finally came out. I was way too irritated to go back, I told the hostess not to apologize because it's not her fault that we'd be taking our leave. Thanks for the water? Haha not."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. After being seated we weren't acknowledged for around 10 minutes. Once we were acknowledged we ordered food and the server promptly ran away when we had yet to order beverages. 
We had asked what a sauza sunrise was and two separate servers had no clue. After ordering, neither of us were carded, I don't take any offense. However I do look like I'm 15 so potentially the man could have served a minor. 
I can understand if they had been busy but it must have been a staffing issue. All around it was a rotten experience and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go particularly late at night.  The food is not great, but it is not bad either.  For after 10pm, it's good enough and inexpensive enough.  Also, it has a nice and relaxing interior and friendly service. So in short...good enough!"}
{"text":"Well, in typical diner fashion, service was slow--had to ask another waitress who are server was--There is not really a sense of urgency amongst any of the staff.

Two tables next to me had food sent back and talked with manager. 

Food was typical breakfast diner food, slight step up from a Denny's. 

Go into it with no expectations of excellence and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"The Grand Cafe has your typical diner food. It's not world class, but if your looking for something cheap, tasty and consistent this is the place.

They have a wide range of items from breakfast, salad's, sandwiches and even dinner entrees. Everything is pretty much under $10 per person which is nice and they are open 24 hours. The service can be a bit slow. So if you are in a hurry you might want to rethink stopping here. 

The thing that I like best when going here for breakfast are the huevos rancheros. They are excellent!! The tortillas are crisp and the eggs are perfectly runny. 

I've most often been to the Cafe for lunch with my Dad. I switch around what I get so here is a little run down of what I've liked. I used to love, love, love the Cobb Salad, but they have changed it. Instead of leaving me to add the dressing they all of a sudden started mixing to together. This made the salad very wet and leaky! On the other hand it did taste good and was huge! I most recently got the Turkey club (no bacon) add avocado. If you want cheese you have to ask for it on this sandwich. It's a classic club sandwich and the rye bread is a bit bland. My Dad always gets their shrimp cocktail. For $4.99 it's a great deal. Packed to the brim with yummy shrimp! 

If you need a place that will satisfy everyone in your group at a reasonable price I'd give the Grand Cafe a go! Just make sure you have enough time because you will have to wait. Wait to be seated and wait to get your food."}
{"text":"My Fiance' and I are regulars here. We love the NIGHT Crew.. James the bus boy is Super Fab and the Ladies on the night crew and Robert BUST their butts serving and making sure their customers are happy. I am NOT a Fan of the day shift.. They food is always served cold, UNLESS Robert is there, he gets your food out ASAP and its nice and hot they way it should be. The night crew after 10 pm shift those ladies do a great job from time you enter until the time you leave. Chicken fingers.. NOT a fan of.. they are TOO small , they need to look at a different Vendor for the chicken fingers they are size for children. Other then that its nice. Hawaiian supervisor lady is Great.."}
{"text":"My family recently wanted to have breakfast while we were out near Sunset Station, so we decided to give the Grand Cafe inside the casino hotel a try. The food was very good. I had the waffle special, my wife the chicken fried steak, and my children the pancakes. We all enjoyed our food, the only blow was the cost in the end, with tip breakfast was $40. That is a little much for breakfast for me. No matter how good it is. We probably won't be back for this reason, but if you are in the mood for a good breakfast and don't mind the price tag, then this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I see why this place gets poor reviews. In my years of eating at Station Casinos, this would be my FIRST ever RANT. We ordered the Wed blue plate special. The food was COLD and NOT hot! It took them over 30 minutes to remake it. And it was STILL COLD! The turkey tasted like rubber and the gravy was nasty! So instead of the manager giving us the meal for nothing since they fucked up twice, she gave us 20% off the meal. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??????? Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back and hope everything one reads this! By the way, one of my guests is an airline stewardess for Delta Airlines. She got treated like shit by the manager who more or less blew her off. UNACCEPTABLE!!!"}
{"text":"My MIL and GIL went to this and the MIL really liked their Prime Rib $9.99 special so off we went since we always drag her to things she's not too enthused about. 

I didn't feel like prime rib so I got the roasted lemon herb chicken. It was just OK and lacking really a lemon herb flavor but was juicy. The veggie mix and mashed potatoes were bland. I got a side wedge salad which was very fresh though and had good blue cheese dressing and bacon crumbles. 

The BF had a omelette which was pretty standard. Grandma had spaghetti and meatballs and said it  was good. I tried a bite of my MILs prime rib and it was pretty decent. Since it's a special it's just during dinner time 4-11pm. 

Prices are pretty fair diner prices, majority being $7.99. It's 24 hours so maybe might be good during late night drunk diner food. Early times when we went it was just a lot of old people. Haha. We were with old people though so makes sense. 

It's standard and nothing to make a trip for, but if you want just some diner food its better than CoCos/IHOP/Dennys."}
{"text":"I'm am glad I used my points to pay for this meal and not my money. I have so many I had to use them somehow and I was hungry and wound up here. Probably should have went to the oyster bar but I had nobody around to share with me. 

I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. Buffalo sandwich has barely any sauce so I had to ask for extra and the fries tasted like they were fries in old dirty grease :/. The chicken was crispy from a lack of saucw but the chicken was poorly seasoned and very bland. Breakfast I've had here has been pretty good so I guess we'll stick with that instead."}
{"text":"Went to have breakfast this morning. The host said about 15 min wait. We waited about 45 min and there were at least 10 empty tables in the restaurant.  My daughter ordered biscuits and gravy and the gravy was spoiled. How in the world can that happen? It was very bad. The manager gave us a discount but will never go there again   Our waiter was very nice but a little forgetful on coffee refills"}
{"text":"I ordered the Waffles after they were recommended by Joshua-Hi Joshua?He was an excellent waiter.He checked on us often&made sure we were okay.The other Entrees buffalo strips and Buffalo chicken sandwich were good as well.Each dish was well and below average priced.Plus we were able to use our boarding pass points to pay part of our meal.Ended up being a great deal.Great company and a great service never hurts to have a good meal anyway.Good Job Sunset Cafe.Bought a Pastry from the display case-it was fluffy,good and oh so sweet.Rich goodness doesnt get much better than this.I highly recommend patronising this establishment when in need of a good conversation, Inexpensive meal or just a good time.This is the place to be! 
P.S-The Manager Joe is a big flirt but oh so great-Make sure u hire Freddie,Joe! and goodluck Freddie,I'll B looking for you nxtime am here.Thanxs everyone for a greatime!"}

{"text":"We decided to try the Grand Cafe for dinner because 1) we were already at Boulder Station, and 2) they offered a T-bone Special for $9.99. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away. The T-bone was cooked exactly how I ordered it. My husband decided on the spinach and mushroom omelette. No complaints from him either. The service was quite good during our visit. No issues. Fast service, decent food, great price."}
{"text":"Pros: Very Nice Decor

Cons: Service depending on day. T-Bone Steak, dinner rolls

We ate here and ordered the T-Bone Steak. Ordered medium well and it came out BLOODY RED on half of steak and well done on the other half and tough as a used rubber tire. We also ordered the Turkey BLT which came out good. The dinner rolls were HARD as CONCRETE. And our waiter never brought out the Steak Sauce we requested. Yes this is a cafe at a local casino and you shouldn't expect a whole  lot but this place takes horrible food to another dimension."}
{"text":"I am re-reviewing this because I have been back to Grand Cafe three times since my initial review.  Don't ask me how we ended up there so many times... I don't really know.  Regardless, I have come to really enjoy this place.  Their chicken noodle soup is fantastic.  I always order a fruit cup off the breakfast menu.  It is served in a cute glass and the fruit is always cold and fresh.  Their meatloaf has gotten better too... it isn't nearly as bland, and they have changed the gravy a little bit.  I think they have just mixed in some ketchup into the gravy (judging by the taste of it), but that's a-okay with me... it appeals to my child-like sensibilities :)

Yes, they DO still have the weird heavy menus.  But hey, I figure that if I'm going to put on the old feedbag, I might as well do some serious weightlifting while I'm at it ;)"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.  Worst dining experience ever.

My fiance and I stood at the hostess' stand for nearly five minutes before the hostess decided to seat us.  Then we waited ten minutes for someone to take our drink order.  I ordered the roasted lemon herb chicken.  When it came, it was visibly incorrect - it had clearly been grilled and smelled like chemicals.  When I peeled the skin away, it seemed okay... so I ate a little bit.  Then I dug deeper.  To my absolute horror, the chicken gushed blood and the looked like jell-o.  It was RAW.  Of course, my waitress was nowhere to be found, so I found someone else to take it back to the kitchen and grab the manager.  Meanwhile, my fiance had a chicken fried steak.  It was cold and tough.  

Ten minutes went by and the manager still hadn't visited the table.  Worse yet, our waitress decided it was time to go home... and we weren't assigned another waitress.  We had to go find someone ourselves to get the check and have my meal taken off.  

I hunted down the manager, who was apologetic about the situation, but didn't offer any practical solutions to the situation.  She didn't seem to think it was a problem that the waitress had left work without reassigning the table, and she tried to defend the chef who made the chicken.  I couldn't believe it.  If you are out of something, fine.  Let me know and I'll pick something different.  Do NOT serve me something you pull out of the freezer and try to cook really, really quickly.  You could kill someone that way. 

I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Waited for a half hour and no waiter came to our table.  Finally just got up and left.  What a waste of time !  They do not care if you come or go.  Typical of any stations casino.  They just want your money."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably a pretty solid 3.5 stars. We stopped by for Mother's Day since the buffet had a 50 person wait line. We ordered a turkey club, an open faced hot turkey sandwich, 2 shrimp cocktails, endless mimosas and a double Jim Beam with a club soda back.

I think our server was new. As we waited about 10 minutes for our drinks I saw our server lose my mimosa from his tray. He wiped up the spill himself and brought a new mimosa with my husband's drink. My husband takes one sip of the club soda and finds that it's actually 7-Up. We wait a little longer and our sandwiches come out. The hubs says the turkey club is bland and boring, my open face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes is fantastic. I ate all of it.

Finally we attempt to flag down our server as I've only had 1 mimosa under the unlimited mimosa plan. A manager gets our drink order and our server shows up 10 minutes later saying he totally forgot about our shrimp cocktail. At this point I'm full and really don't want it anymore so we cancel the 2 cocktails. 

The open face turkey sandwich was the highlight of the meal whereas the forgetful, clumsy service was the low. Hopefully we get a better server next time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I was thinking the were discriminating but after I seen these reviews there just plain horrible! There service is the worst ever and they do not care probably because they get complaints all the time"}
{"text":"Decided on an early lunch with a friend, not too many people there so we were seated immediately. Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and it came out rather fast. I was not disappointed, the food was hot and was more than enough for one person. My plate was also full with fries wooo! The chicken sandwich my friend ordered was rather large, and her plate was also full of fries. When you're finished you do have to pay up front yourself. It would have been nice to know that, instead of waiting for the waitress to take your payment."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time for a quick bite to eat. It's local and they always have monthly promotional coupons if you have a preferred casino card. The late night menu is a great deal and they serve breakfast 24 hours which is ALWAYS a plus! Great place to eat if you can't make up your mind.. They have plenty of options and it's not too pricey."}
{"text":"From the coffee to the bacon, totally delicious and the service is great!  Thank you Grand Cafe' for making my trip tasty at breakfast!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had! I went here around 2AM with a friend to eat after a night of gambling and our waitress was the WORST! She took our order and gave us our drinks and everything was fine. And that's it! She never came back! We waited for 30 minutes before I had to go up to the cashier and ask where our food and our waitress. Then a few minutes later than she came out with our food. It was COLD! Then she gave us our utensils and mines had dried up mustard all over the fork and knife! Then I asked our waitress if I can get new utensils and a refill. She never came back. I waited another 15 minutes and no one helped us. Yet the family that came after us got served in a timely matter. It got to the point where I had to go up to the cashier and request to speak to the manager. Then after arguing with the manager for 10 minutes THEN our waitress, with a terrified look on her face, got all our utensils, refills, condiments, etc. By this time its been an hour and I have not eaten at all! The food is cold and my friend was just sitting at the table trying to hail own any other waitress but to no success. Then our waitress was arguing with us that she got everything that we requested in a timely manner and there was no reason to complain to the manager. She was saying stuff like \"oh it's my first day here\" and \"oh we're very short staff\" just to save herself. First of all there were only 4 tables to serve. Secondly, If this is how you act on a first day of a job then you don't deserve a job PERIOD! I was so disgusted I didn't even bother to ask for her name but she was a short, chubby, Mexican woman with a \"I hate my life\" look on her face all night. Not being racist or anything as I am Mexican myself. Thankfully, the manager was able to assist us by not charging us for the meal. This was good to know that our wasted food was coming out of HER paycheck. In the end, it was a s*** experience and I advise all to go eat somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here staying at the Boulder Station Casino. With your pass you get a decent breakfast of 2 eggs, toast, hash browns and bacon and beverage for $3.99.   It's pretty hard to screw that up. It was good but l have had better hash browns. My husband had an omelette which was really tasty. Quick service and they give you a carafe of coffee which is nice and hot. Good deal, good food. Would recommend it if you don't want to go with the buffet."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! After being seated and not being greeted once by our server busser anyone for about five minutes my mom started coughing and choking. Two servers \bussers walked passed and she said excuse me, excuse me,EXCUSE ME! CAN I PLEASE GET A GLASS OF WATER NOW! THEY BOTH LOOKED BACK AT HER AND TURNED AND WALKED AWAY! Never acknowledged her or brought her some water? We got up and walked out not getting dinner, we took my boys to the arcade to play and my mom and I sat down at a machine to play, and the cocktail stood behind me talking to a lady for five minutes went and got HER a beer and then continued to talk for another ten minutes! Finally she came and asked us if we wanted something to drink so we ordered. It took another umpteen minutes to get pur drinks, by then we were done playing!!!! Never ever again will I go into sunset station for anything!"}
{"text":"When visiting Las Vegas you always look for the 24/7 cafes. Driving by, I spotted Boulder Station. I can remember playing Black Jack here years ago. The place seems like a place for locals.

The service was good, and the food wasn't bad at all. A large T-Bone with 3 Eggs just 13.99.

Not bad."}
{"text":"We had the best dinner tonight, fish and chips was great 4 large pieces cooked perfectly. However what made the experience outstanding was our waiter Christopher (I think) he was so nice and anticipated our needs, we never waited for drinks and the food came out quickly. He was just so nice, happy it really made our day. He made such an impression that asked the cashier to tell the manager how great he was, I never do that."}
{"text":"Jose the host was amazing! One other host walked right by me and As soon as Jose saw me he greeted me right away with a smile and recommended I try the steak. I am from Rosarito, México and he made me feel right at home, it's so nice to have someone to speak Spanish with. Thank you for the great job you did, I will continue to come back! Just not on Mondays and Tuesdays, you're the bomb Jose!"}
{"text":"4 star property 5 stars services.  Staff at the cafe are always friendly, food is yummers, always fresh and Delish. Fast service.  Prices are not bad either."}
{"text":"This is my THIRD time in a row coming here, ordering a milkshake and having my waitress down right try talking me out of ordering it. This time the waitress actually said they weren't any good and it wouldn't have much flavor but I could order it if I wanted and I DID. It was fine. She snarled throughout the whole process and I didn't appreciate it after having a long day of my own.

I'm a server and I know making milkshakes isn't the most fun especially if you're busy and you're making them by hand but again....I also do it for a living and I do it with a smile...at least to the customers face come on!!! The service is sub par to begin with (as clearly noted by other patrons) so to talk your way out of at least a decent tip, yuck."}
{"text":"There really was nothing redeeming about the entire time spent here...  The dinner started with me politely asking if we could have a table that was on the opposite side from the casino so I could avoid smoke (I was getting over the flu and the restaurant was EMPTY), so she proceeds to seat me at a table right by the railing.. ummm thanks. 

Moving on.. We decided to try the $12.99 special with included soup/salad, \"steak\", potato, fried shrimp, and pie. Stupid stupid stupid!

Waitress was slow, food took forever (again I remind you the place was empty). Chicken noodle soup was gross.. all celery and onions. The steak.. oh wow, I've never seen a more nasty piece of meat in my life, but ok that's to be expected. Moving on to the potato.. can you please cook it for more than 30 seconds so it's not cold and hard as a rock? Please?

Pie.. icey cold and basically just packaged gooey nasty pie. 

Bad service, bad food... don't waste your time. The food court is great.. and if you're in need of breakfast the service and food at Original Pancake House is great."}
{"text":"The prime rib special is great ! Have had it many times always have to take 1/2 of it home"}
{"text":"The manager, Jason, is busting his you know what while the other waiters and are slacking. He is managing 8 tables while they are taking care of 2 tables at most. I'm very unimpressed with the lack of respect they display toward their boss. 

Not to mention when we were initially seated we were ignored for 10 minutes. The servers had tunnel vision and refuse to make eye contact with you. It appears some customer service training needs to be emphasized here.

The food is pretty mediocre. The burger was ordered medium and is still dry. The fries are also over salted.

Overall: Will not return"}
{"text":"I was relaxing in my room looking over the specials, not in a hurry because restaurant advertises open 24/7.  Looking forward to an open face hot turkey sandwich (hard to find) NOT! NOT, OPEN? Closes from 7:00 pm to 6:00 am.... That's not cool! Talk to the hotel manager who calls the restaurant management who instructions us to the other restaurant, with limited menu. 
Which also is closed...I end up at Denny's."}
{"text":"Not the best food, but if you're looking for great - and I do mean great - service, this is the place to go!  They always have smiles on their faces and bend over backwards to make sure you know that they value you being there."}
{"text":"I've had good experience here with good food and great service. Why the 1star review? This the only grand cafe out of the Stations and does not allow you to use food vouchers printed from the kiosk or comps for their specials.  I came all the way here to redeem my coupon that was about to expire just to find out that I cannot use it and that I had to pay cash for it.

Last time coming here."}

Intrigued by not only the concept of 'locals' casinos, but more so by the early morning activity at such places, and twice impressed by the quality of the pancakes and pastries at Station Casinos Grand Café it was amidst Las Vegans and visitors that breakfast was enjoyed within the confines of Santa Fe Station and similar to its Strip adjacent brother and Red Rock location in Summerlin the breakfast fare was once again far superior to several more pricey competitors while the baked also proved by-and-large impressive shortly after emerging from the oven just after 6:30am.

Lengthy but narrow, with a sort of 'patio' overlooking the gaming floor adjacent to the well stocked pastry case, it was on the right side of the restaurant with a view of the television showing Sportscenter that I asked to be sat and greeted by a friendly Hispanic man just about to go off-shift water was quickly filled and a pair of pastries delivered, my order of entrees transferred to a middle-aged Caucasian fellow who seemed to take a minute to get his bearings at the beginning of his day.

Beginning with a simple donut, the $1.25 ring resembling those at Dunkin but not quite as soft in crumb, it seemed to me that while the baked goods were indeed fresh that this fried one might have been a bit old and moving on to the Blueberry Muffin a far better bite was found, the base quite buttery even before adding a little bit more while the top was speckled with pearls of sugar giving the whole thing a light crackle as several fresh berries burst in each bite.

Eventually flagging down my original server for a water refill, even though I'm rather sure he was off the clock, it was not long before entrees arrived from the fellow who seemed to have finally woken up and setting aside \"faple,\" as in fake maple, syrup in favor of the good stuff the pancakes again proved light and fluffy with light topping of whipped cream and fresh strawberries while the waffle, too, was quite admirable with a good crunch and soft center, the crisply fried breast of chicken perhaps a little more greasy than some would prefer, but at the same time a whole lot better in its hand-battered herbal flavor than the previously-frozen fingers served at 24/7 spots elsewhere.

Sated and happy, but also intrigued by a few novelties within the case of cupcakes and croissants, it was with two items boxed and bagged that I settled the tab and taking my leave to less smoky environs than the casino itself it was with coffee in hand that I partook in two chocolate concoctions that again proved quite pleasant, the rich double chocolate chip cookie with slivers of almonds rich and almost 'brownie-like' while the actual brownie was more like a slab of sheet cake with slick chocolate ganache and patriotic sprinkles that may not exactly justified the $4.50 tab, but would have been absolutely excellent warmed up beneath some ice cream as offered amongst the menu's desserts."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great service, great food and even some good oldies music  Grand Café is the spot. As a local I've been to plenty of diners and this is hands down our favorite. The specials they have are wonderful and you get a great selection from breakfast to sandwiches to chicken parmesan starting at I believe a couple bucks to under $10.00. WELL worth it! The waitresses and waiters are always welcoming and engaging which is always a plus. The food is delicious. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had anything on their menu that wasn't good. I definitely would recommend coming and trying it out because more than likely you'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great menu selections. Much nicer Grand Cafe than  the other Station Casinos. Service was great. Ambiance like a Cheesecake Factory. Cloth napkins and the wait staff remind you of a high end restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just needed a quick meal and chose this place on a whim. Good food. Good service. Simple and reliable. I was very happy with our visit and our waitress Amber."}
{"text":"Have not been to the \"new\" Grand Cafe since it's re-opening.  Originally (like 7 years ago), the prime rib sandwich was OUTSTANDING.  When it was close to the Cafe closure, they went with reheated cheaper cuts of meat and the sandwich was AWFUL.  We decided to give it a try under the re-opening.  Our server and boy I hope his name was Jonathan, was EXCELLENT.  Answered all questions about the prep of the meat and said if we were not happy, he would gladly get us something else.  The sandwich isn't as good as 7 yrs ago but was not awful like our last experience.  The dinner salad was HUGE...and we decided that when we go back we will share both the salad and the sandwich.....it was a lot of food.  Sure do wish they would really make a difference and go back to that original sandwich of 7 years ago!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here was certainly below the bar. The atmosphere is nice, but the taste of the food is, \"blah\". What really put me off was the fact that the creamer arrive to our table in a plastic drinking cup. Not idea for pouring or looks. I would avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"The food was good ad inexpensive. The service was a bit slow nut nothing too bad. The food was a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, glasses dirty,and silverware had waterspots.whe went for breakfast and told ourselves that you cannot ruin breakfast,we were wrong. The eggs were left under the lamps too long so they came out dry. Save your money go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I didn't eat inside the cafe but purchased a couple of pastries from the pastry case that is outside the restaurant.  Had walked past it a number of times and decided to get a couple of things.  Got a maple bar and a cheese danish.  I always have high hopes for pastry and always on the lookout for any place convenient to pick up some good breakfast pastry or sweet treats.  The service was good, very nice girl at the checkout, but unfortunately I was underwhelmed by the pastry, about the quality of grocery store. Prices okay.  Probably won't get anything else from there unless it really looks great. Makes me wonder what the quality of the food in the cafe is...mediocre?  If they're going to put a pastry case out front, then they should step it up and really make them stand out and not something I can get at Vons."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I felt sick after eating breakfast here today. The food was terrible. Even the coffee was terrible. I made a bad choice in going here. The pseudo ham that was served with my runny eggs and greasy hashbrowns was more like the texture of spam than ham. Her chicken fried steak meal was almost seen by several customers at a store in the mall!!  She felt very sick. Please Sunset!!  Improve!!  Read these reviews and get some pride!!"}
{"text":"When we first moved here I thought we were going to be coming here A LOT.  They have a ton of choices on the menu for each meal, you can get anything at any time of day, and they seemed to have great deals. 

We initially tried this place out for breakfast, assuming that it was going to be good homestyle food for a pretty good deal.  We were wrong.  The food was OK but the prices were just not reasonable for what this place is - a \"diner\".  It seems the good deals are only overnight and early in the morning and neither of us are early enough risers on our days off to partake.  

We also thought this was a little too smokey... I know we're in a casino but I hoped there would be some separation.  The restaurant is really open to the casino right outside of it and it was just a little too much smoke in the morning... 

There are so many places to grab food in Henderson that we decided it just wasn't worth it to come here.  I still like the location and the choices but, unless I'm already in the casino, I probably won't make it back too often."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on Christmas morning before I needed to head to work.  I can always count on the Grand Cafe as a good option when many other things in the area won't be open, or when the buffet line across the way is long and winding.  

This location as compared to the one in Sunset Station is a very comfortable atmosphere with nice decor. 

The service here is OK, not extraordinary but they get the job done.   The menu is adequate with options to suit everyone for all meals. 

The slightly high prices for just mediocre food is where I subtract stars.  My breakfast is always just OK.  My husband always mentions that he likes the cheesesteak a lot here and, having lived in Philly, I wonder if it's just because he hasn't had the real deal in a while, LOL.  

I usually get a coupon in the mail once a month for this place so I think it's the only time the meal is really worth it."}
{"text":"A little hard to find because they moved it. But DAMN is it nicer than ever. Great Service. Friendly knowledgeable servers. And the food is still tasty and the presentation is Awesome. No complaints because we were seated quickly. Our drinks came quickly and the server took our order quickly."}
{"text":"Man, I used to come here all the time after working out or getting drunk, and the fact that I was here last night and they raised the price and the portion got a LOT smaller than last time I was here like a month ago. It's kinda disappointing, I used to love to come here and spend the extra dollar here than south point. But not it's all the same. Damn it."}
{"text":"Poor service and poor food quality. We had to wait 20 mins for ketchup and then had to ask another waiter for it.  Food was cold by time we got ketchup. Hash browns were soggy and toast was burnt. Skip this place."}
{"text":"I went here with my date for dinner so we can watch a movie afterwards. I ordered the eggs benedict and he ordered the bleu cheeseburger. Our food came out fine. The hostess was charming. I haven't tried any of their specialties but as far as your good old fashioned comfort food/breakfast items, it's good. If you're looking for lot's of flavor and to be wow'd or impressed with the food and ambiance then go to a different place. If you're just looking to have a quick bite with no high expectations and to just kick back then this is the place to do so."}
{"text":"I have to say, for a 24 hour café, this place has some really amazing food! I've eaten here twice for lunch, both times at the bar. I love the menu, there are several healthy options which is not always the case. I've had the Energy Omelette and the Protein Breakfast Bowl, and both were healthy and delicious! My Dad had a Turkey BLT and a Reuben, and he loved both as well. He also had pancakes one morning and said they were great. Prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommend eating here if you are at Green Valley Ranch or in the area."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend at this cafe a couple days ago.  We were seated promptly and our waiter was at our table immediately serving drinks.  Since they seated us at a dark table, we moved ourselves to another table that had lights.  

After we placed our order, our food came out fairly quickly, and it was pretty good.  We both ordered breakfast items (eggs benedict, etc.).  What was odd is our waiter said his shift was over and another person would tend to us.  I tried to find him a minute later to tip him, but he ran out the door very swiftly.  And, no other waiter came to our table to ask if we wanted anything more, or to even pick up the money to pay for our meal.  There was 2 other waiters there but they didn't even pass our table once, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I left money on the table and left.  Not recommended.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and there was a waitress complaining about our placement and telling the manager that we were in her way. Except she is doing it in front of us. First strike. I asked the manager if he wanted paying customers to go elsewhere because we could- he said oh no, you're fine.  Then, the lady that complained about us, is now our waitress, Val. There was 10 of us. She took everyone's order but mine. Second strike. I ordered my food and it came out cold and undercooked. Third strike. I just asked for my eggs to be cooked, not runny. She said, oh, I see. She then comes back from the kitchen with an empty plate and takes my knife and scrapes the uncooked eggs off of my plate to take them into the kitchen to recook them. Fourth strike. I will never go back here- if this was the last place on earth. Very unprofessional from the beginning and it didn't get better until I left."}
{"text":"This was one the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We got seated quickly but we had a long wait for a server to come even just for coffee. Then the server brought the coffee and disappeared. Another server came and asked to take our order and at first I said no out of courtesy for our original server but seeing that she was gone we placed our order. I clearly stated what I wanted and after waiting another long period I got my breakfast without my sausage. The server went and got it. None of the servers were attentive to our needs. Normally they will walk by to see if you need anything but no one did. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"if you go after 1am,the chef,and waitress SUCK big time. They don't cook anything right,and she is a B****"}
{"text":"Not I'd friendly at all! No stars if I could! 
Poor service at the front, slow servers with attitude! What is happening to all the restaurants here in Vegas??? A lot of them need to take a hospitality class and wake up in the right side of the bed! So fed up with rude workers! Be thankful you have jobs and have a little pride with what you were hired to do!  If not...quit!
Management: your staff was incredibly rude to my family! Stations is def going down hill!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for dinner before a movie tonight. I remembered from before that it was pretty good, as we both didn't feel like traditional fast food.

When we first arrived we were greeted, and told that all they had were tables available. They did have half the restaurant closed off with a partition, so it was understandable that they didn't have available booths, although at prime dinner hour, why close half your dining room? 

Anyway, only tables available, my fiancé even asked \"so no booths at all?\" The hostess said no. Low and behold, when we are being shown to our table... We see empty booths! *grumble* imagine our surprise when a couple that was sat after us got seated at one of the empty booths!!

We ordered our food, Nachos to share, myself the philly sandwhich, my fiancé the fried chicken. The nachos were ok, nothing over the top to brag about. When our entrees came, my fiancé took a couple of bites of his chicken, and said it was bland, like they used old oil to try. It was way too crisp, and in some places burnt. My Philly was ok, bland as well, so I added a bit of salt and pepper. Don't exactly know why food was so flavorless, but I guess it's better than being over seasoned!

When our server Jessica came to check on us, my fiancé told her that he was not enjoying his chicken. Now on her part she did offer to replace his meal with something else, but we didn't have time, we had to get to a movie. But, at the end of the meal, my fiancé still had both pieces of chicken on his plate. No manager came to the table, no apology, nothing. When the bill came, low and behold my fiancés chicken was still on the bill! Nothing better than paying for something you didn't even eat!! I've been a restaurant manager for almost 10 years now, and that kind of handling of a customer complaint is appalling. I would never make a customer pay for something they didn't eat nor enjoy. 

When we paid at the counter my fiancé told the cashier (who was also the host who told us no booths were available) about our experience. In her favor, she asked if he would like a manager, but they would have to go find him/her. Wow, no manager on site. Maybe casinos do it differently, but again, a manager should always be available for help, or to do table touches, or handle guest complaints!

Needless to say, we won't be back to this location ever. Bland food, and obviously guest satisfaction isn't important. Get it together Grand Cafe!"}
{"text":"Service was the best part of the meal.  And it was not very good.  I did get the quality of food for what I paid.  The biscuits and gravy were pasty and very flavorless.  The hash browns were perfectly golden on one side and white and oily on the other.  The eggs were done well, but they could not save the meal.  Will only be back if I am very hungry and have NO transportation."}
{"text":"Service very slow. Food was gross ( blood dripping from beef sliders). Never saw waitress one time after food was dropped. When I asked for it to be removed from the bill she got very angry so I asked that the manager handle my table she got even more angry. So no food for me as it took so long to even get someone to see how bad food was. Oh well will not ever go back."}
{"text":"Simple menu, but not good for vegans! I don't eat dairy, pork, or red meat so their weren't many options for me but I ordered spicy chicken wings and I loved them! The price was great and portion was large compared to most wing orders. My boyfriend loved the meatloaf. The service was prompt and nice. Open 24hrs is a plus!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They take forever to get your order. 1st time - Took 10 minutes for the waitress to come over. 2nd time - No one came over after 10 minutes. Walked out.  3rd time - I thought I'd try it one more time after a year. Figured they would've gotten new management by then. Wrong! Same bad service. Walked out."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in North Las Vegas. They usually get me a table quickly. Two minutes max if it's very busy. Usually it's not packed. They have 24/7 deals. Just be sure to get a station's player card. Even the non deal dishes are cheaper than most places. Service is excellent and the food is decent."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a midnight meal. Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Dinner and a bowl of Chili Cheese Fries (I'm a gluten for punishment). For was tasty, hot, and plenty of it. The party ordered the Shrimp Cocktail and the Mac & Cheese, and a order of Oriental Chicken Salad. All was good. The only draw back was the service was a little slow, but for 3 am, not to bad. Place was packed."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I have eaten at SEVERAL of the Grand Cafes in the Stations Chains (the worst by far to this point has been the one at Red Rock) over the years. I used to eat in them back when they existed the first time, then when they became Denny's and Coco's, and again when they were brought back again as Grand Cafes. I have to say that with the exception of Kim, Wayne, Charles and Joey on the Graveyard Shift (and they are the reason I raised the overall to 2 stars instead of 1 or 0 stars), I have pretty much had nothing but horrible experiences at the one at the Santa Fe Station.

The most recent issues have occured over the last 2 days (12-29 and 12-30-12). For starters, they have decided that you can only have one slice of toast (cut in half to \"2\" pieces of toast) on your breakfast meals. Then, NONE of their cooks apparently have learned how to cook an egg over-easy. Next, when you ask for a side of toast (again only one slice cut into halves), it is $2.99 for that one slice of bread. Then, on their menu it says you can substitute soup or salad, however when you try to order the soup over night, they tell you that they no longer serve soup at night.

I am sure that Stations people won't see this, but I do have to say that if you go to these cafes, you have a better time than I have the last few times. I hate to say it, but I think I am going to have to start going back to Denny's for my early morning breakfasts."}
{"text":"10 min to be acknowledged by the server, 15 min to get our drinks, 45 without food after ordering...
When we got up to ask the server what was going on, they cleared the table. 
They treated everyone else in the restaurant the same way.
If you don't want to make money why are you open?!"}
{"text":"I got the best service I've received in any casino since I've lived here in Vegas. The waitress was so nice she's been arranged to bring a Hot Toddy to my table when she over heard that I needed one. 

All the things that's great but I have to especially brag on the cheesecake... It was extremely rich with fresh strawberries and three times bigger than anywhere else."}
{"text":"It was not busy at all and it still took forever to get our food.  Our waitress was super unfriendly and service was not great.  Not the worst place I've been to, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Not happy this visit.  Told the lady carving the meat about a problem with undercooked bacon next to her and she gave attitude."}
{"text":"We stayed over in Henderson for one night. As soon as we checked in the Hampton Inn, noticed the Sunset Palace next door (didn't stay there because I know about there \"extra\" fees). We went to the Grand Cafe for dinner and then the next morning had breakfast there before leaving town. We had wonderful service and enjoyed our waitresses. The food was very good. Had to help my husband eat his enormous stack of tasty pancakes.
Will eat here again when in town."}
{"text":"We usually eat here for breakfast when we are in town, unless we decide to try another local spot. I've ordered many things on their menu, like the burgers, fish tacos, hot wings, salads, chicken fried steak, sandwiches, all kinds of breakfast concoctions, steaks, etc. So far, I haven't had any problems with food that I've ordered. We have always have great servers, so no problems there. 

The restaurant is clean. They have booths, tables, and countertop seating. The restaurant is big and there's plenty of seating for large parties. They have a pretty good choice of items on their regular menu and they also have a late night menu that has cheaper items, but it's dine in only and it's super short. They really need to put more items on that menu. There's literally 4 or 5 items on it. They also have a good amount of desserts, but they're a hit or miss. I've had the chocolate blackout cake that was very good, but then I've also had the strawberry cheesecake that was super hard and disgusting once you were lucky enough to get the fork through it."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times after my original review (I try to avoid coming here at All costs nowadays) and I really, honestly Did Not want to leave a bad review but I just have to. When this place re-opened (hence my older 5 star review of this place) it was Really, Really great!! Now, I'll just tell you what happened tonight, I'll cut to the chase, was sat quickly & greeted, which is why I'm giving 2 stars (which doesn't happen too often here), the food came out quick, I ordered a simple dish, chicken quesadilla...comes out quick than I start eating it and it just taste like french toast than I tell myself maybe its just me, after like a third through my plate I smell the quesadilla and it smells like cinnamon. Call server, he confirms, \"I believe they were making French Toast a little while ago (well thank God I didn't order the Salmon I really wanted to originally lol). Manager lady (which was very nice) comes and she does make it mostly right for me and by that I mean, she has my quesadilla re-made after confirming that they indeed Do use the same grill for all the dishes all night (Dugh!!), it's really not a good excuse whatsoever but whatever...(still had a tiny bit of the taste/smell of french toast) but than they both (manager/server) quietly as nicely as possible both kinda give me the cold shoulder obviously for the remainder of my stay. My experience I suppose was better than last time (not by much though) where I had to wait 10 minutes to get sat than another 10 for my drink order (which was just a water cup no ice, no lemon) and another 10 for her to take my order...than the server has the audacity to give me a bad attitude and talks back to me because I was upset for waiting 30 minutes for someone to take my order!! Bad, shame on GV Ranch. Here's a little business lesson especially the restaurant business, Clean Your Grill more often so my quesadilla doesn't taste and smell like French Toast!!!"}
{"text":"It's getting harder to find awesome deals for meals in Vegas.  Gone are the days you can get buffets for $5 or prime rib dinners for $7.99.  Oh Sahara, how I miss you!  

Visiting family in Henderson, we headed over to Sunset Station for some dinner. They had prime rib dinner for $9.99, so I had to get it.  For a Saturday night, it was packed and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  

My prime rib dinner was good, but I should've ordered it medium rare, because medium well wasn't as tasty.  

Service was good and food was decent.  I just wished the prime rib dinner was little bit cheaper and then I would've given them a higher rating.  Their t-bone steak dinner special was $12.99, which I thought was a bit high for Vegas.  

Grand Cafe is way better than Denny's, so for a local 24 hour spot, I'd come back to eat."}
{"text":"We checked in late to the hotel and was soooo excited they were open. Our server Lucky was great! Very attentive and had a great personality. Our food was fresh despite the late hour. My hubs had steak and eggs, boy was he in heaven because the steak was grilled to perfection. 2 thumbs up from 2 fluffy foodies!"}
{"text":"-sat at the bar for brunch and it took over 10 minutes to be a acknowledged at the bar
-food took forever and my poached eggs were hard boiled and my server never came back for me to send them back.
-complained at check out and no effort to make the experience right"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast cafe away from the smokiness of the casino. The specials are an amazing deal. Food is consistently good quality and they have a wide variety of breakfast and lunch items. Service is friendly and casual. Great place to relax and enjoy brunch. They also have a great selection of hot teas!"}
{"text":"The food use to be really good here, we were very happy when they closed Coco's and brought back the Grand Cafe a few years ago.  Unfortunately the quality seems to be have been slowly sliding down.  Afters years of eating here we probably will not not do so much anymore.  On the upside our waiter is usually really good and really attentive.  The manager is occasionally walking around, but it seems like he does what he can to avoid customers.  My skillet plate tonight was only so so at best and they shorted my little brother on his wings."}
{"text":"We are local, and have eaten at most GVR restaurants, and this was by far the worst.  The server was friendly, thus the only reason I went 2 stars instead of 1.

We were there Sunday morning for breakfast, around 8pm, so well before the busy time.  Seated right away but took at least 15 minutes to get coffee.  I had their signture banana fosters french toast - and honestly I never met a french toast I didn't like, until then.  I love bananas foster also, and while some are better than others, this was just terrible.  No flavor, and not sure what they used to do the flame, and while a nice presentation, it tasted like kerosene in the food.

The people dining next to us ending up leaving, as their food was served not to order, and cold.  When nothing got done, they got fed up and left.  

When we finally left, and were waiting for the extremely slow checkout process, we noticed quite a few bugs in the pastry case. 

Do yourself a favor, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow.  Great late night menu! Can't beat 99 cents short stack. The food was great.  Customer service was on point.  Great late night spot to get some quick food ."}
{"text":"Went here on 12/31/11 after an afternoon of shopping. I was looking at their bakery case when suddenly a girl popped up from behind the counter and asked me what I wanted. I opted for the biggest thing in the case - a $5 giant brownie that could easily serve 6 (which it did when I got home.) It was weird because a small cannoli was $5.75 and there was such a huge difference in quantity for the price. 

The brownie was SOLID - you need a metal fork because it was partially frozen. It wasn't the best brownie ever, but it was the largest!"}
{"text":"Dinner was pretty bad. Add slow service and it worsened the experience. Breakfast was much better. Stay away from the day old 1/2 frozen baked goods."}
{"text":"This place serves good diner style food.  Once order is placed, the food is served fast and hot.  I ate here twice.  Once for breakfast at midnight and a 2nd time for dinner at 10pm.  Hostess/cashier service were misses both times, but servers were friendly and helpful.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Service sucks. Food sucks. Got our order wrong. Hamburger bun was stale and hard as a rock to the point of being inedible. Won't be going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"My first time trying the chicken piccata, so flavorful tender juicy white wine lemons caper and baby tomatoes and spinach."}
{"text":"I ordered their Fathers Day special that included half rack ribs, corn on the cob, string beans ( which never came), and Cole slaw.  The corn was outstanding! 
The ribs were the worst I've ever had.  I pulled what looked like the skin of a fish off the first rib and about gave the whole dinner back.  I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving, obviously,  because I still ate the ribs.  BBQ cardboard may have tasted better.  They were over cooked and the meat was tough.
I think I'm going to quit eating here all together."}
{"text":"Prime rib special is now $12.99.  Went there last night because we drove by and saw a huge sign on the outside of the casino that says \"$11.99 Prime Rib Special\" but the menu said $12.99 prime rib special.  After consulting the manager we were given the lower price. Hey, a dollar's a dollar, bro.  The prime rib was pretty darn good.  Came with a huge baked potato and green beans. 

It took about 10 minutes to get seated and about 10 minutes to have someone take our drink orders.  When someone doesn't come by the table for 10 minutes I get a little antsy but the Hungarian waitress we had was very nice. 

Minus one star cuz' my coffee cup had lipstick on it.  (I don't wear lipstick)"}
{"text":"maitré d MAI MAI was warm and very welcoming. Vern the chef came with his version of herb butter sauce for our Orange Roughy (chopped chives mixed in butter)... the reason they ran out is because the night chef was fired.

Perhaps next time will be better again. The apple crumble was good though."}
{"text":"really bad service plus the burguers taste really weird and bad im really mad tbh 30 dollars for only 2 burguers and a really bad service"}
{"text":"Bad service, indifferent staff, dirty, slow - don't waste your time or $$ at this place"}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, nice art nouveau inspired surroundings, the fried chicken platter was tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, the prime rib special was tasty, moist, the french fries fresh and crunchy.  Wonderful selection of herbal teas, and champagne."}
{"text":"What a train wreck! When we walked in we we're told \"One moment please\" while a large group of staff stood in front of TV watching the 8:15pm drawing . Not one of them could seat us?  Our service was good , The waitress did have to ask me what we ordered again because the system didn't take it. Whatever!  The food on the other hand was horrible. My stomach still hurts 14 hours after eating their food. We started with Potato Skins. Cold potatoes , very old bacon, and dried green onions, YUK!. I had the Bacon and Blue Cheese Burger. First thing I did was take off the bacon. Wasn't going to eat more of that. My fries where ice cold and the burger was nasty. It tasted like burnt gristle. I could not taste the blue cheese or anything but burnt gristle. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out a good color but it was dry. My  guest ordered the Prime Rib it was over cooked, dry and tasteless. Had ordered fries for the side and got a baked potato. The vegetables on the plate we're undercooked and cold. Thought we would finish with a piece of Cheesecake. In all my life I have never had such a horrible piece of cheesecake. It tasted like sour cream and sugar with an undercooked pie crust . No graham cracker crust. I will never ever eat at this place again, even if it is free."}
{"text":"This place has a bad impression. We were gonna try them then the extremely rude hostess was sarcastic and rude when they had plenty of tables and when we asked she said hey didn't have anything open. I was like I see six tables open. Then in her rude voice was like oh your leaving. I was like yes you don't want to sit anyone down. We will NEVER come back here again! Very rude and ignorant. They need to replace her I think her name was Jennifer. She needs to work on her customer service and politeness needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"My son and I wanted a quick cafe meal and stoped by this restaurant.  I ordered the prime rib my son ordered a sandwich.  I ordered my prime rib rare and told the waitress that if the did not have rare to let me know and I would order something else.  The sandwich came out fine the prime rib was well done.  I asked to speak to the manager who came out and was completely rude to me.  I then ordered the chicken parmigian and waited 20 minutes for that to come out.  When it came out the chicken was burnt, which I felt was done on purpose.  By this point I just wanted to leave, since nothing was comped I went to pay for the dinner and the cook was standing at the counter he asked me how was dinner and I told him it was horrible.  He then began to insult me.  This restaurant clealy does care about it's customers and the food is horrible.  Will never return."}
{"text":"I've been to the Grand Cafe a thousand times and every time I thought it was great except for the last time. The only reason I'm writing a bad review is I want them to correct it. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs as I frequently do. When the order came it was a food runner that brought it. The steak was cold and greasy. I ordered the eggs over medium but they came barely cooked and cold. I will go back again because I hope this was a one time thing. Green Valley Ranch please never let this happen again."}
{"text":"Anytime we have been to Boulder Station we usually end up staying long enough to eat here since they are open 24 hours a day. Especially when you get carried away on the machines.

The food is pretty good at this cafe. Not bad at all.

I really like the boneless chicken strips with the buffalo sauce. They are so good. My husband always get breakfast here as well as different dinners, And everything is usually really good when it comes out. Cooked just right and always good flavor 

It is very rare there is a wait especially later hours but if a concert they had gets out then it does get busy. They are always friendly from the time being seated till you pay.  Service at times has been slow depending on business of course. A lot of locals come in since it is so far from the strip.

We have found this location to always be consistent with the food and service. Never had any problems and would recommend if your near boulder looking for some inexpensive food check this Cafe out!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the prices and you can't beat the friendly staff. I love coming here, mostly for the nostalgia. I've been coming to Boulder Station since childhood and its nice to see them keep up with the place."}
{"text":"Let me tell you grand cafe exceeds my expectation and beyond. Their service and food is way better than Dennys also if you have a players club membership you can get a decent & very cheap meal late at night or anytime during the day. Their ice tea was excellent and I got my meal under 5 mins when it was kinda busy around 12 midnight. My server did a great job refilling my drink every time when it was empty."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to the Grand Café for our Thursday night date night. We had a $10 off coupon which helped make our decision as to where to go. I must say, I was happy with the place. We had an adorable waitress named Donna, who couldn't do enough for us. She works on Thursday nights, so if you go then, ask for her. We ordered nachos as an appetizer and they were HUGE! But we were so hungry, we finished them, no problem!  I had the bacon blue cheese burger which I absolutely loved. I asked for blue cheese dressing on the side and slathered it on the bun.  SO GOOD!!! And, I dipped my French fries in it!!!  My hubby wasn't so lucky - ordered the corned beef hash which comes with poached eggs.  Donna was very specific when she wrote down our order, POACHED SOFT!!!  I mean, come on, would you eat corned beef hash with hard cooked eggs??? Well, apparently the cook though my hubby would...he sent it back because of the eggs.  They came back only slightly better.  I think one of the big problems is the waitress/waiter takes the correct order and then someone else serves it, so they have no idea how it was ordered.  But, overall, we would go back because the food was good and Donna was a real sweetheart!!!"}
{"text":"One night we stopped in for a late meal.. I had 15 breaded shrimp with fries for only $5! The next day we stopped by for a quick bite and I realized that yelp had a \"buy one entree get one free\" offer. We had a waitress who was friendly, funny, and fast. So the service is good. Considering how inexpensive this place is (buy one dessert get one free from 6-9pm) I was surprised at how good the food tasted :) Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Eggs  were cold, just  plain  awful service  was slow . I would  strongly  advise  everyone to stay  away  unless  you  like  over priced food  that  comes  cold and  drinks  that  are watered down."}
{"text":"Breakfast....don't do it!
Bland, bland, bland. Ugh. Awful. Even the eggs sucked. The hash browns...worst ever...and they had a gray color to it!
Service, took the waitress forever to take just our drink orders! And it was dead.
The lady going around for keno, rude.
I would save your money and go somewhere not in this casino...or hit the buffet for breakfast. 
So not worth anything here."}
{"text":"On my one recent foray here everything was okay but the food and service were largely unremarkable.  An appetizer of Deviled Eggs had a little zip and was very tasty.  Pan-fried Pork Pot Stickers were good, although the Ginger Soy Dipping Sauce accompanying this app was very salty.  Salisbury Steak was prepared more medium than medium rare as ordered but was tasty mixed with a generous amount of Mushroom Gravy.  Mashed Potatoes were fine but cooked fresh vegetables were rather bland. 

Our server did not show up very often to refill water glasses or check on my party of four.  But, worst of all, my entree portion proved to not be adequate in size.  I was still hungry after I walked out of a live Tribute to Michael Jackson show on the Texas Station premises 1-1/2 hours later.  So much so that, while all others in my group moseyed over to play slots for awhile, I made a quick beeline to the Texas Star Oyster Bar to quell the hunger pangs before heading home!"}
{"text":"STEAK & EGGS PEOPLE! Every time I come here for breakfast I get the steak and eggs with a mimosa or bloody mary. I like my steak medium rare and eggs over easy, they nail it and the seasoning is great too. Ask for Camylle if she is working, BEST SERVER EVER! If I don't get her I will take anyone, every one is very nice and provide top notch service."}
{"text":"Usually stop in here late nights for breakfast. Get a players card and they will give you the specials menu which is very reasonably priced. Can get a good breakfast for about 4 bucks (excluding soft drink/tip). Service has always been quick and friendly."}
{"text":"PROS:
- The servers and hostesses were helpful and friendly.
- Place settings were nice and traditionally decorated.

CONS:
- Food was poor quality. Big portions, but no substance. 
- I got the county fried chicken steak and it was tough. The gravy was not very flavorful.
- The french toast was not crispy. 
- The bacon was overcooked and dry.
- The restaurant is freezing cold. Bring a jacket!
- Food is overpriced. Be prepared to spend about $10 a person."}
{"text":"To my surprise we had a really nice dining experience that I was not expecting. 

Our server Chris was Awesome, he was sweet and friendly as well as attentive.

I had the fish, shrimp and chips (fries) platter. It was delicious, cod with a really good batter and tarter sauce.

My husband had a breakfast combo and those two big fluffy pancakes served with it were delicious!

The food is really tasty, hot, fresh and generous!

My side salad with ranch dressing was even extra good.

We will be back if ever visiting the east side of las vegas again. We live on the west side so it won't be often however we can always try the closer Grand Cafe's located in the other related properties."}
{"text":"This is a gem hidden in a very old Texas Station Casino. Maybe it's not any fancy Vegas Strip Cafe....but the service staff is professional and attentive....they offer an egg dish called Loco Moco and they do it right....not greasy and beautifully presented. My wife ordered the Weekday Special for Monday---Chicken Cordon Bleu that was napped with the delicious cream sauce...all this plus a fresh garden salad  $22.00 plus tip!"}
{"text":"I mean I have been going here for years and it truly is A-OK. It's nothing amazing but after a long night out or if you happen to find yourself there the next morning, it's a solid place to grab something to eat. The food is solid but not mind blowing and the service is just right. Granted one of the biggest benefits to this cafe vs. other casino cafe's is they still offer Keno service to your table."}
{"text":"We were hungry for corned beef and cabbage on this holiday to celebrate drinking, oops, I mean St. Patrick! 
The cafe had a $9.99 corned beef meal, which everyone in our group ordered. Out of the 3 plates, the meat on just one looked pretty good and the rest not so much. Mine had a lot of fat, and no seasoning on the beef. 
The cabbage was fine, and the potatoes were good. After asking our server for butter and not getting it, we asked a busser and then finally got it. One plate was sent back for a reuben, which was a good choice. We should have sent them all back. It was an attempt at cooking a traditional meal, which didn't work out for our table! 
We were disappointed that no one addressed our complaint after we expressed our dissatisfaction to our server. 
I guess the Luck 'O the Irish wasn't with us this time!"}
{"text":"Oh what has happened to the Grand Cafe?? Always one of my favorite spots for breakfast and every so often for dinner. Went last night and was hugely disappointed. It was very busy with few empty tables, but they are obviously way understaffed. We waited quite a while before someone finally came to seat us. We were seated at a back booth near the bar. We found out our server was actually the bartender who had to serve a busy bar as well as three booths near the bar. 

We ordered the $9.99 T-bone special and the prime rib. They both came with baked potatoes which he asked if we wanted loaded. Yes, of course :)  After waiting a really long time the dinners finally arrived. The prime rib was cold, the potatoes were hard as rocks and the T-bone was really gristly and chewy.  When we got the bill, we were charged $1.99 for \"loaded baked potatoes\". It was basically a little cheese and bacon. Was not told of the charge and don't remember seeing it on the menu. 

With this poor of food and service (worst service I have had there) they need to make some serious improvements. With Terra Verde. China Spice and Sushi & Sake all closed I don't know how they can be so understaffed. I will return soon for breakfast and hope that is a totally different experience."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised to find some bad reviews of the Grand Cafe at GVR. I think it is one the best breakfasts around, is open 24 hours, and has a wide variety of items to chose from. I have never had a bad meal here. 

Went for breakfast this morning and got the bananas foster french toast. It was very good, they even lit it on fire when they brought it to the table! It is pretty sweet so beware but it was really good. They also serve some of the best pancakes, cooked perfectly. Another one of my favorites is the breakfast sliders. It's sausage, egg and cheese on a fresh baked biscuit (you get 2) with hash browns and gravy...Mmmmm. 

The coffee is Kona coffee which I always enjoy. You get a large pot for only $2.79. Service was great as always. Will always be one of my top picks for breakfast. If you go for lunch or dinner the burgers are very good."}
{"text":"I just wasn't a fan.

$30 for breakfast for two adults and one toddler is a little crazy to me.

I asked for a kids menu and the waitress told me they didn't have one for the kiddos to draw on but that they did have kid items. She then recited to me what they had available. However, I am a consumer that likes to make wise choices. I like to see what I am ordering, how much it is going to cost me, how many of what I am getting, etc. I think you get the point. Needless to say, I made a blind purchase so when the bill came and my son's pancakes cost more than the breakfast I purchased for myself, I was a little dumbfounded.

I ordered the breakfast off of the light fare and it only cost me $3.99. This alone was a steal for toast, eggs, bacon and hash browns. 

But my one cup of coffee cost me almost $3.00, go figure.

So wherever I got a deal at, I got robbed on something else. 

My son's pancakes were $6.00 for 3 pancakes. I just don't get it. 

The food was decent I should say. I don't know I expected better prices, I guess.
And I didn't like the booster chairs in the booth. When I asked for a high chair they told me they couldn't put a highchair at the booths. 

Yes, the food was decent. But it wasn't a family friendly place and to me that is very important. And really, $6.00 for 3 kid pancakes just rubs me the wrong way."}
{"text":"Their menu selection is huge, offering selections to any palette! I've had everything from their chicken Caesar to apple pie ala mode and I've enjoyed all of it! They make delicious breakfast, all their portions are generous, and the restaurant recently went under renovations so it's new and updated. 
Pretty consistent service on every visit, a little slower later into the evening, which is understandable because of the hour.
When you walk in to the restaurant, there's a beautiful glass case showcasing delicious cakes and pastries! I love to examine them as I wait to be seated. They change their bakery selections daily, so it's always a sight to see! I love pretty cakes and cupcakes!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for lunch since it's close to home. It's hit or miss if it's going to be busy! The service is pretty good and the food is decent and serving size is also a pretty good value."}
{"text":"Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. 

Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. 

Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. 

I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: \"The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant\". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the \"FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT\"

If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead."}
{"text":"There is a Grand Cafe at every single Station Casino property besides for Aliante. Personally, I only come to Grand Cafes after midnight for the Graveyard special. But, unfortunately not all Grand Cafe's are born equally.  

This location at Texas Station is light years ahead of the Santa Fe and the Red Rock location. 

The service is extremely quick. Unlike the Red Rock, this place will actually tell you \"I'll be right with you\" instead of just pretending to ignore you. 

The server comes within 2-3 minutes after the host seats you. At Red Rock and Santa Fe, the server may take up to 30 minutes.
 
The servers here at Texas Station won't make excuses. At Red Rock and Santa Fe, the servers absolutely can't stop making excuses. It's always \"I'm just so busy!\" or \"No one told me that I was supposed to be your server!\". 

Unlike at Red Rock, you won't get seated near  drunk douchebags in club clothing, who are screaming profanity and racist remarks. You don't get that annoying bitter Summerlin/North West crowd that complains and fights over every little thing. The customers here at Texas are more of a blue collared working class type, who enjoy a quiet environment when they eat.

The food here is much better. At Red Rock, a huge part of the steak is that rubbery fatty substance that is inedible. The steak here at Texas is all meat and much more tender. You don't have to work your ass off to eat it!

I find it odd how Summerlin and NW people always talk sh!t on North Las Vegas residents. They always say that NLV people are: \"poor\", \"criminals\", \"low lives\". But, when you actually come to a NLV casino, the service and quality is far superior to a Summerlin casino. I hate how at Summerlin casinos, the workers always b!tch about how they hate their jobs and how: \"he only tipped me 2 dollars\". Gimme a break,  if my Graveyard special meal only cost $4.99, I ain't gonna f*cking leave a tip that is more than the price of the f*cking meal. Be happy I even leave 50 cents.    

I would rather drive the extra distance to come here. The service is very friendly, and the food tastes way better."}
{"text":"If you're staying or playing at Sunset Station and plan on eating here, be sure to have a player's card, as they sure have some great deals!  (at least they did in October when we were there).

I ate here four times during our four night stay.  Husband joined me for three of them.  They were featuring some $3.99 specials for player's card folks, including breakfast and a burger.  I had the breakfast one a couple times.  The first time, it was sheer perfection!  Eggs over-easy, crispy bacon, nicely browned hashbrowns with terrific rye toast. Had the exact same thing later in the trip and it was good but the hashbrowns were not as perfectly executed (less brown), and Husband experienced the lesser browned version as well.

I also tried the BLT which was very good (lots of B), and another time tried the $3.99 burger special which was quite decent as well.

Servers work really hard here, especially as it got closer to the weekend and it got a lot busier.  Which also meant longer waits to get a table and even longer to pay on the way out."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night , not my first choice. I got the steak with potatoes and shrimp, it was good but nothing I haven't tried before. Maybe if they made there own sauce or something but the steak was good. It was just hard to cut , wish my steak would cut itself. Overall customer service was great, food was good not great but not sure if I would come back here."}
{"text":"The day that we visited the restaurant we were greeted by a friendly hostess and she explained that the restaurant had a limited menu and if we were to order in hot foods that it would take a bit longer because it was being prepared in different restaurants kitchen. That was fine. I appreciated the honesty and heads up. She sat us and we waited...and waited....and waited...decided what we wanted....and waited again. No server came to greet us, no one to take our drink orders and mind you the restaurant was not very busy and there was about 4 servers on the floor along with a couple of server assistants. So while we sat for awhile and waited with our menus closed, FINALLY a lady wearing a nametag \"Asalia\" approaches our table and says \" what can I get for you\". No formal greeting, no mention of her name, she didn't even apologize for the wait. She took our drink and food order and walked away. She came back with our drinks. I had a soda and the third person in our party had an iced tea. She dropped the iced tea in front of me and the two of us both point out i didn't have the iced tea but she still plops down the soda in front of the wrong person and doesn't switch the drinks. Our food comes and she again puts the wrong plate in front the wrong person so we have to correct her, this time she changed it. Not even half way into our meal but when we are almost done, does she come to check on us. I needed more ketchup and soda. She asked the gentleman if he wanted more iced tea and our glasses were filled at the same height but failed to ask if I would like more soda. She was quick to clear our plates and drop the check. 

I ordered the Philly cheese steak and surprisingly it was very good. The meat was kind of interesting though, because it looked like big chucks of hamburger but again it was good. The french fries had an extra crispy texture which i enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I had the eggs Benedict, truthfully it tasted bland. My English muffin was soggy as soon as it hit the table which means it probably sat in the window for a while. The hollandaise was more eggy than I'd like. It just wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"This is where I went when I was in the mood for some wonderful meatload and mached potatoes with firm string beans.  Super club sandwiches and great breakfasts.  Heck, everything was very good!  Close walk from Whitney Ranch too."}
