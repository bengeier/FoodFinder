{"text":"This and the Edo in Southland Crossing are my go-to fast food places.  The teppanyaki is great, the sushi is on par with Kinjo's (at least the simple salmon and tuna rolls which I order every time), and the staff are friendly.  They've never given me a reason to not like them in the two years I've gone to this location."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Edo for multiple reasons. One, as I have a gluten allergy, there's a menu where I can eat more than one thing. 
Two, the food is always fresh. It's hard to get a bad plate of food from Edo, as the meat is thinly sliced and cooked great so it never tastes shitty. 
Three, it's good fast food that's not going to give you that terrible feeling 3 hours after you've eaten. The food is pretty healthy and on the favorable side of quick food as it's good for you. 
Four, it's fresh and cooked right infront of you. 

Although, I'm a huge fan of sushi and the sushi here is below par. Not that great, but not terrible. Definetly will not please the palate of a serious sushi lover. 

Sometimes during lunch/dinner hour, the line up goes out the door. The whole process of waiting in line to order, to waiting in line for your food to be prepared can take a while. But overall, good place to eat."}
{"text":"Basically the same food as you get in the malls. Their is a few subtle differences in the menu, plus they charge more. If you like this type of food then you know what your in for. No authentic flavors. The teriyaki sauce, doesn't even taste like teriyaki."}
{"text":"I love Edo and I love Japanese food... So one evening after work I felt like some gyoza to go with some left over sushi I had from Co-op the day before (by the way, the sushi there is good)

So I stroll in order and wait.. I have had gyoza from different locations before so I know it's delicious.....

Well.... I ordered 3 gyoza and after waiting 10 minutes (yes I understand it was busy) I bring the little side dish home and open it up to realize all my gyoza were SEVERELY burnt and not just \"oh it just had some colour\"  they were black on the bottoms and even tasted burnt through-out. They also didn't give me any gyoza sauce *sad face*

I was very disappointed. I haven't gone back yet to try the other items I normally love to eat at Edo, because I'm afraid they might turn out less then delicious as well...

Maybe one day....."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering their new sushi and udon. Both were terrible. Sushi was dry, fish was stale. Udon noodles tasted overcooked and soup was msg. I usually order their hot plates which are great and what they're known for."}
{"text":"So I wanted fast but not fast food. I had forgotten that Edo had sushi so that was a pleasant surprise when I walked in. 
I can't say that the table was really clean but I knocked off the pieces of vegetable that obviously fell off someones plate and all was good. That bathroom was a little dirty but I guess they have take out so who cares, right??? 
I ordered the teriyaki chicken and beef dish, same as always. It was good, at least the vegetables are real and mostly fresh. Pretty good lunch for fast food. It was fast too, they make it there in front of you and you are eating before you know it. 

This review is more about the fast food sushi. 

I have had the sushi at a different Edo and I was quite happy. So I ordered a Dynamite roll which is a tempura shrimp, WAY WAY too much lettuce, and I'm not sure what else. It did have roe on the top which I enjoy but who would have thought lettuce could be over bearing. It tasted like a lettuce role, not sushi. 
I also had the spicy salmon roll which has salmon, cucumber and spicy mayo on top. I have had different variations of this at many places but this one was plain and not fresh. I could only muster up the strength to eat two pieces.

This place was a disappointment but I will try one again. Just not right away..."}
{"text":"This Edo just recently reopened after going through an extensive renovation and I gotta say, it's pretty nice. Food is typically Edo. Cooked fresh and tastes great. Coke machine is self serve, off to the side, with cutlery, straws and napkins available. They are also now selling an assortment of Japanese snacks and items. Like a small grocery section. Seating is a variety. There are some tables and chairs and some long tables with barstool type chairs. The staff are really nice. They all say hello when you walk in and all say good bye or thank you when you leave."}
{"text":"This Edo is surprisingly clean for a fast food place. Also, their sushi has improved for fast food as well!"}
{"text":"The staff is simply amazing, very eager to please and super fast. Best Edo in Calgary"}
