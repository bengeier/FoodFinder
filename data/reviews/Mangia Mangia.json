{"text":"I was out looking for a place for a late lunch in rural Geauga County, and found that the pickins are slim.  Mangia's entry on here was pretty good, so we decided to check it out.  I have no complaints with the service, but the food is mediocre at best.    I had the eggplant parmagiana and my partner had the chicken parm.  Both dishes were essentially pre-formed, pre-breaded patties covered by a thin layer of marinara sauce and a slice of provalone that was placed under a heating element.  Both meals came with a side of pasta, which, had it been a steak, would have been great because it was tender and you could cut it with a fork.   But it wasn't a steak ... it was pasta. And pasta shouldn't be \"fork tender.\"  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad ... it was perfectly edible, but it's not anything an Italian might recognize as food of the motherland."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this resturant. The Italian is perfect . Raised in a Italian neighborhood  you know what is real Italian. This restruant unlocked those memories. If you are looking for the old Italian  taste and can't make little Italy  this is for you. Ourstanding"}
{"text":"My parents and I dined there on Saturday afternoon.  They came across it accidentally while taking a drive the previous weekend and said they loved it.  It wasn't very busy when we were there Saturday.  But after sitting there a while it started to fill up.  I ordered the pasta Neapolitan.  I assume it is a classic Italian dish but I'd never tried it anywhere else.  I enjoyed it.  I don't know if it would compare with the Italian ideal of it though.  It tasted like macaroni cheese with tomatoes added.  As I said I enjoyed it, but would've like more tomatoes.  The best part of the meal was the bread. It was delicious and they weren't stingy with it at all.  We asked for a second serving and were given more than we could eat, so we got to take some home for later. Delicious!  The decor is not fancy but the food is good and that is all that matters when it comes down to it.   I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"What a treat. In the country, laid back, but great food and great service.  A Must if you like Italian Food!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from family. The bread was good, but things only seemed to go south from there. Salad was OK, covered in the cheese($0.90 up charge for cheese and dressing) The meals really where everything went sideways. I got the Italian Sausage with ziti pasta, noodle were al dente, sausage was tough, and the sauce was horrible. Honestly the sauce tasted canned, and not even a good canned sauce.  The sign up front says a really good Italian restaurant, but while I was eating I couldn't  help looking at the Zeppe's across the road and wishing I was there instead. 1 star for the bread, really their only redeeming quality."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and great service make this a favorite, worth the 40-minute drive for us. Try the tender Chicken Formaggio, made in a sauce of Swiss cheese and white wine with artichokes and mushrooms. Good to the last drop. Save some bread to mop up the sauce. No one will fault you! Nice, casual and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at Mangia Mangia.  This place looks like it's been around forever.  We had the Antipasto Salad and a small pizza.  The salad was fresh and chilled.  The Italian salad dressing was a red wine vinaigrette with Italian herbs.  Perfecto!  The pizza had a medium crust.  The red sauce was flavorful.  All in all a great pizza dinner."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant experience here. Came in with nine people (one was very rowdy) on short notice and were in a hurry as we were attending a wedding later that day. Connie worked very quickly and we were NOT easy to deal with (a lot of dietary restrictions and in a rush). Aside from a vegetarian getting pepperoni instead of peppers (the rowdy one was talking loudly while she was ordering) everything came out very quickly and was very tasty. Great food. Better service. Small town charm. What more could you ask for? 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered a salad for a busy day staying in the office for lunch. Smelled like a dirty dishrag and was limp. Will not ever order from here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and reasonable prices. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken an blt pizzas! Definitely seems like a local favorite"}
{"text":"Food was good but service very slow. Extremely loud in restaurant, it was hard to talk in a normal conversational voice at times. This was a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Great place to eat & one of my favorites. Good prices & good portions. Seafood Alfredo A+  Pizza A+"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in Geauga County.  Warm, cozy atmosphere, amazing food, and great prices.  Couldn't ask for friendlier staff or a more generous owner, who constantly helps and gives to Newbury Schools.  A must visit when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love the people here.  Great service and outstanding food.  Never been disappointed with the food and the family loves it too."}
{"text":"Our second visit.  So so first time.  This time, really how can you serve potato skins hard!  Cook them.  Thanks for redoing them and burning the crust on the skins,  Guess what burnt skin, still too hard!  Who needs help knowing how to cook a baked potato, really??  Pizza was so so..."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of our favorite places to eat. Simple good Italian food. Friendly staff and nice family atmosphere. The ravioli is great. And they have a large selection on the menu so your sure to find something for everyone. Definitely try out Mangia Mangia if your in the area and want good Italian faire."}
{"text":"Our last experience was dreadful, Waitress, was more interested in talking to her friends than taking care of customers. My wife asked for some butter when she brought the bread and she never did bring it, seemed like forever to get our order and when we did my chicken parmesan was warm but the rigatoni and meatballs were actually cold, as was my wifes. She never did come to our table to refill our drinks but found time to mingle with other waitress's. We've been here before and have had good waitress's but this last time was horrific. Even the food wasn't as it's been in the past. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Classic, cheap, and easy pizza place that tends to be a family favorite. They have a HUGE menu, so pretty much anyone will be able to find something they have a taste for. The food is consistently good but not great, so don't expect anything AMAZING and you'll likely be satisfied. Some personal favorites are pizza (of course), chicken Marsala, and the calamari. Wait time is usually not too long, so take out is super convenient. Atmosphere inside can be a bit overwhelming, as the interior is surprisingly large, but the plus is there's usually lots of seating if you're trying to dine in."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious, and the portions were big! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We go here a couple times a month, so here are my thoughts over my 12+ years of going.   My personal favorites are the rigatoni and meatballs, meat ravioli, chicken parmigiana. Salad is good, but a little small and we're not fans of their bread. Service has usually been good, but remember, their is a high school close by, so getting a seat after a football or basketball game can be tough.   They do serve wine and beer, but for some strange reason they don't have a bar. They have a tiny game room for kids, but no bar? Seems strange, since Zeppes across the street packs them in at their bar."}
{"text":"Natalie is by far the absolute worst manager of a restaurant I have ever dealt with, we are in mangia mangia on a weekly basis almost and never once have complained. We had one issue and she downright accused us of lying. Never again will this business get a dollar of our money! Disgusting, she should be managing a fast food restaurant, not a quality family restaurant. It's a shame her family owns this business and will probably do nothing about it!"}
{"text":"This place is good we been here before.   However this time waitress was not attentive, in addition chicken Madison had no sauce nor crisp to it as it usually does. We asked for bread twice never got it until we asked a third time, but by then our food had sat and got cold. Waitress clearly hates her job. We won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"We went tonight and was pleasantly surprised.all four meals were very tasty hot and plentiful.server was excellent. I had shrimp in musroom sause. Brocoli carrots cauliflower wide noodles. Icould just eat about half.wife had chicken marsala and she was content on all areas."}
{"text":"Food and service are always excellent, and you can't beat the price. That said, the place looks old, tired, and worn out. They really need to make a capital investment and spruce up the interior of the restaurant. And, make sure you go to the bathroom before you eat there. If you have to use the restroom in the restaurant, you will lose your appetite. To say the restrooms are gross and disgusting would be an understatement."}
{"text":"If you want to relax, be treated well, eat amazing food, and not spend a mint this is your place. Truly enjoy this place as it has a nice feel and every meal I've had was absolutely top notch. Staff works their butts off to ensure you enjoy and it's very appreciated. I give Manjia Manjia my highest recommendation if you're looking for great, authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"The last time I took my family to this so called Italian restaurant I had the chicken parm , which to my surprise when I cut into my chicken it was chicken fingers with cheese melted on top ...... Sad"}
{"text":"Best Italian Restaurt around! The house salad is amazing, and the rigatoni with meat sauce is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"The clam chowder is exceptional.  We were disappointed that the pasta says homemade on the menu , but is not :(  this was confirmed by our waitress. Would have ordered something else."}
{"text":"First of all I have been living around this area for almost four years and I have never hear of this place I was there last friday and the place was packed which sometimes is a good sign. The place was not what I thought is not fancy at all I mean it's  not a dump but not what I thought  it would be, the service was fast and very good, they sell wine and beer but since I was driving I settle for a soda instead, there is a big choice of dishes from pasta to veal to steak only one choice of this tough which was what I ordered and honestly it was much better than most places around this area the pasta and shrimp that came with it as a side was absolutely amazing and a welcome departure from the choice of sides available elsewhere everything else my party ordered look terrific and the sizes were huge I would recomend this over Applebees or Chilis any day of the week if you are into some tasty Italian food."}
{"text":"You have to know what to order at Mangia.  If you do it is an amazing meal.  I spent 10 years not liking Mangia because I was ordering the wrong things.  I am not a fan of their pasta sauce. It is sweet.  Other than that everything at Mangia is delicious!  I love their veggie pizza.  It is so good! It has a light olive oil sauce base and the veggies are cooked perfectly on it.  They have great calzones- they are huge and a great deal. But the best thing at Mangia Mangia is their Chicken Madison....it is like last meal good.  It is lightly fried and comes with a butter, wine, mushroom sauce with a little bit of scallions.  It is sinfully good.  The flavor combination explodes in your mouth and you cannot get enough of it.  The owner is a great guy and does a lot for the community which makes it even more of a pleasure to eat the Chicken Madison :)  Their Mangia bread is also out of this world.  They also offer whole wheat pasta!  Mangia Mangia is YUM YUM!"}
{"text":"Not so great, for the money charged and the Italian hype.  Don't get me wrong, it's an OK restaurant if you're hungry and just looking for a basic Italian slant.  There's plenty \"Italian\" on the menu (noodles, seafood, parmagiana, etc.) - not just pizza, as the place is catagorized.  Unfortunately for quality and flavor this place definitely does NOT qualify for authentic, heart-warming Italian fare.    Might go again for a bite to eat or just to put something in our stomachs, but not when we have a craving for \"Italian food\" per se."}
{"text":"Despite having driven past Mangia Mangia for years, I only went there for the first time this past December. Without advance reservations, we arrived with a party of 6 on a Sunday evening and were seated right away. Service was quick, all of us had soup/salad, an entree, and were served the courses at the same time. By quick I mean we were in and out in under an hour. I ordered the ravioli soup and loved it. Normally I don't like soup, but this was very tasty and definitely warmed me up on a cold winter day. My main dish was the tortellini with marinara sauce, which wasn't anything spectacular. It was good enough, but it was basically drowned in sauce. Others who ordered dishes that came with sauce (the lasagna and the manicotti, for example) also got a ton of sauce. The bread basket was warm-ish and had  plenty of butter, but could definitely use some garlic salt. Most dishes on the menu seemed to be $10-15.   A party of 14 people came in while we were there and were also seated quickly and at one table. Mangia Mangia is definitely good for large groups, and it has seating areas for smaller parties too."}
{"text":"Long time customer of Mangia Mangia.  The food is consistency good, the prices reasonable, and the service friendly and efficient.  However on our last visit, we started to look around and it gave us pause for thought.   The restaurant is in serious need of a face lift! It is looking very run down and shabby. The carpet is worn out, the vinyl in the booths is splitting and sticky, the plastic water glasses have seen better days, and the stall in the women's rest room is so rusted it looked like it could crumble down around you. It makes you question the condition of the kitchen.... which you don't see. I think the management needs to start investing some money in a refresh ... and quickly!  Long overdue."}
{"text":"We like to come out to Mangia Mangia about once a year, despite the fact we live well over 30 minutes away.  That should tell you something right there.  As others have noted, the place has a dive-y feel to it.  Considering you're in the middle of Geauga county, I wouldn't expect to feel like I'm in an Italian trattoria, much less Little Italy.  The service is friendly, although I will echo the other Yelper who mentioned hidden costs.  We were charged $2 for having anchovies on the side for the deluxe pizza, despite the fact that it comes on the pizza.  I simply took the $2 off of the tip.  Otherwise, the menu is typical Americanized Italian fare, and the food is very good.  I have ordered the Mangia trio a few times (lasagna, chicken parm, fettucine alfredo).  The one complaint about this dish is that the chicken parm does not come with a side of pasta (as it normally does), but that is a minor complaint.  The pizzas are excellent, as are the salads...which are advertised as being \"bottomless\", but our waitress did not ask if I wanted another salad.  Not a biggie, though.  If you live in Geauga County, or near the Cuyahoga/Geauga border, it is worth the drive to check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mangia Mangia for years....family favorites are: lasagna, chicken marsala, ravioli, pizza.   Friendly-polite-clean...and PACKED Friday and Saturday evenings"}
{"text":"We stop here almost every Sunday after church. Love their soups, salads and sandwiches. Staff is attentive. Food never disappoints."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for many years.  Yes we live much closer to Little Italy, but we love this place.  it has a reputation for great pizza, but we have not ordered it too often.  We love to sit down and eat meals here.  Yes it has the decor of a neighborhood dive, but to me that is part of the allure.  It has a nice menu of pizza, subs, sandwiches and pasta dishes.  No, there is no special gourmet food here.  Their complementary garlic bread loaves are great.  Salads and soups are good.  You must try the mussels.  We try them every time.  They are large by NE Ohio standards and well prepared, You must save some bread to soak up the broth.  They are the best we have had in NE Ohio.  Other appetizers are pretty basic.  Entrees are your basic pasta combinations, as well as veal and chicken parmiagiana.  My personal favorite is the penne provencale.  I have never finished it at one sitting.  They have a limited beer and wine list.  Desserts are OK, but I admit I never have much room for dessert after eating here.  The service is very friendly, attentive, and you get a sense you are being served by family.  This is a great place to go, and we make special trips to go here on special occasions."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Monday. Great place. Best veal I ever had. Great service friendly staff."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Their canolis are amazing! Their shrimp capellini is great. Also like their manicotti"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little Italian restaurant!  Their chicken parm with angel hair is fantastic!  We go a couple times a month for lunch and I think I could even eat there more.  We have never had bad food in the entire 6 years I have been coming here.  The service at lunch is always top notch!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, so this might be off a bit...but my girlfriend likes the place. I had a beer and the BLT pizza. Beer cold, pizza good. The portion size and toppings were adequate. I won't put the place on the board for best Italian eatery or pizzeria. But for a local place off the beaten path, it's a go."}
{"text":"Keep in mind the restaurant is located in Geauga County and you'll likely be pleased with your meal.  No, it isn't high end our authentic Italian but it it's good and reasonably priced.  The service is usually fast and friendly.  I have ordered for large groups as well and received a lot of food for the money spent."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Madison and it was awesome. Just a couple of things I would like to see addressed.  This place is in a serious need of some new paint and new carpet.  It is very dated and seems dirty.  I also ordered a pitcher of beer.  When it came to the table I first thought that they had froze the pitchers.  When I touched it I realized it was just a very old plastic pitcher that was what appeared to have survived a sand storm for 5 years.  The beer tasted horrible, like the taps never get cleaned.  Honestly made me curious to think what the kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"Went for my first time last night (5/20/2013) for dinner. Being from the area, I always had low expectations for this Italian place in the middle of no where. I was pleasantly surprised!  Meal:  Everything comes with bread. Also, we had the zucchini sticks for an appetizer. I ordered the mussel pasta and my friend ordered pasta marinara with meatballs. Both came with a salad. We both avoided the pizza because locals had mentioned it being super greasy.   Taste Experience:  Bread = good. Zucchini sticks = good. Mussel pasta = not bad, but the mussels didn't taste fresh. Pasta marinara with meatballs = not bad.   When I got the bill, I noticed they charged me 50 cents for my dressing, though my server didn't mention this when she gave dressing options (minus one star). I hate when restaurants tack on secret additional costs.   I had leftovers, which I am eating right now. I just pulled a hair from it. It looks like a cat/dog hair. I don't have pets, so....... Minus another star. If I had found it while still there, I would have complained."}
{"text":"I love this little place! The menu has a variety of Italian dishes that all come with salads. The service is good and the staff is really friendly. It's a nice alternative to corporate Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I planned a SURPRISE Birthday party  for my wife on June 2nd in the Party Room..Let me first tell you that Jeff and Natalie the owners were VERY  accomodating. Natalie even printed a special birthday menu for my wife. My wife LOVES their EGGPLANT. Natalie was so helpful in planning  the meal & making the party a succss. The salads and food was exquisite. Coleen, our server was exceptional. All of my guests - even some west siders said it was the BEST Italian restaurant that they been to in Cleveland. The food and service was out of this world. Their recommendation of the Cassada cake from DS cakes was superb. If you want to host a party, Mangia and their Party Room is the GREATEST. I highly recommend it.   A++++++  to Jeff, Natalie, Coleen and the Mangia Staff"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian. Friday fish fry is excellent. Great clam chowder. good service. Mangia Mangia is always very good and very consistent. I have never gotten a bad meal here, since they opened. The line can get awfully long and it will get really loud inside on Friday night."}
{"text":"Well, I will admit that being born in Brooklyn and having lived in the NYC metro area, I am a bit of a pizza snob. Was told this was the best pizza around. Although the sauce wasn't bad, the crust is just not what I am used to. That is why I typically avoid pizza outside of NYC and Long Island. The crust is somewhere between Neopolitan and Sicilian style and ones in three sizes...also unheard of in NY."}
{"text":"What a treat it was to dig into Mangia Mangia's gluten-free pizza!  Gluten-free pizzas can be a challenge to prepare and serve--thin gluten-free crusts easily get overcooked and brittle before sauce and cheese have had time to bake thoroughly.  On my visit to Mangia Mangia, they got this tricky formula right and at a price that beats the other restaurants I've visited.  I will definitely return to enjoy another one!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend to try Mangia Mangia on a Saturday, staff was very friendly and seating was plentiful at the time. The whole experience was Very good, from the hostess to the meal, the food was very tasty and servings were great in size. The only flaw I saw was a electrical outlet that was missing a cover and a child was sitting near it, they should fix it, no biggie. The Food again was Excellent. I will be back to try other foods here.  Sorry the pictures don't show much of the food but it was delish!"}
{"text":"My family and I have always enjoyed every meal we have had here. Love Friday Fish Fry!! Portions are large and prices are good! Staff is always friendly! Menu has a lot to choose from. Restaurant itself could use some updating and a good cleaning...especially the bathrooms but we still love it!"}
{"text":"Pretty much amazing! Try the chicken buffalo sandwich, chicken Parmesan, chicken cutlet with shelled macaroni noodles or the chicken pecan salad!"}
{"text":"My parents live not far and this is their go to spot. I've been numerous times. Everything is good there. The pecan salad is a huge favorite to share which is saying a lot because our family usually goes right for the carbs!"}
{"text":"Just really good food! Reasonably priced. Splendid Wild West BBQ chicken pizza. If you like garlic and are in the mood for wings, combine the BBQ and garlic sauces & you will be sure to say - YUM!"}
