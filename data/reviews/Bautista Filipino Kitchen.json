{"text":"Never again will go to this fast food ever!!!! No ahi poki, no halo halo come on why don't you just close your place!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 item combo. Got pork adobo, pancit and one grilled chicken skewer. The only semi decent part of the order was the pancit. It would have been better but it was semi cold just like the adobo. The adobo wasn't good. The meat was very hard and really had no flavor. Plus it was very salty. I make adobo at home and mine is super soft. Just melts in your mouth unfortunately theirs was the opposite of that. What really angered me was I also ordered grilled chicken. The problem is they only make it when it's ordered. I had already eaten my meal and I was still waiting for this chicken. When I got it twenty minutes later it was four tiny pieces and one of those was a chunk of fat! I guess if you're super desperate for Filipino food at least give this place a try but for sure stay away from anything that's grilled. Also don't bother with the boba, theirs a wait for that too."}
{"text":"This is more of a rebuttal and a little update to Bautista's K (the owner?) review since I was mentioned in it.
 
----\"As for Shirley B. - was very surprised to find this review redundant. As if it was to sabotage a business and give a review only on the 3rd day of \"soft opening\" -\"----

Am I understanding this right? I am being accused of sabotage? I sure hope not.
 I cant take this unwarranted accusation lightly and feel the need to address it.
 
I normally do write ups after a first visit to new places but my review was based after a second visit (2/10) to this place a week and a half later, not on the 3rd day of soft opening (Jan 30) that Bautista K comprehended. .  Go over and reread my review again, 4th paragraph where I mention my 2nd visit.
  
As for redundancy, I cant help that since both visits when I ate there, temperature wise, the food was not hot enough. Which by the way is fact since it was reflected in SNHD inspection a day later coincidentally after my review was written. Update:  I'm happy Bautista's  took proactive steps and corrected it and now rockin the A grade.

For the most part my review was positive as I mention food tasted good, prices reasonable and friendly staff. Some people think I'm way too nice and too generous with the ratings I dish out. Sorry you take the overall review as sabotaging your business but I still stand by my original review.
 
I sure hope the accusation is just a misunderstanding. All who know me know I am a big advocate and supporter for businesses in our community and only want to see everyone succeed.  Even your business here in Vegas Bautista K!  Happy to hear you are doing great with all the new dishes I see you are now offering  and possibly look forward to trying them one of these days."}
{"text":"me and a friend went there to Eat on feb 25 2014 and service was not so great. food was okay and  price of food was okay but I think its over priced for the portion of food they give you was way to little."}
{"text":"What Filipino restaurant charges $7 for HaloHalo, really?! Red Ribbon is less than $5. Might as well go to Thelma's across the street."}
{"text":"To pricey.. ordered spam masubi and Turon bites.. spam masubi the rice was to hard n I think the spam wasn't cook right. N the turon bite wasn't the turon I was expecting. .. so I give it a 2 for now.."}
{"text":"because they got butthurt about my original review...
theyre overpriced and unsanitary(:
-goodluck eating there."}
{"text":"It was around 6 pm dinner time and they were out of a lot of food.  I then decided to order something from the \"anytime\" menu which is mostly breakfast sfuff.  I figure I can wait for them to cook something from the \"anytime\" menu.  Well, the lady working said they weren't serving anything from that menu at that time.  Wtf????  Why do you have that on your menu then???  Get it together!!"}
{"text":"Their food sucks! Lumpia soggy. The dishes with vegetables in it salty.  And it's expensive.  Even the halo halo isn't so great either.  I'd rather eat at Thelma's. The food there much tastier and cheaper!"}
{"text":"Overprice, small portions and the poor young girl had no idea what the food was nor what was on it.. Sad because it tasted ok for local 671/808 chow ...."}
{"text":"Horrible! Don't waste your money! Halo halo was not even sweet not to mention over priced. Ordered siopao, and it had pieces of paper stuck to it. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Poor food and grumpy service. The Hawaiian BBQ place here previously rocked. Save the upset tummy and head over to another option like Kyklos Greek."}
{"text":"Not bad! I ordered the Sisig and Chicken Adobo (but the girl gave me Menudo ). Sisig was not what I was used to. The pork and tomatoes were cut bigger than I've normally seen. Both were good. Not as good as Moms home cooking but good. I will definitely be going back to try more. Try it out and support our Filipino Community"}
{"text":"My expectations are usually fairly low when eating in a mall food court. Decided to give this place a chance and wasn't disappointed. 

I ordered a mini bento box which was actually plenty of food. I was surprised to find the amount of flavor in the dish. You could tell that it was prepared with care and had a wonderful presentation.

Reasonably priced- overall enjoyable. Nothing special though."}
{"text":"A Filipino place at the mall? Cool! Overpriced and funky tasty food? Not so cool.

Really, who pays $6 for boba? I mean, that has to be pretty damn good boba for that price... Anyways let me tell you my beef with this place.

My mom, aunt, and cousin were craving halo halo and this was the closest thing to home besides Thelma's (which we aren't particularly fond of). There was only one worker there that day so I can forgive her for taking a long time for making the halo halo at least. The results were... well... Disappointing. The halo halo had no taste. I don't know how that was possible especially with the amount of things in it.

10-15 minutes after we got the halo halo our boba was ready. My cousin ordered a strawberry milk tea and I got a green tea. The teas had flavor but they didn't taste anything like what they were suppose to be. I'm baffled that a premixed drink took so long to prepare yet didn't taste right.

My mom ordered pancit from here too and whoever prepared it perhaps got carried away with seasonings. Ick.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they pick up their game."}
