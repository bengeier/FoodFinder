{"text":"Food quality is low..  price is high....
If the lobster at Congee queen is 8/10..  the lobster here is 3/10.

Do not order the fried chicken wings. Tasteless and very pricey. Walk a bit more to Spadina and have some popeye chicken."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Chinese restaurants in Toronto. We love the lobster in black bean sauce along with the fried pickerel in sweet and sour sauce. Everything I've tried there has been great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Miss this place since I've moved away from the city but I always come back when I'm home!
The ginger scallion lobster, saut√©ed baby bok choy in garlic and steam rice is usually what I have. The classics there...hands down theeee best in Toronto for this cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been a regular for 30 years, less frequently in the last few years as we have felt the quality has gone downhill. 
This will be our last time... 2 for 1 $39 lobsters were so small that they were difficult to eat. Once the meat was extracted it was chewy and tough. The General Tao chicken was heavy with batter and over cooked making the chicken tough. The snow pea pod leaves with garlic was good.. hard to mess up. 
I told the manager and his response was\" let me know the next time you come back\" then he quickly left. ???
This meal was from a few weeks ago but it has been on my mind to write a review especially since my friends who were regulars felt the same way about their meal a few months ago."}
{"text":"First time traveling down to Baldwin St after a long time. The last time I've gone here was to eat at 'Matahari Bar & Grill' (Malaysian Restaraunt). We had a voucher expiring soon, so we booked it the night before. To our delight, when we arrived, we mentioned we reserved a time, and they said they do not take any reservation. haha
But our voucher indicates so as well. Anywho, we waited for about 20 mins before being seated in a big table just the two of us...

Our $35 voucher allowed us to get any apps, a noodle or rice dish and double lobster sauce of our choice. We got the 'crystal shrimp balls', 'fried shrimp noodle chow mein', and 'black bean lobsters'.

The crystal shrimp ball was 7 pcs. It was a small meatball size with shrimp in it to compliment some sweet and sour sauce. Its decent, but not worth the original price they would charge customers for $16.95!

The fried shrimp noodle chow mein was not bad, but again not worth the price they charged of $18 or so.

The black bean lobster was surprisingly delicious as we've never tried this sauce before. My gf admitted that this was the best lobster sauce we had with this. They cut the pieces not too big, so it appears to have lots of pieces. Again, if you went there regular they would charge $30 straight for two lobsters. 

I don't know if that is good price, but across the same street I saw another restaurant promoting double lobsters for under $23! 

Based on the experience of this venue, it was decent service. The food is decent; except, the lobster was better than usual green onion ginger stuff. We still prob would not come back here just for the trouble of enjoying some black bean sauce with seafood...

btw: they have a lobster claw game where if you put $2 per try, if you catch a lobster doll, you can get a lobster cooked for you.!...Unlucky that day, b/c the machine was not operating."}
{"text":"They always have buy 1 get 1 for lobster special everyday. 
The ones that are saucey are $3 extra. It's worth it. Usually, 3 people with two lobster dishes and one fried rice should do the trick. 

One time, we were giving them 10% tip because there was no \"wow\" factor. But, we were stopped and being asked to tip more. This is unprofessional, because tipping is actually optional. After this incident, I actually didn't go for more than a year."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I am not a high maintenance diner in any way.  I have probably eaten in most of the restaurants in Chinatown and on Baldwin Street, and have never had a remarkably bad experience.  In fact, I have eaten at Wah Sing once before and was happy enough to return.  My experience at Wah Sing last night probably takes the prize for worst service I have ever had at a restaurant in Toronto.  
I arrived with a friend at 5:35pm, and even though the restaurant was mostly empty, the \"host\" asked us if we could leave and come back when the other two people we were meeting arrived.  After insisting that we did not want to go away for ten minutes, we were seated at an unmade table with a pile of menus and a pot of tea and ignored until about 6pm.   Ordering drinks was like pulling teeth:  it took about three tries to communicate that we wanted WHITE wine with enough glasses for everyone at the table.  
Finally we managed to order some food (after flagging down our server who was still determined to avoid our table) and then waited endlessly for all of it to arrive.  It would have been nice to get the fried rice at roughly the same time as the rest of the food, but that seemed like a minor complaint at that point.  The food, to the restaurant's credit, was good, but really not great.  You can get much better food for much less money on Spadina.  Soon after we finished eating we settled our tab (roughly $140 including tax and an admittedly small tip) and we got prepared to go.  While one of our group was in the washroom, our server impolitely asked us to leave because \"there are people waiting for your table\".  The restaurant was full at that point, but really???  

Anyways, I will not be returning and would not recommend Wah Sing to anyone."}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food.  They make the best ginger and green onion crabs/lobster.  So good sometimes they run out of crabs so call ahead.  Their Cantonese chow mein is perfectly crispy."}
{"text":"Lobsters lobsters more lobsters!
Try with their garlic sauce. Personally, it's better than the black bean sauce. Garlic sauce is to die for! Also pretty good fried rice. Do not expect very good service, though. Go for their food. I'd give 5 star if they have better surrounding."}
{"text":"If I was only rating the lobster this place would be 5 stars. I've never tried the black bean and have been going all my life with my family we always get the green onion ginger one. It's a treat because ofc lobster isn't cheap so tonight I just did take out of two orders of lobster for my dad's birthday and it was just over $80 (no rice nothing). The thing is the lobster isn't overpriced but I think everything else is. Mind u it's def good Chinese food. I can't eat lobster prepared any other way after that it's just so bland in comparison and even though this is very flavourful it doesn't overpower the lobster flavour-must try"}
{"text":"We just used our teambuy voucher for 2 people, on a Thursday night, 7:30 the place was packed even we called ahead for reservation, we had to wait about 15mins. 

I don't know why they gave Steph L. a hard time choosing the appetizer. We were able to pick our appetizer and rice/noodle dish from the menu. We ordered fried shrimp balls, Lobster with black bean sauce and seafood fried rice. The food was pretty good, they came all at once though so by the time we finished fighting with the lobsters (we weren't very good at shelling it), the rice was very cold. 

The staff were actually very friendly, after reading some of the reviews here, I didn't expect much service... so I was very surprised. Service was pretty slow though, since there were only 2 serving staff. Took about 30mins from the time we ordered until we got our food.

Parking was another issue. If you are lucky enough to find a parking spot behind the restaurant, make sure you get a permit from them. We weren't that lucky but there's a Green P not too far."}
{"text":"I agree with recent response, surprise this place didn't get 5 stars. The 5 times I have been here food has been great all the time. I love the ginger and onion lobster, sizzle oyster, crab meat&fish maw soup and shanghai noodles...I would reccomemd this place to everyone ;)"}
{"text":"The restaurant closed down 2 days after my visit for severe health code violations. Avoid at all cost!

{"text":"Never been one to eat out at chinese seafood restaurants, but my friends were adamant that we go try it, and I'm not sorry that I did.

Got there around 7:30 and our party of 7 were seated instantly.  We ordered a sea-food feast, and everything was VERY tasty; some even tastier from the higher-end restaurants I've recently had in the west coast for much higher prices believe it or not.  I normally don't eat cooked oysters but these tasted very fresh and the meat had a nice and firm texture to them.  The soft-shell crab was very very tasty as well.

Lobster cooked two ways (fried and steamed); also a steam fish + beef on a hot plate.  The lobster dish was HUGE; and again the meat tasted very fresh and firm.  Even the fried portions, you can taste the lobster meat; which is rare as a lot of other Asian restaurants that I've tried couldn't retain that flavour after cooking it with the same method.

Dessert was sorbet served in their respective fruits.  The coconut was to die for.  If I wasn't so full from the other dishes I could probably eat another few more.  Pineapple was also a good alternative has it served quite well as a palette cleanser after a big meal.

The service was pretty good.  Dirty plates from all the seafood dishes  were replaced fairly quickly with clean ones.  Monty, the owner, was very attentive to his guests.  He's got a wicked sense of humour to boot so it made for quite a jovial evening when he stopped by to have a chat.

All in all, would recommend to anyone wanting to try quality food in the downtown area."}
{"text":"We have been a regular for 30 years, less frequently in the last few years as we have felt the quality has gone downhill. 

This will be our last time ... 2 for 1 lobsters have creeped up to a whopping $46 and dish was so small that they were difficult to eat. Quality questionable ... Once the meat was extracted it was chewy and tough. 

This meal was from a few days ago but it has been on my mind to write.

Wah Sing, there are better dining options out there ... jacking the price AND serving less lobster is not a good combination!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place, loved it until almost 2 years ago, then the quality seemed to drop off enough to make it not worth it.I gave it 3 more chances in case it was a fluke, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I found this place! My mom's friend recommend this place. She told us the story about the brothers who open the restaurant next to each other (Wah Sing and Wah sang). Apparently, both are good. But we only try Wah Sing so far...

Must try the crab fried rice! I can eat that everyday! The lobsters was good but abit pricey considering the lobsters were not very meaty, even though it's 2 for $28."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Saturday night.  The service was EXCELLENT and lobster was fantastic! Best lobster I've had at a Chinese restaurant.  Would definitely make the trip downtown again just for the lobster.  I also had spicey shrimp, Cantonese chow mein and fried rice which were all good but I have to say the lobster is their best!"}
{"text":"We come here for the lobster special.  Price has gone up significantly over the past few months, but it's still good.  Clean, professional servers.  Good family spot."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Wah Sing for a few years.  I recently went back and the food isn't as good as it previously was.

The service was acceptable, however, we felt rushed into ordering.  We went late, 10pm and we were rushed to order as they were taking the final orders for the night and would not be able to get food after that.  If a place closes 11pm I would think you can enter or order until closing time.

We had beef with rice noodle - just OK.  The beef was not seasoned.  Spicy Pork Chop - that was a good flavor, hardly spicy though.  Braised grouper with bean curd in hot pot - terrible.  The fish was mushy and tasted like tilapia or another 'bottom feeder' fish.  We complained about this dish and the waiter tried telling us that it was grouper, but didn't really object to my suggestion too strongly, therefore leading me to believe that it wasn't.  They did change the order for us, had to decide on something in 5 seconds to replace it as they had that last order stipulation in play.  We got the Jumbo shrimp in lobster sauce.  The shrimps we surprisingly large which was good.  However, the food was lacking seasoning.  I had to be adding salt to flavor.

The pricing is expensive for barely satisfactory food.  For 30% less, I can eat at somewhere like Congee Queen with much better tasting food.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Great lobster place for family dinner!
Price was abit expensive but then again, its all about lobster so lol
Worth trying it out for once."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with family, enjoyed the food but mix-up with bill left a sour taste in my mouth and I refuse to return. I am also going to request a refund for my Buytopia voucher. I don't typically leave negative reviews but this one is a must. 

Story - followed normal procedures as outlined by Buytopia voucher (reservation, printed form, etc) Asked to order the 2 for 1 lobster deal for $29.99. Waitress asks for the first lobster flavor, we got ginger and onion she then proceeds to ask for the second flavor so we opt for black bean. Ordered e-fu noodles, fried rice, and watercress vegetables. Majority of food arrived in a timely manner with the exception of the second lobster so I inquire and the waiter checks. Informs us that the kitchen forgot and it would come out soon. No problem so far, got it and bam, finished. Food is delicious so we're happy. Bill arrives and I notice 2 of the lobster specials so I inquire with the waitress, she explains that is what we requested but I explained we asked for one special and not two. She immediately puts the blame on us and I questioned why she asked about a second flavor because there was no mention that a second flavor would constitute a second dish order but be implied it relating to the 2 for 1 deal. She implies that one dish consists of two lobsters and that its great we finished the food...at this point I've wasted enough time so bit my tongue and paid the bill. I'm truly disappointed with this business and will stick to the neighboring shop Hua Sang from now on. I recommend the food here but be wary of the bill..."}
{"text":"I went here past Sunday July 26th with my family for my mother's birthday dinner.
We've known this place since 10 years ago, and this was the first time that they really disappointed me.
First of all, it took them awhile to have us seated and get our order.
Then we waited more than 30min for three dishes.
Then when it came to our dishes, I noticed awhile after we started to eat that the owner made a mistake on our order.
We ordered two for one lobster deal $35.95 and two other dishes.
We specifically told the OWNER that we wanted half ginger and half black bean sauce.
However, they only brought the black bean sauce flavour.
When I pointed the mistake to the waitress, she went up to the owner and they only told me that two different flavour is additional $4 and we would have to order another lobster.
I clearly told the OWNER that I wanted to separate flavours and he did not even double check our order.
We really wanted the ginger flavour more than the black bean sauce.
I was very angry that the owner did not even recognize his mistake and come to apologize or offer any discounts to the menu or fix our order.
Their deal is good but the service is horrible.
The OWNER should really work on customer service if he wants people to come back.
Very disappointed.
There are a lot of restaurants that offer similar prices with better service, so I would not go back here again."}
{"text":"wah sing must have changed hands and cook. the switched from cloth napkin to paper napkin. they still play classical music. today we went to wah sing around 5:30 pm. it was not busy only 2 tables were occupied. we ordered lobster with black bean sauce, snow pea tips and soft shell crab fried rice.the fried rice was bland the crab was bland even the fish roe did not taste like fish roe. BECAUSE I AM NOT ADEPT IN USING CHOPSTICKS EATING LOBSTER I HELD IT WITH ONE HAND AND FORK WITH THE OTHER HAND. the biggest disappointment, the lobster was cold, shell and meat. cold like it came out of the fridge.. the sauce was warm. i brought to the attention of the server she insisted it was fresh and alive when it was cooked. she gave reasons why it is cold. it was cooked ahead of the order, the kitchen is in the basement and it is cold in the basement. i asked the server to feel the shell but she declined.she offered to warm it but i declined because i know once it is cooked and reheated the texture will get tough. actually the lobster lacked flavor. when i told her i will write a review her tone became conciliatory she offered to take away the lobster and will bring us a new one. i did not trust that the second will be better so i declined the offer. after we paid the bill i told the server that i know what happened the lobster was cooked ahead and kept in the fridge i just got unlucky that i got one that was not fresh. the bill came up to $ 72 for 2 person abig disappointment. next time i will go to higway 7 steels markham. as i am writing this review the thought came to me that it cooked ahead and hwas left sitting on the counter which is worse than keeping it in the fridge for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere.

The price was right. 
Not to much, just the right amount. 

I ordered lobster in black bean sauce which I pretty enjoyed but little bit strong flavour for me.
Next time I will try steamed one."}
{"text":"The food tastes more expensive than they actually are! Best seafood place ever. Their escargot and lobster are to die for! Super affordable!!! I give it 4 stars because the setting could be better. They have way too many tables cramped in the tiny place. It can be more loud and and seemingly too crowded than most chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there tonight.  As usual - well pleased.  Loved it.  I read another review on here saying that Hua Sang was better.  I disagree.  I have been to both as well a few times.  Wah Sing is better; and I like their dining room better.  There double lobster price is $35 this year; around that ball park anyway.   

Their prices are on the high end, compared to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, tried their famous 2 for 1 lobster special, one with black bean and the other with ginger garlic sauce.  Make sure you ask for a lot of napkins 'cuz it'll get pretty messy.  Also, don't order these unless you have strong teeth because it'll be difficult to get to all the meat if you don't chew through the shell and suck it out.  Definitely not a dish you want to order on your first date.  It was very so-so at best tastewise.  My kids love lobster but even they weren't too impressed.  Parking in the back is very tight and muddy!  You'll need a nice car wash afterwards.  But they give a card to put on your dash for free."}
{"text":"My family and I always enjoy eating here whenever we're in the area! 

We order a mix of different dishes at each visit but the one dish that's a MUST and we ALWAYS order is their lobster  if you like seafood then you'll really enjoy this!

We order it in a black bean sauce and it's just sooooooooo delicious! They chop it up in small easy to eat pieces and the whole dish is smothered with their black beans sauce! And yes, you must eat it with rice  soooo good!! 

The restaurant is a little on the small side but we always manage to get a table. Staff is very friendly and if you're new to the resto, they're very accommodating and good at making recommendations based on what you like. So next time you're in the area and like seafood, I'd say give it a try!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite(old wahsing), but this will be the last visit for me.
Meatless lobstar, terrible service and over overprice. 
They charge you fixed price for one pound of lobstar and when dish arrived, the lobstar was meatless. When we asked the server, she said \"depending on season. you will get more meat or less meat\" . Such a waste of money here . Dont visit if you are expecting old wahsing
I would give a zero star if i could"}
{"text":"Had the hot and sour soup and the 2 for 1 lobster combo with rice.
The hot and sour soup tasted authentic but did not have authentic ingredients, namely with its added green peas and bbq pork (char siu). the lobster was done in a ginger and green onion sauce, I was told this was the most popular version. I devoured the two lobsters by myself and its a bargain at $35."}
{"text":"We ate at Wah Sing today, and had Shanghai noodle and stir-fried beef and snow peas, for total of ~$40. Food looked and tasted okay overall.  The snow peas tasted good.  Beef and celery tasted not the freshest, but edible.

Not Just Noodles offer similar or better food for cheaper price.  Wah Sing's food was okay, not the best, not as sophisticated as e.g. Congee Queen, but it was okay.

Overall, we enjoyed the experience.  The place was clean and not too loud, and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but their quality has gone down the drain - I'm not sure if the owner changed. 

I went last night and the lobsters were terrible. The portions are much smaller now, and it is now overpriced ($50 for 2 style double lobster). There was barely any meat to eat.

To boot, every other dish we ordered was terrible as well. Fried rice, chow mein, sweet and sour pork, you name it. Nothing was fresh, and the food wasn't even hot.

I am never going back. Do not go here. They are not what they used to be."}
{"text":"Best lobster in town. Indian Chicken Is another great dish. The oysters in black bean sauce and everything else we enjoyed was really good! Great place for Chinese fare In Downtown Toronto. Wouldn't go anywhere else (Downtown) Wah sing loses two stars for less than friendly  service and boring decor. Final thought Booyah!"}
{"text":"Would prefer to give 3.5 stars.

A friend and I went for the 2-for-1 lobster special for $36. You can see the different preparations on the Wah Sing website (http://www.wahsing.ca/menus/double-lobster/). We ordered the Ginger and Green Onion for both. Originally wanted to make the second lobster with black bean sauce but to get a second preparation, it would cost $3 more. 

Ordered 2 bowls of rice and a side of Chinese broccoli (gai lan) to cut the heaviness and mix the sauce. Rice was standard price ($1.75?/bowl) but as others have mentioned...the veggies were ridiculously overpriced. $13 for a plate. And the veggies were just flashfried and were not seasoned with anything, not even soy sauce But back to the reason why we went: the lobster. DELICIOUS. When the lobsters arrived, the plate didn't look too big but when we were done, somehow our plates with shells looked bigger than the serving plate haha. Really good flavour and nice meaty pieces. Would've prefered a bit more sauce. If you don't like dealing with shells and digging around for meat, these lobsters may not be for you due to the way they are cut. 

Service was prompt and not much interaction. Not a big deal. Waitresses were polite. They didn't mind splitting our bill..

Be sure not to confuse with Hua Seng next door whose sign is bigger and also offers a 2-for-1 lobster deal."}
{"text":"Here is our experience with the Wah Sing Restaurant. We've started our dinner with the egg rolls that were OK (Mandarin style I like better). Then we've ordered 2 for 1 lobster for $28 and a deep fried shrimps for $17.  The lobsters had no meat in it and, in my opinion, they serve you only one lobster tail cut into small peaces instead of two. It's hard to say for sure since you get one plate full of shelfs. The deep fried shrimps were plain and not tasty at all. After finishing it we were definitely not full...
Anyway, I will not be returning to Wag Sing because the food was good, but not great and the waiting time for the food is a bit longer than I would expect (we waited 20 min for the beer)."}
{"text":"Came here on dinner during a weekday. It seems like most people that were here were using a team buy deal.

Had lobster, duck, tofu/vegetables, and fried rice. 

The good: 
The lobster which the restaurant is known for was amazing and definitely a must-get at Wah Sing.

The bad:
Of course being a Chinese restaurant, items don't come out of the dining room in any particular order.
Service is good for a Chinese restaurant but mediocre compared to more modern places.
Washrooms were renovated but a bit dirty."}
{"text":"Loved the lobster.  $36 for 2 and aeeved in a variety of ways. The popular one seemed to be with lack bean sauce. We got the garlic dry lobster. Just yummy with a ton of garlic. We also fat s dish if Chinese broccoli which was a tad too soft but still good. A bowl of rice was enough for both of us. I would love to come back to try the green onion garlic lobster."}
{"text":"We got the two lobster special with green onion and ginger. It was very tasty and pretty reasonably priced, but everything else is a bit over priced. The hot and sour soup was also really good, so many differnt things in it (bbq pork, mushrooms, shrimp, chicken and egg) but a bit too sour for our liking. 

Overall a good experience if you want to try Chinese lobster but nothing much else besides that."}
{"text":"we went to this place today. The food is good but the server was very rude. I paid in cash and was not prepared for more tip. The server was so mad and told me that I need to give her 10 -15% of how much we ordered. I  gave her like 6% tip and she was so mad with that. If that is their rule in this restaurant they should put it in their flyers or inside the restaurant and tell their customers so we can know and not eat there if we couldnt afford to give that tip. She just bring the food and tea and did not come back until were done. For me with her attitude she doesnt deserve a tip. so you guys dont go there if you couldnt tip 10-15% of what you ordered or you will be humiliated."}
{"text":"I love Baldwin so I love this place! 
Good lobster, good choice of seafood and none seafood items as well! Tried snail last time and wasn't disappointed, not sure if I would order it again tho, just too much work and not my thing! The prices aren't that mad ether, about average for seafood! Must get the lobster with batter!"}
{"text":"This place can get really busy. And the couple team were the only ones working (besides the cook) made it a bit slow of a service. I mean they were trying their best, but they can benefit with some help, at least to clean the tables. Anyways, the vegetable fried rice here was good. We ordered the spicy fried squid, and it was salty with no spice to it at all. The squid itself was ok but it was over-salted. 
We also had the fish maw soup which was good after I added some pepper to it. The baby Bak Choy was cooked really well, and it tasted really good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food downtown. Really good old school Chinese lobster. The whole vibe is very old school. Flavourful. Kitchen seems clean. Would definitely come back and is great for big groups."}
{"text":"Staff service is OK.  But that black bean sauce lobster dish is just mouth watering awesomeness. It's a must for those who want to check out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great option if you are craving lobster for their 2 for 1 lobster special. However, I don't like enough of the sides to make this a well-rounded meal. Too bad because Balwin Village is such a cute area."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! A little bit pricey but I mean, you're going there for lobster, right?? I loved the garlic and onion lobster. The lobster and black bean sauce was amazing too. And they won me over with their fried chicken wings, which are large, and actually meaty (and not full of breading!!). I always get their chicken fried rice too because it's awesome. And the people here are always so nice and they provide such great service!

Only weird thing is at my last visit, I think the owner and their family were eating there and it was such an odd experience! I assume they were the owners because they kept going in and out of the kitchen as if they owned the place. One of the older ladies at this particular table walked over towards the back and started yelling at the servers, complaining about the wait for their food. She didn't even bother to go up to them and tell them discreetly. And literally all the servers and the people in the back started scrambling. Anyway, that was the only part that put a bad taste in my mouth about this place. That there is a cute restaurant, in such a quaint little street, with amazing servers, great food, but tyrants as owners! If I'm wrong and they weren't the owners, then DAMN, these people took customer service to the next level!!!"}
{"text":"This place has basically what all Chinese restaurants have but what makes them stand out is their specialty which is the deep fried lobster (in the shell).

They have a ginger version and a garlic version and both are really good but I like the garlic version better.  

They usually sell the lobsters in a 2 plate form so you can get 2 full lobsters for something like 30 bucks.  

The round tables are the great if you have a larger party. 

If you've never had fried lobster ever, this place is worth it just to try it.

The rest of their dishes are basically average to average + what you would expect from a nice eat in Chinese place."}
{"text":"I went to Wah Sing for dinner a couple of weeks ago with a couple of friends. The last time I stepped into this place was over 8 years ago for their lobsters and I remembered it was different than most Chinese restaurants but in a good way. But a few months ago I bought a Teambuy voucher and looked forward to returning.

When I went through the reviews here and saw some of the low ratings, I was skeptical and wasn't very hopeful with my dinner experience, mostly expecting bad service and food being overpriced according to some??

But fortunately, none of this was true when we had dinner there. It was a warm, slightly breezy summer night. We arrived at around 8:30pm and the place inside well packed, so we took the tables in the patio, which turned out probably even the better choice as the inside did look somewhat old-fashion, dark, dingy and stuffy. Outside was perfect as it wasn't too hot, nor windy.

We ordered the double ginger and green onion lobsters, a Yeung-Chow/Cantonese fried rice, a beef rice noodle, and a plate of snow pea leaves. Like I said, I was ready and expecting something bad from the bad reviews here. But the lobsters came first, served on a long oval plate. The portions was huge. By comparison to some other Chinese restaurants, the quantity of lobsters looked like more than just 2. Anyhow, the lobsters was just as I remembered from 8 years ago, excellent. Their lobsters here are different than most places as I think it's the combination of spices they used and I think they were more deep fried than other places.

All the other items arrived and they were all well cooked and tasty. Everything was average price; fried rice at $9-10 and beef rice noodle the same. I especially liked the snow pea leaves as the quantity was pretty good; a full heap on an oval plate, while still priced at $12-$13, an average price for this dish.

The service was also great. Not sure if maybe because 1 server is specifically placed in charged to tend the 4 tables in the small patio (as opposed to being 1 of the closely packed tables inside). So we had no problem getting the server's attention for anything e.g. more water, more tea, extra bowls to share, etc. Our server was attentive, giving us extra napkins for our lobster mess without asking. She had gentle mannerism, never rushing or hasty. Whenever my friend make a request such as more tea, she always responded politely and a gentle 'no problem' whenever we say thank you.

So I am still puzzled at the low ratings here. I guess I can see how service may not be so great if I was sitting inside during peak hours. It's probably a more hectic environment for the servers inside. That's just my guess. I also didn't get any problems from using a voucher and we left a very good tip for the server.

Anyhow, I had a good experience and I will come back again, maybe next time for the their Tuesdays and Thursdays lobsters special.

Oh yeah, it's funny to see their competition next door 'Hua Sang'. As a person who can read Chinese, their names similar sounding and only differs in the second word. I got confused and almost went into Hua Sang. I do noticed they got good reviews here on yelp so maybe I will actually try their lobsters one day to compare with Wah Sing, and see if it's better like some reviewers claimed here :)"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the lobster special and it was ok. Nothing spectacular. We ordered the lobster in ginger and onion sauce, it was made differently than the usual stir fried way. Their version of it was deep fried and dry. i prefer the traditional stir fried saucy way. Along with the lobster we tried to order crab but they didnt do it the way we wanted to, so scratch that. We tried to order the crab claw appetizer, the waiter advised that it was not worth the price of $14 being that you only get one. So we settled with calamari in spicy salt, steamed oysters in black bean sauce and stir fried broccoli. Calamari was tasty despite the thick batter, oysters were old, I took a bite and stopped right there, and the broccoli lacked the \"wok hei\". The food was mediocre, service was good, and the food came out quick. Overall it was ok but I dont think I would come back."}
{"text":"Time Warp and Out-of-Town effects all in one at Wah Sing as I noticed that old school Hong Kong traditional GOLD lettering at the back of the restaurant while the other decor and setup reminds me of going to a Chinese restaurant in somewhere other than Toronto.   2.5 *Star*

Weird, our Teapot was there on the table before we even stepped inside the door. Also take note that the Automatic Towel Dispenser and the Automatic Hand Dryer in the Men's washroom is no longer on Auto Pilot. Just go wipe your hands on the Table Cloth when you get back. :D 

Crab Meat Shark Fin Soup($15+/Individual) was amazingly full of Shark Fin and a bit of Crab Meat. It was a spectacle that even I haven't seen at any of the recent Chinese style banquets I attended. I'm not trying to say my friends are cheap, maybe I am(?). 

Ginger Onion Double Lobster($28+) seemed PRICEY even while I'm looking at an ad on newspaper at one place Uptown stated for $16.95 but I guess Downtown is Downtown after-all. It was good as Lobster usually are in this preparation except I noticed the Lobster was a bit darker than usually which might be Soya Sauced that isn't normally an HK custom but nonetheless still A-OK. 

Fukien Fried Rice($15+) was ALMOST what it should be in the traditional sense except that there were no Scallops however they added Bean Sprouts(?). For $15 dollars I look for those Scallops even if its tiny Bay Scallops rather than Divers. 

By now you know I don't eat much Chinese Downtown as I complain about the authenticity and the price. My opinion stands while I'm not totally given this place a fail due to the fact I don't have much Downtown Chinese food experience. I'm just sharing my view hopefully some would be happy to read. :)

Btw, doesn't accept Credit Card under $20.00 purchases."}
{"text":"Ginger and onion lobster... need I say more? We've been eating here for over 10 Years. They've been pretty consistent with their food so we've come back time and time again for a lobster craving!"}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago for lobster, and was definitely not disappointed!
We ordered:

-2 orders of lobster (4 lobsters in total)
(Ginger and onion + one in black bean sauce)
-Rice noodle in black bean sauce
-Yeung Chow fried rice
-Plate of baby bok choy

All of the food arrived in appropriate time, and all tasted really good. I totally recommend ordering more lobster as it may not be enough with 1 order unless you're two people.
Service was prompt and the tea was always hot. Atmosphere was just right-not too loud and not too quiet. They have a big menu and have lots of different Chinese dishes to try. But the stand out for them is their lobster for sure! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Hot Pot Chicken please!

I know everyone raves about the lobster but since I don't really eat seafood, I thought I'd give this seafood restaurant a non-seafood review.

I will say that I first came here because my uncle raved about their lobster, and if this place can get my suburban, Chinese foodie uncle to leave the burbs and come into the city, it's worth a try.

He also raved about their hot pot chicken and he was right! I quickly became addicted and it's now a dish I crave often.

It's not hot pot, like the big pot of soup that you boil meat and veg in at the table. 

This hot pot chicken is crispy and coated in a soy glaze and served in a hot clay or metal pot. The first time I had it it was clay but recently I noticed it was metal.

I love it because the chicken is crispy but it's not battered. You get big chucks of quality chicken meat that's been dry fried and then coated in a glaze with green onions and ginger, a classic combo.

Chinese restaurants have all sorts of ways of using not so great meat, so when I say quality, I mean I can taste that the meat is fresh and isn't marinaded with loads of rice wine, cornstarch, and tenderizers.

A pot of chicken, a plate of snow pea shoots, and rice is all I need to be completely happy but the portions are family style so you may want to share that.

And if you've never had snow pea shoots you should definitely give it a try. It tastes like snow peas but without the roughage. It's just the leaves and stems of a snow pea plant. The greens should be picked before the snow peas grow so they're tender and delicious! 

The only thing that I don't like is they do the standard over charge for veg that most Chinese restaurants do because they know a meal isn't complete without a veg for most Chinese people. 

A plate of stir fried greens with garlic, while delicious shouldn't be $13,95, the same price as the chicken?

Well maybe for snow pea shoots it's worth it..."}
{"text":"Yesterday I called to order food. I asked for the price and I could not hear what the guy said so I asked again. Just because I couldn't hear the price, the guy at the front who is a cunt and doesn't know anything about customer service started being rude towards me and said he won't take my order. What a disgusting human being and terrible customer service. Never again"}
{"text":"This is got to be the worst restaurant we've ever dine in! The ginger and green onion lobster is dry and tasteless, fried rice is so oily, and the spicy squid has more of the colored chips than the squid itself. Service is also bad and to top it all, the waitress has the audacity to tell us that customers always gives 20% or more tip when we were paying the bill. In the end, we paid $93 worth of inedible food. Will not come back here for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese restaurant on Baldwin. Try their lobster in green onions."}
{"text":"I bought a teambuy voucher to try this place out 
\"$35 for two lobsters, appetizer up to $15.95 and rice or noodles up to $16.95\"
-you cannot choose your appetizer from the menu, only the rice or noodle dish choices are yours. They give you two springrolls or egg rolls which are $1.95 each. Not sure where the extra $10 comes from for the appetizer. 
-lobster came out within five minutes but was dripping in oil. It tastes like they had previously made it to prepare for the teambuy and re-fried to serve
-I'm Chinese (the servers did not know it) and could hear the servers trash talk  the table beside us in Cantonese 
-on a brighter note, the service was fast and efficient. They even force you to pay a tip that they have worked out and written on a piece of paper"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is the only place that I know of so far that iI can get great authentic chinese food. I'm not talking about places like Mandarin, because that is no where near authentic. I mean amazing traditional chinese food. 

The time I usually go to this restaurant is usually with family. My family absolutely loves chinese food and this is mine and their favourite place to go. Whenever we have family visiting or anyone visiting the GTA for that matter we always take them to this restaurant. 

When you enter the restaurant you'll see the reviews posted and pictures of some celebrites on the walls that have eaten at the restaurant. The service is amazing depending on who you get, the two younger servers usually don't seem to be in the mood to serve you at first but they eventually warmed up to you. While the two older servers are amazing, they're very quick, they like to strike up a conversation, and throw a joke in there from time to time. 

I would recommend this place for someone looking for authentic Chinese food, as well as for a family gathering either a birthday or some sort of special occassion. Btw I would definetly recommend that you make reservations if you are going there for dinner at 6:00pm or else you willl be waiting for a while.

Items to definetly get:

- lobster with ginger and garlic, did I mention its buy 1 get 1 free
- cantonese chow mein
- shrimp fried rice
- snails in spicy black bean sauce
- mixed vegetables
- crab and corn soup"}
{"text":"Had the two for one lobster with ginger sauce and the corn crab soup. Its good chinese seafood fair. The place was packed on a Saturday around 2pm. I enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"Quic and easy lunch. Ask for their lunch special for $4.50 meals. Typical Chinese food with decent portion sizes. Mostly rice.

Taste is okay - my beef brisket with vegetables may have been a little salty in the sauce but I enjoyed it.

Great value!"}
{"text":"For three people including myself, we ordered the two for one lobster special cooked with ginger and green onions. On the side, we also ordered Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice, Sauteed Baby Bok Choy, and Filet Mignon with Mixed Vegetables in Oyster Sauce. 

The lobster had a delicious garlic coating that went perfectly with the lobster meat. If you're not a fan of strong garlic tastes, then this might be overwhelming for you. The only downside was that the shells were very hard and difficult to break through. The Soft Shell Crab fried rice is cooked with many pieces of soft shell crab and topped off with flying fish roe (Tobiko). We always order this fried rice whenever we visit Wah Sing because of how delicious it is with the tasty soft shell crab, definitely a must-have if you're ordering fried rice. Baby bok choy is always a great vegetable dish to have on the side. This also had a delicious garlic taste and a nice crunchy texture. The filet mignon was very juicy and tender with rich flavours from the oyster sauce. 

The only thing that Wah Sing could improve on is to not overcook the lobsters which make the shells really hard. With that being said, for those who've been to Wah Sing, you will find another seafood restaurant called Hua Sang located just next door downstairs. They offer almost the exact same menu but their main difference is the way they cook their lobster. You will notice how much more softer the lobster shells are and how much more juicier the meat is. We usually dine at Hua Sang, but once in a while we like to visit Wah Sing to eat their Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice which they don't have at Hua Sang."}
{"text":"One of the longest standing Chinese restaurant in Toronto, this place I will never get sick of!

Went here for dinner for my boyfriend's Dad's bday. We went to make a reservation just in case but they said to just walk in which was sweet!

After we got seated, we ordered the fried stuffed bean curd, spicy soft shell crabs, yang chow fried rice, saut√©ed veggie, and the star of the show and pretty much 100% of the tables in the restaurant had the lobster in garlic and green onions sauce. The lobster is a 2 for the price of one special! Good for 4 hungry people. The lobster is super meaty and not over cooked, the sauce is soo freakin good! The fried bean curd was crispy not oily and stuffed with ground shrimp. I LOVE THE SOFT SHELL CRAB! You get two in one serving. It is so crispy and flavorful! The rice was mediocre nothing special. The saut√©ed veggie were tasty and full of garlic which I appreciate! I recommended everything I've mentioned if you'll be visiting for your first time. 

At the end they give you a hot towel and the sweetest oranges ever...I'm drooling over here! And you can't forget the fortune cookies

The service was super fast! From the time we got seated to the time we left the restaurant it was less than an hour. Great for big parties! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My lobster tasted like its been dead for very long time and i ended up having a stomachache. The seafood fried is bland and tasteless. Will definitely not come back again"}
{"text":"We've been going to Wah Sing for more than 15yrs albeit we only go 2-3 per year as we live in Richmond Hill. It's a small and cozy establishment. We love the food, it's tasty and we are always satisfied afterwards with the dishes, especially the lobster.

And we usually get the same dishes:
1) Snails in black bean sauce...tasty and saucy with chili, great with rice!
2) Lobster with ginger and onion...very tasty expect to eat with your fingers.
3) Boneless Steamed chicken but unfortunately they don't offer this anymore...so now we opt for the Crispy chicken or the Schezaun chicken
4) Watercress
5) Deep fried squid
6) Chicken in hot pot

Prices have gone up over the years but then again, hasn't everything else. The thing with Wah Sing, we know what we are getting and it's consistently good. 

My only issues are parking can be challenging, the beer is never cold enough, and the dessert can be different (it's always been oranges and fortune cookies).

The servers have been the same over the years and most are generally friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to be the go to spot for lobster. All year round they would have double lobster special cooked in your choice of 12 different styles. The classic ginger and onion is whats its known for. Service here is generally good because they deal more with western customers. Prices are high for asian cuisine, but the kitchen sure whips out food that has the \"fire of the wok\". Parking can be a hassle also during the day, definitely recommend coming here for late snacks."}
{"text":"You go to Wah Sing for ONE THING:

Chinese fried LOBSTAH.

Yup. 2 for $35.

Deliciously fried lobster is all yours. I recommend the Ginger and Onion and the Black Bean. Don't be shy pick it up with your fingers and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I don't know why no one really gave Wah Sing 5 stars. This restaurant has been in business for 30 years now so it must be good, right?

My sister and I decided to take my parents out for dinner in Toronto because it's been a while since we all went downtown. We arrived around 8 pm and it was full with a few people waiting in line. However, the wait wasn't long because the servers were fast at clearing the tables and prepping it.

What you definitely must try at Wah Sing is their lobster! We love seafood and this place and/or Hua Sing always satisfies our cravings. Their ginger and onion, and black bean sauce lobster dishes are sooooo good! I find it a bit difficult to get the meat out in the ginger lobsters but just biting on the shells is so satisfying and yummy that I could swallow the shells. The black bean sauce is awesome, so make sure you order a bowl of rice so you can drizzle it with the sauce. We also ordered a small bowl of fish maw soup with crab meat and it was delicious! However, I didn't really see or taste any crab meat in it (cheaping out, maybe?). A small bowl of soup can serve up to 8 people. My family loves to add red vinegar to the soup, it adds a little zing to it.

Since it's their 30th anniversary, they have a deal on Tuesday and Thursday where the lobsters are only $22.95. On the other days, they have the buy 1 get 1 free promotion for $27.95. At first we thought we were going to get 4 lobster dishes/8 lobsters(too optimistic?). The server told us that we would only get 4 =(.

The bill came up to $90.07 (before taxes), not bad for a family of 4."}
{"text":"Overpriced chinese food made for white people and tourists. Good service since we spoke the Cantonese to the servers. Lobsters were ok but way overpriced."}
{"text":"TOOLONGDIDNTREAD?: If you're looking for the old wah sing, look elsewhere. High price, low quality food.

Food: we ordered the seafood fried rice, two double lobsters (black bean & ginger), and the water cress. Food was alright, but definitely not worth the price. I used to go here years ago. The restaurant has changed a lot. Lobster does not taste fresh, tasted like frozen lobster. Watercress and fried rice was alright. 

Service: decent service for a Chinese restaurant LOL

Parking: lotta parking lots around the area."}
{"text":"Wah Sing used to be one of my favorite places to head for lobster.  My friend and I went for lunch today and I can only say that we were both very disappointed with our food.  We odered wonton soup to start.  The broth was tasteless and the wontons were lackluster.  We had lobster and ginger, cantonese chow mein and yang chow fried rice.  All the dishes arrived at the table cold.  It tasted like someone did a lot of cooking yesterday and didn't bother to heat it up.  Everything was tasteless and quite mushy.  Don't know what happened at Wah Sing but I know I won\"t be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I bought a Teambuy for a lobster dinner for two; included in the Teambuy is a lobster dish consisting of 2 lobsters, an appetizer (up to a $15.95 value) and a rice/noodle dish (up to a $16.95 value). I called 2 times over the past month to try and book a reservation (none of the dates I tried to book were black out dates) and each time they would ask for a bit of information (i.e. name, time, number of people, etc). They would then ask \"are you using the coupon?\" and after I indicated I was, they would say \"Oh no, we're not accepting the coupon on that date.\" On the third try I was finally able to make a reservation.

I showed up with the Teambuy and proceeded to place my order. One thing to note, there are no appetizers valued at $15.95 or rice/noodle dishes at $16.95. I tried to order a specialty rice dish, which was less than $16.95 (Ying Yang fried rice) and was told I could only order a regular rice dish. No where on the deal does it say that you can't order a specialty rice dish. The waitress went to put in the order and took my ticket. After 10 minutes or so, she came back and said that my ticket had already been used. I asked her to try again and she tried another 3 times. At this point I was furious, but there was nothing I could do because the Teambuy office had closed for the day. I told her to cancel my order and I decided to go somewhere else to eat.

I called Teambuy the next day and they checked to see when the ticket had been used and it turned out that the restaurant had redeemed the ticket while I was there! They had tried 3 times to scan it in and apparently the first time it worked. Teambuy is looking into the issue and I should have a resolution in a few days; I really appreciated how responsive Teambuy was. With respect to Wah Sing, it could have been a simple mistake, but all the interactions I've had with the restaurant have been less than optimal so I'm inclined to believe this may have been intentional."}
{"text":"The lobster was really really good. The other dishes weren't anything special. The server was really rude and not very accommodating. We bought a 2 person voucher, and called in WAY before hand to make sure we could switch it to a 4 person option and pay the difference (which was also on the voucher) but the lady kept saying \"no no no no no no\" while we were trying to explain the situation. They ended up not giving it to us."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. A friend celebrated his birthday here. The lobster and the snails were excellent. 

Definitely will come back here. Very reasonable asian seafood joint."}
{"text":"Have been here only 3 times in the past 15 years. The lobster deal is good. $35 for two. The only thing that bugs me is the cost on the side dishes. I would go back but not all the time. 

I do recommend it for the lobster deal."}
{"text":"Its good :) - WiFi password is the phone number BTW. The SSID is WIFI. Lobster is the must have"}
{"text":"Pricey and the food was not so good.
The nine of us ordered the buy one get one lobster for $28 and a couple of other dishes.  The lobsters had no meat in it and we were definitely not full, which is surprising, since our total bill was $200. Honestly, their portions are way too small. The food tasted okay, nothing too good. I could have had waay better food from Congee Wong.

The service was very unfriendly, and considering how we had 30 people that day, giving them so much business, they definitely didn't feel like they appreciated us being there. I've had way better Chinese food (come on, we are in Toronto after all) and they definitely could have done better catering us."}
{"text":"to celebrate the 30 year anniversary (damn 30 years? place opened up when i was born) this place is offering on tuesday and thursday 2 for 1 lobster @ $22 and change. hard to resist such a sweet deal for blackbean lobster. Then you add in some snow pea leaves (Dow Miu), softshell crab fried rice, and beef ho fun and now you got yourself a party!! I didnt see how the food stands out from other chinese restaurants, but the dishes were satisfying. Food came out fairly quickly and service was good. large groups will need to book reservations or else risk waiitng in line and having to watch people suck on those lobster claws. street parking is a problem in the neighbourhood cause there are so many restaurants squeezed into that little area so i suggest downloading the Green P app."}
{"text":"We came here on the weekend ot eat the Lobster (we had black bean flavored). My fiancee who is Korean really enjoyed the meal, but for me, I would still prefer my lobster grilled and dipped in garlic/butter. Was not a huge fan. 

We also ordered some Chinese Broccoli and it was cooked well, but I have still had better. Service was very good, but considering the price, I personally wouldn't return for the food. Since my fiancee seems to enjoy it very much and wants to return with her friends, I give them an even steven 3 stars!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the first time last night. I had high expectations because of all the positive reviews.  We were quite disappointed. We had the green onion and ginger lobster. It was very dry and one of the lobsters was so small that I thought I was eating a crab claw rather than a lobster claw.  The fried chicken and the spicy pork chops were also quite dry. The grouper and tofu hotpot was the only decent dish of the ones we ordered. The service was friendly and we were seated promptly at the time of our reservation. All of the issues related to the food.  I will not go back again."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at this restaurant. Most recent visit, I found that the quality of food wasn't quite up to expectations. 
We loved the ginger and onion lobster and soft shell crab fried rice; always got these two dishes every time. This visit, soft shell crab fried rice was bland, very little crab, and no fish eggs like usual. It's a $17 for the fried rice and it wasn't up to usual standard. 
Lobster dish was still flavourful but salty and not as fresh.  
Cantonese chowmein was OK, not amazing or bad. Mixed seafood fried rice is also a bit bland today. We had some sort of corn soup; my family liked it. Sizzling beef is flavourful.
Staff are friendly and efficient, good service for chinese restaurant standard. Overall, disappointed with recent visit. Hopefully this was just a one time incident"}
{"text":"Had a celebratory dinner here a few months back with the family. My mom recommended this place after having plenty of business dinners here! 

The garlic lobster we ordered was out of this world! Seriously delicious.

I took a star away because of the uninspired decor...but I guess it's expected."}
{"text":"Old fashioned Chinese restaurant. We went there for its famous lobster dishes. A bit disappointed compare to what we have in Richmond Hill and Markham."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  Been going to this place for years - since my university days - and I've never reviewed it.

When they say Chinese style lobster, most people say Wah Sing!  Off and on - I agree with them.  They can be Hit and Miss sometimes.

Wah Sing has a long history on food trendy Baldwin near UofT and Chinatown.  I remember the day when the dine-in two lobster special was near $20, now it's over $40.

The lobster comes two way, the Ginger and Onion, and the Black Bean.  I prefer the G&O because the BB is messy, however, the BB sauce is delicious and make a great mix with the steam rice.  To each their own.

Besides the lobster, go with the seafood mostly - the mussels, clams, and fish.  Their chicken and beef dishes have always been less than stellar.  The vegetables are good but expensive.  If you like soup, the hot and sour is pretty decent.

Parking is an issue, they have about 8-9 spots behind the restaurant, it's tight and fills up quick.  After that, you are at the mercy of the streets.

Not a place that I frequent a lot anymore - I live in RH and it's tough to go downtown, but when I do end up in T.O., I do go here.

Cheers!"}
