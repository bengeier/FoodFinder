{"text":"This was the second restaurant in Las Vegas that was supplied with one of the winners of Hell's Kitchen. Even though the winner, \"Rock\" Harper had already departed, we still wanted to check it out. It's a twin of Terra Rossa at Red Rock Resort-pretty much the same overpriced menu which shouldn't be surprising since both Executive Chefs were born in Milan and worked some of the same places through their careers.  We had no problems getting in without a reservation even though it was about 7:00 on a Friday night. The atmosphere and décor of the restaurant were very nice and gave it a romantic feel, but the lights were so dim we had to use our cell phone flashlights to read the menu. The romantic feel was dispelled by our wait staff. Although prompt and courteous, they were a bit stuffy, almost to the point of being snobbish. Green Valley isn't the upscale, trendy neighborhood it once was so they need to adjust to their clientele.  While you're waiting for your food, you get the standard bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar along with a plate that has a selection of cheeses, olives, peppers and zucchini chips. If you like the harder cheeses like parmesan and Romano (we do), you'll enjoy this while you wait for your food. We skipped the starters and went straight for the main course. Our waiter gave us that \"cheapskates\" look. We may have needed flashlights to read the menu, but the look on his face was plain as day. If you think we're cheap now, wait until you see your tip! Don't be a putz. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in town to visit.  I ordered the wild mushroom risotto and Brenda had the veal parmesan. The risotto was tasty and seasoned, but somehow I was expecting something a bit more. The portion size was ok, but certainly didn't fill me up. I think a smaller portion served as a starter would be better than the undersized dinner portion that cost $30. Brenda's veal also had good flavor and although the portion size was correct for dinner, it was a bit on the tough side.  Being underwhelmed by dinner, we skipped dessert and headed over to Starbucks for a couple of lattes. Although the food was good, it just wasn't good enough to justify the price--especially for a local's casino. It might be good to check out, but there are plenty of other Italian restaurants in Vegas whose food is just as good but at a better price."}
{"text":"So very, very sad & disappointing! $42 Chilean Sea Bass? Nope! $6 tilapia & the manager argued with us as if we had no idea of the difference.  After waiting 90 minutes they plopped down a piece of dried tilapia & 3 stalks of asparagus & called it dinner. Once confronted, they offered to buy us dessert. Dessert? Hell, I'm still waiting for the sea bass I ordered & paid for! Used to be a good to great restaurant...not anymore."}
{"text":"1 star for wine selection. Nice pinot noir from Willamette Valley!  1 star for appearance. Beautiful, warm lighting and decor.   1 star for quickness. Food was out within 10 minutes. Maybe too quick?   No stars for flavor. Chicken Marsalla was bland and what kind of Italian restaurant serves that kind of dish a la carte?   Service was fine, nothing memorable. Not worth a star.  Patio looks great and has misters, I'll try Terra Verde again to sit outside for lunch or coffee."}
{"text":"I live in the District Condos. Eating at Terra Verde occasionally I have had no problems. I ate there with my girlfriend on the evening of March 24th. The next morning I had the worst food poisoning I have ever had. I am a 6-5&amp;quot; 230 lb man and this brought me to my knees, literally, for 2 days. When I contacted Jerry the manager any the restauraunt he was very nice saying they would look into it and get back to me. They offered no refund on the dinner and to date has not called me back.        I would NEVER eat there again. The restauraunt was almost empty the night we ate there and they must be cutting corners. The health board was notified.  My advise... Stear clear of Terra Verde and go to Hanks or Presidio. I have only had food poision 3 times in my life and this was by far the worse."}
{"text":"Came for dinner to celebrate my birthday tonight! Everyone gave us awesome service from the hostess to our server - Tony, and the busboy! The appetizers were great, especially the shrimp scampi! Our dinner & dessert were delicious! We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and family! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"As my family and I was passing through the Palais des Congres de Montreal building, we came across this food shop. We had the pizza, soup and salad and all were wonderfully made and tasted great!! The staff is so helpful and friendly too! The pizza selection was very good and all ready made. When ordering, they put it in an oven for a quick heating. The pizza crust is superb!! This place was a great blessing for my entire family. Very good prices too!"}
{"text":"Wife and I ate there the other night and was very impressed with the atmosphere. The antipasto plate served before dinner was excellent,  had a spinach ravioli  that was really quite good, one of the best i have had actually, she had the seafood angel hair and i don't like that dish usually but still like hers too, the wine dispensers are a cool novelty. really a must try at least once."}
{"text":"The osso bucco is fantastic! Also love the zucchini chips. Pleasant atmosphere & very good service."}
{"text":"This place is great and is definitely going into my rotation of Las Vegas restaurants.  We went on a Tuesday night, so we decided to order from the prix fixe menu.  For our first course, I chose Caprese - fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and basil.  It was wonderful!  My husband had Pasta E Fagiole - a cannellini bean soup.  It was very good.  We really did not need a first course though, because a tray of peppers, cheese, olives, artichokes, and bread was served once we ordered.  Everything was sooooo good!  For our second course, I chose the rigatoni with spicy sausage and cream sauce and my husband had lasagna.  Both were very good, but I think the lasagna won.  We counted 9 layers of the thinnest, most tender lasagna noodles we have ever had.  The third course was dessert.  I chose the lemon angel cake with berries and my husband had the chocolate decadence.  The cake was a little dry, so the berries were needed.  The chocolate decadence was wonderful.  With the fixed price menu, you get a $10 wine card.  My husband wanted a beer, so I had $20 on my wine card.  They have a wine serving system where you buy wine by the ounce, so I was able to try 3 different wines with my dinner.  Very fun way to drink wine!  With everything, tax & tip, we spent exactly $100 for two with a three course meal and drink.  For a wonderful meal in Las Vegas, we thought it was an incredible deal!  I would go back even if they did not have the prix fixe menu - it is really good!  Some have reviewed that the service was bad, but we had absolutely no issues with our service!"}
{"text":"We were going to the buffet , but the line was so long . We just went in the first restaurant we found. I should have checked the menu , cause the food is expensive for an Italian restaurant.         It is impressive with the bread basket and anti pasta tray it had fried zucchini , roasted peppers , olives and a chunk of parm cheese.  I had the lasagna which was very good , it had a meat sauce and béchamel sauce and thin pasta which made it very tender . My brother had the clams pasta in a white wine sauce it had alot of fresh clams. Mom had the spaghetti n meatballs. Everyone enjoyed there meals, service was prompt.  Even though the food was good I don't think the value was there . Lots of other good italian restaurants that don't abuse your wallet."}
{"text":"Went there this past thursday (for my 40th yikes) and the restaurant was beyond our expectations. being a station casino employee, this reveiw may seem biased but i assure you it's not. the one thing that struck me repeatedely about this place was how clean it was. from the walls to the little holder for the sugar. everything was spotless. our server 'Bull' first got us our drinks, i actually got the the sparkling wine (first choice on the menu) my wife had a white wine as we sampled the free munchies and bread. i ordered the caesar salad which was perfect, my wife got the minn. soup which had very fresh vegs. and broth. i ordered the clams and linguine and my wife had the sea bass. both came out on time and was simply fantastic. the sea bass was so fresh and incredibly tasty. i ordered my linguine with parm. cheese on the side as i like this dish with a lot of cheese on top. for dessert, we got the terra misu (sp) and it came in a little dish. it had about 4 layers and the taste was equally great.   just a pleasant dinner and would return very soon. i don't think you can go wrong here.  oh, and the night we were there...we couldn't see Rock...however, we were off to the side..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had high hopes for Terra Verde. We recently moved in the area of GVR and how fantastic it would have been to have a wonderful Italian restaurant right up the road. However our experience with the food wasn't enough to leave us wanting more.  We started with an appetizer that was on the weekly specials menu, prosciutto wrapped figs with burrata mozzarella. I enjoyed the fact that the figs were fresh but they lacked flavor. The creamy burrata made it an odd combination.    Next was a caesar salad. Nothing out of the ordinary. Its hard to mess up a caesar. It was refreshing and crisp.  For our entrees my husband had the costoletta alla ghiottona which is basically a veal chop with prosciutto, and braised kale(a type of green) and I had tagliolini ai frutti di mare which is a pasta dish with shrimp, lobster, scallop, clams, mussels in white wine sauce. Sounds amazing right! But not at all amazing.  The veal chop was a large portion that wasn't properly cooked. It was cooked to medium and over salted to the extreme. It could have been from the salty prosciutto but still it was just too much. Braised kale is nothing to write home about it is an awkward texture with an even more awkward flavor. The dish looked beautiful stunning even, but the flavors were lacking, dry and salty veal chop for $42  My dish must have been waiting on the expo line for the veal chop to cook because when it arrived it was visibly dry and the pasta had become cold and sticky. There wasn't a trace of sauce it seemed to have been absorbed into the pasta. The seafood was all miniature I have never seen a mussel or a clam that was so small. The lobster was tuff and also dry, but the two dime sized scallops were somehow moist and not bad. Not at all worth $35  not even close. Unfortunately I have had better at Red Lobster.   The service overall was disappointing. The waitress came to see how our food was and I told her about my dry foo and she said \"Oh?\".... that's about it though. I saw a female manager walking around but she never stopped at our table or any of the other tables around us.  However there is a best part of Terra Verde and perhaps its saving grace, their wine menu. You can sample different wines by the ounce for a few dollars. You are able to taste a bottle before you buy or just have several glasses of wonderful varietals from all over. All of the wine tasting we did was probably what brought our bill to $240 The wine menu is what made this a three star instead of a two star review.  If you do end up going to Terra Verde go for their wine. They have a happy hour we saw going on while we were there. Unlimited glasses of Chateau ste Michelle red and white and unlimited appetizers for $25  There was a large crowd there for the happy hour they seemed to be enjoying themselves.    I wish this could have been a better rated review but I hope you find it helpful."}
{"text":"Wow! What a perfect place for a romantic date night! We were seated at a table not far from the cozy fireplace. The dimmed lights and simple but classic decor created the perfect atmosphere for an intimate evening. Our waitress (although a bit robotic) was very attentive to our needs during our meal. The menu has a nice variety of classic italian dishes. Everything sounded delicious, but I decided on spaghetti bolognese. It was outstanding! I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I know there was nothing (and I mean nothing) left on his plate afterwards - he loved it! Overall a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.  PROS: +Best antipasta plate I've every had. The zucchini chips were amazing! +Outstanding wine selection  CONS: -Expensive -Had to wait 30 minutes for a table even though many were open. -The appetizers outshined the main courses.  BOTTOM LINE We will give it one more chance, but we will order double appetizers and skip entrees. However, if we have to wait for a table again when we can clearly see open tables that are not reserved, I will give it a one-star rating and not eat there again."}
{"text":"Was at GVR and wanted a sit down meal that was not the buffet and went to Terra Verde for dinner (6:00 on a Saturday). Got right in and that's when the experience went down hill. We were put at a table off the bar area but not in the dinning area. It was no mans land. We had to flag down servers to order, refill drinks, get bill, etc. We would of had a better time in the food court.  The food was OK at best. It might of tasted better if we had better service or any service. I would never go back again!"}
{"text":"We do not leave the Green Valley Ranch (GVR) without our special dinner at Terra Verde. From the wonderful hostess, AnaDaisy with a welcoming smile to our \"regular\" waitress, Elise this place is top notch! Every attention to detail is made to accomodate their guests!  Last week we brought my parents (from Long Island) with us and they exclaimed it was a meal fit for a King and \"Queen\"!  My parents split the Ceasar Salad the the Pasta of the Day: Orchiette Pugliese. I had the Veal Saltimbocca and my husband had the Swordfish.  I tried one of the signature drinks, the Lemon Drop and it was heavenly!  Dessert choices are amazing so we split the Chocolate Peanut Butter Layer Cake and Pistachio Ice Cream.  It is nice to be able to enjoy such delicious food in a serene atmosphere and when done be able to walk right into the GVR casino or outside to The District to get a few steps in!  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've come to realize that Las Vegas has world renowned dining, but seemingly only on the strip.  Most restaurants in the Green Valley area are nothing special giving you no real reason to return.  This is another one.  We came in around 9:30-10:00pm on a Friday night.  It was totally dead.  A few tables finishing up.  The hostess asked if we had a reservation and then wrote our name down...like it was busy!?  We then got seated.  The service was pretty good.  The guys pouring water and bussing the table were on top of things.   But then again, it was dead and that's their job, so.... We got a Caprese salad which was tasty but overpriced.  I ordered the shrimp with rapini in a white wine sauce.  It wasnt bad, but it wasnt great either.  Just kinda blah.  No real distinctive flavors.  The rapini was cooked perfectly though.  My husband got the lasagna and again, nothing special.  It had a bit too much meat in it and the noodles were super thin.  But again, it wasnt horrible.  Overall, it was exactly as the rating says.  Meh, I've had better.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow, Terra Verde, located in the convention center, is quite a find!  The food is delicious and was ready quickly.    Terra offer breakfast and lunch and are open most weekends.  I didn't expect to find food this good in the convention center and was quite surprised at how delicious the chicken is.  I have also overheard that the fish is delicious too.  They offer a wide variety of salads and other healthy foods for lunch, in addition to a full breakfast menu.    The service was great, and everything was done with a smile.  I'm definitely eating here again if the chance arises.    Also - they are one of the only restaurants in the area to accept American Express."}
{"text":"Phone number listed on yelp site goes to voice mail of marketing manager of GV Ranch. WTF, real downer when you want to make reservations. Went for new years and had one of the best meals. Husband had veal chop ,which he has eaten in almost every LV restaurant, and enjoyed this the most. My Osso bucco was so flavorful, just wished they had smaller fork for the marrow. Service was great, only problem we were seated near the patio door, and we were cold."}
{"text":"Great food and nicest owner and staff! Went there for lunch and had great quality homemade food! Delicious! Greatly recommend"}
{"text":"Friday wine up 5-7 pm: $20 for all you can drink wine and all you can eat apps. The apps vary and are average but to try different wines or have as much of one as you want all for $20 is definitely worth it. There were 4 wines to choose from and there are no longer raffles as advertised but the atmospheres classy and fun plus the outdoor seating is nice. Arrive early enough to get a good seat and maximize your value. The service is attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a calm, relaxing place to chill and have some vino then this will work great.  They have a decent, if not large, selection that works with a pre-paid card.  I like it because I can hold onto my card and reuse it.  The appetizers are yummy good and the prices are better than at the Hostile Grape in the M."}
{"text":"I'm a local to this place, I took my little sister Molly here and she went berserks when she saw chef rock (i had no clue) she looks at him and squeaks out 'Hi!' and he says hello in his chef whites, she squeaks out another line, 'I'm your biggest fan!' and he continues 'I'm your biggest fan, thank you' then she educates me as of who he is, the winner of hells kitchen. He was very personable as all of the staff was and quite attentive.   Now to the food, the sauces are where its at for this place. Their caesar salad is always perfect, and a great sauce. Each time you visit they bring out a nice fresh bread selection as well as an antipasta dish. Their pizzas are a little, not what im used to, but their fish, pasta and meats are good and the sauces accompanying the dishes is what makes it..  My dinner tonight, caesar salad, breads, and dessert with sparkling water and limes. :)"}
{"text":"This place is located in the Palais des Congres de Montreal. It serves paninis, pizza, salad, and some cooked caseroles of meat. I had several paninis here and they all tasted good. The chicken soup was just OK. It's a smal eatery and it can get crowded during a convention. Come early if you can. The staff was generally courteous and accommodating. They accept America Express cards."}
{"text":"Booked a romantic valentine dinner for 8:15pm this evening. Played some slots and waited for the big draw before heading to the restaurant at about 8:20pm. Waiter seemed pretty disorganized, had to prompt him for the specials and  the wine list. I ordered a soup to start, followed by the pasta with spicy sausage, my wife ordered the shrimp risotto. Everything started out pretty well. Wine was fine and soup was tasty, waiter also delivered some bread and anti-pasta. Some of the bread was a little stale, but no worries because we didn't want to eat it ahead of our entree. Entrees arrived before I had finished my soup and waiter did not clear our table. I looked at my watch has we left and realized our romantic meal had lasted less than 40 minutes. No time for romance or chat. Food was ok, but very hot - had it been micro-waved? Surely not for a $$$ menu. We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"The service just rubbed me the wrong way.  We came in at 10PM on a Friday night, and the place was pretty dead.  There were 5 of us, and we were told to wait in the bar area while they put our table together.  REALLY hot bartender named mario made me forget how hungry I was ... for a few minutes.  But then I started looking at things other than mario and realized that there weren't very many people in the place, and I saw plenty of open tables.  Then the manager comes up and starts chatting with us about a bunch of nothing for a really, really long time.  Seriously manager dude, i'm hungry.  Stop talking.  Serve me food.  So we are finally seated about 30 minutes later (not exaggerating).  They put down an appetizer platter type thing with chucks of parmesan cheese (YUM), artichokes, roasted peppers, and olives.  But where the hell is the waiter?  Finally our waiter comes, who oddly resembles the kid from mad magazine. He was nice, took our order, and brought our food.  Overall slow service though.  The food was alright.  I had the lasagna and it was just a bit too rich for my liking.  I tried a bite of my friends alfredo and it was really good (but how do you mess up alfredo?)   It was alright.  I don't think i'd come back though."}
{"text":"As much as I want to love this place, I just can't. I've been here a handful of times & its always just okay. The food leaves something to be desired. Nothing really pops in flavor . Also- Service kind of sucks, staff isn't very warm or attentive. For the prices they need to make their dishes a lot yummier & act a lot more aiming to please."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Terra Verde; the first one being about 3 months ago. I ordered the chicken parm and was pleased with the quality of the food as well as the portion size.  However, I went back today for a company luncheon and when the waiter brought my order I was surprised that there was no pasta with my chicken parm. I mean afterall, what kind of italian restaurant doesn't serve pasta with cp? I questioned the waiter about it and his response was \"oh yea, we recently changed the menu and you no longer get pasta with that meal\". I definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"Took my Mom who was visiting for dinner.  Excellent service! Good calamari, great bread, and nice cheese and olive platter which is free! Great ceasar salad and tasty pizza. i thought they did a great job and I was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at terra verde on sunday feb 26 2012. It has been a year since we ate there due to the fact that the last time we were there we were charged $8 for a small plate of plain noodles for my 2 yr old.  We decided to give it another shot.  Now we will definitely NEVER go back. First of all we were charged $7 for sparkling water that is made from tap water in your back kitchen, fizzed up, served in a fancy glass bottle labeled STILL water. What a joke!  Second, my wife ordered soup that was cold, looked like vomit and tasted awful.  And last, I ordered veal Marsala that didn't taste that bad but I got 3 small pieces with some mushroom in a sauce for $15!  No sides or anything. I have never not received a side of pasta or vegetable at an Italian restaurant when ordering an entree. Now I understand why there were only 10 people in the restaurant. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Lunch in 15 minutes? Ha! I've had lunch there twice now, at two different visits, and the first time took over an hour and a half, the second over an hour. The food is mediocre for the price (although the bread with the dipping oil/balsamic is quite tasty), and the service leaves A LOT to be desired. It usually takes a looooong time to have your order taken, and if you want a drink refill (coffee and iced tea), you'd better start sucking on the ice cubes, because they will melt before you're going to get more.  I love the Green Valley Ranch resort, but am sorely disappointed in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I think this may be one of the most amazing places Ive ever been too. One big reason it was so amazing was we had a 50 dollar gift card from friends gambling in vegas,so thats awsome.When myself and my grandpa got in here we were sitted quickly wich was nice.Not many people were there,our waitress came over and asked what we wanted to drink.I only got a water my grandpa got a pepsi.A bread astored basket was braught over to us,about 3 diffrent kinds of bread and some green spread not sure what the hell it was.We got  butter for the bread.   I defently recomend comming here for lunch becuase, the prises raise for dinner.We got margarita pizza,chicken parm,and gnocchi with mozzarella cheese.The pizza came out first and its a thin pizza with slises of mozzarella and a little basil,the gnocchi had red sause basil and cheese,and chicken parm well you know whats on that.  Bread-most of them were chrispy and had a crunch crust,but one kind was softer and had garlic taste they were all good.  Pizza-thin crust but it wasnt burn wich is a big thing to me sence there easy to burn,the sause was sweet and tangy very nice,and the cheese was warm and yummy!  Chicken parm-No pasta came with this dish it was only two big pieces of chicken that had a nice crust,tamato sause,and cheese,the cheese was hella gooy so it was hard to take a piece with out the cheese getting every where,but thats how i like it!  GNOCCHI-Ok this is the first time ive actualy tryed potato gnocchi before,and it was to die for.From looking on diffrent menues in vegas most places sell this dish for about 20 dollars,I got it for nine,and it was a big plate full.They were fluffy and melt in your mouth oh just so good! GET THIS IF YOU COME HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I often meet a friend there at happy hour on Mondays for \"Meatball and Martini Monday.\" Half off all martinis and a generous appetizer of spaghetti and a huge meatball for $4. Not a bad deal in this economy."}
{"text":"Delish!  We went here last night for dinner and I have nothing to complain about.  The menu was extensive enough that there was an option for everyone and the wine menu looked like it was a mile long.  The antipasta included some of the traditional options as well as one thing I hadn't seen before - friend zucchini chips.  The appetizer of the day looked amazing, but I didn't have it (wanted to leave room for dinner).  My friend cleared the plate though!  I had the gnocchi which I worried sounded too simple, but it was a delicious simple! My husband had a pasta with sausage and cleared his plate (our waiter said it was the best pasta they made). And our friend had the bolognese, which he also cleared off his plate.    Our waiter was friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself was beautiful!  This is someplace I'd love to come back to next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Interior decor was very cozy, at the same time being very posh. We were greeted by the maitre d' and seated right away. The trio of treats they start you out with was a tabe favorite, the olives were so darn good! We started out with beef carpaccio. Hands down, best carpaccio I've ever had. I had the shrimp risotto, and the sommelier had suggested a bottle of Soffocone di Vincigliata, which has become one of my new favorite wines. Everyone who served us were on top of their game. I need to come back to try their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Beautiful & elegant ambiance. The waiters very professional, friendly & attentive.  We were offered complimentary zucchini chips, olives, Parmesan and variety of breads.   We started with fried calamari with spicy marinara. It was the best we ever had. Perfectly cooked. The marinara sauce had a hint of spice it complimented the calamari.   I had the Seaford Fra Diavolo with homemade fettuccini. It was delicious. My fiancé had the Veal Limone. He rates it 4 star dish. Nice tender Veal cooked to perfection. The spinach that came with it was kind of bland.   We ended with the desert sampler that included Limone tart, tiramisu, cannoli and peach custard. It was only $10 and worth it. I had hoped that the portion size of dessert was a big larger.   Our experience was memorable & will definitely return."}
{"text":"I finally went to this place after so long and I must say I could have waited some more time.  We sat down next to huge group enjoying New Years Day, which was fine, but I was looking for a romantic evening for two and I got noise and my gf decided that her phone was more interesting since we couldnt talk much.  :)  The antipasti that was complimentary served though was awesome as was the service.  Little bits of olives, roasted peppers, zuchinni chips, parmesan cheese hunk and marinated artichokes with really good bread.  I never had to ask for anything.  The main course though, papperdelle (did I spell that right?) bolognese was okay but very very bland, and my gf spaghetti carbonara was equally bland city.  Okay but not something I will seek out again.  I must say the desserts were one of the best Ive had in a long while, vanilla panna cotta, smooth and delicious, with a champagne gelee on top with berries and whip cream, the spumoni ice cream was equally delicious.  Altogether okay but not excellent.  Maybe next time we will just forgo the whole entree thing and eat the antipasti and dessert...sound great to me."}
{"text":"Restores my faith in the Italian-American concept restaurant.  I have been to a weekend evening dinner, Friday wine tasting and now Easter Brunch. Recommend all, particularly the brunch-VERY well done holiday event. (Hoping they assemble a standard Sunday Brunch that is even half as good.)"}
{"text":"Dinner After Our Massages / Spa Time  So we were already relaxed when we walked in around 6pm on a Wednesday evening. There were folks eating dinner but it wasn't super busy so we were seated quickly.  Dining Area: Open yet Quiet and Serene. They have a patio area that is nice to enjoy when the weather is good. Low lighting...  Light Colors .... Simple fixtures and furniture nothing overly ornate.  Wine: They have a good list of wines by the glass as well as a much longer list of bottles to be enjoyed. We opted to go \"by the glass\".  Plus, they offer 3oz pour options so that you can try several wines should you choose to be adventurous or indecisive.  I was a bit of both so I opted to go the 3oz route.  Mom had a glass of Pouilly Fuisse which she enjoyed very much.  I got a taste and must say that I would have ordered that too had I not opted to do a bit of sampling of a couple of 3oz pours.  Appetizers: They bring a small plate of green olives, parmesan cheese and crispy zucchini slices for you nibble on while you wait for your entrée. The parm cheese was fantastic!  It was fun to try the cheese with our wines because it brought out different flavors in our wines.  So good! The green olives were light, mild and slightly earthy. Not the typical oily or strong olive like black olives or kalamata olives or the ones they put in martinis. The crispy zucchini were gone in a matter of seconds.  I could just sip wine and eat those all day and be happy.    We ordered the Crostini also... it had prosciutto, provolone, arugula, grape tomatoes on it.  A very good item to start with because it's not big and it's not filling...  so you don't have to worry about being too full before dinner arrives.  Of course, we were hungry so that might have had something to do with it.  Food: Mom had the grilled fish/seafood special... it came with 3 different types of fish (swordfish, ahi and salmon), shrimp and lobster.  It wasn't big but it filled her up. The shellfish was a bit overcooked but the fish was perfectly cooked.... Not dry at all and Not fishy.  I had the crab ravioli special.  The raviolis were delicate and amazingly light.  It was served in a light white wine broth / sauce.  Side of broccoli... good enough for 2 people.... Perfectly seasoned and prepared. Not soggy... Not hard... \"Just right\".  Most of their dishes are on the \"light\" side... meaning no heavy sauces...  they really try to let the freshness of their dishes be the stars rather than trying to add flavor with lots of butter, cream or sauce.  Service: Welcoming...  Nice...  Polite...  Helpful... Lawrence was all of these. I wasn't sure what kind of vegetable side I wanted to go with my crab raviolis and he expertly pointed me in the right direction.  Price: Not super expensive but not cheap either... Figure about $50-70/pp depending on what you order.  Net, Net.... Definitely a great place to go for a lovely, quiet, excellent meal."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. It's ok. You don't pay for what you get and they charge you al la carte for everything. $30 for chicken parmesean, seriously?"}
{"text":"Fantastic mushroom truffle risotto!  My belly hurts lol.  Large restaurant with plenty of seating.  Honestly, the pizza blanca can be skipped but the risotto makes up for it as it is so damn yummy, I dreamt about it for days!"}
{"text":"Went here to eat for my dad's birthday and it was excellent! The waiter was very polite and very professional and the food was amazing. I had the pasta with sausage and peas (I don't remember the Italian name they had on the menu) but please try that dish. It was phenomenal."}
{"text":"A lovely and unexpected treat in the convention center, and the owner's charm and helpfulness made it that much better."}
{"text":"went here for wined up Friday.  The restaurant looked really nice at night and the wines were really good with generous pours.  This night however the appetizers that come with the 20 dollar deal were somewhat lacking.  They served provolone and Swiss cheese with five crackers and two black olives.  The cheese was not very fresh, so we did not finish or get more.  They also sent us some deviled eggs (good) and macaroni salad in a lettuce cup.... ???  Then we got a few bites of pizza that was cold.  Last year the same experience was way better.  I would prefer they not serve apps at all then these.  If you want bottomless wine however, this is the right place."}
{"text":"hmmm...  believe a lot has changed since my last visit to Terra Verde (new chef, open for lunch now), and im surprised to see the negative reviews on service because really that (along with a decently priced lunch) saved my review for this place...  lets revisit shall we?  it was a late Saturday afternoon in GVR, and (1) i didnt want to food court it (2) didnt want to pay $14 for a quesadilla through room service (3) didnt want to walk through The District and (4) everything at Tides seemed really rich for how i was feeling...  so, oila, Terra Verde it was...  greeted nicely by the hostess and took a seat at the bar...  place was a ghost town, maybe 2-3 other covers besides me...  the hostess let the waitress know i was sitting at the bar and i promptly ordered a pizza and a glass of Nipozzano Chianti...  runner presented me with a hearty bread basket, EVOO & balsamic...  food came out promptly and was tasty for what it was...  even though i was just a solo eater at the bar, i was given constant attention by the waitress and runner, my water glass was always full, and i had a nice, pleasing lunch of pizza and Chianti for around $25...  what more could i ask for?  ok, the pizza couldve been better (hence why only 3 stars), but the Nipozzano was priced right for a restaurant, i had great service, and overall enjoyed my lunch... A-OK to me!"}
{"text":"Extensive wine list and edible food but AWFUL bar staff. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Fancy Fancy Fancy! What a great group of people that work here.  Myself and 5 others showed up almost at closing and ordered A LOT of food and wine. They catered to us like kings. The food was great along with the wonderful wine.  Of course it was pricey but well worth it.  I recommend the white spinach pizza and the goat cheese salad!   We stayed until after closing without one complaint from the staff.  This is a great place to impress a hot date!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  The weather was perfect, so we sat outside.  I live on the Northwest side of town, so this was a rare visit to Green Valley Ranch.  Apparently, they just started serving lunch at Terra Verde.  The restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived at noon.  When we left at 1:30 pm, there were 10 tables occupied....I hope it works out as lunch was pretty good.  Food - The bread was good, not great.  There were 4 types of bread to choose from....I don't know what they were so I can't be more specific.  It was fresh and tasted good.  The server does the oil & vinegar for you.....which I don't like because they never get the correct proportions (-1) for that.....then they took the oil/vinegar with them so you couldn't add more when it was consumed...another (-1).  I had the Grilled Chicken Pesto Panini with thin sliced Zucchini Chips that comes with the dish.....it was good.  Again, I wasn't blown away with it.  The greens in the sandwich were a bit rubbery and the \"veggie\" taste overwhelmed the sandwich.  I thought it was an odd choice, especially with Pesto....which usually has a \"vegetable\" flavor to it already.  As a result, I couldn't really taste the chicken.  The panini bread was cooked just right...not too hard/soft.  Service - Our waitress was pretty entertaining and knowledgeable about the menu.  However, she was MIA at times and we waited for refills of water/iced tea.  She also rushed us a bit.....we were there for a business lunch and it felt rushed.  The place was empty, so I don't know what that was all about.....I'll chalk it up to inexperience.  She was young.  The combination of the good food & hit/miss service earned this place 3 Stars.  My business partners had the Toscana Pizza and they said it was very good....I should have went with the pizza.....it might have pushed it up to 4 stars.  Will I return?  Yes, if we have lunch in that area of town."}
{"text":"I thought Terra Rossa at Red Rock was really good, but this place is better, albeit a bit more expensive at least for me (Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock are \"sister\" properties). Terra Verde has a light airy atmosphere with lots of windows to the outside world. Except for problems making a reservation, the service was exquisite.   [START OF A KVETCH YOU CAN SKIP]. About the reservation: I'm staying at the hotel, and the number listed in the room for the restaurant didn't work. I had the operator connect me, but nobody answered - three tries over an hour. I think: \"Gee this place must be busy. We'll, I'll just have to take my chances.\" I get there and find a harried hostess juggling menus, but the place was all but empty. Oh well, what can you expect from a hotel in receivership. [END OF KVETCH].   But the food and service: ah! The waiter recommended an appetizer not on the menu --  figs on a bed of prosciutto, stuffed with cheese, topped with a balsamic reduction (see the picture). I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Next was a \"Tricolore salad of endives, radicchio, and arugula, with balsamic vinegar and parmigiana.\" I've never had such a fluffy salad before. It was perfect after the figs. Finally, my old favorite \"scaloppine al marsala\" served full of flavor and piping hot. A relaxing cappuccino with those cute rock sugar sticks topped off a perfect meal.   With a martini and the tip and tax it was over $90 just for me, but it was worth it. Now to see if I can get the hotel to comp it."}
{"text":"The space and service alone are worth 3 stars! Really, the restaurant is beautiful with tall french doors leading through the different spaces, and a large wrap-around patio shielded with lots of plants. Likewise, the service was impeccable. To start, the hostess replaced both our white napkins with black when she saw we were wearing black. Everyone was very friendly, orders were brought out promptly, and the food runner kept our dishes in the warmer for a couple minutes while my husband went to the bathroom. Honestly, it was more than I expected for a place inside GVR.   They have a short, but interesting cocktail menu. My husband got a gin drink with thyme in it, that tasted very spicy (like a spice...spice-y), but not too strong with alcohol flavor. I really enjoyed my 2 sips of it. Too bad their mocktail wasn't up to the same standard - just a pineapple orange strawberry juice, but oh well. You can't expect every place to make a great mocktail....  After we sat down, the waiter brought out bread & olive oil (good) and the chef's plate (olives, romano cheese, and zucchini chips - all ok). For our appetizer we ordered the night's special - mussels and clams in a tomato-wine sauce with toast. That was delicious. Even after the fish were all gone, we used the remaining bread to soak up the sauce, it was that good. The caesar salad we split was probably the most disappointing item of the night; it was fine, but the dressing was actually really bland. It had none of that anchovy tanginess that really makes a caesar (to me). For entrees, we had the shrimp risotto and the margherita pizza (but it was called something else). Both were good, and I loved the chewy crust of the flatbread pizza.  Overall, we had a really enjoyable meal at Terra Verde, and the atmosphere and service made it seem extra special & romantic. Be warned, though, it is a little pricier than your standard Italian restaurant - total for 2 entrees, salad, app, cocktail, and mocktail was about $100 with tip."}
{"text":"I had an early dinner here with my husband and another couple. I ordered the caprese salad and shrimp risotto. The caprese was good but fairly basic. The tomatoes seem to have been refrigerated and I prefer room temperature tomatoes as I feel they have more flavor. The risotto was also good, cooked properly with good flavor and an appropriate amount of cheese. The shrimp were grilled separately and then plated atop the risotto which was unexpected (by me, at least). I also ordered the strawberry mille feuille. I personally did not care for this dessert. It was described as puff pastry (which I expected to be soft and flaky). The strawberry coulis and cream were good but not nearly enough to make up for the very dry, crumbly pastry with which it was layered."}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams \"snooty pish posh\" ... the server was rude and unhelpful, the two valley \"ehmagerd, like whatever!\" girls who run the desk outside of the restaurant were rude and snotty as well and if you're not dressed in a suit and tie you should expect the same thing.... I hate how restaurants make you feel like you're an outcast if you don't dress up and spend a lot of money at a place...   my friend and i came here because the buffet was closing down and figured that they had okay prices on their pizza... after we ordered we were snubbed by the waitress because we didn't spend lavishly and generate enough income for the place so that she would expect a huge tip that she's probably use to...   come here if you like to be ridiculed for not having a lot of money to spend lavishly.  pizza was burnt on the bottom really badly and tasted of char and soot and I didn't want to complain because I already felt like we were out caste and not considered part of the cool kids club..."}
{"text":"We had the private dining room and our own waiter for my mom's birthday.  The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic.  There was plenty of space in the room for 7 of us, we could have had at least another 4 without feeling crammped. They even let us come early and decorate. Everybody was thrilled with their food when it came, our waiter really had the timing down! We couldnt' say something bad even if we wanted to! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was good, I wouldn't say great or to die for.  I think the lunch time is well worth it with plenty of the same dinner items for a much better price.  Probably won't return for dinner."}
{"text":"I went to Green Valley Ranch Station to see the UFC 116.  I had a late lunch at Terra Verde.  Rock doesn't work there. He \"moved\" on to his own gig.  I had the ceaser salad which was okay.  I couldn't find any anchovies in my dressing.  It's nice to have some meat instead of just paste.  My entree was the Veal Limone.  Sauted veal in a lemon caper sauce over a bed of spinich.  Garlic butter pasta with basil was perfect al dente'.   Had a glass of house Napa Cab.  Coffeee and Dessert was the special ricotta cheesecake.  It was much bigger than I expected. I only wanted a couple bites. This thing was the size of a hockey puck.  It was on a butter cookie on top of caramalized peaches. The top was dressed with a sweet cream with fresh berries.  All that for $58.  Reasonable price.  I was one of 4 tables, so service was excellent."}
{"text":"When in Nevada, this is a must-stop. The bolognese is da morire (Italian \"to die for\") and the lunch prices for all the delectable gourmet dishes makes this a hidden gem Italiano. ($9 for a generous portion). The ambience is wonderful, and the wine has never disappointed. Service great, too."}
{"text":"A great choice if you are looking to celebrate an anniversary or event but don't want to go all the way down to the Strip.  I love that you can park right in front of this restaurant, walk into the Green Valley Ranch and in a few feet enter this restaurant without having to walk through a lot of smoke to get there.   The ambiance is elegantly Italian with an excellent wine list, five star waiters and wonderful food.      It is not overly friendly, but I would say more reserved than snotty.  It is a beautiful place to have a wonderful meal"}
{"text":"erra Verde occupies the beautiful and largely unchanged space formerly known as the Il Fornio Ristorante.  Our server, Peter, brought us a bread basket and a wonderful relish tray with mixed olives, chunks of Reggiano Parmesan cheese, fried zucchini chips, roasted red and yellow peppers plus artichoke hearts.  Our appetizer was a beautiful Carpaccio - thinly sliced raw steak caressed gently by EVO, fried capers, arugula and shaved Reggiano Parmesan.  We each enjoyed a glass of the house Chianti that perfectly complimented our entrees.   Ms. Westie chose ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta in a tomato basil sauce.  I took our server's recommendation and chose agnotti (cheese ravioli) with a rich and delicious tomato meat sauce.  Both pastas dishes were house made and melted on our palates.   We closed out this feast by sharing a \"torta golosa\", a molten lava cake with vanilla gelato beautifully presented in the shape of a swan (until the piece forming the head and neck toppled over)."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! The wine is great, food is delicious and service is perfect! This is one of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. We always tend to take family when they come to visit and Terra Verde never disappoints, it's always a hit! We try to go here once a month and as often as possible! We also love the breads, olives, cheese, peppers and fried zucchini that you are able to enjoy while trying to decide what you want for your dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been to Terra Verde on Friday nights for their Wined Up event.  Every Friday they hold a \"Wined Up\" where it's $20 all you can drink wine and appetizers from 5 - 7 pm.  Some of the wines are really good and some are not that great, but it is fun to come with a group and not have to pay $7 - $10 a glass at another wine bar. They have many different types of wine too - usually a pinot, chardonnay and merlot... sometimes they'll throw in a moscato or other types.  Regardless, you can get pretty tipssaayyy in just 2 hours!!  The appetizers are mediocre, sometimes they're really good and sometimes they're not.    The restaurant is really nice, they also have outdoor seating with misters.  It is obviously better to sit outside in the spring and fall season.  The indoors is elegant, very nice italian restaurant.  They have a beautiful fireplace and very modern seating areas which are cute little spots for cocktail hour with friends.  I've never personally eaten at this restaurant, but a friend of mine did and said it wasn't as good as the price-tag makes it out to be.    Regardless, I think the Wined Up event is worth the money.  The best part about this event is the 1 price for everything, also they hold a raffle - you receive your ticket after you pay and get your wine glass and then at the end you usually win a bottle of wine or champagne.  I have never personally won anything, but the last few times I've gone somebody in our group has!  It's a sweet deal... Check it out with a couple of friends!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Terra Verde with some friends on a Thursday night.  We had an early reservation, so there were only a couple of tables seated.  As the night went on, the place picked up and several additional tables were seated.    We were approached immediately by a server and the sommelier.  We wanted a nice Barolo, and the sommelier had a great suggestion that was on the cheaper end of the wine list.  He hit the nail on the head, the wine drinkers at the table loved it.    They bring you olives, parmesan cheese, and some zucchini chips as a sort of amuse bouche for the table.  The special appetizer that evening was buffalo mozzarella topped with very crispy prosciutto served with candied walnuts and drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  We really enjoyed this, the cheese was soft and went well with the salty and crispy prosciutto.  The wife had the caprese salad.  It was a large serving and you could taste the basil throughout the dish.  It wasn't the best version of this dish I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.  We'd order it again.  To eat, I had the veal saltimbocca and the wife had the shrimp risotto.  The veal was 3 thin cutlets topped with prosciutto and a nice brown sauce.  It's served with herb and parmesan risotto.  The 2 components of this dish complemented each other well.  The veal was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it.  The sauce was herby and was great with the veal.  This was a delicious dish that I would order again.  The wife's shrimp was another winning dish.  This is large shrimp served with cheesy risotto.  The shrimp were tender and juicy, cooked very well.  This is a large dish, my wife didn't come close to finishing it even with my help.    We tried a puff pastry dish with strawberry sauce and cream for dessert.  This was the worst dish of the evening, the puff pastry was very dry and there wasn't nearly enough cream to combat the dryness.  I think this is a good dish in theory but the execution was off.  However, the dessert didn't affect the overall evening.  We loved our dinner at Terra Verde and received great service.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Man, if you haven't had a chance to try this place out on Fridays, what are you waiting for?!  Get down here ASAP.    So here's the scoop:  Every Fridays from 5pm-7pm, they offer a wine happy hour.  You pay $20 and you're treated to unlimited wine that also includes an array of amuse bouches (bite size appetizers).  This is such a great deal and a steal!!!  The seating area for this happy hour is outside in their concrete garden.  There's cute square tables and the walls are draped with vines.  Above is open wood awnings and misters for the heat.  Against the windowed doors, they have the wine table.  The bartender is super sweet and cute.  You have two whites and/or two reds to choose from.  Although it usually changes from week to week, I enjoy the chardonnay blend and the riesling.   The amuse bouches are great!!!  They change from week to week but my highlights were the following:  Salmon cerviche, ham and cheese mayo sandwiches, salmon mousse on radicchio and their cheese and cracker platter.  You're literally treated to a new plate every 15 minutes for the first hour and then you can ask for another helping of any plate for the second hour.  As many plates as you like.  The server is super sweet as well and really does a great job at making you feel comfortable.    This gem of Green Valley is a must visit!  You'll definitely spend a well worth it kind of happy hour!  Trust me when I say, this is my normal Friday night!  Such a steal!"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 of my girlfriends for dinner. We were staying at the GVR and had a $50 dining credit to use.  We were greeted by a very nice server named Eric. He explained the menu and and was very helpful.  Our table ordered 2 app's which were calamari and beef carpaccio ( which is my favorite) both were excellent.  As for dinner, everyone ordered something different from pizza to pasta to salmon. I opt for the grilled salmon which was perfectly cooked and to my liking. I tried a bite of the pizza and it was so light and crispy, not all that heavy dough and thick crust.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone especially guest of Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"Chef Rock, the winner of \"Hell's Kitchen\" Season 3, oversees the food served at this Green Valley Ranch restaurant, and, although he wasn't in the house the night my wife and I dined there (his executive chef Massimiliano Campanari apologized from the open-air kitchen that Rock was busy with media interviews and photo shoots), the dishes lived up to Gordon Ramsay's exacting standards.  While perusing the menu, we were served a tray of olives, marinated artichokes, roasted peppers, a hunk of parmesan, and zucchini chips, plus a bread basket. The service was better than most Vegas casino restaurants, with nearly more waitstaff than customers. More water? No need to ask.  I ordered the veal rouladen (involtini di vitello), three pounded veal steaks rolled up with prosciutto, fontina cheese, and sage, in a white wine sauce over spinach, and the pasta primavera: chopped veggies over trofiette, a house-made pasta that looks like thin white worms.   Despite the fact that the next table sent back their overcooked lamb chops (do these people think they're on TV?), I'll be back for more.  The tiramisu and zabaglione (sugary custard over berries) were decadent."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews, apparently I need to try this place again! I was definitely not overly impressed with my experience...  We went for the Sunday brunch. I was definitely impressed by the very varied menu. The food was good, but the service was AWFUL.   We sat for 15+ minutes before our waiter came to visit our table. This was in a half empty restaurant.. kind of ridiculous. Drinks took forever. I ordered some of the pesto flat bread to start... however the main course came and we still had yet to receive the flat bread. I had to remind the waiter to freaking bring it AFTER we were halfway done with the meal. The waiter was nothing but rude and aloof the entire meal. UGH.   Ravioli was good, tortello (sp?) was ok, steak and eggs was just ok (cut of meat didn't look too great, but I didn't personally try it). Flat bread was ok, but very goopy and coated in so much pesto you could choke. HOWEVER, prices were reasonable for the Vegas area ($9 for small portions of pasta, $7 for the \"flat bread\", $8 for drinks, etc).   Overall worth giving a try, but I was so disappointed by the bad service. It was a nice brunch option for a group where some were craving breakfast and some were craving lunch."}
{"text":"terra verde is beautiful inside I just wish the food was as good.  the complimentary noshes they offer are ok , the fried zucchini is oily.  the entrees are large in portion but nothin outstanding"}
{"text":"Came with family for buffet at GVR , but was crowded so this was our next choice. Not bad, it was not very busy and we got seated right away.  The antipasti tray was good for fried zucchini, roasted peppers, olives and a big piece of Parmesan cheese.    I had the soup, it was pasta e fagioli for $7 it had pasta, pavelta, canneoline and beans.  It was small portion but with good flavors.  For the entree I had the tortglione con salsiccia which was a spicy sausage with peas in a tomato cream sauce.  This was good, flavor able, not bad for $18.  Overall, the meal was good, the service was good, but it did seem a bit overpriced and stuffy."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in the Palais des Congres. The owner was a bit aggressive bringing us in, but in a friendly way. Mostly they serve pizzas and sandwiches with a selection of salads/sides, but they also had veggie quiche. The cafe is very clean and modern, and they employees are friendly and very helpful.  We tried the veggie quiche, pepperoni pizza, and cheese w/spinach pizza with the beet salad, veggie salad. The quiche is a big portion, tastes great, and had a really good texture. Was really happy they warmed it up in the oven so it was nice and warm all the way through. The pepperoni pizza was like a pizza bread moreso than an actual pizza, but it was yummy nonetheless. The spinach and cheese pizza was like a flat bread they warm up in the oven then fold over like a taco. Tasted pretty amazing :). The sides were equally good--especially the beet salad (but I might be biased lol).   Overall a great, convenient spot if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"I'm calling this Olive Heaven going forward.  They give you this amazing spread of olives, hard parm cheese blocks, and bread before your meal comes. Order a glass of wine and chill!    Great ambiance-they even have an indoor fireplace  Our meals were really good too!  See pix I posted.  And you can use your points here kiddies!"}
{"text":"Two words: Beef carpaccio. Seriously.  I often come here for the carpaccio and a great glass of wine and nothing else. But we'll come back to that.  Ambiance/atmosphere:   There are mini-spheres here that I love: small areas that separate themselves into various moods and levels of social interaction but still fit together in a comfortable, cohesive environment. This allows for larger parties and intimate dinners to be held at the same time without impinging upon the experience of others and it is, truly, one of the reasons I love this space.  Food and wine:  You can sit down and enjoy wine ordered from the bar or your waiter, or you can load a wine card and use the enomatics. Always a great selection, great information, and, I believe, they change things up just often enough. You can go back for a favorite, but you can always find something new.  Not sure what to go for? Ask the staff. I have had them take me on a mini-tasting tour in order to introduce me to new things, and I love that they love a challenge. I once had a waiter do a blind tasting for me when I questioned the lineage of a particular white blend that I said scared me. We tasted, tested, and his expertise made the meal and the experience a memorable one.  OK, the carpaccio. Top five of my life, if not higher. Shaved so thin you have to scrape it off the plate, perfectly marbled, and always melt-in-your mouth tender. Garnished with a healthy portion of arugula (think salad versus garnish) and complemented by sea salt, capers and an herbed oil... happiness on a plate.   In truth, I have never tasted anything bad here. The pastas are fresh and flavorful, the sauces are well cared for and perfectly executed, and the desserts will convert any dieter. One great test for this Italian/Greek girl? Something simple: spaghetti and meatballs. Truly something my Nana would have been proud of.   The recommendations for wine are not their only strength. Give the staff an idea of what you're in the mood to eat and they'll help you there, too. The descriptions and flavor profiles are as they are portrayed on the menu and everything is fresh, clean, and well-prepared.  Staff:  The servers are always accomodating, friendly and, more important, knowledgeable about the menu and food in general. I have never had to flag someone down, ask for refills, or question the timing of our order. Even when someone is not working your table, they are easy with the smiles, the offer to help get something for you, or just to ask you how your meal is going.  Definitely a favorite, repeat dining spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Green Valley for lunch!  The food is of the highest quality and has reasonable prices."}
{"text":"They worked extra hard to ignore us............... Came in with my clients who were putting me up at the Green Valley Ranch. Nice complex, nice room. Husband of the client pair had to leave within hour to catch shuttle to airport. Walked in on a Wednesday at 6:00. Asked by hostess did we have rez, answered no and did it matter? She replies yes, the only thing we have available, blah blah blah.....SO we end up sitting at high top table in bar area. Hostess seats us, gives no menus. TEN minutes we sit there while being passed at least 20 times by various staff including the manager. Client finally gets up and speaks with manager who tells us bartender will wait on us. Same bartender who has been behind bar this whole time facing us, with no customers, but who did appear to be busy getting bar prepped. Bartender comes over a few minutes later, gets us set up and does get our wine and food out to us fairly fast. Food was better than I expected, had risotto, very creamy and tasty. The prices though? A little steep, IMHO. And of course, after making us sit in the bar area as we didn't have reservations, we observed the restaurant was 60% empty throughout our time there. Go elsewhere, hopefully somewhere with less indifferent staff!"}
{"text":"So, I've been to terra verde multiple times, and before yesterday, I enjoyed it. Me and two friends arrived there at 9 pm, having suggested this restaurant. The hostess greeted us warmly , and told us to wait at their brand new lounge. They had remodeled the week before, and the architecture was beautifully redone.   We waited in the lounge for around 5 minutes, which is decent because we were walk ins. Finally, we were seated. They served us \"complimentary\" hor d'ouvres, which included delicious zucchini chips, olives, parmasan cheese, bell peppers, and artichokes. We also received some bread.  For appetizers, we had the calamari. The service started sucking at this point, where we saw the calamari finished, just sitting on the kitchen station. It sat there forever, and we were hungry ... so we asked the busboy to grab it for us. Besides the fact that the calamari was slightly cold, it tasted ok and we hoped for a better entree.  But, that was not the case. We waited for our entree for a while, with no one in sight. Finally, the server brought the food after a long silence had fallen upon the table. I had the osso bucco with saffron risotto, and it was terrible. The risotto was undercooked, and the osso bucco was a bit cold and dry. The artistic presentation was disgusting, it was meat on top on yellow risotto. No garnish, no design whatsoever, just meat on top of rice. How much worse can it get? One of my friends had the chicken with italian brocolli. He told me that the chicken was dry and cold. Again, the presentation was so unoriginal. Chicken on top of brocolli with sauce on the side, a whole grain mustard creme sauce. Yuck. The best entree by far that we had was the pizza, and it was just a sausage pizza. It is the easiet thing to make, and if they screwed that up.... the pizza was decent, but it was cold as well, nothing special.  Overall, I definately would not go back. The service was terrible, maybe a 1 star, for he brought out our food late or did not bring it out at all and he pretty much ignored us most of the time. The food went from good to bad, the samplers excellent, the rest, not so. The food was close to mediocre, and it was not worth it going there. Before, I would of given this place a 4 star, but now.... Don't go unless you want to admire the new architecture."}
{"text":"I am glad to finally have tried Terra Verde out. It is a very elegant dining place stacked with wine upon wine upon wine!!! It is dimly lit and has lounge sitting placed around a fire... all for making a comforting and intimate setting.   My friend and I enjoyed the bread basket with a variety of bread (my favorite was the soft one baked with pesto!) and the Parmesan, olive, and artichoke heart platter that is provided.   For an appetizer we split a vinaigrette salad, good flavor and balance.. and I liked how they change it up with the heirloom tomatoes... but possibly a bit too acidic for my mouth because it started to hurt afterwords.. I cant imagine eating the entire salad!   The entree: I went with something \"light\" so I could avoid the pain from my GERD later on;]... the linguine with clams. I was very, very satisfied with this dish because the pasta is cooked to al dente perfection and it is definitely a hefty portion. The noodles are not drenched in a heavy sauce and it was the perfect balance. When I was \"finished,\" it still looked untouched. My friend stuck with a simple meat sauce pasta, I tried it and it was good, but something I wouldn't get.   Aside from the fact that we were \"stuffed\" (possibly from our bread basket), we got dessert anyways. Chocolate decadence was what it was called and it was exactly that. When the dessert first came out my thoughts were: \"you are really serving us this dinky piece of nothing?!\" But oh how I was wrong. Yes, small... but extremely rich.. and chocolaty.. and smooth.. and yummy. It had everything a dessert should have, a little crunch from the chocolate shell, the smooth, mousse like texture, bitterness from the cocoa, fruity syrup to complement the heavy chocolate, and of course.. CHOCOLATE.   So, I wrote a bit much longer on the little dessert that probably requires no effort.. oh well. And while you are reading this you are wondering why 3 stars?? Because the service was lacking.... a lot. We were left alone. Our waiter didn't ask for drinks for about 20 minutes, then after that, we waited another 20 for our appetizer.. then entree.. But along with dessert came our bill.. almost forcing us to leave?? The only reason we were staying there for so long was because you kept us there!! The bus boys were on it the entire night, but the waiter... where were you??? Yes it was Saturday, but not all too crowded.. Will I give it another chance?? Maybe, but not willingly."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant!!!!!!!  From the very beginning it was awful- the sommelier was a pompous ass, the waitress was fresh off the Red Robin and had no clue about fine dining, and when I finally lost my shit and spoke with a manager, she was semi-apologetic.  They are lucky that the food is good- but I still will never return!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our night out here!  Dinner was very good; no complaints amongst our party of 4.  Service was very good!  My absolute favorite part of the meal was the pistachio ice cream!!  Omg!!! So delicious!!  They had a very nice selection of wine!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  The staff is super and food is excellent.  Love the black truffle risotto and osso bucco."}
