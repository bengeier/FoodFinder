{"text":"So I'm super sad to say I won't be back to this place... I started coming here recently with my boyfriend to gamble a bit and have lunch after work, so we decided to grab some food here on our day off which ended up being a bad idea. Our server wasn't exactly friendly nor was she good at  acting like she cared, I ordered breakfast with a side of biscuits and gravy my boyfriend ordered a burger we received the burger and breakfast first then the server disappeared. I thought maybe she just forgot about my biscuits and gravy which wasn't too big of a deal because it wouldn't  be the end of the world if I didn't get it so I just ate the food I had. by the time we were done with our food our server never stopped by to check on us the only person who did was a busser who was refilling our drinks he was very friendly. So after we both finished eating another gentleman came to our table with the biscuits and gravy he seemed a little confused and asked you had the biscuits and gravy and I replied yes but I really don't want it any more cuz I'm finished he responded by saying ok so you don't want it and I was like no I'm sorry and so he took it back to the kitchen where I could here him loudly telling everyone in the kitchen that I said too bad I don't want it. He pretty much lied about our conversation I was not rude at all if anything he was and then he goes in the kitchen and tells lies about how I turned down my order and told him it was too bad! Omg I felt so uncomfortable!!! So by this time we were just ready to leave but our server was no where to be found a good 15 minutes went by and nothing so we asked the busser if we could get the check and so he went to get the server who Of course drops off the check doesn't say a word and walks away, we opened up the check and there was the damn biscuits and gravy still on our bill like seriously I'm not gonna pay for something that didn't even make it to our table I didn't even touch the damn plate! So we waited and she never came back so we went up to the cashier and we told her we never got the biscuits and gravy and without argument or any apology or not even a question she just said ok I'll take it off it was almost like she already knew and didn't want to deal with it... but hey I'm not arguing as long as I didn't have to pay for that shit I'm good, just a heads up the service here is terrible the staff is rude and there's no sign of management"}
{"text":"This place is my JAM.  I moved to Las Vegas in January of 2006, fresh from college and I only knew one person in the entire town, my roommate.  After we unloaded the Uhaul we were famished so she took me to this little joint just up the road called Barley's.  I still remember the exact booth I sat in, the pizza I ate and the deliciously refreshing Hefe I drank.  I wasn't much into beer at that point, but from the first sip I knew I was in love.  I can pretty much guarantee I came to Barley's Every.Single.Night I lived in Green Valley.  Even proud to say I made it to the 3am-6am happy hour on many occasions.  When I eventually moved to the other side of the strip I still popped by as much as I could.    My husband and I moved back to California in 2009, and my Vegas friends that would drive up to visit would bring me my favorite Barley's sandwich (no longer on the menu).  Whenever i'm in Vegas, you can guarantee no matter what i'm doing or who i'm with, I WILL go to Barleys.  One of the bartenders is still there and I love that.  Now that i'm a total responsible adult with a kid, I usually end up sitting in the restaurant section, but whenever I have the opportunity, I'm sitting up in the bar just like in the good old days.  Hey, the dining service has always been slow, owners have changed and the menu varies, but the employees are wonderful and the beer is always amazing."}
{"text":"I love supporting local restaurants especially local breweries, but I won't be back here, at least not for the food. My wife and our three kids came here on July 4th with a Groupon thinking we'd get a decent meal before heading to watch fireworks. Everyone of our dishes was overcooked. Prime rib, overdone. Philly cheesesteak, dry and burnt. Chicken park, dry and burnt. Grilled cheese! How do you mess up grilled cheese?! They found a way. I told the management and they comped our meal, which was fine, but I would have rather paid and got a good meal then got a crappy dinner for free. I still have my groupon, but more then likely will not be using it. It's a shame, this was a great local spot before bought out by Station Casinos, now it's just another place to cater to the casino players. Save your money on the food, spend it on the beer."}
{"text":"This is an update to my review. This one is updated to mention the breakfast which is the only meal you should eat here.   Most of the servers and hosts are great people, but I've heard from others that there is one who may be poaching customers to pad her tips.   As for the food,  the cooks keep their grill so hot, the eggs are always overcooked. But once you go through the ordeal of sending it back it usually comes back as ordered. But this should not happen most visits.   Again, breakfast should be the only meal you eat here as the lunch and dinner menu items are pretty poor quality.  Even though the eggs are always over cooked, everything else is not bad for breakfast.  1.99/2.99 breakfast special is a great deal. Menu items are a bit on the expensive side for the quality. Stick with the special."}
{"text":"We love this place because the staff is always nice and the food is pretty good.  The wait time can some time be a bit long, however if you don't mind waiting the food is rewarding.  They offer a buffet both t breakfast and lunch time. However. I wasn't very impressed with it.  The menu has slit of choices, both healthy or greasy bad.  I think my favorite is the turkey club sandwich, but their Cesar salad was also delicious."}
{"text":"Barley's is a lot of fun, especially if you eat int he bar and lounge area. This is a great place to watch sports.  The beers they brew on site, especially the Black Mountain Unfiltered are really good. The food is all pretty good and I've always enjoyed the service no matter what time of day I go in."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in years.. Back then it was pretty good...setting and layout was decent.staff was decent...when in the other day & just about everything changed & not for the better...it just seemed dirty and unfriendly...i had to wait forever for 1 drink even though they were not busy.  I don't know i probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I was told last night feb. 14 that I could not use my coupon for buy one entry get one free because it was a holiday! Since when do we recognize feb. 14 a holiday??? VERY DISAPOINTED I think you need to educate your help."}
{"text":"I give a 3 star not for the beers...the beers are 5 stars, love the red rock it's bomb.  The service is pretty brutal at times so don't be in a hurry at this place. Food is decent, happy hour beers are unbeatable, they have the best deals I have seen. They also have outdoor seating which seems sweet....but it's never open! I don't get that.  Add some extra staff and the beers will sell themselves at this place."}
{"text":"Great local bar and casino. Food is top notch for bar food (get the wings).  You can see the sports book from every seat."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place today.  It's not the place to go if you're hungry and want a beer. YEP..DON'T GO TO A BAR AND RESTURANT FOR THAT.  There was waitresses everywhere doing all sorts of things but only 1 looked like they were working.  It took half an hour to get a beer.  We waited another half hour for wings but figured they weren't coming out anytime soon so hunted down our bill and left. Lucky for us there's lots of other choices in the neighborhood were our business is appreciated."}
{"text":"I love this place they have great beer and lots of Tv's and great food which makes the perfect football Sunday with my lady and friends the guys and girls at the betting windows are the best they gave us free drink tickets just for making a few bets and they're always super nice however the reason for the 4 stars is because of all the smokers in the place so if you are smoke sensitive this is not the place for you"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Went for lunch today.  I sat there in a booth for 20 minutes before the waitress finally arrived to take my order.  After being there now for 35 minutes I got the meatloaf dinner that I ordered.  I took one bite and discovered that the two pieces had been 'grilled' and the bottom sides were totally burnt.  I pointed it out to the busboy, as the waitress was again hiding in the kitchen, I then left.  My lunchtime was just about over and no food.  I've tried that place three times now and each has been worse than the last.  I will never return."}
{"text":"If you like the smell of rotting hops and bumping into cleaning personnel constantly then this is your place. The bathroom at Barleys reeks so bad because of a sewage issue they will never fix because Stations uses this place and Wildfire locations as chess pieces to control the Henderson market .If and when you can get into the bathroom here  due to overacting to stay busy army of janitors it smells like rotting hops  due to the fact that their stinky brew excess runs a river of muck under the bar into streets of Henderson. A stench so bad  It will make a mule puke .How anyone can drink the swill after smelling it rot underneath you is beyond me. But the sheeple sit up there and chug away at the steaming horse piss they call beer, yukkkkkk!  Advise use some of the millions you rake off locals fix the pipes and get a new brewmaster...."}
{"text":"I don't think Barley's gets enough credit!  It's a good place to go for a burger and a beer (make sure you get the player's card, playa).  The brews are good, my favorite is the Red Rock... for you people familiar with San Diego, it's similar to an Amber Karl Straus.  The chairs are comfy in the sportsbook area but I'm partial to the bar, especially when the Laker game is on.    I won 3 dollars when I first came here! That's three more than I played! (I'm not a gambling woman).   Simply.... get a burger or a pizza and you'll be okay."}
{"text":"Arogant staff. Tried to fill a growler and was talked down to because I had a bottle from a different brewery. They wouldn't fill it even though you can get a growler filled with their beer at Total Wine.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The food is only decent. The only reason I could ever see coming back here would be for the beer, and quite frankly, I'd rather drive across town to the Tenaya Creek Brewery. I can say I won't be a return customer"}
{"text":"Bottoms up! Another beer buffet! So many choices of beer you can drink. There was a mix between a DJ and Live performances and the food had great portions for a great price!  $5 bucks for an entree and chips? I'm jelly! My favorite was the Jalapeno beer!  It sounds weird but is just pure awesomeness!  Pros: Plenty of beer and cheap food!  Cons: Dont drive if you're drinking!"}
{"text":"I believe the restaurant is under new management and the food is much better than I remember six months or so back. The prices increased but so did the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Stepping through the door is like going back in time and not in a good way! Waited nearly 10 min to be acknowledged by a server then when prompted she only knew one of the multiple specials on at the time. Also as a brewery I'd highly suggest training your staff on styles of beer. Dark is not an adequate description and all beers are not lagers. I'm sure the food menu hasn't changed since the doors first opened so we didn't have the guts to order what surely would be frozen food microwaved to half life."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place gets a 2 and not 1 is the hefe they make is great! Every time to go here (while waiting on a movie next door) my atm card doesnt work. Says my limit is exceeded????!!! There is no way this is possible. And OK that may not be a service issue, but its how they treat me when it happens. I can pay at bar just fine. The machines, and cashier cage dont take it, and give me a \"youre a loser\" attitude all 3 times its happened. And..... 3 men as well as myself were sitting watching something at the sports book and a manager (29-35, stocky, bearded white guy) walks over and yells at guy behind sports book to turn that off its annoying him. The guy behind the counter looks at us like \"sorry\" and turns it off. Customer service fail! The only positive from last few visits was the nice 40 something bar tender with black hair working the night of the 29th around 10pm."}
{"text":"Service was as great as the food! However the hostess, Kayla, was rather sassy. Maybe she was having a bad day? Otherwise great experience!!   ----------------------------  came back on June 16 and the menu has changed! Way fewer options and no more sweet potato fries. Doubt I will be back. Service was average this time around ):"}
{"text":"Yeah. They got rid of the $4.99 AYCE Salad Bar. Oh yes, it's still there, but now it's $7.99. No more discounts. And if I'm going to pay full price for a salad bar, I need a little more variety. It was fine at $5, not so much at $8.  Considering that it was the primary redeeming factor about the place, that's a massive FAIL."}
{"text":"First time here... Great food and cheap price... Great bartender was awesome  Thank you Tina for the great service"}
{"text":"Super friendly server, Tracy and probably the best prices we've seen in the Vegas area.  If you're from out of town, this is a nice \"upscale, dive bar\" with slots and a sports book.  Great place to watch sports and good deals during NFL games.  If you like nachos, you have to try these.  They are in my top 5 nachos even though they use cheese whiz.  It works with they way they layer the toppings.  You get lots of everything in each layer.  Also, highly recommend the Spicy wings. I think they were the spicy garlic - just the right heat but with loads of flavor. Try the home brews also.  Really nice microbrew/dive place to hang out.  Only downside is the \"smoking everywhere in Vegas\" scene"}
{"text":"Their food is nothing to write home about, but they brew a decent beer. I especially liked the Citraweisen and the Honey Blonde."}
{"text":"Smokey!  Took forever to get seated... then to order a drink or get water... then to order food... then to get hot sauce... then to get the check.  Noelle saw us there as she helped other tables so I figured that she wasn't our server.  Thankfully we weren't in a rush.   Twenty minutes later, a guy comes to us, lots of facial hair & young, wish I saw his name tag.  I ask him for hot sauce cause I saw the other table had Cholula, he brings me Tabasco & seemed like he just wasn't interested in his job, neither did Noelle.  She was actually our server & after walking by numerous times told us she'd be back for our order, even though we were ready twenty minute ago.  Instead of taking our order she says, the table over there was waiting before us.  Ok.  I ordered the carne asada tacos & my friend ordered the beef soup... it was that or Pea Soup lol she says to me we only have steak & chicken tacos... I said ok steak please.  (Carne asade) The girl who brought our food had the hiccups lol some pieces of the steak were chewy so definitely needed to floss afterwards.  Tacos were the best part of the experience, also that they are part of the Stations Casinos so I got some points.  Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Tried the avocado bites today. Something new for this month. Absolutely no regrets for that. Good flavor and texture. It was not mushy."}
{"text":"Hate to give this place 2 stars. In actuality, the service here definitely deserves 5. But unfortunately, the food here was not up to par with the great service that I had received.  This cafe is inside of the Barleys casino, a legendary ol school mini casino which brews its own beers. It's a very simple place and its serves a fairly basic menu. The waitress that took my order was great, she was helpful and friendly.  The first thing I ordered were the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were either undercooked or just the frozen ready-to-eat ones, but they were sorta slimy and not sweet at all. The cocktail sauce was gross, it tasted basically like bottled ketchup.  The next thing that came up were the chili fries. It was canned chili beans on not-so-crispy shoestring fries. I had about 3 bites, and I was done. One of the hardest things I've ever had to eat.  The Reuben was next. Ok, so it wasn't that bad. I thought that the rye bread could have been crispier, but the flavor was pretty good. The corned beef tasted like it was premade, and so did the dressing. I was thankful that they had at least rinsed the sauerkraut, because it wasn't too sour. The coleslaw didn't taste like anything at all, probably came from a jar.  The food tasted like it was all made a while ago, and probably came from a can. I prefer things that are made fresh. But the food is nostalgic in a way. And it reminds us how far we have gotten since then. Too bad that the food couldn't hold a candle to the amazing front of the house staff that works there. But as I always say \"Que sera, sera\"."}
{"text":"I've never been here before so I thought I would stop in for a quick bite.  I was greeted warmly and taken to a clean booth.  Athena came out all smiles and happy.  She went over the menu with me and helped me decide on the barley soup and a Cobb salad.  Delicious!  Everything came out super fast.  Athena has a great personality and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great beer and the best service in Henderson!! Had terrible service 1 time. That was the only time I  saw that server, so management is obviously paying attention. ALL the rest of the servers are great!!! And HAPPY HOUR is truly HAPPY!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Besides all the slots....It's also a brewery. Try the Blue Diamond! The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We used to love going to Barley's for breakfast. When they changed their menu last year, the food just wasn't the same. The service is great, they people working there are awesome, but we won't be going back there to eat any time soon. Yes it is inexpressive but it the food is bland and the items on the menu are lacking. They used to have the most amazing banana bread French toast but they did away with it and it is extremely sad."}
{"text":"Saturday night BBQ was a real treat. This was our 1st time to visit this place and we will definitly return."}
{"text":"I had not eaten pizza here for several years. they USED TO MAKE GOOD pizza here and sell it by the slice.  They stopped selling it by the slice. now it is  7\" or 16\". I ORDERED THIN CRUST.  what I got was a thick crust that was not not completely  cooked. the sauce  not not very good. Needless to say I will not be going back. I give it a ONE STAR."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE! Took 10 mins to order drinks and an hour to get our food. The waiters are slow and business is under staffed."}
{"text":"Best chicken noodle soap ever!! Thick noodles with a tasty broth! The salad bar is yummy too! Lots of options plus all you can eat pepperoni & cheese pizza. They have there own wood fire oven. The service is great too.  The only down side is walking the smokey casino to get to the cafe."}
{"text":"This place has got to be the most frustrating place ever.  Yes, the \"service\" if you can call it that and get some is beyond horrid.  The regular menu is so bad, but they at least always had crispy bacon for their cheap breakfast special and I could always get my football game on the big screen.   That's all I got!   This place is always a \"I wish they would get it together\" but they just never do.  I have met some of the world's worst workers in this place.   We still reference a certain waitress by name to refer to horrible service.  Been overcharged and they didn't know how to refund so just gave a credit, etc.    But somehow we still go back.  Hope is a curse."}
{"text":"My two stars are based solely on the service, we as in a group of people usually come here for football because the game is on a huge screen TV and their specials are really cheap and good. They have great pizza but if you want something from your waitress make sure you tell her the first time you see her because it will probably be the last time you see her. If you want a little more attention you could sit at the bar and have the bartenders there ignore you after they ask if you want a refill and walk away... The last two times we have come here have been the same crappy bitchy services... If you want decent service ask for gina as a bartender she's the only one who seems to know what she's doing."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good beers for being located inside a casino. Tried 10 beers, all classically styled. We weren't expecting much but enjoyed the pumpkin and stout the most- their spiced ale was also tasty. Would recommend stopping by. Didn't try the food but they had some killer deals on bar food- burgers etc."}
{"text":"Worst. Barbecue. Ever.  We have been told by employees how great this Saturday night \"all you can eat\" barbecue is for at least a year or so.  So we decided to finally try it and made a huge mistake.  We got there early, and waited while they brought the food to the steamtables - it must have been cold, since they were just carrying the metal pans and setting them in to warm up.  Then, when we finally got to eat - well, everything (except the chicken, which was swimming in sauce) was dry.  Dry ribs, dry brisket.  The brisket was also fatty and tasteless.  No real flavor to any of the meat.  Pulled pork was flavorless.  I guess they cook the meat, and then since they have a pan of barbecue sauce at the end, you're supposed to add all the sauce yourself.  How is that barbecue? It was way overpriced for the quality of the meal.  The only good thing was the coleslaw and cobbler, and that's not worth $13 a person."}
{"text":"I love their brewing beers. And their happy hour. We found this place when we lived next door. Now we live far and we take any opporyunity to stop by. And you can still usr your station casino. My favorite bartender is Justine and the blond lady at nigth always with greeting customer service."}
{"text":"I've been in Las Vegas/Henderson for 36 years so I remember Barley's of years past. Used to be a nice, cozy place where you could get a bite to eat, and gamble. A locals place where everyone knew you. The fountains outside were a nice place for the kids to play in the summer.   Unfortunately like everything else Barley's has changed, and not for the better. In this review I'll deal with my interactions with this business over the last 8 months.   After not going into Barley's for a few years I went in about 8 months ago. The employees were very friendly, I got everyone's business card, was told to call them if I needed ANYTHING, that they would leave the casino to get me what I needed (BS, they love this line, but it's BS). I really didn't need anything, I'm sort of a non needy type player. I like to be left alone, get a diet coke every now and then and if I win a hand pay I like it paid promptly. That's not really a problem here, since the machines rarely if ever hit. If they do no one is automatically called, you need to flag down an employee. Sort of low class. And there aren't many employees here. You have your Manager on Duty, the pay out girl, a cocktail waitress (sometimes), someone in the change booth, security guy walking around and a janitor. That's it. The only time I did need anything, was at the end of the day of being there. I needed some change. There was no one around. I didn't want to leave my machine. Security walked by and I asked him about it and he told me to go to the change booth. Great. BUT REMEMBER! ''They'll get you ANYTHING here! If you need ANYTHING just let them know! blah blah blah blah blahhhhhhhhhh.'' I asked two other people walking by and was told to go to the change booth. So I left.   Took me 8 more months to come back in, I thought it might be better this time. It wasn't. When I walked in I got a very tired non-authentic ''If you need something let me know.'' from a male employee who looked half asleep.  The machines were still horrible, you still had to flag someone down for any assistance. Again I was told repeatedly that if I needed anything to just ask. I wanted a cup of coffee. They brought me THE oldest cup of coffee known to man. I almost gagged when I tasted it. I complained and the woman who brought it to me said loudly ''Well I don't drink coffee how was I to know?'' Your nose doesn't work? The cocktail waitresses are either around every 5 minutes, or gone for hours. On this morning all the employees were very busy mopping the floor. Everyone was very concerned about this floor. They had everyone with mops and rags. Never mind the customers WE HAVE A DIRTY FLOOR!   On this occasion I asked for a ham sandwich from the coffee shop. They have no ham. I said that was fine I didn't want anything. So the girl comes up to me 20 minutes later and tells me the security guard will run to Smith's to buy me ham. Really? Then just go do it. 20 minutes ago. Don't come up and ask me first. You may as well have said ''It's a huge inconvenience and that's why I'm asking first so do you still want it???'' Forget it. They acted like I ordered a Baked Alaska or something. It's a HAM sandwich!   Against my better judgment I ended up there a third time, about a week later. Same horrible machines gobbling up your money like it was tic-tacs, same ''If you need ANYTHING just ask!'' Same cocktail waitress up my butt every five minutes.... until I wanted something. I thought I would get something to go and look at a menu so I turned my light on my machine on. No one came, nothing happened, zilch. Twenty minutes later, as I was getting ready to leave the girl asked what I wanted and I said ''What are you talking about?'' I had even forgot I had put my light on. Again, there are NO employees at this business and the ones there are lazy. She said she was on break and had asked the security guard to watch out for me and call her if my light went on. He didn't. He was too busy hacking up his lungs and touching everything in the place. He coughed and coughed and coughed, rarely bothering to cover his mouth. And then went around touching things in the casino. I don't know if he was sick, or it was a smoker's cough but it was nasty and this employee had no business being at work. They don't need a security guard anyhow. They do nothing. They walk back and forth through the casino. Even when asked to do something, as in this example, they can't handle it. So I got to drive thru Wendy's for lunch.   They don't care about customers. Customers are treated like shit. They pay a good lip service, but when you hold their feet to the fire you're the one who gets burned. Barley's is a sad example of a ''Stations Casino'' and needs a major overhaul. Learn how to treat your customers correctly. I know I won't go back there. But I have a feeling I'll be driving by before too long and see it completely out of business."}
{"text":"Horrible rude service. Ordered an omlete waited an hour it never came. My girlfriends food came but no omlete. Told them to cancel my order and was rudely given a bill with no apology or explenation. Highly do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Have patronized this place for years and always brought family here when they come to visit, but something has been going on here since they changed the menu a few months ago and it ain't good.   Just finished the brisket and I swear i almost ran to the bathroom.  Brisket was 50% fat and was smothered in bbq sauce probably to hide the fat      Mashed potato had a dried skin probably from sitting under the heat lamp.  I'm grossed out to be honest. Time to find another place to take family next time.   Word to the Chef, management or Fertittas. It's not that hard to put out decent diner food. Have a little Pride!"}
{"text":"We were seated by the hostess immediately.  We ordered our food, they do have a good selection on the menu, but too much....we got our food as we ordered it, after a short wait. The food was tasty and the coffee was good.  We both had three pieces of bacon, three eggs, hashbrowns, and toast for $6.99."}
{"text":"Unprofessional and disrespectful to their customers. Had an issue at this establishment. Was given GMs phone number to resolve it. GM refuses to even call me back."}
{"text":"It's quite unlike me to go into casinos, but I got a flat tire and was parked outside of here waiting for a friend. I was craving a burger and was hoping that since they are owned by the Wildfire people that maybe the burgers would be good here too. Of course I've only heard that Wildfire had good burgers so I may have been going on bad info for all I know. Anyhow, so I go in here and make my way to the back cafe.  Good... Friendly service! I have to actually give the server props. I was in a FOUL mood and not being very friendly. Not outright mean or anything, but I was super stressed. She was so nice and even hurried my food since she could tell that I was waiting to get somewhere. I tipped 30% to try to thank her for that!  Cheap...Seriously, a burger and fries for $6. That's pretty cheap especially since you aren't at a fast food place. Definitely worth going back to try other things and see if I just ordered the wrong thing.  Smoke free....or at least I didn't smell any smoke and I am SENSITIVE. Usually you go in casinos and they reek of cigarettes, but this place didn't seem to have  a problem. I don't even remember seeing anyone smoke but I'm sure they do. Ick.  Bad... Bad seating for singles...I really hate sitting at a table by myself. That's why I usually go to bars. There is a bar in the cafe but there are no chairs around it and it isn't stocked. The servers go to the casino bar to get drinks. I'm sure they just didn't have a call for it, but it still sucks. Here I was sitting in a big booth that could have fit four plus purses.   Mediocre food...The burger was just ok. Pretty sure the meat was from frozen and the fries were DEFINITELY frozen. I guess I'm spoiled from being in Denver where the restaurants practically compete to have the \"Most Awesome Anything.\" The corporate mindset of Las Vegas definitely leaves something to be desired.  Lots of old people...this place seems like it must be the local eatery for all the old people in the area. Everyone seem pretty dated. It makes someone like me who is only in their 30's think that I don't really want to go back again.   All in all this place was ok and I may try it again one day. I have hope that there might be some better things on their menu if they are taking time to brew beer. If I hadn't been in such a crap mood I probably would have had beer but I wanted bourbon. Of course in this area the best you ever get is Maker's. Oh to see a bottle of Blanton's on a shelf would be like heaven."}
{"text":"We tried this little cafe out since hubby was placing a bet and it's been one of our neighborhood favorites or a place to grab a quick bite before a movie next door. The food is always good and the price for it is cheap! The steak is tender and salmon always cooked nicely. I love that they have a soup and salad bar as well. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular patron but no more. The staff is always pleasant and do a great job. Since the menu has changed removing most of my family's favorite dishes and a drastic increase in prices not worth being there. Six dollars for a mediocre salad bar add on with a meal is outrageous. Reminds when the place opened and they tried having the cafe as fine dining, it didn't work. Return to good food at reasonable prices and I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm always at Smith's Grocery store in the same plaza and am always curious about this place, so when my parents were in town visiting, I suggested we check it out because it just looks HUGE from the parking lot and plaza.  Umm not the case. It's a really small casino, and you're lucky to get a machine. We went on a Wednesday night and found it difficult to find one. Stayed maybe 15 minutes and decided to head to Sunset Station. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.I ordered a turkey sandwich on a ciabatta roll with pesto.The sandwich was very dry.I got a side of pesto so I could put some on myself .The pesto was a dry paste with what looks like parsley and basil,so it didnt help much.The ciabatta roll is like what you get in pack of hamburger rolls.No crustiness.The steak fries were great, nice and crispy.My gf ordered a turkey burger,was ok,just a Sysco patty.No big deal.Took a look at the salad bar,there was some pizza other than that just the very basic items.Some looked like they had been sitting out for awhile.Service was good. Our servers,cashier and a lady that I got the impression was a manager were all super nice.For having it's own brewery I was surprised to see the bar empty.I get the feeling that this is the red headed step child of the Station Casinos.I think that if Station Casinos wants to have a property on nearly every corner like 7-11s they should put more effort and resources into them.No reason to go back here."}
{"text":"Decided to try Barleys for dinner with my roommate the other night. The smell of old bacon wafting in the air outside should have given me a clue. And if it didn't, the sticky table, cold tea, and dirty menu should have. Or perhaps the staff who don't even know the food to help suggest something. They're probably smart enough to eat elsewhere. Did I leave at this point? No. No, I did not. Why not? Because clearly I'm an idiot. My roommate got orange roughy that I could smell from across the table. I got the salad bar and pretty much just ate the baked potato. It's really hard to screw that up. They have old ass pizza at the salad bar, in case you were wondering. Now my roommate and I just talk shit about it every day. Good times.   The moral of the story is if you want a good meal, don't go to Barleys. If you need something new to make fun of, however, Barleys is your place."}
{"text":"Ok place to stop in Henderson.  It is super huge considering that its in a strip mall.  Lots of machines and a large board with all the odds for items you can place bets on.  It is a bit smokey, so be prepared if you are a non smoker.  We sat at the bar and tried their house beers.  They were all decent for being on the lighter side, but I guess that is good when its 115 outside.  The bar prices were excellent and the service good."}
{"text":"Good beer and friendly bartender and waitresses. Great value on sports book comped drink tickets. They are good 24 hours from the date stamp."}
{"text":"My first time here a couple of weeks ago was awesome good beer and good times with my buddy.   Unfortunately, that was not repeatable. I came by myself tonight and although the bartender Julie was awesome it went down hill from there.   I ordered the deep fried green beans and I swear it took half an hour to get them. And when they did come out it looked like they were from the bottom of the bag. Every scrap piece ended on my plate. I sent them  back, unsatisfied and had the same plate returned to me with a lame story.   When I asked for the manager, Sebastian seemed to care less whether or not I was satisfied with my food. I can tell you I will NEVER order food here again! Plenty of places in town that appreciates my business.   Would have given them one star, but again Julie was awesome."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time this evening.  I've heard a lot of good things about this place and figured it was about time I checked it out.  First and foremost this is a locals casino. There is a lot that comes along with that.  Usually kind of run down atmosphere, usually the smell of smoke in the air, and a lot of noise.  This place was no different.  As far as the food goes, it wasn't awful.  I would compare it to outback only cheaper, or TGIF/Applebees. It's not awful, it's not amazing.  I will say that the staff was amazing.  A+ for the employees."}
{"text":"The service at the bar was great. I didn't eat or gamble so I don't know about the food or the cocktail service but the bar was a nice place to relax. Not too smoky, crowded, or noisy. This could have been due to the fact that it was early afternoon on a weekday and my +1 and I were the only people seated at the bar. Regardless, the bartender was fun and energetic. She rattled off the specials and was very helpful and pleasant. The pitcher I ordered was only $7.50 and the wheat beer was very good. My only complaint is due to the lack of orange slices. But that is more of a personal preference. She did offer slices of lemon for my beer but i prefer oranges with my Hef. I'll stop in again when I'm in the area and have time for a beer."}
{"text":"Came in for some pizza. It was late and evidently the kitchen was already closed so that sucked. Not really their fault. The waitress was very pleasant and the beer was good. The TVs in the bar make it an excellent place to catch a game. I'll check it out the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Sitting here wondering if I should ask to speak with a manager... Looking for one... No where to be found!  It's 2:40pm and we arrived at 1:55pm and we have not received our food yet!  My bf ordered a burger and we wanted chicken fingers as an appetizer. I told the waitress I was just going to pick at the chicken fingers and she asked if she should bring them both out at the same time... We said \"NO\" - bring the app out FIRST andddddddd we are still waiting ... 45 mins later- NO chicken fingers, NO burger! NO WAITRESS!   Rule 1- patrons need attention- just let us know where our food is at!   30min mark- let your patrons know it'll be 'a little while longer'   40mins in- waitress stops by and says she's yelling at the kitchen for our app..   OK 45mins - chicken fingers arrive ...  -5 mins later ... burger is here and it's dry !   Manager is at the front desk and informs us of upcoming changes to service and food!   I wish this establishment Luck!   Please make the necessary changes!"}
{"text":"Apparently, I was told on good authority, that this is *the* place for prime ribs.  I didn't really order the prime ribs, instead I ordered a steak. However what we did realise is that this place isn't really open late, so if you've been working all day and forgot about dinner, you can't really pop in here on your way home.  It's part of Barley's Casino, but you veer left once you step inside to eat, right is all the gambling stuff.  Lots of booth seating, lots of tables and chairs and the service is actually really lovely. At least the lady that served us was.   My steak came out perfectly, but I do have to say, that after tasting the vegas husband's prime ribs I feel that he should have told me to shut up and ordered that for me instead of letting me order a steak. The prime rib was juicy, delicious and oh so YUMMY.   My steak paled in comparison.   They also have pint sized beer. Even though the American pint isn't as big as our pints back home, it was more than enough and went really well with the steak. I think we went for an in house brewed dark ale that was really nice.   I would definitely go back just to get my own serve of the prime rib."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Always good service and decent food. We like the prime rib. We went last night and they were out of prime rib. So I got the rib eye and it was alright my husband and son got a burger and had to send it back. They said the meat taste sour. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich instead and they forgot the cheese. Not a good night. Now we know only order the prime rib."}
{"text":"Our lungs were engulfed with cigarette smoke as we pulled opened the double doors. We then carefully maneuvered through slot machines and senior citizens and quickly found our way to the raised bar area. I got the special: a $5, 32oz of the seasonal brew on draft!! Huge!!! My friend just got a lite bottled beer. Our waitress was friendly and seemed busy, but service was good. I don't think I'd make an effort to come out here for this place alone, but if I'm killing time waiting for a movie next door at Galaxy, I wouldn't mind stopping in again for a few beers."}
{"text":"I love any place that caters to locals. That alone warrants an extra star. Sometimes, especially in a place like Las Vegas, we take places like Barley's and the Station Casinos for granted because there are so many of them catering to the people that visit their establishments every other weekend. Since I've come from many places that don't favor the locals like this, I enjoy Barley's and the atmosphere.   Now, I can only comment on a couple parts of this casino. First, the bar. I love the bartenders that work until around 1:00-2:00PM; they are very nice, always have a smile, actually act like they enjoy their jobs and maybe even, GASP, LIKE their jobs! When we go in there they recognize us, and almost always we have a Blue Diamond beer and Jameson straight up waiting for us as we get out our players cards. I've ordered food at the bar and they always get it right, and it is some of the best service I've had at a bar. I like coming here, and if you sit at the right place at the bar you won't be blinded by the cluttered casino floor filled to the brim with slot machines.  The other night we went to the Brewers Cafe. I didn't have high expectations of going to this restaurant because come on, a restaurant with a grilled salmon filet and side dish for $13? This can't be good. WRONG. I forgot that Vegas is nice on a budget if you don't become Drunky McGee and lose your life savings at the craps tables. First, the service. I am terrible at remembering names, but this woman was wonderful. Friendly to all of her tables (which is not easy to do at times), and she made me feel comfortable about eating my food (I am gluten free). She didn't push any item in particular to us to increase her sales, quickly mentioned the salad bar and didn't push dessert. Loved it. Nice and easy, in and out, good times.  Now the food. My biggest pet peeve about restaurants is when you order a meat medium rare or, for those who like to eat shoe leather, well done, and when it comes it is the opposite of your order. Seriously, eating well done meat hurts me from top to bottom, and not in the happy way. Moving forward. My fiance ordered the NY Strip medium rare and when he cut it open IT STILL MOOED!!! It was PERFECTLY cooked and lightly seasoned with all that is really necessary for a good piece of meat, salt and pepper. No steak sauce necessary (don't even get me started about steak sauce). They have two kinds of fries, skinny fries and steak fries that have a house seasoning. What? Two kinds of fries at a small casino restaurant? That's right, I take joy in the smaller things in life. He got the skinny fries and was not disappointed.  I ordered the above mentioned grilled salmon. I liked that they didn't dredge it in flour before grilling it, mostly because I am gluten free, but I also do not feel the salmon needs to be floured up to keep in the juices. Salmon is another dish that can easily be overcooked, dry and plain. At Brewer's Cafe? Perfect. They had enough lemon to squeeze onto the fish that could blind your eyes should you squeeze it in the wrong direction. LOVE. The salmon? Perfectly flaky, not overly seasoned or dripping in butter (I know, the rare moment when I don't want my food in a pool of butter), not lost in a flooding of sauce to mask the dryness, just perfect. Also, HUGE portion. HUGE. I could barely finish it, but most people know, if the food is good I will walk, shake and jiggle until I can fit it all in! The side vegetable, green beans, were standard, but also were not terrible. The baked potato? Massive and came with butter and sour cream. Sounds good to me! Let me put it this way, I had a dream about that salmon later that night. Maybe that was the vodka talking, but that salmon was great for only $13! It was no Joel Rubuchon, but hey, it's $13 and at a restaurant called Brewers Cafe in a CASINO called Barley's.  All in all, I think it's great. I don't know much about the rest of the casino, but I do know if I want a more low key night out doing a little gambling and drinking after a hearty meal, I will go back to Brewers Cafe in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"It's a solid place to go to watch a game, whether it be a football, basketball or vgk hockey game. Went here the other day to catch the knights game and I was pleased to see many of the TVs tuned in for that game. The happy hour menu for beer is pretty great, I had the Honey Blonde which is 8% so if you're looking to get slammed relatively fast, look no further!  I cannot recommend the food. The only item on the happy hour was their football burger, which was probably the most bland burger I've had in a while. Imagine the driest, plain burger you buy from a gas station. I should try their other menu items but seeing the other yelpers, the food doesn't seem to be their strong point here.  So why do I give the place 5 stars? Because you should go here for the booze and the game, not anything else (oh and gambling if you're into that). It is a brewery after all. It's far from where I live so I can't myself coming here too often but I love how compact the venue is. It has that sportsbook vibe you get from the casinos but much smaller and easier to access. If I'm ever on this side of town I'd love to come and catch another game. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Wow-  I've heard a lot about this place since it is unique inside of the Station Casinos family being a brewery.  Our friend was able to give us a mini tour of the brewery which was very informative.  I don't drink, but I was fascinated with the process and machinery it requires to make a quality beer.  I was really hungry so I ordered the BBQ burger with steak fries, it wasn't that impressive, but for under $10 it's not like I felt ripped off, I will probably order something else next time.  What I was amazed about was the BBQ chicken pizza, it was one of the tastiest pizzas I've had in Vegas!  (And that means a lot, I'm a huge pizza critic).  The joint is a bit smokey though (as you can expect from a casino/bar) but everything is well spaced out.  I can see this as a great neighborhood place to make a few sports bets and enjoy the game.  Or somewhere to get a quick bite to eat before going to the awesome Galaxy movie theater next door!"}
{"text":"This is kinda like a hidden gem for Me! The food is ridiculously good and the service is so nice, I love it here and I love coming back! So far I've had the chicken cordon bleu and the honey glazed salmon, and they both tastes really good and their tacos are worth trying too."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped by the place because of a 20 dollar groupon that we bought because we were checking out that sweet theatre next door. So we went to there cafe. After being seated we were ignored for a good hour. Even trying to flag anyone down was impossible. The waiter just walked by us as if we weren't there. Finally a bus boy took our order. Salad bar was good. Then they messed up on my check and charged me full price on my card. Completely ignoring my groupon. I will never come here again. No wonder there so dead inside."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  If you can handle the cigarette smoke, the food was decent.  Had salmon....a little dry without any kind of sauce, green beans cooked perfectly and fresh.  Their own amber beer, Red Rock, is pretty good...akin to Fat Tire without the caramel after taste.  Bar staff was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I've dined here several times, and surprisingly, I've never had anything other than breakfast with them, but breakfast is the most important (and sometimes ONLY) meal of my day, so when I'm in the neighborhood (which isn't all that often, unfortunately), I definitely make it a point to go in, sit down, flirt with the waitress and enjoy some of the best food I've ever eaten.  It's a quiet place to nosh, and not crowded at all.  I think you'd enjoy it, and perhaps you'd become a \"semi-regular,\" as I am."}
{"text":"Barleys is a ok small locals casino. It's also a brewery but the beer here is not that great in my opinion. They have nice specials during happy hour and during football games. The pizza is decent and salad bar is alright. I've had a few bad experiences when it comes to service here but I can't complain too much cause the place is cheap"}
{"text":"For the bar area. Thanks to both of the female servers that never acknowledge our existence. Blondie and racoon eyes were too busy cleaning empty tables. We sat in a booth for 15 mins and no one ever said, \"I'll be right with you!\" Nothing! So we came over to the cafe and was helped instantly.   I get its Monday night football, but just let us know you see us"}
{"text":"Very peaceful outdoor patio with full service. Dogs very relaxed tied to outdoor poles. Cold beers delivered by Florida!"}
{"text":"Ordered calzone. Burnt outside and raw peppers and onions inside.  New cook or what. Ate there several times and great food every time. Service great."}
{"text":"The salad bar is legit!   Fresh, crisp veggies, variety of cheeses, egg, grilled chicken, homemade dressings AND they have brick oven cheese pizza, soups and a baked potato section. All you can eat for $5 plus drink purchase.   Why do I choose this place over the \"Sweet Round Red Things\" place?  -No wait usually. Great service. -No screaming, coughing maniac kids rubbing boogers on the booths -It's dark, but light enough to read -If I am with someone who doesn't do salad bars they can order a burger and I can steal their fries:)  It's nothing fancy, but it's just right for me when I am eating clean."}
{"text":"The beers here used to be just HORRIBLE, and I mean HORRIBLE. However there is a new brewer there now and things have improved. Still your standard run of the mill beers, but at least they are drinkable now!  Thanks again Las vegas Beer Tours, without you I would never venture all the way out to this place for a beer!!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here tonight because they sent me a buy one get one free meal coupon, how can i resist???   So we get seated, this guy comes to order our drinks and we both ask for water....he never came back, then another guy asks for our drink order and guess what.. he never comes back! we ordered freakin water for christs sake! So then this lady comes over get our drink order and she brings us some water. finally ahhhh. i was dying of dehydration! its a desert out there u kno!!!!!!    then we order out food, it came out pretty quickly and the corn was kinda overcooked and mushy but other then that i cant really complain too much. we paid and went to go walk over to the bar.  so serious pet peeve, people who sit at the bar where there are games and do not play... if u r going to sit there than play or sit at a seat with no machine. Of course it is full of people not playing and i cant even get a seat. annoyed i left.   this review is one bad experience but i want to say i have had 4 star experiences at this place but this was my first time in their restraunt section.. that part gets 2 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gets props for having it's own microbrew and a awesome happy hour!  I had always driven by this place and never noticed it until the Galaxy Theater opened up. Its a pretty small casino, I didn't see any table games but there is 1 bar and restaurant area.  We stopped by before a midnight showing and turns out they have a great late night happy hour on the weekdays. $2 for their 22oz drafts was such a great deal. They make their own beer and its not bad, in fact its the same beer they have on tap at Galaxy - nice to see neighboring businesses being friends.  The hefeweizen was great and they do have a season blueberry hefe worth checking out. I think they have about 9 different beers on tap all brewed in house which is something you don't see very often. The casino/restaurant is pretty average nothing unique or impressive. Barley's is owned by Stations Casinos so they are on the same rewards/player card system which may interest some. Check out happy hour, get $2 beers, be happy."}
{"text":"They took away the boneless chicken wings. Beer is flat. Guess I won't be coming back here now. Used to patron this place 3 times a week. Bring back the wings and we will come back even though the beer is flat."}
{"text":"great food , great service open at 8 am for breakfast or lunch, we love it , oh and did i mention the hefeweisen growlers we usually grab on the way out ? great beer for a great price , we love this place !"}
{"text":"I came here because I am always looking for new and interesting microbreweries in town.  Barley's was not one of them.  As far as the beer goes, only the hefeweizen was passable.  I ordered the sampler and most of the German-inspired brews were very watery and not at all memorable.  The waitress was very inattentive, it took about 20 minutes after we asked for the check for her to bring it to us, and the crowd was obnoxious.  The best part were the large TVs and the sports book pretty much in the bar.    Barley's is not the place to go if you're looking for good craft beer in Las Vegas.  If you are in the Henderson area, instead go to the booze district and try Joseph James, Bad Beat or Crafthaus.  Or even go more mainstream and try BJs.  Other than the good prices during Happy Hour or football games, Barley's has nothing to offer in terms of quality beer."}
{"text":"We wanted to join a few friends to watch the early game. One of my friends suggested Barley's. We met around 11:30am and the place was already pretty busy. my friends found us seats and waited for the waitress. She came over after a bit of time, and when one of my friend asked about specials she never said anything about pitchers being $5. Incidentally, she also charged me $4 for a bloody Mary that I think should have been $3 but I didn't find out until later so we it go. Bloody Mary's were not that good either, but what does I expect from a casino bar?  We knew it was busy so we tried to give her some slack. She finally brought the drinks and then we never saw her again. After over 25 minutes I finally decided to write our food order down and take it to her. I found her in the service well and asked her if it would help and handed her the order. She was rude and told me that it actually didn't help and then asked the other waitress to deal with me. Her whole side of the conversation was very rude. At this point I no longer wanted her as my server.  The new waitress, Amber was very nice. She told me it actually did help and went through the order with me to ensure she had it correct. Even though Amber was busy she always had a smile on her face.   We ended up ordering most of our drinks from the bar because they were so busy. In my opinion they either should have had another waitress or had one of the bartenders help them.   The food was OK. One of my friends ordered the chicken sandwich she said it was OK. I ordered scrambled eggs and breakfast potatoes. The breakfast potatoes were kinda bland, but whatever we were starving and it was good enough.   The male food server/busser was excellent and very helpful. This experience doesn't really leaving me dying to come back."}
{"text":"A small brewery/casino tucked away in a strip mall, we came here totally by accident. A happy accident for sure. The beer is terrific, the service was lovely, and the food was unbelievably good. Their house bbq sauce is so incredible, our hearts sank when we learned they don't sell it. Noelle was our server, and she was so kind and patient, and definitely helped steer is toward the best food for us. And she never tried to talk to us when our mouths were full! Seriously, come out of your way to try this place, it's more than worth it."}
{"text":"Small--- smoky but the pizza at the bar was amazing!!!   Be sure to get the seasonal beer. Its usually busy so come early."}
{"text":"Okay so this is our local spot! We love barleys Bc he beers are so cheap and really good I like he seasonal brew. The food is pretty good it's bar food, it's cheap so that's fine. Sometimes we get a really good waitress sometimes we get the worst one ever so that really depends on how lucky you get :)"}
{"text":"Best part... A new growler filled at $8.99.  next...Accept that this is casino food first of all, but the micro IPL is great BTW.  It wasn't the best meal but when I stated there was a problem, they were quick to fix it and more than sympathetic to my issue.  I would definitely try it again.   As long as you have a little time on your hands it seems like nicanugh a place."}
{"text":"Although I wont really frequent this place, it's a great place to come before the movie. They have a bunch of $5 beer specials. LIke 32 ounces for 5 bucks. Nice! They also offer a 4 sampler flight of beer for 5 bucks. We went here before the movie and after. The waitress before the show was GREAT. She was quick with the beers and friendly. She didn't have a problem with us splitting the checks (there were 10 of us). The waitress the second time was not as good. She was bustin chops about splitting the bill, so we went to the bar and got our drinks there. My friend ordered a margarita both before and after. The one before the movie had little alcohol, so when we returned afterwards, I asked the bartender to go a little heavy on tequilla. She said margaritas are made in the soda gun and she added tequilla manually. And, she didn't charge her for the 2nd drink since the 1st one sucked. WOW, so cool. I will come back here next time I go to the movies.   Great prices, decent beer and for the most part, really good service.   Beer + 2 hour movie = lots of trips to bathroom"}
{"text":"BEST place for Sunday footbal!! That is where you will find us!! $1 beers and $5 food menu! Most of the staff has been good (Candy, not so great!). Beer is cold, food is decent..no major complaints."}
{"text":"I've came here a few times and always order the prime rib but today I've must have came on their off day because mines came out almost well omg it was so dry. I couldn't even eat it gave some to my daughter and she even said it was dry so I was just sitting there starring at my dry prime rib and drinking my tasty red rock beer lol but I complain after but I didn't want to send it back just want to get my point through and I guess they sent the manager over to apologize which was nice but I don't think I would be back there is so many other places I can go for cheap prime rib like Ellis island lol"}
{"text":"OK so going here was definitely no on the itinerary for the day. I was at the going to watch a movie next door and I had some time to kill so my friends and I decided to walk over and have a bite to eat before the movie. My initial impression of this place was not the best. It smells like smoke and it looks like a huge bar with one little restaurant. We were all in  the mood for pizza and we were stoked to find out that if you sit at the bar you can order a large pizza with 3 topping for only $9.99. The pizza was firewood oven pizza and let me tell you it was beyond any of my expectations. The pizza was delicious and I would definitely go back for it. This casino actually brews their own beer and sells it in glass jars if you want to take some home with you. I tried the blueberry beer and it was the best beer I have every had. I am not a beer drinker at all and for me to actually finish a beer means a whole lot. I ordered a total of three blueberry beers for my friends and I and it was less than 10 dollars. This place serves delicious beer and pizza at stellar prices! I actually wanted to order a second beer but our movie was about to start. I entered this place expecting the worse and left impressed and open to the idea of coming back. If you love pizza and beer this place is meant for you."}
{"text":"I have been there twice. I love visiting local brew pubs and restaurant/micro breweries. The first time I went was a couple of months ago. Based upon the facade in front of Barley's I was expecting to walk into an environment not unlike Chicago's up on the West side of town.  As I walked through the doors I was suddenly in a micro-casino with a sports book on my left. Other then the few brew tanks I could see in in front of me, this was just not what I had expected.  I was with a buddy of mine and we went back to the \"Brewer's Cafe\" for dinner(Denny's-like). Prior to ordering our food, I ordered the beer sampler. When the tired waitress brought it out, unlike the photograph on the company website https://wildfire.sclv.com/Barleys.aspx showing the 5 small glasses sitting on a place mat with labels, they were just on a serving board with no explanation of the beers I was tasting. However they were all good.  I had a great Club Sandwich and the salad bar. My friend has some kind of steak special they were having that night. The steak was full of gristle and just not very good. This is what we would have expected to get in a dive casino restaurant for $1.99.  Last night I went back, only because my date and I were waiting for a movie next door and we just wanted to grab a couple of beers and an app. We sat there for 5 minutes, as we looked at the two gals behind the bar and nobody even made eye contact with us so we left.  One star for my sandwich and another for my beer. Would have been three stars had we been waited on last night."}
{"text":"Beer is great, the GM is a really good guy and comes out to greet you.  The main host is Bianca and she is just awesome, always responds to you anytime and quickly.  I have been coming here for years but stopped recently as the food really dropped off.  Well a couple months ago they got a new chef and redid the menu and the food is better than it used to be and very reasonable as far as pricing. I like it because it is mostly locals and you do not get the drunk visitors from out of town.  Can watch all the games whether it be football, baseball or basketball.  Beer is very reasonable anytime but specials during the games along with the food."}
{"text":"This place gets ONE star.  The service was incredibly BAD. We were a party of four, we probably went about 11pm. Half of the menu is unavailable, pizzas, stromboli's, breakfast, prime rib, etc, after 9pm.  Probably means in restraurant speak \"we already cleaned the ovens\".  Since there are about four other things you can order...maybe this place should have a late night menu. We ordered boneless wings, a chicken wrap, prime rib sandwich, and a cheese quesadilla. How long did our food take?  Long enough to get hangry.  Probably 45 minutes. Did they make each thing individually? Were they learning to how to fold a tortilla origami style for the chicken wrap? Did they order takeout to be delivered from across Clark County? Nobody knows.  Our server who was also the bartender was one adjective above surly and bordering on rude. On a scale of 1-10 for service I give an F--. She didn't smile once, she actually made us feel like we were bothering her.  We weren't running her ragged she came to the table five times.  We even got our own menus to start and went to her to order an appetizer that someone else brought us. She came once to take the order. One to Drop the order off. One to bring us extra sauces that we originally ordered when she was taking our order but forgot. Once to see If we were ready for the check and ask if we needed anything else and once to bring us extra water that she dropped off with the check. She never bothered to ask if everything was okay. From the looks of it I didn't think the five people at the bar would be a viable consideration of putting her in the weeds. Restaurant speak for running around super busy. The food was typical bar fare, it didn't wow me but it didn't make me sick either. In a town full of Nevada style taverns I'll go somewhere else next time.  A place that doesn't refuse to serve half of their menu. So...no. Just no."}
{"text":"Don't bother with their \"VIP\" party...  The food is gross at the party. They also have false advertising between the physical mail flyer and the website details of the promotion.   They make it seem they are giving a larger amount of money away. It's also not real money; it's free play. They give $100 each to 5 winners. The free play does not show up right away on your card. You will have to come back within 7 days, which they also don't tell you and don't post anywhere. I came back to their establishment to find out my \"prize\" expired. I won't be coming back - ever! I'd probably send their marketing material to the gaming commission, but it's not worth my time. I just want to save someone from going to their awful party in their smokey casino. A lot of things close early in their \"casino\" too.  Don't expect to get much cocktail service either...for such a small place, the girls sure don't come around often! They'd rather gab at the bar. There are so many more better casinos around the area. Skip this one!"}
{"text":"Never I my life have I experienced such humiliation disrespect and embarrassment as I did last night. Kirk the manager your smirking and lack of customer service was disgusting and you should be demoted. Meagan the bartender thank you for the humiliation and embarrassing me in front of customers. Keri you need to learn customer service skills. I hope corporate reads these. I would be more than happy to let you know what happened. I am a president almost chairman. I spend a lot of money at station casinos. But after last night, I will think twice."}
{"text":"The people that work here apparently are your enemies from another life.   That's how they act."}
{"text":"I tried the beer sampler last night.  The beer was flat and I think I could have made better beer in the closet.  I ordered a vodka and club soda after trying a few sips of their beer.  It was weak.  The bar seats are uncomfortable; after 30 minutes I was ready to leave.  Justine the bar waitress was tending the customers at the tables in the bar and the rest of the casino and was doing a fantastic job making sure everyone had drinks so points for service...just work on the beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to try the brews and have some dinner. It took awhile for the waitress to come to take our order- not like there was a ton of people in the bar. I have to admit though,  the service was pretty good overall. The beer prices were really good ($5 for a pitcher). I ordered a pitcher of the hefeweizen which came with a cup of lemons. Good thing because my first sip was terrible. I had to put the lemon in to cut the taste. My husband ordered a pitcher of the amber. He left the pitcher half full on the table. The pretzel bites and pot stickers were pretty good. The ultimate grilled cheese would've been better with bacon or a more flavorful cheese. Just blah. My husbands burger looked as though the patty and cheese sat for a couple hours. The cheese literally looked like wax paper.  All in all, not impressed. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here late last night (or really early this morning, I suppose). It wasn't happy hour since it was Friday, unfortunately. However, they did have a player's card special, which I think was $4.99 for burger and a 12 oz beer. They also had their 3 eggs, 3 bacon/sausage, hash browns, and toast thing for $2.99, but we weren't interested in any of that. I thought my burger was okay, fries were great, and beer was pretty good. It's not too bad a place for locals."}
{"text":"Waltzed in on a late weeknight partially due to curiosity, but mainly due to hunger.  During my brief month living in Las Vegas/Henderson, I'd driven past Barley's quite a few times but never actually mustered the courage to get inside.  The house-brewed beer, while not ready for any beer competitions anytime soon, is still dependably consistent and tasty.  They mainly serve their own brews (and you get a small discount for playing the video poker, hehe) with a handful of other taps and bottles.  My personal favorite this particular evening was their red ale.  The kind server behind the video poker bar recommended the burgers to me -- so I ordered the one with blue cheese and mushrooms, along with a side of fries.  The prices here are so reasonable and the portions are just right, so I didn't feel guilty at all popping in the occasional dollar or two into my video poker machine :)  At the end of my meal I realized I wasn't exactly 'of sound mind and body' enough to drive, so in order to sober up I ordered up some deep fried Oreos with vanilla ice cream.  PERFECTION.  Hot, thickly battered, lightly dusted with powdered sugar, absolutely lovely.  Add to that some outstanding banter with groups of locals young and old, and some fun conversation with a number of employees, and you have Barley's.  I was here late at night -- closer to midnight, granted, where there were possibly at the most about 4-5 different parties in the entire establishment, as opposed to the jam-packed Sunday afternoons I'd witnessed prior -- so maybe the timing of my experience has something to do with it.  But I highly recommend Barley's food and beer, and just thinking of everybody's friendly attitude and hearty laughter puts a gigantic smile on my face :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza and Sweet Chili wings in The Brewer's Cafe. My wife and I ordered their pizza. I have tried MANY pizzas. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised! My only complaints about this place would be that the menu is just a tad too small. Another tip: Anything fried comes out PIPING HOT!!! ;-)"}
{"text":"After chilling in the luxury theaters, I looked to my left and noticed that I was next to Barley's. I had never been in here before and I have made it a personal crusade to try out all of the breweries in town.   Right out of the gate, we had amazing service as we were greeted right when we came in. We sat at the bar and threw a few dollars in the machine. Our bartender's name was Regina and she let us know that they had 32 ounce draft specials for $5. She then let us sample each brew before we committed to a large mug of the brew. Since we were gambling, she was very liberal with making sure we were taken care of drink-wise by offering shots. They had some $5.99 bar bites but I did not indulge as I had just previously eaten my weight in popcorn.   Other patrons there were either quiet and kept to themselves, or actually really nice without being intrusive. For that evening, I really dug that kind of atmosphere. It isn't the type of place where you go to get turnt and dance on the tabletops. YOu just gamble by yourself or chill with a small group of loved ones.   Only negatives: smokey because of it being a casino, but not as egregious as I have dealt with. The Hefeweizen is really carbonated and cloudy. Hefes are my favorite type of beer and this one was such a miss for me. I enjoyed the Red Rock instead."}
{"text":"Staff is unfriendly and crummy pay outs. The restaurant is unpredictable."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and like this place.  Food is good and they serve virtually the entire menu 24-7-355.  They arena brew pub and make 9 different beers on tap in addition to domestics in bottles.  Priced right and two happy hours a day.  Sometimes service is a bit slow, but only during off hours.  Comps are easy for players at slots and VP.  Same card as Station Casinos.  Good mailers as well, up to $900 a month in Freeplay depending on your card tier and level of play."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Barleys when I lived in Henderson and ate beef as the cafe's burgers are second to none in town, especially for the price. The cafe is not really seperate from the rest of the casino so you do get a bit of smoke and the noise. Unless it has changed you need a players club card to get the best deal. Other than the burger and fries Barleys has a good selection of microbrews brewed on site that are, in my opinon, the best in town. My favorite of the brews are Red Rock and Blue Diamond. Overall if you can manage the atmosphere it is worth dropping by for the beer and burgers."}
{"text":"Bar tops seats are filled. Lots of drink and beer specials. Nice variety of beers brewed on site. They also have taster sizes. Cigs rule here. Located right next to their pizzeria. Good service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a 20oz Amber style beer-flavorful and priced at only $4.25.  We used a groupon and ended up paying only $1.60 for 2 people. Quite a bargain."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent the better part of a month TRYING to be regulars at this place, which is an absurd concept in and of itself.  We like cheap bar food on occasions, and the beers are quite great. We even brought a good number of our friends to try the place on different occasions, believing we'd stumbled on a fine, laid back experience. However, I've never encountered a more aggressively rude and unwelcoming wait staff. Every exchange was excruciating. Every minor request was met with a look of consternation followed by snail-paced service.  I think all of the bartenders are great, but I can't stomach more than a single star for an establishment that made me feel like I was continually imposing on them for daring to spend money on their service."}
{"text":"I love that this little local casino doesnt have tacky casino carpet, it actually has hardwood floors. Also, the sports book is comfy, the casino machines are not so packed in that you have a hard time noving about. The cafe has good steak, could add more veggies on the plate but add the salad bar & you have more veggies. The salad bar has excellent pizza, I really dont care for thier salad dressing brand whatever it is but nice choices to add to a salad. The servers are very friendly as well as the host/cashiers. The only reason Barleys didnt get 5 stars is because 2 times I have ordered my steak med well however it arrived med rare. I dont drink beer but my husband does & tries a new one each time, his favorite seems to be the darker ale. I also like that the servers refill your drinks & water constantly."}
{"text":"Warning - great beer. They cater to locals but visitors are always welcome. Stumbled on this little joint (not literally) and what a gem. They do a $2 happy hour for a 22oz craft beer. Hefe is great, chocolate stout is good, blue diamond is good. Their beers seem consistant and they offer good specials. $8.99 growler, $4.99 refill, $2 happy hour, food decent price, etc. As a bonus if you hit both happy hours in the same day, the bartender remembers your name and drink."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and happy hour 3-6! The ladies working at the bar were great and I'd definitely recommend this place if you just want to chill and watch some basketball games (or even place some bets). I am looking forward to my next experience here!"}
{"text":"It has to be said that if you want a decent meal or if you want just a snack to hold you over before a movie at galaxy you need to stop into bailey's. Megan and Justine are the best bar staff in this town and will make sure your drink is always full plus add great conversation alongside the service I love stopping in here every once in awhile to grab some late night grub or come on for dinner because the food really is some of the best I have had at any of the restaurants this side of town honestly what more could you ask for a 5 $ burger. The wings are really good too and there is never a lack of ranch to dip them in or if you are more in the mood for sliders they come in both the bbq pork and burger variety both very good and part of the late night meal specials."}
{"text":"Experience:  stopped in with a few friends to get a beer after bowling across the street at Wildfire. The Amber beer was on tap at the bowling alley, so we thought we'd come over and get some straight from the brewery.   Facility:  not a bad little casino. It was pretty empty for a Sat night. It was about 10:30 or 11:00 and we were one of 3 patrons in the bar/food area. I saw a few stragglers roaming around the casino, but not many.  Not sure how this place stays open.   Service:  decent...nice enough and checked back on us a few times.  The only weird part was, our original waitress was a blonde chic, who we ordered from and brought us our beers, and about 20 minutes later a brunette comes over and asks us if we want to tab out because her shift is ending.  I don't mind doing this because they are ensuring they get the tips before they leave, but who the hell was she?!? LOL!  Maybe she was the bartender. Anyway, we got a good laugh out of it.   Beer:  yum!  They served a nice Amber beer in a liter mug, which hit the spot.  I thought I was back in Germany with a mas of beer!  \"I'm prosting, I'm prosting\"!    Overall:  I would come back for the beer for sure. Again, a little out of the way, but a nice little spot for good beer."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good beer at good prices to be had here. Just left another bar that rhymes with \"bum bummer\" because of  their \"failure of service\" Actually that name would be appropriate for that other bar. Lol also this place doesnt smell like a ashtray like other bars ive been to."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go for happy hour! You can't beat the $5 chicken wings and fries, and also the $3 giant beers that they brew there. The honey blonde beer is amazing, 2 of them and you will have a nice buzz!!! Their pretzel bites are amazing too. I tell everyone I know about this place because the happy hour is too darn good to pass up."}
{"text":"What's the best beer? Cold beer.  Now and then after a 1 star day at work I visit Barley's to enjoy a cold microbrew draft beer and Caveman Keno. The atmosphere and beer elevates a 1 star day to at least 3 stars.    Barley's is an institution at Sunset and Mountain Vista that dates back to the late 90s. Barley's website alleges that it is the Valley's oldest and Henderson's only microbrewery. Barley's attraction is its microbrewery. It is a microbrewery that produces Black Mountain Beer, Boulder Gold Hefeweizen, Blue Diamond Beer, and Red Rock Original. For the record my favorite is the Blue Diamond Beer. The bartenders or mixotoligists serving the beer have been friendly, going so far as to introduce themselves. The upshot of this popular institution, is that the bar is often filled-to-capacity.     In similar fashion to several small businesses, Barley's sold out to a bigger company. Today Station Casinos owns Barley's. The Station preferred card is as good as gold in Barley's. Not only does Barley's gaming machines accept the Station preffered card, they also grant players a \"get out of paying for a drink pass\" when you put money in the machine. In my case, it works out. I put $5 in the Caveman Keno machine and when all is said and done, I break even because the $5 really paid for the open beer that is elevating a 1 star day to a 3 or above star day.     Gaming is fun in Barley's. This is not one of those bars that only offers video poker. This is a bar that features the gaming machines with a spectacular selection of Keno games. And these machines are not stiff. The last time I played at Barley's, Lady Luck struck and I won $100s. That is about the equivalent of 50 Happy Hour Barley drafts. So, sometimes Barley's has the power to elevate a 1 star day to a 5 star day.    Currently,  Barley's Happy Hour is Monday through Friday at the hours of 4 to 7. $2 drafts are the stars of Happy Hour. The Station Preferred card is the star of Barley's. If your gambling, the drinks are on the house.    Barley's is more than a casino, bar, and microbrewery. It is also a restaurant. In recent times I dined there once. To put it nicely their beer is better tasting and a better value than their BLT. A glance away from the restaurant is the brick oven pizza. Although I never tried it, the scent from the brick oven adds a nice scent over the bar.    When you visit Barley's you will come out a winner. That's unless you drink and drive. If the Red Rocks and Blue Diamonds are so good that you've had way too many, there are a few nearby sobering up opportunities. Nextstore is the Galaxy Theaters. Nearby are some decent restaurants including Olive Garden. There is a Smith's. And the CAT bus travels along Sunset Road to Town Square and the Galleria."}
{"text":"Vanessa & janelle were extremely helpful & nice. They had amazing customer service with a positive attitude."}
{"text":"I was actually impressed by this place. It's bigger than I expected and I love that it is right next to the movie theater, perfect for before or after movie cocktails.  The happy hour is excellent- $5 cocktails and $5 apps. We had the boneless chicken wings and they sure were hearty! We also had the Hawaiian pizza which was very tasty.  Yes there is cigarette smoke- it's a LV casino full of gamblers and drinkers; why is this so new to some locals? lol I've been in way smokier places...  We didn't gamble but the service was good, the servers were nice.  My boyfriend really liked the beer they brew there on site and I enjoyed the Moscow Mule on happy hour.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This Casino/restaurant has really fluctuated over time. Unfortunately it appears to have started another downward turn.  They are owned by the Station Casinos under the Wildfire brand name they use for all their smaller properties. If your a gambler, their exactly what you'd expect by a place the Stations owns. Their payouts aren't great (better than the strip, but that's about it) and their players club is very stingy with everything but two for one dining vouchers. If you like to play machines, you can probably fine somewhere better to play at. Just and FYI, they don't have a pit (almost none of the smaller casinos do anymore)  The biggest gambling attraction here is by far their abnormally large Sports Book for a Casino of their size. They have TVs everywhere tuned to sports and this is a great place if you like the Sports Book atmosphere but you don't want to deal with a bigger Casino. They are also pretty generous with their free drink tickets for sports betting.  They are also a brewery, and if you follow my reviews at all, you know I love craft beer. One of the few good things they have done recently is greatly expand their beer menu, which formerly was very limited. They finally added an IPA and a few other staples. Their beers, for the most part, are decent. They make a pretty good red and Hefeweizen, and their new Mexican style pepper beer is very good if you like that type of beer. On the other side, their brown ale shouldn't be called a brown. I actually thought they poured me a stout instead, but it ends up that's what they call a brown... The beer prices are pretty decent too, and during happy hour they are very well priced. There are far better breweries in town though, and any of the other ones in Henderson are superior if your looking for a good beer.  The main reason they have gone downhill though is their new menu. Their prices have sky rocketed and most of their meals are now $14, which is far too high for normal casino diner food. They also have some pub fare, like pizza and appetizers. They tried to upscale the menu a bit and I heard multiple complaints from regulars while I was there (one regular even said he was never eating there again). Their prices were just too high for what they were offering and no one had any good comments on it.  For our first experience with the new menu, we tried the fried green beans, the gyro and the new sriacha bacon peanut burger. The order of green beans was good, but ridiculously small for $8. The gyro wasn't very good and the pita bread it was on had been cooked so long it was crunchy. There was absolutely nothing special about the burger and as much as I love Sriracha, it didn't work here and overpowered any other flavors there. They took their old potato wedges off, which everyone loved, and their new fries are good, but not great. Also they were out of half the side dishes offered on the menu, so my wife got fries instead of the onion rings she wanted.  I thought about saying something about the gyro, but we were already using a two for one and one of the downsides here is the service is always slow. They understaff this place horribly and during sports the cocktail servers handle the food too if your sitting outside the restaurant. The servers are always very nice but there is only so much you can do when one server has a small casino floor and multiple tables to take care of.  If you come here for the food, you will probably be disappointed (two stars for food, one star for the new prices). I also wouldn't come here to gamble, with the exception of the Sports Betting. Really the sports and beer are the only reason to come here anymore, though I would try the food again with a coupon and hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Waiting to see a movie at the nearby Galaxy Theater?  Don't mind having to pee during your movie?  Make use of your free time at Barley's and get yourself 32 oz. of beer for $5!  Your wallet will thank you for finding a deal, and your bladder will remind you of that deal, all 32 oz. of it, during your movie.  Barley's brews their own beers, and they have the usual offerings: a hef, amber, stout, a lager, and seasonal offerings.  They are decent, not fantastic, but they get the job done.  Service is hit or miss it seems, so order at the bar to get prompt attention."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer but bad service. I had to walk to the bartender to get served. She either didn't tell the waitress or the waitress just didn't show. Once we got served Appetizers took forever to come out and we didn't get our waters till we walked up to the bartender again."}
{"text":"I used to live right by Barleys and I would go there to watch football games, drink cheap beer, and eat cheap pizza.  On game days there pizzas were $5 and the rest of the time they are about $7.  I went back there recently because I heard they were having a Brewfest.  The Brewfest was pretty sweet and after embibing a bit I decided to grab a pizza.  Now this wasn't the best pizza I've ever had in my life but it was pretty darn good!  For the price, it was a steal.  Their beers are pretty delicious as well and they offer a sampler of them that isn't too pricey.  On gamedays this place was always jam packed but any other time I've been it was empty, which can be good or bad.  The inside is nice ad the decor seems pretty up to date.  I've always had fine service when I came.  Bottom line: not a bad place to grab some great beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"Great beer, friendly staff, the patrons are even friendly, nice."}
{"text":"What can I say not sure what size it was but either a 24 or 32 oz craft beer for $2.00 during happy hr.  Out bartender was cool.  I'm not saying be an a$$ kisser, but when we use to go here a lot, one of the bartenders was always so friendly.  Idk, maybe she was having a bad day!  We all deserve one from time to time.  I won't rush to go back there, only if were seeing a movie or just in the area."}
{"text":"I went to Barley's for Sunday brunch with out of town guests. We're both big microbrewery fans so I was looking forward to checking out Barley's for the 1st time. We had kiddos with us so we went to the cafe. He ordered a custom made omelet and I ordered the El Benedicto breakfast special. We selected bloody marys and the lime & spicy pepper beer.   The server was friendly but service was awfully slow. The bloody marys were flavorful yet really small. The beer was super light almost watery and didn't have hardly any jalapeno pepper kick or salt and lime taste as the menu described. The omelet was delicious but the southwest style eggs Benedict was pretty bland and the plating was thrown together and sloppy looking. No garnish and monochromatic. Not really apetizing visually or in actuality.    As far as the kids portions for breakfast and the spaghetti and meatball kid's meal was enjoyed very much by the kids and the portions were huge. The serve ice cream with the kids meal so that was a nice little bonus that my daughter enjoyed very much.  Overall,  Barley's will not become a regular stop for food or beer."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer the salad bar at Barley's to Sweet Tomatoes.  The ingredients are fresh and the lettuce is crisp.  Best of all, I don't have to pay extra for my protein.  Score.  The salad dressings are good.  I have a deep, abiding love affair with garbanzo beans and black olives, and this salad bar had both.  Another score.  The service is a little.... eh.  I mean, the waiter brought me my drink and my check and that's about it.  He didn't bother to clear my plates or anything, but I guessed he just assumed he wasn't getting much of a tip anyway.  I guess that's how it works.  I think the price is very fair - $7.99 for soup, salad, pizza, and baked potatoes isn't bad at all.  I definitely filled up and felt satisfied.  I can't see myself CRAVING this place, but if I want a fresh, relatively no-frills salad, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for locals and visitors. The beer is excellent and the happy hour deals are really good."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Brewery Stop #5  Barley's is located in Henderson, a good 15 minutes outside of Vegas. It was nice to see the area besides the strip...where actual people live and play. The bar is in the center of the casino. We sampled:  Blue Diamond Beer - lager Black Mountain Beer - dark lager Boulder Golden Hefeweizen Oktoberfest  The beer wasn't my style...all were very light bodied, due to the fact they were mostly lagers. Growlers were only $8.99 and $4.99 for refills! I wish I liked them more. This place did have charm though as a casino though. Well spread out and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Finding ourselves on this side of town last night, my husband and I popped in for a beer and a quick bite before our plans with the family.    Happy hour is from 3-6, and we remembered that they have pretty inexpensive beer.  Well.  Service has improved quite a lot since our last visit.  Our server was Dakota, and she was great.  She gave us recommendations, chatted, talked about the menu, and she was quick to bring our drinks and checked on us.   Last night we tried a hefeweizen for me, which was delightful, and a spicy jalapeño beer for my love, which was amazing.    Prices couldn't be better:  $3 for a 16 oz beer, $5 for pretzel bites with 2 different sauces...and then $8.99 for a 64 oz growler of the spicy beer....refills are only $5!  SOLD!  I'm glad we stopped back in.   We definitely plan to come back again, and SOON!!"}
{"text":"if you like beer...come to this brewery.  Perfect little place to game, dine and hang out, even have a sports book.  One of my favorite places to come hangout.  Bartenders are awesome"}
{"text":"Not bad. For $10 I got a healthy plate of Mahi Mahi with a tomato chutney garnish, green beans and potatoes. Nothin' fancy to make a big fuss about; just a decent meal. The beans were seasoned well and the fish was cooked perfectly. I dipped the potatoes in ketchup.   They have $2 drafts at random times, which is a good deal for Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night and ordered at the bar  1. NY steak and potato - 10 2. Mahi Mahi - 10  Used the $10 Groupon for $20 to cover the meals and left $3.   - Brewer's closed at 8pm, so we went to the bar instead.  - This place is also a Station Casino. A lot smaller scale.   - Service was very friendly.  - Initially, I wanted the prime rib, but the waitress said they were all out that night. fail.  - This place can't cook a steak. I asked for a Medium and they gave me a Rare. Manager came and said they would make another. This time I asked for Medium well hoping that it would be easier, but they gave be a tough well done! I didn't want the chef to go through the hassle and making another one.  - Ahi Ahi was bland. Add your own salt and pepper. But expected since labeled healthy choice.  - Potato was boring. I can make a better potato at the Feast buffet!  - Although the service was very good, the food was very sub par. Cooking steak should be mastered 101 for a chef"}
{"text":"Wow!  Imagine my disappointment when I ordered the BBQ ribs. Not only were the dry and tough. All the sides were almost as bad. The cornbread muffin was dry and had dried up corn inside. The corn on the cob was so dried up it was almost translucent. Coleslaw didn't have much flavor. The baked beans had little flavor But was better than the other sides. The best part of the meal was the French fries. I'm just glad we had a coupon for buy one get one. My husband said the ribeye was good but chewy. Baked potato was really good. Green beans under cooked. Very disappointed. The staff were polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Barley's Brew Pub is a small café inside a casino.  At 3:30 pm on a Thursday I was the only customer.  The service was fast and friendly.  The menu is small and some of the prices are on the high side for the location, quality and ambiance.  Spaghetti with meatless sauce is $12 add 2 meatball and it's $16, the salad bar is $9, dinner entrees are about $15.  I had the turkey club sandwich which came with fries.  The sandwich was average and the fries were really good.  I wasn't offered any happy hour or daily specials menu.  I didn't find Barley's Brew Pub anything special a probably wouldn't bother to return."}
{"text":"BBQ buffet for only $12.99. Not bad. Meat was a little chewy and dry but the beer was cold.  Got the IPL, not that impressed. A little too hoppy for me. Everyone pretty much enjoyed their dinner.  The service was great.  Recommend the Mac and cheese.  The kids loved their boneless wings. Overall I may come back."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The bar staff were super friendly and the beer pretty decent.  Regina was great.  We then went to the cafe and that's where everything went wrong.  Service was slow and uneven and the food was bland, bland, BLAND!  Hubby asked for a medium rare burger and it came well done.  My Tuscan turkey sandwich was truly disappointing.  I may be back for the bar and gaming but I will never be back for the food."}
{"text":"I recently came here for the Barley's Brewfest and it was well rounded. It might not have been the best selection of beers and breweries, but enough to get this lightweight glowing. I did not get to try most of the brews I had on my drink list, but I did get one. Banger Brewery did have their El Heffe beer.   The setting was outside in the front of the casino. All the conditions were in favor of the attendees; perfect 80 degree weather, cool beers flowing, and delicious food is a recipe for a fun time.   I did enjoy the BBQ available for purchase. The best items were the keilbasa and the brisket. I am hardly on this side of town, but for this BBQ I might have to change that. As I was walking around, I saw people with jugs of Barley's signature brews. It is nice to know that I can purchase my favorite beers and take them home to enjoy later."}
{"text":"Great food, pretty good beer by Brewmaster Bubba. Always a good time for NFL games! Love being able to drink Vegas craft beer while watching the Patriots!"}
{"text":"Went to check out their all you can eat salad bar for lunch. 7$ is a pretty good price. The staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant was clean, not too many people eating there. The salad buffet is small, it includes soup and pizza. Everything was pretty average, nothing special to make me want to go back. Much rather go to Sweet Tomatoes and pay a few dollars more for more variety."}
{"text":"The place is clean the beer is very cold and the staff friendly!   A great place to grab a beer before you go to the movies next door!"}
{"text":"I just moved here and this place is right down the street so I thought I would check it out. Also, I love craft beer so I wanted to try the local brewery. Boy was I disappointed. I walked in, was never even greeted. Found a spot by the bar to sit at and was ready to eat! It took about five minutes for anyone to even walk over and greet us. Not to mention they didn't even have menus with them! Asked about the beer and the server treated me like I was dumb. How did I know what they had to drink or any specials, it was my first time there! I was not impressed. After she dropped off one menu for my boyfriend and I to share she never came back. I'm talking about waiting 10 minutes to even order a drink! Outrageous! We finally walked out. I will not return that's for sure. What a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review to an A-OK based upon the following: Barleys Brewfest, staying in business while neighbors closed and their beer remains decent.  The signature brew is Red Rock Oktoberfest Lager."}
{"text":"last 2 times we've been here, they've really disappointed me.Today, my husband ordered a pizza and I ordered the tacos. 45 minuets later my tacos come out, dry with the sour cream hot and the limes hot.like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time. 30 min after that as I wait for my husbands pizza to come out before I eat.I have to get up & ask waitress how much longer for it to come out, she tells me that it was accidentally taken off and it was coming out now. Wtf?really?! My tacos are cold &hard from sitting under the heat lamp, I would have rather you come to me when you brought my nasty tacos out and tell me what was going on. I would have understood, but no you avoid our table.girl, it's called communication!Then you tell us you're leaving so you don't have to help us anymore, but we see you walking around helping other customers.so sad because this was one of my favorite local spots..."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" just about sums up Barley's.  First of all, it looks huge from the outside, but once inside it's not really very big at all.  I do like that you can see the barrels and brewing operation.  However, the first impression of this place was NOT good.  Upon entering, we were immediately hit with a horrible sewer smell. Not appetizing, to say the least. That, combined with the smell of smoke, made it almost unbearable.  Anyhow, I ordered 2 beers while my friend found the bathroom.  Their in-house beers are pretty basic: light, dark, brown and hefe. Although there was a sign and tap that said \"seasonal,\" I was told by the bartender that they currently weren't offering a seasonal. Weird.  Anyhow, the beer was not bad, but also not what I would consider good.  There were also some very shady characters at the bar. This is definitely not a place I am likely to return to, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Sports book manager that was working this Sunday was extremely rude. We were told Patriots would be on the large TV in bar. It didn't happen so 12 of us walked out, and we texted another 10 ppl not to show up. Sports book manager was very unaccommodating, not at all customer friendly, I can not belive how much of a jerk he was."}
{"text":"Relaxing bar atmosphere with good food and decent prices. Kind of feels like Buffalo Wild Wings. Of course there is gambling since it is also a casino. They also brew their own beer there and have a lot of different options on tap.  Check it out if you want a Buffalo Wild Wings feel but with a casino theme. I will go back to Barleys."}
{"text":"Attended the 15th anniversary and had a mixed experience.  How can you knock 15 cent beer, pizza and wings?  I can't, especially when the beer is pretty damned good.  Now the bad news...the service.  I was standing in line at the beer stand near the sports book.  I didn't mind waiting because they were fairly busy due to the cheap prices.  As I got to the front, I was second in line.  The guy behind me asked the guy pouring the beer a question and to my surprise the server asked him what he wanted and helped him.  The lady in front of me turned and said \"I guess we wasted our time standing in line.\"  The other server, a blond lady finally helped us.  When it was my turn, I ordered 4 beers.  She told me that she could only give me 2.  That would be fine except that 2 out of the 3 people in front of me were served 3 each by her.  I only remember that because I was trying to figure out how to carry 4 and was watching how they carried their 3.  If the rule is 2 per customer, fine, but don't arbitrarily enforce the rules.  It made me feel discriminated against and irritated me the rest of the night.  I hadn't been in there for years but was enjoying my night.  In an instant, it turned and now I won't be back over something that could have been avoided."}
{"text":"Go here all the time. They placed a wrong bet because the didn't understand me. Went back 5 minutes later and they wouldn't fix it. Bunch of crap. They lost my business."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for some refreshing alcoholic beverages and watch both the World Series and the Packer v Bronco game. It's a nice set up for sports with two giant screens on one wall, and various smaller screens around.  Beers were only $2 for a large Hefeweizen brewed in house. The beer wasn't bad so that's a good price for a large 24 oz mug. I did order Chicken Nachos and they were HORRIBLE. My stomach paid the price for these later.   Affiliated with Station Casinos, they have a sports book. Same as Wildfire. I'm not a big fan of Station anymore after they wiped out years of points accumulations.   Still on my quest to find a decent place to watch games and have a few beers in the new neighborhood. I like the TV set up here, but the seating isn't as comfortable."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast as the sun was coming up from a hard night of karaoke and booze at Hot Shots. The service was very nice and the food was fresh. I wish they had a late night special, but my friend paid for breakfast so I can't really complain. I got the corned beef hash plate. canned corned beef, but when drunk it is SUBLIME! crispy hash browns and so on. Solid diner food at the right time of day. AAAAAAND you can smoke in the dining room!"}
{"text":"Imperial Nut Brown Ale out today! So delicious! Nutty and hoppy... Hats off to Bubba!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the food is ok but the service time sucks . Mid week or weekend takes over an hour for two people .."}
{"text":"It's small and smokey. I mean you walk into a cloud of cigarette smoke. I couldn't run out of the cloud fast enough.  We moved to the other side of the casino and it wasn't as smokey. I don't think there is a non-smoking section.   Drinks aren't bad at all. I paid $8 for a double rum and coke. It was nice and stiff.  We hardly ever gamble but this time we won almost $100. Would return but only because I am in the area."}
