{"text":"For a hotel restaurant this place is ok. I had the drums and flaps (wings) that won't blow you away but were good enough for a late meal or maybe a happy hour. My wife's calimari was below average with mushy consistency, not the crispy fried calimary we were expecting. If I stayed in the hotel again I would probably  eat elsewhere for a full meal and then come to the bar for drinks afterward. The atmosphere is perfect for watching  a game with multiple screens around the entire room. Being after 10pm, there was no issue with the wait staff or service. As a bar only, I'd give 3+ stars, but if you're eating food don't expect more than a 2 star experience."}
{"text":"Vinnie and the gang are the best.   Great hotel bar, 18 TV screens for wall to wall sports.  Food is exceptional which I'm usually critical of most hotels bars not being.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best hotel bar/restaurant I stay at on a regular basis.  There are so many good food choices in Pittsburgh that it is difficult to stay put, but sometimes your are just tired.  The pierogie of the day never disappoints, the beer selection is better than average.    I like it here."}
{"text":"You gotta try the Champions Pub Burger. It's Angus beef with braised brisket and smoked Gouda combined with crispy onions on a brioche bun. The flavor Is out of this world and the best part about our evening was our Great server Jennifer. She is so nice! Go check it out and ask for her. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This has been renamed: Asada Grill. It's located inside the Doubletree Hotel. I always eat here when in the area for work. The menu is best described as New American. They also have a Happy Hour with specials available. This trip, I had a salmon crostini from the small plates menu and it was exquisite. I wasn't too fond of the fish tacos, but the asparagus was delicious. I additionally had a grilled shrimp Caesar salad where anchovies were added (yasssss... daddy yasss!!). The best part was the thin mint cheesecake. I was told by my wonderful server, Brayden that the cheesecakes are made in-house and there is a new flavor everyday. Will I be back? But of course! Should you come pay a visit? Umm... have you been reading what I wrote? Let me recap.   Three reasons to come here: 1. Brayden, the best server this side of the Mason-Dixon. 2. The food! 3. Caitlyn's cheesecakes  Ok! Now come!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but the food was pretty decent. Really enjoyed the french dip and french fries (crispy and shoestring!) and the wing sauce was really great as well. Service was good."}
{"text":"Expensive as hell but the food and service is worth it. The old guy, Andy, who bartends is legit AF."}
{"text":"Located inside of the Double Tree by Hilton. The restaurant itself is quite old and run down. Could use a freshening up. The floors were quite dirty and everything seemed out of place. The hostess could have cared less that we were interested in a table. The hesitated to \"bother finding us one\". After ordering 3 different drinks off of their menu, the server could only offer me one. The server we had was DAVE. He himself is spectacular, makes you feel comfortable and welcomed, kudos to him!A genuinely sweet man who gives you his honesty. For appetizer he chose the calamari. Highly recommend! The breading is perfect and crunchy, with a tangy sweet Asian glaze and a wasabi type dip. We also ordered the French onion soup which I returned back to the kitchen. The broth had a creamy strange twist that I couldn't swallow. For entree I ordered the angus burger. Very interesting, it was topped with pulled pork. Quite tasty except even though I ordered medium rare the meat was burnt beyond edible. Fianc√© order chicken sandwich and it lacked any seasoning. Overall the place is good if you just want to catch the game on their many large screen TV's but as for food, the entrees are overly prices for low quality."}
{"text":"Never did I expect to write such a positive review for sports bar-ish place called \"Champion's Club\" which is alternately spelled \"Champions Club\" [sic] including on this site. AND, it's a hotel restaurant, to boot. If you enjoy perfectly poured pints and burgers cooked the way you ask, then I'd say come here--or at least eat here once while you're at the DoubleTree.  Upon my meandering down to one of the hotel's two restaurants (the other being called Seasons, or something like that), I was greeted by perhaps one of most friendly (and not overly friendly) and attentive bartenders that I've ever encountered. She gave me recommendations on the local beers, none of which I had ever heard. I decided to go with, if I remember correctly, Maxwell's Scottish Ale which was perfect and nicely poured.  When I got around to ordering, there was another bartender who was floating around and asked me if I wanted to order food but the vibe this girl had made me feel like I didn't want to order from her and I kind of already trusted the first bartender from the beer recommendation. So, I simply said that I wasn't ready to order yet, and patiently waited until the first bartender came around again. Needless to say, my patience was rewarded. I asked about the brisket panini. She was able to alert me that sometimes it's dry but that if it's not, then I should go with it. Turns out, it was dry--but luckily she checked for me before I ordered--and I ordered the All-American Burger instead. The burger itself was cooked exactly how I asked--medium-rare. It came with sharp cheddar, grilled onions, and bacon on a toasted brioche bun. It came with a side of fries (or coleslaw, if you so choose--though, this is Pennsylvania so I chose fries) which were fresh shoestrings.  All in all, I'd say it was an overwhelmingly positive experience. There are large HD screens for games (it was Saturday--so the Mountaineers were playing the #4 Sooners). It loses a half star for it's unimaginative menu and and another half star for its other staff (with the exception of the cook) including the hosts who seemed bored and went on about their jobs in a rather perfunctory manner."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever had in my lifetime. Waited 45 minutes for a table and have already been waiting a hour at my table and still don't have food. I understand there was a home game today. But as a restaurant you need to be prepared for a crowd. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Feeling trapped? Don't worry because Champion's is good for your food and beverage needs!  I stay at the Doubletree near the airport on most of my trips to Pitt. It is convenient to the airport and not too far from downtown. The only drawback is that the nearest restaurant aside fro Champion's is two miles away and more often then not I don't have a car.   Not a worry though because Champion's has a fine selection for small plates and full courses to meet your needs.   The restaurant is a sports bar with a number of sets all showing different events. The crowd is mixed but mostly business travelers who tend to be courteous.   The bar staff is excellent though I admit my needs are simple; whiskey, bourbon or craft beer.  Since the bar carries my favorite bourbon they are perfect   I've had several of the small dishes and their famous \"Pub\" burger. The food is 3.75 stars which I've rounded to 4. The burger and fries were top notch but their calamari was dull.   In the morning they serve a buffet breakfast which compares to most American hotels. I wish we could take a lesson from the Japanese on how to put together a breakfast spread!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I just had the standard meal. Was a little more pricey than i expected. Not some place ill crave and have to have but also a place ill probably come back to."}
