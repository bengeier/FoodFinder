{"text":"Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   

Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  

I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \"what it is.\"  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!

While the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure."}
{"text":"I must say that I'm disappointed with Alexander Michael's. For the most part, each time I've dined there I've enjoyed the food. I'm a huge fan of the veggie burger and fries, and the prices are reasonable. The space is great, and I adore the 4th Ward neighborhood. In fact, I live there. 

That said, I've been consistently underwhelmed with the quality of service that Al Mike's delivers to its patrons. On a couple of occasions I've felt as though the server did not really care much about my dining experience. As an example, recently I went with a friend who explained to the server that she was gluten intolerant and order the GF pasta. Despite that, her pasta came with two slices of bread on top. To me, that seems like something that should have been considered, and if it was an honest mistake, that would have been ok. However, the server acted as though it was preposterous that she asked for another plate. She was extremely disrespectful despite the fact that my party was respectful towards her. I really want to like and enjoy this spot and I think the food is great, but the experience of eating out is 100 percent framed by your service and on a couple of occasions it's been subpar to horrible at Al Mike's."}
{"text":"Their turkey club croissant is amazing. Such a good lunch stop!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite dinner spot close to the house. Everything we have had from there has been great and it's the most cozy feeling restaurant around.  They get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday but the wait is normally pretty sort and worth it. The crab soup is out of this world good and no visit complete without it."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  I never would have known about Al Mike's (as it is known casually) without reading the reviews on Yelp.  Most people said very positive things, so we decided to go here for my birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us, and then 7 on a Saturday night.  Granted the weather was terrible, but we were easily seated at a comfortable table in the middle of the restaurant.  The waitress put up with our indecisiveness with grace and humor, and answered all of our questions very nicely.

Our group started with the Fried Pickles, and even with that many people one order was enough.  Of course, if you know Fried Pickles you know that too much is not a good thing.  These were light and not greasy, even though they came out to us super-hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Their ranch dressing was wonderful, and really complimented the sharp dill taste of the pickles.

Our entrees arrived very quickly, and our table ordered everything from one of the specials, to pasta, to a burrito.  All reports back on entrees were positive.  We had a vegetarian in the group and he was easily acommodated by their menu.

My Feta Chicken dish was chicken (duh) served over penne pasta with lots of veggies and covered in feta cheese.  The taste of the dish was great, and my only complaints had to do with texture.  The sauce was more of a broth, which is how it was described in the menu, but I guess I was expecting a bit more structure to it.  And, the chicken was tough.  Flavorful, but tough.  The rest of the dish was great.  The feta was lively, and there were some wonderful mushrooms in the sauce that were a treat to discover every few forkfuls.

Because it was my birthday, I got a free chocolate brownie!  It came out with a little candle in it, which was very sweet.  Our group also ordered the bread pudding.  Between the two desserts, I think the bread pudding might be the superb choice even though I'm a chocolate girl through and through.  It had a complex flavor that was just delightful.  The brownie was good, as really all brownies are.

I prefer wine, and while the wine list is not extensive here I was perfectly happy with the pinot noir on the menu.  If you are a beer drinker, than this place has a ton of options for you!  The rest of my group drank beer, and heartily enjoyed it.

I am so glad to have found Al Mike's, and I strongly recommend that you make the effort to find it in the 4th Ward.  It's easiest to get to off Graham Street - just turn south onto 9th and it's a block or so up the road.  Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Housed in an old general store and meeting house, the atmosphere is wonderful and the menu gives you all the interesting history of the place. But more importantly, the food is excellent, the service great and the prices very reasonable. Also portions that are properly sized for normal people - only one doggie bag among the 3 of us. Can't think of a thing to criticize. Go! You'll enjoy it. Don't let the \"dead end\" street sign and neighborhood aspects confuse you. You're in the right place to find this hidden little gem."}
{"text":"The world would be a better place if there were more establishments like Al Mike's.  Honestly, the food itself earns no more than 3 or 4 stars, but anything less than five stars for an overall grade fails to recognize the value of this place to Charlotte.  If you don't enjoy dining and/or drinking at Al Mike's, you do not know how to enjoy yourself.

It is a fun atmosphere in a charming building in a delightful uptown  neighborhood.  If you are visiting Charlotte, you have to check it out.  If you live in Charlotte or near Charlotte, you should be a regular."}
{"text":"We would have never found this place had it been suggested.  Good American food,  good drinks.  A little hidden Charlotte gem."}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner here and really liked it! The place is adorable, the service and the food were pretty good also."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to charlotte and after searching the areas restaurants for 45 min I finally settled on this place and there are definitely no regrets! Service, food and drinks were fantastic, the atmosphere was classy yet casual. As mentioned in another review, this is a great date night spot. My husband and I both highly recommend. If I'm ever down this way again I am most definitely making a trip back here!"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the group.  A hidden gem here in Charlotte.  As you sit in the restaurant and watch the horse and carriage go by, you feel like you're in some other city.
Great atmosphere and food.
This was me and my husband's first date...per my suggestion(he was new to town)."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch here on a Thursday.  Service was fast and friendly.  The menu is basic pub fare and you get just what you expect.  There were several groups comprised of business professionals on their lunch break.  It was a very pleasant atmosphere.  I recommend Alexander Michael's for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome local place! Not easy to find but worth looking for! I recommend What It Is and a nice cold beer! Great draft selection!"}
{"text":"The perfect pub: food, brews, atmosphere, service, prices"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Love the atmosphere. The food is always delicious and the employees are so nice. Definitely a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Charlotte-Uptown and LOVE this small neighborhood bar! Great beers on tap and bartender was friendly and helpful! Haven't eaten here yet and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to go in Charlotte.  The food is really good and the service is outstanding.  This is truly something for everyone on the menu.  The location is reason enough to go as the neighborhood is one of the more unique places in Charlotte.  The beer selection is also fantastic"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had since moving back from Columbus! If you are ever in the area, Alexander Michael's is a must eat. I had Cajun Cream Chicken Alfredo and by far one of the best cream sauces I've had in a long time. Nothing beats prepared from scratch. The service was impeccable, not hovering over us and pressuring us to order. She made us feel like we were her only table. The prices were very reasonable and I would've paid a lot more for what I ate.

Thanks Alexander Michael's and Charlotte's Fourth Ward for an awesome end to my to short of a visit!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a chill dinner and drinks. A very laid back atmosphere makes it perfect for dinner before heading out or just relaxing all night. It has a bar atmosphere without the crazy drunks and extremely loud crowd. The food isn't 5 star, but you can never go wrong with Fried Pickles and the What It Is. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great place, and the best fried pickles I've ever had. Thanks Yelpers, for suggesting to out of towners."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Food was great and so was the service. Perfect comfortable neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"As much as it was mentioned in every single tourist guide i could find of Charlotte, this is a homey, family restaurant with soul and a great vibe to it, NOT a tourist-magnet in any way shape of form. The people that work there were down-to-earth and friendly to the core. The service was swift, the mood great, the food delicious. What else to say? Love that place!


TIP: Try their fried pickles! Oh my sweet goodness... best culinary surprise I've experienced in years. I was dying to order a second round of them because... wow... they were so good."}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place.  Great atmosphere, great date place, great bar, and great food!  You must try the nachos!  Everything on the menu is good, and they have Warsteiner on tap!"}
{"text":"I had some out of town guests this week, and I took them to an ole favorite.  As usual Alexander Michael's didn't disappoint.
The staff is super friendly and overly accommodating.  They have my favorite; Gentleman Jack, so it's always an extra point when a bar carries my brand.  We had some appetizers and settled in for drinks and conversation.  It's a quaint restaurant in the heart of downtown.  The food is great and so is the service.  I hope you continue to be a staple in Charlotte for many years to come."}
{"text":"Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place for its micro beers and spicy crab soup. The london broil looks amazing but i did not try it. Five people at my table ordered and greedily scarfed it down leaving crumbs not even fit for a mouse. Hehe ya that good! Can't wait to waunder in again and i love that they have local meats on there menu.
Our server was so sweet too."}
{"text":"First off parking is an absolute bear! Park free at the local County Office (Hal Marshall @ 700 N Tryon) walk 2-3 blocks and you're there. This cozy location offers a great throwback feel with a surprising amount of beer on tap! chicken wrap is a great quick lunch option; toss it in Buffalo if you're feeling spicy."}
{"text":"This nice little hole in the wall is a gem to visit. The food was delicious and people are friendly.  I had a steak sandwich with their chips. Overall I would recommend this to anyone if they have some time"}
{"text":"Atmosphere wasn't my thing. Dark and depressing but food was fairly good."}
{"text":"Incredible. Had the blackened catfish and the Cajun fries - blown away by the taste and the spices. I will come back when I am here next to try the Jambalaya, although I must say I am disappointed they don't have a gumbo on the menu. But gumbo or no gumbo, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Great food! Honey chicken pasta is highly recommended. Great for small groups but no reservations, first come first serve. Nestled in 4th ward, for nice walk to uptown."}
{"text":"Brought family here from out of town and glad we did. Service and food were great. Staff was welcoming and the bartender helped us find beers our guests would like. Server made good, honest suggestions about the menu and checked on us throughout the night.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Luckily for me, this restaurant is only a five-minute walk from work so it's always one of my top choices for lunch. The London Broil sandwich wasn't as medium-rare as I'd ordered, but delicious nonetheless. 

One thing I appreciate about this restaurant is the frequency of daily-specials they offer during lunch. Everytime I've gone, they've offered at least two specials of the day, which shows some kitchen character. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the fried chicken with a side salad and steamed broccoli! It was served hot and was simply delicious! I will come back!"}
{"text":"Located in one of the few neighborhoods in Charlotte that hasn't been completed torn down and rebuilt, Alexander Michael's is a great neighborhood watering hole. We took a party of 5 who all have different tastes, and everyone found something they loved on the menu. Highly recommend for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"In 79 reviews, no one has given this place below 3 stars.  That should tell you all you need to know.  Consistently good bar food in a quiet, pub-like environment. Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.

If I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. I went solo and loved the single booth in the back corner. Busy. It had a really nice ambiance. The What Is It chicken, now called seasonal chicken or something vague was totally awesome. Moist and flavorful."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pita with pasta salad on the side. The actual pita was SO delicious - buttery, crisp around the edges but soft in the middle. The chicken was moist, tender, and very flavorful. The pasta salad was nice and simple. My dad had the Reuben and said it was \"packed with flavor.\" He ordered a side of Cajun fries, and I tried some but they just tasted like regular fries. Maybe they got our ordered switched up, but if not, the Cajun fries weren't very Cajun (good fries in general though!)"}
{"text":"I have to laugh b/c this is the second time I find myself quoting Nicole W. but she said it best \"Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food, good drinks and superb company all packaged into a quaint little spot in the 4th ward.\"

Especially if you live within walking distance, this is a place you will go again and again for an uncomplicated place to find simple food done right with quality beer selections.  I had the chicken pita.  I was not expecting that the chicken would be perfectly cooked, seasoned and the pita warm and robust.  A side of beans satisfied an additional protein craving without the temptation of the go-to french fries.

The place is too cute explaining on the back of the menu why there is a beam in the ladies room which finds itself the victim of unsuspecting visitors who inevitably find themselves in close contact with the supporting structure.  They also give some history on the house which makes good reading while you wait for your first round to show up.  

Small complaint that again, tv in the dining area.  I guess many people eat in front of the television at home and grow accustom to it?  Also, low ceilings make for a cozy atmosphere.  Probably not the #1 place for enjoying the natural sunlight of a gorgeous day."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is. I ordered steak which came out luke warm and over salted. It seemed old. Also my veggies weren't seasoned at all and were not even steamed. Not interested in returning."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood spot! My husband and I call it the 'Cheers of Charlotte' where no matter who you are or how many/few times you've been there, you will always be made to feel welcome and like a friend. Perfect for a night out or just to grab a drink and apps. The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy. Charlotte's best hidden gem!"}
{"text":"No more the best kept secret? Depends on who you are and how adventurous you are in the QC but it is good to see reviews of people digging the vibe. Coming to this city in 1989 I got to experience the 'Signature Spots'. Many aren't around anymore so it feels good to drop in and enjoy Alexander Michael's.  *Tear of Good Vibes*. The atmosphere has always been great.  Both bar and dining experiences cool.  I've had some adventurous times over the years that included this venue.  I thank my friend Patricia for bringing me to her spot that became my spot.  A night on the town we would drop in before or after. It's a great date night venue after the dope-amine wears off and you can be yourself . LOL  I love how if you are a regular many times depending on who was working they remembered your name. Nice touch. It is an inviting Tavern. 

Some Fav's At AM Restaurant and Tavern

*Fried Pickles, Black Bean Hummus, Blackened Catfish never overdone when ordered, Picky on my Rueben's but they do a very good job.  It's a temperamental palette thing, I have to reign it in for getting grandiose at times.  The wings hit the spot and crab soup succulent not overdone. After I'm done grab the Creative Loafing and a very satisfied customer I am.  Another visit is due soon. 

BEBE"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good, with a decent selection and relaxed ambiance. However, the service was bad.  It may have just been a slow night, so I definitely plan to try it again!"}
{"text":"I love a good local pub at the end of a dead end street. Dimly lit, neighborhoody, but classy, great food, friendly staff. My idea of a nice time."}
{"text":"On my way up to new york from florida my girlfriend and I stopped in Charlotte. We read a bunch of reviews about this place and decided to give it a shot. WOW. The food, drinks and service were all amazing. Crab soup is to die for and so is the black bean hummus. GF got the veggie burger and I got the London Broil. Both were spectacular. I highly recommend this quaint location if you only have one night in Charlotte and want some of the best they have to offer. They were also able to offer great advice on what to do in town. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I had a great time here last night. Good beer selection and tasty food. I had a watermelon beer which was really delicious, the nachos are great as well. I am looking forward to coming back for more."}
{"text":"I don't live in Charlotte anymore, but when I did I spent many delightful evenings at Alexander Michael's. It is hidden in a little neighborhood in the fourth ward. If you aren't looking for it you might miss it.

It can get busy, but the staff is super friendly and fast. You won't have to wait that long for a table. One of my favorite things about this place is their fried pickles. Now, if you live in Charlotte you might try to tell me that the Penguin has the best fried pickles. I would politely agree to disagree (well maybe not that politely, I am a little obsessive about food). Because these fried pickles are the perfect combo of grease and crunch. How I miss them . 

Another gem about this place is it's history, It is in an old Victorian house that I think used to be a mercantile. The decor is dark, and inviting. There is a booth in the back with a bench that just sits two. Perfect for a romantic rendezvous. 

Not too shabby of a  beer selection either."}
{"text":"I just adore this area, and I have always wanted to try this little neighborhood pub out. We were greeted by a friendly man working the bar and he pointed out a small booth in the back that was available for us to sit at. It was a cozy little wooden booth. The atmosphere is warm and quaint with memorabilia and other random decor lined up and down the walls. Our waitress was polite and kind. We ordered the soup/salad combo and one of the specials. Any passing by waitress who noticed our water was low would fill our glasses, showing their attentiveness to customers. Food was delicious and their crab soup in particular was flavored wonderfully! Services was great, atmosphere was great... we will definitely be back to visit in the near future :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful location in the nest of some of Charlotte's downtown Victorian homes. The food is also very delicious and you can't find anything on the menu you don't want to try! If you're ever in this area give this local restaurant your time and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great casual evening. Perfect for a neighborhood bar or a couple or two. The Spicy She Crab soup and the \"What it is\" are amazing!

I went for a quiet birthday dinner and it was exactly what I wanted.  Great place to walk around after dinner as well."}
{"text":"I am boring lactose intolerant but Steve the owner personally put together a yummy dish for dinner. Made me feel included in the meal like my friends. Great spot, friendly, delish and attentive. No wait."}
{"text":"Order the grilled chicken pita or the What It Is!!  These are my go-to dishes at Al Mikes.  The grilled chicken pita is just grilled chicken, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes but it tastes amazing.  Get the Cajun fries with it and you will have a tasty meal!  The What It Is is blackened chicken on top of Cajun Alfredo sauce pasta. It's insanely good!  I've tried making it at home with a little success but it doesn't compare to how Al Mike's is! The owner and employees are all super friendly.  I really love that the restaurant is in an old Victorian style home nestled in Fourth Ward.  It's so cozy feeling.  Definitely a favorite stop! :)"}
{"text":"its a nice old place in the 5th ward. i did my first dinning there when i came to charlotte. l like their corned beef. we asked extra pickles and got a lot! :)"}
{"text":"I am beginning to wonder if I'm the outlier of the group, or avoiding the trappings of groupthink.  I just don't get all the adoration.

Location, decor, and ambiance, all get five stars.  Alexander Michael's brings everything we love about pubs and taverns to life.  Tucked in a nook of the 4th ward, Alexander Michael's adds a welcoming place to meet some friends, in an already welcoming neighborhood.

Great taverns always have a few things in common:  They feel sturdy, heavy and warm.  There is always a boisterous excitement that still allows for secluded conversation, while beaming with cheer and brotherhood.

The food though, just not that great.  Alexander Michael's is the type of place that I love to hang out and belly up...and I probably would if I lived in the neighborhood.  I'd just plan on eating before I came here."}
{"text":"I gave this a 5 star rating, because it's our \"go to\" place.  When we have out of town guests visit us, this is where we usually take them.  It's very casual and a bit loud, but such a great atmosphere!  Try the fried pickles and their IPA's.  Great place.  Great food.  Great beer.  Will keep going as long as they stay open! :o)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The \"what it is\"...so delicious. I'm from Cincinnati and we come here at least once any time we are in town."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Charlotte... Food is amazing!! Only complaint is the size of the place... Really small so it can be difficult to get a table. Although part of the charm is that it's a mom and pop type of place.. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this bar/restaurant. Just the right size to make it feel quaint, but not cramped. We came on a Friday around 6:30 and the place was full, but only had to wait less than 5 min for a table. The food was great! The service was also great! I would definitely come here for a nice dinner or a night out for drinks with friends. It's a nice crowd!"}
{"text":"Al Mike's gets 5 stars because the atmosphere and ambiance are so uncommonly wonderful. From the beautiful wooden ceiling to the lovingly salvaged bar, to the incredibly awesome beer fridge, everything inside says \"Welcome. Stay awhile.\"

second Ace: a lovingly selected beer list. Small, but thoughtful, this one had a few surprises even for me! There's big names like Duvel and Sierra Nevada, local beers from Asheville, Mooresville, and Charlotte, and even a few Germans you might not expect - Neumarkt and Moos are usually not beer producing cities you see in the US. Well, not Chicago anyway.

third ace: the food. Since the restaurant industry is label-obsessed, I'll make one up: upgraded comfort pub grub. Could a few of the ingredients benefit from the upgrade? Sure. But this is not a \"blow your mind with something new\" kind of place. It is a \"let you know that everything is right with the world by doing the simple things well\" kind of place. For example: The meatloaf is tender and meaty. The Reuben -- a sandwich invented at the Blackstone Hotel in Omaha, NE, yeah, that's right NYC, take your 'We invented everything' God complex and stuff it! -- is solid with rye bread that leaves seeds in your teeth, an unabashed amount of salty sauerkraut, and just enough 1000 Island to moisten the affair.

Fourth ace: Did I mention the beer fridge? It's just awesome.

Now, I may not be a big city poker ace, but I do believe four aces is a mighty tough hand to beat.

Checkmate!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and believe this is a true gem in Charlotte.  Alexander Michaels has an atmosphere that is rare in a city full of boring corporate restaurants and pretentious foodie restaurants.   The food is consistently great, and how many pubs in town have their beer taps coming out of an antique ice box.  The staff is all unquestionably friendly and hardworking and lives up to the Cheers standard of knowing your name if you're a regular."}
{"text":"I used Yelp for the first time after a friend of mine informed me of it's awesomeness.  I was looking for a fun night out with my husband and I came across Alexander Michael's, just by chance.  We live on in South Meck county and don't get to explore the depths of urban Charlotte very often so a field-trip was in order.  
I'll start off by saying parking is awful!  If you do not live in the neighborhood and are planning to walk, be prepared.  Most of the parking is by residential-permit only.  We drove around for a good 20 minutes before finding a lot across from the Harris Teeter on W 6th street that was open to the public.  
LOVED Alexander Michael's!  Loved it!  It's a warm, inviting oasis in the middle of the city.  I am an urban-girl by heart, begrudgingly living in the burbs, and this just reassured me that I will be back in the city as soon as the kids are grown and gone. 
My husband ordered us each a drink, (extensive beer list!) we gave our name to the host and hung out near the bar while we waited for our table.  Although the house was packed, tables were turning quickly.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table.  
The staff is very fair about seating.  First-come, first-sat, kind of thing, regardless of your party size.  I would think you are taking your chances with the seating if you have a party any larger than 8 though because it's not a very big place.  
We started out with the fried pickles.  A bit too salty but that didn't stop me from eating half of the basket.  
The owner (I assumed it was the owner; a middle aged guy, very interested in what we thought of the place and very intimate with the menu) came by and chatted with us.  I asked what the house specialty was.  He was not specific about any dish but instead told me what the best sellers were.  I opted for the London broil sandwich and onion rings.  (A best seller)  Someone near us had just ordered it and it looked delicious.  My husband also ordered the London Broil sandwich.  (He does this often and it drives me crazy!)  But he asked for the broccoli slaw.  (Broccoli slaw was a bit bland but the onion rings were great!  The sandwich was pretty good too.)
The staff was in no hurry and that was perfect.  We were not in a hurry.  Our meals came and I talked over and over again about how much I loved this place.  It wasn't the food so much as the atmosphere.  It was neighborhoody and warm.  The staff was incredibly nice and patient and we enjoyed ourselves and our urban experience.  
I will go back again and I have no doubt it will, again, be an awesome experience. 
Thank you Yelp for leading me here!"}
{"text":"The food is OK, but the selling point is it is one of the few places in Charlotte that has culture and history.  An old victorian building in a neighborhood that feels more like Charleston than Charlotte.  Tired of uptown chains and overprices bistros, head to this place.  Great beer selection and a pub feel make this a great pick."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with a bigger group. There were six of us and we had to wait for just a few minutes but it was well worth it. Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was very nice. In our party we had the what it is... Which was delicious and the chicken marsala which was very good."}
{"text":"Located in Charlotte's Fourth Ward, Alexander Michael's was the highlight of my recent trip to Charlotte.  Not only did I enjoy it, but the other 5 members of my group did as well, noting the wonderful food, as well as the ambience (such as the odd pole in the women's restroom) as their own special highlight.  The waitress was wonderfully friendly and helpful (because this was a business trip, we had to expense with separate checks) and the owner even consented to spinning some of the yarns about the stories behind the \"haunted house\" rumors.  He even volunteered to snap our photo as we left the restaurant.   
As for my meal, I got \"What it is\", blackened chicken over pasta, which was extremely tender and welcome after a weekend of too much roast pork the previous weekend in Charlotte.  I even saved room for the bread pudding for desert, and was not disappointed.

You won't find Al Mike's in any of the Charlotte's guidebooks, but it's worth the search, worth the look, worth the trip, and worth your business.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food were amazing. If you only have a chance for one dinner in Charlotte, this is the place!"}
{"text":"freakiin awesome ! i will be a manager starting tomorrow at this amazing place!"}
{"text":"Great local pub in 4th ward, Spicy Grab Soup and Stroganoff were excellent. The Tuxedoed Host at the door is a major plus!"}
{"text":"I've been to Alexander Michael's a few times now and always have a great time.  It has a ton of character - tucked away on a little street of old houses in the 4th ward.  The wait staff is always friendly, there is a nice beer selection and I hear the food is good too (though I've never tried it).  The dining area takes up a large portion of the space and consists of very intimate, cozy booths and tables with dim lighting.  I believe it closes at 11, so it lends itself to a more relaxed crowd."}
{"text":"Really neat place. Has a great neighborhood feel to it; probably because it's in a neighborhood. The atmosphere is fantastic.

Good food. I had their wings and my wife had a salad with grilled chicken. The wings were big and juicy, and they even mixed the sauces at my request. Nice selection of beers"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and tucked neatly away in the 4th ward neighborhood, Alexander Michaels serves up pub food right."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch...a big part of the reason I enjoy coming here is it is a quick walk from Uptown, and the stroll takes you past some pretty funky, old-timey houses in the 4th ward. 

Their burgers and sammies are all very good. I think I've had every sammich on their menu during one lunch or another, and have never given a single one a thumbs down. London Broil and the Cajun Catfish sammich are the best ones. And after perusing the bar menu, I have had to fight off the urge to order a beer to wash them down with every time as well, due to my presence being required back at work. I enjoy pubs that stock such a wide variety of beers, and this one also includes a rotation of fine ales from another favorite spot of mine, Olde Meck Brewery. I appreciate a bar who keeps it in the QC family! 

This bar is quaint...maybe a little TOO quaint. Being that it is in an old, renovated house, the seating can get cramped at times, especially during peak traffic hours. Service gets bogged down too, both by the level of traffic and unwieldy setup. However, these are nit-picky issues that are easily overlooked when good food and hospitable atmosphere are taken into account. 

I hope to come back when I can kick back and imbibe on some good libations! The food alone definitely warrants returning again and again."}
{"text":"My parents were in town this weekend and we decided to take them to Alexander Michael's, simply because I have always felt that this place is exactly what represents Charlotte!

Parking in 4th Ward isnt the easiest. However, we were able to find a spot on the street relatively close. Alexander Michael's is an adorable house in 4th Ward. Please make sure to read the back of the menu for the story about this place! 

The wait was about 45 minutes and the place was standing room only at the time. However, we were able to grab some drinks at the bar. They had Triple C Baby Maker on tap, so I was a happy girl! Lots of local brews!

We started with the fried pickles as we looked over the menu. Delicious ranch. For our meals, I convinced my Dad to order the What Is It, because I have had it before and loved it! I knew it would be right up his alley. He finished the whole thing and really enjoyed his meal. I had a bite and it was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the black bean burger with a cup of crap soup. The soup is absolutely amazing!!! Chunks of crab. This is a must order item every time. The black bean patty was nicely done and i liked that it was served on a pita, instead of a bun. Both my husband and mom ordered the chicken sandwich and enjoyed their meals. 

Service at the table was just ok. To be quite honest, it felt fairly rushed, which is a bit annoying when you wait 45 minutes. However, the guy taking names down for the wait was fantastic. He was really on it! Actually, he seemed like a jack of all trades cause I saw him cleaning a table and bringing drinks out also! He was just so fun to interact with.

This is a great casual spot for a date or just a night out with some friends!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant with a nice tavern/neighborhood feel. Service was really on the ball and likeable. Crab soup, London broil, and veggie burger were all very good. Steamed veggies and broccoli slaw sides were OK. Great spot in beautiful 4th ward"}
{"text":"Around noon had to wait a few minutes for a table. The host who seated us also took our drink order to keep things moving. Server was busy, but staying on top of her station. The sandwiches we had were excellent, as was the broccoli slaw. The place seems deserving of being a local favorite."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a year-and once a year is just not enough.  It's beautiful at Christmas time and gives off that wonderful cozy pub vibe.  Servers are always friendly, and the sandwiches are huge-even if you're hungry, consider sharing the Burger or the buffalo chicken sandwich because not only are they delicious, but they will fill you up.  I need to go back and try the What is Is dish.  Everyone in Charlotte who hasn't been here is sincerely missing out on a local gem."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit of heaven, fantastic food amazing atmosphere and outstanding service. Price very affordable quality mind blowing. Will be recommending and coming back often. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"The fried chicken special is my favorite meal in Charlotte. I would eat it everyday if it was an option and I could get away wearing stretchy pants to work."}
{"text":"Nice being back there after so long. Just as friendly as I remembered and the food was even better. My favorite was the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Milt (out bartender) was great! We were visiting out of town for a friends wedding and needed a mid afternoon pre-rehearsal drink. Our drinks were delicious (spicy bloody: saved my life, a dirty martini and a G&T) and the quesadilla was tasty."}
{"text":"My London broil was good, cooked medium rare like I asked. My side of Cajun fries were a little salty but still good. The menu is not as extensive as I expected; the Cajun options are limited. The spicy crab soup was good too but I wasn't expecting imitation crab meat to be used. I loved the area though, very charming and the servers were great."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I have been here twice now and I can't wait to return again. 
This is a small house converted into a restaurant. I did not notice a hostess stand upon arriving, but each time a man has always been quick to come over to get our name. We've had to wait each time almost 30 minutes (party of 2 then 5), but it was the weekend and it is on the smaller side. So, it's to be expected and totally worth it.  There is a large bar to grab a drink or an appetizer.  

OK, now for the food. House nachos! Or I would say fancy nachos. Pictures this, flour tortilla wedges covered in cheese, black beans, black olives and tomatoes. I've had them both times and I love them so. Plus, it's huge! 
For my entree, I've had the Honey Chicken pasta and Feta Chicken Pasta. The Feta chicken pasta is full of veggies (peppers, broccoli and onions) and it's light. It's tossed in a garlic herb sauce and served over penne pasta. I really liked the flavor! 
Alexander Micheal's is that cute, casual, grab dinner with the girls or date night spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. That was my first visit and I had the crawfish burrito. What an unusual and delightful dish. My only complaint is that there was no light where we were seated so we couldn't see our meals. My boyfriend had the blackened seafood plate and he loved it. I highly recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood gem just northeast of Uptown's business district. Favorite dish is the \"What It Is\" pasta. Creamy, cheesy, and spicy, and topped with juicy blackened chicken breast. It always seems like they are down a server or two, so it can sometimes be hard to flag someone down, but the waitresses working have always been friendly and the kitchen is usually fast once the order is in. The decor looks like it hasn't been changed in 30 years, which fits well with its function as a neighborhood watering hole. 

I usually walk here from Uptown after work, but parking is somewhat limited if you choose to drive. There is a small lot about half a block away, as well street parking.

Also, get the bread pudding for desert -- it comes out piping hot, moist, and is drenched in a delicious caramel sauce."}
{"text":"Great pub food and atmosphere.  Whether you're looking for lunch in uptown or drinks after work, I strongly recommend giving this place a try.  If only they were a tad larger!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  What a gem of a find, and hunt you must the first time to locate this place.  Walking from uptown up to 9th, you will notice that it becomes very residential and a dead-end, so you may think you are in the wrong place, but you are in the right place.  This is a local tavern, with the charm and hospitality.  Coming here makes you wish you had Alexander Michaels in your neighborhood.  The workers are very welcoming and efficient.  They are quick to take your orders, fill your drinks, and come back often.  The food options are great and too many to choose from.  I wanted to try the pastas as I saw several go by my table, but I went for the daily special, the boneless fried chicken and mashed, and a choice of side, and I was happy.  My friend got the burger and it was tasty too.  Top it all of with a nice selection of local Carolina beers on draft, and you have a great evening.  If I ever get back to Charlotte Al Mike's is on the must return list."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places in uptown. The 4th ward is very special and Alexander Michaels fits right in. We took a Segway tour one night and learned that the building is haunted too. 

The fried pickles are very good and the blackened fish sandwich is delicious. There are a number of local brews on tap and the atmosphere is great. Just a great place to hang. The restaurant can get a little loud but not too bad. It is a cozy location so that is to be expected."}
{"text":"This spot the type of spot I like to picture Anthony Bourdain would visit when exploring Charlotte. Everything about this location screams local Charlotte, from the people who spend their time there, to the workers, to the comfortably understated yet beyond delicious menu and offerings. I highly recommend it as a spot that hasnt hopped on board with the pretentious nature of all lot of the new up and coming locations, while still putting time and effort into the food they serve. The spicy crab soup is an absolute must get, and while I think that you could try anything on this menu and be happy, I truly enjoyed the stroganoff. Thanks for a great experience that warmed me to my core."}
{"text":"We were taken here by a couple of locals (I guess we're locals now too though) on Wednesday night and fun was had.  It's got a busy, friendly vibe and overall satisfying food.

The good: to contradict a previous reviewer, I found the beer selection to be quite respectable.  You've got mainstream goat piss, mainstream Irish, beer snob local, national and international.  I was very pleased by the Gaelic ale from Asheville.  Very pleased.  Also, the nachos were truly a work of art.  I can't stand flour tortillas but flour tortilla chips are great for this mouthwatering mountain of peppers, beans, tomatoes, olives, cream and little chicken bits.

The ok: well, I found my pasta - the Honey Chicken - to be just ok.  The chicken itself was nice and juicy.  I don't know what I expected from the pasta.  I think it was overall a bit sweet, and perhaps a nice pungent feta topping would have broken that up a bit better. What it came with was a bland kind of Parmesan, I think.

I might return and try something else on the menu - like their massive 1/2 pound burgers - and we'll see if it'll make me a fangirl."}
{"text":"Being a native of Charlotte... this is one of my all time favorite place to have lunch or dinner. great place and better staff. This is a true gem for Charlotte!"}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood place in one of Charlotte's nicest neighborhoods....the Fourth Ward.  The food is good.  The service is good.  The setting is GREAT!"}
{"text":"My second time here and not too impressed. 

My Review is positive largely because of the onion rings being so good!!! 

I've ordered pasta here twice and have been disappointed. 

My friend got the fish and looked to be marginally satisfied."}
{"text":"Great vibe, awesome staff. We were in from Iowa for the night and read about the place here. Food was awesome and came fast. Great specialty beers on tap! Test it out, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Chose to eat here based on the reviews however this is probably the first time I didn't agree with the reviews. 

The food was very bland. I had the What IT IS dish and spicy crab soup. The What it is dish was bland, lacked sauce and chicken over cooked. I tried the soup based on the pictures however my soup did not come with extra crab meat on top. It was too thick and just not good

If you are looking for a good Cajun restaurant in a house I suggest trying Cajun Queen it's muuuuccchhhh better."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for business and wanted some good local fair.  Fired up the Yelp and see Alexander Michael's getting awesome scores.  The map says 1.5 miles away and I don't have a car - going to have to hoof it.

Show up about 7:30pm on a Wed.  Place wasn't crowded at all and I got sat right away.  The staff was nice.  I ordered the Fried Pickles as an appetizer.  Some people say they are too salty and I say, \"Well, they're pickles.\"  They get paired up with a cup of ranch, but I think they would have been better with Blue Cheese.  Hint: use just a little ranch on your fried pickle.

Next up was a bowl of Spicy Crab Soup.  This is pretty much an enchilada soup with crab meat in it.  Not that that's a bad thing.  It's good soup.  But spicy?  No.  No it is not.

Main course is the Blackened Catfish Sandwich.  This right here is what I'm talking about.  The filet is a monster.  A tasty, flakey monster.  They pair it up with a tarter sauce (did I detect a pepper in there?  Chipotle maybe?) and some kind of other sauce that was like a chunky salsa/sweet-n-sour thing.  Doesn't matter.  I dumped both of them on.  It was tasty as all get out.  I devoured the enormous sandwich. The side dish I chose was the Broccoli Slaw and honestly, it tasted like 'healthy'.  Skip it.  Do the cajun fries instead."}
{"text":"Okay it's a cool looking building with a nice little history. Other than that why are people peeing their pants for this place?

I admit we only ordered fried pickles (which were good) so perhaps the food is superb. The beer selection was subpar (something I consider vital to have a good bar; either that or really really cheap specials). 

I'm glad I went once. Likely not again."}
{"text":"I really like a place where you can customize your burger and this place had turned that into an art.  There are an infinite number of ways to to get your burger done.  Plus they don't just have burgers, there are a ton of other options that are just as tasty.  They have a very impressive selection of beer too, so if you like adventure in that area give it a go.  It tends to get a little crowded around lunch time with all the bankers and whatnot, but still worth the trip."}
{"text":"Alexander Michaels has become a Charlotte institution.  It has great food and a cozy atmosphere within the heart of Charlotte's oldest neighborhoods."}
{"text":"My partner took me to Alexander Michael's last night for dinner.  When he lived in Uptown, he used to frequent the restaurant often, but it was my first time.  You could say I got my cherry popped.  Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  

Once we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. 

We started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.  

It was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).  The only disappoint is that we weren't able to see the famous pole that they talked about on the back of the menu.  It's located in the women's restroom and apparently it's caused quite a few bruises.  Funny!"}
{"text":"This is a Charlotte gem. The food is fabulous and the owner and staff kick serious ass!!"}
{"text":"Just wow. If you ever come to Charlotte, go to the 4th Ward... its one of the most interesting downtown residential neighborhoods I've ever been in. When you go there, make sure you stop in here for some fantastic people watching and great beers. 

Seriously, walking here transports you completely away from the hustle and bustle and rowdiness of Tryon."}
{"text":"Great food at this little tavern. I had the what it is and I'll tell you what it was...delicious. Nice quiet little spot right near uptown Charlotte. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! Ive been a few times now and every time i go this place is packed but we get there at the right time cause I've never had to wait!! 

If you like wings the Garlic Honey wings are soooo good!! I would definitely recommend to come here they have good beers a good neighborhood feel and of course good food. The servers are very nice and helpful!!"}
{"text":"great location, good food, good atmosphere.

Tucked away in 4th ward, Alexander Michaels is a great restaurant after a walk through the neighborhood.

The restaurant is a little dark, but some good history about the place and a local favorite.

For food: seasonally - the chicken pot pie is great, and everyday - the spicy crab soup is knock your socks off good.

The rest is fine, the selection isn't the best. But overall, A-OK"}
{"text":"I am not one of those people who raves obsessively about Al Mike's but I do think that the place is unique and has a great ambiance. I have not yet tried the London Broil, which I've heard is one of their more popular dishes, but I have had the She-Crab soup and it is very delicious! 

The staff is always very friendly and I love the older wooden benches (They are similar to those of 300 East.) At night, candles are lit and it feels very comfy and cozy inside. I think this would be a good place for a first date but the menu isn't terribly extensive or expensive (if that's what you're going for on a first date...) You can order entrees, as well as salads or appetizers like quesadillas. The bar has a nice beer selection as well. It is located in the heart of 4th ward, snuggled between houses and cobble stone streets, which can make it a little difficult to find but perfect if you live in uptown and can walk to the restaurant while taking in the beautiful houses and scenery along the way.

Full Disclosure: Ladies... if you want the REAL reason to visit Alexander Michaels, here it is.. COOPER. He is one hell of a handsome man that works here. I have seen him a few times while visiting here and he has been extremely helpful and charming each time. I sat at a table facing the door last time I was here and watched every single woman, young and old, swoon over Cooper as he greeted them at the door with a huge, bright smile. I am normally not impressed by the looks of most men but Good Lord help me if he is single. I don't think I could handle it. 

I also hope Cooper does not frequent Yelp.com... 
;)"}
{"text":"From the outside you see a quiet street with some couples strolling along hand-in-hand.  As you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz.  Is that a bar?  What's going on in there?

Once the door is open you are hit with a wave of laughter, glasses clinking, and the sound of people talking.  I think this is going to work out just fine.

The Great:
+ The bartender/host/server/manager/busboy.  This guy was friendly, funny, and helpful.  Quick to smile and full of insight, he is awesome.
+  A great selection of local beers.
+  Cool location and extremely cozy inside.

The Average:
o  The only food we ordered was a crab soup - which was completely average.

With that said, this place would be my local watering hole if I lived in the 4th Ward.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for years and so glad I finally got there. My husband and I arrived around 5 on a Gorgeous Monday afternoon. It was pretty empty, which I welcomed, since it's such a small place and I've heard wait times can be long! It's even smaller and darker than I imagined. I appreciate it for what it is - a great, historic neighborhood pub and restaurant. That being said, I don't think the food is anything too exceptional, but it is good for pub-like food - my 4 stars mostly goes to the atmosphere and experience. 

They have a selection of local beers on tap- there were options from Noda, Sycamore, Triple C, wooden robot and Sugar Creek. Around $5-$6 per pint. We split the jerk chicken quesadillas and the London Broil sandwich, after reading rave reviews. Both were tasty. Definitely add the onions, mushrooms and peppers on the London Broil- otherwise you're doing it wrong. Because it comes coated with a melty Swiss cheese and you want all the substance you can get. Also, get the Cajun fries. 

Oh, and watch out for the pole in the ladies bathroom!"}
{"text":"This is a great old gem in the historic 4th Ward of Uptown. Everything here is great, and the prices are even better! 

I've had the chance to have several menu items here, each being just as good as the last. 

-The London Broil is served with perfectly  cooked/marinated flank stead. Of course to have to get it with the peppers & onions to really make it what it should be. 
-The Ruben is a good size, and the Dijon mustard they thrown on there makes it a little different than what you're used to. It surprised me as I didn't even read the description on the menu when I ordered it. 
-the quinoa veggie black bean burger is superb. This is a must try for everyone who loves any sort of veggie burgers --- it's served on fresh pita bread, wowza!
-crab soup is delicious as a starter for all you seafood lovers out there. 


Bonus: All of their bread is locally sourced from the outstanding Nova's Bakery in Plaza Midwood!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for some time now and we finally decided to check it out last night. 

Upon walking up to the restaurant I was a little afraid this was going to be a locals type place that looks at ya funny when you walk in and don't know what you are doing. This quickly started to escalate as we entered and there was no clear way to know if we were to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. As strange as this may sound I am legit afraid of those situations. I don't want to look like a fool standing around waiting until someone in the know tells me to sit down. Ok- back to my review. 

Just as quickly as my fear rose it went away as a super nice man came out from behind the bar, greeted us with a smile and took us to a table. 

Within a few minutes the waitress appeared with menus and offered some beer suggestions. They have an impressive beer list for a smaller place! 

Both the hubs and myself ordered the London broil sandwich. His with onion rings, mine with fries. We both thought it was outstanding. 

Our waitress was awesome- I wish I could remember her name to give her props, but as I mentioned above, they had a good beer selection! 

Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch this week on a business lunch with two other people. I had never heard of Alexander Michael's until a client recommended it. It is situated in a house just a couple blocks from the heart of Uptown. The environment inside is very pleasant and homey. It has a true neighborhood pub feel. The service was excellent, even during the busy lunch rush. 

I got the london broil sandwich and it was tasty. My coworker highly enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich. My client got the chicken pita which he really liked a lot. He opted for the pasta salad as a side and said it was great.

I want to come back sometime to try out the dinner options!"}
{"text":"Decided on Al Michaels for a late dinner on a Monday. The Yelp reviews are right this place is awesome definitely must try. The food was phenomenal the crab soup, the Jerk quesadillas were out of this world. I had the What it is, Nina had the London broil with cajun Fry's. We took some of everything home but it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"You know that house in college where all your stoner friends lived that had all those tie-dyed sheets up all over the place for \"decor\". Imagine they decided to open a restaurant serving a bunch of beers and expensive food. This is the vibe I get here.

From the bearded bartender who looks like he just woke up, to the \"holy crap it's so dark in here they need to turn on the lights\" vibe, I don't really know what to make of this place.

We decided not to eat at this place due to everything I wrote above, but enjoyed a few beers before moving on.

If you're into beards and eating expensive food in the dark I think you'll really like this place, hippie."}
{"text":"Love this place-definitely one of my favorite places in Charlotte! There's usually a wait but it's well worth it. The honey chicken pasta is to die for!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great  place to stop in for a beer and a good (not fussy or overpriced) bite to eat if you are in or near 4th Ward.  This place is a  Charlotte instititution! I have many fond memories of gathering with friends at Al Mike's throughout the 90's!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and precise. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The food came out as ordered as within a respectable time. With a full restaurant, I was in and out in an hour. My glass never went below half full. Everyone was really on top of their game.

I ordered the fried pickles, teriyaki chicken salad, and black bean burger. The server brought each plate individually when I finished the previous, as if it was a 3-course dinner.

The owner referred to me by my first name every time he spoke to me and made me really feel welcome. I'm not local, but wish I had the opportunity to try every thing else on the menu. I doubt I would ever be disappointed. If I get the opportunity, I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"Very good food. Stroganoff and London Broil were excellent. Loaded baked potato was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Such a shame, could be outstanding but ends up flat. A great location cool old building with great bones. That's where it ends the music was extremely loud for a dinner time setting. The service was terrible we ordered cocktails 5 min before our dinner was ordered and our entrees came out before the drinks did. The Manhattan was average (coming from a former bartender that's being generous). As for the meal, my wife ordered the quesadilla and it was above average. I ordered the London broil which is one of my favorite dishes and was disappointed, the marinade was bland the meat was undercooked and cut incorrectly.   Overall we would not return which is a shame because we are in this area often for shows at the music factory."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the outskirts of uptown/downtown Charlotte sits the cute and quaint Alexander Michael's. While my best friend and his boyfriend were in town for the holidays, we decided to stop in here for a bite to eat.  It was after 1 PM & surprisingly, the place was still packed.  This isn't saying much, because the tavern is quite small. Luckily, there were some empty seats at the bar.

They have a pretty extensive lunch menu & everything sounds good! I had a hard time choosing, but I went with the burger & cajun fries. (My second choice was the grilled cheese - maybe next time!)

We didn't wait too long until our food arrived. Holy cow (pun intended), this burger was HUGE! There were plenty of fries, too!  The burger was so tasty. It was just the right amount of juicy, without said juicy running down your wrists & arms. The bun from local Nova's Bakery was a fantastic addition. Word of caution: you will have to cut this burger in half!  Needless to say I finished my entire burger...it was only right! I wasn't able to finish the fries, but they were hot & crispy & the cajun seasoning had just enough \"bite\"...it wasn't overpowering.

The staff was so friendly & chatted frequently with us. They always made sure our glasses were filled & that we were enjoying our food. 

The prices are a bit pricey, but in my case, the portion equaled the price ($9).

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My coworker insisted on driving me here for lunch instead of just walking to a restaurant near South Tryon. So there must be something special about it.  

Alexander Michael's is a nice little bar/ restaurant located at the outskirt of Fourth Ward Uptown in the middle of a residential neighborhood. The set up was classy, and to my amusement I ended up having a candle-lit lunch with my macho coworker

For lunch we both ordered a Reuben sandwich with cajun seasoned fries. The sandwiches were relatively smaller than other restaurants, but they were steaming hot with dijon mustard and were absolutely delicious! As for the fries, you can smell the cajun seasoning from far away which is absolutely mouth watering!

I for sure will be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Using the overused term \"hidden gem\" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. 

HINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. 

Sat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. 

Service is so friendly here. You really get the feeling that these people have been at it for a long time and keep it old school. 

If you haven't been or are on the fence, I highly recommend. Definitely one of the Uptown staples."}
{"text":"This place is a charlotte classic, my husband and I are clt natives and I had never been till recently it's one of his very favorites. It wasnt bad but I don't get the hype. It was overpriced bar food to me. Beer selection wasn't anything magical and I got beef tips and a baked potato and it wasn't any better than any chilis, outback (insert standard chain). Not saying I won't be back because their location is great but not my absolute favorite"}
{"text":"Tried the bread pudding this weekend...PHENOMENAL!!!  Its a hot, sweet, gooey, cinnamon-flavored bread covered with caramel and two heaping dollops of whip cream.  Its a large portion, so be sure to leave room or invite a friend (preferably ME!!!)."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for the local favorites (a grateful thank you to Katie from the Mint Museum Uptown for the recommendation). I have to say that the reviews for this wonderful local American pub are not misleading.

Dark old school interior with lots of bead-board wainscoting, a tin ceiling, and a variety of vintage print material adorning the walls, the place is comfortable and inviting. The place was full and bustling on this particular Tuesday night (despite being past the dinner hour). The host (who I think has been tagged as \"Ken\" in an earlier review was friendly and found me a table for one immediately (a great corner booth that gives a good view of the establishment) and my waitress, Traci, was flawless. Clearly a neighborhood haunt, a wide variety of clientele were enjoying the evening making for some pleasant people watching.

I really enjoyed my time at AM's, but I must confess that the food was good, but not great. The spicy crab soup was tasty, but not nearly spicy enough, and the 4th Ward Beef Stroganoff had a nice traditional flavor, but the sauce was too thin to stick to the meat or rotini or my ribs.

My personal business travel rules discourage me from eating at the same place twice, but if I were in need of a good comfort food meal in a place with some good energy, Alexander Michael's would be on my short list."}
{"text":"One of our favorite cozy places to eat in Uptown.  Dark and cozy booths, good food, great drinks. Lots of fun memories."}
{"text":"Traveling for work I make food stops throughout the northeast and southeast corridors, but whenever I get even slightly close to uptown Charlotte again I gather up friends and head to this place.  It feels a little like a pub, cozy but still very family friendly.  There is a nice bar plus tables and booths for a choice of seating.  It's fun, it doesn't get super loud and you can still hear and talk easily with each other at the table, which is part of the attraction too.  

As for the food - everything we've tried has been to die for.  Last week we all ordered something different for tasting - Burgers, chicken, tuna plate with their special broccoli slaw, and the spicy crab soup!!!  Only shared a tiny bit of my soup, but it was enough for the taster to decide to order his own lol.  Have always loved Charleston she crab soup, but have come to love AM's even more.  Service is spot on - the local community is beautiful and great for a walk after your meal.  Definitely a place to put on your list if ever in the area."}
{"text":"On Thursday, Aug. 18th, I had the pleasure of visiting Alexander Michael's for dinner.  This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.

My date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  

My date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  

I am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Good fried pickles. Good Chocolate Martini. When I moved to Charlotte someone took me here and then I didn't know anywhere else to go yet, so I would go here quite a lot - even took my visiting family here. It's a good bar, joint, eatery, but after I found more stuff, I never returned... not sure why..

I do have fond memories of the chocolate martini..."}
{"text":"Love love loved this place! We are new to Charlotte and wanted to go out for a date night and a friend recommended Al Mikes to us! The atmosphere, food, and service was impeccable. Will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place. When I was touring the 4th ward, a resident came out of his apartment and recommended \"Al Mike's.\" Then another stranger walking down the sidewalk confirmed it was \"really good.\" After unsolicited recommendations from two strangers, my fiance and I decided we couldn't not go. I love that it's truly a neighborhood pub - no parking lot surrounding it. The buffalo chicken sandwich and the cajun fries. The food and the beer selection are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Just had the London Broil Sandwich. Came in looking for a French dip but was convinced this was the way to go. The London Broil was loaded with meat, and really sweet onions and covered in cheese. Definitely satisfied the craving and did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This long standing restaurant has been in the qc many many years and this is only my 2nd visit.  I remember my first visit being just ok but the 4.5 star rating made me curious enough to return.  They are located on a dead end street off of Graham.  It's very dimly lit inside and the bar area is pretty large with lots of tv's.  The staff was really nice and are very familiar with the menu to offer recommendations if needed. 

The food is still the same..........average......they have many pasta dishes, wings, salads, sandwiches, etc.  I had the crab soup, which for the first time of me having tried this soup at many other restaurants, this restaurant had imitation crab in the soup....no words.  I also ordered the 'what it is' pasta dish, which was very dry blackened chicken over cajun cream sauced rotini(and it's not fresh as the menu states)......so I would like to rename it 'what it was' which was definitely not worth $17."}
{"text":"The waitress was super cute and put a cinnamon sugar rim on my pumpkin beer even though that's not something they typically do. 

I tried the Feta Chicken Pasta for the first time and it was blah.  However, this is still one of my favorite places.  The Spicy Crab Soup is amazing.."}
{"text":"4 stars for atmosphere. 2 stars for food and service and that's being generous. I was really disappointed because i was hoping for some great food. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Update to my first review:

I could not have been happier with my first time to Al Mike's. The second time in less than a month, was a totally different experience. My dad came into town and I had talked this place up as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. It wasn't even close. Our waitress was less than thrilled to be serving us. She spoke in short rushed sentences and took what felt like a lifetime to take our order. Apparently, her approach is to carry just one dish at a time from the kitchen to the table. She's also a pro at ignoring a table that has its menus closed and has been that way 10 minutes. She just seemed annoyed to be there. I chalked this up to her just having an off night. 

My dad was seated facing the kitchen and witnessed pure filthiness. Someone with gloves on in the kitchen handled money from the waitress, and then passed her a tray full of food to be served without taking off or changing the gloves. Revolting and unsanitary.

Our meals were very underwhelming as well. I got the What It Is, my dad got the Penne Athena, and my girlfriend got a build your own pasta. Mine was alright, the sauce tasted like pure butter and not much else. The build your own pasta seemed to be fine. The Penne Athena was a disgrace. The \"sauce\" was beyond watery and the overall flavor was lacking. I could not have been more disappointed this time around, and will probably not be back for quite a while if at all."}
{"text":"I can't understand where these sub-4 star reviews come from but they obviously did not appreciate the beauty of the food served at AL Mike's. Done to perfection and seasoned perfectly our entire group really enjoyed the experience. It is sometimes crowded and noisey but IT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR people. It is a wonderful experience on all levels."}
{"text":"I mentioned in an earlier review that I used to live in Charlotte.  When my ex and I started dating in 1985, he lived within walking distance.  We were there at least 3 nights a week and the only way I was able to pay off my Visa bill was to move.  They've always had a great drink selection and although I no longer eat beef, the burgers were the bomb.  On my most recent visit I was happily greeted by Steve, a mainstay who still remembered me.  I also revisited the fried pickles.  Lightly fried, but enough to remind me that I probably needed to have only this one helping.  The atmosphere is friendly and service fantastic.  Such a comfortable and comforting place.  This is my go-to spot anytime I am in uptown/downtown/anywhere in CLT."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to treat guests in Charlotte. Feels like a home. The owner (I believe) has been the host every time I went. Wait can be a bit long on weekends, but it's worth it and you can try one of their many beers on draft while you wait. It's great because you can spend just $10 on a delicious sandwich & fries or treat yourself to a wonderful dinner entree. Dad's a picky eater, but loved their pasta. Don't skip on the Cajun fries!!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the spiced she crab soup and the \"What It Is\". Will come back next time I'm in town. Pleasant waitress and prompt service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall..bumped up to a 4 for being...\"cozy\".. as one of my friends put it.  Solid food and a good place to start out a night.  A good way to get away from all the new and experience something with true Charlotte style."}
{"text":"Bored at night at the Double Tree near the bus station in Charlotte I needed a better place to hang out.  Tired of hotel bars and expensive consultant watering pools I found myself looking for a out of the way neighborhood bar.

Enter a young woman I met on a flight from BWI to CLT.  She told me about a cool neighborhood bar with 10 minutes of the hotel.  I sat on this information for  two weeks until last evening when I gave in and took a walk. 

Located in some cool neighborhood that I have no idea where in Charlotte is a really great bar with a very laid back atmosphere and genuine customers.  

You enter the establishment and it takes you back to those old European bars in Amsterdam.  Dark, unassuming and quaint.  Service was top notch, and the food was excellent.  I have the Vegetarian Burger on Texas Toast with onions and tomato.  Pretty good in my book.  Done just right.  I topped it off with 2 Amstel Lights and some good conversation.  

I need to find more places like this.  The great thing about A.M is it is not that easy to find.  And in this busy world we all live in t A.M is the place I want to be.

Thanks Airtran girl, much appreicated!

{"text":"I love this place.  It has a great atmosphere.  It's a small place in the middle of a neighborhood.  It's just a few block from the center of downtown Charlotte.  The nachos are the best I've ever had.  I've never had a bad meal.  They also have a really good draft beer selection.  If you haven't been here, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Great place tucked away in 4th ward. You'd never know it was there. Only caveat is that parking is near-impossible. Strict street parking rules make it tough to come here if you're driving. 

London broil Sandwhich was clutch. Good ambiance as well. 

Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Al Mike's is my shit.  Want to a good place for a first date? Check.  Want Triple C babymaker in pints? Check?  Want awesome food at a great price?  Chickity friggin check. l Mike's is located in a really awesome part of the fourth ward.  Tree lined streeets and amazing houses.  Al Mike's itself looks like an awesome house turned into a restaurant.  When you walk in, you kind of feel like its an irish pub from the 80's, but this character is what makes it cozy and awesome.  The kitchen is the size of a shoe box and I don't understand how they turn out such great food as quick as they do.  It must be some type of wizardry. They have a semi cajun menu and cajun fries are always a good side dish.  Their crab soup is out of control.  Things to get here are the pasta dishes, the chicken dish, and for a sandwich the London Broil ( medium rare of course!).  This is my ace in the hole whenever I have no idea what I want. I love you Al Mike's!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! I had the build your own pasta and it was delicious. Quaint restaurant. The neighborhood cats are quiet entertaining while waiting to be seated/served."}
{"text":"Live across the st quite literally.  Great neighborhood place with standard predictable pub fare.  Quite busy during lunch which is surprising since it is a bit more of a walk than other Uptown restaurants.  Service was prompt, can't go wrong with a burger, salad, or any of the sides."}
{"text":"Some folks in Charlotte will never get the pleasure of experiencing this great little spot unless they yelp it lol. It's nestled away in the 4th Ward area of uptown. Like much of uptown neighborhood restaurants, this home-turned-pub eatery has a great charm to it. The atmosphere is casual, the lighting is soft. A great place to go for dinner. Staff is very friendly and food is great. They have a creamy, Cajun chicken pasta that is top notch. It's called; \"What it is\". Definitely a keeper on my list."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out as it has been on my list of places I wanted to try due to the great reviews. Horrible service. The waitress was not friendly at all. We let her know it was our 1st time visiting and she didn't make any suggestions or respond in any way. My friend asked if they had Moscato which they didn't have and the waitress did not bother to offer up an alternative. I ordered the daily special which was a chicken pasta dish and I was not impressed. It lacked flavor. I won't be returning or suggesting this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a month because it is such a short walk.  Before moving to uptown I had no idea this place existed.  Its exactly the type of place I'd spend a weeknight eating and drinking with friends in a relaxes atmosphere without getting beer spilled on me (as is inevitable at any other bar in uptown).  

I'd recommend the burgers, any flavor of wings, or the London broil (sandwich too).  These are my favorites.  I really need to start exploring the menu some more."}
{"text":"Was taking the famous Fourth Ward Secret Gardens Tour on this beautiful Sunday....which was awesone by the way. Saw that Alexander Michaels was open for this event. Was immediately greeted by Cooper, the host and owner's son. And yes ladies he is a \"hunk.\" And a hell of a nice guy too! I shared some of the other female Yelp reviews with him and he laughed.

Due to the other Yelp reviews I started with the fried pickles. Theirs were very lightly battered so you can actually TASTE the pickles! I thought that was great, along with the standard Ranch dipping sauce.

Cooper recommended the Penne Athena which was a nice, light chicken dish with black olives, red peppers and a light mushroom cream sauce. Very tasty and indeed not too heavy following my walkibg tour. 

Overall very good! Cooper, Milt at the bar were super gracious and friendly hosts! Can't wait to come back to try their 4th Ward Stroganoff."}
{"text":"Great palce for a pint a best bar food you will be able to find... they have great friend pickels and there steak sandwhich is pretty awesome... the place is kinda hard to find since it is in a house in a neighborhood and the line can be crazy long... but the food is worth it... go with a few friends and relaize that you will be there for a few hours... take you time and drinks some beers"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here.  I started with the yummy fried pickles!  This is a must try because the are the fried pickles I measure all fried pickles by.  I have not been here in 15 years and they are still remarkable.  In most of the Yelp reviews of AM, the crab soup was highly recommend and praised. It did not disappoint.  Is was creamy and full bodied with lost of crab meat.  I can not wait to come back for more of this great food!  This is a warm and cozy place to dine and they have a nice bar."}
{"text":"I have not been to Alexander Michaels in over 10 years and the food and service is still exceptional. Laid back atmosphere located in a beautiful neighborhood in Uptown. Definitely will be back. Won't wait ten years."}
{"text":"I brought my sister from out of town after a recommendation from my daughter. This is truly a beautiful location !  We had great service from the bartender and the open faced turkey sandwich was great!  It was very relaxing atmosphere and after just walking the neighborhood was a highlight"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best bars in Charlotte. Tucked away in a small side street in 4th ward, Alexander Michael's is the quintessential neighborhood bar.  Good solid, good drinks, and great company."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The area it's located is so quaint. Victorian houses everywhere. I work uptown, so I walked to the restaurant because it was only five minutes away (walking distance.) Our server was amazing, I forgot her name, but she was great. When I looked at the food pics on yelp, I noticed the catfish sandwich and was looking for it on the menu, however, it wasn't there. So I asked the server and she said it's usually only on Fridays, but can ask if they can make it for me, which they were able to so that made me excited. We ordered that and the Black Quinoa burger and told the server we are going to split both of them. When she brings the food to us, she had them cut each sandwich in half and give us separate plates for each sandwich with the sides. BEST SERVICE EVER.  Both sandwiches were absolutely delicious and the Cajun fries were great. I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back. Thank you for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Loooonnnng overdue review of this neighborhood icon.  We're lucky enough to live a block from Al Mike's and love everything about this little neighborhood gem.  The quality is reliable and on point, and you can't beat the genuine corner pub vibe.  You can't replicate that authenticity with a chain joint or strip mall bar/restaurant.  Al Mike's is the real deal and should be on everyone's gastro bucket list, whether you live here, or are just visiting.  One of the best!"}
{"text":"We first stopped in here on a whim, on the way home from an event. We like to try new places and we were very pleasantly surprised by this gem. It's got a great ambience, a delicious menu and great staff. If there is a downside to the place, it's that there can be really long waits for dinner. Also, parking can be a challenge, but that' sang issue for the entire 4th ward. Other than that, they have a great selection of beers, and a delicious and varied menu. I highly recommend Alexander Michaels..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Uptown. My go to dishes are the London broil entree and the what it is. Tried out most of the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The daily specials are usually pretty great as well."}
{"text":"I'm going to be the odd person and not give this place a glowing review.

First off, the atmosphere is actually cool.  This is a true pub.  Beautiful dark wood is everywhere.  The staff is also very nice, no complaint there.

The thing is, I don't really have a complaint, I'm just not impressed with the food.  I find it acceptable, but nothing special.  In fact, the menu is, to me, kinda boring.  I think the point of this place is more to go \"have a few\" after work and such.  When looking for great food in uptown, this place wouldn't make my list.  I do love that it's locally owned and operated, however, and harbor no ill feelings."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant. Alexander Michaels, also know to locals as Al Mikes, has so much charm! It's tucked back in 4th ward and appears to fit right within the neighborhood- it looks like a quaint house from the outside. And from what I've heard, it use to be an old grocery store! The decor is old school- wood paneling, throwback signs, but the food is delicious! 


IMO, AL's has one of the best veggie burgers in Charlotte! This is a must try item, even if you're a meat lover. The veggie burger isn't served on a bun, but rather than pita bread. It's a quinoa bean burger and it's just fricken delicious, especially because it's topped with avocado!   

Another must try are their fried pickles with ranch. I mean is there anything to question with this recommendation? NO. Order them- love them- and come back again!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service, plain and simple. 

I came here alone one night for dinner, and as a solo diner, I really just want something tasty that won't take forever. This place was perfect. It's got an atmospheric dimly candle-lit tavern setting, no unrealistically chipper smiles, no needless conversation. Just efficient servers who get you what you need. I loved it!

As for the food, I ordered the Cajun catfish sandwich and a cup of soup. The sandwich came with a remoulade which was good, but also with a tangy pickle jammy type sauce that I thought really pulled the dish together. I had a cup of crab soup as well- it was rich and hearty. 

I left here satisfied, and was impressed even more by the value. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is honey chicken.  One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  I'm not from Charlotte, but make it a point to eat it everytime I visit.  Locals living near the restaraunt know it by name.  I've heard the other food is also great, but I can't get off the honey chicken.  The staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Visited this place last week, and was fairly disappointed. Very small seating area, and the food was mediocre. I had their Greek salad and spicy crab soup. The crab in the soup was clearly imitation. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Only positive about this place is that it's fairly affordable during lunch hours. Don't plan on ever going back!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The \"What it is\" pasta dish is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Every time i have lunch at Alexander Michaels it is wonderful. I recommend this hidden gem to my coworkers in the music factory. I highly recommend you stop in for a meal and ice cold beer. Parking can be a little tough"}
{"text":"Outstanding place for great food and lovely pub atmosphere...first time there this past Friday and I could have just stopped with the crab soup.  DELICIOUS!  Great prices and just a wonderful experience before a concert at The Underground. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in Charlotte. The atmosphere and service are outstanding. Al Mike's is my first recommendation anytime someone asks where to eat. My only request.. Bring back Octoberfeast! Fried pickles are the best in town!"}
{"text":"We really liked the pub feel of this place and the location hidden among the houses. It could be easy to miss if you didn't know it was there. The inside didn't feel like a house at all, it was pretty dark inside, yet light enough to read the menu and socialize. The service was great, prompt refills, although we did wait an extended period of time to get our check. 
i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and Cajun fries. Wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken. i guess i prefer more sauce and flavor. It seemed like too much chicken and bun, with not enough flavor. i liked the Cajun fries for my side and they were a generously sized portion.

We also tried the nachos. My special lady friend gave them a thumbs up. They were flour tortilla chips which seemed odd at first, but in the end seemed like a good choice. 

i'd like to go back another time when i can enjoy some drinks and try another menu selection."}
{"text":"Good food. The Cajun fries were great and the Caribbean jerk quesadilla was awesome. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was just okay... Was not very spicy and I wish it had cheese on it. They didn't have enough menus for everyone but the service was great and the atmosphere was nice. Great food my friends loved the Ruben I just didn't make the best pick."}
{"text":"Came here today after a recommendation at the hotel I was staying. I must have come on an off day. The spicy crab soup was just ok, warm, not hot. Fried chicken with gravy and mashed potatoes was pretty good, but they had run out of mashed potatoes and so they gave me garlic mashed which didn't taste right with the chicken and gravy on top. Service was average at best...and my waitress was almost mean. Perhaps this place is just for locals."}
{"text":"Hate to ditto what others have said, but it's true, the service was absolutely amazing for a Friday evening dinner out. They don't do reservations, but that lets them show their attentiveness, wish places that do take reservations were as efficient and thoughtful. The atmosphere is very cozy and charming. The only drawback is parking can be a challenge, so you may need to walk, but I got lucky and was able to park almost out front, so you may get lucky too! The big tip I'd give is the crab soup, that stuff is like liquid gold, really good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was inviting, and the food was good. We had the nacho appetizer which was big enough for both of us. The black beans with all the salad yummies could have been a meal in itself. No room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I wish the GPS had been right about the derelict building it had initially brought me to....I would have been happily on my way to a satisfying meal elsewhere.....perhaps a place that doesn't have two legal parking places in a 5 block radius ....one of which is occupied by the restaurants mascot. An old beat up pick up truck....which seems to have avoided citation for 20 years. 

 When this gem was recommended to me as a fantastic \"seasonal\" restaurant, I wanted to call them immediately and ask them what season we were in that served these nasty, cold, ..
Oh but \"smoked\"quesadillas .  or perhaps when a good time of the year it was to enjoy this warm on the outside...cold on the inside tuna melt.  The waitress seemed shocked that one could possibly eat it any other way.   

 About 2/3 through the meal, we were asked to settle up...because at that time of day... Something with their computers demanded them to stop all service... And start a new tab.

 

 Nothing special on this menu.... Overrated pub grub."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places in Charlotte.  It has a very chill atmosphere and the food is great.  This is a great first date spot."}
{"text":"Neat place in the historic area of downtown Charlotte.  Walkable to all the tall buildings but feels like you are in a neighborhood.  Looks like an old-fashioned store with a tin roof.

More of a pub than anything.  Don't look to be knocked out by the food.  But it's good.  Had a half turkey sandwich with gumbo for lunch.

The bar is really cool though.  Good selection of beers including two highland beers from Asheville and other craft beers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant/ bar. Off the beaten path in 4th Ward. Food is always consistently very good. Service is excellent. Despite disclaimers on their website about not taking reservations, I've never had to wait."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, service was good, menu was limited, BUT the Cheese Cake was incredible, the desert is what pushed my review to 4 stars.

However, the \"What it's All About\" chicken was very good.  I was disappointed I couldn't substitute for the potatoes, bummer."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Al Mikes. Loved the location. Tucked away in the beautiful 4th Ward neighborhood. The restaurant was quaint and lovely. The bartender Paul was very nice and helpful. I ordered the stroganoff and it was awesome. Best meal I've had in a while. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Went early on a Saturday night after a matinee at Belk Theater. Found a parking spot on the street very close to the restaurant. I imagine this doesn't happen as easily during normal dinner time. The restaurant is in a residential neighborhood. After a short wait we were seated. The historic building gives the vibe of a friendly, cozy neighborhood bar. We had the specials and shared them between the two of us:  Bruschetta salad w chicken and Shrimp Alfredo pasta. Both were delicious. The longer we were there the busier it got and the service slowed considerably. I noticed when we arrived and when we left there were open tables, but lots of people waiting to be seated. It took forever to get our bill, so maybe that's where things break down in turning tables. Good food, friendly but slow service."}
{"text":"My family and I were in Charlotte, North Carolina and decided to stop here because of Yelp. As it turns out this was the best restaurant wr have been to in a while. Quality food, large portions, relatively fast seating, and great service."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little spot. A true hidden treasure! So much history in 4th ward and this restaurant just adds to it. The food is delicious and comes out super quick. I would recommend this place to anyone!! We will surely be back. The service is great too!!!"}
{"text":"For sure one needs to order the potato appetizer food just served beef stroganoff and blackened chicken"}
{"text":"Top five favorite places in Charlotte. I got the potato wedges to start. The potato is big enough for a group of people and it's very filling. For my entree, I got the \"what it is\". I am not a fan of cream sauce, but their Cajun cream sauce is so good. The blackened chicken is a great compliment. They have a solid list of local beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"Quaint, atmosphere and great food to boot. If you want to break from the norm, start here!"}
{"text":"It's always great to find a place that seems that it just stopped in time and the rest of the world moved on. Alexander and Michaels is one of those places. It's in the middle of a beautiful Victorian Era neighborhood in  what used to be a general store. The inside gives the same impression, with its dark aged wood all around and old decor. The staff was very helpful and friendly from the minute we walked in the door. There's is a good selection of beers on tap but I was happy to see that they had Franziskaner, a classic hefeweizen, perfect to quench my thirst from the scorching heat that day. Had the London broil and Cajun fries for dinner. The cut is from flank steak so it can be a bit tough but the seasoning and flavors made up for the extra chewing. The Cajun fries were the right choice to compliment the meat, not too salty or spicy. In conclusion, it was a good experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Super cozy inside, food is something like mom would make. Great selection of local beers. 

Fried pickles from here are a must! 

Service is alway friendly, go there a few times and they will know you by name. 

If you haven't tried it yet, this Charlotte landmark is a must!"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood spot. Solid food - pasta and sandwiches. Diverse menu. Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Cute little spot. I live just a few blocks down the street and have never even passed this place- \"hidden gem\" seems to be the term of choice for Alexander Michael's. Not only am I in love with the little parks and the historic Fourth Ward homes, but I really adore places with character- and Alexander Michael's has just that.

Alexander Michael's is dimly lit, very old and bar-looking. We were seated right away but the restaurant soon had a big wait at the door. I can see this is a neighborhood favorite. I'm currently in the \"I dine out too much and cook huge portions / eat as much as I feed my boyfriend\" stage, so I opted against an appetizer and went straight for the blackened catfish. He got the crawfish burrito, which is funny because we noticed that we see cajun/creole EVERYWHERE since our recent New Orleans trip. I swear, I didn't notice anything cajun or creole before NOLA, which is a shame because I adore it so much. Anyway, I tried the burrito (yum) and enjoyed my catfish with sautéed vegetables. I'm being healthyish, you know. I'm sure we'll take a stroll back soon."}
{"text":"I'm with one reviewer from a few days ago. 4 1/2 stars, I don't think so.

Great location and good vibe. Interior was very cool.

Waitress and service was good.

Decent local beer selection on tap.

Crab soup was good but we only had a sample as we ordered fried pickled. That was a mistake as the pickles were nothing special.

Daughter had only fries which were below average.

Wife had meatloaf special which was only ok.

I had blackened catfish sandwich. Came on a bun that was 3 dense inches thick. I only ate the top and that was more than enough. 
  
Other than the location and atmosphere I would not go out of my way for the food."}
{"text":"Cool, cozy spot in the 4th ward. Parking was a little difficult but their website gives enough info on where to park and where not to park. Very sex dimly lit bar, great for casual dates. Food was wholesome and filling though not extremely exciting. That's okay in my mind since it is a neighborhood restaurant that is really there to keep its community full, not rob their wallets. I'd go again for a beer and a burger."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I feel like it is a hidden gem to most. This was the first place I ate out at when I moved to Charlotte about 3 years ago and is now a favorite date night for my boyfriend and I. Especially for dinner in the Fall, because it is the perfect season for their spicy crab soup - YUM. I usually go for either a pasta dish or a salad and have loved everything I have ordered here. Last time I got the cajun chicken pasta, delish! Such a great atmosphere hidden in uptown."}
{"text":"This is a very cute neighborhood joint but the food left a lot to be desired, especially given the price.

I ordered the chicken marsala, and while the serving size was huge, the pasta itself wasn't very good. It was under-seasoned and didn't really have that marsala taste, it mostly tasted like cream and cheese. The chicken was also overcooked. 

However, my SO had the What Is It pasta, which he loved. So it seems the dishes are hit or miss here."}
{"text":"I love Al Mike's. The restaurant is hidden in the beautiful First Ward neighborhood. They've got great food, a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere. I typically get the blue cheese burger, while my boyfriend loves to get the London broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard. The fries and onion rings are delicious too. Plus, it's non-smoking, which I LOVE. I just wish it stayed open later."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for a while because there is a lot to say about this place. First off, this is not your typical restaurant or \"watering hole\" which is what I love! Tucked away in 4th ward you may unfortunately overlook this hidden gem. It is a historic home turned into a lovely and quaint restaurant. The ambiance is something you will not find in other uptown Charlotte restaurants. The food has always been top notch, along with the service. I've dined (and drank at the bar) many times and everytime I leave I know it won't be long before I'll be back :) On a side note...definitely try the \"what it is\" pasta dish! Truthfully, all of the food I've had has been extremely tasty. They even offer daily food specials that usually aren't on the menu. You definitely can't go wrong by coming to this place!"}
{"text":"What a terrific local restaurant, tavern, local brews!  I had the Copper (amber) beer and pasta!  Good food reasonable prices nice ambience!

Special thanks to Kaylor, the bartender for her hospitality!"}
{"text":"This historic neighborhood restaurant boast a great atmosphere - large windows in the front of the joint let in a lot of natural light during the day and a bar with tv's that stretch along the length of the restaurant. It's a great spot to grab a drink with some friends and have a few appetizers. At night the restaurant is darker - due to the dark wood interiors and dinner light. It's cozy feeling. 

I've been twice now, however, and both times I felt let down by the food. The food was mediocre. I had a chicken dish the first time and the second time a quesadilla because quite frankly I couldn't find anything else on the menu that was speaking to me. Maybe I ordered wrong both times?

If you are in the mood for bar food (appetizers), drinks and a great atmosphere -- come here. It will meet your needs and you will not be disappointed. 

I'm sure we'll make it back here at some point - at that time I'll have to edit my review - hopefully I just ordered wrong!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a hundred year old building that was originally a General Store in the quaint 4th Ward neighborhood, this is what I call a destination restaurant.  You definitely would never just stumble upon it.  It was opened in 1983 by two Charlotte attorneys (A. Michael Troiano Jr & Alexander Copeland III), hence the name Alexander Michael's.  Great beer selection, friendly staff, fried pickles, tavern atmosphere.  WHAT IT IS and the BEEF STROGANOFF don't suck.  Dark, cozy and just a fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I've only ate here one time at lunch and quite enjoyed it.  This is one of those places that you'd never find unless one, you find it on the infamous Yelp!, or two, someone took you here because they knew about it --mine was the latter.  The location is buried in a residential area of uptown Charlotte right off the beaten track --which really gives it a unique feel.

The insides kind of had the feeling of a snug, English style pub.  It was quite small and the tables were pushed relatively close together.  Its overall appearance was pretty clean despite its dark look and feel.

The food was pretty good.  I got their club sandwich with fries and my kids got the grilled cheese --which looked and tasted great!  The club sandwich was alright, using just regular deli meat and cheese on thick toasted bread.

The staff at this place were great.  They were very friendly and polite and pretty efficient, too.  The only downside to this place was I thought it was pretty expensive for what you got."}
{"text":"I'm so tired of chains & the restaurants that have no uniqueness.  My family went for lunch at this gem this Afternoon and were happily surprised.  Feels like an old historic home where you are greeted right away with friendly servers.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes from a three cheese grilled cheese on texas toast to tuna melts to a quiona veggie burger.  Service, food and atmosphere made an enjoyable afternoon!"}
{"text":"The spicy crab soup and the chicken leek  soup were delicious and I suspect homemade. The Ruben washed down with the Mecktoberfest beer was a good combo.  Very good lunch and would come back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"We had one night to go out to dinner during our recent Charlotte visit, and Al Mike's is where my friend wanted to take us.  Of course, I had to look up the reviews on Yelp before I agreed, and once I did, I was sold.  

And now that I've been, I must say, Charlotte Yelpers, you are right on with this one!

I love this incredibly charming historic restaurant and the 4th Ward neighborhood that surrounds it.  AM's atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Luckily, we arrived early on Saturday night (around 6:30), so we didn't have to wait for a table... (The restaurant did, however, fill up within a half hour).

The highlights in my eyes:
*great beer selection!
*fried pickles! 
*burger
*onion rings

It was my first time ever trying fried pickles, and I'm a fan!  We devoured them as an appetizer for the table.  

We weren't huge fans of the crab soup, and I'd stay away from salads... they are nothing special.

The service was attentive with a snap of attitude.  I think they probably are friendlier toward their regulars, but that's fine by me.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular too!"}
{"text":"Alexander Michael's oozes charm. A charm that you can't find in most Charlotte pubs and restaurants. If this place were dropped in the middle of London, it would fit right in -- although the menu would need some tweaks. I was with a group of four so we split a number of dishes and I got to taste the chicken wings, spicy crab soup, burger and blackened catfish. The wings were fine, nothing to rave about, the spicy crab soup wasn't spicy and needed a few extra dashes of sherry, the burger was solid and delicious, and the blackened catfish would make any southern fisherman happy. Not surprisingly they have a solid beer menu and the staff was attentive and friendly despite the huge crowds. If I'm ever back in this area, I'll be sure to drop by for a drink or quick snack."}
{"text":"Big fan of Al Mike's. Great, friendly staff and great, cozy atmosphere. There's often neighborhood locals at the bar that are happy to talk to you. We actually started a conversation with a girl sitting at the bar that ended up joining us for dinner. 

We were there on a Monday night and the special was meatloaf. I'm not overly fond of meatloaf, and would usually not order it in a restaurant, but for whatever reason decided to go for it. I'm glad I did as it was amazing. 

I had a slice of carrot cake for desert that was also very good. All in all, it was a great meal with friends. It's worth mentioning again how friendly and helpful the staff was, which genuinely helps to make the Alexander Michael's experience. Al Mike's is what a neighborhood pub should be."}
{"text":"A Mikes, wow! After being a little unimpressed with my choice of poplar for pre dinner drinks, my hubs was pleasantly surprised by the laid back vibes in A Mikes. Our server was sweet and engaging. We ordered drinks and wings for appetizer. They were very tasty and smoking hot! Hubs ordered a pasta dish with chicken and bacon which he loved and I ordered the London broil with Cajun fries and it was amazing! Well done A Mikes, we will be back!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in you immediately feel like your in an old world tavern and eveyone in town is there.  Despite the number of people, Susie still managed to deliver great service.  The catfish was perfect and full of flavor.  I also highly recommend the spicy crab soup.  I'm so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for a business trip and found this gem thanks to Yelp. And after a wonderful first visit, I found it a few more times that week. A bit of a divey atmosphere in a great little historic neighborhood. Food is phenomenal, I got the daily special each time just to have some variety. I wasn't disappointed any time I was there, and neither was anyone else we were with. The place gets pretty crowded around lunch so I recommend staying away right at noon - aim for 11:30 or after 1."}
{"text":"Great spot in an unexpected neighborhood. I agree with the other reviews - wish my neighborhood bars were like just this one. The bisque was great, and service was attentive (even with the place being super-busy). Definitely a return candidate!"}
{"text":"Cool and busy restaurant. A locals favorite; a true neighborhood gathering place / pub. Beautiful building. Good drinks selection. Good food. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"This was bar food heaven. Looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. 

Waiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \"What It Is\". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"Cool place. Sort of hard to find.  The food was good and the ambiance was what really drew us in.  Easy access to music city.  We had a quick dinner before a show."}
{"text":"Just got back from there. Busy for a Monday night, speaks to the great food and good service! The crab soup was sensational, best ever. Meatloaf was excellent as was chicken broccoli casserole, both were the specials tonight. Good selection of beers, I don;t care about wine! Plenty of local craft beers. Great service. Noisy and packed by the time we left, deservedly full of people, this place is a gem. Eat here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Alexander Mike's but picked it based of previous reviews =) and because it is not far from the Fillmore music venue. When we arrived, at about 5:30, it was still very quiet but began filling up fast (including other tables obviously going to the Carbon Leaf/Big Head Todd and the Monsters concert.) As soon as we walked in a server approached and guided us to a booth. 

Food: We started with the Crab meat Supreme Quesadilla app ($7.60). My girlfriend had the 4th Ward Stroganoff ($13.75) and I had the Feta Chicken ($13.95) as entrees. For drinks, she had a Duvel and I had a Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest on tap. 

As for the starter, I was not very impressed with the quesadilla. The menu advertises it has pepper jack cheese but I detected no pepper jack, just regular monterrey jack cheese. Also, I personally got two bites of crab meat (my girlfiend had several). Given the very mild flavors of crab and monterrey jack, this was a very bland quesadilla. Granted, it did come served with sides of sour cream and salsa and I thought the salsa was pretty good. I just would have preferred the actual quesadilla to stand on its own a bit. 

For the stroganoff, my girlfriend really enjoyed it and would have clean-plated it if she wasn't a carb watcher. I did steal a piece of the beef and thought it was very tasty with the red wine definitely coming through. My Feta chicken was also good (how can you go wrong with Feta?) with extra props going to the sauteed veggies that make up bed along with the penne pasta. They consisted of broccoli, mushrooms, red and green peppers and red onions. I thought they were very well cooked and the white wine/garlic saute was very tasty. The chicken itself was good though a touch overcooked but not enough to ruin the plate. Be advised that, as advertised, it does come sitting in a \"broth\" so is a wet dish. 

Our meal, including two pre-concert tequila shots ;-) and an appropriate tip, came to about $90 -- not cheap but we did splurge on alcohol a bit. 

Service: Our service was excellent with our waitress obviously very familiar the menu and restaurant. As a plus, as it got busier two owner/manager types stayed available in the dining area helping out and making sure everyone's visit was up to par. 

Atmosphere: This must be one of the big draws as AM is in an old converted house right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. All dark wood with a gorgeous bar, its easy to imagine coming here after work to just hangout for awhile. A couple of HD TV's are present, as well.  It is a fairly tight space, however, so I also imagine there must be times when it is standing room only. 

Food: 7/10; Service: 9/10; Value: 7/10; Atmosphere 10/10"}
{"text":"Fantastic date place!!!  This little restaurant has fantastic apps and dinners.  My favorites are the Shrimp Marsala or the What It Is.  The crab soup is excellent also.  When I am there for dinner I always get a half and half with my meal.  But if you are just going for lunch get the chicken quesadillas - excellent.  Ladies!  Watch out for the pole!  Then take a walk around the beautiful Fourth Ward!"}
{"text":"lots of character here.  nothing special but just a solid place to grab drinks and good food.  great neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch. The place was packed and the service was very good. Good food. Nice tavern feel."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte more than a few people mentioned Alexander Michael's to me.  I had my expectations built up.  The place is solid and a decent pub/neighborhood restaurant.  I might have rated it better if people hadn't built it up to me so much before going.  If I lived near the place I would go pretty frequently for a beer or some food.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to get to it (like i would with some other Charlotte places).  All in all - a solid pub/neighborhood bar with some character but nothing earth shattering."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Alexander Michaels and it was a good experience.  I had seen the reviews and a friend recommended a visit.  Glad that I experienced this great place and plan to return.  

In looking at the menu is was all about the open faced turkey sandwich.  Unfortunately they do not offer that with mashed potatoes, WHAT!!!!! that's sac religious.  Not too worry as I had a backup and it was really good.  Had the London Broil sandwich which was really good.  Melt in your mouth goodness.  Probably the best one that I have ever had.   

It is very unassuming from the outside but the vibe is really cool inside.  I really like the dark wood and the way things are layed out.   Service was really good.  We arrived right before the lunch crowd but service was very consistent.  

I want to experience more of the menu and will be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the oldest area of downtown.  An old victorian neighborhood in the midst of downtown Charlotte!  I love the Ruben!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. Loved the Christmas decorations. Dinner was fabulous. Had the baked chicken special, it was perfect! Parking was a little tricky, but worth it."}
{"text":"We stopped in late night after a Knights game. The place was busy, but not packed. We were seated and greeted promptly. The atmosphere alone makes it a great Saturday date spot. Cozy, intimate and not too loud..dimly lit by candlelight. 

The menu is designed to be a mix of American and Creole..but being from Cajun County, I noticed a real lack of authentic creole cuisine. I was interested in tasting the crawfish burrito, but it was pricy ($16) and I assumed it would be disappointing.  Instead, I opted for a London broil sandwich, which I highly recommend. Extra points for offering Shine Bock on tap..a favorite beer I've missed dearly since Texas, where it's commonly served."}
{"text":"Al Mike's is phenomenal. The atmosphere is incredible. The Spicy She Crab soup is the best thing on the menu. Awesome vibe. You might have to wait a little bit for a table on the weekend but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"This was a hard review as it is a very nice little gem of a restaurant hidden away in the 4th ward of Charlotte. But there were some problems. Like the parking. There is only street parking that at times must be hard to find. Also, a couple of beers I wanted to try, they were out of them. The food was ok but not great. Service was good. Probably would never be a regular place for me to go to in the future."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood tavern and I love taking out-of-town guests here.  The food is great and has a homestyle quality.  Our favorites are the fried pickles app, Beef Stroganoff and \"What it Is\" (a nicely spiced chicken in a Cajun cream sauce over Rotini).  It's a feel-good place that definitely notices you when you walk in and remembers you when you come back.  We love the bartenders...nothing like having your favorite drink poured and ready for you AS you settle into your barstool!  And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )"}
{"text":"Love Al Mike's! I love the daily specials that almost always include a fantastic salad and just the other day an authentic Cuban sandwich.  The decor is a mix between old school pub and cozy restaurant.  I've been here several times and seem to always get a salad because they normally do their salads with a spinach leaf base, throw in some pasta for good measure and top it off with fantastic grilled chicken.  

It's a little off the beaten path which can be a breath of fresh air from the places to eat lunch or dinner down Tryon Street.  It looks to be built from one of the renovated homes there in the neighborhood with a 'dollhouse' style exterior in my opinion.  Cool character for a restaurant.

One thing to note is that it's a bit dark in there because there isn't any overhead lighting or if there is, it's very minimal.  So if you sit back towards the back prepare to eat by candlelight (even at lunch).  The only windows are towards the front so that's why."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots I've eaten at in Charlotte. Cozy pub located in a cute local neighborhood, just a few minutes to walk here from Uptown (easier than finding parking in the area).

Ordered the London broil sandwich-it was one of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had. Great quality meat and cheese on a super fresh hoagie roll. The waitress was attentive, always checking in and refilling our drinks. Very casual dress code and laid back atmosphere. Would definitely recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Al Mikes is the neighborhood spot. Food is always on point. Some personal favorites are the \"What it is\" and the \"4th Ward Beef Stroganoff\" . Both are unique and delish pastas. They have a great bar as well. Because of it's cozy ambiance, Alexander Michael's makes a fab date restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday. GREAT service and good food. Had the chicken pita wrap with fries. Nothing too fancy but a great neighborhood bar with a lot of personality. It is located in the historic 4th Ward neighborhood of Charlotte. Walk around before or after your meal and check out the neighborhood, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is a hidden restaurant right in uptown Charlotte. 

The food is amazing. The drinks are amazing, especially the beer selection. It is also a very good place for date night, bro night, or just night. It is so good. :D

 Parking is on the street and it is only for two hours without permit. Just FYI. :D"}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte about a month ago, I have already been to this place about 5 times. I love the atmosphere, the food is always delicious, and they have daily specials that I always look forward to checking out. Local beers, too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Cute little bar tucked away in the 4th ward neighborhood.  Fun atmosphere - and apparently a big pole in the middle of the women's bathroom (see back of menu).  

Had the nachos, fried pickles and the crawfish burrito, all of which were tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place and Paul is THE best! Gets to know you and nothing better than having your drink before you even ask! Great food, friendly service......check it out! Small town feeling in the city"}
{"text":"The Spicy crab soup was great. \"What It Is\" was good with bold flavors. The atmosphere was wonderful, down to earth and friendly. And what topped it off was THE CARROT CAKE!!!!! Superb!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok I stumbled over this place by being invited by a friend. I have lived in Charlotte for going on three months and had no idea this place exsisted.  It is tcuked away in a neighborhood right in downtown.  I hear this place is a establishment in Charlotte and has been around for a long time.  I now know why..  the food is fantastic! The fried pickles are a must a littel salty but good.  I had the Fried Chicken Special with Garlic mash with Gravy and it was GOOOOOOOODD!!!  My friend had the London Broil and looked amazing and the prices were so reasonable.  I highly recommend this place its a chance to see a good ol local hangout in the city of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Local brews, great food, love the dessert, and awesome staff/crowd.  I'm happy to have this treasure in my newfound neighborhood.

We ordered potato wedges, crab soup, stroganoff, wings, carrot cake, and crawfish burritos.  All great choices IMO."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in all of Charlotte.  Great for business lunches.  The london broil sandwich is one of the best steak sandwiches I have ever had.  Nice atmosphere and good beer selection too."}
{"text":"This isn't a fine dining, red carpet, gorgeous decor kind of place. But that's fine! This is a very comfortable, relaxing and finally, affordable restaurant. And frankly it is very nicely designed.  I am all about service. Little weak there when we first walked in and based on its size there is no reason not to be properly greeted. Murphy our Waitress was outstanding. Food was outstanding. Prices were totally affordable and worth every penny three people with an app, two drinks per, meals and one dessert amounted to 100 before tip. When done dining be sure to take a walk around that area. Gorgeous! Thank you for a fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is located in such a great area! Parking can be a little tricky but other than its awesome. The menu and beer selection had a great range and the staff was friendly and make great suggestions. Also my boyfriends family is from Baton Rouge and this place does a great job of incorporating the Cajun flavor in its foods! I will be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, I came with an open mind.  Read the other reviews, thought it was a quaint place.  Great place for a couple of drinks and some appetizers.  The food, on the other hand, is NOT good.

Spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it.  It wasn't even spicy.  Not creamy, more gelatin in consistency.   Please, pass on it.

The London Broil arrived medium well, instead of medium rare.  Figured it was my error at being maybe misunderstood.  No, the waiter was quick to tell me I ordered medium rare.  Took it back and returned with medium rare on the rare side, just the way I like it.  By now, my companions had finished eating.  The meat was so tough, I gave up after a few pieces.  Nothing to write home about.

Parking issue.  There is a parking lot two doors before the restaurant. There is street parking all around if you arrive early enough.  Personally it won't be an issue because I won't be venturing back anytime soon.  

Don't understand the hype. It a neat place. More of the neighborhood bar.  Not a good dinner place."}
{"text":"Al Mike's, as it is locally known, is housed in a 1890's Victorian era building that housed the E.W. Berryhill Store for 70 years. During the 60's & 70's, the building housed multiple businesses, from a paint store, a thrift store, grocery store and delicatessen. In 1983, Michael Alexanders neighborhood tavern opened for business. 

A popular neighborhood institution, Al Mike's retains some interesting building characteristics, such as the supporting pole almost directly in front of the women's restroom door, which lends itself to many a bumped head as well as built in coolers that are original turn of the century ice box coolers. 

We dined on the Spicy Crab Soup, which one of my dining partners characterized as melted Velveeta with crab and while that description might sound rather unappealing, it was quite yummy. In addition to the three cheese on Texas Toast sandwich, which was ok, but a bit on the dry side, my other dining companions had other basics, such as sandwiches and burgers. This is tavern food, so don't go expecting high end meals. The appeal of this restaurant, as a visitor to Charlotte, is that it is located in the Fourth Ward, a small district of brick and Victorian buildings and the unique history of the building that houses Al Mike's."}
{"text":"An old house tucked back in fourth ward. Almost as if you're not even in uptown anymore. The dining space is TIGHT which is part of what makes the dining experience fun. Drinks are great; craft beer and wine menu. Check out the women's bathroom if you're female ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for an early lunch. The place wasn't crowded at all so we were immediately seated and got our drinks. The waitress and other employees were very friendly and were always around when we needed something. The food was delicious. I had the Mikes Hot Turkey Sandwich, which was pretty unique, but very flavorful. The turkey was juicy and had great flavor and the gravy was also well made on it. Alexander Michaels is definitely a place I will return to on my trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite \"neighborhood-y\" type of place in town--and, come to think of it, one of the only restaurants in town that has that sort of feel. Dark, cozy--just a really cool spot. Not far from uptown, but in a more residentially area than you'd expect. It even kinda looks like a house from the road. 

Great bar scene if you're looking to meet up for a few drinks (definitely not the type of place to really meet people or get sloppy, if that's what you're looking to do), with really cool, knowledgeable bartenders. 

Good food, too. Last time in, I had the wings (definitely above average) and a pulled-pork sandwich, which was great. Simple, American-style food but done well, with great ingredients. 

Definitely a great date place. Cool vibe and classy in an understated way--check it out!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local-to-Charlotte favorite, your search is over. This has been one of my hubby's fav spots since he moved to the Queen City 10 years ago, and now it's one of mine as well. 

You'll walk in and immediately sense the darker, hole-in-the-wall vibe and the close-knit seating arrangement, providing a louder bar-like atmosphere but overall cozy ambience. Our favorite booths are in the back closer to the restrooms, especially the one where you're forced to sit next to your partner/dinner mate. Yes, we are those people. :) 

The fried pickle chips with homemade ranch for dipping are a must-have for every meal at Al Mike's. I branched out from the regular menu options during my last visit and \"made my own pasta\" with pesto and OH.EM.GEE was it amazing. Took me back to our trip to Italy... seriously. 

Overall, awesome vibe and fun place to bring guests to the Queen City. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Alexander Michael's is like an old, trusty friend. No matter how long it is between visits, every time you're reunited, it's like no time has passed at all. We only make it to Al Mike's a few times a year because it's just so tucked into 4th Ward -- parking is tough, there is occasionally a wait, and quite frankly, we forget about it sometimes. When we're in the neighborhood though (usually for the 4th Ward home/garden tours), a visit is a must. 

Service is always laid back yet attentive. They don't mind if you linger but you never go without something you need -- mayo, another napkin, beer refill... The food is solid, too. My favorite appetizer is the potato skins. Their crab soup is to die for. And, I know it sounds weird after I just ticked off apps with bacon and seafood, but their vegetarian quinoa black bean burger is my go-to entree. It has feta cheese and avocado on it. Simply delish!"}
{"text":"This is a quiet neighborhood bar with quality food and great service.  This is a good lunch spot and a nice quiet place for dinner and drinks tucked away in Fourth Ward.  Parking can be difficult as it is all on street.  I bring out of town guests here often because it is so different than what most would expect of a city like Charlotte.

I always enjoy their sandwiches and baked chicken.  I used to get grilled cheese and soup as my main order but it wasn't on the menu my last visit.  Their she-crab soup is also very good.  

The drink prices seem very average for the area."}
{"text":"I've had Alexander Michael's bookmarked for a while. I came in during lunch hour with a friend, I was expecting this place to be packed. Luckily, we arrived before the crowd---no wait time. 

The menu is very basic. American cuisine, nothing to scream about. Menu items include Soups, Salads, sandwiches, burgers, and more. I really came for the spicy crab soup which was disappointing in my opinion. Most of the ingredients were great, except the imitation crab (the disappointing part) I picked through it and ate everything else. My friend tasted and confirmed that it was imitation crab. You can taste the sweet flavor---ugh! Now if this was real crab! Ohhhh buddy!! The flavor would've been amazing!! I didn't feel like sending the food back, I wasn't interested in trying anything else. So please excuse my diverse pallet. 

Was the service great? Yes! Our waiter was very nice. Side street parking was easy to find. The restaurant was clean. Will I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the good service and old school cool bar atmosphere, I would've given this place a one star. Food was pretty abysmal, and I'm not sure where the Cajun food was on the menu except some seasoning on the fries. Maybe the dinner menu is better? I was sad we couldn't order the fried pickles at lunch but at least they had three local breweries on tap. The quinoa burger with pasta salad was a let down, not much flavor. In a historic neighborhood that was pleasant to walk through though!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What an amazing place! Jerk Chicken Quesadilla is a must have!!! Good list of local brews. Tracy provided great service....working the bar and the tables! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were sent here a few years ago.  We were looking for a place for date night.  Although loud, it was great.  The story behind the building and its decor was interesting to read.  The food is good.  As most reviewers have stated, it is definitely a hidden gem.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Always love this place! Good food, great atmosphere!! Love the spicy crab soup, not to mention the staff is awesome!!"}
{"text":"It's worth the wait on busy nights. They'll never under quote your waiting time like most restaurants will. In my opinion they have the best service in charlotte. 

Their unusual chips they use for the nachos make them very memorable and filling. Very delicious. You can never go wrong with their crab soup or wings either."}
{"text":"Nice food selections, great drinks of course.

Great fourth ward place. My beef here is the lighting is just TOO dark. Cain't see the dang menus or nuthin! But a fine neighborhood bar.

And fried pickles!!!"}
{"text":"In the cutest neighborhood in Charlotte, is a great pub style joint perfect for a brew and some excellently prepared food.  It's a rub shoulders kind of joint with dark benches perfect for long conversations."}
{"text":"Tucked in a quaint neighborhood in the 4th ward, Alexander Michaels is a great lunch or dinner spot in Charlotte. I've eaten here a handful of times now and have been impressed each and every time. For starters, I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Quesadillas and the black bean hummus - both are excellent and definitely worth trying. For entrees I've had the Quinoa Black Bean Burger and the Rueben. The veggie burger is one of the best in town (in my humble opinion) and the Rueben is a tasty option as well. 

The service has always been top notch as well. I've never had a bad experience at Alexander Michaels and consider it one of my go-to restaurants when I'm looking for a unique charlotte restaurant that you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Do you remember that scene in Dolly Parton's \"Smoky Mountain Christmas,\" after she's ingratiated herself to the orphans who've been squatting in her friend's cabin, and they're all sitting cozy, around a fire, stringing popcorn, eating Mountain Dan's fruitcake and singing Christmas songs? That's what Alexander Michael's feels like during the holidays. Pure country charm, cheer and delicious food! I visited here last year and am planning to stop in again this year for the holidays - it just feels like down home family dinner (with a functional family, not your dysfunctional one)."}
{"text":"Warm welcome & quick bar stool seat. Spicy tasty veggie burger & good fresh broccoli slaw. Beer selection good tried light Node lager. Great find while searching neighborhoods to visit. Crowded a little loud but upbeat & friendly."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot where you can get good food and good drinks! the atmosphere is nice, perfect for drinking after 5pm. !!! 
Service is friendly, it is just a good hidden diamond outskirts of the city.
We can't wait to go back, next time no kids, although they had hamburgers for the kids it really isn't a spot for kids."}
{"text":"Nachos are amazing! Try them original or with chicken. 'What it is' is also great. Everything we tried was awesome so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the few bars in the uptown (ish) area that doesn't feel like some sort of corporate cookie cutter joint. Combine that with good (german!) beer and you've got a real winner. 

They food isn't going to blow your mind per se but it's pretty good. Their fried pickles are among the best and the \"what it is\" chicken dish is hearty and satisfying.

Solid comfort food/beer joint."}
{"text":"My first impression was what a cute neighborhood! The historic and charming homes are such a treat in a city where everything seems brand new. 

Upon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly. 

I ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine), a side salad, and the \"What it is\" . The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The \"What it is\" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department. 

My biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it. I realize its a small venue with limited seating but there wasn't anyone waiting for a table and last  I checked this was not at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and every experience has been great, whether stopping by for lunch or dinner. It's definitely a gem in 4th Ward and worth stopping in if you're in the area.

My latest stop into Alexander Michael's was to continue my quest around Charlotte to find the best reuben in the city. The classic sandwich didn't disappoint. The corned beef was OK, a little above average, and the kraut was your standard store-bought style. It was loaded up with flavorful cheese and russian, adding an unhealthy but delicious flavor. Where the reuben really stood out though was the bread - it was full of that great rye flavor you're looking for and crisped up perfectly. Additionaly, the ingredients were proportioned perfectly - something I've rarely found on my journey. When it all came together it was one of the better reubens I've tried of the approximately 30 so far. It's definitely a place I plan to head back to so I can enjoy another delicious reuben from this great establishment."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to check out this hidden gem. It's in an old house on 9th street in a quiet neighborhood. Inside is 80's pub and looks like they haven't changed much. Loved it. We grabbed the last available table and had great service. There were several couples out for a date night and groups of friends. Great, cozy vibe. 

Good beer selection. We were feeling like splitting a couple apps instead of ordering meals. Wings were good but nothing special. I liked the black bean hummus. Nachos were great. Flour chips instead of corn-- which by boyfriend really loved. Lots of toppings! 

So many of their entrees and pasta dishes looked good, can't wait to go back and try one!"}
{"text":"Al Mike's is my favorite neighborhood bar in Charlotte, NC.  The only problem with it is that its too far away from my house!  :)  It is a treat to visit the 4th ward.  Great food, drinks, and company!"}
{"text":"Decent place. The food was good. They have some good choices on their lunch menu, and a great local beer selection. I ordered the Reuben and the Cajun Fries. I liked the Cajun Fries a lot."}
{"text":"Perfect hole in the wall, true pub. The half pound burger is maybe the best I've ever had and the selection of local brews is the perfect compliment. If you are a local looking for a \"regular spot,\" or a tourist looking for that \"place only the locals know about,\" Al Mike's is it!"}
{"text":"5 star experience.

Old school barman know what their talking about and give the place a quality but welcoming feel.

Music went from the lesser know beatles songs to Dylan.

Food was fantastic, I had the kind broil + an additional side of the slaw which was not too wet. Carrot cake was moist and fresh and a definite must. 

Finally, beer selection was spesh, no just picking beers at random gimmicks here, good selection of hard to find ales. 

Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Feels like home! The place is small, but it feels so cozy and warm. They don't take reservations, but the wait is never a problem because you can sit at the bar and enjoy some local craft beers. We had the \"what it is\" and the \"honey chicken\" and loved both. The staff is nice and attentive and makes you feel like a local the second you walk in. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The bartender was excellent and a great local bar with good beer selection, but it was listed as creole food and it has none.  Crab soup with imitation crab. Left and went to kings kitchen."}
{"text":"Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food, good drinks and superb company all packaged into a quaint little spot in the 4th ward. 

Hubs and I used to frequent this sweet little spot fairly often when we lived Uptown. It's the perfect locale for a delicious burger or even better, in my opinion, an amazing chicken pita. I've tried a handful of different things at this stop, but I always go back to the pita. Plenty of moist, well seasoned bird stuffed into a fluffy, mouth watering pita, special sauce, cheese and lettuce and tomato. If I'm feeling all healthy schmealthy I go for a side salad or fruit, but their onion rings are pretty tasty too!

The service has always been super friendly and laid back - just how I like it at this kind of joint. Next time my tummy's growling in the 4th ward I'll definitely make a trip back to Alexander Michael's!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Entrees are $15-20 but I come for the sandwiches. They can't be beat for $8-11."}
{"text":"Need a good, unique date spot? Here's the place. Great little hidden gem in uptown's historic 4th Ward neighborhood.

Food: First things first... whatever meal you get make sure to get a cup or bowl of the spicy crab soup. Money. Not so hungry or just want a snack? The fried pickles are spot on. The London Broil is just fantastic. The marinade they use on it is super delicious. Dinner version comes sliced up in entree form... lunch as a sandwich. You get a side item with both.

Bar: They have a good selection of local beers. If the restaurant is busy and you can't get a table... sit here. The service is always top notch.

Parking: there is a lot less than a block from the restaurant between Graham and Pine. There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding parking here. I think a lot of it is because the signs are kind of confusing. You can park there for two hours without a parking permit. Bonus: had too much to drink and need to take a cab? The A Mike's staff will you show you where you can park your car overnight.

I love to bring out of town guests here. Such a charming place in a great neighborhood. Warm, welcoming, homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner. Their Fried pickles are amazing and have an awesome beer selection! This is my go to place for a fun relaxing evening dinner uptown."}
{"text":"I liked the place.  Food is definitely bar food, but great atmosphere.  Warm, inviting, wood everywhere, nice folks."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar Saturday night for a few drinks and dinner. The bar was not full. We got our drinks and asked if we could order our dinner when she got a chance. We waited 20 minutes and asked the same question. The bartender rolled her eyes and said, \"when I get a chance\". The food was acceptable, not great, and the service was crappy at best."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Uptown area and have been frantically trying to experience every bar and restaurant the city has to offer to find my \"go-to\" joint. We were \"tipped off\" by a fellow Charlottinian about Alexander Michael's, and were intrigued by the directions he gave us to get there. \"You're not far from it. Off the beaten path. Shortcut through the shrubs.\" I already liked it. 

Once we found the shortcut, we immediately smelled the food and followed our noses. It is tucked away in a residential area and if the food didn't smell so good you might walk right by it. We sat at the bar and needed to pull the candle closer in order to read the menu. If you take anything from this review let it be this: Honey. Garlic. BBQ Wings. YUM.

I ordered the veggie burger as my main and was expecting nothing exciting, since most restaurants serve the usual warm-on-the-outside-cold-in-the-middle-sad-excuse-for-a-meal hockey puck. I was surprised that it was not only excellent and flavorful, but clearly home made. They had a great selection of micro-brewed beers in addition to the usual suspects, so my fiancee was happy from the moment we sat down. Laid back, fun and low-key, we definitely found our go-to joint. Oh, and ladies, watch out for the pole in the bathroom. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I've never waited long at Alexander Michaels, which has always been nice. The ambiance is friendly and very casual which makes spending time with others there relaxing and fun. The 4th Ward location offers an escape from the city, without having to leave the city. 

The food is not something that I've ever felt was out-of-this-world, but it definitely is good. A lot of friends have loved their selection, but I just may not have made the right entree selections.

Regardless, I'm looking forward to my next trip back to Al Mike's"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  On the edge of uptown, but it doesn't really have an uptown feel.  Very cozy atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Al Mike's looks like a house that turned their 1st floor into a bar. The atmosphere is really chill, and they have good cheap beers on tap and serve typical bar food. There was plenty of street parking when I went. 

My fave part of Al Mikes is that it's a very non-uptowny bar in uptown, check it out!

Btw, what is with people and fried pickles?!"}
{"text":"I liked the drinks and dessert. The garden salad was only adequate, the London broil was difficult to finish as vinegar overwhelmed the taste, and the bread was unbelievably dreadful. The service was excellent as well as the vibe."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Amazing. Came here after a 9 hour drive from Tampa for a little birthday dinner and my lanta it surpassed honestly anything I could've imagined. The London broil was to die for. My boyfriend got the hamburger and baked potato which were also delicious! I would probably come back to charlotte just for that London broil alone though! The character of the place was great! It was totally unexpected with all different kinds of people from 20 something's to families to older couples. Large selection of alcoholic drinks and very friendly staff! Definitely would recommend again and again and again"}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!  A nice relaxing neighborhood restaurant.  

The London Broil sandwich is awesome!  The crab soup is Awesome!  

I got a turkey sandwich that was on special once and it was just OK.  

I believe the owner works there everyday.  Good staff.  I can't wait to go back.  

One of my favorites."}
{"text":"A down home family restaurant and bar .... Irish style... I feel like I'm home ! Great food, great service.

If you like the warmth of dark wood paneling, old style bars and that kind of special feeling some real Irish pubs have (in Ireland I mean) then this place is for you. The setting just enhances the cozy menu with its homey grilled cheese and chili, London broil sandwich and the lightest onion rings I've ever had.

It's even a family run business and if you're lucky, you might even meet the younger family members helping out some afternoon like we did ... Made the day even more special!"}
{"text":"Always, always great food!  Then, you have consistently great service.  This is a wonderful, cozy tavern serving delicious comfort food.  I always try something different and am always pleased with my order.  Tonight we enjoyed fried pickles, catfish and grilled buffalo chicken.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  The place was hopping on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and we were lucky to snag a spot at the bar.  The bartenders were very friendly and on the money with getting us beers and taking our orders.  We both had the london broil sandwich (medium rare, yo!) and I had the side of fries.

The fries.

New winners, folks, of best fries in the world.  I will make the 3 hour drive for those fries, any day."}
{"text":"Capitalizing LOVE doesn't do Al Mike's justice. I moved to Fourth Ward in 2014 after being in Charlotte for six years. I bought a place off South Blvd. in 2016 and one of the very few things (only, maybe) I miss about Fourth Ward is Al Mike's. They are great for a sit-down dinner in a wooden booth that screams old school privacy. At the same time, the bar is inviting to hang out with your neighbors over a pint or mixed drink at a good price.

The staff is the best in Uptown and as good as you'll find in the city. Tucked into the base of the old neighborhood market, this is a true treasure of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I been there twice, and was worried that the second time would be a let down. Not so - I love this bar. The best part: it's walkable from my place, most of the clientele was born in the 70's, they sell my favorite beer (Duvel), and have a greek-themed menu. Pretty much perfection for me."}
{"text":"Impeccable service! Hostess/waitress was amazing! She was very accommodating and knowledgeable of the area. Food was good but not exceptional. I had the London broil sandwich which they are famous for and the meet was very tender. The atmosphere was exceptional! I would recommend as a great place to stop for a snack and a quick drink or a social hour or two with some of the friendliest staff and best beer in the downtown Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I have visited Charlotte many times but had not been to the restaurant before last weekend. This is the perfect place to go for good food, beer and atmosphere.

Its a real gem, tucked away but worth looking for and is firmly on my list of favorites in Charlotte.

If I lived in Charlotte I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night and business was booming!  Yay!  I am absolutely in love with the neighborhood that holds this little gem.  It is especially nice all decorated for Christmas.  The restaurant is so cozy and warm.  I love the feeling when I walked in.  I felt right at home.  I was so happy with everything about the atmosphere.  Parking is a little tricky, as there is no lot, but only street parking. 

The place lived up to it's reviews.  I was happy with the service and the food was amazing.  The had drink specials, but I choose a glass of red wine to warm me up.  It was perfect!  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  I had the crab soup to start-yum!!!  I ordered the beef stroganoff for my main dish and it was an exceptional choice.   I opted for fettuccini noodles instead of rotini.  The waitress actually forgot and remembered right when she gave it to me (not a big deal), but she insisted on taking it back and fixing it.  She was so nice, she even brought me extra wine on the house for waiting. 

I really enjoyed this place and I can not wait to get back here and try more."}
{"text":"This is one of my locals and they have their staple dishes. The location is great surrounded by historical homes all with a story. This is a good stop for a different feel on the way for an uptown adventure. Food is not the greatest however the overall ambience will sell you and keep you coming back. This is a must do in clt."}
{"text":"(repost - since I'd originally had this under Andrew Blair's, and I confuse two-named things constantly)

Weird. I feel like I ate at a totally different place than every other reviewer. Maybe ABs gets flustered when they try to put on their fancy-pants for Restaurant Week.

Yeah, it's a little faux-pub, a little fratty, but there are only two TVs (god, my standards are dropping) and the food is cheap. What did I get? The nachos. What will I probably get every time I come? Said nachos. No art, no pretention - fried flour tortillas dusted with something aromatic and carefully smothered with black beans, cheese, tomatoes, and (tehehe) lettuce shreds we'll just go ahead and call chiffonade. Simple, textural, good. For 7 bucks. Jalapenos needed, my spicy friends, so ask. The size of your head, this pile, no, torso.

It's 1994 up in this joint, and they don't give a damn - but it limits the veg selections. I can respect the beer list, and the service was quietly good. Darkish lighting. I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach underneath the 5 pounds of nacho that the place swims in RL polos and Sperrys on the wkends (and this is before I perused other yelper's thoughts on the subject) but for Monday night nosh, it competently hit the spot."}
{"text":"I came in during a very busy time last night and the staff greeted me and my guest at the door with a smile. We were shown to a \"half booth\" in the back with the option to wait for a real table, but we found it quite cozy. 

We began with the nachos which were delicious. The soft chips are a nice spin on classic nachos. I had the \"What it is\" which is said to be a favorite on the menu. It is basically a Cajun chicken pasta. It was very good, a tad salty but good. My guest ordered the honey chicken pasta with the tomato bacon sauce which she enjoyed. The helpings were very generous. 

Our service was great the whole time we were there. We were in a back corner on a busy night and we never went long with something we needed. We thought the prices were quite fair for the food. 

I loved the neighborhood feel of the place, it reminded me of a big city back street restaurant. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went here for a Saturday lunch.  The place is really cute, tucked in the heart of the fourth ward.  The inside had great old retro decor and art. The menu was good for pub food, great sandwiches and apps.  The salads were ok, nothing special.  My Reuben was delicious, as well as the onion rings. My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich, blackened on a pita, and it was outstanding. He wanted to order a second one! The chicken wings appetizer was also delicious. They were meaty wings and cooked well with delicious sauce.  The only drawback is that the menu lacks healthy options.  Everything comes on bread or with a side of fried items.  As long as you are ok with eating not so healthy food (I mean it is a pub...) then it's fantastic! I would like to try the dinner menu, and BF wants to go back for that sandwich ASAP!"}
{"text":"Such a solid restaurant, and a quaint local spot all rolled into one. You really can't go wrong with a trip to Alexander Michael's (aka Al Mike's). The food here is prepared fresh and is simply delicious, and there's something for everyone on the menu. 

We stopped in for lunch today, and made it in a little before the typical lunch rush. I went with their three cheese melt and a cup of their spicy crab soup. It was perfect for a chilly December day in Charlotte. Do not be alarmed by the \"spicy\" in their crab soup, it really is more a subtle heat, and I am one that is a wuss when it comes to spicy foods, and I gobbled it up! It really is a very mild spice that just warms you up right along with the rest of the soup. The chunks of crab in here let you know the soup is the real deal too! Simply delicious! 

My husband went with the burger and pasta salad. I had a little bit of plate envy when I saw the size of the burger, and totally stole some pasta salad. Ask your server for some of their house vinegrette to put on the pasta salad, if they don't bring it out already. It's good!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Staff greeted us immediately and sat us quickly.  Food was great.  We shared the fried pickles and had the crawfish burrito and the \"what is it\".  I can't stress enough on how excellent the services was.  For as crowded as they were it was quite amazing we were treated like royalty!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their crab soup! It's so good I buy it by the half gallon and take it home. Their burgers are the only other thing I've tried, which are also amazing. Really great atmosphere for a date, girls night or even lunch. You'll also love the staff!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Al Miike's this week. The Food was greatl The locals and the staff or great for company. The bartender suggested Today's Special, meatloaf, mash, and gravy. Awesome comfort food to go along with the warm welcoming locally owned and managed bar and restaurant. If you haven't been to Al Mikes, you are truly missing out on an amazing all around warm neighborhood tavern experience. Charlotte's version of Cheers... where you can feel like, \"everybody knows your name.\""}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere in that cozy neighborhood pub where you feel like you belong. The restaurant was in full swing, and the owner took care of our table to make sure service standards were met. The \"what it is\" is phenomenal, and they offer a fantastic selection of local beers. Will definitely be back, thanks for making us feel like family!"}
{"text":"This is a cute small pub with pretty good food. Tucked away within the 4th Ward neighborhood this restaurant has soul. I went on a Saturday night and it was crowded yet we didn't wait for a table longer than ten minutes. I had the Jerk Chicken Quesadilla and potato wedges which were delicious. The customer service really is what sets the bar high as everyone was nice and attentive. I will definitely visit again. #yum"}
{"text":"Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.

My dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since, fried pickles don't exist in CA, I loved eating them while I was out in Charlotte.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would eat at this place again.   ;o)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I love the history of the building, the friendliness of the employees and the overall experience. This is a great date spot because of the ambiance and energy (also you can stroll through the nearby park after dinner). I feel like there are two groups of people - those who don't know about Al Mikes and those who love it (and hope the others don't ever try it so that the wait times don't get too outrageous). I am in the group that love it!

First of all, every employee is welcoming and friendly. The owner/manager (I'm not sure) clearly loves the place and the people. He is the host, he brings out the food, he buses tables, he checks in with guests, etc. I love the way he takes pride in making sure every customer has a great experience. I consistently get the \"What It Is\". The flavor is great and the portion size always allows for sharing and having leftovers the next day. My boyfriend samples different things on the menu but loves the beef stroganoff. He tried the london broil (kinda dry) and the wings (could've been a little more crispy) but says the beef stroganoff is the best thing he has tried. Friends say their veggie burger is awesome, but I haven't tried it. 

Parking can be tricky but we don't mind walking a little bit if needed, so it isn't a problem. There is usually a wait but it's worth it. Overall this is a great spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in charlotte- the food is consistently delicious and the atmosphere is laid back with a friendly, neighborhood vibe. The menu is fairly small but has a little bit of everything: classic bar appetizers, pasta dishes, burgers and sandwiches. They also have a decent selection of local beers on draft.

I usually always get one of the pasta dishes like the honey chicken or the what it is. Last night I opted for the penne Athena and it was delicious! The cream sauce was flavorful but still very light and the veggies were fresh and delicious. As a starter I highly recommend the crab soup- it's so good, I could honestly make a meal out of just that!

Another thing I really love about Al Mike's is that all of their chicken is natural and raised without antibiotics which is a surprising touch for a tavern-style restaurant, but it is very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Came in to Charlotte on business and saw this getting consistently good reviews on Trip Advisor...

So glad I stopped in! This place is overflowing with charm and character, and their drink selection is 

The waitress recommended the NoDa IPA and I'm so glad she did! So hoppy and bold; paired really well with the blackened fish I got and the crab soup, which is as good as everyone says it is!

Blackened fish was *a hair* salty for me, but I've been watching a lot of chopped so maybe I'm being judgy. Went great with some beer tho!

FYI the cook on the fish was phenomenal; as someone living in DFW I appreciate good fish when I can get it! TBH I would be just find having the NoDa IPA and the crab soup by itself though, both very comforting and filling. Yum!

All in all, everything was on point and I had a fantastic experience; I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch here and we loved it! It's located in a great location uptown and the service was great! My husband enjoyed the wings and I had a fantastic sandwich! Can't wait to go back and experience during dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch w/ some coworkers. Was surprisingly quiet. Had the jerk chicken salad special, was delicious, didn't need salad dressing. Service was incredible, even called a cab for my colleagues who needed to get to the airport. Down to earth, casual, would probably be one of my go-to places if I were a local."}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Good variety of food to choose from. Well priced. We had a group of 6 and they had no problem seating us and getting us food in a timely manner. We will come back next time we are in the area"}
{"text":"The best meal we had in a long time.  Beautiful old decor, excellent and fast service, and delicious food.  A restaurant with an intelligent sense of humor: read the back cover of the menu, talk to the staff, and you shall see.  The portions are generous, and soft drinks and teas get refilled without having to ask.  Crab soup, nachos, fries, onion rings, chicken dishes, and the London Broil were all perfect.  They had a good selection of beer and wine, all available by glass, but had to drive, so could not try.  The prices are moderate, which makes this place an excellent value, which I would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Excellent service from an incredibly friendly staff. However, the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Alexander Michael's is one of my favorite places to go in Charlotte.  The aesthetic feel is very homey, and the service is excellent.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered Alexander Michael's.  I would recommend the pasta dishes, burgers, london broil sandwich, wings, and jerk chicken quesadillas.  The pricing is very reasonable as well.  Do yourself a favor and dine at Alexander Michael's."}
{"text":"Local's spot for folks that live uptown. Old school and excellent. If you don't like this place then \"Fuck You!\" Period. They don't need you."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love Al Mikes and the staff. Steve is always there working hard. Paul is one of our favorite bar tenders in Charlotte. Not too many pescetarian options which is my only downfall but the food is delicious with amazing craft beer choices! Get the nachos you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The most amazing hidden gem. Delicious food and incredible atmosphere. Favorite place to go for a drink or dinner in Charlotte."}
{"text":"There's something about the simplicity of this place, and the friendliness of the staff, that keeps bringing me back here. Since I've moved to Charlotte, I've tried the fried  pickles at almost every restaurant I've been to, and I have to say.. the ones at Alexander Michael's are among the top three in this city! The food is simple and tasty (even if you just want a simple garden burger, Cajun fried & a blue moon!) The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. It's a great place to visit even on a Monday evening!"}
{"text":"Shh.
The first rule of Alexander Michael's is: you do not talk about Alexander Michael's.
The second rule of Alexander Michael's is: you DO NOT talk about Alexander Michael's.
The third rule is to not run into the pole in the woman's bathroom and don't go upstairs because it's haunted. But that's for another review.

You would miss this place if you were strolling through 4th ward looking at the houses, because it fits right in. Located in an older house, the ambiance is casual but dark. Food style: It's an amalgamation of Cajun and American, nothing too off the wall. But it's all delicious.

The Lady and I went here on a double date, where the other couple did everything in their power not to order the What it Is, partially because they both knew they needed to branch out. So we started off with an order of fried pickles and I ordered the What it Is, you know, so they could still look at it (I'm SUCH a nice guy!!). 

The fried pickles were great, as was the dipping sauce. The main dish came out, and holy cow it looks great. Everyone's looks great. And it tastes the same as it looks. Oh man, that cajun sauce and perfectly blackened chicken...*shudder*. I had to really force myself not to finish the whole thing so I could save some for leftovers.

The price point was a little bit higher than an average night out (you're looking at ~$18 for an entree, you could absolutely order other things though and still have a full meal for cheaper!), but it was well worth it. I can't wait to come back here and try out more, this seems like a really special place. I don't think I'll ever get on the 'regular' status, but Alexander Michael's seems to have a lot of those, and honestly, you're treated like one either way."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great except for the lack of AC. Stay away when it is over 80 degrees unless something changes."}
{"text":"Parking may be tight in this historic neighborhood, but charm is large.  We happened to find a spot close to a beautiful vintage Chevrolet truck, which may be the restaurant mascot.
When we entered the restaurant, this man, who was big on presence, strode toward us and showed us to a booth.  He told us who our server would be and ensured our comfort.
A server arrived and took our drink orders. We also requested an appetizer, the black bean hummus.  We could have it with a kick or not.  Of course, I chose the kick.  OMG!  This was the best hummus that I have had.  It was served on a bed of shredded lettuce and chopped tomato, that added to the goodness of this dish. The pita bread served as a delectable anchor.
Because we had ordered an appetizer, I chose a lighter meal for my entree.  I requested a chef salad sans meat with blue cheese dressing.  Fresh and loaded with vegetables, it was.  My husband got the crawfish burrito and enjoyed it as well.
Wanna come back here.  What a charming spot."}
{"text":"I would have given 3.5.

Some have given this place high marks just for being a great neighborhood bar but I am focused more on the food so can't speak to its bar life so to speak.

The obvious high marks are what others have already simply stated...great, hidden gem, neighborhood feel, house converted, bla bla bla...Yes, that's all very true.  

Bring your glasses if you have poor eyesight because this place is very dimly lit but I think it adds to the romantic aspect and it makes it pretty cozy.

The service was mediocre...I have to give a shout out to the buff host that has been there all 3 times that I have.  He looks like an abercrombie model that moonlights as the host of Alexander Michael's.  He just makes me smile for some reason.  But as far as the wait staff..eh, ok.  They seemed overly busy and understaffed quite honestly.  I hated to even ask any questions to our waitress in fear of flight.  She didn't stick around and she seemed to just have too much going on in general.  Whatever, no big deal.  

The food I think is consistently good.  The fried pickles are good, their cajun fries are crispy, good flavor, their other sides are OK, not amazing.  I tried their veggie and quinoa burger and I thought it was pretty good!  My friend had the burger and wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked so that was a BAD sign.  Not fresh.  Aaaand, it wasn't.  It was a little dry, not much flavor, just bleh in general.  The prices are right for their burgers and sandwhiches but they really should be based on the quality.

They have other specials and regular meal items that may be amazing but overall I think everything is just basic, consistent, good, not great.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but I wouldn't kick and scream if invited to go again."}
{"text":"Great 80s comfort food.  A must place to visit while in fourth ward.  The Ruben is the best with a side of pasta salad.  The pasta salad is simple but very good. A great place for a date or a small group before a Hornets game or the theater.  Several good micro beers too. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the small, quaint feel of the place. This combined with the dim lighting and rustic wood makes it a great date spot. Food was delicious. The menu has an array of pasta's and hearty meat dishes. Good selection of local beers as well. ONLY reason This review isn't accompanied by 5 stars is the parking situation outside, which is pretty rough but that can be said about any location in Uptown. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!

Parking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  

The food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \"crab\" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.

I will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It was a Thursday night at 8 and the place was full but we didn't wait at all as I think we got the last table.  I've been here one other time on a Friday or Saturday and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 2.  The service was good and pretty quick for how busy they were.

We tried the Ruben and it was one of the better Rubens we have had.  The sides were a little better than average, but the broccoli slaw was outstanding.  We also had the London broil, better than average but just a little tough.  The jerk chicken quesadilla was amazing and we would definitely get it again.

We will come back here for sure, for the food, the good beer selection, and the chill atmosphere.  A great place.  Would have given five stars had the menu been a little bigger offering more variety."}
{"text":"Top notch casual local watering hole in a part of Charlotte called \"Fourth Ward.\" It is inside the 277 perimeter and not far from the skyscrapers of Uptown.

In addition to a number of great local brews on tap, they have an excellent menu of bar grub that's better than most places. The burgers are top notch and even on a busy night, did not take long to appear."}
{"text":"Back again, 9 of us this time!
Short and sweet.

Say it with me people!
\"BURGERS, WINGS, AND BEER! OH MY!\"

Great place, Great Owner, Great employees!

See you all soon!"}
{"text":"I heard really good things about this place, but I wasn't sure what to expect. It was very different than I expected. Alexander Michael's is in a cute, old house in the 4th ward and has a COMPLETELY different feel than anywhere else in Charlotte. It is a dark, pub feel. I assume they would have mixed drinks, but it's definitely more of a beer place. They have a large selection of local beers, which I love. The night I went it was 100 degrees outside, so I wasn't much in the mood for food. I didn't see a lot of lighter options on the menu that I would eat (I'm picky), but I did try the \"What It Is\" pasta. So glad I did because it was delicious! If you're looking for a unique, small place in Charlotte, go visit!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, laid back crowd."}
{"text":"We had to unexpectedly stay in Charlotte due to airline issues on our way to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. North Carolina is obviously NOT our Caribbean beach getaway. HOWEVER, once we finally got in our room and settled, this place was only a $18 cab ride from our hotel at the airport. 

Perfect quaint little neighborhood bar with a downtown view, surrounded by little brownstone homes, serving local beers, local rums, and a variety of awesome food! This is the only time we've ever stopped in NC. If you're here for a night, looking for a good dose of awesome localness, 5 stars! 

See YA tomorrow, Caribbean!"}
{"text":"Alexander Michael's is what you wish your local bar/brewpub was like. It truly is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile on your face. Others have said it here, but I am going to go ahead and reiterate that this spot is truly a gem and all the people inhabiting the 4th Ward of Charlotte are lucky to have it. 

What makes it so special? Well, as alluded to above, the quaint neighborhood feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, and you most certainly are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial conversations, laughter, and a real community feeling. 

The food is typical American pub food fare but done extremely well. I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy crab soup is excellent and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy black beans, or a big ol' baked potato (this option probably gives you the best bang for your buck!). 

Right now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot has a rotating line-up of high quality draft beers with a huge emphasis on North Carolina beers and an even greater emphasis on Charlotte specific brews. Problem solved! On top of that, there is also a full bar and a few selections in the wine department. 

Oh, and when is the best time to check this spot out? Right before you head out to a Panthers game of course!"}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems in the Queen City. The locals will tell you, Al Mikes is the place to grab some food if you're in the area. The food is consistently good, I recommend trying whatever nightly special they have for dinner. The specials are always different and delicious. 

The full bar offers drafts and bottled beer. The atmosphere is laid back without being divey. It's a comfortable experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"As always, the food here is just as amazing as the decor (old general store), atmosphere & staff.  You name it.  As many have said, this is \"bar type\" food but it is always so much better than that so I hate to put it in that genre.    

We were seated very quickly as a waitress was already walking to greet us as we walked into the door.  We sat down & were checked on very regularly by whom I assuming is one of the owners.  Real cool laid back kind of guy.  

As per usual, we got an order of wings (wild flavor) & I had my mind all made up to try something different today off of the menu (usually eat a burger or London broil sandwich), but was told of two specials that both sounded incredible.  The first one, grilled cheese with hearty chicken stew, is what I had.  My friend and his brother had the other special, meatloaf w/ onions on rye bread.  Everything was tasty and great as always.  The wings are hands down some of my favorite anywhere.  My friend also got some crab soup which he said was very good.  

Hands down one of my favorite places in Charlotte and can say without a doubt have never even had a mediocre experience here, let alone a bad one.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Incredibly cozy and off the beaten path!

Love the food, service and atmosphere - definitely a great date night spot :)

Best tip about this place: so much to look at and take in, plus their menu provides all the backstory and history of the location"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Great lunch food and cute atmosphere. Really enjoyed it! All things on the menu seem to look and taste great! Prices aren't bad either"}
{"text":"Came here for food and drinks with some friends and would recommend as a good place to do so. They have good priced drinks and the bartender serves up a good pour on the liquor.  I had a cup of the spicy crab soup that was fantastic and the catfish sandwich with Cajun fries. My husband had the jerk chicken quesadillas and we both enjoyed our dinner. It is also located in a neat area of town and the building has a lot of history behind it."}
{"text":"This a wonderful neighborhood bar and restaurant!  The type place you can find in Atlanta or other large city.  The food is very good and the service is excellent.  The draft beer selection is good.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place better than I do. First, I love this part of 4th Ward and make it a point to bring out-of-town guests through this neighborhood to show off just how cool Charlotte is with all its hidden gems. But my eating experience at AM was lack luster. The spicy crab soup was very good and I would come back for that. The menu looked wonderful and I didn't know where to begin . . .  so I went for the crawfish burrito cause it read as if it was going to be spicy and flavorful. Not so. All I could taste was the black beans. I took a bite of the London Broil sandwhich and was not impressed. I am still on the look out for a great sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is awesome and the food is even better!! I've had the burgers several times and they are repeatedly phenomenal. That being said, the chicken Pitas, and other sandwiches are great. To be honest, I don't think I've had a bad item at Al Mikes."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Al Mikes.....anytime someone asks me where they should go I send them here. Food is always fresh and cooked to perfection. It's tough to find but worth the hunt."}
{"text":"Substandard food.  The crab soup didn't strike me as anything special, and Im pretty sure it was made with imitation crab.  Along with the soup I ordered the reuben sandwich.  The bottom of the sandwich was already soggy by the time it got to the table.

My fiancé ordered the Beef Stroganoff.  The beef was dry and chewy, the stroganoff sauce seemed lacking in flavor.  The dish seemed kind of watery.

The service was nice, the place was packed.  The restaurant had a nice vibe, but the menu offerings were disjointed, and the vinyl tablecloths were awkward.  I think the restaurant would do well to simplify the menu, and focus a bit more on quality."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed AM yet!!  Thought I had a long long time ago.  Great great spot in the 4th ward.  I wish I had more excuses to go meet people here and drink and eat.

When I used to work downtown I hiked over here (way away from everything downtown) but it is worth it!  If you only have 1hr for lunch... maybe not if you are rushing, but definitely come for dinner or drinks after work.  

There's a really cool \"neighborhood\" feel to this place and everyone is in close quarters, but that's part of the charm of this place.  It's pretty dark and dim at night but it sets a cool mood for hanging out, watching a sports game, or catching up with people over some spirits."}
{"text":"This is one of Charlotte's hidden gems.  

It's not the easiest place to find and it's not the easiest place to park near since there are restrictions on parking on the street depending on the time of day. But it's nice to see history preserved in this area of town.  It's like stepping back into the turn of the century.

Anyway, about Alex Mike's.  The building used to be an old grocery store, now it's a neighborhood pub.  The staff is supper friendly and accommodating.  

The restaurant itself is dark and intimate with wood everywhere, candles on the tables and soft lighting throughout.   Tables are close but you don't feel that you are sitting on top of the next table.

The menu is short but has a several appetizing selections from pasta dishes to sandwiches.  We got there and spent 45 minutes just in conversation and drinking before ordering our meals.  The meal came out within 15 minutes.   

I had the feta chicken which was wonderful - savory chicken on top of a bed of penne pasta with veggies and feta.  The fried pickles appetizer was good as well.  Others in my group tried the sandwiches which were good as well.

I can only hope that Alex Mike's stays open in Charlotte for another 28+ years."}
{"text":"When my parents arrived in town late and said they wanted to eat somewhere close by, I knew this was my chance to finally show them this little 4th Ward hidden gem. And to think, they had proposed a nearby pub.

We went around 8:00 on a Thursday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but the time flew by as we had some beers at the bar. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant, which, with the candlelit tables, felt very intimate.

This was my second time here. I really enjoyed the Feta Chicken last time, and this time I went with the What It Is (blackened chicken breast over fresh rotini in a Cajun cream sauce). It was amazing! The portion was generous and it was just the right amount of spicy. I reluctantly shared some with my parents and they agreed it was heavenly.

This place is perfect for everyone. I was there with my parents and I noticed tables of guy friends, girl friends, and plenty of people on dates. No reason not to check this place out, especially if you live in 4th Ward."}
{"text":"A spot I would come back to for the food and for the atmosphere.   Came in here real quick for lunch and parking was easy, although I could see it getting difficult at times. 

Spicy crab soup.  Get it.  Worth it for sure.  Not too spicy, great taste.  My buddy got London broil sandwich and I got the philly chicken hoagie (on special).  The sandwiches didn't blow my mind but I would come back for other stuff and especially to catch a drink.  Love the location of this too, a real tavern feel."}
{"text":"On a Thursday evening recently, passing through Charlotte, NC, I checked out Yelp and chose Alexander Michael's from the choices available. It was better even than all the positive reviews had led me to expect. And the largely local clientele bore this out.

A local \"gem\" in the shadows of Charlotte's downtown high-rises--in the city's 4th Ward--this saloon has quite a variety of beers on tap to complement their delicious food. I had a Babymaker 2x IPA to wash down my extraordinary \"4th Ward Beef Stroganoff\" on rigatoni. 

The restaurant was crowded and busy but I was greeted as I walked in the door and assured of a table soon, even though I was alone. In fact, the owner noticed that I had parked my car in a no-parking spot, walked out with me, and visually found me a safe place to put my car. When I told him how I came, he said he'd show me a quicker way back to my motel after I'd eaten. An hour later, he kept that promise, seeking me out despite the lingering crowd.  But more amazingly, when I got back to my room I check my email and found a message on LinkedIn, from HIM--informing me that I'd left my credit card behind at the table. How had he found me on LinkedIn? His effort was astonishing. 

Excellent and varied food, good drink, attentive and helpful wait people, and a cheerful crowd combine to make a visit to Alexander MIchael's a special night out and a haven for the traveler at the end of a day on the road. And a memory to renew when visiting Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Alexander Michael's is one of those places I've known about for years but was dumb enough not to bookmark so it would only cross my mind when I was nowhere near the place. Then finally, one day my wife and I were head south from LKN around lunchtime and miracle of miracles, I remembered. Very glad I did!

Really nice homey feeling as soon as we walked in and we were greeted quickly and in a welcoming way. There were many things on the menu that sounded wonderful and she landed on a burger and I had a blackened chicken sandwich which you can also get grilled or teriyaki-style. We felt both were great. In fact, the only thing we tried that was just good vs great was the spicy crab soup. 

The service continued the theme from the nice greeting and our food came out quickly. Al Mike's is absolutely the kind of place any neighborhood would welcome."}
