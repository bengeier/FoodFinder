{"text":"Crepes aren't just for dessert folks.  That's what Dewey Truong, owner of Chococrepe wants you to know.  Yes, they are paper thin, but they aren't as one dimensional when it comes to their meal potential.  Walking into the Queen West restaurant on a hot summer day, the last thing that I wanted to eat for lunch was a Nutella and chocolate smeared crepe, so it's a good thing there was so much more on the menu.
 
Don't let the name fool you.  At Chococrepe, the menu is divided into savoury and sweet options.  So yes, they do offer the obligatory Nutella crepe along with a slew of other sinfully sweet creations, but they also have an impressive selection of crepes with fillings usually associated with sandwiches or wraps.

To start off we had the Pesto ($9.25) which came with egg, mozzarella , pesto and arugula served on a buckwheat crepe.  Now I'm not an eggs anytime of the day person as I lump them into the breakfast only category, so this probably wouldn't be my go to crepe, but it was tasty nevertheless.  The egg was fluffy, the pesto made its presence known without stealing the show, and arugula is never a bad idea. 

All of the savoury menu items come served on buckwheat crepes which are a bit similar to whole wheat wraps in their texture and consistency.  Despite the name though, it's interesting to note that buckwheat is gluten free, so while I can't speak for the filling, the crepe itself is a good option for those who are at least sensitive to gluten.

To round out our savoury options we tried the Country and the Chipotle Chicken (both $9.25).  The Country comes stuffed with cheddar and punctuated with wood-smoked bacon and caramelized pear.  I'm not even a huge fan of bacon (I know...sorry) but I loved this crepe.  The saltiness of the cheddar, the smokiness of the bacon and the sweetness of the pear blended so nicely into a m√©nage a trois of flavour. (What?  It's French...like crepes...)

The Chipotle Chicken though, with a generous amount of tender chicken breast, mozzarella, arugula, and chipotle mayo, might have been the winner, but I like anything that comes served with a side of heat.

At this point it's fair to say we were beyond full, and I was convinced that yes, crepes could be lunch, but it wouldn't be fair of us to ignore the dessert crepes completely.  So we tried two.  The Berry Banana ($8.75) is the Platonic ideal of a dessert crepe.  Covered with sliced strawberries and bananas, then drizzled with dark and white chocolate, it looks like art (think Jackson Pollock).  This crepe had a nice balance of tart, thanks to the strawberries, and sweet, thanks to everything else. 

Our last crepe of the day came in the form of Crunchy Pear ($8.50), also beautiful in design with sliced Bosch pears, a generous sprinkling of crushed almonds, and painted with milk chocolate, it was a bit sweeter than the Berry Banana due in part to the milk chocolate, but won in the texture category.

All of the dessert crepes here are made with the typical sweetened wheat flour and served open-face which gives diners the artistic license to fold, roll, or just dive in as is.  And it just looks prettier.

Oh, and I should mention that all of the crepes are huge, taking up plates that are larger than your average plate.  My suggestion is to bring a friend, or two, and sample multiple crepes like we did.

Did I forget to mention the hot chocolate?  Oh yes, we sampled a couple.  They take their hot chocolate seriously here at Chococrepe.  All flavours are made with melted Valhrona chocolate and you can have your choice of having it made with dark or milk chocolate (and in some cases, white) and with cream or milk. We really wanted to try the popular Fleur de Sel Dulce de Leche made with dark chocolate, but sadly it was unavailable, so we went with the Pumpkin and the Coconut.  The Pumpkin ($5.95) was made with milk chocolate, so as not to overpower the spice and milk instead of its heavier counterpart.  It was tasty, but I would liken it more to a chai latte than a hot chocolate.
The Coconut (also $5.95) however, made with white chocolate and cream was something else.  It was rich without being cloyingly sweet and the coconut flavour came through nicely.  I can definitely see myself going back for one of these once the temperature starts to drop, but if you're craving one now, Truong just installed a brand new air-conditioning system that he's very proud of. 

I would also be remiss not to comment on the excellent service at Chococrepe.  Truong himself is a living doll, and he goes out of his way to make your experience at Chococrepe a memorable one.  He obviously loves what he is doing, and says that he wants eating at his restaurant to be a comfortable and social experience, not to mention a delicious one.  Check, check, and check.

Footnote:  Why doesn't the saying go \"as flat as a crepe\"?  Let's face it, in comparison, the crepes pancake cousin from the West has a bit of a weight problem."}
{"text":"First timer at chococrepe and it was truly delicious. We went for brunch 4 of in total. And we all had an amazing brunch. Tsa, French toast, pork belly Bennie and 
Pulled pork hash and to finsh it off with 2 sweet crepes made to perfection!! Try it out you will not be disappointed.. Awesome service defiantly a gem cafe"}
{"text":"I went here in the middle of summer on a prertty hot day. When I got there I was the only one who was actually in the store. I ordered a dessert crepe but was really sad when I took my first bite. The crepe was cold. I have no idea how it could have been this cold but it was. It tasted terrible. The chocolate they used on the crepe was half decent and may have been better hot, but I could not get through that cold crepe. It was ridiculous considering there were no other orders. 

I would not recommend this place any to anyone. If they serve cold crepes when they are not busy I wonder what they do when they are busy."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!From the fantastic interior to the overly enthusiastic and helpful owners, they have everything a cafe/restaurant should have!The crepes are to die for, I had the brie crepe which was beautiful and great value for money as I was happily full afterwards!I'm not sure if the 'savoury crepe' idea has caught on yet in Toronto but it certainly should as it is a nice light food option&healthy too!Went to R2 afterwards which is also nice but the staff were overly rude&the music a bit weird, doesn't compare in the slightest!GO CHOCOCREPE!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place while in the neigbourhood and looking for a quick snack. Overall, the staff was nice and its quite a decent place. I ordered the Dulce Pear crepe and an orange flavoured hot chocolate. 

I'd say the crepe was only okay, but definitely somewhat over-priced. Either the waitress got my order wrong, but I ended up with a regular hot chocolate, which to be fair was very rich and tasty (dark chocolate). My overall impression is that for the price, I was expecting something better."}
{"text":"Pulled pork hash was very tender and very big!  My bf and I shared this so that we would have room for dessert.  When we got our crepe, it was also very big.  But ate every single piece.  Freshly made and the chocolate was decadent like fine Belgium chocolate ie. godiva or lindt or some other really fancy chocolate."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey crepe ($10) and tiramisu shake ($5). Both were very good, although they were out of my first choice for a shake (pistachio)...will definitely go back this summer.  They have 2 tables near the front window and the rest of the seating is at the back."}
{"text":"When I have been in the UK one of my favourite things was to go to Portabello Market on a Saturday morning and there were always vendors selling Nutella and Banana crepes.  Since being diagnosed with Celiacs and of course living in Toronto I haven't been able to find an option for those awesome crepes.  Well problem solved, Chococrepe offers all sorts of both sweet (Nutella and Banana = nom nom nom) and savoury crepes and for those of us that are Gluten Free they have options that actually taste like a real crepe.  I would highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped into Chococrepe last Saturday night to get two drinks for take out. A green tea hot chocolate and an iced chai latte. There were four female staff members working as well as a couple waiting for crepes and a few other patrons sitting in the back at tables. 

After ordering our drinks we had to wait literally 17mins for our beverages while the staff wandered around like zombies trying haphazardly to complete various drink orders. In this time we waited we noticed how disgusting the the food an beverage prep area were. Dirty dishes all over the counter where the girls were \"trying\" to make drinks, DIRTY rags all over the counters, especially near the crepe stations.

Of course one of the staff went out for a smoke while the others still took forever to make the drinks that they had on order. $11.95 for two drinks at this place, the order was wrong when we got it after waiting 17mins too! Thank Heaven for Starbucks and other cafes that have well trained, friendly staff and follow health codes! 
Never again Chococrepe...not even for something that gets boiled."}
{"text":"All the crepes that my gf and I had were very good.  (We had Chipotle chicken crepe, dark chocolate crepe, and dulce pear crepe.)  The flavor was good.  Chipotle chicken was very tasty and savory.  The crepe was well cooked, just a little bit crispy on the edge.

Hot chocolate was a bit watered down (not enough chocolate).  It could have been richer.  We'll never order it again, definitely not for its current price of $5.95.

No free wifi here in case you're wondering."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place!
First of the service is terrific, the atmosphere is relaxed, plenty of room to sit at and super yummy crepes.
Ive brought my friends and nieces here and will continue to do so.

I can not pick my favourite crepe, there is just so many delicious options. one thing you have to try is their warm apple cider, just the thing on a cold day."}
{"text":"At Chococrepe, the portions were huge and the prices were decent. Great customer service and made us feel at ease being in the environment. I was actually expecting ice cream to come with the sweet crepe that we ordered. But it didn't. And to add ice cream (gelato) to it would be $3 extra. 
We tried the berry banana crepe and also the three cheese savory crepe. The three cheese crepe was okay. It was really cheesy - that I gotta say. The berry banana was like your usual crepe, sweet with bananas, strawberries, and chocolate sauce in it. I came to the setting with high expectation because of the great reviews that I've read, I mean don't get me wrong, the food there weren't bad but it wasn't as phenomenal as I expected it to be. Would've been a lot better with ice cream to satisfy my sweet craving.

I would go back, but not necessarily my first choice for now. Maybe I'll need to try other crepes?"}
{"text":"Did I just wake up from a dream. Because I thought I was in choco heaven. 

Almonds, pear slices, smooth melted milk chocolate drizzled,  plus a scoop of cool vanilla ice cream to round it off, this all came together beautifully for this dessert crepe I ordered at Chococrepe tonight. It was scrumptious.   

Lovely ikea'esk environment to dine in, with bright white oversized mirror and chandelier at the back, white panelling, and soothing aqua / turquoise walled interior. 

The service was prompt and friendly.  

I also liked the fact they give you a big water jug on your table. Because after eating somethings salty/sweet/bitter you'd want to wash it down. Very thoughtful. 

The menu had plenty unique selection for savory or dessert minded folks. In addition to crepes they also have other baked offerings. 

This is now my favorite crepe place. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed! We ordered a milk chocolate cr√™pe asked for some vanilla ice cream to go along with it. We were told and they said that they do not keep ice cream in stock because of the cold weather!  That sounds pretty ridiculous to me - people still enjoy cold treats (especially those paired with warm items) in the fall/winter. 

The crepe itself was nothing special.  The chocolate had a citrus undertone to it which I didn't care for. Plus at 8 bucks it was pretty pricey.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast: tiger shrimp frittata, country crepe gluten free version with Brie, bacon and pear. Friendly service. Too hot to try the hot chocolate, but will next time. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Delish savory and sweet crepes. The owner is friendly and gregarious with an excited but not overbearing demeanor. Hot chocolate with almost any flavor you can imagine! They also have free wifi."}
{"text":"Biting into the Berry Choco Crepe for the first time was like ... biting into a piece of chocolate heaven.   As soon as I tasted the silky smooth and chocolaty of the Valrhona chocolate, it was definitely love at first bite.

When the crepe arrives, forget the fork and knife.  Fold it in half and roll it like a burrito.  That's the best way to enjoy all the flavors melting together.

Love the casual, homey, French bistro-inspired space.   Friendly, knowledgable and accommodating staff make this place a great spot to hang out with friends.

Tong recommends:  Start your evening with Grilled Lemongrass Pork Banh Mi at the Banh Mi Boys and end it with the Berry Choco Crepe at the Chococrepe."}
{"text":"This place is so cute inside! Feels like a French country home. Everything is delicious. The coconut hot white chocolate was so yummy! Never has anything like that before. The crepe was the best I've ever had. The chocolate sauce is beyond this world! They use top notch high quality chocolate from France!  Service was amazing too! If you're in the mood for something sweet and delicious, you gotta come here!!"}
{"text":"You had me a crepe.
But I'll keep coming back because they are actually good!

I was pleasantly surprised by Chococrepe... 5 star surprised!
There were so many crepes to choose from!
...And I didn't order Nutella, but I sure was tempted.

I opted for the Dulce De Leche Pear crepe.
The crepe was super thin and piping hot.
The caramel sauce and pear combo is one of my favourites.
I should have got ice cream too!

The hot chocolate sounded delicious, but I'm waiting for a nice chilly evening before I order a cup.

Awesome spot!  I can't wait to come back for some sweet, sweet chocolate and/or crepe goodness! =D"}
{"text":"I loved the place!

Firstly the service is great and the people working there are very friendly. They cook in front of you are very clean in about doing it.

Secondly their choice of crepe is very good and they all taste great. We tried banana, strawberry, apple and all were good. Then the awesome thing is with their tea selection as they give a giant boxes of various tea bags to choose from.

The place is a little small but not bad to accommodate few groups here and there. I loved their menus as they all had funny quotes from Simpsons...etc on all the menus.

if you are in the area do check it out."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars easily but chococrepe's brunch menu definitely deserves all five stars. My sorority sister and I stumbled upon this place on a shopping extravaganza on Queen street the first week I moved downtown. What captured our attention was the sign on the ground that said \"Lychee White Hot Chocolate\". It sparked our interest and we went inside. 

We ordered the Pulled Pork Hash and the Pork Belly Eggs Bennie and it was amazing. The pouched egg was perfectly pouched and the hash was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The serving was a decent sized portion and was filling. I've had both of these dishes 4 times since! 

I've also tried the chocolate fondue (shared with 4 on a double date), country crepe (bacon and caramelized pears), pesto crepe, nutella crepe and the one with strawberries and banana which were also fantastic. I prefer their savory crepes over the sweet ones though. My boyfriend is gluten-free so we were worried that there wouldn't be many options for him to choose from but many of their savory crepes (and only 3 of their sweet crepes) are gluten free. 

For a first timer, I would recommend the pulled pork hash and lychee white hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Service...Massively lacking, in knowledge, smiles, & any sort of positive attitude. However, wow... The food is amazing! I had a breakfast crepe & got a side of hollandaise sauce, skipped the maple syrup. Delicious! So good in fact I also had a lemon & sugar crepe. A childhood favorite, and also totally delicious. I had a meeting to run to, so I also got a latte to go which was also well made. Total bill including a vitamin water was $23, all in all well worth the quality of food I ate. Also by the time I left the staff seemed to warm up to me. I would definitely go back next time I was craving crepes!"}
{"text":"This spot is sorta in the middle of the a lot of dessert spots. The setup is OK nothing special to write about though I did like the sofa that one can use if ordering take out.
A couple of tables in the front and a few tables in the back. 
I was planning on getting a decaf cappuccino but the mocha caught my eye as it boasted of 64% chocolate from fabled Valrhona. 
As for the crepes there is a sizable list of savory and sweet options. I decided to order the Dulce Pear and mocha. Partner in crime ordered a strawberry version with a drizzle of white chocolate.
Mocha though sizable is way overpriced as didn't do much for me. Didn't have the chocolate taste one expects from a high % coco mix (espresso shot is lost already). 
Crepes are inviting to look at but are average IMO. I did like the batter they use for the crepes as I think they need to add more stuffing. Savory crepes look decent and I might try those instead. Dolce Pear had the pear with skin on! The strawberry one fared better. Nice place to for a made to order dessert though there are some decent options nearby. 
3 Stars."}
{"text":"I like crepes and dessert and this would probably be the best place I've been too. Been here 2 times and both times the crepes were really good as well as crepes and dessert for the other tables looked really well done as well. 

The gelato in a sugar cone was super delicious as well. Many different options.

Interior was very country style homey with bright light and good seating. The music was a bit louder than I would have personally liked but it was too bad. Staff was super friendly and was dressed for the cafe. Very good experience overall."}
{"text":"I want to give them 6 stars. It's the best crepe I've ever had, I swear ta...

I had to admit this, but before coming here I had only ever eaten a strawberry and nutella crepe. Coming here I learned that buckwheat batter is essential and nutella is a joke. I gravitated to fresh fruits and the guy at the counter suggested black and white chocolate (aka dark and white chocolate) and I've never eaten anything so delicious.

It was open-faced, the crepe was super thing, the strawberry and bananas were sweet and yummy. I tried to eat as slowly as possible, trying to enjoy every moment. And I really did enjoy it. The server came back to ask me how it was and we got to talking about crepes and how delicious they are. I liked this place a lot. I miss it. I wish I were in Toronto right now, laying in bed, spooning with a creep, or crepe rather."}
{"text":"Came here last night to catch the Raptors game. 

$5 drink specials - I had fun. :) Asked the bartender to mix me something from bar rail and he brought me back a drink containing three of my favorite ingredients for an alcoholic beverage - cake vodka, amaretto and pineapple (pic with recipe included below). 

Service was fast and friendly. They were attentive but not annoying. Wasn't super busy but I didn't mind. Oscar (owner) was super accommodating about seating us where we wanted. 

Had a bunch of those drinks and also ordered some crepes. I got caramel apple (LOVED) and my date got the berry ones (I didn't like them but I'm picky, he liked them). 

Bartenders were great. At the end of the night, Oscar came over and got us a round of shots and sat and talked for a bit - love when owners take the time to do that. It's good to see they have a vested interest in making sure their clientele are happy. 

This place is fairly new but they're already doing everything right (and I don't say that often, considering I have worked in the hospitality industry most of my adult life, am a business owner myself, and am generally critical). Go check them out. :)"}
{"text":"we were walking along queen west aimlessly looking for a spot to have a snack or light lunch. 
being a group of 4 it was hard to come up with something where everyone will find something to satisfy his/her tastebuds. until we bumped into choco crepe=)) 

they have a very nice menu of sweet and savory crepes and yummy muffins (mmmmmmm salted caramel muffin!!!) 
the choice of crepes is also very interesting - some of the variations I never saw before in other places (salted caramel crepe, cheddar cheese+honey crepe) 
all of them are super yummy!
the background music selection also is very pleasurable and fits the atmosphere nicely. 
the staff is very friendly and didn't get annoyed with our indecisiveness and generally  slow process of choosing our dishes... =)

very satisfied and would definitely stop by again when in this area."}
{"text":"Second last stop in #Adasfoodcrawl

An impromptu stop as my original planned place was closed. They wernt very busy at 4pm on a Sunday. 

We got to sit at the big communal table at the back which was perfect for the group. The place looked like something out of a categloue and what we aspire our kitchena to look like. 

Lots os choice of crepes on the menu. We got the Happy Apple and a simple strawberry with ice cream. The strawberry came wrapped up where as the apple came flat drizzled with chocolate and carmel sauce. 
Both different tastes, but I preferred the strawberry. 

It big enough to share between two or three people. 

Good for groups!"}
{"text":"My friends and I accidentally stumbled in here after dinner as we wanted some place nice to just grab a drink and talk. What attracted my friend was the fact that they had hot chocolate and it looked bright and cozy, so we went in. 

The d√©cor is nice and bright with paintings on the walls. I really like the colour scheme that they chose as it was warm but still fun looking.  

We originally just wanted drinks but the crepes sounded too delicious to pass up. I ordered the Berry Choco crepe as I only wanted a light dessert. It tasted amazing and all my friends loved it too. It was covered with strawberries and white chocolate drizzled on top (you have a choice of dark, milk or white chocolate). Some whip cream and a scoop of ice cream was on top as well. The Berry Choco cost $8.50 and it was an extra $2.00 to add ice cream. I thought it was worth it though. My friend ordered the Country, which is one of their buckwheat crepes. It had bacon, cheese and caramelized pears in it. When she cut it open, you could smell the bacon. I'm not a fan of buckwheat so I didn't try, but my friend liked it. My other friend ordered the Matcha Green Tea hot chocolate and that was so yummy.  

The service was awesome, they always smile and look genuinely happy. We stayed there to talk for a while after our food was done and they did not try to kick us out. They kept replacing the bottle of water when they see we were running low. We also got a free plate of sample brownies, which were yummy as well. 

Overall, we really liked this place and would like to come back. It is the perfect place to hang out with friends and talk. Plus they open late!"}
{"text":"The positive reviews on YELP enticed me to make plans to finally eat at this restaurant last week. Like the keeners we are, my husband and I arrived 5 minutes before it opened. We didn't see anyone inside prepping so we decided to walk around a bit and try again after 12 (when it was scheduled to open). Quarter after 12 there was still no sign of life. Despite our grumbling stomachs we decided to wait out our hunger and come back again later in the day with the hopes that the store would be open. 

Alas! We were finally able to enter the famed Queen Street crepe eatery. We were initially greeted by a very nice and also very apologetic staff member. He explained to us why their store didn't open on time and all was forgiven. Still starving, we ordered our meals straightaway having already studied the menu the night before.

For a beverage I ordered the caf√© mocha. It was served in a very large cup and was very rich and desserty and truly a new favourite of mine. 

For the main I ordered the 3 cheese savoury crepe. This gigantic crepe consisted of goat cheese, swiss cheese, and brie stuffed inside a buckwheat crepe. Buckwheat is really an acquired taste. This gluten free alternative tastes \"earthy\" and has a bitter after taste. For me, I did not mind the taste but I did not love it. The cheese was nice and melty and it really did a good job in masking the underlying buckwheat flavour. The swiss and brie were salty and also slightly bitter which complemented the creaminess and sweetness of the goat cheese. 

Overall, this restaurant deserves a solid 4 stars. Although they were late in opening, the staff members were very kind and remorseful and they had a legitimate reason for their delay. Additionally, we did not wait long for our food and beverages to be made which were both delicious in taste. I will definitely return to this restaurant and next time, I will try a sweet crepe."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this place on a Saturday night around 9pm and the place was completely vacant.  None the less, the decor looked decent and we were craving crepes.  We ordered a dulce de leche (i think) with pears to share.  The pears to my disappointment were not cooked, nor was it ripe we had to to forcibly cut it with our forks and nevermind the texture. This is definitely lack of attention to detail, if the fruit isn't ripe, don't serve it! Dessert crepes to me are not suppose to be hard and crunchy! it should be sweet, smooth, velvety, melt in my mouth sort of thing.  So none the less big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying, I'm actually not a very desert kinda person. I've never really been a fan of crepes. They're too dainty and I like everything meaty and thick.

But anyways, my friends forced me to come here one night.

WE were seated right away at a huge table that was super awesome. The decor inside was phemom. I can't describe it because I'm really bad at describing things.


So I started off with a tea (2.00) and I picked the vanilla bean flavour. OMFG. THAT SHIT WAS SO FUCKING GOOD. But that was just a cup of tea.


My friends and I ordered:

1. THe Tropical Crepe - Banana's, Kiwi's, White Chocolate and Coconut on a huge ass crepe. IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME. My server said that no one really picks that flavour. I was shocked. It was so good. Could've also used a milk chocolate drizzle with the white to make it better, but otherwise its still amazing.

2. THe Nutelle Crepe - Pretty standard fare. Served with a little pot of cream. 

3. The Hot Chocolate (didnt get to try, my friends are rude!)

4. The mushroom crepe - same as #3.


The verdict:

I would rated this 3 stars for the food, because Im not a huge fan of crepes, but I've given it two extra stars because of:

1. AMAZING SERVICE. THATS ONE AND A HALF STARS RIGHT THERE. The waitress was sooooo sweet. And kinda hot. Amazing Accent. But I digress. We were the last ones to leave and they didnt try to kick us out. 

2. The price. In total, we ordered 2 nutella, 1 mushroom, 1 tropical, 1 tea and 2 hot choc and it was lest than 50 bucks. Plz explain."}
{"text":"I kind of love this cute place. 

I ordered the wild brie crepe (Mmm brie, toasted almonds, dried cranberries, honey) and got to try some the 4 cheese and pesto crepes as well. I gotta say my choice was better! I would love it if they offered a small side salad with the savoury crepe (and maybe a little something with the desert crepes). It felt as though the crepe (slightly lacking in some respects) could have added a little something extra. 

I love that this place offers buckwheat as an option for the gluten-free and offers a large variety of Mighty Leaf teas. The ML tea bags are biodegradable and pretty great quality. I'd be very interested to know what kind of ingredients Chococrepe sources. All in all, the food was great and our servers were super friendly and on the ball. 

Lessons learned:
1. Brie makes everything better.
2. I may be a food hoarder of sorts.
3. Attention to sourcing details, like fairtrade tea and in-season ingredients while ignored by some customers are appreciated by many. 
4. This is review 4-0-0. BAM!"}
{"text":"We had a really good server a few weeks back.  he had an english accent. Friendly, warm and helpful.

However, we went today and the service differed alot.  Indifferent staff.  Didn't think service was that good.  The food was standard for what it's worth.  I mean for $5.75 for a lemon sugar crepe it's ok.  I wouldn't say it's a bargain but not too expensive.  Mind you it is sort of small which is standard for crepes.

I dunno, I find the owner there (big dude) isn't really that welcoming to people there.  I think he could be more welcoming to people other than teh ones he deals with but hey that's just me.

They have wifi so ask for the pw."}
{"text":"Pesto - Savoury crepe

Light, fluffy buckwheat crepe
lovely taste of pesto ... 

Berry Banana - Sweet crepe - recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times, love the food, but this place does not stand out too much that I would write a review for it. After trying their dulce pear crepe, it is now my second favourite crepe place in downtown Toronto.

Food:
I have tried the country, pesto and chipotle chicken savoury crepes here. They were good, better than most crepe places actually, but what really struck me was the dulce pear crepe. The last time I went I wanted to get something sweet, and decided to go for the dulce pear crepe after reading recommendations on yelp. 
OMG, it was so good that I feel like my tongue betrayed my all-time favourite crepe place (Cr√™pes √† GoGo). You might know the taste of pear, you might have tried dulce de leche, but the combination of both gives this really simple, yet interesting and refreshing taste. It has this kiddish and happy taste to it. My friend who went with me thought that there was something wrong with me every time I took a bite (when you're so happy you want to smile, but you don't want to stop chewing, not a great look). I had dulce de leche today and I cannot stop thinking about their dulce pear crepe.

Place/Atmosphere/Service:
It is a really cute place, a good place for an afternoon snack by yourself or to catch up with friends. Services were good and waitresses were really friendly. For the 3 times i have been there, they have good music. The blue they used on the walls is very soothing and calming. 

PS. All the paper wrappers they used to keep the napkin and cutlery together are embossed with their logo."}
{"text":"It's rare that an eatery will surpass your expectations, but Chococrepe has. Recently I went there to converse with a friend over tea. We ordered tea from their wide selection and never felt pressured to buy anything else. I decided to try one of their sweet crepes. Having been diagnosed with gluten intolerance 6 months ago, I asked if they would place their sweet filing not in a desert crepe but in a buckwheat crepe, so as to avoid triggering my intolerance. The staff went a step further and explained that a new gluten free crepe had been placed on the menu. I decided to try the gluten free crepe with nutella and strawberries. I didn't know what to expect as sometimes gluten free food isn't very tasty. In fact this gluten free crepe was delicious and tasted like any crepe that could be bought in Montreal or Paris. It was the perfect thinness and worked perfectly with the sweet nutella and strawberries. The service I found to be very good and when we exited, we were thanked for our service in a way that made me feel the staff were genuinely happy that we had been there. That sort of service can be in short supply in the service industry. I will definitely return to Chococrepe."}
{"text":"My friends and I weren't excited about dessert options at Mavrik, so after dinner, we wandered around looking for somewhere to sit down for dessert. However most dessert places in the area, like Nadege or Dufflet or Dlish cupcakes, close early so we were stuck. Luckily, we stumbled upon this place which has just been open ~2 weeks. We were immediately drawn the the bright display of tarts and the cheery robin's egg blue and white decor. Our server was patient and sweet, and they have a survey that they encouraged us to fill out at the end. It seems that since they are just opening, they really value customer feedback. 

We shared a strawberry and dark chocolate sauce crepe, which is served open-face instead of the usual folded version, with fresh whipped cream. Yummy and great for sharing! We all had to try their hot chocolate. This is hot chocolate taken to another level... No syrups or powders are used. It's all valrhona chocolate from France. You can customize your hot chocolate by choosing: 2% milk or cream, milk or dark chocolate, and flavour (e.g. vanilla, green tea white chocolate, chili, dulce de leche, mint...). At $5.99 per mug, it's steep, but it makes for a nice treat to savour slowly. 

A welcome addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Chococrepe looks like a cute bakery shop when you first walk in, but with seating and really good service in the back.  I love the cute decor; turquoise with accents of brown and cute artwork.  Turquoise is my favourite colour so it was an instant appeal for me.

I've never been a fan of savoury crepes, but Chococrepe has changed my mind after I tried their turkey crepe and chicken chipotle crepe.  I went with a bunch of friends so we were able to share a few different types of crepe.  I would recommend this place as a brunch place, but would also be good for lunch or dinner as their savoury crepes were tasty and filling.  Chococrepe has changed my perception of crepes as a meal rather than just a snack or breakfast item.  My only suggestion is to have more filling that is more evenly distributed.

Their basic banana berry crepe drizzled with chocolate hit just the right spot as well.  We also tried their salted caramel brownie and triple chocolate brownie, which perfectly satisfies that chocolate craving."}
{"text":"Whew! This cute and comfortable crepe factory will tempt you like the Devil incarnate. My \"Old Mushroom Delight\";The most savourful crepe in Crepe history had me begging for more and wishing they delivered. All the entree or \"savourful\" crepes incorporated chocolate; With mushroom, eggplant or just a plain old chocolate crepe. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this two stars and not one because the food was not terrible and because the girl at the bar/espresso machine area/behind the counter was friendly and nice and made our interactions feel welcome.

Came in here with my boyfriend on a Sunday, at 6:25 PM for a quick bite. I mention the time because this will be important later. We stroll in for some coffees and crepes, we needed something quick since we wanted to catch a movie after.

Anyway, I notice their sign outside says Sunday, closed at 7 PM. I say great, that's perfect timing because we have to be out by 7. I come to the counter and one of the girls smiles and my nicely and I glance at their menu on the chalk board on the top of the back wall. Immediately this other serious looking lady comes up to us and says they close at 7 PM and it is now 6:30 so... I say 'okay, well its 6:26... and we just want some crepes...\" (this isn't a fine dining experience with a 3 course meal). She is so stand offish, she just didn't want to serve us. So I start losing my patience, and ask her, \"can you serve us or no...?\" She says sure but you have to be out by 7. I said we have to be out by 7 since we have a place to be (but thanks for the politeness). Anyway, my boyfriend sounded like he just wanted to eat something quick, so I decided to just let it go and not get into it with the rude waitress and just order quickly and try to enjoy the time together.

She came up, didn't say anything, sat us and put down menus. Then she came back and asked for our orders, I let my boyfriend order first, and to speed things up and 'help' her time concerns I said I would order the exact same thing (crepe and a regular coffee). She still asked me if I wanted anything different, or what I meant by the same. I'm pretty sure, the same means equal... but anyway, she asked anyway as if I wasn't clear enough with my simple and plain order.

She came back shortly after taking our order, harshly placed the glass bottle of tap water in between us, said nothing, put down two glasses and left. She later came back with cream&milks and the sugar, again saying nothing, no eye contact and left. Same thing occurred with the food plates.

In regards to the food... let's see the crepe was alright, I got the chicken chipotle crepe which came with some sort of mini salad made up of bruised greens, tossed in a balsamic dressing - sort of underwhelming since by now the experience was ruined by this waitress having the worst night of her life apparently, caused by customers walking into the crepe place 35 minutes before closing time. Coffees were fine too. Wouldn't come back solely because this waitress handles clients like she's been sucking on a lemon all day and she happens to hate lemons.

Anyway, she didn't even bother picking up our plates, she disappeared into the kitchen, and left the kind girl behind the bar/counter to come and pick up our plates. We were done, paid and out the door by 7PM. 

My advice to all, there are plenty of other crepe places or even coffee shops where you can have a great time and wonderful service, all along Queen St. If you end up here, I really hope you don't get served by this waitress. Good luck to you. Never have I felt so unwelcome and like I was bothering someone so much by my being there, not sure if maybe she was just following directions and the owner has advised her to 'shoo away' all customers trying to come to the establishment 30 mins before close, or if maybe the owner just need to explain that this isn't proper customer service and her 'tips' and her wage are being paid for her to serve and welcome paying customers. Isn't that part of the job description?

Ps: Keep the girl behind the bar/counter - she knows how to handle people."}
{"text":"Is it just me or if you want to get a quick fix all there is around Queen and Bathurst is poutine, a pizza pizza, Ghandi's and high priced restaurants? (416 is the exception but it's more of a snack and less of a meal plus constantly packed).  I was running around for Canadian Music Week, so Chococrepe with the light at the end of the tunnel. 

VIBE 
Light and bright like a cute little kitchen you'd stumble upon! Le Love. 
There's a gilded mirror and chandelier in the back with a bigger table for groups. The servers (okay, one of them) are like a dream out of an Anthropologie ad. Nice, friendly and quick. The patrons that sat beside me were really nice too and we had a conversation. 

THE GOODS 
Sweet and Savoury are on the menu. There are a good amount of overpriced hot chocolates. (I get it. Rent has to be paid.) I had the chipotle chicken crepe with arugula. The chipotle mayo was a bit spicy and I wasn't super full but it was satisfying. The neighbour had the strawberry chocolate crepe, which comes with a vanilla cream sauce that you pour over the crepes (another note: they're not folded). He enjoyed it. I'll probably have that next time I'm in. 

A note: they have specials on the chalkboard above the cash when you walk in. My server didn't tell me of the specials. Though I was in a protein mood, I would have liked to have to had the three cheese crepe. It seems that cheese is lacking from the menu on the savoury crepe side. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
A nice, colourful addition to the Queen West nabe. 
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Some great crepe selection..and I had the pumpkin chocolate milk..if you love pumpkin it's great but I think some other choices might be a better option for a chocolate milk. Overall good place and great atmosphere..I'll be back to try the goat cheese and pear crepe next time!"}
{"text":"Cr√™pes are good but super skinny. Nice for an early breakfast or a light snack, but don't expect to walk out full."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday to partake of crepes, hot beverage and conversation. I ordered the hot chocolate, billed as the best in Toronto. I took it light, dark chocolate base with a hint of cinnamon. Definitely amongst the better ones! Not overly sweet but neither was it watery.

I ordered the brie crepe. I must confess, I have a fondness for Cafe Crepe. I found Chococrepe's selection lacking. I also did not like the buckwheat taste - yikes, I guess I want a sinful pleasure that will go straight to my waistline!

Our service, though, was fantastic! The server delights in his job and wanted to ensure we were most satisfied. He was so cute and lovely, that I wanted to take him home!

All in all, I give it 3 stars because the service and hot chocolate more than compensated for the crepes."}
{"text":"Let it be known that sex is overrated, by comparison to a good crepe!!!

  I tasted the sublime and other worldly pleasures of the Dulce Pear crepe and my tastebuds are still reeling from the afterglow...to the point that my husband's so sick of hearing about it!

Get your ass to Chococrepe NOW!!!*

*Apologies for the gratuitous use of exclamations, but it's imperative that one should try Chococrepe, trust...you will love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes!

I wandered in here and couldn't decide on which savoury crepe I wanted to eat. I finally went with the \"breakfast\" crepe - a giant buckwheat crepe stuffed with eggs, cheddar and ham and served with maple syrup for dipping and a side salad.

The crepe arrived looking somewhat like a giant quesadilla. It was big! Very tasty.

Both waitstaff were extremely friendly and were quick and made sure to check I was enjoying my meal. 

Bistro-y casual decor with take out counter and decent amount of seating. 

I foresee many future visits in order to try pulled pork crepe, mango chicken crepe and some of the sweet ones too."}
{"text":"I really liked the multiple choices for hot chocolates they have and for their crepes with some really original combinations. Service is nice, place is calm and not overcrowded. I will come back for sure (and they serve the crepes on a plate and not in a paper and with a small side salad for the salty ones, made with buckwheat flour).

Only negative is that everything was served just warm rather than hot.

will go back, almost for sure!"}
{"text":"Simple review , Awsome crepes great service even close to closing and great Cappuccinos!  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love Chococrepes!

Nice cute decoration!

Nice cute Wait staffs!

Nice cute crepes!

Just love everything at Chococrepes....

The only complain maybe the size of that crepe, since I have no one to share, I ended up stuffing my face with that.. and I ended up having carbs overdose!

I love Chococrepes!"}
{"text":"Chococr√™pe is quaint little cr√™perie. Butter flour batter cr√™pe is generally used for the sweet dessert cr√™pe. The restaurant will also substitute it for savory cr√™pe if you are a weak sauce buckwheat hater like my friend. Chococr√™pe is not a bad option if you are in the area. I just wish the cr√™pe was lighter and crisper like Cr√™pe A Gogo. On the other hand, Chococr√™pe is more spacious than some of its counterparts! More room for chitter chatter...gossip better! ;) 

Instead of sugar, Chococr√™pe used $30 per kilogram Valrhona chocolate in their hot chocolates. The chilli cayenne hot chocolate was good. The spiciness was just right. The heat hit the throat instead of the mouth. It was frothed beautifully!  The drink was not homogenous. There were residual dark chocolate bits at the bottom of the mug. It was still a decent drink over all! 

Chococr√™pe has a promotion on dine.to for $10 for hot chocolate and cr√™pe till the end of March."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Coming from Germany and went numerous times to France I really appreciate a good cr√©pe. And our 'Canadian Breakfast' was delicious. Very nice and helpful waiter."}
{"text":"The 10 year old boy in me still loves hot chocolate and this is mecca.  There are an insane number of choices - I had lychee, tried pumpkin but loved the peppermint.  The crepes themselves are the best in the city; frankly the best I've had anywhere but France.  Its a rich option but what an indulgence.  Love it.

The atmosphere is plain but fresh, with French pastel colors and simple decorations.  They are closing down in January 2014 to renovate the space - I look forward to seeing what they do with it."}
{"text":"I first came in here for a coffee $2, which was really nice and light.

The second time was to try their hot chocolate with \"melted Valhrona chocolate\" $5.95, sounds good doesn't it??

I had the light, milk chocolate, traditional. It was a giant mug of yumminess, and lots of sweet. This wasn't as sweet as my friend's rich, dark  chocolate, also tradition (way too sweet for me).

I love the atmosphere, love taking friends here for a coffee date, GREAT service!, and it's a cute place. NO I haven't tried their crepes yet but am dying to!"}
