{"text":"Went there last Saturday night for a beer and tired to order a burger. The burger came  with a bacon sauce. That didn't sound good to me so I asked if  I can get mayonnaise instead of the bacon sauce. The girl at the bar said no, You can get the burger with out any dressing but we can't substitute. I finished my beer and left.

Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Maybe the beer is awesome here I don't know. I mean you can get good beer just about anywhere. I love beer, but I might love food more and this is not a place for foodies. I ordered a med well Gruyere burger it came out dry as sawdust. The fries were so over done we asked them for a new basket and they were still just too dry. They tasted like they  were frozen. My co-diner said the burger was like  chewing an old dish sponge. I was so disappointed because I was getting over a hang over and I just wanted something tasty after a whole day of tummy aches. Well I ended up puking up that burger later because of the hangover, but I think more because my body could feel my regret. I shall never step foot in that place again. Sorry I know all the cool kids love it but I prefer places with good food over beer."}
{"text":"After confusing all of the checks at our table, they demanded to see the IDs of everyone at our table as we prepare to pay and leave.

Considering the price of the beers and that their food is nothing unique, this is a place I will not come to again. It's one thing to mix up an order, but it's another to be carded twice after they make a mistake. 

Also, their misters (which run even on nights that are not hot) absolutely drench the tables and everyone sitting under them. After multiple requests, the workers were unable to find a single towel to dry off the table."}
{"text":"Tons of beer if that's your thing... full bar too.  No cocktail menu to speak of, and only a few food items on the menu.  Felt like kind of a basic, no frills place, which can be a good thing sometimes.  

We were there in late December at night and all the doors were open with no heating... not sure why that was, but wear a coat if you're going to hang out indoors here in the cooler months.  Freezing cold, tried using the candles on the table to keep warm, not so efficient... so we only stayed for one drink and bounced."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  I've been here several times, and now to find out they are featured as worst offender on channel 5's dirty dining.  Be very careful where you eat and drink"}
{"text":"I absolutely dug this place.  A very modern bar with an outside bar and seating area was perfect company to the awesome weather.  The decor was pretty cool too.  Can't wait to go back!  The bar manager was also very welcoming and pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here with a colleague for a break during our programming homework.  Tyler was absolutely amazing! The beer selection was fabulous and the food was stellar!  We cannot wait to come back, the 18th is a sierra nevada take over- so excited! I am definitely trying the quinoa salad, the quinoa burger was ridiculous! Definitely recommend it!!!  So were the fries and Thai ketchup and tomato basil aioli. Heard the southern fried chicken sandwich is great too. Just come!!! It's definitely worth your while!"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open but when I got there I was so disappointed. First off, do not call this place a hipster bar, it's far from it. A hipster bar does not sell beer for $10. It sells PBR Tallboys for $1. Second, the food is horrible, got the pretzel and cheese. Just sick. Third, the service was a bunch of assholes. My friend tried to come in after work and she had a different bars logo on her shirt with a zip up over it and they wouldn't let her in. I'm sorry but she was coming in to support your bar, now you guys just seem like a bunch of pricks, and will no longer get service from any of us. Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Our waitress was \"Katlan,\" who was really prompt and friendly. She had a great knowledge of all the different drinks and beers. We'll definitely go back next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I went out with some friends. I only give one star because the servers did an okay job. If it wasn't for that, I would say \"I wish I could of given 0 stars\". One of my friends got sick and was throwing up in the bathroom. The bouncers were yelling at her and kicked her out with even offering to call her a taxi. If I remember correctly, they have to offer a cab ride by law to people that are too drunk to stay. They were rude the entire time. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"I was here for the opening night, and I've returned semi-regularly ever since. The beer selection is satisfying, the layout of the bar is great (with both indoor and outdoor options), and the staff are generally very friendly and helpful. Yes, the beer is overpriced (a pint is not a pint here, I'm afraid), but I tend to overlook that. There is one thing, however, that is quite impossible to overlook.

TURN DOWN THE MUSIC.

Not just a little bit. Down by half, please.

It is simply not possible to have a conversation without getting hoarse. Last night I brought a decently large group here. We spent around $150 in a fairly short period of time, and would have spent another $150 IF WE COULD HAVE CARRIED ON A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SHOUTING. We asked various members of staff repeatedly if they could please turn down the music, and we got the same (very sympathetic) response every time: \"we all agree that the music is way too loud, but the owner keeps coming in and cranking up the volume.\"

So we left, walked down to Tops, and spent our $150 there.

Some people have tried to apologize for the stultifying volume of the music at this place by pointing out that the bar is catering to a college-age crowd. WE were both (a) COLLEGE-AGE and (b) a CROWD, and the volume of your music drove us and our money right out the door.

Owner-Person: you are patently nuts. We understand. But you would do well to listen to your customers, and your very friendly staff. In fact, you should listen very attentively to your staff, since they're the ones that will soon be filing claims with OSHA concerning their hearing-loss."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed! Anyone who knew this is a new product from Julian Wright's family ( owner of Canteen + la bocca + handlebar) would expect at least minimum service at this new bar, but ironically this bar is AWFUL at service. It took the waitress 20 min to attend us ( they were soo busy with their girl talk near their booths), we got our beers after 10 min and that was it. We didn't see them until after 30 minutes even after making constant eye contact and as a desperate attempt I had to whistle, got our check and left! RUINED my date night:-( . We felt like our business is not appreciated at all! There are a lot of friendly bars on Mill Ave. ...Handlebar and Julian Wright, you can do better than that!"}
{"text":"Love to wait? Come to Handlebar! From the moment we sat at the bar the bartender seemed arbitrarily pissed off. After an extremely thorough examination of our IDs he reluctantly agreed to take our drink order. The burger I ordered was $10 and comes on a bun that I recognize from my grade school cafeteria and no side. I had to really flag down the bartender to ask for my check, which never came. I had to ask another person behind the bar to final get a check delivered. Not compelled to darken the doorway at Handlebar ever again."}
{"text":"The menu is a bit limited, but the beer list is extensive. I've had a brawt and a burger here, both accompanied by fries and I'm yet to be disappointed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about beer, so feel free to ask for recommendations. The beer cheese dip is pretty damn fantastic, so be sure to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Neato, bike-themed, Hipstery pub in the heart of Mill Avenue. Some tasty brews are to be had (Stiegl is wonderful, though they tend to run out fast, so Krombacher has become a favorite), as is some way-better-than-your-average bar food. There are some nice veggie options, including the Quinoa Burger, which might be one of the best damn sandwiches on the planet. They have a savory grilled cheese sandwich as well, and their \"bakery fresh pretzels\" with beer cheese are the best I've had so far. The place is never dead, even on Sunday nights. Good atmosphere - a bit heavy on the sports (not my thing at all) but better than a lot of places. When there isn't some important game on, they've always got good music being piped in (classic alt favorites like Smiths, Talking Heads, etc., mixed with contemporary alt/indie rock). Good times indeed!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go here it looks so cool and different. So my friend and I went today sat outside it was a while before anyone helps us and when someone did we order out drinks and he ask for my Id so I gave it to him as he bent my iD I asked him what he's doing he said its fake I said no its not I'm about to be 23 so I pull out my passport id (I carry it everywhere with me) and gave him that. And he started bending that one as well and said its fake. I'm was getting upset. And said no its not as he rudely cut me off and said \" were strict down here\" I said really I've been down on mill before and never had a problem. (Even when I was under age and had a fake ID.)  so we said never mind we don't want to drink as he said good because I can't serve you. So we start to order I ask for a salad no radish he said what no radish I said yes and my friend said he wanted a burger with Fry's as the guys rudely rolled his eyes and said we don't have Fry's. so we got up and left!! I'm never going back there again!!!"}
{"text":"SIX dollar 12oz pour of Bells Two Hearted.. uh, I think not. Usually poor service, distracted bartenders who don't look around. Too bad cause the atmosphere is great and they have a nice patio, one of the few places I like to hang out on Mill."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my friends last night home before deployment. The bouncers were extremely rude, took my friends  state and military ID and told us we had to chase down the PD to get his ID's verified and approved. After spending some time with the police exchanging all the necessary information the bouncer let my friend in. 

It's too bad the bouncers suck, bc the place is pretty cool."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant/bar on a Sunday afternoon. The very best part of this place is their beer selection and prices of the beer during happy hour. I like the atmosphere of this place- not pretentious at all. The menu leaves a lot to be desired, but its more about the beer then the food. We had the batter fried cod and subbed sweet potato fries for reg fries- our buddies split a burger- it is mostly burgers & brats on the menu. Both meals were decent but nothing to write home about. The service was outstanding- our red-headed server, I think his name was Tyler was head and shoulders above any server I've ever had. Just a really likable character and he was there when we needed him without being intrusive. he seemed to really like his job. (which you don't see too often). I would defintitely return to this place (good location too!)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes because of the owner's history.  (I love La Bocca)  We went here last Saturday evening.  It was the only place we passed on Mill Ave. that was not jam-packed.  That should have been a big clue not to go in, but we really wanted to check this place out.  
     The beer seems over-priced; 12 oz. beer for the price of 16 oz. at comparable places, and the selection was not impressive.  As for the food, quite bluntly, it sucked!  We had a burger, brat and split the large fries.  (We wanted a pretzel, but they were out!  They supposedly make them \"fresh\" daily, but were out since Friday night.  Hmm, couldn't make any today???)    The burger and brat had no taste what so ever.  Very disappointing.  The fries were good, but the \"large\" is served in a paper  pouch the same size as a Small fries at McDonald's.  Seriously, this is a Large??????
     We were going to check this place out sooner or later.  I'm glad it was sooner.  I won't be back, and I'm shocked at the positive reviews of this place.   What else do these people like, Applebee's???"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place while exploring Mill Ave for some cocktails. The place appeared to have room at the bar and looked very inviting. Definitely a cool looking place with a beautiful patio. We sat ourselves at a table that I could barely rest my arms on cause they were pretty tall and was promptly greeted by a pretty waitress.
I ordered the Old Fashioned ($8) while my bf ordered the Moscow Mule (also $8). We also ordered a \"large\" portion of the sweet potato fries ($5) 
My drink was VERY strong with little taste of any bitters. I would have preferred to have a better blended drink but having it be strong was good enough for me. My BF liked his drink, it seemed to be better blended.
The big disappointment was the sweet potato fries, which stinks cause I love sweet potato fries normally. I feel like we got all the little crumbs left behind before they made a fresh batch. It did come with two dipping sauces which were good, especially the tomato basil. My BF said the BBQ sauce was a bit spicy but he liked it. We couldn't even really enjoy the sauces so much cause the fries weren't even fries just (very) salty crumbs that I ended up trying to use a utensil to eat cause we paid money for them and I was determined to eat them, I eventually gave up. My BF wanted me to return them cause they were such a joke but I just couldn't bc I work in the industry and know that annoyance. 
We wanted to try a burger or something cause we were so hungry but after the disappointing fries we decided against it.
I'm sure the fries aren't always that bad but for us it was a big turn off. 
If you want strong drinks (lots of beer options too) in a hip bar on Mill Ave with lots of TVs and space to sit down and you're not very hungry, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Was great for a company mixer that encompassed 95% of the bar, until 10pm and they decided to blast their ridiculously loud music. 60 people decided to leave."}
{"text":"Candice is awesome. She was attentive and very sweet. 

Food is always great! I always get the grilled cheese but maybe next time I'll try something else. The basil dipping sauce with the sweet potato fries is mainly what gets me coming back. 

I've never had a bad experience here. 
*knocks on wood*"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place after seeing it featured in a food magazine. I don't know why the magazine chose this establishment because it isn't that awesome. Fact: it sucked. 

The service was horrible because we hardly had any. It took about 20 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for the food to come out. My girlfriend's order was wrong, and mine took an additional 10 minutes after hers and my sister's came out. 

If only the food were good. Their brats were flavorless, and their buns fell apart too easy. The only delicious thing was the Thai ketchup. Everything else was mediocre to average at best. You could probably make it better yourself. 

I wanted to like it because the atmosphere/environment is interesting/hip (in an urban hipster way) and it has the same owner as La Bocca, which I love. It's just... I wasn't drunk enough to think any of it was worth it."}
{"text":"Was excited to go there for a tap takeover of one of my favorite breweries.  There was no tap list, which is not a problem, except the waitress and bartender didn't really know what beers they had.  The waitress did write some of them down for us and was really nice about it.  The bartender talked to me like I was about to try my first beer...I'm no expert, but I know the difference between a sour and a porter, thank you.  Ended up ordering a favorite beer of mine and turned out it was nitro (I'm not a fan of nitros).  Seems like something you might mention before pouring.

Overall, the staff was nice, though clearly lacking some basic beer knowledge.  I had planned to stay for a few drinks and left after one.

A little beer education can really go a long way."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE AT THE ENTRANCE. After we arrived at the bar (first stop of the night). The IDIOT at the door wood not let me in because when he asked me how I was doing I said \"barely making it how about you\" and smiled. He told me I cannot say that to a bouncer. I said it was a joke....to that he replied....and I quote again....\"its like saying BOMB at the airport\" and that he cannot let me in because I look to drunk....I guess I must look drunk all the time since I just walked over from the parking lot. Anyway I told my nine friends that we are leaving and we went to CASA...way better service much better bouncers...."}
{"text":"This is the best new bar on Mill.

Mill is not really my scene, but my friends dragged me out to this place one night and I've been a fixture there practically every weekend since.  

First night there we were there early so we had dinner.  The brats and fries are AMAZING!  The fries are tossed in garlic and are thick and crispy. Soo good!  For drinks I ordered the Paper Route which is THE BEST THING EVER.  It's a can of PBR, shot of Jameson, and a cigarette all for 7 bucks.  

I can't say enough great things about this place, however they did mess up my friend's tab one night.  When she went to close out they said she already had even though she hadn't.  She goes home and checks her bank account and she was charged $47 even though she had only had a couple drinks.  They did the right thing and reimbursed her, and since it didn't happen to me it's not going to affect my rating.  Just an FYI."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick drink and dinner ! Great service the grilled cheese was so cute in the shape of a heart  will be back! I believe our servers name was Gail if I read the receipt correctly"}
{"text":"Honestly the atmosphere is chill, but the service is awful.  My husband & I  ventured over to The Handlebar & Grill on a Thursday night around 8:30 and the place was busy but not near full.  We opted to sit on the patio and had to wait more than ten minutes for a server to come over to our table.  While we were waiting the tables on either side of us were being helped, and we continually tried to wave over the server who persistently ignored us. There were multiple servers working, but they appeared to be gathered in a group in the corner talking to one another and hanging with their friends.  After someone finally came and brought us menus another ten minutes passed before we received our beers.  After sipping our beers we decided to order some food, but our server never returned,  After finishing our beers and our entire craft of water we spent another twenty minutes attempting to flag down servers (because ours disappeared) and ended up just getting our check.  We had high hopes for this place, but it was a huge disappointment.  Maybe with more mature employees this place will be successful, but in it's current state there are much better quality places to go on mill ave."}
{"text":"The Handlebar and Grill is my most favorite place to go on Mill Ave in Tempe.

I have been here on a busy Friday and Saturday night and I have been here on a laid back, slow Wednesday night. Every time I go I am never disappointed There's great music (usually acoustic, never house music, and often no lyrics but still upbeat), great atmosphere (lofted ceilings and wooden benches make the place so much more open and the lighting by mason jar candles is awesome), and good looking guys (seriously every time I go there's plenty of eye candy.

What I love most about Handlebar is how laid back and refined it is compared to places like Que or Canteen. Handlebar knows it's not a club and it's ok with that. THe open air patio and bar area make it intimate enough that you could still go here on a Friday night after a date for drinks or a Friday night with friends to rage.

The drinks are a tad pricey, but they're great. I have only had one item on the menu that was the pretzels. For $6 you get 3 huge stick pretzels with beer cheese and spicey honey mustard dipping sauce. More than enough for one person, these treats are amazing. Really doughy, soft pretzels and the beer cheese tastes like it was just poured out of the can. Ugh, so good.

I don't have to say whether I'm coming back here or not because I am."}
{"text":"Just wandering around Phoenix, ended up in Tempe, found a parking spot, wandered and stumbled into the Handlebar.  It's a nice joint.  Kinda college-y but then ASU is across the street.  Love Tempe and now I love this bar."}
{"text":"Beer selection good but service was really slow and it seemed that the majority of the bar patrons were fellow co-workers drinking. Pretzels and beer cheese also good."}
{"text":"Like I like your brown bag deal because I enjoy Popsicles but I have to recommend that you break up the beer/shot/treat because all at once it is an overwhelming scenario of flavor stimulus"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have enjoyed each experience. The servers are friendly and attentive, they play good music (Smiths seemed to show up a lot), and the beer selection is great. Wednesday was Happy Hour all day, and the discount was better than we expected. 

For the vegetarians in your group, they offer a really delicious quinoa burger- highly recommend! The pretzel with cheese is also amazing, and the grilled cheese is probably the best I have had anywhere (sorry mom).

We don't like sports bars with TVs on every wall, so Handlebar was a nice compromise- people could watch the game but it did not take over the entire establishment."}
{"text":"Down in Tempe to move our daughter to ASU...needless to say, that entitles us to a few drinks!  Hubby and I were greeted immediately  and carded when we ordered a couple of beers...for the record, hubs has a grey goatee and my grey is colored at the salon.  I was refused since I didn't have my ID (I'm 50!! And certainly do not look like a 20yo).  Hubs still ordered a Coors Light but 10 minutes later, no beer.  Not busy, 2 bartenders standing around and to top it off, another couple (I think looked younger) came in, sat at bar and was NOT carded?!?!  WTF??  We got up and left.  I appreciate  the need to be cautious and card to verify ages but seriously??  Won't be back and based on the other YELP reviews, we didn't miss much..."}
{"text":"Awesome burger and amazing fries. Beer selection is solid too. Needs more beers from the Pacific Northwest though!!"}
{"text":"This is my love note:

Yours beers are so delicious, your food is absolutely scrumptious.  I wish I could spend forever and always with you.  If I could just never work and sit inside of you all day eating and drinking, why, I think I would be the happiest gal on this side of the Mississippi River.  You are great, don't change, and please, stay with me forever and always.

I love you to the moon and the stars Handlebar,

{"text":"I usually like the Handlebar they have good food and a nice variety of beer. However, I went over the weekend with a friend and our waiter was so annoying I don't even want to go back."}
{"text":"We love this place on mill! Its very chill place where you can have a drink and relax! Then I think at night it has a DJ? But always go in the day and sit on the patio. They have great food. Not many choices of food but they ones they got is all you need! It's an outdoor and indoor bar/restraint located to all the other ones but this one is clean and not the same old same old! I say try it out bc its one of our favs."}
{"text":"They always have such a huge selection of beer and it's a quieter alternative amidst all the Mill bars. They're never super busy even Friday and Saturday nights (it's too tame for all the wild college kids lol) They usually have a DJ on Saturday nights. I've had the food and it's food. Nothing great or terrible there. I normally go for a few drinks with friends and to people watch. The bartenders are friendly enough, but don't expect them to chit chat. It gets a bit loud after 10, but the outside patio is usually pretty quiet. It gets crazy packed when there is a game and there's no chance at getting a table though. All in all a nice, easy bar in the middle of Mill."}
{"text":"I have visited The Handlebar at least a few times a month since they opened last year.

They have an awesome beer selection. During happy hour, many of the beers are half price. (Beers used to all be half price during happy hour, but that has changed, so be sure to confirm with your waitress/waiter that a particular beer is included in happy hour pricing.) And, as another reviewer stated, The Handlebar serves less than 16 ounce pours of beer. :(

They have great burgers and brats (and other sausages). The fries are great. And, they've recently added great fish and chips that I like better than those from the couple of Irish pubs in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really?! Serve us a RAW burger and think nothing is wrong with that?! Will not be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Female bartender  was the worst bartender Iv had on my drive from fl to California..been on the road partying every night and she couldn't stop yaking away with some guy while we were coming to get food she took so long we decided jimmy johns was obviously a better option, we got drinks and should have gave her 0 as a tip but we didn't. Worst bar on the 2600 mile drive so far"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink while I was visiting family. Classy digs for sure - liked the feel inside, have to say I liked the bar. Would recommend visiting, and will definitely try again, but for now I'm only leaving 3 stars, and here's why:

1. Staff was SLOW AS A SNAIL getting drinks. Sure it's a busy Saturday, but my brother ordered a Delirium, and sure the keg was tapped, but it took 10 minutes for the girl to come back and say \"we're working on it.\"
2. Overly obnoxious and overly intoxicated students - don't get me wrong, I've been there myself. But these kids were so loaded, I would have seen them get kicked out of any reasonable bar. Honestly, surprised there wasn't a fight!!
3. Bathroom's weren't incredibly clean. Not bad enough to scare me away, just not up to par.

I visit Tempe often, and WILL ABSOLUTELY RETURN FOR ANOTHER VISIT!! The experience wasn't enough to keep me away, but it was enough to make me skeptical...."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised this place only has 3.5 stars. The beer selection is awesome, and I love the vibe. Long tables inside and an open sitting area on the patio. 

Instead of beer I had a Mexican Mule, so the tequila version of a Moscow Mule-- delicious and in a copper mug.

The beer cheese fries are wonderful for drinking/drunk food. 

The service was prompt, polite, and not over the top-- I hate when waiters try too hard to be your new BFF. 

Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great beer choices, good food, and suuuuuuper friendly staff! I went because they have a dog friendly patio in Tempe And they were so accommodating to my dog and to us! Staff and managers were very attentive and the beer was great! I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Bouncer staff was unprofessional when dealing my group of bicycling friends. Their words \"we don't like you here\" were unneeded and unprofessional. I will not come back here if they don't support bicyclists. Why do they have bicycles hanging over their taps if they don't bicyclists to buy drinks?!?!?"}
{"text":"Literally get no stars due to the choice of employing the most douche bag bouncers that exist on mill avenue. Don't bother going here if you plan on having a chill night with friends. You will be kicked out for no apparent reason by so called \"bouncers\" on a power trip. Not bitter, just speaking the truth. Will never receive my business, and will let all of my friends know not to waste their time."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Handlebars on a mellow bar crawl. Unfortunately someone wanted the table we were sitting at outside, three of us had gotten up to order drinks since the cocktail waiter was nowhere to be seen. The manager asked our four friends still sitting at the table to move in exchange for a free round. The rest of us sat down at the new table and after 40 minutes one of us finally asked if the manager could come back and help with the free round situation. He came back and said only four drinkers were covered for the first round (which most everyone had already payed for) and those same four people could have an additional free drink. Two stars because they ended up promising to comp 8 drinks total, but no one else ended up at the other table and our whole party (10 by the end of the night) had to squeeze into a much smaller table. One additional star because the fries were amazing. Minus a star for general weirdness and attitude, minus one star because I came during their Sunday posted hours last week and they were closed."}
{"text":"Mark provides service that you don't see anymore.Mark is awesome.

We were in for an ASU football game in October. Mark was helping us. Mark mentioned that next time we were in he would take care of us, (because there was some beer confusion when we were there)  and he would have a great beer for us.  We have stopped by several times since, hadn't seen Mark again, but  this time it was 7 months later and Mark remembered us, I barely remembered the situation but he did. He walked up to us with two beers in his hand and said which one you  want.  Phenomenal personal service.  You don't find that conscientious service these days very often. Very very impressed.  Would highly recommend the personal service they provide."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on Mill Ave!  Beers in all flavors.  Fabulous food and great service.
Best grilled cheese in town!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers and fries!! My husband also gets the fish and chips and he says it's great. The decor is cool and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great brew selection and willing to do what you want for food. Pro tip: they have no freezers so their grilled chicken is actually grilled chicken. :)
Excellent service. Beautiful outdoor seating that includes an outdoor side to the bar with heaters -- perfect."}
{"text":"Is there a manager that even works here?! Our server over charged and under charged two checks by $10. She spent 10 minutes walking around trying to find them to fix the checks. The server ended up paying one of the guest with her own money to fix the issue. Not sure if the bar will reimburse her since the manager wasn't around. Ordered a grilled cheese with chicken received a grilled cheese. Our other meals came out great! Other then the lack of attention to detail and management not being around to support their team. Experience was good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great burgers. Went there with my hubby and friends. I would come back for sure! Pretzels and beer are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place and great beer! Kyle the bartender was a super cool dude and the staff are all personable. Must check it out!"}
{"text":"if one of your signature cocktails is a Moscow Mule and your menu specifically says it comes in a copper mug, it shouldn't come in glass or plastic. I've experienced both from this place. serve the drink the way it's indented to be served."}
{"text":"I love writing in bars. This place has a bar with outlets so I can plug in my computer, get free wifi and grab a beer. Ambiance is nice and I love the open air feel."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place because of the large selection of craft beer and because it looks like a cool spot with a fun atmosphere and a great patio area. My boyfriend and I tried it out for Friday night happy hour. The girl bartender who helped us didn't attend to us until about 5 minutes after we sat down at the bar, and not because it was busy, but because she was chatting with the other bartender at the opposite end. 5 minutes, eh no biggie, but when she did come over, she seemed less than thrilled to be there and serve us. The vibe after that was just kind of blah. She never came back around for us to order round two so we instead flagged her down to close out and take our business next door to Zipps for the rest of our happy hour which then turned into hours ;)"}
{"text":"I like the darker, slightly woodsy interior and somewhat intimate cut-out booths on the sides.  It's a nice environment.  Service is friendly and food was reasonably good.  The pretzels in beer cheese sauce were really good. The burger was above average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Handlebar is not the typical bar on Mill Ave, which is why I think it is one of the best bars on Mill Ave.  There is no DJ, but there is music which makes the environment very casual and relaxing.  The drink specials are great and their food selection, though limited, is very good and hand-made.  Never once have I had a bad time at Handlebar and I don't think I ever will."}
{"text":"My favorite country bar in Tempe! Their atmosphere is my favorite. Also their menu of food and drinks is to die for. I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I was lucky to be invited to one  of the pre-opening events and there's nothing not to L-O-V-E about this place.

The decor is just awesome, the fact that they built the place with an environmentally friendly approach (waterless urinals, power saving lighting, tankless waterheathers)  is to admire since they didn't sacrifice in looks and comfort (proof that doing the right thing can be also sexy).

I tried one of their beers, Firestone DBA and it was just delish. The temperature of the beer was great and the selection was wonderful (it was tough to choose what to have).

I'm sure this new gem of Tempe is a great addition for the neighborhood. 

I can't wait to try the food!

Update: Since I said I couldn't wait to try the food, I went back and tried the sausages and the fries. I just have two words to describe it: simple & delicious. The dipping sauces were pretty tasty and original."}
{"text":"Like..  But no captain?  Really?  How does a \"bar\" not have captain?  Sailor jerry is not an equivalent"}
{"text":"Absolute horrible service. Ordered a drink, got just got a splash, yes, splash of premium alcohol I ordered. Ordered two other drinks that we tasted from a friend earlier and it tasted nothing like their drink. Asked if they could fix the drink, they said \"they used all the same recipe and there's nothing we can do\" customer service doesn't exist here! Just glad I put this on my Amex card so I don't have to pay for such negligent service!"}
{"text":"Great patio place, doggie friendly & yummy burgers/beer/fries. Gotta check it out if you're on Mill anywhere. So fun & chill."}
{"text":"Bomb ass fries and a bomb ass vibe. One of the few spots on Mill not solely catering to the college crowd. Welcome atmosphere inside and out."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place.. I like that it is relaxed and fairly cheap, but I feel cramped in here no matter what, unless I am outside. The layout is either genius or terrible, and I can't determine which. But as my best friends mom used to say, if you can't say anything nice then shut your whining pie hole - or something to that effect. 

My last visit was nice. It was. The bartender was on top of stuff, even if he possibly was the only one that truly had his ducks in a row (why you feel the need to keep ducks in a row - I never understood).. but $5 fries with two sauces, out of one is a peppercorn ranch does but a dent in my diet, but is also a lifesaver if one feel well served by any place on might have patronized previous to this place.

I will be back sometime.. and be the old creepy guy that stares because he have forgotten his glasses."}
{"text":"We didn't eat but this was a great stop for a brew or two before our night got going. I would definitely make this a highlight stop though. Great service, great beer selections,   Full bar as well, local beers, good music, overall a great atmosphere right in downtown Tempe. The knowledgeable staff was able to make suggestions on good local beer. Gotta try the Four Peaks Brewing Co. \"Kiltlifter\"."}
{"text":"I always receive top notch service here. Pretty good beer selection and the garlic fries are addictive. My favorite bar on Mill. And in Tempe."}
{"text":"I really like the environment and atmosphere and it's great for bicycle lovers. Good food and decent drinks, the only thing negative is the prices but sometimes you pay for the quality. Nice place to stop by on mill ave."}
{"text":"Weirdest Restaurant experience ever.  Went here with my wife and our 19 year old son.  After my wife and I had already ordered two (alcoholic) drinks and my son had asked for water, the waitress suddenly said she needed to see his ID.  I reminded her he had ordered water.  She said she still needed to see his ID because it was a \"weird Arizona law\".  I told her that made no sense and reminded her I had just told her he was 19.  She said she could not serve us if he was underage.  I was incredulous at this stage and so asked if we could just get food.  She said she could not serve us anything if he was underage - again stating this was an Arizona law.  She then went on to say that she could check with her manager and he might be able to allow it.  We were then left for more than 10 minutes before another waiter asked if we were being helped.  We told him our story and he said, as we suspected, that this was not a law but a restaurant policy due to issues with underage drinking.  He also said the manager would need to determine if we could be served.  The manager  did a few minutes later condescendingly judge us as suitable to be served - at that stage we decided to leave.  I have no issues with any bar/restaurant making effort to address underage drinking, but to lie about their policy and say it is state law is unacceptable and to treat customers like crap is even worse."}
{"text":"Great place to come and have a beer during the week. They have a fantastic selection of beers and a decent happy hour special. This place has a pretty unique vibe that lets it stand out from most of the other bars that are downtown on Mill Ave. The patio area is a perfect spot to grab a beer and relax with friends no matter what time of year. The place gets pretty rowdy on the weekends but its still a pretty cool joint."}
{"text":"Great pub with a solid beer selection and great service.  We were there lunch time on a sat when it was pretty quiet but the bartender was great and we always had a full glass.  The burgers and fried where great and they have a blue cheese bacon sauce for dipping and burger that rocks.  The handles included some favorites from Bels, left hand, firestone, and locals from four peaks.  Warm vibe with lots of wood and clean industrial lines.  Would definitely place them a notch above the other bars on the mill strip"}
{"text":"Really cool \"handle-bar\" theme, great drink specials on happy hour, and located right in the heart of mill-ave.. Try the fish & chips, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for a Local First Arizona lunch mixer! Thanks for hosting! My husband and I each had a classic burger and shared a fry. The burgers are delicious and loved the dipping sauce option for the fries. Service was also excellent, especially given the size of the group.

I am excited to go back and try more since we work nearby. Definitely one of the better options on Mill!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and at first was really impressed. That has not been the case lately, they seem to be out of a lot of the beers I ask for and the waiters have been hit and miss."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Any place with good beer is top of my list, especially when they have Delerium on tap. There happy hour is killer and cant beat their seasoned fries, although their menu could have more selection. There are not too many places on Mill that I enjoy going to, in most cases try to avoid Mill, but this place is a great place to enjoy a few adult beverages after work."}
{"text":"Staff, Food, Beer options all ROCK! 

We had a great time a few nights while we were in town for a conference.  Fantastic normal tap list and then we were there one night when sierra nevada took over the taps with great options....prices for drink and food were fantastic...we really enjoyed the burgers, brats and pretzels the few times we ate there.  Courtney at the bar and the rest of the crew were fantastic.  Wish we had one in Madison!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Bar manager was super personable and friendly! He really helped us decide what to drink. Definitely coming back asap"}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing. We tried to go with a group. They lost our reservation so we didn't get to sit outside, not a huge deal but not good. They offered a free round of shots to make up for it but they gave us no choice in shots so while this might have been something to help them recover, for all we knew we got sugar water. They didn't have to offer up the expensive stuff but some say in what we wanted would have made it better. Next, our service was terrible. After they moves us to a spot that was too small for our group (because remember they lost our reservation) it took almost 20 minutes to get a server at our table. Then the server was MIA all too often. On top of that, the food selection for a group was miserable. Granted, it's on us for not doing better research on what food options were available for a group but it was disappointing. The only easily shareable items on the menu were literally fries and pretzels. Sorry, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for a quick dinner on a Wed night.  It was a fabulous choice.  We sat outside under the lights (and heaters!) and had wonderful service and food.  Everyone was really fun and kind without being cloying.  The hamburgers were great and we had some fruit/beer thing (it was pink) and even I, a scotch and vodka drinker, liked it.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Celebrating finishing a marathon with a couple drinks and some pretzels at Handlebar! Drinks are awesome! The margarita isn't too sweet. Pica and Erin provided excellent service. Highly recommend checking out Handlebar if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Made my first visit today and really enjoyed, partially due to the Four Peaks tap takeover as part of AZ Beer Week. Happy hour pricing definitely helped, but I could see myself coming back.

The only downside that I had: the bartender seemed to favor cigarettes over cigars when it came to how they set up their smoking policy on their patio, which a real shame. Lots of cigar smokers would likely enjoy this place if they weren't exiled to the back corner of the patio. Too bad the poison smoke from cigarettes seems to be favored as opposed to the natural smoke from cigars. Oh well, can't be perfect, I guess...."}
{"text":"Apparently the handlebar is like an institution in Tempe.  It's known for its beer and laid back atmosphere.  They had plenty of televisions for sports watching and bench seating for larger groups.  The patio was a great addition, for smoking or possibly hanging out when the weather is nice.  We stopped in because another bar was fully packed and we saw another group was going into Handlebar and commenting on the display in the window.  There was so type of indecent doll doing something to a handlebar.  Sounds like the perfect place to me.  
My husband and I were waiting to go to dinner later so we only ordered drinks.  Our waiter was pretty attentive at first but the more people that came in that he knew the less we saw of him.  I ordered a Moscow mule that had whiskey but wasn't strong so I could have kept with the pitcher of water on the table.  My husband ordered some drink with beer and vodka, I believe but as you can see, it was so forgettable I can't even remember what it was.  Pretty much we had a pit stop to warm up and figure out our next course of action.  Walgreens would have been a better option."}
{"text":"Love this place, just 1 bad experience last weekend with one of the new bouncers. Very surprised about it."}
{"text":"I live on Mill and I've watched the changes over the course of 10 years. It's refreshing that Tempe has continued to develop a more diverse crowd these days. I couldn't be more excited about The Handlebar opening up and had high expectations, considering it's sister restaurants on Mill (La Bocca and Canteen) always deliver!

Everything from the music selection down to the 3 different types of wood used to warm up the interior space, I forgot that I was not in a hip German pub but in fact, downtown Tempe. Almost every exterior wall is a garage door that opens up to bar seating from the outside - love it.

Although World of Beer is a block away, the beer selection and atmosphere at The Handlebar reign supreme. I'm looking forward to trying more of the brats and pretzels with a wide selection of beers (hello.... Celebrator Doppelbock)! There are even beer cocktails on the menu!

What I'm most excited about, is that the level of music will not change all night, yet they'll still be open until 2am! If you frequent Mill Ave, you'll know that around 10pm the vibe at most places change. The DJs step in and blare club music. I don't mind it some of the time, but I'll most likely find myself on the patio of this pet friendly, bike friendly bar and grill.

Congrats Mill Ave, you got yourself a winner!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and servers. Love to come here on Mill. Try the \"i thought of this while riding my bicycle.\" So happy this place is here."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went here for two drinks after work.  Very cool atmosphere, good rinks and right downtown Mill avenue.  The windows and doors all open up and when you are inside you feel like your outside and when your outside you feel like you are a part of the inisde.  Great place to grab a drink!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is decent, the outside area is where the location really shines. Great at night time with the misters. Last time I came out here with a group, we sat by one of the fireplaces but intentionally had it turned off since Phoenix summer heat sucks.

Would return here, but what sucks is their lack of decent food options. Then again, I suppose that's part of the whole \"barhopping\" aspect of the Mill Ave experience."}
{"text":"Great drink selection and amazing food for a bar. Staff not impressed with my dance moves, so 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty much a place to drink and eat sausage it appears. Yes, this is unlike my drinking venues when i went to college when all we needed was the finest domestics and a sweaty small dance floor for drunken make-out sessions. The handlebar has bud lught, but mill is focused on craft beers and this place also gets fancy with pretty lights and an outdoor patio or two. I sat at bar and there was a more festive asu crowd watching the devils lose. Happy hour had good drink specials and i also tried the fresh cut fries, which were just average as these didnt have skin on and were kinda stubby. Blue cheese bacon dipping sauce was the highlight there. Another good place to drink it up. TV's are too spread out at the bar though."}
{"text":"The perfect hangout and do nothing but drink bar. Food is ok, service is great, atmosphere is unparalleled. When people bring their dogs you know it's all good.."}
{"text":"Had a company holiday party and loved the atmosphere. All i can say is get the paper route tall boy of pbr, shot of jameson and a cigarette can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and a much more courteous staff. Had a good time! The bartenders were very knowledgable and had great ideas based on your taste preferences. I'm an IPA fan, and they gave me quite a few new beers to try."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour. Take advantage of their 1/2 price drinks and appetizers, best deal on Mill Ave. The atmosphere is great, a large patio with long tables and bench seating, plenty of room for a large group. The inside is nice too, big bar and side walls that roll up to make the inside seem like part of the outside patio.  They have a nice selection of beers and have found the wait staff to be friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome service/drink selection/atmosphere/food. I'll be spending a ton of my time and money here."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good bar food. Mixed drinks are terrible, don't waste your money. That being said they have so much on tap and in bottles, it's not like they lack for options. Another Mill Ave successes for Julian."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since it opened in Tempe. I love that the atmosphere is laid back and open. The large patio is always a perk when you want to relax and enjoy the weather. They have a great selection of beers and cocktails to try and their pretzels are great when they are served hot! All in all this is a great laid back spot to go when you're not looking for a wild party."}
{"text":"Overpriced hipster bar full of bearded and tattooed liberal hipsters. Small uneventful and Incredibly expensive who wants a $12 burger at a bar? Or to pay $7 for a draft beer plus the GM Knick nitz is a giant vagina and can't handle any of his own stuff. They also have the same DJ every weekend if you want to hear the same songs over and over and over to great place to go."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good, limited food menu. Place was hopping when we were there and good people watching"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do, but it's just been eh the past three times we've gone. Saturday we did a bar hop beach cruiser day, and when we went in, it was packed, the music was so loud you couldn't hear yourself thing, and the bar staff was huddled at one end of the bar with a tall blonde bartender watching him do magic tricks. I really wanted my water filled, but no luck. I also think I have a bias because I really like menu options and there aren't many. Just nothing special."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Bar staff has always been friendly. Menu is small but has nice options. I love the quinoa salad and the hot pretzels. Great outdoor seating especially when large garage windows are open."}
{"text":"More bar than grille but still very good sandwiches for lunch/dinner. The menu also has nice snacks to go with a few drinks.   Very attentive service,  very comfortable and relaxed setting."}
{"text":"I checked out The Handlebar & Grill last Friday night with huge expectations. Honestly, it was just ok. The service was kind of slow, the beers were really expensive compared to other locations with craft beers on draft. The sausage I got was ok...The fries and the dipping sauces were really good. The atmosphere is pretty good, but honestly I would rather be at one of the bars over in the Maple/Ash area. I might go back and try some other food from them, but probably not order the beer, Taste of Tops is better for that stuff..."}
{"text":"I was all set to love this place because of it's awesome set up (indoor/outdoor bar) & relaxed atmosphere, but then my salad came. If I had only drank here, I am sure my review would be 4 or 5 stars primarily because they can open up all the walls so it's a completely open air bar which is perfect for Arizona. The menu is small but has lots of good pub grub on it, but I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a salad. My friends' food came out before mine and their sandwiches and burgers looked great - upscale toppings, cheeses, thick breads, nice presentation, etc. The french fries are yummy and come with great dipping sauces.

Then my salad was brought out. It was a salad you buy from Wendy's or other such fast food places, still in a disposable black bowl with the clear disposable top. The lettuce was dry, there were a couple of tomatoes, a few slices of cucumber, a sliced hard boiled egg, and that was it! The menu listed carrots, radishes, onion, and smoked cheddar as ingredients but none of that was on it. I mean, COME ON, put it on a real plate and give me all the ingredients or don't serve it at all."}

{"text":"Came on a Friday, not busy at all but the service was super slow.  Later on I hear their kitchen is the size of a sink, which makes sense than that things will just take longer to dish out.

Prices are reasonable.  You seat yourself, so don't stand around waiting (like we did) to get a table. But it took our waiter a really long time to come and get our drink and food order. 

Two-stars for service and speed.  
Food/ambiance/price/portions - more like a 3-star."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere at Handlebar - they have multiple garage doors which roll up to the outside and it's especially nice with the cooler weather.  They've got plenty of TVs, so this is a great place to go and watch the game.

I really enjoyed the fries, mostly for the dipping sauces, and would highly recommend the thai ketchup and the sundried tomato basil aioli.  The bratwursts on the menu are also delicious.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the beer menu.  Definitely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"JT (bartender/manager) killed it! Good music and beer, badass cocktails custom made by JT and a little bit of food to snack on...will be back :)"}
{"text":"I will admit that I didn't read the fine print on the Groupon and tried to use it on a Saturday afternoon, but the experience was bad from start to finish.  You know that parking will be difficult in that area, so once you've managed to arrive, you're expecting to treated well. 

 It was pouring rain outside so we inquired about perhaps a hot buttered rum to warm up.  The bartender informed us they didn't have anything like that.  We asked about brandy, and he said they had brandy and asked what kind we wanted.  We asked what they had.  He said he didn't know and went to look.  He returned to tell us that they didn't have any.  Mind you, this is the BARTENDER, and he never even suggested a coffee with khaluha or ANYTHING.  We setteled on jack and coke and looked at the meager menu.  

They say they are a bar and grill, but your choices consist of two sausages, a couple burgers, a single turkey sandwich, and i think two salads.  It was a joke.  When we were denied the use of the Groupon, we paid our bill and left.  

As we were leaving there were people at the door that appeared to be the owners.  We walked out shaking our heads at the experience.  Y'all can keep your $10 I wasted on the Groupon.  We already wasted $2 for parking to get to an establishment that is more a bar that serves something to eat than a bar and grill, where the bartenders have no idea what is in stock, nor do they know how to suggest a proper alternative.  REALLY people?  You will be closed in no time....."}
{"text":"Great selection of drafts and amazing fries. Love meeting friends here for a nice, long evening."}
{"text":"I thought of this while riding my bicycle was a great drink! Amanda was an amazing server as well, recommended great drinks and was so nice!"}
{"text":"hey! I liked this place. very casual and laid back. really cool ambiance and great patio."}
{"text":"Decent food. Pretty good drinks. Reasonable prices. Horrible service.

Pros: The burger and fries were good enough to warrant a return trip. The beer selection was pretty good. Couldn't complain about the drink prices. The manager was pretty helpful, and gave me an industry discount (I'm a bartender) when he brought the check.

Cons: Absolutely the worst service I've had in years, by far! We sat down on the patio, where most of the other guests were, for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped. He got us some water and sent the server over. He took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks. We didn't see him again for quite a long time. I was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one. Every time the waiter was at our table, it was because the manager had told him to go there. 
 I had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and I no longer had any interest in staying. Once again, the manager handled the situation very well (sending the waiter over and discounting the bill). After we had the bill, the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed. He was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book. It was really uncomfortable.  The moment the book closed, the waiter had it in his hands. He ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip. (as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15% even for crappy service. this service warranted $1 however.) 
 Nobody expects incredible service in a bar. It's a real laid-back place. I do expect some service though. It is, after all, why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar, but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad, he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot, but I will be sitting at the bar if i do. The server in question was a tall red-haired male.
 
 i really liked the beer I had there too. I wish I could have bought 10 more. If only there was someone to serve them to me."}
{"text":"Service has gotten considerably better the past few visits. Now worth visiting."}
{"text":"Best burgers and bratwursts ever! I've gotten the guyere burger, backyard bbq burger, and the fresh bratwurst grilled cheese style.

guyere burger is AMAZING. just make sure to tell your waitress to cook it at most, medium. the backyard bbq burger is also delicious and should be cooked medium at most. these burgers will forever be my #1 favorite, top of the top, and standard for all burgers.

the bratwurst was amazing! especially grilled cheese style. it comes with two sides of sauces and fries. i got the beer cheese and raw onions. grilled cheese style makes the bratwurst come out with sandwich bread and cheese (like a grilled cheese lol). the sausage was beautiful. had the snap that i look for in hot dogs. 

the fries were amazing too! however, it can come a little bit salty. they're thicker cut but not too thick. they're cooked to perfection.

parking can be found everywhere, both on the streets and in the structure shared with the plaza."}
{"text":"I keep Handlebar as my routine spot because its one of the few places on Mill that has all the components I love: Its laid back, has a huge back patio, decent Happy hour prices and NO (I repeat NO) undergrad ASU students. That's right folks, the crowd is on the older/professional/no delta-gamma-kappa-alpha-Nu-Sigma side. Weeeee

Besides coming here for beers and quality day drinking, I'm happy to say that their tiny tiny food menu is also really good. Although they only carry a burger, sausage and salad options, everything they have is very well suggested and recommended. Their sausage with sweet and spicy peppers is legit: the peppers are fresh, the sausage is.. well I rather not say anything r-rated so ill just stick to... delicious. Its quite big and a great snack when you are having beers and cocktails. Their salad is also quite filling and decent, but I would stick to the burger and sausage options cause, well, Meat.

Meat is always better."}
{"text":"So my friends and I were out on a Sunday and went to two different places to find NO specials, loud annoying music and lack of misters to help endure the AZ heat but still enjoy the weather.  THEN we stumble upon \"The Handlebar\" in Tempe.  This place had a great atmosphere, HAPPY HOUR (every day of the week including SUN), misters that hit cha no matter where you sat and GREAT staff!  There was a gentleman (manager?) who stopped by 3 times in our short visit just to make sure everything about our visit was satisfactory.  NICE!  Their menu could stand to be a little expanded but my friend did try the brat and I agree w/the one bite I took, TASTY!  I couldn't decide on the beer I wanted so the server suggested to let her bring me a few taste glasses to help me decide.  They also have the coolest big long rectangle fire pit w/seating all around the edge-very classy looking.  Last but not least, the crowd is mature!  Not your average \"Mill Ave\" hang out which is nice for most of us \"non-20sums\".  If you're looking for a nice outdoor atmosphere in Tempe w/great staff/customer service and decent pricing...this is your joint!"}
{"text":"It's a typical Tempe college bar and probably my favorite. Full of college kids and people who want to be surrounded by college kids. And it gets a little wild."}
{"text":"So glad to see some quality places coming back to Mill Avenue!  We sat out on the patio Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves...the temperatures were perfect, the happy hour beer prices were great and the service was friendly and efficient.  They were playing good music (when they weren't competing with next door) and they had TV's inside to keep up with the football games.  Overall, a great place to go and drink beer with friends, but don't expect an extensive menu.  BTW, heard the patio is pet friendly, so definitely bringing back my dog next time!"}
{"text":"Had the polish sausage hoagie which was awesome.  The rest of my group also loved their food, I just wish the menu was bigger.  Large selection of beers, wines and mixed drinks.  Nice atmosphere, inside/outside seating.  WIsh they had more TV's."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Handlebar last night. My boyfriend and I are new to Tempe and decided to take a stroll down Mill. We like to bring our dog Rudolph everywhere we go and since we are walking distance to Mill, we decided he should come too. As we approached Handlebar my boyfriend was scoping out places to tie Rudolph up outside the bar. I asked the security guard if Rudolph was allowed on the patio and he said sure. After we order some beers from the outside bar, another security guard had one of the workers fetch Rudolph some water. This gesture was small but seriously sweet. It's little things like that that will keep me coming back to a place. My boyfriend had a great experience with one of the bartenders as well. He told the bartender what kind of beer he liked and the bartender brought out three samples for him to try. 

Overall, we had a great time with our dog. Rudolph was a big hit with the patrons of the bar. Most everyone that walked by wanted to touch him. We will DEFINITELY be back. 

The only reason the 4 stars isn't a 5 is because there weren't any drink specials. I know it was a Friday night, but you should have at least some promo going on at one time. It cost $5.50 for a 12oz IPA. That is more like LA prices!!! I know you can do better than that Handlebar :)"}
{"text":"If you like beer this is a must. Tyler the manager/bartender knows his beer.  The beer list is like no other I have seen in AZ. Moving from San Diego I was excited to see quality taps, not just the cookie cutter craft beer list you see at most places. Well done Handlebar."}
{"text":"Good service and fun atmosphere. Many beer choices on tap."}
{"text":"Handlebar is one of those places that my friends and I just wind up at. I don't really know the details of how or why this is the place, but everyone knows where its at, and getting an uber to drop you off on university and mill and walking is usually super easy.

The drinks I've had here are pretty stiff, but there's almost never any seating inside on a busy night, but move outside to the patio and you'll find some seating there... The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. 

I mean it doesn't blow my socks off to be here, but hey, its a bar on mill, what can you expect?"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and good selection of beers.  I enjoyed my beer.  Not sure it is historic."}
{"text":"Sarah the bartender makes the best old fashioned I've had on Mill. Really great. Thank you Sarah!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in the event tonight. I went with my friend who was celebrating her birthday and was attempting to show her something new on Mill. It definitely did not work out that way.

We got in and were told that there was seating available. We walked around a few times and finally found some group that was leaving and grabbed their table. We waited.

Finally our waitress, Brittany, came over and apologized for the mess on the table, got our drink order and left. We waited. She finally showed up about 10 minutes later with our beers and bolted off. Where we were sitting, there were two picnic tables, side by side, we (the two of us), sat on the table closest to the roll top doors; there was a four top on the other table. Another group of five decided that they were going to sit in between our groups. We said fine, as we understood that there was limited seating and that they were in the same situation as we were a few minutes ago.

We waited again. She came and took their drink order and we were able to stop and ask about the food service this evening. We were told initially that there were people passing around samples. What we were told by Brittany was this:\"there are people bringing food around as samples; if you get some, your lucky\". We never got any food.

In fact, the other four people on the opposite end, were served twice. Two trays, both times. We finally resigned to the fact that we were not going to get any type of food and were ready to leave.

We looked for our waitress and were unable to find her. We finally located her and tried to get her attention and she was serving the table behind us who kept running her, one beer at a time it seemed, to the well. As we finally got eye contact with her and closed our tab, we made it to the front and exited.

There were plenty of what seemed to be managers, hob knobbing with other guests. They were not paying attention to anything that was going on. I understand that this was a preview night, but that is one of the goals as managers; to identify where there are issues and resolve them.

I was truly disappointed with the service, the staff, and since I have never tried the food, I would not know what to comment on that part of your offerings."}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about the ambience  and crowd here. I hiked the A mt and came for lunch never being here before expected a good time and a good cocktail after a hot afternoon. Sat down waited a good while till I was served got asked if I had been helped or not \"unorganized\" we asked for a vodka lemonade tonic something refreshing and good got asked for our ids mind you I've come to mill for years before I even became of age with a fake I'd been of age for 3 yrs as well as my friend he bent her I'd and even after proof with her passport was convinced it was fake bent my I'd tht I had just ordered and used days before in portland and az he refused to serve us drinks... Not a big deal so we ordered I wanted to order the cheese fries to find out they are out of fries. So no drink and literally being out of half of ther limited menu I have a very distaste left in my mouth will not be returning Ever... And will not be recommending this place ever instead go across the street to la bocca and have an amazing sangria and much better service 0 stars and to my server who I'm assuming is a manager of some sort you may need to brush up on ur I'd checking because tht was awful service and experience.




To continue this the owner of the restaurant emailed us and offered his sincerest apology and said tht the situation will b taken care of very pressed with the promptness and concern"}
{"text":"I like the place and the service from Candace was awesome, food was just ok"}
{"text":"So the wife and I are taking a little Staycation in Tempe this weekend and decide to hit Mill Ave on a Saturday night. THIS is a first for me, being in my 40's. I've never had the desire to hang out in College town on a weekend night.
We LOVED the Handlebar, it was one of the least obnoxious bars on Mill. 
Sorry bass pumping techno music or hip hop doesn't do it for me. 
We laughed and gave the doorman shit when he asked for our ID's........REALLY? We're the oldest ones in here!!!  We gladly gave him our ID's and must of caught the attention of the manager on duty, before we got our first drink, shots were sent over! YEAH!!  Bar staff was great all night, great selection of beer, we didn't order any food, we didn't want to ruin our buzz. We liked it so much, we came back and started Sunday Funday here!  The only thing I can say bad about this place is the Lilith fair, depressing music on Sunday, it was a 180 from Saturday night."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally go to Handlebar.  
I love beer, I love bicycles and I like bar food!  

We went tonight; a hot, humid summer monsoon evening.  They keep all the doors and windows open but as nice as that sounds, that means that it will also be hot and humid inside.  I grew up in Arizona, and run long distances so I'm used to heat.  I was wet with sweat after about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, I order my $6.50 beer and sadly discover they pour 12 oz draft beers, not pints like ummm, pretty much every other place there is. 
 
So, for prices that are about 33% too high, you get 3/4 of a beer.

I wasn't going to do that again so I switch gears.  
It's Tito's Vodka night.  There's a rep from Tito's giving samples. She mentions that Tito's Vodka drinks are $4.  

Which ones? \"All drinks with Tito's vodka\", she says.  \"Cool, we'll order some\" I say. 
She is so proud of me, she gives me a T-shirt. 

Our waitress comes by, and asks for our 2nd round order.  
\"We'll have some of the $4 Tito's drinks\".  We ask which ones are on special.  She too says \"All drinks with Tito's Vodka are $4\" 

She's nice and we chit chat and discuss the drinks shown on the Tito's placard on the table. We ask for suggestions, she motions to the placard and says \"All of those are really good,  especially for $4\"

I order a \" vodka sonic\" (soda/tonic) , my wife gets the vodka martini (which the waitress, the table placard, and the Tito's Vodka rep all said was $4)

We get the bill.  My drink was $4 and the ,martini was $6.  

We ask about the discrepancy.  

She says \"Yes, the Vodka part of the martini was $4 but the rest of it was $2 more\" 
 
\"What do you mean 'The rest of it was $2', You told us at least three times the Tito's drinks were $4\"  \"RIGHT HERE (on the table) it says 'Tito's vodka martini; $4'\"

\"Yes, the vodka part is $4 but the martini part was $2 extra.  That totals $6\"

Then why did you, and the Tito's person say it was $4?

\"WELL, everyone knows a martini is extra\"


I guess olives are $1 each.




P.S. The place kind of smelled like pee.


:)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very relaxed. Everyone who works here is very friendly. And the fact that they have different dipping sauces for my fries is amazing. It does tend to get cramped, and sometimes the employees checking IDs at the door can be rude. It is, however, a nice alternative to any other bar on Mill ave on a Saturday night. I would definitely go for the pretzel and fries if nothing else."}
{"text":"This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday \"meeting\".  Otherwise known as happy hour! 
They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server.

If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense. 

With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy.

I will definitely try them out again."}
{"text":"We hit this place on our way to a play at Gammage.  It had a great selection of local beers and all of the food we tried was excellent and very filling. We will definitely be back. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, just watch for the flys in the outdoor area. They also have a fairly good happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here late in the evening to get a couple of drinks. It was a little chilly that night so we enjoyed sitting by the fire pit. They had Christmas lights up for decoration in the patio area, which was a nice addition to the atmosphere. I tried a couple of craft beers, which were great. My friend had gin and tonic, which were pretty weak. Fun place to sit and have a drink!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a ride so the boys can have a drink. Enjoyed an arnold palmer. They got food but didn't get a chance to try their food. staff was friendly & on the ball with service. Outside seating was limited but the positioning was good for watching the people trudge by"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends here on a Sat afternoon. We had fun despite the rude bartenders. I am not sure who or where they think they are...but quite a joke they are!  Management needs to send them back to etiquette class."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I'm never disappointed. They have a great beer selection, wonderful patio seating, and pretty darn good pub food. The Handlebar chicken sandwich is fantastic! Everything is very affordable. This is my go-to place on Mill."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service just is never all that great.  It was funny, though, another waitress was just giving us more napkins and she was really awesome and personable and on the ball and I was like, \"Damn, why couldn't we get her?\"

Their drinks and food are usually pretty solid.  Last night, I ordered a burger, but, man.... a burger doesn't come with fries?  Some other stuff happened with my girlfriend being double charged on her card and stuff but the manager was cool about that.  But, man... no goddamn fries with a burger?  I was like, huh, damn, I could've used some fries and didn't feel like tacking on another five bucks or so to get some.  I came home, went online, and found this little gem on The Onion.  That very night.  It was perfect:

http://www.theonion.com/articles/batshit-insane-restaurant-believes-fries-must-be-p,30424/

Weird... such perfect timing.  And also, yeah!  Burgers come with fries, goddamnit!  I'm not being unreasonable!  Let go of me!  AAHHH!!"}
{"text":"Signed up for tickets to the grand opening, and was completely blown away. The patio is comfortable, and relaxing. The environment is upscale but not sterile. The beer selection was great, and the list of cocktails and shandys are clever and inviting. I was promised food, and did not receive a bite. Only drawback of a remarkable experience. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Reasons for 3 stars:

1. Bartender was rude then entire time and seemed to not want to speak to us or even be there.
2. Food was decent, but lacking in some areas.


We ordered a chicken burger and that was delicious. Fries are bomb! 

The grilled cheese with chicken that we ordered did not come with chicken and was quite a disappointment. I thoroughly disliked it and threw most of it away. It was horrible cooked.

I would like to add that the barback was super cool and attentive to us and I'm fairly certain he had noticed the bartender sucked at his job therefore he stepped up to provide better service to us- thankful for him. 

Next time we come back I hope to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went in tonight and literally stood at the bar for 20 minutes to get a beer, never got acknowledged. The bartenders were both females and seemed to be only attentive to male customers. I just wanted a beer, left to a busier bar (Casa) and was handed my drink within minutes of arriving."}
{"text":"Went here for a couple drinks with some friends and had the the worst bartender ever! The tall blondish guy bartender who was working Saturday night around 9pm is such a dick. We have all worked in the industry and he did everything you're not suppose to do. Extremely rude and not helpful at all.  There was one time when he looked right at me (waiting patiently for a drink) and purposely walked away! And they weren't busy at all! Someone needs to fire that guy and get a real bartender. What an idiot. He works off tips and has the worst attitude."}
{"text":"Handlebar is an amazing bar! I find myself, more often than not, going to Handlebar because of their exceptional service, great beer menu, and because they're one of the only real bars that isn't just there for college students. 

Recently, my girlfriend graduated college and we needed a venue to celebrate. Handlebar hooked us up! Mark and Geoff helped us out a great deal! Not only did they help us reserve the back patio area, but they also accommodated us (without hesitation) during one of the largest sporting days of the year (Kentucky Derby and the MayPac Fight). They both were very professional when presenting options for food, drink and even assigned our own private server. The party went off without a hitch, the food and drink kept coming as we needed it, they even refrigerated our cake! If you ever need to have a space for a small gathering, happy hour meet up, or just to hangout, I highly recommend Handlebar!

Also, big props to Geoff, Mark, and our server (sadly I forgot her name). Geoff is our favorite bartender and Mark is a fantastic owner!"}
{"text":"This place was just average. 

Bar was cool. Some indoor outdoor. Music was far too loud with DJ there that we couldn't converse.

Drinks were good. 

Food was average. Loved the sweet potato fries with the bacon dip. But our sandwiches were all extremely bland. 

Overall, just ok. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Maybe caught on a bad day. Server was rude. She took forever to be serve our drinks. sat for a while before getting served. It's very frustrating when 2-3 services pass by your table and you go unnoticed. Beer selection is AWSOME However due to the slow service we only had one. We did order another round however took to long so just pulled the tab. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Fire pit at the back patio, score baby!

You might think I'm crazy, getting excited over a fire pit while in Arizona when it's 100 degrees. Haha...Not when it's Fall season, it's pretty chilly out there.

Review is for the Halloween weekend! New Place on Mills ave!

Friend brought boyfriend and I here the first night we arrived to Arizona. 
Drinks were tasty, though I don't remember the name of it because all I did was just point in the dim darkness of where I was sitting. The boyfriend and our friend got the beers in a fancy cute cup. I laughed out loud when I saw it just because it looked girly. :P

2 stars for the patio and fire pit and a star and a half for the service and the atmosphere. There's bench seats inside and out. Full Bar, no complains. 

Funny story, saw a guy in his tux, holding a dozen of roses and thought he was going to propose. We asked the waitress what's going on, since we keep seeing him texting and looking at the door, then we found out he was just the waitress's boyfriend. D: Whoops.

Anywho, will give this place another try when it's not too pack."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy this bar and I've tried it a couple time - the wait is long & the food was not worth the wait. On one occasion - it took 40 minutes to get our food for two people! I don't understand how it takes 40 minutes to make a burger & fries.  The waitress who served us was also rude and inconsiderate about the wait time. The manager tried to be nice and took off a round of drinks although we were charged for full price drinks instead of the happy hour price so it ended up not doing anything to the bill. At that point I was not willing to wait another 10 minutes to speak to someone about the bill so we just left. The vibe of the bar is more grungy which makes it more like a biker bar. Also the happy hour pricing is not amazing, they are similar compared to any other bar on Mill."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a drink and some food.  I got the gruyer burger with fries.  The burger was amazing!  The brioche bun it came on was delicious as well.  The French fries had some nice seasonings on them and the potatoes tasted sweet and didn't taste like they had been previously frozen.  I would recommend this place for sure!  Only bad part is that their barstools don't have backs to them, but they had a few regular tables."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to visit The Handlebar and was pleasantly surprised! It was nothing like what I expected a beer bar to be on Mill Ave, and that's a good thing! The atmosphere is rustic, chill and enjoyable. The staff is very knowledgable and friendly and there are plenty of tvs and seats to enjoy a game. 

Now let's talk beer. They have a rotating beer menu which allows you to try different beers on tap every visit. During my visit, I had a delicious white chocolate ale. It tasted like beer with a chocolate after taste! I don't know if I could have had more than one, but it was still was tasty. While looking through the menu, we noticed that they serve beer cocktails which intrigued me so I had to give one a try! I'm glad I did because their beer cocktails are amazing! They also serve pims cups in copper mugs. 

While there, I noticed that they have great happy hour pricing daily from 3-6:30 ($3 off beer, well drinks and wine) and considering that the beers are only around $5 to begin with, the happy hour pricing is a smokin' deal! I also appreciated the purse hooks they have at the bars. 

Finally, the food. They have a small but mighty menu consisiting of pretzels, sausages and burgers. We had the pretzels with beer cheese. Yum!! The beer cheese is amazing and the pretzels were fresh from the oven. Next time we'll stay for a burger and more beer."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and dessert. We got there during happy hour. All beer was $2 off! My husband drank 3 coors for $9.75. I got 2 bloody Mary's and the dessert pretzels. The pretzels were cinnamon sugar with marshmallow sauce on top. Really good! Sad they only give you 2! 
Total our bill was $23! Not too bad! 
Just wish they would give better veggies with the Bloody Mary and give another pretzel per order for desserts!"}
{"text":"on a last minute happy hour invitation, the wife and i rode our bikes to the handlebar to meet some friends. it's right off mill and i've walked right past it unfortunately several times. 

we were seated right away and given a run-down of some of their beer specials. i'm not sure who he was, but he was very intense and passionate about the beer selection and i very much appreciated that. my beer was served promptly as was my wifes glass of wine. we then received another server whom took the remainder of our happy hour and food orders. 

we split the only vegetarian option on the menu, the portobello burger. it was huge! and delicious, albeit a little pricey at 10 bucks and the fries were extra. the happy hour drink specials more than made up for it. she kept our water glasses filled so we wouldn't be sloshing drunk riding our bikes home in the dark through papago park. 

the interior is very clean, rustic/modern with a huge bar, and plenty of patio seating which i hear allows dogs. my wife griped about the sink being outside the bathroom-\"since girls like to primp\" and thought it wouldn't be prudent to check nose hairs in full view of everyone else. me? i just like to wash my hands. 

a cool spot that wasn't filled with college kids, and had a great selection of beers! hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place because of Groupon, I decided to give it a try. It was easy to find and the atmosphere was great. I liked the open seating concept, although it was about 15 minutes before we were greeted or helped. (The service was fantastic after that hiccup.) I ordered the Gruyere Burger and beer cheese for the dipping sauce, my date ordered the fried chicken sandwich with spicy bbq. The food was so flavorful. It was definitely made with fresh ingredients. The local Java stout was a perfect pairing for the burger! I will definitely go back. The prices were great, the food and the service exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem! The staff was super friendly, and the happy hour beer specials cannot be beat! I would recommend the Handlebar to anyone! Being out-of-towner's, we knew very little about the area, our waiter was kind enough to put together a list of bars and local bands he thought that we should check out....talk about going above and beyond the call of duty! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"my roommate and i had the good fortune of attending the grand opening last night and besides a few kinks that need working out, this place is (gonna be) awesome. our server, kaycee (sp?), was extremely polite and attentive and definitely added to the overall experience. for that alone, i'll return. but there are other reasons...

i like the hanging bike hooks along the outside perimeter of the whole establishment, but beyond that, i didn't see anything else that makes this place bicycle friendly or to even go along with the name \"The Handlebar.\" i hope they add to it.

the beer selection was great, a little bit for everyone. i was happy to see delerium tremens on tap, among others. and i'm happy that our server recommended a bottle of Rochefort 8, as it was too delicious to not sip and savor. moreover, i'm looking forward to seeing what all local beers will be on tap in the future. the buyer has his work cut out for him to keep the beer list interesting, being just about a  block away from world of beer. he's doing a great job so far!

as far as the environment goes, i loved the semi rustic feel to it, the communal tables and the wood/steel everywhere. it's pretty cool that some walls are coated with chalkboard that they write on to update the blown kegs and what's replacing them. sadly, the patio didn't have quite the chill vibe i was hoping for, mainly due to the music. pumping beats doesn't exactly separate you from what every other bar on mill is doing. hopefully, this was only due to it being the grand opening.

all in all, i'm very much anticipating cooler weather so i can ride my bike down here, sit on the patio and enjoy some tasty brew!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to stop in for a snack today and for quite some time, people have been telling me the food was good here... So I thought I would give it a try...
To drink I had the Crispin Cider ale which was an apple ale, very crisp
For my lunch snack I wanted to try the pretzels because I heard those were good but I opted for the Grilled Cheese because I was also told it was good
The GC was very, very good
My bf had the burger and I was a bit jealous when it came out because it looked really good and he said that it was delicious
This makes me like Handlebar even more
The End"}
{"text":"Zero would be best here. I understand doing your job, however bouncers CLAIMING to have seen someone drinking when we'd just arrived in the area is bogus. When you don't want a group of 20 people in your establishment because they're not 20 something is BS! Because we aren't young and showing our boobs to your bouncer doesn't mean anything. You missed out on a lot of business and I will make sure everyone I know knows that your establishment caters to anyone under the age of 25. If you have money to spend and are a responsible adult, DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Good place to meet friends and have a drink to catch up. good service, great location in Tempe. I did not eat, but had a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were bouncing around Mill Street exploring and having just left El Hefe from dinner where the tacos were the jam but the margaritas not so much, I was searching for a proper drink. This place looked like a good fit for a pub/cocktail scene so we dropped in for a few. The wait staff wasn't overly friendly or fast and the drinks were a little steep for the pour provided but so it goes. The inside was chill and relaxed and the food was likely good from what I saw. They also had a slew of board games to sit and play if you're into that sort of thing. The beer list wasn't huge but it was interesting and they had decent bourbon on hand. Lastly, the patio looked pretty inviting from the quick look I had while trying to find our elusive server. It's worth a looksee."}
{"text":"This may be my first negative review. I generally come here to praise establishments and encourage others to visit. I've been to Handlebar once before and enjoyed it, but today was not good. I'm not writing this to discourage anyone, but more so in hopes that management sees it and addresses it.

My girlfriend and I arrived at about 2:50pm today and asked if they had any specials or happy hour going on. The server said no so we ordered two beers(They have an above average selection, by the way). We began looking through the food menu and noticed happy hour began at 3. Now, while she was technically correct that there was no happy hour at 2:55, I've never been to an establishment that didn't make me aware of an immediately approaching happy hour.

Moving on. We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer. Brutal. They looked and tasted like the dish had been prepared 20 minutes prior. The pretzels were lukewarm and the cheese had already congealed. That was disappointing. Afterwards, the server acknowledged the happy hour once we asked.

We shared a burger and fries. The burger was good, but \"good\" like a Carl's Jr burger is good. Fries were excellent - on point, really. 

Overall, I didn't feel welcome by the server and she didn't seem like she was happy to take care of us. Also, another server legit changed her shirt out in the open in front of everyone. Whatever. Manager on duty was getting them ready for an event tonight so maybe all were distracted, but it was a very distasteful experience. I'm generally never someone that specifically calls out a server, but she had pink hair and I think someone called her \"Mercedes.\"

If you're walking by, walk 20 more feet and hit up Zipps. They never disappoint. Moving forward, when I bike to Tempe, I'll go the extra distance to hit up Four Peaks."}
{"text":"This is a very laid back bar with attentive staff. The food menu is limited but good. My friends who are beer drinkers seems to enjoy the variety. It's a nice place to grab lunch or unwind with friends after work."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly stands out about this place, but it's a solid full bar with a good beer and cocktail selection. Plenty of room/tables to sit at, too - I've never sat outside on the patio, but it looks roomy. They're always pretty busy, which is a good sign! It's a great, chill place to start your night."}
{"text":"We got a gift certificate from my inlaws that she had won and wouldn't use. THANK GOD! This place is a hidden gem, for sure. I had the Gruyere Burger which was amazing (although overcooked- I asked for medium and there was no pink, but it was so good I didn't care) and my husband had the Polish Sausage with saeurkraut and bacon. We had the soft pretzel appetizer and shared a small order of fries. Everything was amazing. Nothing outdid something else...I can't pick a favorite. 

Four stars instead of five because of the wait staff. You should never have to even ask for a drink refill at 2pm in a bar on a Monday, let alone wait 10 minutes to even get the chance to ask while another server walks by your table also and doesn't even look over. Otherwise our experience was great and we will likely be back."}
{"text":"For me, it's a solid beer bar. My husband and I visited during a Sunday HH, when the beer prices are good. It's got an amazing patio which works during the sholder seasons - I saw a few dogs out and about too, so they appear to be dog-friendly. So for me, the atmosphere works, or at least on a lazy afternoon it does! Service was friendly and informative on the local brews on which I typically imbibe.
The fries were well-cooked and not too greasy - Although, it did seem small for the price. It's not a deal-breaker for me because I don't need too many fries to begin with.

I'll be back, maybe during late night to see how much of a party school ASU really is - I'll put my New Orleans-trained liver up to the test."}
{"text":"We came here for the Happy Hour and loved it! They have a great beer selection and good happy hour specials ($2 off beer). They rotate their drafts to have a mix of local and national craft brews. The service was appropriate and quick. The other patrons are my kind of people to talk to."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

The Handlebar in Historic Tempe on Mill is one of my favorite hangouts. 

The Handlebar is a bike friendly American beer garden with 48 beers including local, European & American craft selected by self-proclaimed \"beer geek\" Nick Nitz, a full bar, 8 wines by the glass & beer cocktails. (see pics)

THE MENU 

The menu includes salads, sandwiches, pretzels, hand cut fries, vegetarian & various sausages, which I had. (see pics)

AMBIANCE 

There is indoor/outdoor bar seating & a 2,000 square foot patio with park benches, street lamps & a cozy fire pit. 

Trivia: The wood in the bar is a reclaimed barn from the Midwest brought to Arizona piece by piece. 

I love the diverse crowd that The Handlebar always brings. I have met my attorney friends here, locals, students & my pilot friends as well as some international exchange students from Switzerland.


CONCLUSION 

The Handlebar is a fantastic place to get a beer and hangout with friends or meet new people. 

4/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Go on a relatively slow night on Mill Ave. Bouncer talks to girls for several minutes before letting you inside. No server or if there is one the wait is completely up in the air. Go to the bar to order a beer on draft, wait 8 minutes while the two, then one bartender completely ignores your section of the bar. Upon conversation about said beer, are told they do not have it and then immediately starts to walk away. No questions about what else I wanted, no suggestions for further beer choices, literally is five steps away after he told me they didn't have what I wanted. I'll tentatively say I won't return. They have good beers and events but the staff ruins the experience. I'm sure there are some good employees, sadly those who are not ruin the experience."}
{"text":"A fun chill bar with tasty bar food. 

Parking: Street parking and meters.  We had taken an Uber to get to Tempe and walked over from the ASU Gammage after a show.  

Atmosphere:  Depends on the time.  We went on a Sunday at around 2:45 PM.  It was not too crowded but more people came later.  There were sports on in the inside portion of the bar (none of us care). We sat outside on the patio.  

Service:   The wait staff are attentive but not annoying.

Food:  I ordered the soft pretzels (what I order at almost every bar).  They were delicious. We also ordered fries. My friend got a hot dog and seemed to relish it. My other friend ordered some veggie-based burger. 

Drinks: Cider per usual. Crisp, cold and I drank all of it."}
{"text":"I really like their decor and collection. The bartenders seem to be distracted at times, so this wouldn't be the place you would wanna come alone to grab a drink. To hangout with friends, it's my favorite place on mill. Their mixes are good too."}

{"text":"Came here for a late lunch after a spring training Cubs game. 

Food was pretty good. I had a chicken sandwich and fries. It was happy hour which means half off well drinks. I ordered a margarita and she said \"that doesn't count, it needs to be single pour well drinks\" okay, fine.. I'll have tequila soda water and lime. Great

we sat at the bar so service was good. They have cards against humanity and other games which people around us were playing & it was entertaining to watch- good atmosphere"}
{"text":"For the business traveler. It's Monday afternoon with only a handful of people here, in case you're looking for a crowd. There isn't much going on at this time a day on Mill Ave. Definitely a bar atmosphere as soon as you walk in. Bartenders are chill, very attentive. Cool tshirts, too bad they don't have any for sale. Ordered a classic burger with fries, it was recommended by bartender as one of most popular items. Asked for it medium, got it medium well, but still good. The fries are really good, I got a Thai ketchup with it but you don't even need ketchup that's how good they are. The Thai ketchup is also really good. I got a, what I was told, localish beer....Kilt Lifter. Not bad at all. I'd recommend it, although more pricey than it should be for a burger that's not out of this world."}
{"text":"Nice place with a wide selection of beer and decent food options. A bit overpriced. My pet peeve is being asked to close out my tab because my server's shift has ended. Good for 1 out of 3. Food for server, bad for customer and business."}
{"text":"I don't normally write long reviews, or reviews at all for that matter, but felt that this one was needed.  

I went to The Handlebar this past Friday and when I received my bill there were a couple of drinks that were not supposed to be on there.  When I told the bartender that gave me my bill that there errors, she replied, \"There is nothing I can do about....\"  When I asked for a manager she tried to play it off and say that it was very busy and it would take awhile for him to get to me.  I said that was fine and that I would wait.  She then looked very annoyed and proceeded to talk to her \"manager.\"  He then came over with a piece of paper with his name (John Gallagher) and his number on it.  He told me that it was very busy and asked me if I could call the next day and he would handle it.  It was indeed very busy so I accepted that.

When I tried to call the next day, the number that he had given me was \"Out of service.\" At that point I was annoyed, but gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he had made a mistake.  So I then called the bar and left a message and waited for a call back.......that I never received.  

Today (Sunday) I went into the bar in person to talk to a manager.  When I explained my situation I was told, \"There is no John Gallagher that works here.  He worked for The Canteen 2-3 months ago.\"  The employee LIED to me and gave me a false name and number!  The manager then proceeded to ignore what I was saying and act like I was making all of this up!

With the manager refusing to listen to my story (even though I presented him with the paper with the name and number that his employee gave to me) I just left and called my bank.  I filed a claim with them and they gave me money back, thankfully.  

I will NEVER spend a dime nor step foot in this place again.  I can deal with bad service somewhere, but when an employee gives false information to a customer regarding a billing mistake that was the bars fault, that is not okay."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the service is fantastic. Today we met the manager, Nick, and he was so helpful, kind, and attentive. This place has great atmosphere, an excellent drink menu, and delicious food. When you are on Mill, the Handlebar is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this bar but tonight's experience was one that rubbed me the wrong way. My friends and I were out tonight and trying to enjoy a few beers before a friend moves out of the country. He ordered a Shirley temple along with another friend's dirty Shirley Temple and the bartender was instantly irritated. He walked away, rolled his eyes and shook his head. It was disappointing to see as a fellow bartender. He returned with a cocktail bucket of Shirley temple along with the same size dirty Shirley. He then didn't take much time to take other orders from the rest of the party. I stayed to reconcile and ask for a full size soda and he seemed to judge the fact that we were still ordering a soda. As a bartender myself, I know money is money. We were willing to pay and tip. His rudeness made me and my friends feel unhappy in this restaurant."}
{"text":"HAPPY HR starts at 3PM.....

I really need to start a Happy Hour list on Mill Ave for Professionals.  My goal for 2014.

Handlebar is a great place to grab a beer, so if you can get a seat at the bar ...grab a stool. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and they have a great selection on tap. The waitresses are like a box of chocolates....you never know what you'll get.  It's hit or miss on the waitress service.

They have a great patio very inviting, plus it's pet and bike friendly.   

Back to HH.   3-6:30pm and 3 bucks off beer, wine and well.  Great deal.  They can accommodate large parties....wink, wink, work groups.  Great place for happy hour after work with co-workers."}
{"text":"Food decent,  but service is dismal.  And don't take the beer list at your table to be the truth. It is far from accurate."}
{"text":"On a strip of bars catering to a college-age crowd, this modern American beer garden with a large patio that is friendly to both dog and bike, offers a fantastic selection of draft beers ranging from Austrian to Belgian to Arizonan.

This is also one of the only places in the valley, that I have discovered, that offers beer cocktails.  Try the signature HANDLEBAR SHANDY with Stiegl Goldbrau lager, San Pellegrino Limonata, Agave Nectar, and a sprig of Rosemary to top it off.  For $6 this is an outstanding value.  

The space itself is open and inviting, combining rustic wooden table and bartops, exposed brick on walls and ceilings, and a lot of natural light coming in from the centerpiece of the room - the bar - which is 60 feet long and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  

The food here is made to order in the cozy little grilling area situated in the corner of the bar.  Keep this in mind when coming here on a busy night - you might wait a while for your food.  But luckily the menu is simple and consists of local gourmet bratwurst, polish sausage, italian, and a smoked turkey sausage.  For $5 you can select up two toppings such as sauerkraut or pickled fresno peppers.  For sides you have the option of regular or sweet potato hand cut fries, and for $3 with a dipping sauce of your choice they are unbeatable.  Highly recommend the decadent bleu cheese bacon dip!  It also tastes amazing on the burger as well as the brat.

The kitchen is open late night for food, which beats getting a pizza or taco on Mill after a night of carousing.

Weekly events are Scrabble nights on Mondays, Ladie's night on Tuesdays, Trivia night on Wednesdays

Great neighborhood bar, great place to stop in for lunch or a late night bite, great place for beers!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place in the afternoons or before, say 10pm on a Thursday through Saturday night. 

The place has a great ambiance, the servers and bartenders ROCK IT and the drinks are perfect. As a vegetarian, the food isn't exactly what I look for in a \"restaurant,\" but this ain't no restaurant so my expectations are for bar food and those expectations are met.

That being said, as much as I LOVE this place, if you're over 22 and you're not into chest-bumping, the \"OH MY GAWDS!\" and the young adult hormones raging vibe, let's find a hookup tonight or else, then stay away from this place on Thursday, Friday or Saturday nights at all costs! The service is still outstanding, but you'll start feeling all closed in and like you're in a bad 80s Porky's film. 

Other than that, go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is cool, but everything about this place stenches of mediocrity. The service is below average; seriously, we waited 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, really? The food was okay; nothing special. I would be just as happy with In-and-Out. I am not sure this place is worth all the hype."}
{"text":"The handlebar is an ok bar. The atmosphere is casual with a seat yourself policy at the door.
The place wasn't overly busy when I arrived. Me and my friend were there for a special beer release event. We ordered a couple regular drinks and a couple of the tasters. None of the beers had any prices on the menu. The menu was a hanging chalkboard. Most of the way through our visit they added prices on to the chalkboard and to our dismay we discovered that many of the prices did not match what the server told us when we ordered. We found when the tabs were delivered at the end of the night all of the prices we were charged matched what they later wrote on the board instead of what we were told at the time we ordered them. Additionally our server never brought us the waters we asked for and also advised us that one of the beers was tapped out even though it was supposed to be part of the event (which hadn't even been going 30 minutes yet) and the place was not very busy. This told me they obviously had been selling this beer well before the listed start time for the event. 
I did have a couple appetizers while I was there. They have Pretzel Knots on the menu but be aware these are not soft pretzels, they are literally the mini crunchy pretzels you can buy in the snack packs at the grocery store served with a side of beer cheese. We also ordered a side of french fries as well. We got the 1lb side order to share which came with 2 dipping sauces. I chose beer cheese for my dipping sauce for the fries as well which I'm glad I did because the beer cheese turned out to be quite good. Overall a very mediocre experience all things considered."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers on tap and in bottles and cans. Food is great- I usually get a bratwurst with grilled onions and sauerkraut, fries with beer cheese and the tomato basil aioli. Tonight was an eclectic mixture of rap videos and national geographic on the tvs. A+"}
{"text":"Pros: Wonderful beer variety, tasty foods, and great mixed drinks! I love all the bike racks and the fact that they are dog friendly. 

Cons: Most of the staff is friendly and awesome, but some of the waitresses don't have the best service/ attitude (Yes I mean waitresses, not waiters. It's unfortunate but true). If you can, just sit at the bar. 

If you haven't been in a while check it out! They have some new delicious items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good addition to Mill Ave for sure.  I like that its not your typical college bro bar. Good place for day drinking and Sunday fundays."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service...ever!!  Slow service, uninterested employees, bland food...such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Great service, cool atmosphere.  Can get noisy when it is crowded.  Nice patio out back."}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere, great mixed beer drinks. Had the sweet potato fries.... they were def. soft and savory. Great service from the waitress we had. She def. made the experience 10 times better. I only wish the mixed beer drinks came in pints instead of the tulip glass, for the guys."}
{"text":"Love this place, a great addition to Mill.

I love what they did with this space. Long bar to one side, big tables to the other. Nice patio w. large windows that open for outside bar seating.

They started w/ a basic menu: brats, sausages, burgers, fries and theyre adding and changing things gradually. The brats w/ grilled onions is almost always my 1st choice. Their fries are soooo good. Be warned that they dont come w/ the burgers, they do , however, come w/ your choice of delicious aiolis. I love the black pepper ranch and the bacon blue cheese (and i usually hate blue cheese!). I will say, if you order a burger make sure its cooked how you asked it to be. The one time I strayed from my brat, i ordered my burger midwell, and got it mid rare. Sending it back seemed a chore as the waitress didnt understand my complaint.

The waitresses are not great, but the bartenders are stellar. Theyre always willing to help you find your perfect beer. Very attentive, talkative, and give all around great service, even when its crazy busy.

And the beer selection, yum. It changes so dont expect to find something youve had their prior on your next visit. Ive made that mistake more than once.

I really hope this place survives!"}
{"text":"Last night \"Sergio\" turned my husband away from the door for being \"drunk\". He was totally sober and our DD. Sergio claimed to have seen my husband consume alcohol. We had just come out of Fat Tuesdays with a large party of about 17 adults. So I'm not sure where or when he witnessed said consumption of alcohol in another location.  I suppose Sergio either didn't want customers who have real jobs and money to spend and maybe would have preferred some college kids. I do not recommend this bar if you are a responsible adult. They seem to cater to a younger crowd."}
{"text":"Always a good time when I'm here. The food is good, drinks are good, sports environment is A1 but I gave it 4 stars for service. Service is slow. Slow. Slow. But the people are so nice that it doesn't completely ruin it for me. 

I highlight recommend everything on the menu seeing as I've had almost everything! You're not going to go wrong with anything unless the run out of buns like they have before which is completely inconvenient.(another reason I didn't give a 5 star). How do you run out of buns when you sells burgers? I guess there's a first time for everything!"}
{"text":"So nice to get back to hanging out in Tempe, and the temptation came from the opening of The Handlebar & Grill.  After my inquiring on the website for location info, I was warmly responded to by the owner, Julian Wright, obviously a dedicated restaurant owner and hard working man who makes you feel very appreciated and welcomed.  
I love big patio spaces, and the extra draw for me is theirs being dog friendly.  This is a great place for all bike riders as well since they have several nice bike racks through out.  Their outdoor patio space is plentiful and very relaxing as their attempt to establish themselves with the aire of the friendly European bier gardens was a great idea which Julian seems to have executed quite well!  The \"garage door\" windows around the building, allow for a nice open, yet comfort-savy atmosphere; similar to a nice \"gathering of friends\" feel even if you don't live in the neighborhood.  Much to my delight it was more of an adult, relaxed and enjoying great beer, type of atmosphere rather than being over run by partying coed's 
The food menu is limited right now, but they have just opened recently, so I am sure more good things will come as they adjust to their \"re planned kitchen\" size. (Sadly the DOH or other municipal entity apparently kiboshed their plans of an outdoor grill. Shame on them!).  Regardless the small kitchen, they seem to make quite good use of many nice local products.  The sausages that we tried were wonderful, as well as their fries and many deelishis dipping sauces.  But my ultimate favorite... The amazing pretzel braids!!  Wonderful fresh baked greatness that melts in your mouth!
They have a fantastic array of beers, (and wine, and cocktails) served in nice glassware with fresh carafe of ice water that is frequently refilled, (something I VERY MUCH appreciated on a very hot day!).  
The decor was very nice, very comfortable, with reclaimed woods, etc.  Many nice little details that I really noticed, and very much appreciated.  
The staff was plentiful and absolutely wonderful.  I simply couldn't ask for more.  I could have easily spent all afternoon and evening there.  I had considered taking the light rail from the East valley simply because I don't like to have to fight to find parking, but I drove there instead and found plenty of parking in the 7th street \"brick house\" building which you can enter from 6th.  
I will be back often!  I LOVED the food, drink, people, and atmosphere!  We plan on also making this a \"Once a Month Green Sustainability Meetings\" place as well. (GS meetings being an inside joke for coworkers)
My only dislike, (and a minor one at that) was the patron's hand washing sinks and mirrors between the men's and women's restrooms.  Although spotless and well appointed, they are \"shared\". There is no mirror/sink area privately in the Ladies room.  I prefer to wash my hands, fix my hair, reapply lipstick, or adjust my clothing in private, rather than with the male patrons and/or a slightly viewable area to the dining room.
Do yourself a favor and be sure to try this new establishment in downtown Tempe on Mill.  It is a \"Multifaceted Gem\" for sure.  Thanx Julian!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and of course I had to hunt down the hipster bar. Cute bearded dudes, great food, and half price beer specials for happy hour."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time that I caught this place but the less people the better for me.  I just visited for the first time last night and I'm hooked.  For the off cue nights where I want to snack on some brats and beer SOLD!!!!  Absolutely ingenious to have the brats and beer theme on a college dominated scene.  The atmosphere is a bit classy for the college scene in my personal opinion but maybe it will harness refinement in these young bucks HA!  The beer selection is pretty broad and has a pick for someone and anyone.  They've also got some fine.....spirits and liquers!  It's Mill and I was surprised with some of the selection which will make for a lovely blurry evening soon enough.  Another great note is the space of this place.  It's pretty open and airy which is awesome compared to the other places on Mill which are reminiscent to a college party basement.  My bud had picked a tasty delish dark beer to go with the hot italian sausage and from there I am now in like!  Fo sho I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Worse bouncer service i have ever encountered. Thought i was drunk after drinking two beers and let in my friend who was wasted over me. Eric the bouncer should not be working in the industry. Don't go to Handlebar sober because they won't let you in."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times with my Tempe friends. Limited food. Burgers and dogs are good here, Their French fries come with assorted sauces, I recommend the spicy catsup. Their beer is really great, cold, super service and there is nothing better than sitting outside with the pooch. But they said they are limiting dogs because someone got bit. Badly, I guess. Leave Cujo home. Great place to hang with friends. Real chill staff. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Rode out to the handlebar for my first time this afternoon due to great recommendations from friends. Indulged in a cartel coffee nitro stout and a can of Prescott achocollpse porter thanks to Brandon's suggestion. Good, drink, service, and atmosphere was perfect. I'd have stayed longer if I hadn't fell victim to the lunch food coma. Come on over here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is nice place, great for people to get a drink or hang out side. I feel like you wouldn't go to this bar for dancing , or to get turnt up , and if you are looking for school of Rock crowd or a cultural mixing pot this may not be your bar on the average night. 

The crowd , seems to be a mixture of college students and older (classic dad's with teenage at home) age groups. Seems like you get college students who get dressed up to sit at a table and hangout with good friends. And on flip older folk doing the same but in shorts, hats and some relaxing running sneakers. 

But I. Honestly feel like this bar does one thing great and that is space. They really do give every group space from each other. This isn't a bar where you meet people , it seems like one where you bring you own group and live in your own space and this bar does a great job in creating that space. Tons of tables , and even more outside. Plenty room to move around but also  plenty room to fit multiple big groups . 

Didn't try the food, and I actually went a little weak and had their ciders but good selection on tap ."}
{"text":"Always more SECURITY (as stated on their shirts) than actual staff, and every time I've been there, which has been three times now, every one of them is barking orders at you:  FORM A LINE.  GET AWAY FROM THERE.  STEP BACK.  With the mood lighting and custom decor, the place seems to be trying to be swanky, but, even if their patrons are a group of well dressed mid-30 year olds, they're treated like cattle.  Really, who wants to be served drinks by a riot squad?  Ironically, this place is bicycle themed, and a local bicycle organization I'm involved in made it one of our stops on an organized ride.  We took about fifty people there, on bikes, after contacting the management and making arrangements.  The welcome was far from warm (\"GO AROUND!  YOU CAN'T COME IN THIS WAY!\"), but as we were staging our riders to leave, security basically flipped out on us, acting like they were ready to attack us, screaming at us, and running around like angry apes because we couldn't queue all of riders to leave instantly.  One guy screamed \"YOU AREN'T EVEN MOVING.  I TOLD YOU TO GET OFF OF OUR FENCE\".  We had three riders that had squeezed up next to the fence to allow a crowd to go by in front, and the other 30 odd that were ready were between the bushes on the other side of the sidewalk, to keep a clear path.  Bizarrely, bar security was being hostilely possessive of the sidewalk that wasn't even what they are leasing.  Our entire stop was 45 minutes.  There was no loitering.  I have a friend who works here and who I consider to be good with people.  If I were going to be biased, it would be in favor of the place.  All of the riders moved as soon as the gaggle of people going down the sidewalk had passed.  We were a group of grown adults, but not even college students should be treated this way.  I'm old enough to remember when college students on Mill Avenue weren't.  Long Wongs, which required physical intervention on occasion, never conducted itself like this before its Mill Ave location was bulldozed.  Even Casey Moores is pretty good at being more level headed than their patrons rather than trying to out dickhead them.  \"Give me your money and do what we say\" never sat well with me.  There are way too many other places that are actually good -- better beer, better beer selection, better prices, and run not like a prison that I can go to.  If this gets suggested for rides in the future, I'm vetoing it."}
{"text":"I love this bar! Mostly when the ASU students are gone for the summer (even though I am one). Great beers on tap and in cans/bottles, awesome atmosphere, and top-notch friendly service. The patio offers misters and a decent amount of shade and is also dog friendly, while the inside has a cool clean look about it. I have yet to try anything food wise, but the menu looks extremely enticing! They also host trivia every monday night, so this has become our new favorite night to frequent the Handlebar!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends bar hopping after the ASU game. The bartender made a mean whiskey & Coke and the beer selection was pretty on point. I liked the rustic/Old West design. You can't go wrong with many of the bars on Mill, and I recommend this one to anybody who doesn't want to walk the entire length of the street/doesn't want to get smushed at El Hefe or Cue."}
{"text":"I've been here for drinks a couple times and it was fine. Cheap drinks, mellow atmosphere and not too noisy. However the last time we went (a group of 8), our server seemed to not care whatsoever. Two of us came late and everyone had received their drinks before, but the server took forever to come back and ask if we wanted anything. We decided to try the food, some variations of grilled cheese sandwiches and bacon fries, and after what seemed to be 20 minutes, some of us received our food- cold, with hard cheese. A few people in our group hadn't gotten their food until the others had almost finished (they insisted we start without them). When they finally got their food, it was also cold, but decided not to send it back just so we could leave. After all that, I will probably only go there for drinks from now on."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place on mill, but its okay. The food is alright and the prices are a little high. I have to admit I like the wrap around patio out front,"}
{"text":"I enjoy handlebar's Moscow mule, it's my starter drink on mill. Their fries are also pretty good and if you've got a buzz going on you should try their marshmallow cinnamon sauce for the fries."}
{"text":"OMG, the Mojitos are AMAZING. Sweet potato fries with Basil Aioli is to die for. Will be coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place to chill and get a nice beer, compared to some of the other places on Mill. The decor is very modern and hipster. Great patio and location for people watching. 

We ordered the pretzels with beer cheese which were nothing special. The beer cheese was fine, but when asked about the stone ground mustard that the menu boasted.... the server gestured sadly to the Heinz, Grey Poupon, and Gulden's on the table. Um, that's not stone ground, Handlebar. My grilled cheese (which was reportedly nominated for some best grilled cheese award?) was meh as well. I used a good amount of stone ground mustard (jk, it was Gulden's) to make it more interesting. I'm still trying to figure out why they charged so much.

They have some very classy beer selections available. I ended up requesting the Noche Dulce vanilla porter. The server accidentally brought out a strawberry ale, which was surprisingly tasty. A really great summer beer. When I got my Noche Dulce though... perfection. Deliciously hearty and great flavor. 

All in all, I wouldn't flock here for food. I wouldn't flock here for the service. I would stop in for a beer at the bar before a date and then gtfo with my bearded, glasses adorned date on his tandem bike."}
{"text":"A very unique menu with excellent food.  The patio lends a nice change to indoor dining.  The mist system worked well to cut down on the Arizona heat.  While the service was not the best, the food more than compensated.  We will return.

BTW, this would have easily been 5 stars if the service was better."}
{"text":"Beers at the bar with good friends.
Noisy. Loud and ASU students hitting it hard already.. couldn't hear each other talk, which is ok sometimes but not what www were expecting.
Nice venue. 
Nice selection of beers and cider."}
{"text":"Fun environment, and love they have huckleberry vodka. The waitress was great but our only complaint is they will charge you wrong, at the bar, we got two $6 drinks and our tab was $16. It's not a big difference, but it's still over 3/4th's another drink. I won't come back here again."}
{"text":"I enjoy this Mill Ave spot for a good brew after work. We typically come during happy hour and the seating is plentiful during that time. Love that they have seating at the bar outdoors and love even more that they have Stiegl on tap. My cousin got me on this German lager and I enjoy when I can find a place that serves it. Since we are normally at the bar the service is usually quick and they keep an eye on us. 

The last time I came was for a birthday party. It was one of those few chilly nights in Tempe and they had warned us we might be outside, but they had heaters. Turned out they were able to reserve a few tables inside, so that was a nice surprise. They assigned 1 main server to us, but also had 2 others with knowledge of the group and they did a wonderful job. 

I have only ever tried the fries and they were good, but I can't comment on the other food. Will have to give it a whirl sometime. This is a nice option for graduates or a working professional as it doesn't get overrun with young students."}
{"text":"The garlic fries were delicious, would have liked to try the Thai Ketchup that everyone seems to love from the reviews  but wasn't offered it...it was dark and hard to read the menu so i went with recommended aoili. We were there on a Thursday and they had 2 for 1 Jamison or Green tea shots which were very good, i only sipped on them, once again because I'm a little to old for shots. Our waitress was nice, we had 6 to 8 people at our table at different times during the evening. The patio was nice even on a cool January evening with the heat lamps...we're from Montana so it was a treat to sit on a patio. The Crowd in the whole area was very young,however the night turned out great even for us middle agers"}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks after having a not so great experience at another Tempe bar. The waiter and bartender were extremely knowledgeable about their beer selection. They even let us taste test using different glassware for a couple of our beers. Also had an order of the pretzels and beer cheese. They were excellent as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection.. Awesome patio. The portabello mushroom sandwich was fantastic. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good beer and a casual place to hang out. Food menu isn't extensive but it's all delicious!"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for them is the beer selection, which while decent, is not enough for me to put up with the horrible service and attitude of the staff.  I don't often like to write negative reviews on here, but I did not have a great experience here.  We had made arrangements here for an after work function and had made reservations (or so we thought) for space to accommodate 20 people.  Upon arriving, no such space existed for our group.  There is a fire pit in the back of this place, which was apparently reserved for another party.  OK no big deal because there must be some other area for us right?  One of the staff, I think he was a manager, told us that he had our reservation but we didn't specifically request the fire pit only \"space for 20 people.\"  That was the last I heard from the manager and there was no effort to help us find a space for our group.  On top of that, I had to go to the bar to get my drink and we never had a server come to our table.  Not a great experience."}
{"text":"After a round of Disc Golf, I wanted a good beer at a new place. I've driven by here so may times I had to give it a try. 
     My friend had the Gruyere Burger and loved it. My granddaughter (7) had a Cheese Burger with nothing else. She is the pickiest eater I know. Amazingly enough she ate the whole thing. Her burger really smelled good. 
     I had the fish and chips. Which were also very nice. Wonderful fish under a thin layer of crust. Perfect. I hate to much crust on fish. I feel like they are hiding something. The fish and tartar sauce were wonderful. 
     We all had the fries with our meal. They have a wonderful seasoning on them. If they cooked them crisp like the Belgians do, they'd have the best fries in town.
     The beer selection is amazing. You can even get obscure beers and ales in 22oz bottles. Some are not so cheap but if you want to say you've try this or that to brag to friends about your beer snobbishness, then this is the place.
     My next trip will include one of those beers as a treat, though I've already had the best beer in the world. I'm not snobby, just lucky to know good brews."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and bite. Came in with some friends, had a couple of beers with fries and a pretzel. The pretzel was good but the true find was the Thai Ketchup dipping sauce. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Handlebar is a nice combination of good food and a great alcohol selection, all at a decent price. Their atmosphere is what truly sets them apart, they take a much more laid back chill kind of scene rather than the typical noise of mill, and because of this has become a staple visit each time we hit the bars. 

Their food is very reasonable, and their kitchen is open late (midnight, I believe) so it's a great stop for food and drinks later in the evening. Even at later hours they are still full service, so you can get a table and be waited on which is pretty awesome.

Even though you can get waited on, don't expect amazing service on these busy nights. Of course it's hard to manage on mill on a Friday night, so I consider it no major fault of their own, just be prepared to have a few extended waits between ordering and getting your food/drink. Also, on these busier nights (Friday, Saturday) they tend to focus more on a \"clubby\" kind of scene and pump up the music and rearrange the tables. It feels like they don't quite know what they're going for when the bar is in this mode, but all in all it's still a classic stop if you're looking to go to somewhere a little more laid back."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place yesterday on a beautiful afternoon in Tempe to meet up with two clients and go over some paperwork. Gail our server took very good care of us.

Been here in the past, the liquor selection, beers on tap and the food have always been great. This trip included an order of their Fish & Chip, and the tuna, and one of their chicken sandwiches, all with their awesome seasoned fries.

I paired my meal with a Kilt Lifter (I know, I'm boring, but I like it) while the girls ordered Ballast Point Sculpin, and a Oskar Blues G'Knight respectively. Seems I'm the odd one out without an IPA... 

All and all a good place to pop in for lunch. I have noticed like any other place located on Mill, parking can be a problem from time to time."}
{"text":"Fries were Awesome. I wish they had more lagers to choose from, but its a great place to hang out with your friends"}
{"text":"Sad to say but the only thing they have going for them is booze and fries. My husband and I arrived at 4:15pm. We waited for a server for 10 minutes. When she arrived, we ordered immediately. From there it took 35 minutes to get a the tri-color quinoa salad with chicken and a chicken sandwich with fries. The salad was absolutely awful. The arugula was bad and over all not a good salad for $13 (chicken added). My husbands chicken sandwich was very dry and over cooked. Fries were the best part about the entire thing. We did feel bad for the waitress as she was running the entire floor while the manager just stood and watched. Sad to say we won't be back. Head here for drinks and fries but nothing else."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars back in the day, and still occasionally hit up Handlebar. Love the beer, love the staff, love the music. If you like laid back bars with a big patio that don't have EDM blasting in your ear, Handlebar's your place. They also have old school games that you can bring to your table which is awesome, and I've always enjoyed the crowd of people here."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my lunch break and had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries, so good! One of the best veggie burgers I've had. I was with a group of 6 and it wasn't too busy, yet our food took a while to come out. However, I can tell everything was fresh and made to order, so that made up for it.  No pics ... ate too fast, lol!"}
{"text":"I was referred here by a friend and was happy to find a cool industrial-type bar with good food and a really awesome beer selection. I always like finding Belgian style ales on tap as they are so much better than out of the bottle. Don't know what I mean? Buy a bottle of Orval. Drink it. Now go to Handlebar and get Orval on Tap. Drink it. Compare. BE HAPPY!"}
{"text":"The nice thing about writing reviews is one can come back and rethink an original review and in this case, my rating has to go up from 3 to 4 stars. It seems like Handlebar has just improved over time, offering a wider selection of food (fish and chips and a number of vegetarian items) and the beer selection continues to stay varied and interesting with some excellent happy hour specials (I believe 3 pm to 6:30 pm). I do like that they work on serving each type of beer in a glass appropriate to that style of beer, something that stands out as a differentiator in regards to their approach to beer and they seem to now have a wider selection of Belgian beers in the large bottles.

I went early on a Friday evening with my father and while the music was elevated it was not too loud, and the music was interesting and varied. We sat at the long bar and the wait staff was friendly and regularly checked on us so our water glasses and my beer glass were  refreshed as needed. I had two beers from the happy hour list, which has about 10 or 12 craft beers so nice to take advantage of the lower prices without feeling one is missing out on a quality selection.

All I can say, when I go to see a movie on Mill, I always seem to end up at Handlebar for a beer and a bite so I think I can clearly say I fall into the fan category. I also like that the place is good for people watching, big outside patio and an open area and a long bar so that you can almost always find a space there early in the evening."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but I haven't tried the food. The drinks are unique and very tasty. Great staff. Must try in Mill!!"}
{"text":"Worst service and greeting I've ever had.

Bouncer was a complete asshole and the hospitality manager did nothing to help.

It was unfortunates to be met with such disrespect and lack of value when I was/am apart of the private event that the venue was hosting.

Devalued me as a human; no one deserves to be treated less than they're worth.

Don't give this establishment your service or money.

If I could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"My friend picked me up from the airport around midnight on a Monday and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to stop by Mill Ave on the way back and grab a beer or two. We wanted to try a place we had never been before, so we wandered into Handlebar around 1am and found the place empty except for a bartender and waitress. We knew it was late on Monday night, but I don't think either of us were expecting to be the only ones in the joint.

We sat up at the bar and the bartender started telling us about their Brown Bag special on Mondays. For $8, you get a domestic tall boy, a shot of Fireball/Jager/Jameson, and your choice of either a popsicle, ice cream sandwich, or pack of cigarettes. I had never had anything like it before and I elected to pass that night, but I was intrigued and might have to go back to give it a shot.

Anyways, you'll find a pretty wide selection of beer at Handlebar, and our bartender was more than happy to walk my friend through the differences between IPAs and ales. He let us sample a handful of different chocolate-y beers before we settled on our drinks of choice, and he even handed us the remote to change the TV channel. It's a nice spot on Mill if you want a break from the typical party vibe on the avenue."}
{"text":"I rarely write anything negative but we have to be factual. Great ambience and location, but service needs a little work.  The food is slow and also not good. Among the 3 different ones we've ordered it was only the pretzels that was worth the credit.  Hope they get better staff and service, as there are lots of bars in Mill Ave."}
{"text":"I originally liked the Handlebar for their great selection of beers and 1/2 priced apps on happy hour. My work group has been there several times for happy hour and the patio is great for accommodating big groups. The roll up walls are nice when the weather is cool creating one open space so the inside and outside flow together. 

I went back for lunch the other day and all I can say is \"QUINOA BURGER!\" I can't believe how delicious it was, packed with Cheddar Cheese, Carrots, Zucchini, Feta, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and Cucumber Dill Sauce. Absolutely amazing. Of course I added bacon to enhance the experience so it definitely wasn't a vegetarian option. 

I'm adding Handlebar to my regular rotation for Mill Ave lunches."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, with descriptions for those of us who want to learn more about the art of beer tasting! The brat was delicious, but the bun was a little dry. Great happy hour & fun atmosphere- would come back for sure! A welcome change from the typical Mill Ave restaurants/bars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Handlebar is absolutely fantastic. The patio is magazine-ad perfect.. you seriously feel like you're in a hip urban environment, doing hip, urban things... and in hip, urban style! 
The beer selection is vast.. I don't drink, but I find the beer menu impressive. The food menu is fairly limited, but that's actually a fantastic thing. I've so often eaten at beer focused spots that have giant menus with nothing but really terrible food to offer.  Handlebar's selection is burgers, fries, pretzels, salads, and sausage sandwiches. REALLY TASTY burgers, fries, pretzels, salads, and sausage sandwiches!! The meats are locally sourced! The flavors are brave. The fries come with a variety of dipping sauces, and each of them are exquisite.. the fries themselves are at least the best I've ever had. Really. They are. I have never made such a proclamation in regard to fries! So good! I guess they recently revamped the pretzels. I did not have their previous iteration, but the new ones are 3 sticks of carbtastic glory. They are served with a spicy mustard, and BEER CHEESE to dip in.. and the BEER CHEESE = the truth! I'd seriously eat it off of dirt. It's that good! 
Be sure to stop in on Wednesday nights, around 8pm.  Team trivia, headed up by an actual host! Fun times, and super fantastic prizes!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to post this review for a while:

I hate giving a place a bad review, especially after they just open. Luckily Yelp has an \"edit review\" option, so when I come again, I will have the option of changing the star rating if I deem it appropriate. We came here for dinner and drinks a week into opening. The place itself is in a neat building on Mill Avenue. We took a seat on the rear patio which offers great views of the surrounding Tempe architecture and nightlife.

First and foremost, our service was excellent. I don't remember the gentleman's name, but our server was a very well-spoken redhead and was not going to leave work that day without making sure we left satisfied. There was a reason he had to do that though...

We ordered brats (hey why not?) and they were still frozen. FROZEN. The place just opened, we're sure that it's just new cooks getting used to new equipment and all that fun stuff, but after we sent it back (we insisted they just throw our brats back on the grill), they were still frozen. By this time, we were pretty upset, made worse by the fact the \"regular sized\" french fries were smaller than the Value Size fries at McDonalds (granted Handlebars' fries tasted better by a slim margin). Our redhead server apologized profusely. He offered to comp the whole meal and give us brand new food from scratch (the latter of which we took him up on) which was a great gesture. The new food was hot as could be (finally) and after we resisted the free meal, he still insisted he buy our next drink round. He even dragged a heat lamp over closer to us. Cool, thanks for making this situation right.

All in all, I look forward to coming back again after they iron out all the lovely bumps in the road that come with opening a new business on Mill (where many new business go to fail miserably)."}
{"text":"Was in on a slow Sunday night and took about 3 minutes to even be recognized.  Place looks nice and food was so so.  Would probably try this place out again and give it another chance"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great selection of beers, wines and cocktails - garlic fries are delis and HH is totally worth it.  Service is always friendly but not intrusive."}
{"text":"A largely concrete, no-frills bar with good pub food and a spacious patio for all your needs. 

Things I like: The beer and cocktail selection. One of their specials consisted of a shot of whisky, a PBR, and a cigarette. That's rugged AF, but it really gives this place character!

I really enjoyed booze options from our local distillery, which I sadly don't see often enough compared to all the hometown beer flying off shelves.

The food wasn't that bad, but I think the fries shined above anything else. It's cool to eat those for dinner right? 

Overall, this is a real safe option for happy hour that won't leave you disappointed."}
{"text":"The feel of this bar is different from the rest of the bars on Mill Ave.  It's more relaxing than \"yeah lets party and get wasted\".  They make a phenomenal moscow mule, bartenders are very attentive and super nice.  Will make this a first stop for all our nights out on Mill Ave"}
{"text":"As a new Phoenician and a parent whose income now goes to supporting ASU and the area (hello Mill St bars and restaurants), my weekends are filled with exploring and determining repeat spots. Handlebar had been on my list as, coming from Los Angeles, it seemed to have that personality...at least from the street. Inside experience, not so much. Ah Handlebar, you deeply disappointed me and admittedly, I'll not be returning. With other options all over Mill, this place is sadly lacking in customer service and professionalism. Example 1: Bartenders need to learn to pour (a stout shouldn't be served half full of head and I can't even begin to tell you how much beer was wasted from half assed pouring. If I were an owner or manager, I would be ticked. I cringe at the amount of good been that's been sacrificed to the drain because of lack of experience) Example 2: when a customer says \"excuse me could I have a glass of water?\" the response shouldn't  be \"well, do you have a server??\". The correct answer in order to provide a positive customer experience would be \"sure, let me grab that for you\" (dumbfounded) Example 3: when a table of 4 orders food and the establishment isn't packed to capacity, said table shouldn't have to wait over an hour and a half for their food only to have it come and need to send it back when the cheese in congealed, sauces are hardened, chicken is fridge temperature cold, bread (untoasted) is hard. A server should be aware of the fact their customers are still sitting there with an empty table. Admittedly, she made sure we had our beers full, but when you're hungry, you expect to have a fork full of tasty vittles. Alas...not tasty and no vittles. 
Overall unbelievably unpleasant  experience, and this is from someone who hates to complain about service."}
{"text":"Some good things and some bad things about this place, first the good-happy hour prices are good 1/2 price beer and wine, the bad-normal prices are too high with small pours.  Food was cheap but lacking any real pizzazz, you pay for what you get. The biggest negative was slow service. 10 minutes to take an order and then another 10 to deliver drinks isn't acceptable.  This place is not related to the Handlebar in Mesa or Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, it was trendy and in the middle of Mill Ave...but their food was disgusting! They only had half a dozen items on their lunch menu, so I got a regular cheeseburger and fries, medium. 

The fries were ok, nothing special, but the burger was so gross I couldn't even finish a 1/4 of it. The meat was like frozen cafeteria patties, and was mostly this weird white stuff (fat??) It was cooked well done and had zero flavor. 

For a place that offers such few items, you'd think they'd make them amazingly. Not this place. I'll take a pass next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Place is good. Ambience great. Personally love it bcs of the big Belgian ale beer selection they have, even though they are super expensive. The place is really loud especially if you sit inside. Practically no food though, just burger, sausages and fries? I get that its a grill, but seriously, absolutely nothing for vegetarians?. I ordered a side order of sauerkraut for lack of options, and was the worst one I had tasted ever! And oh the big guys acting as cleaners just try to take Ur food away while u r still eating!"}
{"text":"I've only come here late at night (past midnight). They've always been nice, the bouncers are super friendly! They're even kind enough to get their fire pit going every time I ask for it! 
They also serve the white chocolate ale (which I'm a fan of!) 
As for the music, it's a hit and miss. Sometimes you get some good jams, and there are times when it's been some weird instrumental techno. I prefer when they play more 90s music.. it keeps it different from the other bars on mill. And I love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"okay, so i don't go out much, but when i do i always go here! the bartenders are pretty nice.. but mainly i really like the atmosphere here! it's pretty laid back and not your typical annoying Mill ave place. if you're looking for a fun place that isn't a super clubby atomosphere, i would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"I didn't have very high expectations for this bar considering I went to another bar opening down the street (world of beers) and left unimpressed. But I was pleasantly surprised by Handlebar not only for their selection of beers but for their wonderful service. As soon as we stepped into the bar the bouncers were incredibly polite and after we got in our bartender Ryan was THE best. He started with asking us what we usually look for in a beer and what we usually get. I said I like Blue Moon and the bf said his favorite beer- Four Peaks \"Kilt Lifter.\" He then went on to recommend the perfect beers for us; he explained each beer with great detail and was very convincing. The bf first drank the Celebrator Doppelback and then a Monk's Cafe Flemish and loved them both (I'm not a fan of the beer the bf likes, but even I liked them). For me, since I like the light, but flavorful taste of Blue Moon' drank their Leffe Blonde and it was amazing. I should have known this was going to be a great bar since I am already a fan of La Bocca Pizzeria and Canteen, who are run by the same owners. I haven't tried the food yet but I definitely recommend everyone to give it a try!"}
{"text":"We tried this on Friday. Fantastic beer menu. The cocktails were unique mixing beer and alcohol. Makes me want to become a mixologist."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time--at 3 pm on a Thursday. For what it's worth, I think that's probably one of the better times to go. No crowds, no drunk kids, just good beers and yummy pretzels :P The waitress was really sweet and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio to kill a couple of hours.

Overall, The Handlebar is a great place for beers and apps on a lazy afternoon."}
{"text":"1pm on a Tuesday and you're out of fries and sweet potatoes for the day?  That's a good chunk of the selection when your menu consist of MAYBE 10 items.  12 ounce draft pours for $7 of sub-average beers? Not crazy about this place."}
{"text":"My guy friends decided to hang out at this place during a Saturday night, my only night in town.  We came around 11ish PM.  There wasn't really a line, although there were a lot of people inside.  There wasn't a cover for guys/girls.  The music was alright.  Sounded like a mixture of everything along with top 40s.  We found a free table in back and hung out there the whole night.  I drank 2 AMFs and didn't feel much of a buzz...or maybe I did later but didn't realize it lol

It was a good night.  We even had some entertainment going on with some drunk people trying to jump the rail by our table.  I guess the lady was too drunk to realize that she can get in if she could just act normally.  Too bad security came by and made them leave.  For the rest of the night, the guys were trying to pick up on some girls, but I guess they see me and think I'm cock-blocking or something.  Some girls actually had made eye contact with them but they didn't do anything -_-  No game hahaha"}
{"text":"Great new addition to Mill Ave. 

First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)

Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming. 

(sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.)

Def. worth a shot I'd say, and I could see it being a fave HH place."}
{"text":"Good bar.  Good location. The service was quick and the beer was cold.  They have a great happy hour including weekends.  Had the brat; it was pretty good but fell apart.  The fries witht he bacon dipping sauce are great.  Next time I am in tempa I will return."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best bar on mill and the staff are the best! Also Nick is one sexy manager."}
{"text":"Sat for a half an hour and got no service at all. When they finally came to take our order they said the kitchen closed a minute ago. Do not come here!"}
{"text":"A great selection of beer, with a comfortable atmosphere.  Indoor/outdoor seating...the patio is enclosed and well-misted in the summer.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  The Handlebar centrally located in the Mill Ave district."}
{"text":"We waited for 30 minutes and still did not get a waiter... We told one of the workers( I think he was a Busser) that we wanted food and he told us he would get us a server. He did not get us a server and waitresses kept walking right past us. We had nothing on the table and were ignored completely... We left with nothing"}
{"text":"There are so many curmudgeons on yelp!
If you are looking for something like Red Robin or some other kitschy trash heap where you can get your fruity margarita with a bendy straw and a free glass too (!)... this is not the place for you.

Handlebar is a beautiful, new bar on Mill with an amazing selection of craft beers, bottled and draft, and a limited (but tasty) selection of the food.... the phrase \"bar and grill\" is too broad. This is a modern American Pub that also serves locally-crafted (and mighty tasty) pretzels and bratwursts. The waitstaff are all very friendly and accommodating, as are the security team (which is something you don't expect). If you're not used to the Mill club scene, the music will be blaring on weekend nights (you cant even hear you own thoughts!), but that is why it is better as a day-drinking or weekday night haunt. Great beers, great food, a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere (except on Fri & Sat nights). Give Handlebar a try next Tuesday, their Happy Hour is 3.30-6, and the beer is GREAT!

ps- Tyler and Pierce and Kylee are awesome servers. Ask for them."}
{"text":"A group of us went for Happy Hour before the big performance at ASU Gammage.  We all sat in the back patio area.  They sure have an excellent water mist system to cool off.   You might get a little wet if stayed too long in one area.  Hey, who complaining when it's 100+!

I had ordered the Southwest Smoked Turkey Brat with sweet peppers and caramelized onions.  It was spicy yet so good you can't stop eating it.   The PEACH TANDEM must try!  A well balance of beer and cocktail.

It's a great hangout spot.  Good food, beer/wine selection & great service."}
{"text":"The Handlebar is definitely one of my favorite bars to hang out in. Whenever I am in the mood to grab a drink, this is the first place that comes to mind because of how consistently awesome it is. I love that I can come here for a drink or for a beer, since they have several taps that rotate pretty regularly - I'm always impressed with the beer list and can always find something on tap that I'd like to drink. On top of it all, the bartenders are always awesome! If I knew their names I'd give them kudos but usually it's the same two or three that always serve me when I stop in. They're all funny but very attentive as well. I never feel like I have to flag someone down when I need something, because they just know! I love that this isn't the typical party place. Instead, it's a great place to just have a drink and hang out."}
{"text":"Popped in here while milling around on Mill one afternoon. 

My first reaction, wow, love this place! It's a wide open space, with lots of TVs, open windows, and a funky lookin' little joint. The bathroom sinks are fun, but now that I'm sober and thinking about it, I actually don't like picking up a bottle of soap that some dude just picked up after touching his junk...however, I do think using a ketchup bottle as a soap dispenser is cute, it's just not sanitary. 

Anywho, this place is just okay when it comes to food. We ordered a couple of items off the menu and no one was overwhelmed by their entree (a burger, sausages, and a portabella burger). What I didn't like was that you had to order fries a la carte. I'm not really down with that. 

The drinks were okay. The waitress looked at me like I was from a different planet when I asked for a John Daly. They have a summer shandy that was pretty good. 

Handlebar is okay. I like the space and the concept more then I like that actual bar."}
{"text":"If you're on Mill and looking for the best selection of beer, you have to check out Handlebar. They've got the best staff in Arizona, and work hard to have a constantly refreshed menu of draft and bottled craft beers. If you've got a specific taste, it's likely that they'll find something you like from a local to a rare brew. 

There's a full bar and a menu of good bar snacks. Have to shout out to the fries with plenty of sauce options, the beer cheese, and the mini pretzel chicken pesto sandwiches that are amazing!

One of my favorite places in AZ, and a great place to hang on Mill!"}
{"text":"If you're going for a chill beer and food; then this is the place.  If you're in a bit of a rush, let the server know so they can help accordingly since they tend to let you be in peace which is nice most of the time.

The beer list is quite extensive and includes \"beer cocktails\" which is something I haven't run into much.  The shandy is very tasty; would be great to day drink to on a weekend.

Food is quality, a little expensive (hamburgers don't include fries).

Fun atmosphere.  We were there for trivia night which we weren't aware of but the questions seemed fun and unique to the establishment.

DOG FRIENDLY!  Patio has separate entrances and the server brought our pooch out a bowl of water first thing.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Handlebar is our usual place on Mill. The atmosphere is a little less ASU-y and more chill with a great patio with picnic tables. The bartenders have been there a while so that's a good sign.  Tasty beer and cider and snacks and we sometimes play jenga if we have a group of friends with us. The service is prompt and always fun to interact with the bartenders when there is a game on."}
{"text":"Met up with a bunch of friends at Handlebar for my friend's birthday meander on Mill for pre-dinner drinks. And to be honest, I was more than a little bummed when we left to head off to the next place.

The patio is great! A little warm in the summer (which is unsurprising, considering the Arizona heat), but the misters definitely made it feel like I wasn't standing on the sun. It's very open with a lot of seating and feels a lot more relaxed in comparison to some of the other patios on Mill.  And the waitress who was serving us was really nice and ridiculously attentive.

They have an amazing beer selection, which definitely made my night. They also offer some ridiculously tasty beer cocktails. I got a shandy, which was perfect, considering just how hot it was. My friend let me have a taste of her peach tandem and it was also ridiculously good. My only grouse, and it's a small one, is that the only cider they had (at the time, at least) was Crispin. That's not to say Crispin's a bad cider, because it isn't, I just wish they had more of a selection.

Despite the fact that we were heading off to dinner afterwards, we did end up ordering some pretzels and fries. Both of which were very good and I highly recommend. Especially with their beer cheese, which is fabulous.

TL;DR: Good food, good drinks, good service. Definitely have to pop in again before I move."}
{"text":"I think it's hilarious when I have a great time somewhere and feel inclined to write a review, then read other peoples reviews and see negative reviews that have more to do with their own faults than the establishments. People have this damn sense of entitlement and \"the customer is always right\" attitude that baffles me. Perhaps I'm biased as I'm in a service industry, but whatever. 

I have to say that my experiences at Handlebar have been great, so far. The bartenders are are friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable. We went there with a group of 10+ (some came and some went over the course of a few hours) and they were right on with the service, even with the water refills, which is important to me. I just like the place and enjoy riding my bike up there. Next time I'll get some names to give kudos too, but for now I have to say everyone I've been helped by there seemed very nice."}
{"text":"Would not accept a photo ID from a recognized US ally, member of NATO, and sovereign nation. Boarder line racism on their part."}
{"text":"This bar on mill is a great place to hang out - a fun atmosphere and it doesn't smell bad (which is a plus if you know Mill). For the most part the staff is nice, except this one girl who is just unfriendly. 

Anyhow, the food is just ok. I would never go there for the food, and it seems like with just a couple tweaks they could step it up. I usually get a cheeseburger - not enough cheese, bun is blah."}
{"text":"Just had their California Wrap BLT, really good !! Would have given them 5 stars but they ran out of chips ? And Caesar dressing ?? Erin !! Best  server ever !! She gets 10 stars. Helped me find a great selection after my 1st and 2nd selections were not available... Great outdoor patio and atmosphere !! Will definitely come back for the chips (with black pepper ranch dipping sauce) & ERIN"}
{"text":"I love to be seated at the bar in this place. They have a lot of games along with my favorite jenga. The cocktails are good. It gets very crowded and noisy post 7. The music is too loud. Food is also fine. A great bar for a drink or two though."}
{"text":"Handlebar has a fantastic patio and beer selection. I really enjoy that the patio is smoker friendly, it's incredibly nice to not have to leave the building for a cig every time. I'll say again, the beer selection is superb! The space definitely brings a much needed \"craft\" scene to Mill Ave. I've only had food here once a couple years ago. I think it was decent, not incredibly memorable (though that could be on account of the high abv's) 

Okay, so on to why the 2 stars. The service was absolutely horrendous! Incredibly so. My friend and I went in on a Saturday afternoon around 230 pm. The place had a lazy feel, from the staff to the handful of guests there. We were not greeted by anyone, not even a smile! Despite an almost empty bar, it took at least 10 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge our existence. When they did, not an ounce of happiness. I get it, it's Mill Ave and slow, probably not making the best money, but if you don't like it, don't work on Mill and take your terrible attitude somewhere else! The bartenders seemed to be really interested in washing glasses and staring at the floor. Maybe we were expecting too much by asking for suggestions on the house cocktails! *shrugs* overall, incredibly disappointing, slow, just simply well below average service. This place has ALL the potential to be a destination spot for Tempe, there's just something missing..."}
{"text":"These people have no clue how to run a decent bar. Not a chill spot with terrible music and somehow people still show up. Garbage service and weak drinks"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite bar on Mill Avenue. The bartenders are great (Jeff specifically, he's the man!) and the drinks are always perfect. They handle the busy weekends with ease and really make you feel comfortable being there. They always recommend a good beer to try (have TONS on tap, most of which I've never even heard of). Worth going there to start out if you're planning on drinking all night on Mill Avenue!"}
{"text":"First time visitors for lunch. Selected it for its history. Good food, attentive service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun here for my friend's bachelor party. The patio is really spacious and is a lot of fun. They also had this pomegranate cider on tap that was delicious! Seems like a pretty chill place to grab a cold one."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly! Very accomodating to large groups! Drinks were great and they kept them coming! Off hours are the best! If you're free on Saturday for a quick bite and and cold brew this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Handlebar is my favorite bar on Mill. They have a good relaxed atmosphere with great music. It's a nice switch up from the Scottsdale club influence that seems to be taking over other bars on mill. Handle has a great beer selection and their happy hour includes half off brews. If you're looking for some food I'm a big fan of their burger and fries (roasted garlic aioli on the side). I've had questionable service a couple times but it was nothing to stop me from coming back. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for drinks on mill."}
{"text":"I had a great time here as a post-conference social with about 30 friends and conference participants. We went straight to the very back outdoor area. There are plenty of tables back there, but there's also just a large space by the fire. It worked out perfectly for us, and we were able to just hang out, enjoy some drinks (great beer selection), and get groovy with it when the beat was right. (We may have turned our little corner into a dance club, even though Handlebar was very clearly not a dance club.) 

The drinks here seem to be pretty average priced. Didn't get a chance to eat anything here though -- but definitely want to come back for some food sometime!

Would definitely recommend Handlebar if you're looking to just casually hang out, grab a beer, or some food. It gets pretty loud inside with all of the TVs on when it's packed. Really big space though."}
{"text":"$2 beers? How can I say no?

This is a pretty great place for your afternoon happy hour. It's not uncommon for a few of my coworkers to head over here if we get out early on Fridays. The menu selection is pretty varied, and service is usually pretty fast.

The decor aspires to be a bit hipster-esque, but not suffocatingly so. Don't feel out of place if cardigans and tight jeans aren't your thing. I like it because it's a nice change of pace from some of the more dive-y places on Mill. The crowd is usually pretty mixed, so you'll find young professionals, older adults, and college students.

Great place for a meet up with a friend or group."}
{"text":"I went a few months ago for the first time and had an ok time on the outside patio. Food was great, service was kinda slow, but it was a Friday night and kinda slow on Mill.
I decided a few weeks after that to return and sit at the bar this time. It was a world of a difference in service! Brandon was awesome and made sure my friends and I were well taken care of throughout that night. Since then I have returned several times and sat in Brandon's station. Because of his phenomenal standards of service and the tasty food + bevs, I plan to continue to visit as well as recommend to friends in the area."}
{"text":"Not open when they say they're open.  Door clearly says 11 am.  Do not appreciate making a special trip to Mill Ave. for 11 am beer & lunch to discover they've decided to not open until 3pm for awhile because they're new.  Thanks for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Brats are amazing.  Great Beer Selection. Kaley was our server and she was really nice! My boyfriend got a burger that was supposed to be Medium Rare and it wasn't so she immediately fixed the problem. He got a brat instead and it was so good!!!! We also brought our dogs here! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite bar on Mill. Period.

But...before you run over there I need to ask you a couple questions: Do you actually like beer, and Are you a douchebag? I just don't want anyone spoiling my happy place. Please go to Firehouse or something...I beg of you.

Anyway - They have a perfectly planned, concise menu. Decide what you feel like and they will have the most fruity, dry, hoppy, chocolatey, malty (anything) draughts and/or bottles to fulfill your desires. White Chocolate Ale? Oh, they have it. A rare Belgian Framboise? Drink it up.

If you're hesitant about beer, but still not trainwrecky enough to hang out at the other Mill spots, you can get a \"beer cocktail\". Promise you can't go wrong here.

Lastly (but definitely not least)...there's the food - Comforting, simple, child-hood memory evoking, local deliciousness. 

The patio is perfect, the food is divine, and the beer is everything you'd want on your wishlist.

I post this with hesitation. Don't ruin my joint!"}
{"text":"This bar is unlike any other that I've been to on Mill.  Most bars on Mill either smell or make you feel too old if you're out of college.  This is a great laid back feel with a nice atmosphere to just hang and have a bite with a beer.  

They have a lot of good munchies on the menu along with a huge beer selection.  My favorite as far as food goes?  The pretzels with cheese! Mmmmm!  The beer menu is large, but not so large you feel overwhelmed like World of Beer down the street.  

They have a nice patio that I enjoyed drinking on many times in the spring. :)  But the inside isn't bad either, the bar area is pretty big and the tables in the back are cool if you're with a group.  Parking is to be desired.  I mean, it's on Mill so you can't really have high expectations as far as parking goes.  For that I do not fault them. :)

If you are near by and haven't tried this place I highly recommend it, especially if you aren't much on the Mill scene."}
{"text":"My three favorite things about handlebar (in order) are (1) it's the only bar and restaurant on Mill Ave that doesn't move all its tables to become a dance club on Fridays and Saturdays. Unfortunately, the music does get pretty loud, but it's still the best place for people who want to sit and drink on a Friday or Saturday near ASU and the only place on Mill to take your parents on those days, (2) the beer and food - both are fantastic all the time. I haven't had anything I didn't like there and (3) the sinks are outside of the bathrooms so you can wash your hands before you eat without having to wait in line to get into the bathroom or touch a bathroom door handle or anything horrible like that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more than 2 stars but couldn't bring myself to.

We work in the Tempe/Scottsdale area so we try new restaurants as often as possible for weekday lunches. Do not come here for lunch if you intend to leave before dinner.

We sat ourselves per the sign at the front and made sure we'd be seen. 10 minutes later we get a waitress. We ordered right away and though I wish there were more than 8 options we all like burgers and brats so there was something for everyone. Considering half these options were burgers I expected to be asked how I'd like it cooked but the waitress didn't bother.

The 2 burgers and a brat  took over 30 minutes to come out, which was way to long considering there were only a handful of other people there who already had food or were just drinking. 
The food was good but not good enough to make up for the wait. The fries clearly sat before making their way to the table. Now for the sauce for the fries, you get 1 free with a small fry and 2 with a large. More are $0.50 extra. The Thai ketchup was probably the highlight of the meal. It was spicy and went well with the sweet potato fries. 

After we ate we waited about 10 minutes before having to ask the waitress to bring us our check. We got the check and put a card in immediately but she walked off. 15 minutes later we had to track her down and hand it to her just so we could leave.

We didn't get any drinks so I can't offer any opinions on Happy Hour or the bar. I can't imagine the service gets better as they get busy though."}
{"text":"Hey, seriously folks? I have wanted to try this trendy little establishment for awhile now. I love the layout and the open air feeling and the hanging bike for sure. So last Sunday afternoon we stopped in and grabbed an outside table and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. My son even stepped up to the bar for service and the bartender told him he'd be back in a minute but that turned into five more. So we stood up to leave and our server appeared. She popped a few menus down and strode off, not to be seen for about 10 more minutes. I'm just getting started here! We ordered a beer or two, which they didn't have. We went down their list of beers and they were out of six - 6!! beers that we wanted to try. You're kidding, right? Nope. So we ultimately ordered something she said they had and she came back a few minutes later with another beer entirely. Yep, they were out of another beer. We ordered food, why oh why? Got our dried out pressed patties of beef (?) with literally no dressing whatsoever. The Classic Burger should have had a bacon bleu cheese dressing - it was absent just like the beer in this place. Score Card - Service, blech. Beer selection, blech. Food, blech. Handlebar - you had your chance and I'm never coming back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Went to the Handlebar for the first time for lunch today. I had my dog and I was very pleased with the fact that they had a dog friendly patio. We were told to seat ourselves on the patio and she said the server would be out in a few minutes. 20 minutes later I still haven't seen anyone even walk by or acknowledge the fact that I was there. The inside was not even remotely busy, so I am pretty upset at this point. Another 10 minutes later and I just left. I am disappointed because the food looked really good, but the service is terrible. I Would not recommend going here unless you have all day to wait."}
{"text":"As a local Tempe resident & dog owner we're all about supporting local businesses who are dog friendly. 

Pros: Walking distance from our house & the husband's office. Great beer selection. Dog friendly (they bring water filled bowls out for the pups). Big open patio areas and plenty of places for your dog to be comfy. Great fries & dipping sauces. 

Cons: Awful service. Awful food. The bar staff is the worst I've encountered. Major attitude & overall a lack of respect towards the customers that frequent this establishment. I'm shocked that nothing has been done to invest in a better team. We've hosted a birthday, brought numerous visitors, office happy hours and it's consistently the same. 

As bad as the food & service is, we continue to spend money here. We do love the fact that it's dog friendly and they don't limit the hours you can bring the dogs. The other patrons here are always friendly. The service on the patio has been much better than the service you receive on the inside. 

Hope to see things change in the future - it's such a great place & the layout cannot be beat. \"Management\", you really need to bring in a new crew who like to work, are friendly and have some social skills."}
{"text":"Is there a Zero Star?  

Awesome a BEER garden in downtown Tempe.  Sign me up.  We get the menu and they have a decent selection of good craft beers.  Awesome again.

There are 6 of us at the table this night (Saturday prior to this review) and out of the 6 beers we order, they are out of 4.  Ummm THUD.  Oh let me rephrase, they were out of 5, cause when they brought one of the beers they said they had they really didn't have it and changed his order to a Kiltlifter without asking.  THUD again.

How does a beer garden on a Saturday night not have beer?

Onto the food.  I love sausages and they have 4 of them on the menu, I think two or three burgers and a few salads.  Like 7 items total.  So a brat and beer sounded good.  Oh...were out of all sausage.  THUD.

Enough for me.

7 menu items, out of 4, beer garden out of at least 5 beers on tap (could have been more who knows) tells me all I need to know.

Buh bye."}
{"text":"I thought this place was super cute and fun. We were in and out pretty fast for a Pre Gammage meal and Yelp Elite Event. I had the burger and my friend had the fish and chips. Amazingly enough ( who knew) the fish is really delish! ( Like that rhyme? ) Very good for AZ. The chips were just regular French Fries not really chips and not that great. They might consider chip style fries. My burger was pretty good. The pretzels are wonderful. They rival, \"Culinary Dropout's The Yard\" and that is saying a lot. The service was fantastic! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"1/2lb burger and the chicken sandwich were really tasty. The beer choices are great too. Asked for chocolate desert and got three samples of chocolate, vanilla and choc shake what a surprise and education!  We will be back."}
{"text":"This bar is the shit. I get my drink on, smoke a cigar, and they even bring a specific cigar tray. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Barman was an idiot who spent all his time getting very excited about recounting his video game exploits to a couple of his mates.

Limited selection of drinks. Location was good as was the layout of the bar but lack of good drinks and IQ challenged staff let it down."}
