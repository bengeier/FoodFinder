{"text":"Finn McCool's is so fun, and the bar staff is so friendly! I absolutely loved my first experience, and I can't wait to go back. Cheap brews and great service make for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Finn McCools used to be one of my favorite places in southside, but then it all went terribly wrong for some reason.  I would have given this place 4/5 stars prior to the changes and 1/2 after them, so until i figure out if the changes are permanent i will give it 3  I used to love coming down her on a Friday or Saturday around 10 pm. Nice crowd of people not too crowded nor empty.  Great drink specials before midnight for beer and mixed drinks, Great atmosphere where you could meet new people or just hang out with your friends.  Loved coming down here and laughing at the people who would still get bud lights when a stella or guiness cost the same during their specials.  For whatever reason though this all changed the last two times times i was there.  They brought in a DJ, noise level went from like a 4/5 to a +10.  Literally you have to scream to be heard place is packed to the brim and the age demographic went from late 20s to 21(probably younger with fake IDs).  This was set up like a cigar bar with nice leather seating towards the back and it was really nice... now it just feels like its trying to be Diesel.  Unfortunately for me this is a big turn off and no longer make this a place to start or end the night in Southside."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few beers on a week night! Good specials, great friendly staff. Nice place to have a few & relax!"}
{"text":"The green beer, they say, is Yuengling, but it tastes like Milwaukee's best with food coloring. Don't drink the green beer here on St Pats."}
{"text":"Well -- the Steelers obviously couldn't manage the Super Bowl victory.  Maybe it was the late nights at places like Finn McCools or maybe they just got beat.  Regardless -- Finns is still a good bet."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Great prices on drinks.  It is also in the heart of the south side so location is convenient for a night out."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night, the bouncer wasn't at all pleasant, but the service was as too be expected on a busy Friday night.  The prices were okay and atmoshpere was pleasant.  We only stayed for a drink because we were looking for somewhere to dance."}
{"text":"An Irish bar in the Southside of Pittsburgh.  A treasure complete with Irish quotations.  \"Life is too short to read a bad book.\" James Joyce.  \"The worst thing about some men is that when they aren't drunk they are sober.\" W. B. Yeats"}
{"text":"I like this place it has a great atmosphere but the bartenders on Saturdays are rude and seem to be very disgruntled while working with the people. It is southside there will be drunk people but don't be rude to the people who tip you. Server etiquette please."}
{"text":"Gotta getta bomb.  Front windows make ideal place For public pantsing."}
{"text":"The bartender working on April 3, 2018 was literally the rudest person I've ever met. We went in there (it was pretty empty) and were waiting for our friends at the bar area so we could start drinking together. The bartender approached us and threatened that she would kick us out unless we ordered a drink. This was our initial interaction with her, not something along the lines of, \"what can I get you guys\". Not wanting to respond to her negativity, my friend was like,  \"hmm sure I'll get a cranberry vodka,\" which was $3.50 I believe. As he took $3 out of his wallet, she literally says, \"YOU BETTER HAVE THAT F*CKING 50 cents\". She was extremely rude and despite everything my friend still tried talking to her before we left as that is not the way to speak to a customer. Her only response was, \"So what, I don't f*cking care\".  Honestly, the bar seem pretty nice but after that interaction, none of us would go in there ever again. I highly suggest avoiding this bar. I hope the manager sees this and her attitude towards customers is addressed."}
{"text":"I had okay service and an overall okay experience. They do not really have anything to remember them by. I might go back someday."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Awful drinks and awful management. Absolutely would not recommend this bar. It truly is an absolute disgrace to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Finn McCools is a very busy club on the weekends right in the middle of Carson Street. It has bouncers on the weekend and there is often times a line. On the inside the bar gets very busy and it sometimes takes a while to get a drink."}
