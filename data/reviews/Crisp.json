{"text":"Perfect for Sunday lunch. They served our family of 8 adults with ease.  Orders were perfect and served quickly.  Food was excellent, fresh, and very tasty!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and the service is great! I used to go to the 7th street location but will drive an extra couple minutes to go to this one strictly because of the staff. One of the employees, Brian, remembered mine and my boyfriends name which I thought was so cool. He always goes above and beyond and is so pleasant every single time. The food is also amazing! If you haven't went to crisp yet definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"great salad, neven knew there were so many ways to get a salad."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I want a quick, fresh, customizable salad.  My favorite salad is all of the makings of the 'crisp pork tenderloin' but with grilled tofu instead of pork (though it is also delicious with the pork).  It is awesome to see all of the fresh, high quality ingredients right before your very eyes and be able to select exactly what you want in your salad. The price for what you get is also fair.  The staff is always exceptionally nice and pleasant.

Perhaps my one disappointment with Crisp was once when my grilled tofu was more along the lines of burned than grilled.  My salad was to go so I didn't have the opportunity to notify the staff.  Aside from this one burned-tofu incident, the food is very consistent.

Added bonus, free Wi-Fi in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location, has outdoor seating and the food is visually appealing. The prices are a bit on the high side, but still not outrageous. A good place to sit outside, and eat healthy, fresh, but sometimes bland-ish food."}
{"text":"It's been up and down here! Some days the soup is perfect some days not so much...the salads are average and were walking distance from our house as well so it's convenient."}
{"text":"Today when trying to order from the 7th street location, I called at 11:35 AM a total of 6 times...and two of these times I allowed the phone to ring for 5+ minutes. I was very curious as to what today's soup selection was so that I could place an order. Needless to say, my phone call was never answered."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have have been here twice and can't get enough of it.  Not really a fan of eating healthy, I begrudgingly came to Crisp per my girlfriend's suggestion.  ( I wanted BBQ, hushpuppies, and onion rings and she just knew better)  First when you walk in you feel that you are making a good decision by eating here.  The place is decked out in every shade of green imaginable, a very cool color scheme IMHO.  The staff is SO welcoming, they are happy to have you there & they point you in the right direction on how to start the process. I ended up ordering the BBQ Chicken salad and it was legendary.  They have all sorts of combinations as well as a make your own salad option.  The salad bowls are HUGE, so they satisfy even the most voracious appetite that walks through the door.  Make sure to try Crisp when you want something a little different and a step in the healthy direction."}
{"text":"Delicious options - I had the roasted cauliflower soup and a BBQ Chicken salad on my last trip, and I've been tasting that soup ever since! (Um, in a good way, not in a \"oh great googly moogly, make it stop\" kinda way. In the \"I want to make that be in my mouth more\" way.)

I would really love to see more comprehensive options for vegans beyond tofu - tabbouleh, quinoa, hummus, seiten, and so on would really just make this POP."}
{"text":"Crisp is one of my favorite restaurants in the area!! The very friendly staff makes me feel welcome every time I pop in for a quick bite to eat. They have even made me an off day special on request. I recommend Crisp for anyone looking for a great place for lunch or to go order. The line can get quite long during the lunch hours but it's so worth it!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Presentation needs work. Don't order the shrimp salads you will be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Crisp is a lovely unique little sandwich and salad shop. One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. I go here when I'm in the mood for a fresh tasty salad. They make your salad the way you want it right in front of you! Crisp is perfect if you want a healthy and fast alternative to a drive through. The food is always wonderful and the staff is friendly and helpful. Try it!"}
{"text":"While the food is great and tastes fresh, the process and service is seriously flawed. 
Had to wait 10 minutes to get my salad that was made when I ordered it. 
The person I was with got the wrong salad with their sandwich which was also made when ordered. 
Service staff are friendly, but not engaging and lacking personality (or at least not showing any personality). 
Worth the food, but be prepared for a convaluted process and wait time."}
{"text":"Wow, Crisp rocks the salad house! My sister, another friend and I went to Crisp during lunch peak hour and it was packed. It was my first time but was happily surprised by how easy the menu was to read and navigate. Sometimes I go into some of these create your own kind of places and get lost in the options and confused as to what to order. Have to say that Crisp large menu signs and really nice people behind the counter made it easy and hassle-free. 

I ordered the FCN (Fruits, Cheese and Nuts) salad but grilled tofu and the salad was am-a-zing. It was the perfect blend of delicious apples, tart cranberries, bleu cheese, walnuts and a simple vinaigrette. The only negative comment was the tofu was not that good. It was too char-grilled tasting and needed some additional flavor to it. Next time, I go back I'll order the same salad minus the tofu."}
{"text":"CRISP has become my healthy go to lunch spot. The ingredients are always fresh and due to such generous portions I always have enough for left overs (a great way to stretch my $10 lunch). I recently started to get the BLT (love the aoli) and even then the salad portions are extremely generous and you have the opportunity to customize your side salad. My only slight is that with the model you sometimes get a taste of cross mixing of ingredients. Normally it's not a big deal but sometimes I can get a minor blue cheese flavor and I really dislike blue cheese.. Not enough to make me not come back. 

Update: I have since been back to this location several times for the BLT wrap. The bacon is never fresh,cold, and is very chewy. They are also frequently out of ingredients such as avocado. Now the reason I provided an update because I have been to the uptown location multiple times  and the quality of the same sandwich and ingredients are ALWAY far superior to this location and for that reason I will be docking a star from them."}
{"text":"We've lived here three weeks and have eaten here four times. The salads are fresh and inventive. My personal fav is the salmon with pesto. The soups and chili are also excellent. The service is friendly and pretty quick considering they're cooking the protein to order. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to grab a healthy lunch.  Haven't tried it for dinner, but would assume that they serve alcohol in the evenings.  Turkey Gobbler sandwich is delicious.  Already planning a trip back for next week!"}
{"text":"I came here while travelling. This is a full-service salad bar with a sit-down restaurant section. You go up to order your salad and pay, and then a server can come around and get you things you might need (therefore, you should tip at the counter when you pay for your food!). 

The staff were extremely pleasant, accommodating, and quick. I ordered a steak caesar salad. The reason I gave it 4 stars, though, was because I really wasn't that impressed with the salad. The steak was overcooked and charred, and the salad overall really just didn't taste like anything special. 

Also, just as a side not: I seriously got some bang for my buck. The portion size was f'ing huge!!!"}
{"text":"I like that I can create my own salad so I can enjoy all the ingredients when I have my salad. Especially like the fact they grill your chicken fresh, and the chicken is hot when it's served."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Crisp, which is a go-to healthy spot for me.  Everything is always fresh and dependable.  Still my favorite salad joint in town."}
{"text":"This placed used to be 5 stars the last time I visited; granted that was almost 3 years ago (my job relocated closer to the East Blvd location). 

Unfortunately I introduced THIS location to my fianc√©. He ordered a Caesar salad with chargrilled chicken; the chicken tasted microwaved and probably was because it took virtually no time to come out before mine did. The \"charred\" was more like Burnt. oh and it had bits still pink/un\"cooked\". I ordered a custom salad with shrimp... the shrimp had a thick teriyaki glaze. Maybe it's been longer than I thought since visiting a Crisp but a heavy glaze on grilled shrimp just doesn't make sense to me for a fresh salad. 

The customer service was nothing special, no one was personable but they sure were with each other. The space itself has not been kept up with as there were dust strings from the hanging fixtures and many rubber streaks/dirt on the floor. The salad chefs were constantly slamming the bowls after finishing a salad. We couldn't stand being there and will never be back at this location. I can't help but think Crisp has franchised and this stores owner does not care it."}
{"text":"They know me by name and order. This is sad and simultaneously awesome. When i worked in New York, I loved being able to go to a corner deli and get a healthy salad, fast. When I discovered Crisp, I was stoked to find a similar concept. 

They have signature salads and a good variety of things to build your own salad with. Their margherita pizza is great and I have enjoyed some of their soups as well. 

My only suggestion would be that they try to add some seasonal vegetables to add to salads and pizzas throughout the year."}
{"text":"i went for lunch and it was wonderful. We went early around 1130 and beat the crowd. It was a great day to go it was about 70 so a good day to sit outside. The food was delicious I got a turkey sandwich with pasta salad and I just loved it! It was freshly made and they brought it right to our table. Yum!"}
{"text":"I would love to have a good to-go salad place that is reliable.  But, Crisp is only so-so.  I'm not sure why, but the salads have very little flavor.   They don't season their chicken or salmon...so everything needs salt and pepper; but, even the veggies seem bland and the dressing doesn't kick it up at all.  I was highly irritated when my last to-go order had grilled tofu (Ugh!) instead of salmon.  Also, the tofu was grilled too long, so the only flavor it had was burnt."}
{"text":"Amazing salads, however inconsistent ingredients. The canned portobello mushrooms are a disgrace to such a good product. I have also ordered mandarin oranges before that were spoiled."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my experience here , location is ideal , scenery and parking close by. Food was excellent, healthy and fresh ingredients, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I had the chophouse sandwich with pasta salad with iced tea all was delicious including the iced tea."}
{"text":"Since this place used to be a favorite of mine,  I decided to go back and give the salad another try.  The salmon was much fresher this time.  I will go back in another week or so and update again if needed"}
{"text":"Love.  Huge portion.  Create your own or go with their suggestions.  BBQ chicken is my current fave.  A little on the steep side financially, but you may be able to make it into 2 meals.  

The layout of the restaurant is not conducive to take out orders.  You wait in line with others, regardless of dining in or taking out, place your order, pay at the register, but then there's nowhere to sit/stand to wait for your order.  You are either standing in top of staff blocking their path to and from the kitchen, standing in front of the tea/lemonade stand, or forcing diners to stare at your butt/junk while you stand right next to their tables waiting for your food.  I'm not sure what the answer is besides removing an interior table, but we all know that's not going to fly.

I'm not sure the toasted baguette slice adds any value.  Bland.  I like it conceptually, but they can do better."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, a place you can truly go to alone eat and not feel like a loser. The service is good but nothing to rave about... The food is not great... They ask you how you want your steak prepared, I ask for it medium and always end up with it well done... I still come here on a semi regular basis because it's good I just wish the passion was here to make it great."}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch today at Crisp. I had the Salmon Salad and added egg, substituting spring mix for spinach. The staff was mostly helpful; however 2 things bothered me. 1) no nutritionally information was available which was surprising considering their healthy nature of their menu. 2) the eggs were not at all correctly cooked and I'm shocked they were served the way they were. They were grossly over cooked and a very gray...I would suggest figuring out a better method of boiling those. 

Otherwise my salmon was fantastic and the portion was large. Worth the money, I'd just expect a few changes before I came back."}
{"text":"We stopped into Crisp because it looked good and we liked the idea of a good salad place.  
This was one of, if not the worst customer experiences I have ever had.  I ordered a salad that had grilled chicken on it, and my fiancee ordered a soup and a salad.  They brought her soup and salad together and told me my salad was coming.  15 minutes later I asked where it was and they said that they were just getting grilled chicken onto the grill.  Not to mention in a not exactly friendly manner.  I asked again several minutes later and they said it'd be out.  
Finally about a half hour after ordering, and after about 8-10 other people got their salads I was finally served.  
The food was ok, but nothing special.  I don't feel the desire to go back again.  There are too many other places to try."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today. My salad was made fresh to order but I felt it was way overpriced ($12 for a salad & a bottle of water). It was noisy inside and the AC was not the best! Overall my experience was ok but I am in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This is the last time I'll ever go to Crisp. Every time I've been to Crisp, the meat on my salads are too \"crisp\", in the form of BURNT. Those black grill marks are carcinogenic. For a place that appears to be healthy, they need to be more concious of burnt meat, which has been known to cause Cancer. This last Steak salad I ordered was charred to the point of me having to throw it all away. A $10 salad in the garbage. Never again, will i eat your burnt meat Crisp!!!"}
{"text":"Crisp is pretty awesome. If you are confused as to what they do- it's like panera but not shitty. 

Customer service was awesome and the atmosphere is pretty cool. I think my meal was like 9 bucks and by far the best wrap I've ever had. I got a side salad as well and it was amazing. 

I am used to paying 12 or so bucks for the same meal and service and getting half the quality. So needless to say I am pretty impressed. Impressed enough to yelp about it which is rare.."}
{"text":"I'm new to Charlotte and I am glad this place is a few blocks down my street. 

The Flank Steak sandwich with side salad was really good. I would definitely come back to try the salads (they look tasty)"}
{"text":"I have not been to crisp in a while and was CRAVING a fresh delicious salad for dinner. When I arrived, I noticed their sanitation score was 86! How is that possible?! I was highly disappointed, and extremely disgusted. I turned around and left quickly."}
{"text":"Lots of great options for your salad.. The shrimp protein option is incredible and so flavorful. Prices aren't cheap, but for $10 I get a huuuuge (seriously, enormous) salad with 5 toppings and shrimp which I think is reasonable for the quality of food that you get. Definitely worth the money. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh, room is pleasant, and the staff really hustle...all except the cashier, who is nice enough but sooooooo slow and can't keep up. She causes a bottleneck, which means customers must stand and wait to pay with their food in hand -- longer than they waited to GET the food. Hey, if they can figure it out at Salsarita's they oughta figure it out at Crisp."}
{"text":"I'm updating an old review because  I've been to Crisp a dozen times in the last couple months (we live 20 miles away) and I can't get enough. I've customized my salad a couple times which was great., but I stumbled upon their Salmon Salad with Pesto and have been IMPRESSED.  It's delicious.  They cook the meat to order so you get a fresh salad with excellent ingredients topped with salmon and pesto that just came off the grill."}
{"text":"Delicious! My go-to for a healthy lunch since I work nearby. I've tried a sandwich and it was good, but I usually get a salad since they're so tasty. It really is fresh too. They put together your salad ingredients and grill your protein as you order. No pre-made salads here."}
{"text":"I love this new location of Crisp.  Easy in-and-out for take-out, or pop in for lunch.  I've been two times in the past couple weeks, and each time, the service is fast and efficient, and the order is perfectly right. 

I won't bore you with the details, because this one is almost the same as the 7th street location...but I will say this for anybody who hasn't been before: 

Fresh ingredients (several types of salad greens to choose from and lots of toppings), big portions (never, never do I finish a whole salad, maybe 3/4ths at best) and yes, a bit more expensive than a salad you'd get at the salad bar.  The grilled shrimp custom salad I buy is usually $12 with unsweetened iced tea...but I don't mind paying the price for the selection and freshness.  I always get an extra crisp bread to go with my salad for crunch. 

Oh, and I totally agree with Stephanie K.  It's my go-to place for detoxing after a 12 course heavy meal :-) It just makes your body feel better :-)"}
{"text":"After a weekend of eating at at an Indian buffet, a sushi buffet, grilling out with friends and eating 2 Dairy Queen Blizzards, it was time to detox the bod with something fresh and yummy.  Crisp it is!
  
The salads come in ginormous bowls-- and are more than enough, even for the hon-griest eaters. Love that you can mix and match your lettuce leaves.  (Love me some spring mix and spinach.)

My current fave, the make-your-own with grilled shrimp (nice smoky grilled flava) feta, chickpeas, mandarin oranges, honey walnuts, apple-cider vinaigrette.  Two parmesan crisps please! 

Everything is super fresh and there's never that disgusting lettuce-leaf-slime. The service is fast and friendly too-- even when things get really packed for lunch or dinner.  

My friend got a sandwich with beef, and he thought the beef was a bit chewy.  

TIP: 1/2 priced wine on Mondays! 

Overall, great value for the money-- fresh and yummy. Sure beats the Dean and Deluca salad bar (which is extensive and good, yes, but doesn't feature freshly grilled proteins) any day!"}
{"text":"I love the quality and taste of the food! I also love this healthy alternative for when I am in need of a healthy quick meal. The price is good and I am amazed the salad makers know all the ingredients by heart. The service is great and by that I mean their knowlege, efficiency, and overall kindness. I think most of the staff is working really hard and pay attention to the details. This has to be hard with the many variations on orders and heavy crowds. I am only giving 4 stars because twice now they have messed up my order and thank goodness it was mine and not someone allergic to shrimp when I asked for chicken. That is just dangerous and quite frustrating. I even asked them to check the order because the girl putting them all together was clearly lost and everyone had to wait quite a while for her to sort it out - not the first time. That is likely the only part of this otherwise efficient process that is broken because there are typically several boxed salads waiting while the cashier takes more orders and the \"box up\" girl is off cleaning tables."}
{"text":"I stop in here about once a week for a salad for lunch. I almost always get the FCN (Fruit, cheese, nut). I stop here so often because the salads are always fresh, the service is always friendly and quick, and I don't have to wait. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"UPDATE  even know id still give it a 3.5 upon eating around town a bit more, and coming back to Crisp, I have to say it's on the higher end of 3.5 than the lower end. . 


Id probably give Crisp a 3.5 if .5's were allowed.  Crisp was good not great not bad consistent.  Ill go back for sure but it is what it is a salad place.    I guess im struggling cause i feel a 3 star is low, but a 4 i think is too high.  It is just really what it is an honest salad place.  It probably surpassed my expectations.  I know i will be back, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh quick bite to eat. It's clean, you get real silverware and real salt and pepper shakers all plusses in my book.  It was a little chilly, but what ever thats as much the weather."}
{"text":"Went here with some fellow yogis as we wanted a healthy lunch and this is right up my alley!  They have a wide variety of salads on their menu and they have a make your own salad option with lots of fresh ingredients and it's reasonable price-wise.  The salads are enormous too.  They have sandwiches which looked good as well.  Small space, but there was plenty of room for the 6 of us on a Sun at noon.  Went to the Dilworth location.  Friendly service as well. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"The salad I ordered here was overpriced and lacked flavor. Won't go back as there are better places for salads close by."}
{"text":"I love coming to crisp. Salads are awesome but they have to do something about their chicken. I have been here consistently for a year and every time the chicken is incredibly dry. Do yourself a favor, go to crisp and get the salmon or tofu. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to my fair share of build-your-own-salad joints and this one is top notch. With salads, the little things can make or break them and, between the super-fresh ingredients and grilled-to-order toppings, Crisp really delivers. My favorite salads are the F.N.C. (fruit, nut, cheese) and steakhouse salads, but the specials are always good, as are the infinite combinations you can think of.

And not feeling so green? The sandwiches are pretty darn good, too. And they come with a side salad or a delicious pasta salad."}
{"text":"Used to be way better!!!  I got the BLT and there was one tiny tomato on each half and big globs of fatty bacon on each.  It used to be nice strips of bacon but this was all clumped together like it was scooped with an ice cream scooper.  And not to mention it was more fat than bacon.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just returned to the office after a HORRIBLE lunch at Crisp.  Let me tell you....

I stood in line forever waiting to order.  Finally got my order in and sat down.  Waited at least 15 minutes, still no food.  Asked a server to please check on my order and she said that the kitchen was behind on sandwiches.  Well, anyone who has ever been to Crisp knows that you can see the kitchen from the dining area.  I could see a guy leaning up against a counter with his arms crossed.  I asked the server to at least bring my salad out first, and she responded that the salad and sandwich are plated together (so essentially, no).  She left and came back about 5 minutes later with the wrong food!  Not only was it not my order, the food she brought me had been through the wringer...the bread was all wet and soggy (and  GROSS).  Seriously, why would the server even bother to bring something like that out to a customer.  She should have had someone in the kitchen make a fresh sandwich.  Anyway, I proceed to bring the wrong food back to the girl at the register and tell her that I'd like my money back.  She looked at the food, and then proceeded to look for my order.  She comes back with a to go box that had apparently been sitting there for a while and asked me if that was mine.  It looked like the sandwich I ordered, but they put the wrong side salad with it....AND it had been sitting there for a while, so didn't look so hot.  The cashier said that I could have the food anyway, and she'd still give me my money back.  I politely declined.  After I got my  money back I went next door to Fresh Market and got a sandwich.  Had to eat it in my car on the way back to my office, since I had already taken over an hour for my lunch.  Total disaster.  What happened to this place?  It used to be good."}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy and fairly quick. Love the variety offered for the salads and the chophouse sandwich was simple and well prepared."}
{"text":"The salad was average but the salmon was awful! It was over priced for what you get and how you get it (cafeteria style)"}
{"text":"Good salads. Close to home. Guy who takes the order and makes the salad is a massive jerk. Every time.  Everyone else is pleasant. Will come back as the product is great and no good alternative. But hate hate hate dealing with that guy."}
{"text":"This place is usually great.  However, I was grossed out when the chef was eating and cooking the protein at the same time.  No gloves and yes he was using his hands to pick up his food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried it for the first time yesterday as we were looking for a place to have a good salad. This place was wonderful and met my expectations. Great choices of salads, wraps, and pizza. They even let you customize your salad if you want. They make your protein of choice on demand which was great because it was fresh. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed the hours online say Crisp is open until 9. This is the 3rd time I have tried to come on a Sunday and Crisp has been closed. Today I was there at 4:45, to find a closed Crisp. Update your website so people don't drive across town to find a closed restaurant."}
{"text":"First visit!  Comes highly recommended!  The flavors, service and other amenities will guide the review!  Could hardly wait to try Crisp!!!  OK....first visit was very good.  So good that I went back the next day for second visit.  Greens were very fresh!  Presentation of all the veggie toppings was awesome!  My salmon on my grilled salmon salad was much smaller and thinner than expected.  it was kinda difficult to taste.  second visit had a salad without protein.  Had the chicken pesto pizza!  very good....and the \"beverage\" was nice and cold. The house red wine was great!   Looking forward to regular visits! Also...service and parking was good!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Very healthy salads.  The sandwich and salad combos are great!  The best thing to have before a movie or concert....if you are looking for a great hand made special pizza....try the Chicken Pesto!!! Awesome.  Service is always magnificent!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you have a salad craving.  I really like that you can personalize your salad to your liking.  I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Crisp is pretty awesome! Their portions are enormous, veggies are fresh, and the asian dressing is to die for!!!
I typically get a make your own salad and occasionally venture out for a sandwich. Once a co-worker got a sandwich which looked delicious and apparently I didn't remember the name right so when I went to get the same sandwich I didn't see it on the menu. I told the guy what it had on it and he whipped it right up. Obviously, it was pretty amazing.

They are friendly, service is quick and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This's restaurant specializes in salads and you can chose from their array of ready designed salads or build your own. Simple, delicious and quick with ample portions. I would have given it another star, but I entered from the parking lot in back and the sights and smells of the back hallway with open doors to the storage rooms and scullery were unappetizing & kind of garbage smelling. Those doors should really be closed. Once you get past that to the dining room it looks & smells fine. I would eat here again"}
{"text":"I came with high expectations to this place of of a recommendation and was really not impressed. I came in after the dinner rush to place a take out order. The staff was pretty friendly but they didn't seem all that excited to be at their job. As for the location, there is both indoor and outdoor  seating which is nice. 

I got two veggie sandwiches to go for my vegan sister and I. As a vegan in-training, I made sure to ask for dressing on the side and no cheese and came home to find both on the side salads. I also found a hair in my salad which was a bit unappetizing. The sandwich itself was alright... a little soggy but pretty tasty. 

I think I will come back and give it another try if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Crisp on and off for a few years and have always been impressed with the quality of meals.  Recently I venture away from the salad menu and started with the wraps.  Very very good.  It's not what I would consider cheap but you do get filled up and sometimes leftovers on the wraps.
The location is cool - they have inside and outside seating.  The service is fast and friendly - you place order - pay and then they bring directly to your table.  The wraps take longer than salads.
Only complaints - parking can be an issue and the noise level of the salad bar work is excessive in my opinion.  They constantly beat the pans and yell orders to back - I get it ... But it's not relaxing.  
That being said I give the food 5 stars.
The ambiance 3
Service a 5 
Which is around a 4 plus.
It's good food."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming for me and my salad snob family. We ventured off to this place initially to have salad and pizza however to our dismay they only serve pizza in the evening and we were there for lunch. 
The salad process was pretty unorganized as we ordered and the staff was not very enthused about working this day. I ordered salmon as my protein and it was called back into the kitchen and my husband orders chicken as his protein. We found a seat at a table near the door and with the nice weather the door was open and there were flys just a roaming which is out of the control of the restaurant so I can't fault them. It was a swatting interesting time (could've sat outside).
Back to the food, my husband salad came out let's say 1:05pm ish and I sat and watched him eat and talked with him as he offered up lettuce to me since I don't eat chicken before he ventured over to the counter to inquire about my salad this inquiry happened at about 1:20pm-ish and they basically forgot about my order which was on the same ticket and as my let use got all soggy waiting on the protein to be added to them THEY still decided to quickly make the salmon and add it to the soggy lettuce which wasn't going to fly with me so they had to remake my salad including the undercooked protein. 
My husband said his salad as So So and after my fiasco my salad was Ok because I was sooo hungry it was Ok but I'm sure I'll stick to Chopt as their salads are AMAZING and fresh and fast.

If ever in the area and in the mood for a salad I'll give them another go round and update my review accordingly as everyone deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Excellent salmon salad--I made my own with romaine, walnuts, feta and cranberries. Nice selection of beer & wine."}
{"text":"The salad was delicious as I made my own with grilled salmon, dried cherries, walnuts, almonds, portabella mushrooms and romaine lettuce.  I like the outside tables and the beer choices. It's a casual place and would be good for families where you can order sandwiches, pizzas or salads."}
{"text":"A very nice place.  It's comfortable yet classy which is a combo that I really liked.  The salads are their claim to fame and they have really earned their reputation.  They are made with really fresh ingredients and the dressings are a very good compliment to them.  They also offer other grill type items, I haven't tried them yet but they certainly smelled good.  The service was actually pretty quick which you don't really expect from upscale type place.  Overall it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I mean, it is a salad place ... can't go extremely wrong there. 
The salad was fresh and crisp...;)
Good dark green what i like to see,  the atmosphere was somewhat inviting and the guys and gals whipping the meals up were friendly. I ordered a steak/ blue cheese salad. (Can't remember if there was a special name) but for what it cost - wasn't tasty enough. I mean i can make it tastier at home for less. Just the impression that was left on me, but don't get me wrong i would definitely go back to try another crisp salad!"}
{"text":"The apple cider vinagerette dressing is my absolute favorite! My only complaint is it's a little pricey. But when you factor in the convenience of it being close to home and the taste, still gets 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I arrived around 11:15am, and left just before the lunch time rush at 11:45am. I was greeted by a white board with the  specials of the day. I chose the Mahi mahi wrap with the cucumber tomato salsa on the side. On the specials board, it was denoted that wait time may be a little longer for seafood specials so I waited patiently in the dining area while my food was prepared. After about 15 minutes, my food was ready. I went outside to enjoy my lunch on the outside patio. I opened my box and saw a neatly wrapped sandwich and a colorful salad. I was disappointed to see that the salsa was on the sandwich and not on the side as I had originally ordered. I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised! The cucumber salsa on my mahi mahi wrap complimented the fish perfectly. The meal was light but satisfying. I definitely think Crisp will be one of my go-to restaurants for a healthy and quick meal."}
{"text":"My salad was good, but the sanitation wasn't up to par. We entered from the back parking lot and the smells and sights were disgusting. Everything just seemed a little dirty."}
{"text":"Crisp is out to get me. I'm going to be voted off Yelp for this one. I don't understand- everyone loves Crisp, including hubby, yet maybe the staff at Crisp has my picture in the back and when I come in they purposely screw up my order.  

I love the concept as well- we need more of these. I like their salad menu (in theory) and the fact you can make your own with some good ingredients. My comment about that is that they should do seasonal ingredients and take it off the menu if it sucks  (e.g. tasteless hard pears). The sandwiches are much better in print than in the mouth, unfortunately.

What's my main complaint? To me, everything tastes the same: char. charred Tuna, charred chicken, charred steak, charred salmon. Blech. I'll have my salad sans carcinogens, s'il vous plait. As a result I think they compensate by over dressing the salads. So if I'm meeting someone there, I guess I could get salad without and charred protein. 

The new one in Dilworth is unfortunately the same, even though hubby had told me that he went and surprisingly the chicken was cooked perfectly (hence my conspiracy theory). I give up."}
{"text":"I picked up a salad here while I was visiting a friend in the area and I was very impressed! I love a good salad with fish on top. I'm used to most quick places (like Panera) using pre-cooked, cold salmon. It was a very nice surprise that they grill the salmon to order. I wasn't expecting to wait for fish but it was more than worth it!

I took my salad to go but I couldn't help but notice they had beer and wine and, of course, a patio!"}
{"text":"We got take-out sandwiches there early this evening; I got the grilled veggie and my husband got the turkey gobbler ($8.75/each), and they came with a bag of chips (there were many choices and we chose the sweet potato chips).  Truthfully, the sandwiches were disappointing; they tasted bland and they weren't very filling.  However, the chips were delicious and there were a generous amount in each bag.  The main reason why I'm giving four stars (instead of three) - other than the delicious chips - is because all of the people working there were *very* friendly."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I have frequented this place for the last several years. The quality and quantity has decreased since Chopped opened. In today's order I was without salad dressing and my boss's salad had brown edged romaine lettuce. Their salads used to be so impressively big, you couldn't finish it all. Now you can see the cardboard at the bottom of the container. Feels light for the price tag. I think my FCN literally had 2 slices of apple in it. When competition moves in you need to step up your game, not back off, in order to keep your customers. Unfortunately, we'll be frequenting the competition and not Crisp much in the future."}
{"text":"My first trip to Crisp and I got the pesto shrimp wrap with side salad for lunch. The prep was quick - I waited for 5min top after I sat down. The price was reasonable considering the large portion - $10 in total. And it might be the best wrap I've had in Charlotte... The ingredients were fresh and well cooked, a little bit heavy on oil but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I wish there were more healthy places like this near me in Uptown. I am a huge fan of awesome salads and Crisp is definitely that. I tend to lean towards their daily specials or stick with one of my favorites: blue cheese, nuts, fruit and vinaigrette salad. Yummo. 

Crisp offers many different salads and sandwiches on the menu OR you can customize your own with their buffet style of options that will be made right in front of you. The options can be as healthy as you would like and the price point isn't terrible. I imagine the typical meal would be about $10. It's a great place to grab an easy meal after a workout or on a super hot day when you just can't eat the fatty stuff. There is not waiter service here.. you order from the salad crafter and pay a cashier. There are quite a few tables inside as well as nice patio seating outside on nicer days. You could probably eat here everyday and never eat the same thing twice!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Crisp for their create-your-own salads, light menu and quick & friendly service. This is definitely the place to go for a tasty and healthy lunch if you're in the Dilworth area. Crisp is like a cafe in which you order your food from the counter at the back of the store and then have your food brought to you. I've only been to this location twice but I will say that the last time that I went the lady who cashed me out at the register was the friendliest person I have been helped by in a very long time. I did not catch her name but she definitely made my day a bit brighter. :)"}
{"text":"Great 'healthier' choice... character of a local place without the 'franchise' feel. Have been a couple of times and always get the salad with flank. Good stuff. The patio is perfect for a nice day. It's not cheap."}
{"text":"Love the concept of fresh, make your own salads. And the homemade dressings here are superb. Let me explain. I made my own salad over a bed of lettuce and chose salmon for my protein. The salmon was cooked fairly well, and then you can choose 3 toppings As well. You will thank me later if you order the roasted lemon vinaigrette dressing. It is seriously one of the best dressings I've ever had and I'm confident it would taste great with literally anything. I had to save the rest of what I had for another meal- nothing goes to waste! I remember having a pomegranate or berry side dressing as well, not sure if that was seasonal. I got this to to and devoured it in 2.5 seconds, hence no photo. As a dietitian, I love these quick, healthy fast food options and crisp is a great choice to have in charlotte- better yet, the trendy Elizabeth area!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, quick wait, and amazing product. Stopped in for lunch on a Friday, before the business. I've been to the one on 7th street but this was my first time for the Dilworth one. Two of the employees took time to start small chat, and offered smiles and friendly customer service. I had the salmon salad, but switched out tomatoes for artichokes, which was no problem at all. I had the lemon vinagrette dressing, which is so good! It goes perfectly as a light accompaniment to the salmon. Speaking of, the salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I was very happy with everything about this salad"}
{"text":"I have been back three times in two weeks. The service is excellent! More than I would expect for a salad place. The portions are large you can't even believe how much you get for the price.

I've gotten the salads, soups and wraps and they are beyond my expectation. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Crisp is pretty solid when you're craving a salad. They have tons of variety to choose from and ingredients to appeal to anyone. I enjoy adding crumbled blue cheese and their roasted red peppers along with steak and spinach to my salad. It is made to order so the steak takes time to cook. It's not sitting there in a container. 

If you go for lunch be prepared for a huge line and difficulty finding seating. The prices are a little up there, but it's appetizing nonetheless."}

{"text":"I really like Crisp. They have very high quality ingredients and a convenient location. It is never too crowded, which makes it pretty fast. Great for a casual lunch when you want something healthy but fast.

The staff have always been very nice and helpful and I would definitely recommend the salads at Crisp to a friend. I have tried their steak salad, asian salad, and salmon salad. The salmon was my favorite, and the asian was my least favorite :) 

The only reason they get 4/5 stars is because I feel like some of the salads are a little bit overpriced for the ambiance of the place. It is very casual inside- which isn't bad- just doesn't totally match the food!"}
{"text":"The line was long but it went fast and I was relieved to get a large fresh salad of mixed greens and grilled chicken.  Sometimes it's hard to find such a simple thing during the lunch rush but they did a great job.  I'm glad they just moved in!"}
{"text":"I think Lauren P. just about summarized it to the T. Crisp is a great place for fresh salads and sandwiches. This is how I broke down my rating: 

Quality of food - 4 stars - the food is well seasoned and very fresh. I had the grilled veggie sandwich and loved the basil and portobello combination. The pasta salad I got on the side was tasty too, it wasn't too heavy like the way some places make it, and it tasted as if they made it specifically for my order, not grabbed it out of a pre-made container. Or atleast that's the impression I got. 

Service - 5 stars - Not only was the staff very attractive, they were all incredibly friendly and professional. If I owned Crisp, I would be very happy with the people that were representing my business. Their communication skills and knowledge of the menu were terrific.

Atmosphere - 5 stars - Crisp has a simple clean sleek look with not a whole lot of busyness. The decor is modern and bare. It gets a ton of sunlight and has a relaxed vibe to it. If you have to dine inside, it's nice. However the outdoor seating is what really did it for me. The neighborhood is super quaint and charming, so getting a table outside in Charlotte's gorgeous spring weather is just perfect. You'll get to enjoy your food in a charming environment.

Side Notes - 
1) Crisp is vegan/vegetarian friendly. In our group of three, one was a vegetarian (me) and one was a vegan. We didn't have any problem with ordering food. 
2) If the adjacent parking lot is full, there is a parking lot right across the street that has plenty of spaces. 
3) After 6:30 on a Friday night it gets busy. We luckily got there right at 6:00 so we had our pick of the best table and didn't have to stand in line to place our orders. 

In my opinion, this is one of Charlotte's better places to eat. I will be glad to go back!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood today and in search of a quick bite to eat when I checked out Yelp and saw Crisp pop up. Bingo - just what I was in the mood for - a nice big salad.  After reading a couple of reviews, I decided to try the chicken bbq salad.  It came with grilled bbq chicken, roasted corn, tomatos, a little cheese and I asked them to hold the onions.  It was served with a side of ranch and a little crunchy bread. 

I was not disappointed.  The overall salad was tasty and the lettuce was nice & fresh.  The folks working there today were very friendly and helpful.  I was so glad I decided to give them a try! I'll definitely stop in again whenever I am in the neighborhood and looking for a nice big salad, sandwich, or wrap."}
{"text":"This place gets an A- from me. Reason being: the Tofu is good here - especially in the salads which is what I have - however it was a tad burnt. My friend got a spinach chicken wrap which he said was pretty good. Service is fairly quick. Good place for a grab and go healthy lunch. Kind of hidden away so you have to know it's there!"}
{"text":"My first time here but I must say that I will be back.  The restaurant is in a nice neighborhood around other restaurants.  Nice and clean establishment.  The only problem I saw was with the parking but they had a small strip mall on the side of the restaurant were you can find parking.  Be careful where you park because some spots are reserved for other restaurants.  The service was fast and on point, the food was fantastic and I can't wait to go back.  I should've took a pic of my food.  I had the BBQ Chicken salad, very good but by the time I remembered to take the pic I was already digging into the salad. LOL, I'll take pics next time.  Trust me you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Dion L. & I popped in here last night for dinner, as I hadn't been to this location yet. I love Crisp's 7th Street location, so I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed.

Walking in, the music was pumping some club feel jams...it could have been \"Club Crisp\" for the night!  It was 7 PM & there wasn't much customer traffic, so we were able to walk right in & place our orders.

We were cheerfully greeted by our salad maker & he was friendly & happy. He prepared my custom made shrimp salad with quickness & another pleasant employee brought it out to us.  

I have to echo a lot of what everyone else said about this location.  Ironically, it seems just about the same size as the 7th Street location."}
{"text":"Crisp: I love you! I normally have these Crisp cravings once a month, or more.

The concept is fantastic, in & of itself. The staff is friendly, but they want you to be quick with your selections, because you can count on there being plenty of people waiting in line behind you.

Consistency is key here, which is good. I generally see the same staff, same amount of patrons & am guaranteed the selection in the case is in perfect shape. I love that they're constantly keeping an eye on that case, shifting out the ingredients. 

They have pre-determined salads & then of course, make your own. I go with the spinach, grilled shrimp, chopped hard boiled eggs, Asian noodles, fresh mozzarella cheese, bacon & the ginger soy dressing.  The portions are generous & they give you a piece of bread, too.

I need to try their pizzas & sandwiches soon.

They allow well behaved dogs on the patio, which I love. They keep a fresh water bowl out there, too."}
{"text":"Not really my place for a salad. If I ever decide to give them another shot it would have to be for a sandwich. Ceaser salad was OK, but didn't seem as fresh as pictures make it seem. Bathroom area was ewww... nets flying around."}
{"text":"Not much of a salad guy, but this place is a salad lover's Mecca. 

Anything you want. Huge bowl. Lots of stuff. 

They do an amazing job with their grilled tofu and shrimp, too. Love the flavor. 

Not too keen on their beverages or their bread/side options. 

The tomato basil soup is a little on the bland side.

Make sure you're there when the cook who owns the salt shaker shows up. 

Love sitting outside though. Great place to eat at sunset. 

If you're the evening workout type, this is a an awesome place to grab something light before you head back home. 

I recommend the Chinese Shrimp Salad. Great combo of smokey, grilled shrimp and mandarin oranges.

Overall and Elizabeth staple for a quick and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I called 20 minutes ahead to place a to go order as I was on a trip back from Asheville, exhausted and just wanted to grab my food and go home. When I arrived 25 minutes later, they hadn't even started my salads. There was probably 7 customers in the whole restaurant and all were well through their meals. The girl apologized and said she had been in the bathroom. Yet 2 other employees were standing around doing nothing. I had to wait another 15 minutes for my salads.  The salads were very good & the bread was amazing. However the service is lacking & I probably won't ever return to this specific crisp because of it."}
{"text":"Stopped in purely because I saw someone walking around with one of their salads! 

I got the Cobb salad which came with chicken and was one of the cheaper salads. I was actually pleasantly surprised. It was much bigger than I though and was totally worth the price. I actually shared it with my boyfriend for lunch and it was enough for both of us!"}
{"text":"So good! Had the salmon with my salad. Quick and friendly service. Big selection. Will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food is good. They are a little liberal with the dressings, but then again who wants a 2-gallon salad.?

My last visit was this past Saturday just after lunch. I watched the gentleman mixing the salads and he looked really miserable to be there. When I finally got to order my salad the guy asked my wife what her name was, she didn't hear him, so he barked out the question once more. There were no pleasantries and he smacked every item into our FCN salad like it owed him money. I will not be going back to Crisp. Showmars across the street makes great salads and appreciate every customers patronage.

The next level of dissatisfaction came when we paid. We got one salad between the two of us along with two drinks. The girl at the counter looked frazzled and charged us twice the actual total.  I don't think she was purposely trying to cheat us, but she was just careless, a symptom of a lot of the restaurants in the area. She made it right, so no worries.

I am rare to judge a small business harshly because I am also in business for myself. But if the owner is reading this, please teach your employees to care about how they treat customers. That is not too much to ask."}
{"text":"Decent salads and sandwiches, but not the sort of place that makes me go, \"Oh, I crave that food!\""}
{"text":"Fresh Salads and Sandwiches.

This location is always packed around lunch time - so plan on a line. I am not a fan of the \"order your food, find a seat\" style places like Chipotle and Baja Fresh etc. because I hate not being able to get a table once I have my food, but there is usually a quick turn-around here, people don't tend to linger since by nature of the food, they are probably in a hurry if they popped in here for lunch.

I like the asian salad the best.
Small outdoor patio.

The bad thing is the line and the limited space. It can feel a little stuffy at times."}
{"text":"Crisp used to be my go to spot (at least once a week)for lunch on 7th street. Slowly leadership began changing and the turnover increased. With the new staff the food changed and so did the accuracy of my order.

I began going to East Blvd location and now the same issue has happened again. They have even hired some of the former employees from 7th st.

I am very sad to say I will no longer be eating at crisp. No matter how many times you ask and no matter how busy they are your food will not be correct."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and tasty! I built my own salad with salmon (no pesto, delicious!) and they were generous with portions and toppings. Very friendly staff and environment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was visiting town and looking for a healthy alternative for lunch and I found CRISP.  
It's a cute smal cafe that I absolutely love.  Decor is minimalist but my cup of tea!

They have tons of different salads, wraps and pizzas.  You can also build your own salad and the portion is on the big side.  I opted for the FCN (fruit cheese and nut) salad and added grilled salmon! The grilled salmon was fresh compared to alot of places I have tried.  I couldn't even finish my whole salad and was more than enough for a 2nd serving!

Stop by for a quick bite!! I wouldn't steer you wrong :)"}
{"text":"Crisp is worth going out of your way for, although I'm glad I won't have to!  This was one of the last places I tried my new neighborhood.  Now I'm totally hooked!  The salads are fresh, filling, and so tasty.  My favorite is the Chinese Shrimp (see my photo).  Haven't tried the sandwiches or pizzas, but they look awesome."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte on a business trip and were were in this side of town around lunch time. We were looking for something that looked quick and easy, and Crisp seemed like a good bet.

I got the Monterey sandwich, which was good. I opted to have a cup of soup with it instead of a side salad. And oh my goodness... way more soup than I was expecting. Definitely a bowl. The sandwich was a good size too, so I will definitely not complain about small portions at this place. For soup I got the carrot soup. Which was... not so great. It was, however, my first time having carrot soup, so perhaps it's just not my thing. I do like carrots tho, so was hoping to like it.

Anyhoo. It was quick and easy, which is what we needed. And seemed good overall."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I would have to give it 5 stars when it comes to that aspect, but some of the staff had bad attitudes."}
{"text":"This place alway have a special spot in my heart.. My go to when I'm trying really really hard to eat better. And I tried.. 

Crisp 5/5 offered a varieties of different type of salads with different type of proteins. Very easy to follow... For me, I like to customize my salads... alway love the salmon. Nicely cooked and it's grand portion. They also offer a few soups of the day. You won't be disappointed!

Customer service 5/5 they have alway been on point the few times I'm been there. They bring your bowl of salad to you and do check on you. 

Cleanliness: 4/5 on busy lunch.. I understand it's harder for them to keep up with busting the tables.. but they did their best.. and any other times. That place is clean to me. 

Overall, this will alway be that place for me!"}
{"text":"Salad was delicious (Cajun shrimp that was on special) and huge. But the atmosphere of the place was pretty unwelcoming. Guy behind the counter would mumble questions and not even look at us, another employee was blaring music on her phone behind the counter. The only person who probably knew what customer service was was the cashier."}
{"text":"The freshness and the quality of both the food and the service is beyond outstanding. The salad bar is just delightful, but if you are in the mood for something else, they have pizza and sandwiches as well!
Dinning out in their patio is also quite nice, it adds to the ambiance of this place.
It's a great location with a very cool concept."}
{"text":"Salad dressings could use a little kick but overall healthy good salads. Big portions. Good customer service!"}
{"text":"Sanitation is poor (cooks using bare hands and no hair nets). My wrap was awful. \"House roasted\" turkey was slimey and disgusting. If they roast that in house I'm Abe Lincoln. My wrap was annihilated before I even touched it, I think they put grill marks on them ahead of time thinking it presents well. All it did was destroy the structural integrity of the wrap. This place needs to be replaced with something decent IMO."}
{"text":"I came into the Dilworth location and ordered a  FCN with Salmon. 

I called the store to let them know that the salmon was bad and I was told by the manager that the fish was good, but it was not. The salmon has a greyish color and the fish smell was very loud. I would like to be refunded for the cost of the salmon. I even called back to the store and asked for the email address and no one in the store could provide me with the email address.

I think that is poor business! I will not be back and I will make sure that my company never uses them again."}
{"text":"This place is a win-win.  Great food, good service, amazing prices.  The music could use a little help but who cares!

I love this place.  The food is fresh and they give you generous portions.  One of the few healthy, cheap places to grab a quick bite.  They also have tofu options which is nice to see!

Very clean & the staff is always super helpful.  Next time you're in ask them their opinion, they have never steered me wrong.  Super nice folks."}
{"text":"I'm impressed and I'll be back. :)
I pass Crisp on a regular basis and decided to stop in for a late lunch, a good decision! I was over whelmed by the salads on the menu and the options for building my own...so I decided to try the Akropolis salad on their menu. When I have more time I'll be back to build my own. Everything looked (and tasted) super fresh, the decor was modern and chic, and the staff were very friendly. Well done!"}
{"text":"Too me, its a little expensive for a salad place, BUT the salads are great there.  They have the freshest ingredients and really good salads to choose from or you can build your own."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic.  I ordered the Bar-B-que chicken salad and then added some additional toppings.  I will be back often."}
{"text":"This place is back sliding fast. Slow, indifferent service and a dingy dining area equals not coming back. Too bad, because it used to be a great spot."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I eat here at least twice a week. I enjoy making up my own salads but have tried a few of their creations and they are so good! My faves are the BBQ chicken, Grilled Salmon, and the Steak salads. Not in the mood for salads? They also have sandwiches and daily soups... Probably my favorite place right now!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Huge and delicious FRESH salad and a peach mimosa? best day ever. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. If I lived in Charlotte I would be at this place everyday. Large selection of salads, the sandwiches and soups looked delicious too. Add sangria or a mimosa - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's a salad joint on a corner. I'd recommend a brighter green, you're a tiny place on a tiny corner next to a bigger corner. The inside is clean and bright and the employees are friendly though!

This place may have the most gigantic salad entree I have ever witnessed. I mean I finished it because I knew I'd need the calories to run errands later, but this may be the first time I have ever felt bloated after finishing a salad. I had a very interesting take on a nicoise salad here. Some of the usual accompaniments of a nicoise it was drenched in what was called a dijon mustard vinaigrette. I think it tasted more like a honey mustard vinaigrette. Interesting. I wouldn't call it a nicoise salad definitely but the price was low enough and the ingredients fresh enough for me to enjoy it. I also liked the cheesy croutons served with the salad.

So if you like dinosaur sized portions, and fresh ingredients come on down to Crisp. Tell them to leave the dressing on the side though."}
{"text":"Large Salads -Good but not Outstanding.

Two weeks ago we were going to try Crisp for Lunch after Church but for some reason, the GPS put us on the side street behind the shopping center they are in and there is no connection. Ended up Lebowski's but after lunch, we found the location with their help and bookmarked it to try again.

Today was that day. Raining Cats and Dogs during out drive down from Cornelius and it looks like we were their first customers.

I had the Build your own salad and I started with mixed Greens, Flank Steak, tomatoes cumcumbers, feta cheese, onions and black olives with a balsamic dressing. Watched them make it and it was an impressive thing to watch.

My wife ordered the Salmon Salad which is a standard menu item and brought here own dressing.

My salad was good and the portion size was hugh.

My wife liked the Salmon but not a fan of the rest of the salad. Said the bed of greens had too many course stems which to her made the salad rather course.

Staff is friendly and the dining area is neat and clean. Restrooms could use a bit of work however in terms of emptying the trashcans.

All it all, it was pretty good and while I would not make a special trip from Cornelius, I would give it another shot if I were already in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come for a good salad. I am a salad person and can eat them everyday!!! I love this place. I am disappointed however because of the parking. It is horrible....but the food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM!!  After my bad make-your-own salad experience recently at Big Daddy's I was thrilled with Crisp.  The salads are huge and they have an awesome selection of salad dressings (the mustard vinaigrette and the russian are both nice) and they toss everything up chop salad style (but will give you dressing on the side).  They also have sandwiches  and pizza, which I haven't tried.  Overall, a very crunchy experience."}
{"text":"My first time at Crisp. The review where OK not great but I like to try things out myself. 

Its small inside with outdoors eating. I don't see myself eating inside bc of the tight space. It was not many ppl in there eating but as I was walking out my pocketbook was bumping the chairs and table( due to the tight walk space). 

I called my order in over the phone. They have online ordering  but you have to create an account and I did not feel like doing all of that. 

The salad was good. I paid 7.50 for mine. It was a LOT which is great. I really enjoyed my salad. I will most definitely eat there again. 

NOW MY CO-Worker did find a piece of hair in her salad. She was upset because she said her salad was REALLY GOOD. Once she seen that hair it was over."}
{"text":"Crisp features a small menu on which one can choose various mediums for a section of proteins.  example:  salad with fresh turkey, sandwich with the same, so-on.  all of the meals are made to order right in front of you.  Salads...you select a number of supplemental adjuncts which vary day-to-day.  All very fresh.  A great lunch choice, a moderate but small wine selection, and a patio which lends itself well to people watching.
If you've ever been to the Sacramento Area; it's exactly like Pluto's.
I highly recommend it if you're stuck in the Elizabeth area of Char-town and you're needing some fresh fare at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food is great and the service is very nice regardless of the craziness of lunch hour. The only reason for not 5 stars is long wait during lunch time. They seem to need a better system for streamlining the ordering process."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews but I have been coming here regularly since they opened, and always loved it but over the last few months the quality has gotten terrible. The website specifically says they have portobello mushrooms and kalamata olives, although I believe they used to be a delicious marinated sliced white mushroom. The last two times I have had my husband pick salads up from there I have ended up with canned mushrooms and canned black olives. This might sound petty, but as a vegetarian, these two items used to pack my salads with flavor. Now it is just pathetic. It ends up a soggy bland mess. Management, please step up your game. I would like to continue to frequent your establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way out of town and was impressed with the salad and the sandwich.  Also tried the cream of corn soup and was less than impressed - the soup was too sweet, and there wasn't much corn in it.  The sandwich we tried (Monterrey chicken melt) was good - lots of chicken, bacon, and cheese, on nicely toasted bread.  The pasta salad side was good as well.  We also split an Asian salad with tilapia as the protein (default is chicken).  The fish was good, as was the salad.  A bit pricey (~20+) for two, but good food that is somewhat healthy.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Crisp doesn't stand out from the street since it's in a mini shopping center next to a shopping center.  However, I decided to stop in on a beautiful day since they have a cute patio.  I really enjoyed their menu.  I'm a huge salad and wrap kinda girl and they had plenty to choose from.  I decided to go with a steak cobb salad.  You can pick how you would like to have your steak cooked (always a plus).  The chef (?) made the salad in front of me and listened to my personal requests (little of this, some extra of that).  After I paid for my lunch, the cashier said she would bring my food out to me since the steak was still being cooked.  She was so friendly and asked if I needed anything else when she delivered my food.  On top of that, she came out about 20 minutes later and took my bowl inside for me.  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.  The salad was great.  Next time I'll try a sandwich.  A customer also eating outside told me you can't go wrong with anything at Crisp.  My total bill with a drink was $10.  I'll be returning!

PS - The location is fantastic for \"people watching\" at P-stones patio."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a well-priced, customizing salad spot? I've had Chopt (and several variations of this dining concept) and Just Fresh locally; I feel Crisp boasts the best value and ingredient variety, as well as a relaxed atmosphere. I loved not being rushed through a line or pressured to have my meal thought up. Carnivores must try the balsamic grilled tofu! It's divine. I'll definitely be back for to-go orders."}
{"text":"They were very friendly ! You have to wait for your protein of choice to be cooked so you will pay and sit and wait till they bring your food ! But it taste awesomeeee!"}
{"text":"Love this salad place! 

This is a small place on the corner of 7th and Pecan, right next to Starbucks. Small place but great outdoor sitting, so perfect on a nice day.

Their salads are fresh and their servings are a nice size, you can have leftover if you ask for dressing on the side. They make them right in front of you so you can pick and choose what you want on them. I've had their salmon salad, salmon is always perfectly cooked. They also do sandwiches and soups which are fresh and tasty as well. Ohh and the serve wine!

Perfect for grabbing a quick lunch or sit outside and enjoy the day."}
{"text":"I prefer Chopt or Reid's. I ordered a salad and they brought it out with different ingredients than were listed on the menu. I mentioned something to them about it and they just said \"Oh. Really?\" And did not offer to correct my order. Not bad. I would just say that if an item is listed a certain way on the menu, it should be served that way so there is not confusion over what you purchased."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service, so bad worth writing this review. Lunch time could not serve customers in time and food coming our way too fast while waiting to pay took forever. In my case, my to go order was sitting in the back counter for 20 minutes and it is by far not worth this $10 salad."}
{"text":"Meh. Feeling very indifferent about this place. Walked in and the employee at the counter was texting. Greeted me and told me \"I'll be with you in a second\", finished her text, and walked up to me.

Now, the food. I had the turkey sandwich with greens, Brie, and cranberry dressing. I will say, the turkey is a little thick. It also just doesn't taste good quality wise. It's rubbery and gross. Pasta salad though was amazing... so who knows... maybe I'll go there again and try something different. Not that convinced though."}
{"text":"I've been to Crisp several times and the salads are very good. I took a star away because the proteins are often over cooked. 

I'd like to suggest preparing the tofu a different way. It tastes like it's been fried and it's very chewy. Perhaps the person that came up with the tofu option is not actually a fan of eating it! Marinating the tofu in balsamic and then roasting it would give it a more pleasant texture. Heck, plain uncooked tofu would probably be better!"}
{"text":"After a weekend that involved two meals of barbecue and attending a chili cookoff, I was ready for something light and healthy. 

I was nervous when the guy making my Steakhouse salad asked his coworker which lettuce was romaine - and when he accidentally put chicken on my salad - but it turned out he was a new employee in training. The fresh food and great atmosphere of this salad-and-sandwich shop made up for the frustration I felt when ordering. My salad was really good and my boyfriend liked his Chicken Caesar salad.

There are about a dozen salads you can try or you can make your own. They cook the meat to order for each salad, something I was impressed with. I'd much rather have my steak made for my order than sitting in some plastic container all day. They've also got some soup and sandwich options that I'll have to try next time. 

I was very pleased with Crisp and excited to find a new lunch place."}
{"text":"First off....I can't believe I just got around to trying this place!!!! The staff is super friendly, they are quick/efficient, and my salad was absolutely delicious!!! Did I mention I came back the same week?!!!! A must try and I will be back soon. I ordered the FCN...new favorite salad :-)"}
{"text":"We went with a party of 10 at a good time - 2:30pm - on a Saturday and it was nice and roomy for our group. None of us had ever been there before but we left all quite satisfied. The prices are excellent for a nice, healthy, salad. Almost everyone ordered a different dish and most left either with leftovers to take home, or filled from the generous portions. I had the Asian salad and was happy with the tender chicken and how it was seasoned. The only downside is all the extra ingredients (Chinese noodles, mandarin oranges, etc.) ended up on the bottom of the bowl and were hard to get to in the bites. We were not big fans of the cheddar soup, though, as we found it a bit too thick. Loved the tasty, crispy, cheese toast. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at the Crisp in Elizabeth and really enjoyed it. Having moved, the East Blvd location is now closer. We decided to have lunch there today, and it was pretty underwhelming. 

I got the special, a teriyaki chicken salad and my wife got the grilled salmon salad. 

Mine: entirely too much dressing, stale crostini & Asian noodles, soggy and all around meh. 

Hers: bland and colorless salmon, she asked for dressing on the side and never got it, flavorless and all around yuck. 

The lackluster food, combined with what appeared to be the \"b squad\" staff (common courtesy anyone?) secured this as a place we won't ever be visiting again. For $20, I can make two salads I'll actually enjoy."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time today for lunch & we were thoroughly pleased!!  I built my own salad that had a great variety of toppings and very fresh ingredients.  Crisp, if you will:)  They had soups on special that were unique- including cauliflower parm & carrot.  The portions are HUGE.  The guy who took our food order was full of suggestions and knowledge while the girl who rang us up was super friendly and delivered our food to us.  They clean the dishes from the table.  Great spot & will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are a great combination of flavors and are large enough to make two meals out of! Salads are good and the dressings are full of flavor. Giving 4 stars because of the price, but then again healthier food is always more expensive isn't it? I'm not typically a salad eater but this place may just change that! Try the Asian Chicken Salad or the Turkey Gobbler sandwich. With brie and cranberry sauce the Turkey Gobbler is like Thanksgiving between two slices of bread! Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Crisp Cobb Salad.  I like that they make the salad in front of you and toss the dressing.  My boyfriend got the Chicken Caesar Salad, both salads were equally amazing!  I'm sure Crisp will become one of my regular stops during the week.  I want to try their wraps, sandwiches, and pizza's as well."}
{"text":"I used to live very near Crisp, so I always longed for this little corner shop to be a great restaurant. The place that was here before was awful...it kind of worked with the same concept of fresh salads and sandwiches, but it failed to follow through. It's a great venue, but the place before had this icky iceberg lettuce, and they gave you salad dressing packets like from the elementary school cafeteria.

I am sad I've moved away now that Crisp is in the area! It's a great little addition to this wonderful neighborhood. My grilled veggie sandwich was perfect, and the balsamic reduction gave it the ideal burst of flavor. 

I'll definitely be back again and again. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of many fruits and veggies.  For that reason, I find it hard to eat salads, particularly pre-made ones.  With that being said, I am actually a big fan of Crisp.  I like the fact that I can design my own salad and pick and choose what I want on it...and the salads are very good.  Two salads usually cost us around $20, which isn't bad because they have freshly made \"protein\" and are pretty big."}
{"text":"Wonderful salads, fresh veggies. Wide selection of build your own salads or try one of theirs. I had salmon salad, excellent!"}
{"text":"Crisp offers delicious, quick fresh salads and sandwiches that come in big portions. Order from the menu or customize your own salad, you'll have plenty of options. My grilled salmon salad was super tasty with the salmon grilled while you wait.

Service was friendly and quick, seating was plentiful for a Thursday evening, and parking easy to find."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Love this place. And the Starbucks next door. I'm always in this area.  Great location. Love the ambiance. We usually sit outside. Delicious salads. I always get a salmon Caesar. Fast and great service. It's about 11 dollars I think with my drink. Well worth it. If you love good healthy food, come here. Def love this crisp. The other one is cool I just like this one better. That pesto on the salmon tho...yum. My family is addicted to it too. Nothing crazy just fresh and healthy ingredients. Amazing staff. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"I expected an energetic friendly staff when I visited this restaurant as it is new.  Instead the staff was rude and lazy.  I will not go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for a quick guilt-free meal. Or a monstrous chicken and bacon sandwich. Depends on my mood. Oh and they have decent wine and beer as well.

I've been here about 7 times now and have tried everything from the make your own salad to the sandwiches.

Salads:
I have a kind of love/hate relationships with these salads. I love that you can choose from an array of toppings (from veggies, nuts, eggs, and bacon) and that everything always looks fresh. It allows you to mix things up from day to day as opposed to the habit of 'Santa Fe Tuesdays' and 'Caesar Sundays'. Variety is indeed a spice that can be served up at Crisp. Plus yes, these salads are ginormous. 

Ok, on to the kinda hate side. The protein is very often (but not always) over-grilled. Meaning burnt. There, I said it. I am all about adding some intriguing texture to tofu or having some black grill lines on my chicken. However, I noticed that no matter what protein I get, be it tofu or chicken, it often tastes the same--burnt. Possible carcinogens aside, burnt is a flavor that tends to dominate the palette. My solution is becoming to just avoid getting protein all together.

Sandwiches:
Ok, sandwich. I've only had the Monterrey twice now. It is pretty much cheese, chicken bacon, lettuce, and some sauce. It is actually pretty darn good AND comes with a side (soup, salad, or some other thing). This makes for a pretty complete and filling meal. And when they say bacon, they don't mean no two strips of bacon. No, they are talking every square inch and bread and chicken is covered with crumbled bacon. Like equal parts chicken with equal parts bacon. Bacon bacon bacon. This is of course the less healthy way to eat at crisp, but hey it comes with a salad so you can feel that you've done some good.

My grip about the sandwich is two-fold. First, it can suffer from the same aforementioned burnt issue (however, this is somewhat mitigated through the prolific use of bacon. Seriously, next time I get a sunburn I am gonna rub bacon all over my skin).  

Second, inconsistency. The first time I had the sandwich, it literally blew my mind. It was freakin HUGE. Equal parts bacon, chicken, and lettuce. The chicken was sliced somewhat thinly and easy to eat. Likewise, the lettuce was thick and crispy, succeeding well as a placebo to counteract the bacon-induced guilt.

However, the second time, I literally had an uncut chicken breast on my bread, still generously covered with bacon, but with only one leaf of lettuce that I only discovered by poking around in my sandwich. Without this placebo lettuce, I was left feeling more guilty than I knew I could. A little lackluster.

Oh well. Until next time Crisp!"}
{"text":"I'm getting back into the whole healthy eating thing, which means I'm back to salads.  More importantly, make-your-own salads...my favorite!  The Crisp in Dilworth is a cute location located in a shopping center on East Blvd.  I periodically stroll in when I'm in the mood for a salad during lunch.  They have nice seating (both inside and out) and the staff is incredibly friendly.  They also have some really interesting flavors of potato chips that I've never seen before that are really good.

Crisp is a decent place, but there are a few things that would convince me to give it an extra star or two:
-Need more variety of toppings and lettuce.  The toppings they have are good and fresh, but there aren't very many choices.  Would also love to have some kale!
-Speed up the service a bit.  I don't expect fast food speeds, but sometimes it takes a good 15-20 minutes to wait in line to order a salad.
-Have some meats prepared and ready to go.  It's frustrating when you see your salad sitting in the back waiting for the protein to be added.  It really slows down the process."}
{"text":"4 stars for emotional value -- so glad to have found a \"make-your-own\" salad place here in Charlotte!!!! But I wish they had more variety in toppings -- they didn't have fresh onions or beets. AND 5 toppings are kind of slim -- I'm used to getting 7 toppings standard back home. Can't really do much with 5 toppings. BUT... YAY FOR SALAD!!"}
{"text":"Four stars because i ordered the mahi mahi it was super dry didn't want to return because I just want my stuff made right the first time. The salad was good but the soy hunger dressing was nasty period bland!!! Would I oh back yes!"}
{"text":"Crisp is my go-to place for a clean, healthy meal. Their salads are huge, the sandwiches are fresh, and everything is made to order. I recommend taking your food out to the patio, which sits at the intersection of Pecan Avenue and 7th Street - great for people watching. Add a glass of wine (on Mondays wine is 1/2 off) and you'll be set. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just like its original sister restaurant in Elizabeth, this second location for Crisp offers the same menu of fresh made salads, soups, and sandwiches, prepared to order as you wait.  When looking for something on the lighter side, Crisp remains an excellent option.

The new location sports the same modern feel with muted tones of green and brown throughout the space, along with wooden vine accents neatly tucked into a few places.  As with the original, you walk in the door here and go right to the counter to order, where you can watch your salad come together in less than two minutes.  Specials of the day are prominently posted and many are worth a try.  For orders that require a bout more prep, servers will bring your order to your table.  Servers will also clear your table for you once you leave.  Tipping is actively encouraged, though you will still need to get your own drink and refills.

Prices here appear unchanged, and remain just a tad high, in my opinion, for what you get.  Still, there is no arguing with the freshness and emphasis on quality vegetables, fruits and nuts to enhance the dish.  Certainly makes the burrito and burger shops look like that fat slob of a cousin you only claim on holidays.  You, meanwhile, can run around lean and trim, knowing you didn't kill your calorie count for the day over a single meal."}
{"text":"Look, there's nothing wrong with a 3 star review- I just see potential here that needs a little more development.  I live in the neighborhood and we can walk to this restaurant.  But yet I find myself first looking to go elsewhere before strolling just in for a meal.

Certainly there's lots to love here in the atmosphere set:  very modern interior with bright green splashes of color on the walls and a semi-open kitchen where the salads are crafted.  During warmer times, the patio, with its bright green umbrellas, is also a big draw even if busy 7th Street is just a few steps away.  

Certainly the salads and sandwiches are all looking and sounding full of freshness and there's lots to love with the customization options for dressing or veggie substitutions.  Love the fact there's usually a (bottled) beer special and a small selection of wine available.  Me, I'm partial to the fresh brewed iced tea and lemonade.  Even better: mix the two for an Arnold Palmer that screams summertime thirst quencher.  

But perhaps it's the fast food concept with sit-down restaurant prices that puts me off.  With an average price of $8.50 for a salad or sandwich (that's a singular \"a\" there folks), I just don't think I should have to stand in line and then watch most of my meal made before me in less than a minute.  I could do that at Subway, Jersey Mike's, or Substation for about $5.00.  Now, yes, there are some ingredients here you won't find at the chains, but if I'm dropping a 10-spot on lunch, I don't want to watch you swirl it all together in a stainless steel bowl with a pair of tongs in 60 seconds or less.  For that kind of informality, I feel like the prices should be equally relaxed.  Sigh... 

That said, it is an occasional stop for the wife and I when we want a light lunch close to home.  It is tasty and it always feels exceptionally clean, but those items come at an obvious premium since you still order at a counter and drink refills are on you."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat if you are around this area and have a craving for a salad service is good as well but this place can be very forgettable"}
{"text":"So I was craving a salad today for lunch and bypassed my usual Jason's Deli salad bar and went out of my way to try out Crisp instead. I typically get the BBQ Chicken Salad and have always loved it! Today I got a build your own....was not very impressed.

While some of the ingredients were great, and the dressing had a nice punch to it....some were lacking. 

I think I can basically sum it up by saying that I would have preferred my apples be crispier than my chicken.....that was not the case."}
{"text":"I....am.....concerned. I have really been a Crisp fan ever since moving to the area. I love the made to order salads. The food has been good and fresh. But now I'm worried. The last two or three times I've been, there seems to be a management/employee problem. I've had to wait a much longer time than before, they didn't have water available for the longest time (I went ahead and just poured some tea), tables weren't wiped off. It was just kind of a mess the last time I went. The time before that I waited a really long time for a takeout. It made me late to where I was heading.

So bottom line is: I want you back Crisp - from the service standpoint. The food continues to be good. I will come back again but it would be great to have you back to where you were a year or so ago."}
{"text":"First time visitor. I had the create your own which included fresh spinach and grilled salmon. The next time I will get my dressing on the side because the salad was huge and I couldn't eat it all. This is now one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick clean bite. There are a lot of fresh, healthy options. In addition to salads they also offer sandwiches and wraps."}
{"text":"Aaaah, Crisp, if only you were closer. I'd be 10 pounds skinnier and 10x more satisfied w/the local food options. I met the owner a while ago and he said they've been watching the LKN market for possible expansion and I am anxiously awaiting. 

The salads are as fresh as they come, w/everything under the sun available for your mixing pleasure. The asian salad is my favorite, sub the oranges w/cranberries...nomnomnom. The line can get lengthy and seating is sparse at lunch, so arrive early or come on the weekend, but don't miss out on these awesome salads and creative sandwiches. Meals that taste awesome and don't make you fat = win/win!"}
{"text":"I've only been a few times because I have a general rule against going out for things that can be so easily made at home. BUT I was in the area and craving something in the vein of a salad or sandwich, so this place is where I ended up. 

The service was super friendly. That's the part that really endeared me, is how kind of welcoming the staff were. The food was every bit as good as I'd expect. I mean, it's salads so there's only so much you can do, but the ingredients were fresh and the salad was GIGANTIC. I had a hard time finishing it, to be honest. 

Don't know that I'd make it a point to go here on the regular but glad I gave it a try."}
{"text":"I'm always on a quest for a great salad, and this place has a great selection of them.  However, like other reviewers said, you do need to watch for overcooked, charred meat.

I really like that they have some wonderful salad selections.  I ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad, and the veggie selection was great.  I enjoyed that it was spring mix instead of just plain old iceberg.  It was served with a lemon vinaigrette, which added a great complement to the salad.  The salad was quite big as well.  However, my salmon was quite overcooked, and part of it tasted burnt.  It was definitely charred, which is a huge turn-off with fish and some meat.

I also like that you can build your own salad as well.  My friend did that and really enjoyed her salad.  You can also have a glass of wine or a bottle of beer, which is quite refreshing.

While they don't have waiter service, people do come around and check on you.  One worker came to collect our wine glasses and then did bring us more wine.  He also came and settled that bill for us.  The staff was all super nice and helpful.  The decor is very spring-like, with warm greens and spring colors.  It was cute.

Next time I come back, I think I'll build my own salad and skip the meat."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, the pasta salad was ok - but for pasta salad it was a pretty good portion. Doesn't seem to be a ton of parking, but overall a nice lunch spot. Wish I could give a half star for the music they were playing all of my favorites!! Think Amy Winehouse Pandora station.. not sure if my visit was the norm but I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I plan  on trying a salad the next time."}
{"text":"We went before their full menu was available, but it was an okay experience. I had the roasted veggie sandwich; itwas what you would expect it to be. They do make everything to order and if you're a salad person, they'll build it right in front of you.

I'd likely go back if I were on that side of town."}
{"text":"Since my last post I have visited Crisp at least once a month for a delicious yet filling salad. Recently I have been drawn to creating my own salad with all of the fresh toppings they have to offer. My personal favorite is the balsamic vinegarette dressing! This is still a great option that my boyfriend and I use when we're looking for a quick hit delicious option after we've been eating crummy for a few days. The Dilworth location also did not disappoint when we visited that store. Stay fresh, Crisp!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always consistently fresh and great tasting. My favorite lunch place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Oh me oh my this was SO what I needed on a sunny Thursday.

A plethora of vegetables and toppings to choose for a salad, innovative sandwiches and scrumptious sounding soups. I had the hardest time choosing and so I asked the guy at the counter what he would recommend for a veggie loving vegan. Being vegan himself, he whipped up a southwestern salad with bbq tofu. It was amazing (but a little steeply priced).

The interior decor is relaxing and very open. The staff were all friendly (that I spoke to at least). I was very, very happy with my food. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"After being told by pretty much everyone I know to come here, I finally stopped in today. I'm glad I did: this could become a go-to of mine. Their menu struck me as a little small--just not that many options, but what they did have was really good. High quality veggies and meats, made well and to your satisfaction. 

Parking wasn't a problem, although it was pretty crowded during the lunch crunch. There's also a nice outdoor seating area, but it was way too cold today to sit out there, and no one was; this made it even more packed inside. 

Like someone else said, this reminds me of a Cali-style sandwich/salad place, which is a good thing. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This was the third time I gave Crisp (in Elizabeth) a chance...never again!

The first time I ordered the Asian salad for take out and it was delicious.  Naturally, I thought that it would be a great thing to order the second time. I was so very wrong!  I asked for the dressing to be put on the side so that I could put the amount on that I like (just as I had done the first time).  What I got was my Asian salad completely doused in dressing and no chicken at all-- because they forgot it!

I decided to give Crisp one last try tonight and was pleased to see that they had remembered the chicken and they had remembered to put the dressing on the side.  I put the salad dressing on as I liked it and took a bite.  What I got was a mouthful of salad and OIL!!!  There was no soy-ginger dressing as was ordered, it wasn't even oil and vinegar!  It was just OIL!!!  I paid $9.00 for this totally inedible salad!!!  (Including the 2nd time it was a waste of $18.00!!!). 

I have learned my lesson and then some!!!  Crisp is a HUGE disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Crisp is amazeballs. Fantastic, healthy salads at reasonable prices. Emphasis on the healthy part because a lot of \"salad\" places drench their romaine-based salads in a heavily oil or cream-based dressing. Not so with Crisp, where you can select from a large variety of veggies with a light dressing on a spinach base. Also, the meat is fresh-grilled: my salad came out with the seasoned halibut still steaming. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"Wonderful salads that are enough for two people.  Haven't tried their pizza but they look great. As Borat says \"Very Niiice.\""}
{"text":"Awful. 

Arrived early for my daughter's appointment at Levine Children's Hospital up the road and decided to come here for lunch based on Yelp reviews. 

My wife and I orders at the same time - she got a salad made to order with cooked shrimp and I got a turkey wrap. They completely forgot my order. Wrap said it was made with turkey roasted in store but it tasted like deli meat turkey - slimey, gelatinous, and had virtually no taste. The rest of the ingredients were fine but the turkey ruined the whole thing. 

All this for $23 (salad, wrap, and 1 drink)? No thanks. 

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, quality is inconsistent.  

1st time, Wednesday lunch {( 4 star )}

I had the steak salad - one of the best salads I've ever had.  Got me to come back.
Crostini was meh.  But who cares, I was paying for a great salad!

=======================

2nd time was a Sunday at lunch... {( 3 star )}

This time I had the salmon salad.  Not so lucky. Salmon was cooked well (needed salt) but the flavors didn't go we'll together.  The kalamata olives are good but overpowered the fish.   The dressing was oilier than flavorful which was a turn off. I won't be getting the salmon again but will be back to try a shrimp and chicken dish. 

Now, my wife (vegetarian) on the other hand got the acropolis (Greek salad) and loved it.  She already has her next 4 meals here planned. 

The salad prep guy needs a little better memory; he had to ask me and my wife twice (each), only about 45 seconds apart.   He was a little hard to hear, had to ask him to repeat himself. 

Friendly enough service, a little reserved. 

=======================

3rd time, not as good as previous visits {( 2 star... :(  )}

Chicken was bland (like another user experienced) and was closer to fast-food quality.  Dressing wasn't mixed well again - to the point I decided to say something.  The cashier got me more dressing but had shaken the dressing bottle well - it was much better then.  Not sure why a cashier could do it properly when the line \"chef\" wouldn't.   

I'll go back to try the shrimp or if my wife wants to go, but the last two visits haven't been impressive."}
{"text":"Has potential to be great. Need consistency in quality. The home made dressings are oily and have little flavor.  The meats are rarely seasoned well and can be on the well-done side.  The crustini is pretty unusual (not in a good way) and could double as a giant crouton  

If you're afraid of flavors and juicy chicken, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went in for some of their turkey and black bean chili and it was some of the best!!! Always fresh ingredients! Manager came and checked on me and all the people around me! The one thing was I got a salad one time and it had lots of greens just not a lot of toppings but maybe I just didn't look hungry that day :)! Good place good location and right next to Starbucks! Will go back"}
{"text":"Little pricey for a salad at lunch but WOW it was good! I did the Cobb w/ grilled chicken on top with a bottle of water and was $15 after a $2 tip. Super clean, outside seating available, and fast service."}
{"text":"As much as I visit Crisp it's a wonder why I didn't update my review sooner.  This place has become by go-to lunch spot on days when I work from home and even sometimes when I have to stop home for lunch.

I've still never had a sandwich here but always stick to the salads.   The salads are tossed to order. You can select from one of their options on the menu or create your own.  

The staff is great here.  Even on their craziest of days which is between 11:30 am and 1pm, the staff is friendly and willing to get your order taken care of.  

My only criticism is that when you get your order to go, there is little space to sit/stand and wait.  I am usually crammed next to the drink station."}
{"text":"I was out running around today and decided to try something new for lunch.  Crisp has been on my bookmark list for ages so this is where I ended up.

The idea is a great.  Custom-made salads where you can see them make it in front of you, or you can choose one of their regular options.  They also do sandwiches here.

I went with the Crisp Cobb which came with a Dijon dressing.  I watched for a while as they made it but I think they went a bit overboard on the dressing.  I should have asked for it on the side.

The cashier said it would be the best salad I ever tasted.  Ok, well it wasn't.  It wasn't bad but I've had better salads elsewhere in Charlotte.  The bacon was too hard, it hurt my teeth.  The eggs were good.  I would have liked a lighter dressing and it seemed lacking on other vegetables...tomatoes, cukes, etc.

It was worth trying and if I'm in the area again, I'll try to increase my rating for Crisp.  Maybe next time I'll try something different that will be \"the best salad I ever tasted\"."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite for awhile now. The steak sandwich is killer. The salads are fresh.

However, the last time I went the steak in the salad was low grade and difficult to chew. 

I think it might be slipping. I hope I'm wrong.

Heads up- it is very busy during the week for lunch. Call ahead."}
{"text":"The patio is nice, but I just didn't enjoy the salad that much.  It was the Asian Salad & I got it with flank steak instead of chicken.  

Tons of spinach, not so much romaine.  The steak was a bit gristly & chewy.

My sweet D was so excited about me trying it, but he even said that it wasn't as good as the first time he was there.

The staff was friendly & in good moods.

Maybe I would go back, but probably not."}
{"text":"I stopped into Crisp for a quick bite before going to a show at Ovens auditorium with friends. With a convenient location and quick food delivery, it was the perfect choice.

The interior decoration is cute and the service was amazing. You order your food at the salad bar where an employee with customize your salad with any of the ridiculously large number of options available. They will then grill up your protein to order and bring the salad out to you while you wait (takes approximately 5-7 minutes). I had the tuna nicoise salad and it was one of the best I've ever tried. All the ingredients were very fresh and the dressing was fabulous; probably the best homemade dressing I've ever had. Salads run anywhere from around $7 to $10 and are so large that you could easily make two meals out of them.

I've only been once and tried the salad, so can't vouch for the other food, but if it's as good as the salad, you won't be disappointed. The restuarant offers sandwich and pizza options, and a very large patio for sitting outside (with a glass of wine or a beer, which are both offered) when the weather allows. Bathrooms were clean and the parking was sufficient. I highly recommend Crisp for a healthy and quick meal."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at crisp this is not unique in concept, but well executed. It's a great salad bar restaurant with awesome proteins to add. I enjoy having their Caesar salad  with chicken it was cooked to perfection and the dressing was flavorful. I will say to find a park at the Elizabeth location can be a challenge however it's a great place to have a light lunch or sensible dinner."}
{"text":"Echoing a previous review: the Crisp website says they are open until 9pm every day. I showed up at 7:30 on a Sunday and they were closed. How hard is it to update their website with accurate hours? Very unlikely I'll be returning..."}
{"text":"I went with the special which was seared ahi tuna, kalamata olives, feta, roasted red peppers, artichokes and avocado (added), tossed with mixed greens and a shallot vinaigrette ...sounds all sorts of fantastic right? 

Well it was just ok, unfortunately. I think I picked the wrong salad for my taste because it was way too acidic - and I should have known this based on the ingredients.The shallot vinaigrette needed some evoo badly, which didn't help things..as I poured before tasting-bad move.  I also had to ask the lady to check and be sure that they included avocado which I paid extra for, and lo and behold it wasn't included. They ended up giving me such a little portion of the avocado that I would skip it next time. I don't mind paying $11 for a salad if it is awesome, this was fresh but not as tasty as I'd hoped it would be. 

On a positive note- the salad was huge so you can probably get two meals out of it . The service was very quick-making it an ideal place for a take-out lunch. I also really enjoyed have a slew healthy lunch options.

I will be back to try something else and hopefully tack on another star or two..."}
{"text":"This location is beautiful inside! The Chinese shrimp salad was amazing. And the new general manager, Jordan is awesome at what he does. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The food is almost always good here.  Seems fresh and the salad bar looks clean. Tonight though there were plenty of people working the restaurant, yet 4 tables and the bar are all dirty, with half eaten bowls creating an unappetizing atmosphere to eat my dinner in."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this overall enterprise ever since they opened on 7th within the last 10 years. I watched 7th St decline, I was never as impressed with East Blvd as I was 7th St, but as 7th St declined, what options did I have? As I gently made the transition, it became increasingly more and more difficult to find East Blvd open when my tummy was growling. Ok, I became more diligent about changing my life to match their potential hours. Now, as I seem to have worked my life around their hours, sadly, the quality just STINKS! Where is my Crisp from when it began? Portion? Way smaller. Oh, I called the order in for a pick up and while the protein of my choice was not available, there is NO excuse to be out of ANY of the other items. None. If anyone has been lately, this place isn't exactly cheap -- expect to pay minimum of $10 per person. For this price, I expect better than what I've been receiving. Sadly, IMHO, it won't be long before these doors also close. So very sad, great concept, just poor execution."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times ever since they opened close to ten years ago. I have introduced many, many people to this restaurant and highly recommended it. Tonight, I had the worst dining experience ever. If I were to rate the food, I would give it five stars. The noise level from the food prep people who were using the tin bowls while they were making the custom salads was so loud it was impossible to have a conversation. Allow me to be clear -- this was NOT while the salads were being prepped -- this was post salad production and between customers and getting ready for the next rush. Additionally, the choice in music, in my opinion, was not family friendly. There was a relatively young family in the dining room when we were there and very blatantly in the music lyrics - were words I wouldn't want my children to hear in a restaurant environment. I will not repeat them in this post, suffice it to use your imagination with a combination of the letters M and F. Again. This is my opinion, and in your household if that language is appropriate, then you would not be offended."}
{"text":"I can't work on a Best Salads in Charlotte list without adding Crisp. Crisp is fabulous and affordable with huge portions. It's exactly what you expect from a good salad and is a favorite spot whenever I'm in Charlotte. 

Definitely goes on my Yelp list."}
{"text":"Unbelievable salads and sandwiches. I just can't get enough.  Pick up a free apple on your way out to fight the 3 PM munchies."}
{"text":"I was always intrigued by this restaurant every time I passed by it. I had a friend coming over and she suggested to pick up Crisp for a to go order. 

I got the romaine lettuce with corn, grilled onions, bacon, monterrey and jack cheese and steak. I asked my steak to be cooked medium rare and it was more on the medium well side. The corn was very delicious and flavorful. The grilled onions were tender and sooooo good. The bacon was huge!! Huge chunks and crispy. The onion dressing was good. I usually like extra dressing but I really didn't need a lot of it because the steak was just packed with flavors. 

Another error they made was they switched me and my friend's meats. She got turkey and  I got the steak and mine was on hers and hers was on mine. Not a big deal for me but it was for my friend because she is not a fan of any red meat. 

The few errors can be forgiven. I would definitely go again. Some people complain about their salads being expensive but they are really worth it. I easily had two servings in my one salad and it was filled with all the yummy goodies I picked to go in it."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon, the cashier was not very warm  or friendly, not rude, but definitely not customer friendly. There was water spilled on the floor which someone finally went outside to a news rack got a newspaper and placed pages of newspaper on the spilled water that customers have to  cross to get to the restrooms. No mop was ever used. The floor of The dining room was quite dirty, this is not typical of this location but I will give it another try if it's like this the next time I won't go back"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.  I had maybe the best salad I've ever had in my life (BBQ Chicken) here.  The prices, from what I could tell, were all under $15.00, it's in a nice, hip location of town and, as a bonus, it has the nicest hostess I've ever been associated with.  I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Their salads that are tossed to order are fantastic! . Saut√©ed mushrooms, slivered almonds, bacon, feta cheese, tomatoes, & carrots topped with honey mustard dressing is my go to order. My hub likes the awesome chicken Monterey sandwich with bacon. I've ordered the cranberry turkey sandwich & that is really good also. Their sandwich orders are huge portions. 
The \"crustini\" bread that comes on the salad is terrible & tastes like cardboard. They could improve it by: brushing it with Olive oil & sprinkling it with a little garlic salt & baking. Jasons deli does their garlic toast this way & it is really good."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here- it was the first time for both of us.  They have a variety of salads and sandwiches on the menu to choose from or you can even \"make you own\" salad from an assortment of fresh looking ingredients.  I went with the F.C. N.  (fruit, cheese. nut) salad. After seeing how large it is, we decided to split one! The salad was good, loved the ingredients! They serve the salad with a piece of bread, it was very hard so I am assuming it was suppose to serve as a large crouton...? 
When you walk in, you order at the front, pay, then they bring you your meal to a seat of you choice when it is ready- no waiter service here.  The staff was friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for a tasty salad."}
{"text":"It's great to see another Crisp location...this one tucked away in Dilworth next to Charlotte Running Company. 

If you like fresh salads and sandwiches, then you'll likely dig Crisp. The setup is similar to the 7th St spot..walk up to the pristine counter and place your order. The friendly employee will call out to have your choice of protein created while he/she fixes up your salad. The interior is low key and slick, albeit smaller than the other location. Regardless, the food comes out super quickly and, of course, freshly! 

I favor the Cobb salad as well as the Asian Shrimp salad. The Cobb is full of flavor and that dressing is to die for. While the Asian Shrimp salad is stuffed with plenty of fresh baby spinach, tasty grilled shrimp, Chinese noodles and such, the soy ginger dressing is pretty weak. 

Also, if you see brownies near the register...grab one! They are fan-freakin'-tastic."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh! I'm a big fan of Crisp.

A few girlfriends and I stopped by Crisp to enjoy a light dinner before heading to a show at Ovens. I'm so glad I did! The salads are generous, the ingredients are fresh and crisp and all of the protein is grilled while you wait. Inside, Crisp is cute, clean and well appointed for a quick bite or two. In case you haven't been here, you order from the very nice salad crafter, she asks the kitchen to grill the protein, you pay, you sit, they bring it out to you. So, it's not full waiter service but all the staff were really friendly and helpful with suggestions when I went. 

I ordered the Cobb Salad and it was indeed delicious. Fresh romaine, bits of bacon, Monterrey jack cheese (subbed for blue cheese), tomatoes, avocado and tasty grilled chicken. The salad was tossed with their house Dijon vinaigrette which was really, really amazing. I could probably drink that salad dressing. Well, not really, but it was great. 

My salad ran me $9 and it definitely filled me up and had some leftover. I'm really excited to go back and try a few other items at Crisp! 

*They also have wine available!"}
{"text":"The way I feel about salads is the same way I feel about sandwiches: they just taste so much better when someone else makes them. Am I right?!

Salad lovers, this is your mecca. Fresh ingredients. Long list of salads. Don't see one you like? No worries. You can build your own. And if you don't like that... well, there's really no one you can blame but yourself then. I usually go with salmon as my protein. I have to echo fellow Nikki W's comment... get it with pesto. (And yes, there are two Nikki W's. Watch out Charlotte)

Salads come with a crostini. I usually get a cup of soup with my salad so I can dunk this toasted crouton into it. My orders are usually enough to make two meals. Leftovers rule!

I go to yoga. For any of you that know me, you know I go a lot. After evening classes, I'm usually wiped out and a hot, sweaty mess. This place is so convenient to pop in and grab a salad or sandwich to go.

This location also has some pizzas on the menu. I haven't tried those yet. I can't bring myself to order a pizza at a salad place.

Only small problem is the parking situation in this area. Make sure you pay attention to where you are parking and obey all the signs. They do boot cars if you park in the wrong spot. You have been warned."}
{"text":"It's a walk-in, order and sit done until they bring you your food sort of place. Very pretty though. The parking in that area can be a bit of a headache though. I like that they have sodas and a few good beers to choose from. Great sandwich and large portion sizes when I went there. I think it seems like a nice place to relax and read or get work done in my Mac whilst having lunch."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food.  Extensive list of salads made-to-order; they grill the meat while you wait.  The monterey chicken sandwich and the steak sandwich are excellent.  Wait staff is friendly; ~$10 meal with a glass of tea.  Huge lunch rush.  They remember me and my order and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed both the salmon salad and the acropolis salad with shrimp. Both were really good and fresh. However, not too impressed when I went by today and saw the sanitation score! :-/"}
{"text":"A fresh, healthy salad from Crisp is just what the doctor ordered for those \"oh my God I've been eating cheesecake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a week\" moments.  Don't pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about...

Both locations are identical in taste and quality.  The service is super quick and friendly.  You can create your own salad with a choice of lettuce, protein, and 5 toppings.  Several of the salads that are on the menu I really enjoy.  The grilled salmon with pesto drizzle is outstanding.  I also enjoy the BBQ chicken salad if I'm feeling crazy.  I've never had any of the sandwiches or pizzas, but I can almost bet they are pretty great!  

The 7th Street location is more spacious but the food in my opinion is the same!"}
{"text":"Loving a Crisp location in Dilworth!  I've already been twice, and loved each visit- great fresh ingredients for my 'build my own' salad, and the Chicken Bruschetta wrap was DELISH!  Its a great option for a quick and healthy lunch/dinner option, and the portions are large- one salad feeds me a dinner and lunch the next day!
Friendly service, clean and a great location.  I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of salads but I love crisp!  I tried the steak salad soo good!!  I've also tried their chicken bbq salad also very good.  I don't recommend their tomato basil soup..not very good."}
{"text":"I had an unpleasant experience with a pick-up order.  The order included 2 items. The person who picked up the order was only given 1 item. When I called I was told the other item was still at the restaurant (Information which was useless as I work 25 minutes from the location). His explanation was that the person who picked up the order asked for \" AN order\" which they interpreted as ONE item. I was never offered an apology.

I understand mistakes happen all the time, however an apology for a hungry person with a limited lunch period goes a long way. I suggest they train your employees to offer better customer service and make changes to their online ordering service so their customers aren't deprived of their meals."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I love the vibe of the staff, the decor of the restaurant and all of their delicious salads! Everyone in Charlotte should be a fan of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was a mess.... as in no one seemed to have any clue what they were doing. Seriously I think all the employees were high. The employee running the salad line looked absolutely miserable and when she was finished with a metal bowl she would drop it on the ground loudly into a tub. She wasn't directly rude but her body language said everything. My salad was a nice big portion and tasted great but I waited a pretty long time for it. It creeped me out a bit that my salad in an uncovered bowl was handled by at least 4 different people and then left out to sit in the open for about 10 minutes at a bustling bar... while I waited and tried to tell the bartender it was mine. I would eat here again for takeout but wouldn't dine in again."}
{"text":"Salad lovers unite! And head to Crisp! This eatery is absolutely amazing is you're looking for a leafy lunch. 

You really can't go wrong with a place that lets you choose your own ingredients and have the chefs build the salad in front of you - this is typically the way I go, adding nuts, blue cheese crumbles, avocados and lots more. You top it with your choice of protein, which I usually just go chicken or salmon. Extra tip, have them do the protein with pesto - brings the flavor to another level! And your salad comes with a cheesy crostana... mmmmm.... 

If you are feeling lazy, they have a pre-fix menu as well - just decide which of the salads they have listed and they will whip it up for you. 

The beverage and side choices are minimal but the salads are entree sized so I typically just go when I am looking for a healthy, tasty salad. The Caesar dressing is top notch, smooth and creamy, and the lemon vinaigrette is also a delicious choice if you are looking for something lighter but still with a zest of flavor."}
{"text":"As a self-declared salad aficionado, I was pretty excited when we decided to go Crisp for lunch.  However the experience and salads were slightly underwhelming.  The menu options were good and the restaurant very clean (which is a plus since they make the salads right on the spot in front of you).  The ingredients looked fresh and the portions huge.  Yet anything else worth mentioning stops there.  

I picked the create your own salad, which allows you to pick the norm: green type, protein type, and then a variety of different ingredients and dressing.  The particular guy making mine didn't exactly look thrilled to be there.  While I'm not expecting a song, dance, and 1000 watt smile...pleasantries are always nice in terms of food preparation and service.  I asked for a recommendation on one of the vinaigrettes (they have a ton...which is a plus) and he very apathetically remarked he did not know which one he liked the best because there were like 12.  A huge deal breaker? No. Something a new patron wants to hear from a place specializing in salads? Not really.  They also provided lemonade, unsweetened tea, and sweet tea in self-service containers.  It looked really pretty but tasted pretty generic. 

We sat outside on the patio because of how nice it was outside and the set-up really is lovely.  Great seating options and good for people watching.  While I would not make a concerted effort to avoid Crisp, there's nothing remarkable that stood out to separate it from some of the other great spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's hard to do salads right in a restaurant.  Crisp understands salads and the importance of fresh ingredients.  I wanted to give 3 1/2 stars and with a few tweaks, they could make it to within striking distance of 4 stars.

My daughter and her husband took my wife and I to Crisp for lunch, so I got to check out 4 different menu items. Service was fast and the food was delivered with a smile. Only one small mix-up but not even worth mentioning here.

I had the cobb salad and it was OK. The chicken breast on top was hot and literally steaming. Very moist but not much flavor going on. A lightly seasoned boneless/skinless chicken breast doesn't bring much to the party, but it was cooked well. Lettuce was crisp and fresh and the blue cheese was very good.  The bacon was too thick and kind of hard to eat. not crisp and tender at all.

The wife had the marinated shrimp salad, and it was to me, the best thing on the table. Asian dressing was fantastic, the shrimp were flavorful and perfectly cooked. Lots of spinach, almonds, crispy noodles, red peppers and Asian pear slices.

My Daughter had the flank steak sandwich. While the bread was good and the steak was very flavorful the sandwich was lacking a certain \"zing\"  The steak was a little tough.  I know that flank steak can be tough but the way you slice it makes a lot of difference.

Son-in-Law had the BLT wrap and pasta salad. It looked great, stuffed full of bacon, lettuce and bright red tomatoes. He said it was really good, and I would probably consider trying it in the future.

The space was just OK, nothing special and it got a little crowded. The drink area is right beside where you pay and I bumped into two people getting drinks.  I would like it if they had organic options or used ingredients from local farms.

All in all Crisp is a welcome fresh alternative to most fast food lunch options and it is refreshing to have a restaurant salad at an establishment that understands how to make one."}
{"text":"Crisp is solid. My issue with paying $10 for a salad is it is something that I can make at home with fresh produce for half the price. But, something always seems a bit more delicious when someone else makes it for you, am I right?

I have been to the Elizabeth location a couple times for carry out, this was my first trip to the Dilworth location. It was packed with the lunch rush, but the line moved pretty quickly and we were able to cram into a table to eat lunch. I do like the build your own option, but I do agree with previous reviewers that the toppings are pretty standard and nothing out of the ordinary. They generally seem fresh (except a funky taste to my apple slices today). I got the flank steak on top, which was cooked to the temperature I ordered (hooray!). So I do like that the meat is not pre cooked and it is something that they do when you ask for it.

I also like the portion, it is HUGE and I get at least 2 servings (if not three if I'm taking the side salad approach) so that is sometimes how I can justify a $10. 

Not a place that I will go to all the time, but definitely a reliable stand by when I crave a salad and am too lazy to make it myself."}
{"text":"I visited Crisp mostly when they were on 7th St.  I have been to the new location twice now and it is completely different...in a good way.

The old place was always overly crowded with long waits and employees that were hit or miss.  A few being very nice, while others, not so much.  The new place seems to have new employees who are always very courteous and helpful.

It hasn't been very crowded and my order is prepared in less time than normal.  I like the salads and try different combos every now & then.  My favorite dressing is the honey mustard vinaigrette.  It is on the sweet side, but great!!!  The bacon is delicious and always crispy."}
{"text":"Very pricey for salad.  Mostly always good if you make your own and don't let them put the salad dressing on because they will drown it!!! They have special daily salads which are just ridiculously priced! I would rather go somewhere else and spend my money to get a more fulfilling meal. The staff is ok, a little lazy. They weren't too personable."}
{"text":"I live three blocks from here, and just finally got Crisped a couple of weeks back. Something weird was keeping me away, like I needed to get highlights first, or was it a fear that mediocrity from the next door Crapbucks was going to creep in and make my salad meh? Who knows. /end snark

So yes, you can eat here, well, my vegan loves. Duh, I know, salad place, but ya - the tofu is a little freaky, fried then grilled, char lines so black you'd swear they were Sharpie, but at least its here. Super fresh greens and sharply flavored dressings, of which there are several cheese-free options. Staff is on top of table clearing and salad tossing (heh) so the pace here is less comfy, more salad factory. Gets crowded. 9 dolla salad. Kinda pricey, but I left full and satisfied.

I think I even saw a vegan soup on ze blackboard - wootwoot."}
{"text":"While the food was not bad, the service was very slow and disorganized. Two out of three of us received our food and finished eating before our third even got her food. When I went to ask about her meal, the staff was unapologetic and unbothered by their mistake. Poor customer service and terrible timing skills. It was a slow day and they couldn't get it right. I'd hate to see them on a busy Saturday."}
{"text":"Crisp is a solid place to get a very healthy salad.

In the world of heavy meat and greasy diets, I can see myself hitting this place a couple times a week. I can't always working out as much as I like to but I know I can at least eat healthy!

It is a huge portion but it is very good for what it is. The shop is  a bit small but they do very well for the space they have. 

I would make sure you know what you want BEFORE You get in line otherwise you might get passed by. I understand since this is a pretty popular place.

This place is dog friendly"}
{"text":"Love! Super awesome place to grab a quick meal and it's not super heavy or unhealthy like other places. Got the salmon salad and it was great for the price! Usually salmon dishes are at least $12+. All salads also come with a crostini and lots of different options for everyone. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something fresh and delicious in Charlotte, you have to check out Crisp. This location is hidden away in a shopping plaza off of East Blvd  in Dilworth, but if you're in the area it's worth the find. They make the salad in front of you and there are plenty of options. The grilled chicken is phenomenal. All the staff is super friendly too. Did I mention they serve wine? You really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out with some of the ladies from work for lunch a few days ago. Their packaging method leaves much to be desired. When you put a hot sandwich in the same paper box with a cold salad and the only thing that separates them is some packing paper, it basically jacks up both items. My salad was warm and the sandwich was soggy. I could see the grill marks on the bread, but it was just mush.

I could taste that the flavors themselves were not bad, but I couldn't finish the meal. I'm sure I'll go in to try it onsite, but I'll definitely skip ordering to-go from here again unless I only get food of one temperature."}
{"text":"Great salads for any time of day. Fresh ingredients and good selection of protein. Solid place to eat."}
{"text":"To start, my salad was great! I thought the food was really good and there were a lot of options to choose from.

The reason for my 3 star is the atmosphere. I'm not sure if it was an \"off\" day, but the person in the kitchen was slamming metal bowls and tossing them on to the counter or in the sink, making it extremely hard to enjoy my lunch with my friend. She was sitting right in front of me and I couldn't even hear her. In fact, I left there with a headache. I totally understand normal kitchen noise, but this was more than that. Many of the customers in the restaurant were visibly annoyed by the lack of consideration by the person in the kitchen. 

I'll probably wait to return for another salad when its not too hot to sit outside."}
{"text":"The food is great. The manager is awful. Worst experience because of him. Wouldn't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Caesar salad with grilled chicken is amazing. My favorite spot for a salad in the city. I added bacon and corn and it was a great decision! My weekly salad spot!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today after finding out was voted best sandwiches in Charlotte. I had a BLT and my friend a Reuben. Both were good but nothing outstanding-a bit disappointed. Must say the pasta was very good and huge portion. Very small dining area so as lunch crowd got there became very loud and almost had to shout to be heard."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day which was the southwest chicken wrap...all in all it was just an average wrap, not bad but not great. I got a side of pasta salad, it was mushy and bland..at least the portions were large."}
{"text":"This is not your average make your own salad place - Crisp is one of my favorite go-to spots for a quick, delicious and healthy lunch. They have a great variety of salad toppings and different types of protein. I interchange between the salmon, grilled tofu, or tilapia (when they have it - YUMMY). I usually make my own salad and try different veggies all the time. They have a great array of dressings too - I like the light balsamic and the sherry shallot vinaigrette. I have been meaning to come for dinner because I know they sell beer and wine too which is definitely a plus. They also sell soup and sandwiches and I think even maybe flat breads? Not sure since I don't really eat bread. But I do really love this place and come here at least once per week!"}
{"text":"I have to bring some balance to this place that is HIGHLY overrated!!!  C'mon folks!!  Ok, ok...I will cut everyone some slack.  I think this is one of the only \"create your own salad\" places in Charlotte so the idea seems fresh and new and exciting and I have to believe emotions are running high.

I absolutely love the concept of Crisp and when done right you can create a salad masterpiece.  I just don't think Crisp is \"all that.\"  They had some decent toppings to add to your salad but most of them didn't look very fresh and the variety wasn't that great!

The part that truly marked my rating down was the chicken that I added to the top of my salad.  They don't have it pre-prepared so if you order chicken there is a cook standing by waiting to grill it or do whatever to it.  They pulled this breast of chicken out of some random plastic bucket and started to grill it right away and then slapped it on top of my salad.  It wasn't marinated, it wasn't cooked through, it was absolutely disgusting.  It didn't even have a hint of salt on it and it was rubbery.  I mean, it ruined my otherwise decent salad.

I didn't think the teeny boppers working there were very friendly and I'm sure I wasn't when I used to work in food service at that age but it still took something away from the experience.  They were like pushing each other and laughing at who was going to get \"stuck\" making the salad because none of them wanted to do anything....ahh the youth of today....but that's a whole other story.

All in all, Crisp is a great idea and has some great menu items...I would avoid their chicken like the plague unless you tell them to drench it in flavor somehow and I personally wouldn't go out of my way to return.  Clearly, that's just me though.  :)"}
{"text":"just delicious, but holy portion size!

my sister and I made our own salads, and I think we only got to see parts of the bottom of our bowl because we sat forever talking and continuing to nibble on it. super fresh ingredients, speedy service, and the dressings do not disappoint.  

parking can be a little annoying during peak lunch hours, and it can get a little crowded - especially if you come right in the middle of an odd rush and they only have one person making salads, but once you get into your seat it's all good. 

daily soups and specials, just a nice place (with a patio!) to enjoy lunch."}
{"text":"Crisp has had the right idea for a while - crisp (for lack of a better word) greens, fresh vegetables and other salad yummies, cooked to order proteins, and a selection of dressings you wish you had in your fridge. Want to pick out exactly what goes on your salad? No problem. Feeling less creative but still want something super tasty? Choose from the awesome menu. So opening a second location would seem kind of a no-brainer. (And thanks for putting it a stone's throw away from my house in the Outback strip... a few doors down from Thai Thai)

if you've been to the Elizabeth location think slightly smaller seating area, same earth tones inside, same menu, larger parking lot, no bar seating, no cute patio, and not as good people watching (it's kind of at an odd part of the strip).  If you've never been to Crisp, you're in for huge salad portions, some soup and sandwich options, and a fairly casual environment where you can eat and go fairly quickly or take your time and maybe eventually get to the bottom of your salad bowl. 

I enjoy the atmosphere of the other Crisp more, it's a little bit more bustling, a little less sterile feeling - but this location still cranks out tasty salads and I see myself stopping in again in the near future. The only note is I don't think the employees have figured out the acoustics of the place just yet, although there were about four tables eating and conversing it all seemed to be drowned out by gossip and \"omg\"s &\"totally\"s coming from behind the counter and beyond. 

Also, they update daily specials through their facebook https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Crisp-Charlotte/132401990164787"}
{"text":"I liked the food, however the manager or owner always parks their van beside the building and makes a hard parking lot to get through even tougher.  If they cut corners parking where else are they cutting corners?"}
{"text":"I always build my own salad. Everything is usually fresh but the last time I went there was some brown lettuce. I always order the salmon with pesto on my salad and their lemonade/tea mix is solo good.  I just wish the parking situation was better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the BLT with turkey. A large sandwich with amazingly cooked bacon & a great aioli, which added a special flavor to the sandwich. I chose the pasta salad as my side and it was god, not great. The location is great, but the inside is a little dark & quiet for my liking, but the service was nice."}
{"text":"Great big salads - make your own or choose from a list.  Made right in front of you and if you add meat, I think they grill it while you are waiting.  Very fresh!
Now with their wine selection, and the way they dim the lights and place candles on the table - it makes it a great dinner/date place.
The staff/service is very friendly, too."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this Crisp location for a couple of years. Consistent, delicious food. Plenty of salad choices. LOVE the Honey Dijon dressing. I am always a bit disappointed that the price is a couple of dollars higher than one would expect (or maybe give a couple more toppings for the money?). But the atmosphere is quiet, efficient, and calming. A great stop for a good, quick salad/lunch and to decompress before heading back to the grind."}
{"text":"Ordered food from door dash, I asked the girl at the restaurant if they pasta salad had nuts that my husband has a severe nut allergy. Moments after he ate it, he had an allergic reaction. Employees need to know what is in there food! Allergic reactions are serious!"}
{"text":"When ordering the person was very quick with my six year old granddaughter and it was our first time there. All the fixins were under the salad and you could barely turn over the lettuce to get to them. Portions are big, counter and wait staff were great. Mixed feelings about this place, probably not my first stop when looking at choices to make."}
{"text":"I got my order to go. My veggie pie was ready when I arrived. The price was very reasonable. The place was clean, had a fresh and trendy appearance, and outside seating if desired.

I came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! I thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base. So basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus. All of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly. 

Service was bland... Not rude...But never smiled. 

Regardless, I give this place a thumbs up because it offers real vegan pizza!"}
{"text":"What I love about Crisp is that the staff is pleasant and helpful every time I visit.  What is even better about this restaurant concept is that you get the type of salad you want with the items you prefer.  This makes for a pretty big salad that tastes just the way you like it!  This is exactly what I get when I visit and I love that I can experiment with different fixins'.  The process is, select a green, select a protein (chicken, shrimp, tofu...), select 5 toppings, then select your dressing.  You can't miss because it is what you make it!  They have a nice, but small selection of wine and beer is also available.  On my last visit, we enjoyed the Sangria.  We got a decanter full for $10 and it was plenty!  In addition to the good food, Crisp is typically not crowded if we go in the early evening, so there's no wait to fill your crying \"feed me\" stomach!"}
{"text":"The pizza is made to order and is quite tasty and filling.  My fav is the chicken pesto that always hits the spot.  The salads, well, when you pick your own ingredients, there is nothing to complain about!  My daughter said the BLT was the best she ever had and she eats a lot of them.  

Crisp service is fast and the staff members are always attentive.  If it is an evening meal, you can add wine or beer.  Weekends offers white or red Sangria, which we enjoyed tremendously.  Crisp is a great spot for a quick bite to eat and there's usually minimal wait time.  I say, when  you're hungry, go eat!"}
{"text":"Always know me by name. Ingredients are fresh. Customer service is phenomenal! Best place in Charlotte to get a salad!"}
{"text":"You can always say there is something a restaurant can improve on, such as the noise level.  However it is clean.  Even during lunch they are quick. The food comes out quickly whether it's for dine in or to go. I have enjoyed the wraps, salads, and soups. When I come into town from Florida I try to make it in.  
What more can you ask for?  
Oh!  The prices are in par with quality as well."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a made to order option for salads available. They are pricey but the salads are HUGE. Meats are nice and freshly made though I wish they had the option for a half size."}
{"text":"the food was really really good. I had the Cobb salad. But the lady making my salad was rude. But the lady at the register went over and beyond."}
{"text":"So after a long morning of studying I decided to venture out to grab a salad and a glass of vino... yes wine for lunch... gotta problem with that. 

Any who - trekked across town to Crisp. I love my exploring... I love all the new neighborhoods I get to travel too. 

So I make it to Elizabeth and there on the corner sits Crisp. I love how inviting it is from the street. Outside seating and other goodies next store. You're able to enjoy your lunch and then walk about. 

I ordered the steak salad... medium rare, extra grilled red onions, grilled mushrooms, romaine lettuce and another green mix, tomatoes and holy jersey cow... I should have watched the cheese being thrown down! Since cheesethere was nothing fried on my plate, they make up in the  drowning of bleu cheese!!! For sure next time I will ask for my cheese on the side as always with my dressing.

I truly loved my salad. The steak was cooked to perfection (med/rare as asked) and seasoned delightfully. I would have finished my salad except for the block of bleu cheese I left behind. I balsamic was really lovely. I use the fork dip then stab lettuce technique, so it's really refreshing to have salad dressing explode with flavor on your palate. 

The overall ambiance is quite lovely. I liked the small bar and it's selection. I forget the chardonnay I had, but it was quite buttery with hints of sweet berry. I also loved they have individual pepper-mills on each table... freshly ground pepper really makes any meal - too bad they didn't offer a salt-mill as well.... but 1 out of 2 is superb.

Oh... you can use the wi-fi from Starbucks... hehehe I sneaked on to it. 

I plan on coming back and will bring the parental units should they behave. 

Thanks Crisp for a lovely salad and the lovely service! Everyone was so kind and helpful to this lost Cali gal.

And yes, they accept AMEX!!!! I will get my rewards soon enough for that trip I want damn it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a five star for service because both workers that helped us out were extremely friendly and helpful. 

Price-$9 for a salad seems pricey, so be sure to load up on all five toppings.

Salads- I do not recommend getting any of the cold cut salads as the chicken was much more tasty and fresh than the turkey salad my wife got. I also recommend the Asian-Ginger Vinaigrette since it was an explosion of flavor for my tastebuds. 

Would definitely visit here again for lunch as opposed to the Crisp on 7th street due to the overly friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD!! Delicious, hand-crafted, cooked to order & perfection! 

This place is quite amazing. They have every kind of topping and combination of salad you could think of - as well as creating your own if you don't see something you like on their board. 

A little on the spendy side if you're looking for a regular salad, but these are more gourmet salads - not a subway salad.

The service is very quick and friendly, you walk in and head to the counter - watch them put everything together - cook, chop & toss it all the way you want! 

*Best tip about this place - the size of one salad can really feed 2 people - or take home the other half for another meal : )"}
{"text":"Great quick salad spot. Similar to sweet greens in DC or NYC. Fresh grilled steak and other ingredients make the spot awesome. This is my go to lunch spot for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"The Acropolis used to be my go to salad in Charlotte. The past two times I've gotten it (Latta Arcade and Elizabeth), the quality of the ingredients has heavily deteriorated. The olives have gone from kalamata olives to canned black olives. The shrimp was chewy and over salted. The lettuce was wilted and poorly chopped. 

The first time I assumed was just the new location and heavy lunch rush. The Elizabeth experience makes me think they've changed vendors or owners. Really disappointing and wouldn't recommend to others."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place.  With all the fast food and greasy food options around, its nice to have this kind of place.  Chopt is right down the road, but for the money, Crisp is the best.  I like the create your own.  Pick your greens, protein and 5 toppings.  Cant go wrong with spinach and blacken chicken.  Go wild on the toppings."}
{"text":"Their Greek salad is seriously out of Thai world! One of the best I've ever had. 

We typical do to-go orders and they are always ready fairly quickly. 

I haven't eaten in yet but I want to soon and try their wine menu"}
{"text":"I rarely walk away from a meal feeling full.  Not only am I full and satisfied after dining at Crisp, I feel that way after eating a salad!  They have a great fresh salad bar, with lots of great fillers available like chick peas, hard boiled eggs, and a variety of cheeses and hearty vegetables.  Additionally, they offer really generous portions of quality protein including salmon and steak.  I am a big eater and even I have to push \"through the wall\" to finish my Crisp salads.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times and the food is always great. I'm picky about salads because I hate low quality proteins(think airport chicken salads) and the protein here is always fresh and warm! I havent had the issues other reviewers have because I always do a custom salad order, so I cant speak on messed up orders. I moved to south park recently and after having crappy salads at Chopt ive started driving back to Dilworth to get Crisp."}
{"text":"I love Crisp! Always friendly + welcoming staff to fresh tasty food! I have custom made a salad, had the BBQ salad to getting a panini last time. Their sides are delicious and my kids meal was healthy and delicious as well. Always large portions so I take the rest home. Their salmon and pasta salad are amazing but really this is a restaurant where you can't go wrong with anything you order."}
