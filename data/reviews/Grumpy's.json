{"text":"What a refreshing approach. Old style customer service - you are greeted like an old friend every time you come in.   Prices are reasonable and the donuts are fantastic. You can even create your own donut toppings. While some of them are unconventional to say the least (like fruity pebbles cereal) you wont be sorry you got adventurous and tried it.   Hot dogs are good quality and pretty much your standard hot dog shop expected. I wouldnt hesitate to stop there for lunch any day of the week."}

{"text":"Grumpy's Donuts, Dogs and Fries.    Create your own donut sounds interesting.  Many toppings for create your own including Jimmies, Chocolate chips, Peanut Butter Cup, Vanilla Wafers, Cocoa Pebbles, Banana...and more.  3 types of dogs: regular, monster 1/4 pound and natural casing.  Also many styles: naked dog, and the usual condiments including chili, cheese, as well as, a half dozen Specialty Dogs.    Ordered the Buffalo Dog with onions, pepper rings, Buffalo Sauce and Jalapenos.  A typical dog with good condiments.  Had the fries with which looked to be fresh cut and were tasty.  Prices are low, so if you want a dog or to create your own donut this is a nice quick stop."}
