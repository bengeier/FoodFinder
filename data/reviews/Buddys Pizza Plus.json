{"text":"Took my kids, and my sons friend to Buddy's for dinner tonight. The staff was so helpful as I couldn't decide what to order! :) There is so much to choose from! Finally I decided on 2 lg pizzas and an order of bbq wings. The food came out pretty fast. I've had buddy's before (pick up and delivery) and it has ALWAYS been good. Today, was even better though! Maybe because we ate it there? ;) We will definitely  be back! It's worth the drive from Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Was a little unsure about trying Buddy's pizza plus I am happy I did though not only do they have great pizza and their tuna pita was delicious, but they also have a reasonably priced kids menu which is great for my picky 4 year old who loves something one minute then changes her mind the next.  We also enjoyed the  Atmosphere of buddy's and all  the old character pictures . This is  Definitely one of my new favorite places to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Food is not great and very over priced for the quality.. place is run by kids.. we had the Greek fries and they were nasty with salad dressing and the cheesesteak was over priced."}
{"text":"Toppings and sauce are great!!   But they wouldn't know a New York style crust if it slapped them in the face and called them daddy!  Crust was way too thick and doughy.  Close, but we have given you guys 4 chances....time to find a new pizza buddy. Sorry guys....get it together!"}
{"text":"I had a flyer for Buddys put on my door so I thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered two hot sandwiches online which was super easy and convienent. That order was placed at 141pm with and eta on delivery of 45 min.  After an hour I called and the guy that answered the phone assured me that it had already left and would be to me in 15 minutes.   After 25 more minutes I called again and the girl that answered said it was out and will be to me shortly and the driver had multiple deliveries. At 206 My sandwiches arrived. Two sandwiches an hour and 31  Min. I live two miles away from Buddy's.  Two hot sandwiches both showed up cold and I had to reheat before I could even eat.  Sandwiches were pretty good and big for sure.   But if you want to try it, don't order delivery."}
{"text":"Really surprised and impressed. Great specials, and great food. Got pizza for the kids and oven baked sandwiches for the lady and I.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and we love it! The food is really good and really inexpensive! We have ordered a regular 14 inch pizza and the ceaser salad, both were very good! The employees are also very nice! Kailey z. helped us and she was very nice! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"awful. burnt greasy pizza. horrible flavor. overpriced. NEVER. AGAIN. I hate to say it, would rather go down the street and get a $5 Little Caesars..."}
{"text":"First time visiting Buddy's. I would definitely recommend the wings! Very good and tasty."}
{"text":"I had ordered from them four or five times previously, always delivered. Good experiences every time. Now they never pick up the phone, it just rings and rings, for a very long time. Did they go out of business? A shame, because they had menu items my other delivery place didn't."}
