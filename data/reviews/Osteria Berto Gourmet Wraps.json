{"text":"Great wraps with a some quality toppings. No processed food here. Very fresh. Extremely tasty. Nice cappuccino tops it off nicely. Gets busy from 12-1 so give yourself a little extra time because you could be waiting a little longer then what's considered average."}
{"text":"The food is overrated and overpriced. Can't comment on the service or wait time since I went close to when it opened and was the 2nd customer there."}
{"text":"If you can get over the rude, arrogant and disrespectful attitude of Lisa and the chef, the food is quite good.  Customer service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. They are great with whomever they deem \"regulars\", however anybody else is treated awful.  Food is excellent, above mentioned staff are a whole new level of terrible.  Thanks- Frank"}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for one wrap! This is crazy! Other reviews are right! I should've been to McDonalds for faster service."}
{"text":"Where to begin - after several visits, it is very clear that the customer service here is beyond horrible!  Arrived at 11:30 am and door was locked. I called and was abruptly advised that the doors were not being opened until noon OR when they had dealt with all the telephone orders????  Saw people entering the side door to pick up orders so went in and asked if I could wait indoors. The chef said \"I guess I don't have a choice\".  I sat at one of the four tables to wait for my friends and he then rudely put reserved signs on all the tables!  If they don't want customers, they should just close down.  I left without ordering and needless to say, I will never go back. If take out is there thing, then that's all they should do and forget the dine in option. Those customers matter too!!!!"}
{"text":"First off, if you want to visit the restaurant on a Saturday and order on the spot, expect to get some stares and huffs by the owner. He suggests to call then pick up instead. Not sure why but okay!!   Now on with the food. I will overlook the lack of service because the food is amazing. Their strength is the wraps and the rice balls. The rice ball is not so much as a \"ball\" than a football. Its huge! And so delicious. The outer crust is crispy and reveals morsels of rice and cheese. Plenty of homemade marinara sauce which was excellent. Overall good value.   The wraps come in 2 or 4 towers based on length of wrap. I had the steak tower and it was loaded with juicy tender beef strips (they say it is angus beef) and lots of rapini and other veggies. They really stuff the wrap to the max.    Overall the price can be a little steep but once you realize how much food you are getting and the quality it is totally worth it. There aren't many restaurant options in the area that isn't franchised so come here for lunch."}
{"text":"It's good when you take a few days to think about a review before writing it. Had I written this review on the day I grabbed food here, I was still so hangry still about my wait time that I couldn't accept the fact that this is a VERY popular spot for lunch. The line up of patrons, not the speed of the staff was responsible for the wait times.   So heed my warning, get there early at lunch and don't come totally famished if you arrive during prime time - you will have to wait about 20 minutes (and that can be torture).  I was on the run the day I visited so I needed to get in and out. While the wait time was low I did find the woman working the cash to not exactly be helpful in her recommendations when I asked what was good? She said \"it's all good, we serve wraps.\" Yes I understood that, and yes your menu only had 3 options for wraps (steak chicken and other) but I had hoped for just a slight direction as to what was good for my first time - not helpful.  I learned after asking other patrons what the options were, and I learned that you could get any of the aforementioned wraps in either a 2 tower (8 inch) or a 3 tower (12 inch) option. Tower simply reflects how they present the wraps (standing up) when served. I went with a 3 tower steak to go, no sides.   I'm able to give them a 4 star because despite the wait times and uninterested service the steak wrap was sublime. Filled with a mix of grilled veggies that were done expertly in oils and garlic, not wilted and still will a little pop when you bite into them. I didn't even care as the steak juices and hot oils escaped the wrap and slid down my hands while I ate - it was so F%$%in good. Finger licking good, if you will!  Bet your ass I'll be back, early, with an order in mind. Heck I might even have that salad that everyone seemed to be enjoying!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I normally don't go for wraps because of the whole wheat intolerance issue. However, this was well worth it. My friend and I shared a 2 tower steak wrap with goat cheese, and a 2 tower baked sea bass wrap. They were both delicious. All of the ingredients were fresh and complemented the main protein in the wrap. The chef even went so far as to explain why they were leaving out a couple of the usual accompaniments with the sea bass, which I really appreciated.  The staff clearly enjoyed being there and working with each other. I highly recommend stopping in for a great wrap that is well worth the price."}
{"text":"Very good wraps. Not fast food gotta wait as its grilled  up fresh. Steak wrap with goat cheese is tops.  Add a little hot oil to really spice it up. Pricey but worthwhile. Fave...2 tower steak with salad"}
{"text":"Similar to what other reviewers have said, there is quite a wait time at this place. I went for a late lunch at 1 and waited 15 min for a 2 tower grilled chicken wrap (8 inches). While the price was about $11, I expected it to be amazing but it wasn't anything special. There wasn't enough flavour. Maybe if I added feta cheese or another topping, it would've tasted better.   The woman taking orders wasn't very friendly. But the gentleman who made my wrap was very nice.  It was nice to try once but next time I'm in a sandwich or wrap mood, I would go to Subway, Exteme Pita, or some place else where you can find a cheaper price for tastier food."}
{"text":"The wait is too long for pricey mediocre food. I would have rather gone to the shawarma place beside it, and I hate shawarma.  The place seems to try to hard to be classy and the ordering system seems confusing and disorderly. The service was terrible yet they play it off as it should be the norm by being friendly. When I finally got my steak wrap, the food was lukewarm and it tasted soggy and unappetizing. It was $13 bucks (not including drink) and I got a small wrap cut in half standing up like two towers on a plate.  I would never come back here because it took way too long for my food to come out. I waited 1 hour for my food and had to extend my lunch hour to 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"Gourmet wraps! Awesome! Steak wrap is my favourite. The hot sauce is also very good, it's home made, be prepared to wait a little at lunch time it gets packed in there. This isn't your average wrap place, there is an actual chef here cooking for you. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Amazing Wraps. Steak was excellent. Salad was done well. Will be back. Place is clean. Staff is great."}
{"text":"This rating is for the food itself and not the wait, the prices, the lack of seating or any other inconvenience. If the review were based on all of that, I would give it a 4. The staff will not shower you with love. They are too busy preparing and delivering great food.  To call the product that Osterio Berto sells a \"wrap\" is doing it an injustice. It's called a wrap because the ingredients are held together in a tortilla. But it's unlike any wrap you've had before. The location is on the North West quadrant of Highway 7 and 27, is easy to get to and there's lots of parking.  The main choices of steak or chicken are available as a 2 Tower (8\") or a 3 Tower (12\") and can be accompanied with a salad, which is also excellent! The \"Tower\" description relates to the way the wrap is served (i.e. cut into 3 pieces and placed standing in the dish as \"towers\"). The ingredients are simple and fresh and it all just works together beautifully.  The only downside of this place is its popularity and the fact that great food is not fast food. At lunch time it may be hard to find a seat and the wait will be about 20 minutes (based on my one visit), however the end result is worth the wait. The prices are very reasonable however a 3 tower wrap will cost about $15.00 with taxes.  Next time I will go after the lunch rush and take my time with the wrap and hopefully have time to finish it off with a nice coffee and a desert.  Great place and hope they open one in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The food may be decent, but from what we saw we didn't even get to taste it because we were waiting OVER A HALF HOUR for some wraps. 3 wraps, two small salads, and 3 pops were $48! After waiting for so long and being promised over and over that the food would be ready (when there were only 7 people ahead of us with small orders) we were told \"McDonald's is faster maybe you should go there\"! Great! Way to go antagonizing your customers who are willing to pay $48 for food that would cost $15 from any gyro or shawarma place. Oh yeah, and it would have been ready in 5min.   These people are \"friendly\" until you call them out on their ridiculousness. Seriously, McDonald's would have been better. At least you know what to expect.  If you don't have a job and no place to go, for hours on end, and are willing to wait for pricey mediocre food this place is great."}
{"text":"W-O-W. I have only eaten here once - but it was magical. I wish more people knew about them but they don't seem to have a web presence. Let's see if we can change that!  They don't have a huge menu here, but that is no matter because what they do make, they make extremely well. I had their steak wrap (comes with asparagus, mushrooms, zucchini and goat cheese...I think?) and it was cooked to perfection. I had to force myself to chew 20 times with each bite just to make it last longer. The steak didn't have any weird gristle and was a quality cut, the wrap was not an overbearing flavour sucker either. It was absolutely worth the money. I'm thankful that I work close by so that I can come here more often!"}
{"text":"It's a gourmet wrap... and I know that therefore I will wait for these delicious wraps unlike the few comments before...and agree if you don't want to wait go to McDonalds.    I have been here a few times (sometimes with my kids) and enjoy everything about it."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Got there at 11:30am with a friend of mine and the doors were closed. Called and the woman answered and said, we are here however we are not opening our doors until we complete all our phone orders! Waited outside for 15 mins until she finally opened the doors. Apparently she felt bad we were waiting outside on a HOT Summer's day. While inside we waited another 15 mins before we could place our order. Placed our order for 2 wraps. While we waited for our food we noticed that a family of four who placed their order way after us received their food before us!! Must have been friends of the Chef! Wraps were delicious however it wasn't worth the hour long wait. Customer service was horrendous! Such attitude and bad body language from the woman taking orders. I suggest if you want to eat here, place your order over the phone for pick up. Apparently they cater more to call in customers than customers who actually dine in."}
