{"text":"Had to write this review before we head home. Went here last night and had the best dinner of our whole trip. Small, intimate, grotto like atmosphere with warm downtempo music and soft pillows around the edge of laid back benches.

This is truly an enoteca, which means it is heavily influenced by wine and has small plates. Beautiful glass wine cellar to boot! 

So, on to the experience. The people running the place are younger and very passionate about what they serve and sell. Our waiter was the most friendly and helpful, passionate person about the wines and foods they had to offer. I told him I wanted a barbera or Barolo as we wanted a change of pace from brunello and chianti. He steered us to the best bottle we had all trip. A 2003 barbera d'asti that was amazing! 32 euros to boot.

He recommended the meat and cheese for two. It was enough for 4. We split a local dish of pasta that had potatoes and cabbage. Believe its called pizzocheri. Again, amazing! Finished with homemade chocolate tort and serious espresso, we were in heaven.

Going back tonight as it was that good."}
{"text":"Great spot to relax and have some great cocktails and wine. Tried their Tuscan wine flight and it was very good. Nice and friendly staff and they are accommodating for English speakers. Highly recommended spot for grabbing some drinks."}
{"text":"This place was chic and homey. The staff was tremendous! We did a tasting and it was honestly the most informative tasting I've ever had. And this is coming from someone who lives near the California wine regions. Just loved our experience here!"}
{"text":"Upon first glance you think this is just a wine bar/store, which it is, but go in and have a seat for a fresh simple menu that pairs well with the assortment of Italian regional wines this store carries. 

Oh my trip to Rome, Milan and Lake Como, I must say Aperitivo Et al managed to make the most flavourful lasagna. Fresh tomato sauce with slow cooked meat nestled between soft layers of tender pasta and ricotta cheese. This was so light, almost airy, I could have ate 2.  A must try- you don't even have to be hungry to get this- make a good snack!"}
{"text":"This was a nice wine bar that made a good stop for lunch. We tried a few different wines. I was impressed that when we asked our waiter for recommendations, he chose moderately prices wine. We shared some salume, cheeses, salad and stew for a fun lunch. A less formal alternative for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I came across this cozy wine shop and bar while making reservations for dinner at Bilacus next door.  We ordered two wine flights and a couple of small plates recommended by the friendly owner.  With each pour he described in detail not only the flavor profile of each wine, but the history of the region (we chose mostly wines from the Lombardy region - it was a great change of pace after drinking Chianti in Tuscany for the previous few days).  He taught us the differences flavor from one vintage to another, and even gave us tips on finding great quality wines at a lower price tag for when we got back to the States.   I would highly recommend a visit not only for a great snack and glass of wine, but for a lesson in the wine this region has to offer."}
{"text":"We had drinks and appetizers.  The selection of wine was fantastic and the owner was very knowledgeable about Italian wines. We had just arrived in Italy so it was a great introduction."}
{"text":"A fabulous wine bar and shop in Bellagio. We were walking up the steps towards the shops and ran into this place. We were on the look out for something small for lunch. The menu here has lots of small plates along with other main courses and, we decided to pop in a check it out. 

It's small and cosy and the service is first class. They speak great English here and were quite good at recommending things from the menu and the wine list. If you want a house wine or a top rated Italian wine you are likely to find it here. They also have a lot of wines from the Lombardy region and great cold climate Italian wines. 

We shared a large cold plate for lunch and a small ruccola / Parmesan salad. The cold plate had some fabulous cold meats and cheese. Loved it all :-)) the wines were good and I had two amazing wines recommended by the owner. 

A great experience and I would come back here in a heartbeat. This is so my kind of place :-)))"}
{"text":"After more than a week in Italy, my wife was dying. She needed a salad and had been unable to find anything resembling an actual American veggie haul. I discovered Aperitivo Et al had not only salad, but one with avocado on it. My wife, nearly terminal from a lack of vegetables and avocado, jumped at the chance to be reunited with some of her favorite foods.

Watch your step on the way in. There's a step down as you enter that literally everyone misses. (Cue Ned Ryerson.)

Once inside, we were seated quickly. We enjoyed wine from a large menu and my wife scarfed down that salad. \"The avocado's a little hard,\" she muttered. I stared at her with my husbandly death ray and she realized that avocado beggars cannot be avocado choosers in the land of all carbs.

Aperitivo Et al is a tiny, cozy place where you can enjoy lots of different wines. I would have given it five stars, except the table next to us featured a husband and wife who were letting their 6-year-old child watch a football game at full volume on a cell phone. 

1. Don't bring your 6-year-old to a wine bar. That's just stupid.
2. If you do bring your 6-year-old to a wine bar, give him a coloring book or a comic book. Don't give him your phone.
3. If you insist on giving your son your phone, give him headphones. Some of us are trying to drink and/or enjoy tough avocado on lettuce.

I subtract a star because the Aperitivo Et al staff should have thrown broken glass at that family until they left. Instead, the audio assault continued throughout our visit. The boy seemed very excited about the game, which I suppose is nice, because his idiot parents seemed rather tense with one another. After they divorce, I wonder who will get custody of that loud-ass cell phone."}
{"text":"Best place to have wine and a bite in Bellagio. Great owner, cute space, good prices, always hopping and the food- bellisima!

Large salads and the local buckwheat pasta is amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch based on the reviews.  We ordered a reasonably priced local bottle of red wine, the Italian cold cuts and cheese plate and a salad.  The service was spectacular as the server explained the wines and was very attentive.   The food was fresh and very tasty.  I highly recommend the experience.   Reasonable prices for the location and great service.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a salad and stew along with a tasting of local red wines.  A very pleasant memory.  Nice ambiance and friendly, well-informed staff."}
{"text":"Des vins formidables, du fromage excellent et un accueil sensationnel le tout pour un prix plus que raisonnable. Je ne peux rien dire de plus. Tout Ã©tait parfait !  

En plus, on peut acheter des bouteilles."}
{"text":"We were a little tired of the big elaborate Italian restaurant meals and wanted something easier and less formal.  We found this place online here and decided to given them a try.

In addition to having over 40 different wines by the glass and a large menu, they also offer some interesting food/wine pairings options.

Just in case, we stopped in while out getting gelato and made a reservation (Italian restauranteurs always appreciate when you do).

We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation and got a great corner table in this small but cozy air conditioned restaurant-very comfortable.

Our waiter, Andrea (also a sommelier) was so very helpful explaining the various options and choices in English.  We opted for a wine tasting -3 half- glasses of Brunello, the local Nebbiolo and finally Amarone.  With each wine he stopped by and talked about the wine, the vintage and vinification process just like at a winery. We ordered a cheese plate and The local pasta for food and Andrea selected the cheeses that would best pair with our wines-they are serious about food & wine here-all excellent choices.  With the pasta we tried the local Nebbiolo from the high mountain Valtellina region and saved the last of our Amarone to enjoy with grandmas chocolate cake-so good.

This is a must visit for anyone who enjoys food and wine.  The staff is so very helpful and it is not at all stuffy.

Since they are also a wine store, they can ship wine home to the USA if you find something you enjoy.  Several of the wines we tried were produced in very small quantities (like 2,000 bottles) and these guys have a few cases of these very limited wines (and a couple of fewer bottles now in their collection ;) 

Top notch experience overall. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If this is the bar that Bellagio has to offer...sigh.  After reading numerous reviews, my friend and I settled on coming here.  We had read somewhere that it turns into a lively bar atmosphere at night.  Come 8PM, the place was dead.  Also, I'm not sure how the atmosphere could be anything but quaint and cozy given the layout of the restaurant.  The food was edible, but even our waitress said nothing was made on-site.  The pasta tasted as though it was heated up in a microwave.  The house wine was really good and the place was affordable, but that's about it.  

The service was really friendly and there's free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Excellent wine bar serving good food, located in a strategic location in Bellagio. Small venue, intimate enough without being too pretemptious. Good wine list made of unique regional wines as well as the usual italian world famous ones. The food: being an Enoteca don't expect a wide selection, but the quality of what I ordered was definitely a four star rating. I tried Bresaola with Scaglie di Parmigiano (cold cut dish sprinkled with shaved parmesan) and a local dish from Valtellina (a Valley bordering Lake Como) called Pizzoccheri, both excellent. Friendly staff with a great owner who I believe works in the kitchen. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing little wine bar in Bellagio. Coming here was probably my favorite part of visiting the little town. If you like white wine, try the 2014 Lugana. It's a local wine and quite refreshing!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to relax and grab a drink before dinner. We stopped by for a drink before dinner all three nights that we were in Bellagio. It's actually a wine bar, but we ordered cocktails. We were looking for our standard American drinks - Jack/Diet and a Jameson/Ginger.  Most places don't offer this, but Aperitivo hit the mark. The prices are good, wait staff is friendly, and appetizers are delicious. Loved the ravioli!"}
{"text":"This cute little restaurant is a great stop-over on your way to dinner or for after dinner drinks and dessert. It's cozy and has a great selection of local wines. They share a kitchen with the restaurant across the way (which is really good BTW), but they only have some small plates and salads. Nothing too hearty, but really good. The service is also very friendly! :) So go, stop for a drink, stay for some meats & cheeses, and enjoy yourself."}
