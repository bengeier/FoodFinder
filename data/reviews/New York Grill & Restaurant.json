{"text":"I have passed this place a few times and the great smells had snatched me by the nose and smackec my tasted buds for me to turn around. So finally with sometime on my hands me and my wife stopped in. The menu was full of things I wanted to try all at once but I finally went with the Souvlaki Platter and my wife ordered the Baked Ziti, the prices were very reasonable and I was greatly impressed for how small the resturant is. My greek salad was fresh even for it being late at night and my marinated pork was so delicious that my tongue smacked my brains for not stopping before. My wife's ziti was obviously good cause she was giving it praises like no other lol, no to mention the portions were very hefty. The experience wouldnt have been excellent if it wouldn't have been for the ever forgetful waitress. Highly recommonded."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Chicken Souvlaki, Corned Beef sandwich, pierogis, Greek salad are yummy! I've sent many friends there and so far none of them have been disappointed. It's a very casual, comfy place. Nothing fancy but the service is good and personable and an all time Lorsin favorite!"}
{"text":"Better than expected!  Food was well priced, came out quick, and was just what we were looking for.  The brightest spot was the service!  Tessa was very pleasant and accommodating throughout our visit.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The breakfasts here are absolutely phenomenal!    The restaurant is on the corner of East Erie and Florida Avenue, and on a clear day you can peer through a northward alley and get a glimpse of Lake Erie.   Traffic is right off the restaurant front but you don't get a lot of the associated noise."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious food!  Quick service with a smile, and huge portions. A true breakfast trifecta!  Must try jewel in the rough."}
{"text":"The food was bland.  So not worth going a second time.  The building smelled like my grandmothers basement, had dated decor.  Basically this place is a prime canidate for Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot on the east side of Lorain, unfortunately they just moved to Oberlin ave by big lots."}
