{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in town! It's not the best sushi I have ever had in my life, but in my opinion, it's the best available in the Vegas area (without burning a flaming hole in your pocket).

The all you can eat option includes unlimited appetizers (edamame, calamari, salad, soup, etc), lots of creative flavorful sushi rolls (you can also request your own), and one dessert (my favorite is the strawberry mochi).

The Cajun Albacore is tasty and they always have Ama Ebi available, which I could only get in December in New York (for Ama Ebi lovers, the fried shrimp heads are available if you ask). Ama Ebi and Uni are not included in the lunch all you can eat, and only one serving per person at dinnertime. The calamari appetizer is delicious!

It's a cozy and casual place (reminds me of many sushi places back in NY) and the sushi chefs are very friendly. The wait staff is polite, and I think they'd be more friendly if English were their first language.

I sometimes go to Makino for the sushi buffet when I want to pig out and don't mind poor quality fish, but when I'm in the mood for fresh tasty fish, I always go to Wonder Sushi!!

Lunch is about $21 and dinner is $25.

{"text":"It's closed, not sure when it happened, but its gone. There is a orange sticker on the door from some law enforcement agency. We've dined here several times and liked it, but have gone elsewhere since there were so many choices in town. Today we went to Tay Yo on Eastern (EX Makinos) and they were out of business too! Then to Wonder Sushi and they are history too. Bad day for Sushi, I guess. We had mediocre burritos at Rubios. Had my mouth all set for Sushi and was twice dissapointed. The warning sticker on the door makes me Wonder about Wonder Sushi. Sad times for everyone."}
{"text":"I went here last nite after a long day of site seeing in the Valley of Fire National Park and we were very hungry.  So this place fit our hunger very well.  We started with the Miso soup which was yummy.  Good way to start out our early dinner since hiking on the trails tired us out.
We then got a variety of rolls and some side dishes....Everything was tasty but I was disappointed in the presentation of the rolls.  They broke apart easily and were not consistent in size.  We definitely got our moneys worth leaving really full.  I'd go back if I was in the mood for trying a variety of sushi. 
My favorite roll was the royal dragon....deep fried dragon roll....tempura, cream cheese, avacado, etc.
I did notice on some of the rolls where shrimp wasn't the main ingredient...they used baby shrimp."}
