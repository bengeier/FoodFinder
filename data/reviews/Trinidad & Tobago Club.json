{"text":"Although primarily this is the cultural centre for Calgarians from Trinidad & Tobago, a couple serves lunch Tue through Fri.  The menu is \"roti\", but not the kind you're probably used to.  You have a choice of beef, chicken, vegetarian, or goat.  This is a hearty homemade meal, consisting of a large \"pita\" filled with a curry \"stew\" (potatoes, chick peas, curry sauce, meat).  They make their own hot sauce from Scotch Bonnet peppers - and it's hot!  The curry isn't plain either...  The room is large with lounge chairs that aren't really meant for dining, and the big screen is usually on the sic-fi channel.  The staff are friendly, and the clientele is mostly regulars.  We had a regular office group going here weekly at lunch until recently.  I can't go back nearly as often as I'd like now!  People seem to either love it or hate it - try it once and see!  Definitely a unique experience!"}

{"text":"I love this place.   The first time I came here I was a bit nervous about the setting since it looked more like a clubhouse than a restaurant. But, it was love at first bite and I haven't looked back. Sticking to its laid back island roots, it accomplishes what it sets out to do which is serving up fantastic Caribbean curries. No frills, the club has a small menu offering beef patties and four curry options (beef, chicken, shrimp and goat) served in a fresh roti or on rice with steaming chunks of curried potato and channa on the side. Every time I come here, the biggest struggle is deciding which curry to get (goat remains my favorite) and whether I want it in a roti or on rice #thestruggleisreal. Whatever you choose though, there isn't a wrong choice. All curries are packed with flavor and spices and although it might sound like a heavy meal, the Caribbean way of cooking curry without coconut milk makes it a somewhat lighter dish. I'm not lying when I say each time I've come here for lunch, I've toyed with ordering takeout to have the same thing for dinner. I will probably make this a reality in the near future.  And, if heat is your thing, their homemade hot sauce is SO good. Sure, I'm coughing, my nose is running and I want to dunk my tongue in ice, but it's worth every moment. In fact, they even call it 'Oh-Z Hotsauce' and package it up for retail sale. I recommend you purchase this and enjoy the burn but proceed slowly. I'm not kidding when I saw a very little goes a VERY long way."}
