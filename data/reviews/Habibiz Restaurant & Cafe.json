{"text":"What a sh*tty place... It says \"Restaurant & Cafe\" but don't expect to find any food here! I walked in and asked for a menu to see what they have, the guy looked at me like I was ridiculous for even asking and said \"uhhh we don't have food it's like... a shisha bar\" and raised his eyebrows at me, giving me a look as if to say \"are you stupid or something?\". Suffice it to say, he was EXTREMELY rude! If the establishment calls itself a \"Restaurant & Cafe, you'd think they would expect to have people asking for FOOD! Ridiculous. And despite the Drake shout-outs, the place isn't all that! I've seen way better hookah joints!"}
{"text":"lol im a regular here, its convenient, its local and there really isnt much to do in scarborough but shisha and eat. but these guys have enough business thanks to drake where they can put a little more effort to wipe down their tables periodically so im not sitting on a mountain of ash every. they could seriously benefit from some women in that place. hire meeeee dammit, i have to wipe down those booths with a baby wipe every time im there, they may as well just pay me! oh also, the new raised prices...commmonnnnnnn -_____-"}
{"text":"Worst experience that's for sure! I don't understand why but the younger kids start to stare at you as if there's going to be a fight. Our shisha was over within 20mins and they didn't bother to replace it. Under age staff and costumers. It's weird that Drake goes here. You have to pay up front, they give you a number which they forget and uncomfortable furniture."}
{"text":"This cafe has gotten a lot of bad reviews (see below), and I'm not quite sure why. They have done some renovations and they do serve food items like wraps and fries. There is no alcohol though. I found the Habibiz special shisha to be quite good - they have the oranges, pineapples etc. a lot of places have as well. 

A lot of people know this place to be where Drake frequents occasionally (as seen in videos, Instagram), and although I have yet to see him, I do know he definitely comes by. Habibiz is a local spot, so most customers are from Scarborough. I wouldn't say it's the best shisha place in Toronto, but I do not mind it at all."}
{"text":"Really bad service and staff don't know anything about customer service. Asking to pay before I even sat on the table asking only cash and their ATM machine doesn't work."}
{"text":"Good vibes, good times. The music is loud at times but I love it. It's always fun coming here. Takes only cash or debit. It gets packed in here fast, recommend coming at a good time to nab a spot. Boss shisha bar in the 6ix."}
{"text":"Not the best shisha bar I've been to, I don't get what Drake keeps raving on about! LOL"}
{"text":"I've been to a few shisha places in the GTA and this by far is the worst.  I'm glad I didn't start shisha here, or else I probably wouldn't give it another shot.  When we walked in, there was a staff member at the front and we clearly were wondering if there was any empty tables and he literally just stood there staring at us. I didn't know he was staff until we walked up to the counter. 

They dont have any menus... it's literally a piece of paper taped to their front counter and you choose your shisha flavour.  I don't think they offer any food (looks like most ppl were bringing their own food in) and unlike most other shisha places there's no special drinks.  

The place is super super dirty.  It took me a long time to sit semi comfortably.  The seats are all burned, our table had a missing marble piece, and spilled coffee (or what looked like coffee) on it and the window ledge was full of dust and ash.  I can't believe how poorly maintained it was. 

The music was too loud for my liking. And very random, sometimes played super quiet, other times blasted.  It also sounded like it was played from someone's phone because you can randomly hear text messages come in. 

It is cheaper than other shisha lounges - which may be why they are unkept. But I still was extremely disappointed. I'd rather pay an extra 10.00 and feel greeted and comfortable sitting where I am, than feeling unwelcomed and grossed."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you are a shisha addict, you go at the right time, its quiet and nobody is there, you can like it. Friday, Sat or Sun nights forget it because they will be playing Drake until your ears bleed. The speakers are so loud that the subs have blown a long time ago and its flat treble. The service is shit as hell and slow. 

The guys behind the counter look at you as if youre here to start a fight, not to pay for a shisha which helps them keep their jobs. God, this place is disgusting and thank the lord they opened a new place on Lawrence Ave. I hope the riff raff from this location does not screw up the other place too. 

I love their Mint shisha though so I keep going back just for that."}
{"text":"I've been to over a dozen hookah bars and Habibiz has by far one of the best shisha mixes/flavours you'll ever get. The head of your shisha will last you a really long time and the food is actually really good! The only downfall is the music. It's not crappy, it's just always EXTREMELY LOUD. But it's worth it, for the shisha, the food, and the service!"}
{"text":"Heard of this place. When we walked in, no signs or greeting by stuff. Place seems in need of love. Needs cleaning and fixing ( different surfaces like ceiling and couches) at this moment takes cash only and it's pay up front only. Food is super basic. No Manu to even look at. The decoration style is dark themed which I don't mind if it wasn't all warn down. Hooka selection is basic. Prices match the look tho. 30$ gets u tea pot, fries and orange head hooka. This place could be so much more."}
{"text":"The music is thumpin'. Sheesha is amazing. I got the Pineapple Habibi special. It was great. The crowd is well diversified and the atmosphere is energetic. This place is usually packed! That's a good thing. 

Cons- the burgers are good but take way to long to make and receive."}
{"text":"So far the best shisha place I HV been to. Amazing customer service. Well manage stuff. Every time I went got proper customer service. Recommend everyone to visit at list one time to see how well they are doing with customer & business."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place a 1 star is because 0 stars isnt an option. In my 9 years of smoking shisha weekly I haven't been to a shittier customer service shisha spot. I recommend smoking cigarettes before coming to this place."}
{"text":"The service is Horrible... under staffed for sure.
It has the grunge dirty feel to it, which is ok for a HANGOUT but not when there is food served at the establishment. \"CAFE\"

This business is not well kept for it's customers."}
{"text":"Where is the habibiz (love) ? Only gets a star because that's the lowest I can offer it...writing this review to prevent other potential victims to a mediocre hookah joint. 

Review - when drake rapped\" it's my birthday I can get high if i have to\" he probably was high when he walked in here because the lights would have that effect but if you're walking here to expect some extra fun save your time ...cause it's a 1 star hookah joint to me. I can have a better session in my room than this average restaurant.

Staff- very late, too busy eating Shwarma & falafels  to help their customers...took 15 minutes just to get the guys attention.

Seating - no problem finding a seat, but getting into it is another habibiz..like chairs are so close together in order to sit in those Comfy sofa areas is you need to move the furniture first.

Music- I understand its suppose to have a middle eastern vibe...but stop playing tracks that all sound the same...promoting habibi habibi .. Like I understand.

Shisha experience - not great...using fruits such as oranges as flavour holders .. Creative but USELESS! I'll give them the Martha Stewart award for the fruitiest hookah set up. Also it came to a point where the whole apparatus was oozing blood like fluid...and that's when I realized its time to yalla habibi.

Washroom- only best part about this joint...cause I could take the nicest leak in peace

Price- reasonable 15$ but waste with the experience I had."}
{"text":"Best vibes I love it!! Just a little annoying how you always have to pre paid but it's whatever."}
{"text":"Strange place. 
Blue lights.
Bad service.
Bad food.
It's a neighbourhood hangout for sheesha smokers. 
If you're not a local, you'll find this place strange."}
{"text":"Music is a bit loud. Food menu wasn't all that. But shisha was very good. Ambience is alright. club lighting. They give you three extra coals. Lot of people. Some booths are reserved on Saturdays after 9. So get there early on Saturdays. Try the blue myst shisha. That was good. Only cash and debit. Worth a second visit (for shisha only)."}
{"text":"Too dark, too loud, too overpriced ... Its an okay place if youve never been to a shisha place before. But for a place like scarborough, there are many, way better places to go!"}
{"text":"Ex flavours desert place which I really miss :(

Hmm how should I sum it up..
Place is Super loud
Club atmosphere
Good sheesha 
Live crowed
Lots of creepy guys who stare their eye balls out  lots of chilled out ppl as well 
Kinda Too packed n congested
Lots of overly dressed chix as if it's some afghan club 
Overall I would say it's a fun spot to pass time but probably suits youths aged 16-23"}
{"text":"Amazing shisha flavours but the music does get way too loud at times. I give this place 3 stars because it is not very organized and friendly. Besides loud music, the cafe itself is like....extremely dark. So now you can't hear to OR see which isn't cool when you're trying to cruise around the cafe.

The cafe itself isn't very big, it is rather narrow so I'm not sure how the employees and the belly dancers do their thing without catching on fire. The service is also very slow but I guess that's because the staff has a hard time finding the tables since it's so dark LOL (no hate though).

There aren't a lot of issues when it comes to seating but be prepared to wait to get in. There is usually a line even though there are multiple open seats so try arriving early or even calling to see if they are busy (specially on weekends)."}
