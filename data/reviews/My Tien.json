{"text":"We had a really bad experience at this place. I wasn't going to bother leaving a review, but when I saw the other review and how the owner responded, I felt the need to.

First, we showed up on a Friday night, at prime supper time, and the place was  completely dead. This is never a good sign. However, we'd been meaning to check out the new kid on the block so we ventured in. 

We took a seat by the window, with a table full of dirty plates behind us that was never cleared the whole time we sat there, despite the fact that the restaurant was empty and their were no other customers to serve. First strike out on cleanliness.

The owner was generally amenable at first, bringing us some menus and a class of ice water. We ordered our food and my partner was brought out his soup, an asparagus and crab concoction. I tasted it and it was okay. Nothing to write home about, in my opinion, but not terrible either.

Then our meals came out. I had ordered chicken with lemongrass and my partner, chicken with peanut sauce and crispy spinach. I have to agree with the previous reviewer that our meals tasted completely bland. I could hardly taste the lemongrass in mine (it seemed basically non-existent), and I tasted the bf's dish, and it was equally bland and uninspiring. We love Asian cuisine, be it Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, fusion etc., and we've been to all of the other restaurants on the same block. In our opinion, the other places are far superior to My Tien. My dish tasted mostly of salt and not much else, and the bf's serving was really puny, so he ended up helping me finish my chicken lemongrass. We were hungry so we did end up eating most of the food.

Because my dish was so salty, I started to become extremely thirsty. I hadn't received a refill of water since we'd sat down. We kept looking back at the kitchen, trying to get the owner's attention so that he'd bring us more water. I could have easily have downed a full pitcher. After about 5 minutes of straining our heads towards the back of the restaurant, my bf finally got up to grab the pitcher of water from the counter and serve us, as I was becoming unbearably thirsty. The owner's wife saw him do this, at which point the owner hastened to come out from the back and serve us some water, apologizing.

I have to wonder, if your restaurant is empty and you can't serve your only two clients well, what are you doing in this business? Word of mouth and first impressions are everything. After this, the owner seemed a bit more present, taking our dishes away at the end of the meal, but he never asked us if we wanted anything else.

Let me say that never in my life have I not left a tip at a restaurant. Never. And it wasn't my intention to do so at My Tien. When I was paying with my card, the buttons seemed to get stuck and I couldn't enter the tip amount that I wanted to. However, as soon as my receipt printed out, the owner jumped on me right away, asking me if I was aware I'd left the same amount as my bill. I literally had my hand in my wallet to pull out some coins, but he seemed so money-focused that it completely stunned and offended me. He started to ask me aggressively what was wrong with his service, at which point I decided that I was not going to tip this off-putting individual. I simply said, \"your service was just alright\" and smiled, while trying to back out of the restaurant. He continued to berate us, and I couldn't actually believe it was happening.

To the owner of My Tien I say: if you want a tip, first serve your customers well and attentively.  Second, if you don't get the tip you wanted, do not berate your customers, as this will probably have the opposite effect. People are not likely to give you their money if they feel attacked.

Needless to say, we will not be back at My Tien nor will we recommend it to anyone. Perhaps the owner was just having a bad day, and I do wish them well despite my bad experience."}

{"text":"A nice place for Southern Vietnamese food.  If u look for a Pho, it's not a place to be. But if you want to discover some other options. It is a perfect place.

{"text":"Alright, I wish these folks well and I'll totally go back and see if I can find more stars in my heart for them, because it's a nice enough clean bright spot on Jean Talon and St Laurent... 

But here's what happened: I ordered a peanut butter chicken trio which came with a soup and rice. The soup was served immediately and was tasteless, medium warm, and had a sheen and just a hint of soap in the flavour. I asked for a glass of water and as I gulped it down was hit with another bitter sudsy mouthful. Soap. By the time the peanut chicken was served all I could taste in the fairly bland sauce was more soap. The crispy basil was a relief, but crispy basil doesn't not a satisfying lunch break make. I took nothing home for leftovers, and I am usually an avid leftover taker (my fridge full of take out containers I present as evidence.) 

I went up to pay the friendly smiling couple behind the counter and after paying, I said quietly: \"Just wanted to let you know, the water and the sauce tasted quite a bit like soap.\" An exchange in Vietnamese. A sneer. \"You ate what everybody else ate and no one else complained.\" A sigh on my part. \"I'm not asking asking for anything, just offering my two cents in case it's helpful.\" And to this I did receive a fairly gracious thanks and we'll look into it. And so I shrugged it off and went home to plow the fields of takeout containers in my fridge for an edible, or perhaps just less aggressively clean, lunch."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time giving My Tien a rating I ended up giving them a 2 because I don't think they deserve a 1 biased on my experience anyways . I took the lunch special  came with a soup of the day which was a crab and egg I think wasn't bad wasn't good really plain and boring. As a main I took a mixed plate of chicken beef and shrimp again nothing special I think I could of made better at home I didn't read the reviews before I came sadly :(.. I don't think I'll come back"}
