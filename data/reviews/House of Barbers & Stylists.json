{"text":"Today was the first time we have been to this awesome business. Ritchie took care of us and I don't think I have ever seen someone take that much time and care with a client. We will definitely be coming back. They have gained a for life client."}
{"text":"In New York Kat has always done my hair and I seriously have never found anyone else as amazing when it comes to styling or that I could trust with my hair. I have thick hair and she always had the patience to deal with my hair and make it look so beautiful. She is confident and creative but, her talent shows once you look in the mirror from a session with her. An overall amazing stylist and I cant wait for her to visit NY."}
{"text":"New to Arizona, stopped in to get cleaned up before dinner. Was taken care of and got lined up perfectly. Nice to come to an establishment where people understand cutting hair is a skilled craft not a just a hobby. He took his time, good conversation and explained everything to me because I was a new customer. Class act! Customer for life."}
{"text":"I have been struggling with my hair since I moved from NYC 10 yrs ago.  I tried a few salons here but the results were always the same, disappointment.  Due to a medical condition I started to loose my hair 3yrs ago, for this reason i just stopped getting my hair done.  When I met Kat, she was very professional and very sensitive to my needs.  She customized her techniques to meet my individual needs and made me feel comfortable.    Thanks Kat for making me love my hair and feel beautiful again!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Kat is absolutely amazing. She has been doing my hair for over 4 years now, and you can see the improvement. She is professional, dedicated, creative and most of all she listens to her clients. You will love her!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best experience I have ever had here every time I bring son to get a cut Tony is always great and patient and does an excellent job I wouldn't take my son anywhere else"}
{"text":"Just had an awesome experience with richie. From the very beginning he was very welcoming and courteous. Right away i could tell he is passionate about what he does. This man can cut hair i was looking for something different than my normal taper fade. I explained i had a new job and he just went with it. I highly recommend seeing richie if you're unsure where to go or just looking for something different!!++plus he stays open passed 5 o clock."}
{"text":"Katherine is such an amazing hair stylist she has so much passion for what she does that u will never leave unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Katherine has been doing my hair for over a year and absolutely an amazing stylist. I am beyond picky with who I select to get my hair done by...I am from New York so I am use to having a good stylist and I know the difference between having a person who knows what they are doing and those that don't. I know when I am being pressured into a test object and when someone really knows how to treat my hair and not just what they want to do to my head. I know when someone will say I understand you want to do this, but honestly as a stylist I cannot recommend this for your hair, you only doing damage, and those are very hard to find.   I have had those bad experiences of people testing on my head as if I am a lab rat...  Well, look no longer because this young lady is amazing and you won't regret her taking care of you and doing a great job.   She takes her time, she's respectful, she's professional and very welcoming. It's hard to find a good blow- out spot in Arizona, especially when you are use to a great NY blow out. Well, AZ folks, she is here. She started at NYC Salon in Mesa and now taking her Talent to a new spot. Give her your support, you won't regret the experience of the salon and the amazing owner and staff there.   It's a really family friendly environment and they are amazingly warm, honest -pour love!!!!   You want people that's loyal, that you can open up to, say things to that won't assume or take it personal. If you tell your stylist you don't want something done, it's not a pressure and they can say OK I won't do that! You want someone, that's professional at all time and that's open and honest with you, if you build professional relationship with...they can be open and honest at all times. You want someone that CARE your HAIR and not just style it or you becoming their test object or lab rat...YOU want a person that values your HAIR and CARE your HAIR!!!  I highly recommend her at all cost and on ALL LEVELS!!!!!"}
{"text":"This shop does it all from straight hair to curly and from braids to dreads and extensions. It's a combo Barbershop up front and full service hair salon in the back. They just celebrated their Grand Opening and already have a full clientele.  They are so good. The staff really cares and want their clients to return so they put in the extra time. The best in AZ."}
{"text":"I can't wait to get back to AZ to get my hair done by Kat.  She's so pleasant and always easy to talk to. Her skills with curly hair is undeniably the best in Arizona; by far! See you soon!! :)"}
{"text":"Richie did a great job. I am very particular when it comes to my hair and when i moved to the east valley i had a hard time finding a good barber. Richie took his time, the conversation was great, and he had some great suggestions for me. I will be going back for my next cut!"}
{"text":"I've gotten my hair done with Kat and she is a true expert when it comes to hair. She is always caught up with the latest trends and her recommendations will not steer you wrong. She knows what cut and color look good for your tone and face shape but most importantly she listens to what you want out of your style. P.S: I have hair for like 4 heads and find it hard to find a good stylist so I'm very happy she's in AZ."}
{"text":"I took my son here as a walk-in on 9/23:  Mistake No. 1 no greeting (((Ugh))), Mistake No. 2 he wand up waiting 3 hours before he even got in a chair, and it wasn't even crowded, Mistake No. 3 the barbers are slow they do waaaay to much talking instead of cutting hair, Mistake No. 4 not to mention the very uncomfortable low to the floor seating in the waiting area and lastly Mistake No. 5, uh the cuts are mediocre for the price, so with each star available to choose before Zelp lets you post a review, they're definitely getting Zilch / Zero!  Only chose 1 star bcz I had to choose one but again big fat ZERO!!!   Never, ever again.  I recommend (King of Kurtz) right across the street or (The Shop by Leftys) in Ahwatukee.  Just Google them,  you'll find their location.   - Philly all the Way,"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my boyfriend to wait as he got his hair cut. Let me say Richie is one of the Best Barbers/Stylist Ive been too. He really does enjoy his profession. Greets everyone with warm open smiles, and easily makes you feel right at home. Ended up booking an appointment to have my hair colored and cut. Was in great hands from start to finish. He takes you through the full steps of service and ever makes sure you leave knowing how to best style your hair for when your at home! Would recommend Richie to all hair types!!"}
{"text":"Im going to let the hair speak for itself because Kat always does an amazing job. She is sooooo good that I'm in the salon like twice a week. I don't even bother trying to touch my hair.... She is the hair savior !!!! The absolute best!"}
{"text":"Great environment! Knowledgable  individuals with great experience to help you with your hair!  A must for ALL people!"}
