{"text":"Can't get better pizza anywhere. Period. The marinara with the perfect bread sticks is so delicious. Wings are good size and cooked perfectly. My family has decided to make Donte's at least a once a week event. Their Sunday special and all of their specials are great deals. Do yourself a favor and get to Donte's. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great place. The food is really good.  The food is ready when they say with no waiting. It's a great place for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Consistantly delicious, traditional, nonchain pizza. Great crust, sweet but not too sweet sauce and generous toppings plus an awesome menu filled with \"non-pizza\" items makes this place a great go-to for pizza parlor food. Their portions are super generous, and their pizzas are made fast. Even when they're super busy food makes it to the table quickly. I love, love, LOVE green olives on my pizza, and they still have them as a topping. If I feel like a pie, this is where I go."}
{"text":"After a round of golf at South Park, I picked a close pizza joint on the way back to my hotel.  Wow!  What a great find!  I ordered a meatball calzone and it was huge!  Made with fresh dough and loaded with ricotta and mozzarella and lots of meatballs. Delicious!!  Bonus: I have tomorrow's lunch Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the south hills, the only thing better is Fiori's.  The only thing that would make it better would be delivery.  However it  soooo worry the drive"}
{"text":"Bethel and south park have bad pizza options this is the best option around its ok but nothing to travel for like some other Pittsburgh pizza institutions, but if your in the area and have to have pizza it's ok. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the 'burgh!  We get take-out from here at least once a week.  The pizza has the most amazing sauce, sweet but not too sweet and the perfect amount of cheese.  We never order pizza from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area..... period. Thin crust, delicious sauce and high quality cheese."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for the first time from here. The pizza was just bland and a little sweet. I expect a pizza to have flavor but the crust, sauce, and cheese were all just lacking in flavor. Also, the crust was soggy from about half way in to the center. We just got a traditional with pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers so it shouldn't have been soggy. I gave it 2 stars because it didn't make us suck or anything, there's just nothing really good about it either. We won't go back again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the south hills hands down... Great service and friendly employees also."}
{"text":"There are thousands of pizza shops in the nation and everyone starts out to make the same thing but everyone puts their twist on the end product in order to make it theirs. Donte's is no different and their end product is the absolute best!  Our son told us of the best pizza his family ate so we decided to give it a try. I read the reviews regarding many factors but we are not nit pickers. We recognized Donte as soon as we walked in and the service was superb. We have been back many times and will be back many many more times. Great food and staff!

{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had!!! I seriously love coming here any chance I get! Defiantly a must and great customer service!"}
{"text":"My dad says it tastes like Fiores pizza due to the sweet sauce.  I've never been to Fiores, but he claims it's one of the best in Pittsburgh.  My dad asked about it, the owner of Dantes used to work at Fiores.  They have a game room with air hockey and some arcade games.  The pizza is a different kind of pizza, long thin slices with really stringy cheese.  You need a fork and knife to eat it, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Finally a place near South Park and pleasant hills that is good and not a chain. Nice staff and quick pick up service. Only had the pizza but looking forward to trying other things. Only complaint is the parking lot can be tight since they share with other businesses. 
Definitely give them a try if you have not"}
{"text":"Staff- Friendly and helpful
Wait - Reasonable- Good
Food - Good, I generally by a basic item as my first,so went with Traditional pizza with a sausage topping.  Bit greasy but was good, tasty. Next time will try one of their specials and update all."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and thought we would give it a try.  Ordered a lot of food,  wings, pizza, salads and fried mushrooms.  I love a good greasy pizza, don't get me wrong, but it was almost soup.   They have to be losing money given the amount of cheese on our salads but the homeade salad dressing was delicious.   The wings were good.  We tried the buffalo and the garlic butter.   Fried mushrooms were yummy.

The best part of the place are the distractions for kids.   While we were waiting the 4 - 11 year old boys had a rousing air hockey tournament."}
{"text":"my son (from Miami Beach) told me that I should try Dontes Pizza. he said it\"s the best.. Today  I had the \"Best Pizza\" I've ever had. It arrived at our table looked like  molten lava, bubbling up on the dish. We ordered extra cheese and pepperoni. When we started to eat it ,we needed to cut the pieces with a knife. The first two bites were just cheese,(the way we like it)the next was just superior pizza. Everyone who likes pizza owes it to themselves to go there, it is that \"great\"."}
{"text":"For the longest time, Donte's was my favorite pizza place. I have since found a new favorite, HOWEVER, Donte's is still top 3. It's absolutely delish. The sauce is a little sweet, the cheese is so delicious and melty and their crust is one of my favorites EVER- it's thick and puffy, but has a nice crunch. So good. The service is always great, and the food is ALWAYS good. Their wedgies are really good and so are their fries with their special seasoning salt! Donte's is great for take-out, but also for dining in! Especially if you have children with you- the back room has a decent amount of arcade games and their is a section with chalk. My little cousin's always had fun in that back room and it made waiting for your pizza not so bad. I love this place."}
{"text":"Tasty wings. Pizza toppings were very fresh. The dipping sauce that went with the garlic bread with cheese was amazing. Duane, the owner, obviously loves what he does."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. I had it for the first time Saturday and was craving it the next day. 

The only recommendation I have for the business: I was looking at your website and the pictures show employees using their bare hands to make salads and to pick up pasta; this can cost you business as it appears unsanitary."}
{"text":"Pizza is average, breadsticks and sauce are good, wings are average. Do not, I repeat do not get the steak. I am a steak and potato guy through and through, but this steak is horrible!  The steak tasted like bad seafood and smelt like it as well. The owner didn't know how to take a complaint and stated the steak was just fine and I didn't know what I was talking about (so he ate a piece in front of me). I wasn't looking for ignorance and selfishness just the sandwich taken off my bill. All in all stay to the basics here pizza with only cheese or pepperoni and breadsticks. The other food is sub-par at best."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza around the Pittsburgh area. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Used Yelp to find a pizza place since I moved to a new area and this did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Pizza - an East Coast staple. What's the difference? They say it's the water and definitely the sauce. So how did Dante's measure up?  

We started off with a bowl of cheese with some lettuce underneath, aka, salad :) Pretty darn good. The cheese had great consistency and flavor but after a few bites I had to push the cheese aside and just go for the greens.  Decent sized bowl for just over a buck. 

The pizza - I admit, freaking good. While the crust was thin and had good doughy consistency, the sauce and cheese stole the show.  I started with the purist plain cheese before digging into a second slice of pepperoni and mushrooms.  My only thing might be that the crust gets a bit soggy towards the end.  We got a bowl of sauce on the side and you noticed how sweet it was when not cooked into the pie. 

I already know I've never had any pizza like this in California, so why not 5 Stars?  To get 5 Stars in my book, you gotta blow my socks off. There can be nothing wrong. I guess Dante's was close but no cookie. 

Service was friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are kinda pizza snobs, so when moving to South Park we were out to find the best pizza. I mean come on does Mineos compare to any other pizza in Pittsburgh? Well I found this jem and was not disappointed! They are cheesy and yummy just like our favorite pizza place and only 6 minutes from our house. Try it, you will love it too!"}
{"text":"It's Fiore's pizza under a different name. Seeing as Fiore's is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, I guess that means Donte's is the best as well!"}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome. I really don't know what else to say about it. Everything from the crust, sauce, cheese and toppings are fresh with great flavor. 

The employees are great. They took care of me fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Pizza is incredible. One of the best in Pittsburgh. Breadsticks are just ok. Wings are really good."}
{"text":"We had a big children's birthday party there for our sons. The staff was friendly and attentive. The pizza was great and the room was large enough to accommodate our large group"}
{"text":"I was SO sad when I moved from the South Side area to South Park because of the lack of local pizza delivery options! Then I discovered Donte's. Although they don't deliver (please consider!) it is well worth the effort to pick up. The deep dish pizza is incredible. It reminds me of a smaller version of Vincent's Pizza Park, with more cheese. It looks small, but it's very dense and filling! 

As far as the interior goes, my fiance usually does the picking up so I have only seen the it once and didn't pay much attention, but it looked clean and nice. Nothing fancy, but who wants to eat at a fancy pizza joint anyway? If you get the \"Italian Style\" pizza (chunky tomato sauce and uncooked shredded cheese on top- kind of like a round Beto's,) I highly recommend eating it there so the cheese doesn't melt.

Keep up the good work, Donte's! :)"}
{"text":"Dontes pizza is a great pizzeria if your looking for good pizza. Whenever I visit Pittsburgh and am in the mood for pizza, I always go to Dontes. The crust is always puffed up, which makes it soft and chewy. This time I order a mushroom pizza, and I was happy that the mushrooms were fresh and not from a can! You can certainly tell the difference, and I hate mushrooms from the can. The service is always great! If you dine in they have a little arcade area in the back which is always nostalgic and fun! I would recommend trying Dontes the next time you get pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this pizzeria! My whole family loves it as well. My stepson is a very picky eater and he devours their wings! I strongly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Donte's is our favorite pizza place. We've been eating here since it opened 8 years. It's owned by a couple who know how to please their customers. 
They have pizza, wings, hoagies, and pasta. Out of everything they have available my favorite thing is their cheese pizza. You know it's good pizza if you don't need toppings to bring the flavor. When I do get toppings one of my favorite is meatball. The meatballs are handmade. Yum!
They have daily specials-several to choose from and they are all good. They have a Sunday special that includes a large cheese pizza, a dozen wings, their own version if bread sticks with 2 dipping sauces, and a 2 liter of soda for $24!!!  We come here after church a lot to take advantage of the special
The have a couple of pinball machines, an air hockey table and TV's that are tuned in to sports.  Great food!  Get some!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza around ! Make sure you try it with cold cheese on top. We order from Donte's on a regular basis, and have never had a bad experience. I also love the fact that they sell by the slice, it's convenient at lunch time. If you have never tried Donte's, you're missing out."}
{"text":"When my son first told me that there was a place called 'Donte's Pizza'  that had the best pizza, I was leery. After all, my son is a pizza junkie and on a hungry day would able Sheetz pizza good., I'm not a big pizza fan, but then I saw they had the Italian style, where the cheese is added last.

I fell in love. It is better than Betos. But that isn't the reason for this review. Donte's can't be beat. All the way around.

They have a back party room, which is free is you order X amount of food. I think it's a 100.00 but if you're having a party, that is what you'll spend and you get so much food, you'll take a ton home.

This year was the second year in a row I had my grandsons party there. The room was big enough for his classmates and family. Again, I was not disappointed at all. The food was got delicious and prompt, Duane and the guys made sure all out needs were met and they was attentive.

I ordered pizza, sandwiches, salad and rigatoni.

Everyone raved about the food and rightfully so. Everything was superb.

My eldest son is having a picnic wedding and I will be ordering the rigatoni and salad from Dontes. For the price, the taste and amount you get, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I like Donte's! Granted when you walk in on a Friday night and they're busy they can be a little gruff to talk to but the food is outstanding. I guess you have to take the atmosphere and call it \"city living\" similar to the service you get when you go to Mineos in the squirell hill."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go for the best pizza and homemade goodness either by take out or eating in! Awesome family atmosphere:) The owners are class acts and strive to make you happy. Lunch specials are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally did last night. I was very pleased with my order of their \"small\" pizza and a steak hoagie. Awesome pie, the 8 cut pizza had big thick slices, with a great cheese ratio, i always get light sauce, but they way they make their pizza i think i can do normal next time. Dough was nice and fluffy, had a nice subtle sweetness to it. The pizza could have been cooked a bit longer. Good sauce, not too sweet or \"zesty\". The steak sandwich was good, i like the way they do it, \"lettuce , mayo, tomato\", good bread. This location is also very close to my house, so I think I found a new spot, definitely worth a try!"}
