{"text":"Ok, so Yelp is a great resource and usually pretty reliable.  So when my husband saw all the positive, glowing reviews for Danforth Pizza House and found the old-school family operation enduring and commendable, it was a no-brainer; we jumped into a cab from downtown and got over there pronto.  The outside was exactly as others had described: non-descript, old window writing, dark inside, we could have missed it.  As we enter, there was the older gentleman behind the counter.  We greeted him and gave him our order.  We sat quietly at one of the table in the back and waited with great anticipation for 20 minutes (which compared to others, wasn't so bad).  We saw the gentleman hand roll the dough and work his skills with awe.    Then we get the pizza and, sadly, it was only... okay.  A bit of a disappointment.  We got it with onions and green peppers.  The dough was nice, thick and crusty.  But the sauce was bland and lacked flavor.  And the cheese wasn't much better.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but all the raving reviews had us expecting something more.    We only went the one time, so I'm not sure if it was just an off-night or just our pizza.  Either way, I think I can say their pizza isn't consistent, at best.    But from a philosophical standpoint, I would recommend Danforth Pizza House because I would want others to patronize this establishment.  I appreciate the small town, authentic feel of this place and would hate to see them go out of business.  And there are loyal followers out there that suggests that they do have a good pie.  I would say go, check them out, but temper your expectations and know that they lack in ambiance."}
{"text":"Average pizza at best , really didn't get all the hype . Was let down . Nice people though I just wasn't crazy about the pizza ."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, last time a friend and I were there someone didn't come to pick up their medium pizza order, which would have been 20-25 bucks, and the owner gave it to us for $15 which was really nice of him. Nice valentine's day surprise :) The crust is crunchy, the toppings all taste very fresh, and although the crust could be a little bit thinner for my liking (as a true Italian) it is by far one of the best pizza places in the six. Big ups to the owner! Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto hands down.  Those who don't get it don't understand good pizza.  A true family business.  I feel lucky when I get one and I get lucky often."}
{"text":"Clearly, this is the best pizza in the area. Clearly. No other spot comes close. The joint down the block is good, very good, but not even close to Danforth Pizza House. There truly are only two minor drawbacks, and neither are food related. They only take cash, but make no mention if this at all (there is avery small sign inside which doesn't help when you have already arrived). Seeing as how often cards are used, it'd be professional and forward thinking to tell each customer on the phone, make it clearer, etc. Secondly, they are quite expensive.   THAT GRIPING ASIDE... This is hands down, the BEST pizza in the area. You pay for what you get, and if that means a 2 minute jaunt to the ATM, so be it. Try it, you'll see. Totally worth it.   BUYER BEWARE: Obviously if you order a pie at 7:25pm on a Friday it will take time. It's Friday. Plan ahead and be prepared to wait a bit if it's a high volume time. You aren't ordering Pizza Pizza garbage here, this is good food."}
{"text":"Old school pizza made by amazing people Danforth pizza house is sooo mouth watering DELICIOUS. I wish they delivered but it is so worth the walk up there to get a pizza, the dough is so light and fluffy and cooked to perfection. This pizza melts in your mouth it is sooo good and the staff makes u feel very welcome. They just renovated and the store looks amazing. If you haven't tried this pizza GO. They are 100% better then pizza pizza, gino's, Domino's"}
{"text":"I tried this place out. Ordered house special for hockey night with friends. Total let down. Burnt and like cardboard. Never going back."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet.  First of all, it has been there forever (45 years). Second, it is the best pizza in town. Literally. Third, this is a no-nonsense establishment. You want delivery? Too bad. You want a slice? Too bad. You want (insert gourmet ingredient here) on your pizza? Too bad.  What DPH does, and does extremely well, is make old-skool pizza. Pizza the way you dream it must have tasted in the old days. Pizza made by someone who really cares about it, and whose life has been spent perfecting that art.  My favourite part about the DPH pizza is the crust. The man takes great care in how long he cooks the pie, and I think that's critical. He usually cooks it so it is slightly black around the thin part of the edge of the crust. What this results in is a crust that is satisfyingly crisp on the outside, but gives way to a wonderful soft flavour inside. It is really a sensual experience biting into one of his pizzas.  Please try this pizza, while you can. And check out the old cash register while you are there,"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for the last 10 years and they hands down have the best pizza! They have recently done some renovations, and unlike many ma and pa places that change with the times they have maintained the integrity of the pizza they offer all the way down the sauce and cheese!. Also, the renovations look amazing. Love that they have an inviting place to sit down and eat in. Some may say the fact that the don't deliver is a pain, but truthfully their pizza is worth the drive to pick it up!"}
{"text":"No nonsense delicious local delivery pizza. Sure it's a bit more than Pizza Pizza but it's 10x as good!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a year consistently. The staff are nice and polite for the most part and the pie is really good. I've always had the house special which is great. I find that the pepperoni is not the best of quality. Also they put a decent amount of cheese but sometimes its not completely covered if your a cheese lover like me so I recommend double cheese. Unfortunately a large house special double cheese with two pop will cost you roughly $37. Overall great pie and good service."}
{"text":"BEST pizza in the city! I'm from Windsor which has the best pizza.  I've lived here for 12 years and I finally found a place that I can say is good in Toronto.  Must try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the pizza here, the dough is simply AMAZING!!! I promise you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Danforth Pizza House since the 70's  Old style pizza, and highly recommend it. I drive from the west end once in a while to get one."}
{"text":"Dear Danforth Pizza,  I know you brought your shop into this decade with new interior but why, why, why would you mess with the dough??  I love/loved the airy, thin, slightly chewy, air filled rim crust with your delicate, traditional toppings.  Now, it is thick rimmed, 'doughy/chewy' base crust. Pull out the old playbook because you are starting to look like all the rest ... who deliver and take plastic.   Soooooooooo soooo sad. Like so sad as trying to keep the trad alive but not sure I won't go to another pizza 'joint'"}
{"text":"I have been going to down for pizza for 20 years.  So I was very excited to meet the new owner and check out their pizza we ordered two medium pizza crust was very good cheese was done to nice color  we are going to pizza toppings but there was barely any was a long drive to get there and I was greatly disappointed from the old one or this one now I will never go back there again .  Also the owners there weren't very friendly"}
{"text":"This pizza was amazing, had the family with me, so we got two pies. Met the owner, he's been at this location for 43yrs. Most folks seem to call ahead and take it with them, we had parked around the corner so we used the trunk lid as the our table. Pies are made one-at-a-time, takes about twenty minutes; CLOSED SUNDAYS, we tried. No AC, so its hot in there, small selection of drinks from cooler (Coke available). Old school approach, old school result! Cash only! Give it a try while in Toronto, it will be a welcome change from mass produced cardboard served everywhere."}
{"text":"This was a total let down. I almost can't believe I ate at the same pizzeria as my fellow yelpers who previously reviewed Danforth Pizza House.  Me and my husband ordered the house special pizza. The pizza looked promising, but one bit and I was completely let down. The dough and crust was as tough as cardboard and burt! The cheese has no pull or gooey goodness to it. I took a bit and all the harden cheese would side off the pizza. This pizza was not better than a Pizza Pizza slice in my opinion (and that is not saying much) And it ran me $26.  I ate a leftover slice the next day and surprisingly it tasted a tiny bit better, but still really bad. I will never eat this pizza again, nor will I recommend this place to anyone. Horrible pizza in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nice family operated Pizza House that has been around for eons. Great place to grab food for the Only Cafe, a small little bar/hang out down the road, who let you bring in food from outside spots. Pizza ain't gourmet but is definitely tasty, cheap, and hits the spot. Very old skool place that only offers a small list of standard toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, Green Peppers, Tomatoes) and nothing extravagant. More of a take-out spot but they do have tables to eat in."}
{"text":"If you're after a good 'american style' pizza, Danforth Pizza House is it. You can taste the quality of the ingredients (sauce, cheese, dough). It's more expensive than a chain, but much better tasting.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been informed that Angelo has not passed away.  My apologies for any inconvenience."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from Danforth Pizza House because the set up is so out of the ordinary, but I really enjoyed the pizza I ordered. The Italian man who runs this place knows what he's doing.  First off, the dough is made from scratch and the toppings are fresh. And if you want to wait the 45-60 minutes (I didn't), it's all made right before your eyes. There's nothing fancy about the pizza and that's what makes it great. It's like something you would make at home, but even better.  The edges of the crust were a bit burned and the pizza was a bit greasy, but that didn't make it any less tasty. In fact, I think it tasted even better the following day.  I got a medium two-topping pizza for $16 and it was ready in about 45 minutes.  I say the place is out of the ordinary because the guy was basically making pizzas in the dark (the only light was the fading sunlight through the front window), he wrote my order down on a piece of ruled paper next to other orders that were illegible, the cash register is ancient (along with most of the kitchen/counter area) and the customer area is really barren.  I walked in to place my order, so I didn't have any problems with the phone. Cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Doesn't taste like big chain pizza at all. Tastes homemade with simple but great tasting sauce and lots of cheese.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza's you're gonna eat in Toronto.  I don't know what that awesome old guy does to these pies, I only hope he keeps doing it forever!"}
{"text":"This is the one time that yelp reviews really disappointed me.  I don't know how this one got such good reviews.  I ordered a large house special.  Yes it looked great and the crust was quite good, but that's where it ends.  The pizza was way overcooked, the sauce was way too sweet, the pepperoni was very small and bland, and the sausage tasted strongly of  juniper berries.  I HATE juniper berries!  After eating about 2 slices I ended up throwing away the rest.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Ok, Yes it's really Busy! Yes it's not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The boxes are plain white, there is no advertising, no chain, no delivery. It's not a first date restaurant, or really a place to eat in. But the pizza is by far one of the best in the eastend of the city. Domino's, Pizza Pizza, Diamond, Pizza Pizza, Pizzaville do not hold a candle to Danforth's Pizza.  I've been a regular here for about 25 years. I've never had a bad pie.  It's hard to get on Friday and Saturday nights because of yelp and urban spoon but it's really good pizza."}
{"text":"We previously loved Danforth Pizza House. We finally went by today since the change in ownership. We ordered a large pepperoni, bacon, and mushroom for $22. Normally my husband and I can just barely eat more than 1/2 but tonight we were able to finish the whole thing. The crust is still the same and the overall taste was still good, it just had about 1/2 the ingredients. I'm not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza edges were crispy, dough was airy with a slight chew. Friendly service. It's family owned and it's always nice to support a local business!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Montreal-style pizza in Toronto, look no further. Danforth Pizza is by far the best in the City.   Make sure you order early, as 45+ minute waits are not uncommon on busy days, though you can sit at the bar and watch the 80+ year old master pizza chef make your pizza if you want. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"It was a blessing that I lived just steps away from this place. It became apart of a weekend routine, ordering the small, house special. The only reason I'm sad about moving out of the Danforth is moving away from the Danforth Pizza House. Incredible staff, incredible pizza, and well worth the drive just to pick up some house special pie."}
{"text":"Good, simple pizzas. Crust was nicely done.  Different from the chain pizza places. Would recommend and definitely return."}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here sooner. Been in the area for years and never been in. I'm an idiot.  Placed order over phone Medium pepperoni,mushroom,green pepper extra cheese  Was ready as soon I as went in. Amazing all around."}
{"text":"Extra cheese, double pepperoni, extra sauce. A recipe for heaven.  Amazing old school pizza. I was worred when the former owner passed - it was just the old man with a pizza oven and little else - because his pizza was the real deal. But the folks who took over and rennovated have kept up the tradition and make a high-quality, damn good pizza. The old man would be proud."}
{"text":"I'm not often out in the East end, so when a comedy performance brought me and some chums out to the Danforth last week, I pulled out my handy Yelp app to guide us to a pizzeria that Chum One said he was told about by a friend of his. We read reviews for Danforth Pizza House, and decided it was the best candidate, so we headed over.  When we got there, the woman at the counter took our pizza orders (it seemed quite economical for the three of us to just order a small pizza each, and share slices). She scribbled it down on a piece of paper, as she occasionally pressed the button to hang up their phone -- which seemed to be intentionally left off the hook -- when it would begin to blare the dial tone, as phones off of hooks are wont to do.  The phone, by the way, was probably the most modern piece of equipment in there. I pointed to the ancient analogue cash register and quipped to Chum 1, \"I take it they don't do debit.\" Chum 1 laughed, but I think it was just because he recognized my joking tone and was being polite; we both knew that was a lazy half-joke on my part. I should have taken the time to think of something better.  Anyway, we were told they'd take about an hour. They took a little longer, but no biggie. About halfway through eating my black-olive/pineapple pizza (my go-to topping combination), I took a break to go to the bathroom, where my defining Danforth Pizza House moment would occur.  I'm going down the stairs, when I hear the unmuffled sound of a man's urination into a toilet. \"If the door is properly closed,\" I correctly surmised, \"I shouldn't be able to hear that.\" Sure enough, I get to the bottom of the stairs to see the chef/owner man doing his thing in the men's room, door fully ajar. Sure, his back is to me, but it's a private, one-toilet bathroom, clearly visible as soon as you reach the bottom of the stairs. Closing the door would take a minimal amount of effort (but then he'd also have to click on the light, which he also didn't do). I politely hang back, waiting my turn to use the washroom. Chef-man finishes up, dusts his hands off against his big chef apron a few times and leaves the bathroom. He turns around, sees me, gives a surprised, \"Oh!\", then continues up the stairs. YOU DIDN'T WASH YOUR HANDS! But he had already left the range of my psychic projection. The bathroom was not nearly on the clean side neither - that toilet rim couldn't have been cleaned in the last week, I'd guess.  Anyway, I didn't touch the rest of my pizza. Chum 1 and Chum 2 seemed not altogether turned off when I told them what I saw, but they can swim in their germ cocktail, for all I care! (That's not a nice thing to say about your chums, Andrew) (SHUT UP!)  How was the pizza? Definitely above the quality of most Toronto pizzerias. Probably in the top 10% for my palate. Definitely below Libretto though. To their credit, it's great to see such a genuine mom-and-pop, everything-handmade-in-front-of-you pizzeria. I'd have given four stars if I didn't witness what I think is an inexcusable sanitary violation.  Oh, how's this, this is better: I should have pointed to the old register and said, like, \"Where do I swipe my debit card in this thing?\" No, that's not great either. Forget it."}
{"text":"This place deserves an \"A\" for authenticity.  The great pizzas don't hurt, though.  This pizza is the real deal.  Solid, not fancy, but oddly memorable.    Why not eat in and try it right out of the oven?  Waiting a couple minutes with the pizza in front of you as it cools off is wonderful, exquisite torture.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try it out since we were in the neighborhood and it had mainly positive reviews.  Ok so yes it is a mom and pop type place, but man, this mom and pop are dirty!  You don't want to eat there.  Old, dark, kinda creepy and not clean.  No, no, no.  Got it to go and it was piping hot, smelled pretty good and didn't take very long, half hour tops.  Got home and found out that not only was the pizza (we got the house special) very bland, but the bottom of the crust was burnt.  I have had better pizza from a box and certainly didn't pay $26 bucks for it.  You can do better than Danforth Pizza House."}
{"text":"We tried calling to place an order but couldn't get through. So we walked over instead. This is when we discovered that the phone was purposely off the hook!  An older gentleman was the only one working and had a handwritten laundry list of pizza orders that were placed before ours. He told us it'd be 45 minutes - we returned in 50 minutes and the pizzas were ready to go!  The pizza was really good, worth the wait. If anything, a bit too greasy/cheesy for me, but quite tasty."}
{"text":"It was okay. Crazy pricey on Uber - 31$ for a pizza that costs 22 if you pick up. I had high expectations given the recent accolades from Now magazine (they listed DPH as one of the top 10 pizza places in Toronto). The dough was under-salted and bland. Not enough cheese. Nothing to write home about. Would not order again."}
{"text":"I can remeber eating here since I was 5.  I went on a long hiatus but have recently reintroduced myself.  what I remeber then was a clean cheesy fresh tomato sauce pizza with nice char bits.  amazing it's exactly how I remember it.  also found out the original owner had passed.  place is in good hands with the new ones.  simply the best clean fresh pizza in Toronto ."}
{"text":"It is awesome!  I called to ask if they delivered and he hung up on me...  as he is an older gentleman and I don't think he could hear.  So we went to pick it up and it was like going to an old school pizzeria the way it should be.  And the pizza was great- very fresh.  Definitely my favourite new find in pizza."}
{"text":"Really good basic old style pizza. Not gourmet just tasty and filling, and wonderfully simple menu if you are ok with the two meat choices bacon pepperoni and a small handful of veg toppings. They keep it simple, keep it cheap and bake it right. I believe the property and business is still up for sale so right now they are doing a great job to impress prospective buyers - may DPH continue for another generation of starved Torontonians. Try the House Special."}
{"text":"Just an update. Pizza is still delicious. But stingy on cheese unlike angelo who loaded it up.  So if ur a cheese lover get extra cheese (never did that b4). But will from now on.  Other then that the same old.  And the new owners are delightful and I'm glad they are there to carry on tradition ."}
{"text":"Danforth Pizza House is an institution and has been around for years. Located in a nondescript store near Donlands and Danforth, it's easy to pass by and not notice the place. They are so old school here it's amazing - the old cash register and seven-digit phone number painted on the glass window make you think back to simpler times.  We ordered a medium Danforth Special and the pizza came hot and fresh from the oven in about 15 minutes. In terms of toppings, there was bacon, mushrooms and peppers and we swapped the pepperoni for ham.  The pizza itself was very tasty and the cheese was perfectly browned, although the base was a bit burnt for my liking. Although the pizza was the perfect size for two people, there definitely could have been more toppings for the $20 we spent.  If I was rating this place for ambiance and nostalga alone, I'd give it five stars. The pizza itself should have been the star attraction, and although it was good it was really nothing to write home about. I would rate the pizza here above Pizzaiolo but below Libretto (just my opinion)."}
{"text":"I'm bumping my rating up to 5 stars! With the recent reno, it's perfect. The pizza recipe hasn't changed, though they've added some fancy-schmancy toppings to what was a very basic selection previously. I love that they kept some old signage to authenticate the 50 year history of this place, and they salvaged the portion of the front window that contained the old, fading signage. It looks great as a divider between the back prep area and the seating.   Live on for another 50 years, DPH!"}
{"text":"They use to be amazing but I was very disappointed tonight. I wonder if the new owners are skimping on the good stuff that made the pizza so incredibly. Where's the grease!!? might try once more than I am done with it. Sad, really. It's an iconic establishment."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Order in advance.  This guy has been making pizzas on the same oven for 42 years after he moved to Toronto from Italy.  He has perfected the medium thickness crust pizza!  It comes out hot crispy and chewy.  I love this pizza!"}
{"text":"Just had the most delicious pie from there today! I am from NYC so it's naturally tough to find good NY style pizza. This place totally succeeded. I got extra cheese which was terrific. Despite the place being a bit far from me (20 min by car), I'll be back for sure. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"FatCat go to Danfort Pizza with broken leg friend regularly many years ago.  FatCat like old man working in store. Old man not like talk to all customer - just some, and he make gooooood pizza.  Things FatCat like  - Simple and straight forward ordering  - Very fresh toppings   - Toppings that other pizza store not have  - Make for goooood pizza  Things FatCat not like  - One day FatCat go into store and see that old man turn himself into two young mans.  FatCat like magic, but FatCat want old man working back at store (RIP)."}
{"text":"I have to thank Yelp for leading me to this venerable pizzeria.  I don't like what it says about my biases that I have passed this joint literally thousands of times over the last decade without noticing it as it is right around the corner from me. Then again, its frontage looks like it has been fading since the day it opened in 1964.  The Danforth Pizza House is nothing less than a time machine back to much simpler era before debit or even credit cards, when pizzas were simpler and humbler.  There are ten ingredients available, and one type of crust: doughy and perfectly charred on the bottom.  I can't think of another restaurant in town that reminds me so strongly of the best pizzas from my childhood in Toronto, and I thank the owners for sticking to their guns all these years."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and from what I read in the other reviews, this place is fast going from amazing to becoming a has-been. Unfortunately new ownership can do that.  It is good pizza, and better than most, but not the best. I like how they bake the cheese on top, it reminds me of my home town Galt/Cambridge, a place called Andy's Pizza. I asked for thin crust and while it didn't look thin to me, they assured me it was thin. Personally, I feel good pizza belongs on thin crust and if you ask for thin, it should be thin as expected, not their version of thin. I agree with others here, I also found the toppings to be scarce. I order onion, pineapple, hot peppers, pepperoni and bacon. Generous with the cheese, tight on the toppings.  If I craved pizza I would go here but only  because they are the best we got in the east end. Toronto in general is  not a pizza town, most of it is crap...  Update... just had another pizza and except for the cheese nicely browned on top it was bland at best. If this place was good, it was before my time. I ordered onion, pineapple, hot peppers and peperoni. Can't remember tasking an onion or hot pepper, scarce on the toppings."}
{"text":"From the reviews I was expecting very good pizza. It was very OK. Add that the pizza is expensive and I can't recommend it. I mean, its better than pizza pizza, but that's not really saying much."}
{"text":"A local takeout pizza gem for decades, with a few tables for eat-in if you can't wait. A very rich pizza that puts the chains to shame."}
{"text":"Nice to see that things have not changed. Danforth Pizza House still makes a killer pizza, carrying on the traditions of its founder Angelo, in the hands of the new owners.  Change is happening, with a few new toppings, and it appears there is an actual dining area under construction, but as long as the pizza stays as good as it ever was, then bring on the change, I say!"}
{"text":"I have always  wanted to try it since Ive heard so much about it. Meh it was ok . Loved the atmosphere and  service but the pizza itself was ok , the garlic knots were hard like a rock and not what Im used to.I tried one and threw the rest out."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! grew  up in the area but never been here til today based on the reviews on yelp. I use to go to new york pizza on greenwood and danforth til they shut down in 2004 due to a divorce with his wife. The pizza house is amazing the best pizza in the east end. Nice chewy crust the sauce has a sweet taste to it great quality cheese. The owner has a gift and that's why he is  open for only a few hours with a small menu that shows you how good this place is with little  hours and items and he is still open lol it shows how good this place is.  just straight up pizza no slices, around 8 toppings. You have to try this place don't waste your hard earned money on pizza chains.  go to this local place that has been legendary since 1964."}
{"text":"BEST pizza on the Danforth. Been going for 25 years, worried that once it was sold it wouldn't be as good. Thank gawd we were wrong. It's just as good, if not better. That crust with just a bit of charring, the delicious sauce and cheese. Old school pizza doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I was recommended to try this pizza place from a friend. From the sign outside I didn't know what to expect, but the inside was very nicely done! A bit small, definitely mostly for take-out, but if you wanted to eat there with a group of friends you certainly could. The prices aren't crazy high and the selection of toppings is decent. Okay, to the pizza itself.... I didn't think the crust was mind-blowing, but I thought the ratio of toppings to crust was just about perfect. I've never eaten pizza in Italy, but if I had to guess, I'd say it was similar to this pizza. I guess that's a pretty big compliment! I regret not getting a dipping sauce for the crust though, because I found it to be quite bland once you ate through the toppings (and I'm normally a crust finisher). But I would definitely go back to try other topping combinations sometime!"}
{"text":"I Went in to buy some pizza today. I've never tried the place, but I'd heard good things, so I wanted to give it a shot. I walked into the joint and the guy who takes the order and his friend were sitting around the kitchen on their phones.   When I went to place my order they were pretty rude. I wasn't in the mood for the tude, so I walked out. First impressions count. I went to Big House pizza and gave them my money instead."}
{"text":"The pizza here really IS amazing.  So completely homemade old school style.  It has a real New York vibe, where the focus ain't on the sign or tables, just on the pies.  The ancient man that makes them is literally covered with flour from hand kneading the dough and tossing it fresh for every customer.  The sauce is delicious and tangy, crust is chewy, fresh and crispy on the outside.  The price is unreal, only 7 bucks for a small that could feed 2 people (and I can eat a lot of pizza!)"}
{"text":"I\"ll never visit this place again because they have no respect for a customers time.  Its like they cant be bothered because they have a following.  Complete arrogance.  I dont know how this place is stil in business considering it has by far the worst service ive ever encoutered.  They keep the phone off the hook basically forcing you to go to the place and then, if your lucky, the place is open!  Ive eaten here once and have gone to it around ten times.  They say they open at 3 yet ive been there at 4,5,and even 6 on a saturday and they were closed!  I think its completely disrespectful to treat customers who pay their bills like this.  If you say your open at 3 on a friday be open! If you have a phone answer it!  There is too much competition in the area(big house pizza, Bona, Queen Margherita pizza, Libretto) for me to waste time at this place,  they all make great pizzas too and treat their customers right."}
{"text":"This has become my favourite pizza in the east end. Everything is super fresh, the sauce is amazingly delicious, fresh and clean tasting. This is not European thin crust pizza, so if you prefer that, clearly go to Libretto (East End) or Famoso. The cheese on this pizza is immaculate, generous and gets that fantastic browning on the top making it even better. The crust is chewy and very good. Toppings are not ridiculously diverse like some placed but no issues with that and they are all good and fresh.  They also have renovated and what was once a dirty looking hole in the wall is now a re-done very nice place, looking beautiful and clean.  My only complaint is that they do not deliver. While that hurts, it is definitely worth the trip.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place and I'm glad my friend and I gave it a try!   We ordered a two topping medium pizza with two glass bottled drinks and the total came up to $25 which was a very good deal for the taste and quality of the pizza! My favourite is the sauce that caught my tastebuds. Overall, the pizza just tastes like home, something your grandma would make that no other pizza can't top it.   Another pro about this place is the fantastic customer service. They greet and welcome you once you walk in and made great conversation.   There is also a lot of dining space, so this is perfect for a romantic date, hangout with friends or just eat by yourself!   TIP: they only take cash!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Angry Bee. There was lots of promise with all of the great sounding ingredients mentioned in the menu, however, we were let down. There was an overpowering spice that dominated the fennel sausage and pretty much all the other ingredients. Our spice tolerance is very high but unfortunately the chilli on this pizza coated our mouths. The texture of the pizza was great and there were lots of toppings.   I'll give it another try but won't order this type again."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten pizza here, you're living life in the dark. Gooey, melty, perfectly browned cheese on a beautiful crust hot from the oven...I'm dying here.   Make me a pizza, Angelo. Make me a pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in one time while wandering the Danforth. Was surprised that it seemed like we stepped into a time machine back to the 70's, the place looks as old as it is, but the staff is very nice. We ordered a pizza and waited for it to be made and cooked, man was it good. I don't think they do any delivery (which is ok, as we live in Scarborough, far from what would be the delivery area) but this was a real mom and pop pizza, much much better than anything you would get at any of the chains, the reason I bring up delivery, because this pizza was so good I would order every night if I could."}
{"text":"The biggest problem with places like DPH is that they have been around for so long, get so much business day in and day out, have such a strong loyal clientele already, that they stop caring and treat customers with indifference, as they take their business for granted.  I said....places like DPH, definitely NOT DPH itself!!!   And that's why it is now one of the best Pizza places in the GTA for me, definitely in the top 3. They are as busy as they can possibly be for a Friday/Saturday evening, wait times are anywhere between 40 minutes to around an hour for your order to be ready, tickets are piling up..........behind the counter everyone is working hard, yet calm and relaxed, and still friendly to all customers. You are not rushed to order, they pay attention to you, tell you about the wait times in advance, they don't act like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld...overall you are treated well.  The entire time we were there waiting for our order, we must have witnessed countless pizzas coming out of the oven, each and every one of them looked amazing, tempting, and appetizing. The pizzas are New York style, NOT thin crust....if that's what you're looking for, and not thick crust either. The crust is delicious with some crunch to it, slices hold their own, toppings and meats seem to be of high quality. The quantity of toppings per portion is also perfect, cheese....just the right quantity.  Best part about the DPH pizzas.......heat them up the next day in a conventional oven....just as good!!..unless you burn them....but that's on you."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic, extremely friendly people - great customer service!"}
{"text":"This will be quick since there's not too much to add over my fellow Yelpers - just some quick tips:  1) Bring cash - their register is from the stone age and debit/credit card machines were no where in sight. The prices are flat rate though - $20 for a large 2 topping.  2) Do a walk by. Seriously if you're not in the area don't bother. They're notoriously bad with the phones apparently  3) Be prepared to wait an hour for your pizza. They only have one stove.  4) GET THE BACON. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET THE BACON!!!"}
{"text":"Great crust and always with a thick browned cheese layer.  Delicious!  ...and friendly people!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place out. The pizza is good and all of the staff seemed really friendly, making conversation with the patrons even though they were super busy. I knew there would be a wait when I walked in to order but I was thinking 30 minutes. It turns out they told me it would be an hour. There is only one oven, they should purchase another. The moral of the story is call to order ahead as there is really no place to wait around without being in the way.  The pizza is not what I usually order. I like thin crust and lightly baked. This was still great, though. The crust had a great chew and a little crispness. The edges were burned to char, though, which doesn't appeal to me much. The pepperoni was a little sparse for the premium price tag. I almost ordered extra cheese because I do everywhere else, but the $3.00 extra charge on a medium stopped me. Thank God. There is a ton of cheese on this pizza naturally which I'm sure plays a big part in why their prices are jacked up. The cheese seems to be some large chunky curds, not the typical shreds. It melts into a thick chewy layer of greasy love.   The prices are obscene for a takeaway pizza place without a wood oven. I paid $13.50 for a medium pepperoni which could be had at most any other take away in the city for $5. I think $10 would be more justified. I'm glad I spent the money for the opportunity to eat at such a neighbourhood landmark but it's not something I'd be willing to drop money on regularly. It just wasn't that much better than everywhere else."}
{"text":"After many years in the neighbourhood, I finally tried this place on Saturday night.  I wish I had been able to try the old owner's pies but these are still amazing.  We went with a large with black olive, peperoni and mushroom.  I felt like the amount of toppings and cheese was fair.  I think I would like to try the extra cheese option next time but my guess is that this pizza is pretty true to what pizza was back in the day---before everything got extreme and things like \"Meat Lover's Pizza\" were invented.  OK, getting to the dough/crust--everyone talks about this and for good reason.  It really is amazing.  Soft, chewy--seems like just the right consistency.  I'd go back just for this reason.  Somebody's review suggested that this was a \"thin\" crust pizza.  I can't agree.  In my mind this is a fairly medium to thick crust.  No wings, no BS dipping sauces, no crust styles, no complexity.  I love that the choices are limited here although now there are basic toppings and gourmet toppings.  I guess you have to keep up with the times, right?  It is fun to sit at the \"bar\" (this place is not licensed) and watch the experts at work--given how many pizzas are going in and out of the oven, there is no doubt how good or loved this place is in the 'hood.  No delivery.  I live just far enough that a walk home would ensure a warm pie at best.  We solved this with a taxi ride but next time I want to eat it there.  (But our $24 pie was now $32.)  \"There\" means that there are just a couple of tables if that.  This is very much a take-out spot.  Very recommended.  And if you are just a short ride or walk away, consider yourself VERY lucky."}
{"text":"This tiny little establishment in which you can see through the window or inside the old man slaving away on the many pizzas being ordered is dainty. It is old and hot and in serious need of some restaurant makeover. But this place is far from being in any kind of trouble.   Famous for their traditional pizza, no gourmet items just the bare essentials. And word is that if the old man is taking your order, you get 3 tries to place a correct order or else he tells you to vamoose. No delivery, no slices, just one size pizza for take out. Okay, if you want to eat in, there are a few tables with sketchy looking chairs.   But this place is known for the way their pizzas taste and I gotta say, it completely impressed me. I'm not a big pizza eater, so when I eat a good pizza and want to go back for more, you know it's amazing.   It is a little out of the way since I'm rarely in the Danforth area and when I am it's always west of Pape and not east. It is a great pizza but I'd probably only come here maybe a few times a year since it's quite the lengthy drive or transit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's truly a neighbourhood gem and has now become a regular place for us to order pizza. This family run restaurant has been around for over half a century and serves a more old school pizza that will blow your socks off. Fresh ingredients with amazing flavours from the sauce to the fresh dough. Their menu is simple and of great value for the quality. Don't expect thin crust pizza as you would in most other top pizza places in Toronto, expect something closer to a New York style pizza.   Before us discovering this place, they did a beautiful renovation and kept some of their old signs which looks great!   Service is great and the owners are more often there than not. Great business!  Also note, Prices are cheaper at the restaurant than if you order on UberEATS."}
{"text":"Simply Beautiful! I think I am selling my house and going to move into the neighbourhood nearby and  um, well....you understand."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!  This is seriously simple, amazing and cheap pizza. You literally have to look twice to find the spot. They don't even have an illuminated sign anymore, so look twice.   This is the epitome of old school pizzeria. There's a mountain of pizza boxes, a beautiful espresso machine, a fridge full of Brio and a cash register that rang in the first purchase of the Gutenberg Bible. People have commented on the owner being grumpy but I think it's more that he's concentrated on putting out quality product.   The product is a thing of beauty. The perfect blend of crust that is firm and the right amount of char, yet can support a mountain of bubbly cheese without becoming a grease napkin (see Mama's Pizza).    This is also a highly addictive product, as you can easily gorge an entire pizza in one sitting. Makes excellent leftovers the next day, if there's any left. I'd recommend the Hawaiian with bacon."}
{"text":"I have to say maybe I just don't get good pizza but this place was just 'okay'. It was good pizza don't get me wrong but nothing that everyone makes me think I need to trek out here for! The ingredients are very normal, there are only a few toppings you can order and the prices are okay. The sauce is authentically italian and the crust is 'meh'.  It's your standard home-made pizza and honestly the only great thing about Danforth Pizza House is the amazing 80-90 year old man making everything by himself behind the counter. I almost wanted to go over there and hug him... but I probably would have crushed his bones.  Also, don't even think about sitting down here, your best bet (if you have a car) is to order it in advance and head on over to the beach and sit on the boardwalk and have the pizza!  It was nice to try it out but I really doubt I'll be back again.  OH and most importantly: CASH ONLY (have a look at their register in the pictures)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the smallest and sketchiest pizza places I've been to. Although, not as small as Bitondo's it is much sketchier as the place is empty, sticky counters, chairs are worn and plastic, and paint peeling from the walls.  You are greeted by a grumpy old man needing dough and throwing pizzas together that looks like he just stepped out of Naples. The cashier lady is super nice and makes up for the less than charming older fella.  Here's the goods, the pizza is phenomenal. I wouldn't classify it as traditional pizza but it is definitely a New York style pizza made with a lot of care. To me it's the perfect balance of traditional pizza and New York style pizza, just in between my two favorite styles. I would definitely call ahead to place your order as the wait time could be 45mins. Go for the house special and you won't be disappointed. Crust is crisp and slightly chewy, sauce is simple but flavorful, and the cheese is just the right amount.  Overall the prices are fantastic for the quality New York style pie you get. I recommend taking out and eating elsewhere. A bit of a bummer that they don't do delivery but the trek along Danforth should make for a good story.  Note: No slices, pizzas here can only be bought by the pie and they are HUUGE so bring hungry friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Fresh ingredients, well baked. The crust was light and crispy. And just as delicious heated up the morning after!"}
{"text":"It's not all that.  Good pizza but far from great. The crust dough is too chewy and the tomato sauce is bland. The price is low, that much is true. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this pizza."}
{"text":"just went know to it.For small pizza with 2 topping $15.00 dollars.i go little cards pizza get 3 them for that price.pizza good enough for $2 15.dollars.I miss old guy.he was Best .Am done going there Danforth Mooney to spend thetr"}
{"text":"Super!! My husband loves Pizza, and this is one of the most popular places in the city so I decided to take him here this Friday.  Parking was easy, found a spot right outside the restaurant. They have a beautiful sign outside which will definitely catch your eye. I think it's a family run business, and everyone is very nice and welcoming. When we entered the restaurant it was very busy and they told us that wait times are around 50 mins. We decided to wait. They have some seating in the restaurant and because we live very far we decided to eat in the restaurant. We ordered a DPH Special and one Margherita both in 12'. We got our order after almost an hour wait but let me tell you both the pizza's were worth the wait. They don't have thin crust pizza's but their regular crust is nice and crisp. All the toppings were fresh, and they put cheese generously on your pizza. Portion was huge, we couldn't finish the whole thing and brought one pizza back (half DPH and half margherita). All in all loved it!!  We will definitely go their again but I guess we will just order in advance to save ourselves from the wait."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big fuss is about this place, this is a descent-good pizza joint but absolutely nothing to rave about. They did put so much cheese in comparison to toppings that I could pretty much only taste cheees. I personally like a lot of cheese on my pizza but the the amount of other toppings were way too mediocre. For the price they charge you can find higher quality pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Absolutely one of the best pizzas here.  Dont miss out!"}
{"text":"I will never step in to this place again.  I was a customer when the original owner ran the business and loved it.  My visit with the new owner was full of negativity and far from welcoming.  The pizza is mediocre under new management.  Save yourself a few bucks and avoid."}
{"text":"After a few years of living in the East End this has defenitely become our go to pizza joint. The handmade dough is delicious and chewy. The brown crispy mozzarella on the top is probably the best part. And the amount of toppings are generous. We usually get the House Special as it has a great mix of meat and veggies. The veggies really bring some freshness to the pizza. I've noticed they've for some new pizza and toppings to try which I haven't tried yet but I'm sure it's all delicious.  Also I love the new sign. It really lifts up the area."}
{"text":"Tasty from the chewy crust to the sweet sauce Just pleasure to savor 6 hours later still full from over indulgence Not too many of these pizza joints left anymore glad to have one close to home"}
{"text":"No menu. No price list. Zero ambiance. But delicious pizza that took me back to my childhood when pizza wa less complicated - pre-Gourmet Pizza era, no caramelized onions here.  Excellent crust and browned cheese, my deluxe with extra cheese was cooked properly and was tasty.   The gentleman behind the counter was a little crusty (no pun intended) with my initial questions about what kinds of pizzas were available and the sizes, then he just asked me what I wanted on it. He soon warmed up and was very friendly and cordial.  I've now been here a few times.  Bring cash (I doubt they take credit) and lots of PATIENCE.  Is the \"Fast Take Out Service\" painted on the window a joke??!!  Even calling in advance doesn't seem to help.  I've had to wait every time.  But it's damn fine pizza."}
{"text":"I decided on grabbing a small pepperoni. Warning the small was about 12\". Way larger than I thought but great bang for your buck. It was only if I remember correctly $12.50. The crust was cooked perfectly. It was nice and crisp on the bottom and it had a great chew to it. They didn't skimp on the toppings either. Hard to see the pepperoni due to the top coating of cheese but there was plenty on top. The cheese was also nice and stringy with a great flavour! It's like it had a bit of a bite to it. Different but I loved it.   I will definetly be back but I think the small was way too big for myself. They offer \"baby\" pizzas which looked perfect for lunch. They are pre-made and they had a variety of toppings on them. I believe they were $6"}
{"text":"If you like paying 18 bucks for thick bland crust with virtually no toppings, this is the place! Went in for a quick bite today, asked for margherita and coke with ice. Apparently ice is a commodity now, as I was told by the owner, 'we don't keep any special stuff in here'. Ok. What's better than a warm coke.  Waited mb 10-12 minutes, so that was ok. But the pizza... Had no salt or any oil. Dry tasteless crust. Mozzarella covered about 15% of the so called pie (they call pizza a pie there).  To paint a more vivid picture, imagine that your hand is a slice of pizza. Put a dollar on it. That's how much cheese you will get.  Two basil leaves, viciously torn in two pieces, reminded me of basic math. And orphans.  This pie fell under the ruling of a mighty gluten king; dough without taste or toppings does not deserve to be called a pizza."}
{"text":"A nice family run establishment that I would love to give a higher grade, but the pizza simply isn't that great.  The cheese is consistently rubbery and over-cooked.  The sauce and crust are decent, but nothing special.  I don't think they're exactly tracking down the best or most fresh ingredients.  Toronto still needs to step up its pizza culture and learn a thing or two from NYC."}
{"text":"Danforth Pizza, Danforth Street, 3/16/10  After a busy day which started with Little Belly meeting her heroes, the Yo Gabba Gabba crew in person, followed by a brisk run through the Toronto Necropolis and Riverdale Park (a zoo right in the same park as the cemetary. Bellyman loves Toronto!), Belly Family needed food. When hungry, worn down and ready to collapse, what better food than pizza to restore a family and fuel Belly Family for a night of sightseeing?  Bellyman can't think of one...  Yelp once again provided the answer in the form of Danforth Pizza. Bellyman has had pizza in cities all around North America, and has to say: Danforth Pizza is THE most unique place he's ever been to. First, there's the owner. Bellyman thinks he's about 80 years old. He works alone most nights, churning out pizzas one at a time. For some reason, he leaves the lights off, so it's tough to know if he's open (Belly Family thought he was closed when we passed by, but the Yelp reviews said to give it a shot anyway). He makes pizza, and that's it. Small, medium and large with about 10 toppings. Bellyman was surprised to see pineapple on the list, but Canada's a liberal country. Maybe it's rubbed off on this crusty old Italian.  The pizza, though, is the star of the place. The owner might just be an odd fellow, but he knows how to make one hell of a pizza. He's obviously been doing it forever and is a master of his craft. Bellyman has worked in a pizza place, and has never seen a person man an oven so perfectly. Every pizza came out with the consistency of a machine. But, Bellyman digresses...one day, when in Philly, Bellyman will review for you Charlie's Pizza. Bellyman grew up on Charlie's Pizza, and always makes sure to visit at least once when there. Bellyman misses Charlie's Pizza a whole lot, and if he moved to Toronto with Belly Family, would miss it more.  Danforth Pizza would fill that void.  The pizza was a masterpiece of the trade. The crust was crispy, but risen. It wasn't limp and flat, it had heft to it. It could stand on its own, so Mrs. Bellyman didn't need to embarrass Bellyman by folding it (even though she still did). The cheese...how does Bellyman describe it? It was some odd extruded variety, it looked in the bin like packing peanuts! But, when it melted, it was gooey and crispy on top and....the sauce was just about the right amount of sweet and spicy, although a LITTLE over on the sweeter side. Noticeable, but not distracting.  About the only thing Belly Family did not like was the pepperoni. That, however, was not the fault of Danforth. Canadians have a weird thing about pork products in that they have no idea what they're doing with them. :) I still love them, though! The pepperoni was thin and floppy, not thick and greasy and fattening like Americans like it. Oddly enough, though, that wasn't enough to stop Belly Family from finishing off a whole medium in about 15 minutes.  Verdict: Stop what you're doing right now, get your passport (go get one if you haven't got one) head to Toronto and try this pizza. Bellyman knows you won't be disappointed! Make sure you have cash, though. Bellyman doesn't think the owner knows what credit cards are, let alone would he take them. His cash register? Bellyman can only describe it thusly: click, click, click, KACHUNK, wizzzz, BING!"}
{"text":"All the signs point to Danforth Pizza being my kind of place.  The storefront is uninviting and nondescript. As you approach you're convinced that it's not just closed but completely abandoned. You try the door and are surprised to find that it opens.  Inside things look just as deserted. There's not a single light on in the whole place and the ancient espresso machine and cash register makes it feel like you've entered a time warp.  As your eyes adjust, a women appears out of the darkness to take your order. She's amazingly warm and friendly and suggests a medium pizza for two people ($15 with 3 toppings). The menu is simple - no gourmet toppings here. We decide to eat in for the full experience.  The pizza is made by a small old Italian guy. He's not the talkative type but he's friendly enough and you can tell he's made thousands of pizzas in his day. In about half an hour our pizza is ready and is delivered to the table by the old guy.  I love everything about the experience and wish I could say I love the pizza. It is certainly good pizza but not excellent. Nothing about it really blows me away. The simplicity of the pizza is comforting and it puts a smile on my face knowing places like this exist.   If I lived in the neighbourhood I would come here often but for a west ender I don't think it's worth the trek across town. Except maybe once, just for the experience."}
{"text":"I came here with my assistant a couple of months back. She was Korean and she loves pizza. I hearts great reviews about this place so we decided to check it out. I was vegetarian that month so I got veggies on my half and my assistant got meat. The pizza was delicious, perfect amount of cheese and veggies. The crust was good enough for the restaurant to not carry dip.  It was the perfect pizza, will go again soon."}
{"text":"For those who remember this place under the old ownership, the components seem to be the same, however the final product has changed slightly. The taste is the same, but yes, the quantity of ingredients is more similar to what you'll get at any other pizza joint. No more heaps of expensive cheese.  So, order extra cheese (yes, I expect you'll have to pay for it).   I believe the new ownership may be struggling with the fact that the old ownership never really updated their pricing to reflect the cost of the materials. I always wondered how they could sell a pizza so cheap with so much cheese on it. Cheese is by far the most expensive component of a pizza, and I think the old man probably lost money on the generous amounts he used to use.  I sure do miss the old man's creations, but honestly the new owners deserve a break. They are trying very hard, I believe, to carry on the tradition of these magical pies. I would personally advise them to raise the price of each pie, and add the extra cheese without being asked.  I just tried one last night, and I will be buying 'za there again, but I had to dock a star from my previous 5 as it's just not the same; so close it hurts, but not the same. I wish I could do 4.5 stars.  If you loved the old pies, do give these folks a chance. Still a fantastic pizza.  Oh and for some reason it bothers me that the pies are all perfectly round, and no longer the misshappen oblongs the old man used to make. Never even knew I cared about that until I saw a new one, all symmetrical ... hardly burnt (although still wonderfully well-done just as always!)  Just order extra cheese, is all."}
{"text":"Elliott and I literally ate a large pizza yesterday.  This guy has a hollow leg.  Maybe both of them are hollow.  It was a lot of pizza.  Danforth pizza house is old and has no decorations and they make everything from scratch.  The owner has been the owner for 50 years and his son has been working there for 15 years.  I have a feeling not much has changed :)  The good: - cheap prices, and everything is on the whole number.  There is no $7.95 here - it's either $7 or it's $8.  - The cash register is really cash only.  I think it was an antique when they opened 50 years ago. - The guys who work here are great - The pizza is good  The bad: - limited seating (we sat at the bar which was awesome) - no slices (I can kind of see why) - I wish my pizza was cooked 1 or 2 minutes less and it would have been very close to the best I've ever had  I will DEFINITELY come back here again.  These guys do one thing, they do it well and it's a really charming family business that will be getting more of my business."}
{"text":"An institution in Toronto.   @owner Don't ever change the recipe please. Quality pizza here!  Recommend : Extra Sauce / Extra Cheese / Pepperoni / Mushroom / Onion"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place in the east end. I don't care they do not deliever, it is worth zipping up to the Danforth. Perfectly chewy crust, excellent sauce, and ample toppings. Last time we went for double cheese, double pepperoni. So perfect for a movie night a home with the kids."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Definitely would recommend I just tried the DPH special pie.  It was fantastic ! Cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"I grew up on Danforth Pizza. When I found out Angelo (RIP) had passed away I thought I would never eat pizza again as I've come to know a good quality pizza. Happened to be driving by when I saw the new sign and it was a sign for me to go and give it a try. I did and was I happy, Angelo's legacy lives on by way of the new ownership and how they execute his precise way of old school Italian pizza. Angelo must be smiling down from that big pizza pie in the sky"}
{"text":"I am so happy that my partner found this place - now we go every other week. Never have I found a pizza place that only uses the freshest quality ingredients and puts so much TLC into their pizza dough making. The angry bee is by far my favorite however I will be happy to eat any of their pizzas. Plus, what I enjoy the most is that the owner, Christos and his family that all work there are such genuine folks. We have no issues driving all the way to Danforth for pizza night!!!  Ps if you have a sensibility to bloating after eating pizza, Danforth Pizza House will surprise you!"}
{"text":"Good old fashion style Pizza.  Simple with simple ingredients. Its one of few places I have been for good old fashion PIE!  The old Italian pizza maker has the touch. Been there many times and will be going back.  ENJOY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying, I miss Angelo. God rest his soul.  The new family are doing a good job. But Angelo will always be that Star missing.  It's good folks. Keep it simple and order the cheese, well done and enjoy."}
{"text":"Look, the pizza is good however I can't say I'm not a little disappointed based on the expectations I had from the 4.5 star rating!  Pluses: - Crust is nice and chewy - Pizza overall tastes good, though the sauce is a little bland - Decent amount of toppings (we got the House Special), not overloaded by any means - Price - medium house special was 16.50 tax in, which was a reasonable amount of food for 2 guys and one girl, not tons though  Minuses - the wait at 7:45pm on a Thursday was 50 minutes (luckily Yelp prepared us for that) - the pizza did not look like the one used for the profile pic (eg. that one appears to be just overloaded with cheese and toppings... was there double cheese on that?)  Overall I would go there again if its convenient.  Also, I'd give it another try to see whether I just got a mediocre pizza (for them) on the day we ordered."}
{"text":"Since moving to the east side, finding a good pizza place has been a bit troublesome. Most are a bit over priced, a little too flat, a little too doughy, sauce is mediocre. But I must say, after consulting yelp, this place is pretty good. The tips on here are crucial.  Double cheese well done.  Add anything you want, but always DCWD.   The dough needs a little bit more time. I've had it reg and well done is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"The pizza upskirt on the slices here is otherworldly. Like, holy hotness. Don't know what a pizza upskirt is?? Apparently it's a phenomenon, as documented here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/slice/sets/72157594433032104/  Even if you know the address you'll walk straight past it, I promise. It's a totally shy and unassuming spot along the Danforth that's absolutely no fuss. No slices here. No zany toppings or weekly specials - just no nonsense pies and your choice of pop, water or Brio to drink. That's it. Call ahead to place your pickup order or dine in if you like, but it's cramped in here. There's no delivery, but you won't mind making the trek so you can see your pizza go from dough ball to flattened disc to all dressed, baked and gooey. You can watch every stage as it's happening.   I wanna scream the following at you in all caps, but for sanity purposes I won't (but just picture it):   An entire small pizza.  Made from beginning to end (~15-20 minutes) before your very eyes. By a father and son team since the 1960s.  For $7.  INCLUDING TAX.  Not a joke. Add toppings for $1 each - even if you add mushrooms, tomatoes and green peppers you're still looking at $10 flat. You can't get a Dominoes or P-squared for that little, and this shit's coming to you fresh off the battello.  On my third or fourth visit I got misty-eyed when I talked to \"the mom\" and literally held back tears as I asked:   \"How can your prices be so low? They're TOO low. You could charge the double. Please let me pay you an extra dollar or two. The cost to labour ratio is out of whack. How can you guys thrive?? I don't ever want you guys to stop making me pizza. Please don't ever leave me.\"   Special yelper appearance/run-in by Kit C, who when asked \"Oh, have you been here before?\" replied \"Yes, just last week for the first time. I couldn't stop thinking about it.\"  I just can't get you outta my head, Danforth Pizza House.  NOTE: Please note the opening hours. You can't call/show up here five minutes before close (they probably won't answer anyway) given the pizza-making process and expect to get in."}
{"text":"Great hot, fresh pizza at this mom and pop joint. Limited topping options, but it think that works well with this kind of no-nonsense pizza place. A medium pizza is more than enough for 2 people. Sauce is great, seems very homemade-ish - doesn't have much of a salty taste to it.  The only 2 downsides I see with this place: -crust is a bit too thick for my liking -not a wood oven pizza, so it doesn't have that same flavour.  Oh, and bring cash - I don't think they accept debit/credit. I'm not 100% sure though."}
{"text":"It took me a while to try this loved pizza. Not because I won't do just about anything for good pizza, but because it's cash only, doesn't deliver and is east of the ditch. However, even those obstacles couldn't keep me away forever!   Last night I took my little lady to visit my friends' even littler lady, and we made the pops (Hi Rob K, of Yelp infamy) go grab the 'za. It wasn't cheap, but we over ordered. It was delicious. I highly recommend The One & Only and the House Special."}
{"text":"Amazing old school pizza!  Had the House Special, substituted tomatoes for green peppers, and the large easily fed 3 of us with leftovers.  Generous toppings, really nice crust (regular, not thick or ultra thin... like I said old school!)  This is my new go-to in the Riverdale/ Leslieville area.  D"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, I loved the atmosphere. It smelled great! I only wanted to see the menu, but I wound up picking up my dinner to go. A small pizza is way more than one person really needs, but who doesn't love pizza for breakfast the next day? And the pizza was pretty tasty. The garlic knots were amazing. I'd go back just for those, but it would be really nice if they began to accept debit or credit. It's extremely inconvenient to have to go and get cash just to get a pizza."}
