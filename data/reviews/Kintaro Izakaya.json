{"text":"I've been to kintaro several times and I love the food there. However, as of lately the menu has been on and off. Many items have been removed and on my last visit half of the things were unavailable... I was very disappointed. 

I mean the loblaws and lobo is less than 5 minutes away and they are open till 11pm (loblaws) daily. I don't see how you could run out of anything?

I probably won't be coming here much anymore."}
{"text":"A little bit pricy compared to the food. We went there for pre Christmas dinner. Most food on the menu are deep fried skewers. No sashimi or rolls. We ordered some skewers. They were just ok as I cannot even remover what I ate that night. Also had the beef and tuna tataki. They were good."}
{"text":"Best takoyaki I've had in a really long time. The atmosphere is really great too - dark tasty Japanese drinking / eating hole. Will return!"}
{"text":"There are very few places in Toronto that have true authentic charcoal grilling seen in Tokyo and you can definitely taste that delicious carbon flavor in the meat.

That being said, it is quite pricey for what it is (about $5/2 skewers).  Additionally, would suggest going for the off the norm meats- chicken gizzards, etc as it is good to try something new.  

Do not opt for the cooked foods, as their strong point is definitely their charcoal grilled food.  I was unfortunately tempted into getting the gyoza chicken wings- not worth it at all.  The flavours did not meld and the chicken skin was not crispy enough to redeem the bland flavour of the dumpling."}
{"text":"We landed there for a late food craving. Service was good. Skewers were okay and their okonomiyaki were good."}
{"text":"Service is always a bit too slow for just a table for two and prices are pricer than surrounding restaurants I find. There isn't much that brings me back to this place."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Food, staff and music cool. Can't wait to come back and try more goodies."}
{"text":"I've decided to not return after experiencing rude staff a few times, but primarily because my friend had to send their undercooked meat back. The staff seemed indifferent and unapologetic, telling her that it was supposed to be like that. Wrong! It 100% was not supposed to be a potential salmonella nightmare or worse!
KINKA IZAKAYA, about a block away, has a far better atmosphere, and I've never feared for my health there, lol."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night because Kingyo was closed, and I was curious to find out what's the buzz about this place. As a result, disappointed.

There were two servers, the Japanese one was awesome like most other Japanese servers in town. But the Korean one was a bit too cool to be a server. There's no impoliteness or anything, and he's cute; but he just generally seemed not care enough and had almost no smile. After a while, including tasting the food, we were certain that this place is owned by Korean (it's not a big deal until you serve korean food under Japanese names).

Ankimo:  It was about normal quality, but the quantity was quite a nice surprise.

Sime Saba: It was okay as well, about the same quality as most places. Only one thing was the \"sashimi soy sauce\" they used were not the sweet ones specially made for sashimi like most places that have the same price range as them. It was a bit too salty for light tasted dishes like this.

Set B Yakitori: Good. I think their chicken skewers are better than Zakkushi ones. It's well marinated and cooked, smelled awesome and very juicy. The beef skewer was also really good, quality beef, light but tasty. The pork was good as well, although I didn't like the giant green onion. Asparagus Bacon wrap was decent quality, and the scallop was okay.

Sashimi: Almost the worst we've had in a la carte places, trust me, we are serious about sashimi and we know what we are talking. For the first thing, if you are charging 19.5 for 12 pieces salmon, tuna, and scallop at least pick the better quality parts and serve them fresh. This is really ridiculous, Ja Bistro and Kingyo are charging 50 a tray, but that's a much bigger tray with fresh and rare fish. Most places charge these most ordinary fish at about $1/piece and they are fresh. To be honest, I have just been to Dragon Legend (AYCE), its buffet serves about the same quality sashimi.

Momo Mochi: Very good. Crispy mochi with well tasted and juicy chicken, yum. But I don't think you should call it mochi in the menu if you are serving korean rice cake/dok.

Uzura Bacon: I loved this dish at Zakkushi, of course I will give it a try here. It was a mistake. The chef just didn't pay any attention to this dish in my opinion. It's hard to ruin a bacon dish, and he did it. The bacon was not raw, but it's also not well cooked and crispy like regular bacon. And there's no flavour, meh.

*I wouldn't be upset if a place simply not making good food to my expectation. I will stop going to a place if I deemed people are not paying attention to the food they served because they don't care. *

Chicken Gizzard: it was between okay and good.

If you think about it, 1/3 of its yakitori menu was chicken, 1/3 was bacon, and 1/3 others. Although the chicken dishes were great, it's really a big deal if you ruined one bacon dishes because they basically taste the same. And this place is seriously overpriced, cold raw tofu dishes are charged $7-11, what are you thinking?"}
{"text":"Very wide selection of tasty sushi. Try the spicy Vegas sushi. I visit the place every other weekend."}
{"text":"Friday night at 9 pm. My friend and I decided to check out a different Izakaya we have never tried before. After searching on yelp to see which one is closest to my house, Kintaro Izakaya came out on top.

When we arrived, only the Bar is available as every other table has customers, that's a good sign. When we sat down, we started with a couple of Asahi Black. Love the beer! - only downside is they didn't provide us with chilled glass for the beer, not a big deal though as the beer itself was ice cold.

Onto the main event, we ordered the following: Cheese Mune, Tori Nankotsu, Uzura Bacon, Gyusagari, and Ika Teriyaki (all pictures can be found online).

I have to say, the dining experience was not really up to par in comparison to other Izakaya places that I have been to.

1. Cheese Mune - they use Chicken Breast underneath the cheese... Chicken was really dry.
2. Tori Nankotsu - the cartilage is a little 'chewier' than we used to - according to my friend.
3. Uzura Bacon - The Quail Eggs were excellent, but the bacon was not. It seems to me that they used half the amount of bacon in comparison to their picture on the menu.
4. Gyusagari - this is perhaps the worst as the meat is more raw than I am used to. The inside of the beef tenderloin is closer to rare...
5. Ika Teriyaki - The grilled squid was quite nice, but the teriyaki sauce is too salty.

This Izakaya's price is also a little higher than the other Izakaya's that I am used to. I didn't even order Karaage! - $15 dollar?? Ebi Mayo for $11 dollar? that's almost twice the price than what I normally pay at similar places.

I don't think I will recommend anyone to come here as there are other better selections in Toronto. 

I will most likely not re-visit this place myself either."}
{"text":"Had Kintaro Ramen, Yakatori Set A and Beef don for under $40.
Portion was great, ramen and soup was comparable with Sansotei (my favorite ramen restaurant downtown). Really like the dressing of a small salad that came with the beef don.

The quality is not the best, but good value for the price.
Also, not alot of ppl on a sunday night, hesitated as it was empty when we walked in at 7pm... But it was a good choice, left the restaurant full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Skewers were delicious. We ordered both skewers set A and B and some other ones on top. All turned out good. Service was decent. We had a party of 5 and only the bar seats were available when we arrived. They offered to switch us to a bigger table once it became available."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual. I gave this place only 3 stars because of the noise. The izakayas in Japan are definitely NOT this noisy and for those who know how things are in Japan, you can tell they just overdo it here for the hype. 

Great place for a big group but be prepared to yell at each other as the music is way too loud. 

I'd come back but only as a small group and even then, I'd probably go to Imanishi instead!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent jap place to go to in the village :) near to my place and has became my new go-to place for a meal to treat myself. The only shortcoming is that the foods are quite expensive for this price, and I'm a girl with normal size stomach, it costs me like $35 or more to get full..."}
{"text":"The food was oishi desu! Has a variety of native japanese food.Friendly waitress,who took time to make sure food was great and satisfactory.Try any torched sushi"}
{"text":"I had an excellent dining experience at Kintaro. Friendly, fast service, and delicious food- the winning combo. I was with a group that tried a vast variety of items on the menu and I ended up having more new foods in this meal than I've had in the last year!

I had monkfish liver for the first time which was interesting; it reminded me of a more mild tasting foie gras.  I also tried mochi, skewered chicken gizzards, mushrooms wrapped in bacon and a host of other new dishes. I loved it all and is recommend being adventurous when you come. 

Seared tuna and steak is a must! Well seasoned and completely delicious. 

Long story short I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Kintaro is not a regular izakaya, but more like a yakatori-izakaya place. So if you like meat on a stick this is the place to be. My hubs and I didn't really know what yakatoris to try and were super hungry so we got set A and B which gives you a variety of yatoris, we also got the eel don, since my hubs loves eel. On another visit we got the eel don and the kintaro ramen.

Set A and B -  gives a nice variety of yakatoris, so if you want to try a bunch of different ones to share with friends, I recommend going this route. In set A we got 1 skewer of each - dark meat chicken, chicken wing, enoki wrapped bacon, and tomato wrapped bacon. In set B we got 1 skewer of each - chicken with green onion, pork loin, asparagus wrapped bacon, scallop, and beef ribs.

Overall, the yakatoris were great, nice smokey flavor from grilling over charcoal and the meat was generally not overcooked. The stand outs were surprisingly the dark meat chicken and chicken with onion, it was nice and moist and flavorful. The pork yakatoris were a little dry, and we kind of got tired of all the bacon types after a while. Both the scallops and beef ribs were nice.

Eel Don -  had a side of \"asian\" cesear salad and had 3 generous skewers of eel over rice. The eel was not the best we have ever had, but the best that we have had in Toronto so far. The eel was not dry and had a nice rich and smokey flavor. We found the glaze a bit too sweet and overpowering though. Great value though!

 
Kintaro Ramen - does not come with a lot of noodles, so I got noodles on the side for $2, the broth is excellent though, nice and rich but not too fatty, as in there is no lumps of oil floating on top (I am looking at you Raijin!). I actually drank all the broth which is something I rarely do. The meat is ok, it comes with 3 thin slices of pork shoulder and the egg is good. The noodles are a bit harder than I would like but pretty good. So overall, great broth and ok every other component.

Overall, this place is pretty affordable and good quality. You can get full from getting two dons and it will probably run you about $15ish per person tax and tip included. If you want to get yakatoris and drinks it might run you about $30ish per person. We have been back and the staff was pretty nice both times. I like that they automatically give you a dispenser jug of water as soon as you are seat. The decor is pretty cool and does remind me of izakayas in Japan, but with more space (which I like). This place is not as cramped or as loud as Guu so that is a plus in my books."}
{"text":"This Japanese style restaurant offers a menu with a variety of dishes beyond Sushi. We came here for dinner on a Saturday and it was packed with a line at the door. The atmosphere is intimate, the declre is nice.  

We ordered the spicy mayo shrimp, tako yaki, skewer set A, and grilled squid. 

The talk yaki was pretty good but very hot so let it sit a minute. The tempura shrimp with spicy Mayo is exactly what it sounds like. The skewers were the best part in my opinion but a little pricy.

I feel it's probably better to come here as a group of 4 so you can try a wider variety of dishes"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant opened in September and it is known for it's yakitori - grilled meats on skewers. We made reservations for 7:30pm and was seated at a table close to the door. So when ever someone is coming in, we can feel the cold chills. There was lots of different options on the menu, from yakitori to seafood to iron plates to sashimi and ramen. We finally decided what we wanted to eat about 7:45pm and it was the longest wait before we got our first dish. I'm still thinking that because we didn't order any alcohol at our table, our order is put to the bottom. Because the tables around us kept getting plates and we waited 1/2 hour before we got our first dish - chicken skin yakitori. I can't believe that took 1/2 hour to make, it took us less than a minute to eat. There was 2 skewers on each plate, 4 of us so we each had 2 bites.

Then we continue to wait and watch other tables get their food. Another 20 minutes later, we got our fried shrimp with mayo and the pork neck yakitori. There wasn't anything special about the fried shrimp, very typical. The pork neck, the meat was bigger piece than what I thought it would be. I only eaten other pork neck meat from Chinese dishes which are in thin slices. The meat was nicely grilled with rice cake in between.

After another 10 minutes, we got our 3rd yakitori - chicken with onion. This was the best yakitori of the night. Very juicy with great flavours. Once we were done, the next dish came - fried chicken wings. This dish was disappointing after an hour wait, it was hot off the fryer but there wasn't much flavour on.

We took our time finishing off the shrimp and wings trying to stall the time for our final dish to come. We asked them when if they forgot the order but they said the chef is making it. After 50 minutes of waiting at 9:36pm, we finally got our takoyaki. The onion flakes on top were not moving at all, a sign that this dish is not hot at all. And when I bite into it, I was right, the octopus ball was cold. It wasn't even close to lukewarm so never mind being hot and steaming. WTF, waited almost an hour for this and what we got was cold??? That is ridiculous. The table next to us got it too and they nearly just sat down 30 mins ago while we waited 2 hours. The other table send it back and want them to reheat but we just got so frustrated and didn't want to wait another hour to get this re-heated. The takoyaki was not impressive, one piece of octopus meat and the rest was dough.

Very very disappointing meal, 2 hours for 6 small dishes to come. We didn't even get anything big, 3 skewers, wings, shrimp and takoyaki. I'm not going to come back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered set B with a side of salmon sashimi. Sashimi is very fresh and delicious. The skewers are just mind blown. All of the skewers are cooked to perfection. Definitely order them when you come visit."}
{"text":"Best yakitori I've had outside of Japan, great sake selection and fun décor to boot. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was the best food I've had while visiting Toronto. The Chashu don was amazing! I wish I would've gotten a picture. The bowl it was served in was sizzling so the rice at the bottom was crispy and delicious. The place itself was also really cool. Felt like I was in an urban bar in Japan. Domo Arigato!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite izakaya place, even more so than Kinka (aka Guu). Everything I had there was consistently good and presentation wise it looks amazing. Came here on a Friday at 7:30pm without a reservation and only waited 10 minutes for a table. What drew me to this place was their polar beer with it's cute little frozen froth which is super picturesque. I was honestly impressed by their consistency, everything I had was good that night. 

We got the pork belly which was super tender and and flavourful. The fat was melt in your mouth good.

Most of the food I got were skewers since that seems like what they are known for since it is an izakaya. The grilled skewers had nice grill marks and had a nice smokey taste to them. I got the skewer platter (mochi with cheese, oyster mushrooms, beef, pork belly, scallops)- my favourite had to be the scallops which tasted really fresh. They kept the flavour pretty simple but it allowed the ingredients to really shine through. I tried to be adventurous and got the chicken gizzard, it was a lot less scary than what I had thought since they cut them into little bites. These were seasoned well and were flavourful- I would actually order it again! We also got the mochi with chicken which had a really nice smokey flavour, the texture of the mochi was also great. The okonomiyaki was surprisingly really good and it's one of the better ones that I have had around the city. I also got corn which I am pretty bias about- but it was very sweet and tasted buttery."}
{"text":"My friend and I really wanted to try out an izakaya while in Toronto. For those who are wondering what the heck an izakaya is, it's basically a Japanese version of a pub that serves a bunch of different drinks and small plates. We decided to try out Kintaro since the wait was pretty long at Guu. It was a quick walk from our hotel and its location in the middle of the bars on Church St was perfect! 

The atmosphere here is awesome. It's dimly lit with a modern Japanese vibe going on (if that makes sense haha). The sake list is huge and they also offer tons of other drinks (beer towers!). My friend ordered the polar beer ($8.50), which seemed to be a very popular drink on Yelp. You need to get this! It was basically a glass of beer with an icy top (see pic). I ordered the Hi-Ball ($6.50) which was their twist on a whiskey ginger. Let's just say I had a couple of these...

I love the concept of Japanese tapas. They have 4 menus here full of different small plate options. We shared the momo negi ($5.50) - chicken thigh with green onion, edamameyaki ($6) - baked soy beans, and the Kintaro ramen ($10.95). The chicken thigh was juicy and the green onion gave it some great added flavor. The edamameyaki was delicious. It was my first time trying soybeans baked instead of boiled and it was so much better. As for the ramen, the broth was spot on, but the noodles were a little weak. 

I'm happy we stumbled upon this place. We left satisfied and were literally steps away from the bars we planned on going to. It was a great first time experience at an izakaya and now I'm always searching for one in every city I visit!"}
{"text":"Wow we had such a great time here. Isaac and Will took amazing care of us even though it was super busy on probably the busiest weekend ever in the village. I've brought all sorts of friends and clients here from Japan and we always have a great time. The atmosphere really reminds me of a izakaya in Tokyo.  The wood benches, the yakitori counter, food is great, and they are lucky to have Will as the manager. I was introducing my friend from Japan to Toronto culture and this place was perfect,  especially because of our friendly waiter Isaac. I love this city and that we can have places like this. Will be back soon. Glad I got to meet some of the staff personally this time. It really makes a difference these days."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend of mine so I thought i'd check it out and I am so glad I did. By far, my favourite izakaya. The ambience and design of the place was so warming and had beautiful authentic pieces that I loved. 
The menu was gigantic with many items you can choose from. My friends and I couldn't decide what we wanted so our server recommended most of our dishes which were all very tasty. The gyoza stuffed chicken wings and wagyu yuke were especially delicious, a must try. The food took a bit longer than expected but we didn't mind the wait as we drank and chatted away. 
Another thing you need to try on your visit here is their special Asahi Polar Beer which contains of frozen foam that keeps your beer fresh and cold for over 20minutes! It was so cool and looked like icecream! They offer a combo with 2 polar beers and your choice of a karaage dish. we ordered the tori kawa karaage with the 2 frozen beers and they were both spectacular! Im not much of a beer drinker but i really enjoyed this beer and even ordered more! 
Our server was very friendly, attentive, and not to mention, handsome. He chatted with us and even surprised us with some service on the house! I give service a 5/5!
My friends and I loved this place and will definitely be visiting again soon to try their 3L beer tower, I've never seen anything like it before and it looks gigantic. I cant wait until my next Kintaro experience!"}
{"text":"This is sensational Japanese. Fresh and incredibly cooked. I can't rate it high enough - and great smart service. A definite must."}
{"text":"Toronto is home to many, many Japanese izakayas, and a lot of them have the loud and lively atmosphere in common - afterall, izakaya is a drinking establishment in Japan.  I do enjoy that atmosphere when going out with friends or having a girls night, but sometimes I prefer a more intimate and cozy environment that allows for conversation over food.  Toronto's Kintaro Izakaya on Church St. that opened in late summer of 2013 was perfect for that.

When we walked in, we were seated without waiting and noticed many posters & signs that made the place feel like a restaurant in Japan!  Loved all the details.

Not only does Kintaro differentiate itself by specializing in yakitori, the skewered & grilled chicken parts, it also boasts a big dining space with many booths for privacy of their diners.

 Char Su (barbecued, marinated pork) - $11.95 - I wish we got the dish that comes with rice. It was too salty to eat by itself.

Chicken Karage (Japanese style fried chicken) - $12.00 - The fried chicken was tender with a crispy outer layer - perfect!  The accompanying salad on the side was delicious as well, especially the crispy taro chips.

Unagi (eel) - $11.50 - Pretty good - but not work $11.50.

Beef Karubi (short ribs) - $6.40 each
Riceball Bacon (bacon wrapped ricecake) - $5.50 each
Ebimaki Bacon (bacon wrapped shrimp) - $6.90 each
We loved all of these, especially the bacon wrapped rice cake for its chewy texture.  The short ribs were enjoyable as well, you get a lot for the price.

Enoki Bacon (bacon wrapped enoki mushroom) - $7.50
 One of my favourite kushi's of the night.  You can't go wrong with bacon-wrapped-anything, really!

Tonkotsu Miso (pork-bone soup noodle) - $10.95
The ramen was mediocre. It was a good change from the skewered meats we were having, but I probably wouldn't order this again.

I really enjoyed the quiet & intimate atmosphere here - definitely a good post for date nights!  The service was fast and friendly as well.  I found that overall, the food was good, especially the kushis, but compared to other izakaya & kushi restaurants, non-kushi entrees are slightly higher priced."}

I almost don't want to write a review for Kintaro because I want to keep this place for myself. It's been my go-to spot for last month or so and I love it so much that I don't want people knowing about it. Oh the irony of being a food blogger, I guess I will share one of my favorite restaurants at the moment with you guys since I am in a good mood today.

I randomly found this place on yelp, cause you know, thats what I do on spare time- look for newly opened restaurants and bookmark the heck out so that my 'to-try' restaurant list never ends.

First thing about Kintaro that triggered my interest in the first place was that they serve polar beer. Polar beer is known for the long-lasting freshness with its lightly frozen foam at -5 celcius and it acts as a layer on top, preventing the beer from losing the coldness and taste of your draft beer for over 20 minute. How cool is that? a frozen foam on top of beer and nobody likes luke warm beer right? plus it looks so adorable!

Ordered: 2 Polar Beer + Karaage Set for $24.95, you can choose from deep fried chicken wings, cartilage, skin or karaage. This is a good was to start your meal and it is an awesome deal. We chose chicken cartilage and it was super crispy and perfect with beer.

Ordered: Assorted skewer set B includes Chicken with onion, Pork loin, Asparagus wrapped with bacon, scallop and beef rib skewers for $19.95. This set has little bit of everything and it's a great option if you feel overwhelmed by so many choices of yakitori they offer. I especially love the scallops and the bacon wrapped asparagus.

Ordered: Wakatake Onikoroshi (Junmai Sake), 720mL for $68- this was a nice, light sake to accompany our meal

Ordered: Tori Minchi (Chicken meat ball stuffed Pimento) for $4.50. Chicken meatball was seasoned just right and it paired well with the sweet pimento.

Ordered: Butarosu (Pork loin) for $5.50. This was something we ordered again on the side just because we enjoyed it very much

Ordered: Yaki Mentaiko (Baked fish egg) for $3.50. For what the price is, the portion is really tiny but it's so good!

Ordered: Yaki Mochi for $3.50. This was topped with honey and some purikake, it was recommended we eat it while it's hot cause it gets really hard once it cools down.

Ordered: Yuke (Raw beef with vegetales and sauce) for $15.90. I really liked how this was served with some seaweed, salad and avocado on the side. We mixed up the egg yolk with raw beef and wrapped it up in the seaweed and it was delicious!

Ordered: Ebi Karaage (Deep fried shrimp) for $12. These are tiny shrimps and they deep fry the entire thing for you so that you can eat the head as well. This is always so perfect paired with beer.

Ordered: Ika Teriyaki (Squid with teriyaki sauce) served with mayo for $9.00. We wanted one last dish to finish off our meal and this caught our eye. It was cooked perfectly, tender and seasoned just right. Can't go with grilled squid!

Summary: I've been to Kintaro around 3 times now and I always have a good time there. One thing I love about Kintaro is that the restaurant is spacious and it's not crazy loud in there. I can actually think, hold proper conversations and don't have to walk out with a major headache. Plus I love the laid back atmosphere and the staff are always super friendly. Do keep in mind that when you order skewers here, it will add up on your bill so this is def not a place to stuff your face. Or if you are really hungry, it might be a good idea to order one of the rice dishes or noodles to fill you up. Ok, now the secret (not really) is out- go check out Kintaro and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"The food was alright, I wasn't blown away by any of the dishes that we had ordered."}
{"text":"I heard of this izakaya through a friend; definitely a cozy place that has a great environment that makes you want to catch up with a few friends. I've been here a few times, to both drink and eat. 
I'm not a huge fan of drinking, so one thing that caught my eye was a cocktail they had on the menu, the Nama Grapefuit. As the name suggests, you would think it would have a bitter grapefruit taste to it, but surprisingly it doesn't at all. It's a mildly sweet, tangy cocktail with a very mild alcohol taste, very enjoyable for someone who cant stand the taste of alcohol. 
I've also had their spicy sashimi dish, with a variety of sashimi coated in their spicy sauce. Their fish was pleasingly fresh, with a little kick from their sauce, cut with the creaminess of the ripe avocado.  Super satisfying!
Their skewers also seem to be a very big hit as well! I

Overall, the menu is well put together and very well priced. The atmosphere is very inviting with the dimmed lighting and their not-too-loud music. All the staff seem to be very kind and knowledgeable on the menu.
I would definitely come back here!

{"text":"Great food, decent service and well priced. A little slow tonight but the server explained that they were understaffed. Definitely the best Japanese restaurant in the area. Will be back for sure!

Only missing one star because of the slow service, but I am confident it was a once off."}
{"text":"Excellent salmon avocado sushi, loved the avo/tuna tartare and the hamachi sashimi was pretty good too. Will order hot food next time as couldn't get past all that yummy raw fish. Excellent service to boot."}
{"text":"Now under new management this place is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Fast service, good food, friendly servers. A++ in my books. It has a laid back atmosphere that I prefer over Guu (which I find too noisy for my liking). 

The polar beers are a must - such a great photo to take.

Compared to other izakaya restaurants, I find the portion size here to be larger. Perfect to share with 2 other friends. It has good variety of food. Everything from delicious meat skewers, fresh sushi, filling rice bowls and noodles. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good to share a bunch of small plates with the table. I've tried the tuna tataki, karaage, soft shell crab, ebi mayo, premium sashimi set, japango roll, and some of their skewers.
The tuna tataki is perfectly seared. The karaage is a large portion so it's good for a large group. 
Usually I don't like soft shell crab that much but I actually enjoyed it here and would order it again. It was a little on the salty side though.
The ebi mayo was pretty average and so was the sashimi set.
What really stood out to me was the japango roll. It was really tasty and full of flavour. I didn't expect the sushi roll to stand out here as they are more specialized in their grilled food, but I'm really glad I tried it."}
{"text":"First of all, the wall decoration made me feel I was in izakaya in Tokyo. 

For appetizer, we had deep fried oyster, agedashi tofu and buta kakuni. Everything were so good. Buta Kakuni would be highly recommended! 

I had Nagasaki chanpon too. Soup was ok but they put way too much chili. I needed to put away from soup first. And noodle should be thick egg noodle but it was thinner ramen noodle. A little disappointment. 

Our server was super friendly and best!"}
{"text":"Great experience and food! 

First off, the entrance is cute with the wooden looking exterior. The interior is very nice with pillows on the seats and the izakaya is dimly lit. Around 6 PM they dim it down even more. The staff are all very friendly. They greet you in Japanese once you enter, and are very attentive and quick. 

The special thing about this izakaya is that they give you a pumping water jug that you have to pump out your water. It made the child inside of me come out! I It was so cool and made the water taste so much better!

The food was really good. Must tries are the polar beer and the tori (chicken) karaage! SO BOMB! When we ordered the polar beers, they had just turned the machine on so we had to wait around 15 minutes for it. While waiting, the server brought us each a pint of Sapporo beer and said that they give these to customers who have to wait. AMAZING! The polar beers are adorable with the cold slush on the top. It stays cold for about 20 minutes so it's perfect for a hot day. The server saw us struggling to drink it and offered us straws. He said that many customers use the straws to drink it. I have to say, it tasted so much better with the straw! It is Sapporo beer so I enjoyed it even more! The cups also have a Kintaro polar beer picture on it, along with the Kintaro on it. 

The chicken karaage ($12) is well seasoned and very tender. It is like an explosion of flavour in your mouth. I tasted some nori as well as a coated with a crispy and floury coating. There is a side of 3 pickled radish cubes that were sweet, and some cabbage salad with some dressing. 

Next, the Spicy Sashimi salad ($6) was delicious! There were chunks of tuna and slices of salmon coated in hot pepper dressing. I thought it tasted very similar to the Korean hot chili paste. Mixed in with the sashimi are some cucumber cubes. On the side, are some ginger, wasabi, and garnished with white radish noodles. 

The Eringi (king mushroom) yakitori ($5.50) was grilled very well. The mushroom wasn't over or under cooked, but just right. The slices were a good thickness and were seasoned with some sweet sauce and salt. 

The takoyaki came in 8 octopus balls ($10). They weren't fully ball-shaped, but the were semi circle-shaped. They were also very good. The octopus pieces were really big and the takoyaki were crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. 

To finish off our meal, we had the assorted mochi ice cream. It came in four halves of mango, vanilla, strawberry, and matcha. It was also plated with a rice cracker. The mochi were ice cold but sooo yummy! My favourites were the matcha and strawberry although I also really enjoyed the mango and vanilla. The mochi was chewy and the icecream was smooth and creamy. 

I had an amazing experience here, everything was great, the staff and service was awesome! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Loved my experience at Kintaro! Got the polar beer combo, and it is fantastic for a slow drinker like me since it is true to its claims that your beer will be ice cold for 20 min. My bf wasn't that fond of it though, since he drinks fast and the frozen foam kind of hinders his speed. So, order according to your drinking pace!! The combo also came with your choice of karagge, we chose chicken skin which was great (I mean, you can't really mess up fried fat) and was a much bigger portion than I imagined!

We also ordered the yakitori set A, which had bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes, chicken and leek, chicken and rice cake, bacon and enoki mushrooms, and chicken wings. Food was delicious, they were also true to their word when they said that you will taste a distinct charcoal flavour, which I love. I also ordered baked rice cake thinking it would be mochi (like the picture) but it turned out to be dduk (korean rice cake) which makes sense since I noticed the owner was Korean (a few of the staff are Japanese though). That one was alright, I think use of mochi would have tasted better. 

A bonus for Kintaro in comparison to many other izakayas is that they have a don/ramen section to their menu, which means that if you intend on having a full meal as opposed to small snack plates you can!!

Overall, awesome experience, will return when convenient!"}
{"text":"Beer & Meat on a stick - How the hell can this combo ever go wrong? Easy 4 stars.

Service was quick and efficient. Our server made recommendations when we asked for his help. Nice layout & atmosphere - good for conversations with friends and not overly loud.

Beer options included Asahi & Asahi Black, Sapporo and Kirin. Lot's of Sake choices as well.

I ordered the Polar Bear beer - Beer with some kind of frozen beer flavoured foam on top (keeps your beer cold). PROBLEM - you just get baby sips since the damn foam gets in the way. I should have known better when all the ladies were drinking it - meant to be cute, not functional!  
  
Since this was a pre-dinner snack, we just shared a few items...

- Beef Tenderloin: Very tender with a nice charcoal flavour. Included rice cakes on the skewer. Excellent choice for a meat lover.

- Bacon covered mushrooms: How could this dish ever go wrong?

- Chicken: Also very tender, good quality breast meat. The skewer includes delicious rice cakes, so good.

- Chicken Meatballs: Also very good, I would love these in a sandwich. Maybe I will bring my own crusty bread next time.

You can also get preset skewer sets (two options) and various Ramen choices.

Going to try the Bacon wrapped pineapple next time. Whole roasted corn cobs also looked good. 

Just come with lots of friends and order away. Prices average in the $5 - $8 range for two or three skewers. 

I will be back for sure...very soon.

But the katsu was very cheap and service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I really like Kintaro. Everytime I go I try something new off the menu and it is never a disappointment. I especially love the tako yaki. Service is friendly and on point the entire evening we were there. They have good food and drinks specials throughout week to eye out for"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to try eating at more places along Church, since we live near there but never eat there. This was on my list of places to try.

Service was friendly and good. I really liked the polar beer! Definitely a must try. I also had apple cinnamon shochu, which I enjoyed but my fiancé felt like it tasted like \"winter\" (i guess Christmasy flavours?). 

Fried chicken was great! Everything was good but I ordered too much meat. Bathrooms were super clean. I would go back, but it wasn't an overwhelming \"must go back right now\", just a nice option in the 'hood. 4 dishes, 2 drinks ran $70"}
{"text":"ive stars for food and service. 
second time here. I came with my friends in the evening, its not too noisy compare to other izakaya. we could actually talk and stay here for long. love the atmosphere here!!
 
the food was super great tasty. sushi and sashimi was fresh and great quality fish. the meatball was also amazing. 
absolutely love the unique beer tower ( 3000ml )here.
ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"Another \"just for an experience\" restaurant. One good thing about them is they open till 1am which is perfect for someone (like me) who gets craving at the midnight. I ordered the bunches of skewers, and the things is they aren't seasoning well. All you can tell is they are meat and nothing above that. Get impressed by the polar beer, it's kind of cool (literally) to froze the beer this way. I like it, but my boyfriend thinks the foam was way too strong."}
{"text":"The Japango roll was very good. Beef was thin sliced and tender, I thought it was frozen raw beef but this cooked type tasted good too.

Can't say anything about the grills, they all have gotten cold when we started eating - we were taking too much :P 

I like their layout and decor, not very big but has enough space and seats. I was surprised that the waiters were still nice to us after we spent 2 hours chatting there.

I'd love to re-visit next time when we need a izakaya."}
{"text":"Amazing! Came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night - highly recommend the skewers, and ebi mayo!"}
{"text":"My visit to Kintaro is probably one of the worse experience, not just so-so but horrible. 

My coworkers and I went there on a weekday night around 6:30pm, there was no other table beside us and we thought it was just because we were early that day. Everything was fine (by fine, I meant food weren't memorable but it was not bad for the price) until we receive the stuffed chicken wings. 

My coworker first took a bite and I saw a pink-ish color inside so I stop her from eating it further and ask for the server immediately. When the server came by I asked nicely why is the meat inside the chicken in pink-color, is it not fully cooked yet? He respond by 'I will go to the kitchen and ask' coming back with an answer 'The chef said it's mixed with pork so that's why there is a pink-ish color'. That made me more suspicious, first of all, the chef did not take a look at it, second if there's pork shouldn't it be FULLY cooked (aka not pink). Anyway I didn't think the answer was legitimate and asked the server to bring it in to the chef to take a look. He came back after, without the dish saying 'SORRY, IT'S NOT COOKED, WE WILL REMAKE IT'...Sorry yelper, I did not have the picture to justify this but I do not make random accusation for no reason.

Well, they did TRY to make it up to us, by offering us icecream or a sip of sake each on the house. I did not find this to be reasonable at all...We would've gotten really sick from eating raw pork yet this is how they try to make it up. I will not return for raw pork and poor service/management. And for all those that still want to try this place, please make sure meat are fully cooked (aka. pork) so you won't be visiting the hospital or washroom afterward."}
{"text":"Both me and my bf loves Japanese food. We went this place on New Year Eve with high expectation. However, it was really disappointed.

Service:
We were there around 7:30pm and the restaurant was full. The service was extremely slow.  There was only ONE waiter on new year eve who served the entire restaurant. So we ended up waiting for 20mins to get our first dish. 

Food:
The choice of the food was limited and we were told that all the hot dishes(including ramen) were run out for the day. How could you run out of food on a new year eve after 1.5 hours of the service!!  The quality food was not impressed either. Some of the dishes were already cold when we got it. 

Price:
Compared to other Izakaya  such as Guu and Zakkushi, their food was actually much more expensive. 
I recommend you go to go Zakkushi if you love Japanese grill. 

Overall, it was a really new year eve experience. 
I don't think i would ever go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Chose this as my birthday destination for a small party of 5. I was able to book reservations for a Saturday night, thank goodness because this place was jam packed. Service was pretty good for being so busy and it didn't take too long for the food to come. What I appreciated was the fact they told us when something was going to take longer than usual prior to ordering! We tried a variety of different tapas, they were all flavourful, decently priced and portioned. There are many options for chicken, beef, pork and bacon.. all marinated and flavourful unlike some places where the meat is bland. I like my \"first kiss drink\" I didnt taste the alcohol at all lol which can be looked at as a good or bad thing. I tried the Polar beer as well, all for my instastories... it was basic besides the frozen foam which I found awkward to drink. I was so close to asking for a straw lol. The washroom staircase was rather narrow and I found it akward that the ladies bathroom door was left wide open as the stalls had gaps between them. I swear you can see people in the stall as well as your neighbour lol..."}
{"text":"Under the impression that this place had relatively good ramen, I dragged my boyfriend here because he wanted ramen and I wanted other menu options. We ended up ordering quiet a few number of dishes and they all averaged out at around \"mediocre\". 

1) Koroke (potato croquettes) = we expected this to be like tater tots, but they were much larger, like hash browns, and the filling was more like mashed potatoes and not chunky potatoes. The batter was nicely deep fried though, very light and crispy. 
2) Takoyaki = ehhh.. the filling was too mushy and lacked texture but the octopus pieces were alright
3) Kintaro ramen = nooooooooooope. Fellow Yelpers, you have led me astray. This was not good ramen at all, the noodles resembled cup noodles too much and overall, the broth was lacking in flavour. The presentation was also lackluster. 
4) Chef choice 6pc sushi = yea, not the best I've had. Nothing tasted that fresh and some pieces that were supposed to be \"torched\" were just.. overcooked. It changed the palatability of the fish making it tough and just weird.
5) Japango roll = Yet again, just average. Not the best I've had, but not bad. I usually love torched sashimi but I'm not a big fan of the way this restaurant does it, they seem to overdo it and it just takes away from the whole \"sashimi\" aspect.

There was nothing special about this place that would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Yakitori, and my favorite restaurant is Zakkushi on Carlton. I was told that this place has Yakitori too, and so I stopped by to try this place. 

Overall, this place is a small restaurant that had a welcoming atmosphere. It was a little bit loud because there was a group by the window that was having a great time, but that was to be expected. 

In terms of the food, there really wasn't anything great to write home about. The Chicken skin skewers were great, but the others weren't that memorable."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places downtown! The food is on-point (especially the skewers), and it's not DEAFENING like most izakayas are. They have some neat features as well, like the polar beer and the beer tower (which is a sight to behold). Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Would definitely recommend for some chill time with friends"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing handmade dumplings!  One of the city's best izakaya places.  Gyoza was better the Mother dumplings.  One of the best restaurants in the village."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 5 years and can honestly say the food offered here is as authentic as it gets in Toronto.  Others who say this matches other izakaya's in the city are flat out wrong in my humble opinion.  (although I have not yet been to Guu up the street).  

The food here is unique, and DELICIOUS!  It is one place in the city I am eager to 'try new dishes' and my friends always ask to go here when they come downtown to my place, from out in the 'burbs.

Love the ice swirl on top of my beer.  Cute.  Very Japanese-y. :)"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, and always enjoy our time here. We have had the Kintaro Tonkotsu Ramen, the gyoza, and the chicken karaage. All of them were delicious. 

The ambience is great, and perfect for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Although it was a busy day, touched by the waiters/waitresses trying there best for the services. Appetizer and sushis came out early that we could hold on to the delays for the skewers. I should visit there on the weekdays to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend and was really impressed by the quality of the dishes they served in addition to the ambiance that they had set up.  While it was a bit slow, I wasn't complaining as we were seated immediately.  It was a nice touch that they had some catchy R&B, Old school rap that made their place feel fun to be in.

The first dish I had was their Kintaro (Tonkotsu) ramen.  It was rich, creamy and hit the spot as it was a bone chilling evening that night.  The noodles had that perfect bounce - all in all the bowl of ramen was slurped down in its entirety, lip smacking and all.

The second dish I had was their Yakitori stick set B.  Their skewers were fired up over their traditional charcoal grill.  The end result was succulent skewers, bursting with flavours and the charcoaly after-taste that you would expect.

Lastly, I had their Kimchi udon dish.  While a bit different from what you would get from any of the Guu restaurants, they had a different spin on theirs.  It was different in that they had a lot more udon noodles, but less kimchi than you would expect from a Guu style Kimchi udon dish.

While I had an enjoyable time there, I was surprised that there weren't more people packed into this place.  I'd go so far as they would go toe to toe against, Guu, Zakkushi or any of the other established Izakayas.

If you're ever in the Village and want an authentic yakitori/izakaya experience - Kintaro (not to be confused with Mortal Kombat's Kintaro... ) is the place to be!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, staff are friendly. Service were fast.  Unfortunately, we saw dust ball on the overhead lights at our table, and the tables next to us. My friend only told me after we finished eating so that it won't ruin my meal.... They did to do better job at cleaning their fixtures."}
{"text":"So good for just a few skewers of yummy meat on the way to more food. Slow service."}
{"text":"I really, really, really, really like Kintaro on Church St!! My girlfriends and I came here at 5PM for dinner without reservation and the place was relatively empty (later filled up to ~30%) and we were all absolutely blown away by the food!!! Omg the FLAVORS and textures here are creative, detail-oriented, and overall phenomenal... Truly a gastropub. I would highly recommend all of their seafood dishes (perfect blend of umami and sometimes other surprising flavors subtle upon first bite). 

Beautiful traditional japanese interior and seating. This izakaya is also much QUIETER than other izakayas, which tend to be loud and kind of rowdy. The music here tonight was western and medium-low volume, the staff didn't often shout greetings, and the other customers spoke at normal volumes. I could hear my friend, who spoke softly at times, perfectly from across the table.

Food portions here are on the smaller end since Kintaro is tapas style, I would recommend coming here with a group of people and ordering many dishes to share. Pescatarians and vegetarians have no fear... They have a lot of seafood or veggie only options that are just as delicious or even more so than the beef and pork selections :) The server recommended many dishes and we ordered them all lol:

Apps:
Salmon and avocado salad 3.5/5 - Super fresh salmon sashimi A+. Avocado, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes were so refreshing given how protein heavy the rest of the meal was. But as we got the other dishes, this one became less impressive and unique by comparison.
Ebi Mayo 6/5 - One of our favorite dishes tonight! The shrimp were jumbo and coated with tempura (deep-fried), but it was the mayo sauce that tasted so perfect. First bite in, all 3 of us were melting :P
Okonomiyaki 4/5 - We ordered a seafood one. It was smaller than other ones I've ordered elsewhere in the past, but was thick, heavy, and had wonderful tasting toppings and sauce. the dough part was a bit slimy, which I wasn't a fan of, but great flavor.

Skewers: We decided not to order the sets since 2 of us doesn't eat red meat and you can't customize your own sets

Scallop 3/5 - Scallops were too small
Ebi 1/5 - Only giving it a 1 since my standards for this place has gotten so high XD The shrimp were tiny and flavors nonexistent. Nothing special, you can replicate this at home.
Ika teriyaki 5/5 - My personal favorite skewer since I love squid. It wasn't on a stick like the other skewers, but was grilled, which gave the squid excellent texture and flavor. The teriyaki sauce on top was sweet, enhanced the squid's nature flavor, and not overbearing. 
Eringi 3/5 - I like king mushrooms, but that was really all that it tasted like. Didn't have any sauce to enhance the flavor, but was cooked with butter (mandatory to not burn on the grill). Dunno what I was expecting.
Yaki mochi 6/5 - Really liked this one! Big mochi balls, also not on a stick. Subtle honey sweetness on the outside, crispy outer covering, chewy umami center (mochi). Sweet + umami = killer combo

Paid ~$30 per person not including tip. Wonderful experience here tonight and will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Great atmosphere and decoration. Has stylish open wooden booths. I've ordered nearly all of the skewers and they're all great. Serves some hard to find japanese dishes as well...but not quite a big fan of the polar beer. Overall a great place and my go to restaurant for groups."}
{"text":"My friend and I always come here on Sundays and Mondays for their $14 pitchers! Their yakitori (skewers) are a bit pricy but the ingredients are definitely worth the price. I had the karaage, which is a bigger portion here than other izakayas but the nuggets are much smaller (like popcorn chicken)--no complaints though, they're still great. 

There's a special here every night except for Friday and Saturday: 
Sunday Monday $14 Sapporo pitchers 
Tues-Thurs $14 sake 

We'll keep coming here!"}
{"text":"This was a spontaneous drop by as my date and I were looking for a random izakaya. The atmosphere and decor was really nice. (Minus for one obnoxious loud table, which the waitress kindly moved us upon request) It was a nice, chill, and quiet place to hang out but still have fun. I loved the water pumping device haha

Food wise I didn't know what to expect but we were really happy with the choices.

Tuna Goma Ae 4/5
Really good! The dressing with the spinach and bonito worked soo well. The texture of the tuna was not as firm as I would have liked so, I would go for the straight spinach next time.  For the spinach alone,it would be 5/5.

Sashimi 10 piece 4/5
Quite fresh! The salmon and mackerel were our favourites.

Sushi combo 3/5
Pretty good too. But tbh I wouldn't just come here just for the sushi, I would put the money towards other dishes.

Yaki tori set A 4.5/5
This came with pork belly, king mushroom, strip loin,  scallop, and mune cheese. We loved the pork belly and strip loin a lot. Pork belly has a great crunch on the skin,  not too fatty, and nice salty taste. Strip loin was very tender! The mushrooms and scallop was both sweet and juicy. My date was meh about the chicken but it really grew on me. The flavours of the cheese and chicken work nicely and it was really tender. I suggest eating from lightest in taste to strongest to get the best flavour out of it. 
Scallop, mushroom, strip loin, mune cheese, then pork belly.

Mentaiko 5/5
This had such a great grill flavour that worked soo well with the spicy and salty fish eggs. I loved this a lot even though it was quite salty. Just eat it with something or a drink.

Aburi shima saba 4.5/5
I really liked this but my date LOVED this. The seared outside brought out a subtle buttery flavour that worked well with the cured fish. Rather small portion for the price but we enjoyed it.

Edamame 5/5
You can't go wrong with $1 Edamame!  It was nice, unlike some places where it's been cooked to death, this was very plump , flavourful , and great starter.

We took advantage of the 15% off sake and got Tamano Hikari. Nice sooth sake that got more aromatic ans flavourful as you drank it. Overall, the service, ambience, and food was very good. Prices are a little much for the portions but still very good. Take advantage of the weekly specials discounts :)"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The food though...could've used a bit more work as I think it was a bit pricey for the quality. I haven't been to many places that specialize in skewers, but I have had better elsewhere. The Hario water pump was the highlight of my night. I don't know why, but I had too much fun pumping water. My table ordered the Set A and Set B skewers, Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, Chicken Karaage, Beef Tataki and yaki mochi. 

I liked Set A overall, but my partner liked set B more. The main reason why I liked Set A more was because of the scallops and the eringi. I wasn't too much of a fan of the mochi 
- The skewer sets were good and each had its own merits and demerits.
- I liked the beef tenderloin over the striploin. Sagari beats Karubi.
- The pork belly and neck were pretty close.
- The Momo Negi was much better than the Cheese Mune, but there was green onion (I dislike green onions).

The okonomiyaki and the takoyaki were good. I'd recommend them.
The chicken karaage pieces were smaller than the ones i've had at other tapa's and weren't as juicy than other tapa's in toronto.

I liked the beef tataki sauce and apparently the yaki mochi was very good as a dessert.

I would probably suggest that they have a 'choose any 4 skewers meal' because these skewers aren't actually that big. So, if you were to eat here, don't eat here as a meal replacement unless you really want to :3. Oh, if you order beer, you'll get this huge pipe filled with beer and you get to pump that too.  

Price: 3/5
Service: 5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Price Point: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place. I'd say the food is good, but I've definitely had better ones at some other izakaya places. 
The ambience is typical for an izakaya, but I was surprised to find that the waiter and chef are Koreans not Japanese. 

For the food:  on a scale of 5 
1.The grilled squid 5
The grilled squid is pretty good. It's juicy and tender yet have a slightly chewy feel, which is exactly what I expected for a squid dish! The mayonnaise on the side is very tasty and flavorful. 
Highly recommend! 
2. We got a skewers set B, 4
which includes some chicken skewers, beef skewer, and grilled tomatoes. I like the skewer with chicken thigh. It's very flavorful and tender. The chicken breast with rice cake one is a bit on the dry side. The beef skewers is kinda salty too my taste? and the salt is sprinkled unevenly on this skewer. The grilled tomatoes are nice.
3. Japango rolls 3.5
This is just average rolls you can get anywhere, not special. 
I know I shouldn't expect a izakaya place with super tasty rolls, so this is just Ok. 
4. Gyu don 3.5
If you are expecting some authentic Japanese gyu don and this will let you down... it comes in a hot stone bowl which you typically found in Korean restaurants and it tastes nothing like gyu don but beef bulggugi ! But the taste is fine. The portion is really small tho.

The service is good, they are really nice and polite.
Overall, I'd come back sometime after to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"A relatively new place and lived up to my standards. We went on a Saturday night and the place was not too busy since it opened about 2 month ago (?). The decor and atmosphere was clean and modern and the staff was very courteous. 

Must try the fried chicken skin and yakitori chicken skin. The pork was definitely not as good as the chicken. Tried set A, but would rather order directly from other things on the menu.  Price-wise, everything was reasonable. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice and it's amazing! Food is really good, staff is friendly and welcoming and the design itself is just cool - I always take a variety of skewers (make sure to try the bacon wrapped mochi!! The squid skewer is one of the best there too!) and I suggest the braised pork belly as an appetizer, along with the mackerel! I also tried some fried shrimps, as a courtesy from the chef, delicious!

Great experience, will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Happened to go to Kintaro for Friday night dinner.  We wanted tapas and drinks and this place happened to have great reviews! 

We walked in and were greeted very pleasantly and seated quickly! 

For drinks we got the Nama lime , Nama grapefruit and Fuji! Loved the concept of Nama found it very interactive! Drinks were great! 

We ordered the seven spice wings, fish and chips (loved the lotus root chips) - was kind of surprised we got a whole fish fried, as we expected a traditional filet! But it was amazing loved the sauce with it. The seven spice wings were by far my favourite dish! Amazing , they have an option of drumsticks as well, but the wings were really really tasty. We then ordered the beef tataki - the green onions with the beef was a great combination, the beef meatballs which melted in our mouth, the spicy salmon was good , but liked the other tapas a lot better.  Last round we ordered the ebi, the spice on the grilled shrimp took me back to fresh shrimp I've had in Bali. Was just mouth watering! And we had the torikawa which is chicken skin fried and seasoned, I didn't like it at all , but on our friends did! It's acquired taste I feel! 

Overall loved the place, it was cozy good service and amazing food! Would go back again soon!"}
{"text":"When we arrived in Toronto, it was kind of late and we were tired and hungry. Kintaro Japanese Restaurant is located in Gay Village in Toronto. It was packed and we waited a short while for a wooden booth with cushioned seats.

Since it was chilly night, we decided to warm up with cups of hot Japanese Green Tea.

We shared a few appetizers including Agedashi Tofu, Sashimi Sampler, and Yakitori as well as two Ramen. 

The Agedashi Tofu consisted of deep fried soft tofu served with radish and scallion in a dashi broth. 

The Sashimi Sampler consisted of three kinds of chef choice sashimi - seared butter fish, tuna, and salmon. The fish selection was fresh and rather unique. 

For grilled meats, there was a minimum of two orders so we ordered two Momo Negi and one Sagari. The Momo Negi consisted of grilled chicken thigh marinated in teriyaki and spring onion served on a skewer. The Sagari consisted of grilled beef tenderloin marinated in a karubi sauce served on a skewer on top of grated daikon.

For Ramen, we shared the Sapporo Miso Ramen and Nagasaki Ramen. Both of the ramen had the same type of vegetables including mushroom, soybeans, cabbage, carrot, scallion, and bok Chou. The only differences were the type of protein and broth base. The Sapporo Miso Ramen had ground pork in a pork, miso paste, and Sapporo broth whether as the Nagasaki Ramen had squid, octopus, and shrimp in a seafood broth."}
{"text":"The interior decor of this place is very cute and spacious. It definitely got it's wooden Japanese decor on point and the overall lighting in the restaurant is dim, just enough light to see what you were eating and drinking. 

We just got food and didn't order any drinks but maybe next time haha. When we sat down, we got this cool water pumping thing where you have the pump it to get your own water and I thought this was honestly the best thing that I have ever seen at a restaurant! Some might say it's stupid and tacky but I disagree, it was very cute and added a touch of awesomeness!

Onto food, we ordered a bunch of stuff but I'll try to keep it short and sweet. The highlights were the beef wrapped enoki mushrooms, tako wasabi and the skewers set A. Each skewer dish came with two skewers but they were pretty darn massive. Especially the beef wrapped enoki mushroom ones, think of the AYCE Japanese ones but triple the size of it! It very was juicy and delicious. The tako wasabi was probably my favourite dish the entire night (and it's just an appetizer too!). It was flavourful and delicious. The wasabi marinade wasn't too long overpowering either which is good for the first time eaters of this raw octopus dish. The skewers set A, was good and came without enough variety of skewers to try from. It was sorta like a sample dish or a teaser if you will. But you will get a bang for your buck if you get it. 

Here are the not so good dishes...
The mochi yaki, beef skewers and the chicken kaarage.

The mochi yaki was dry and didn't really have any flavour, the beef skewers were chewy and overcooked and the chicken kaarage didn't do it for me either.

It's cute and not as popular as the other izakayas but I'd come back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"Always a good time here! I've been multiple times and the staff are always friendly, food is always good, with a great izakaya atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visit the frozen north only sometimes. But when I do, I forgot how much good food is actually here. The night prior we went to a really loud izakaya place, I liked the vibe and but wanted something more low key. I think because this place had just opened I found such a spot to fulfill that need. Pretty awesome ambiance. dark and intimate. Not too loud. Super friendly staff. Had this frosted beer thing, but actually the cool part to me was the sake selection. Pretty decent and who knew Toronto was so into sake. A decent amount of local sake on the menu. They were sure to serve it cold on a bed of shaved ice. Super awesome. 

Food quality was great. I am a sucker for bacon wrapped anything. But this place had me going with the very tender chicken skewers. I was a fan. But then again I saw frozen north, and that night it had dropped to a point where I couldn't feel my face. So the hot ramen definitely saved my ass. Pretty good. Got the tonkatsu, named \"Kintaro Ramen\", and was in heaven. Tasty, good broth good noodles. Decent flavor overall.

Desert was so so, snow ice with mango. Mango was syrupy sweet. I forgot we are not in California, so produce was not going to be fresh. But overall a pretty good dessert."}
{"text":"I like this place!  Food comes fast.  Friendly staff.  Very competitive pricing for Japanese owned restaurants.  I like their rolls & sashimi.  Fish is fresh.  They have daily specials.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here on a late Tuesday night at 11pm. To our surprise, there were other people eating at the restaurant.

Kintaro is famous for their grilled skewer. We got the the Set A skewers which came with beef strip, pork belly, scallop with sea salt, king mushroom, and chicken breast and cheese. We also added an Unagi skewer which was probably our favourite dish. The waitress recommended us the Manguro Tataki (lightly seared tuna) which we felt wasn't that good. The Tataki and grilled octopus was not fresh. Nevertheless, Agedashi Tofu was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend really enjoyed the pork belly rice but I thought it was only decent. The portion was rather small (not really for sharing).

For value of price, I thought it was expensive for what it was. The bill came to 84 dollars before tips. I would not mind coming back but it wasn't amazing and the fish could have been more fresh."}
{"text":"POLAR ICE BEER! Need I say more? 

This place is adorable--food comes with great service, good drinks, and a chill vibe. In the interest of full disclosure, the noms here are just average. We ordered the mochi bacon, some kimchi udon, wings, karaage, sushi...the works. They all were run-of-the-mill-not terrible-but-not-particularly-memorable-in-any-way drunk food. 

We did order oden which cant be found much anywhere else and it was good(!) so do give that a try when you come here--because, again, POLAR ICE BEER."}
{"text":"One of the Beat sushi places I have been to. Service was good in beginning then towards the end of service the server disappeared. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. The food was very delicious and the service was awesome. We had an array of dishes and they were all very flavorful. I would definitely return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Kintaro located in Church and Wellesley area is actually really good for drinks and snacks. Price-wise it can be on the pricier end and probably better if you went with a group of friends. 

The time I went, we had about 6 people and we ordered to the amount of 20-25 a person. We had a variety of sashimi and also cooked food and some beers. I would say that the cooked food (it was one of the platter deals) is not all that worth it so I think it's better to pick and choose from the menu item instead. 

I would recommend trying it the Grilled Squid - they do a really good job at grilling it and ensure that it is not overcooked either. I liked their amaebi shrimp which if you do the math compared to other restaurants - is actually relatively priced better than do. I think it was maybe $4 a piece whereas other restaurants can easily charge $6 a piece and more. 

Overall I would say it would be a longer while before I return to this spot but I suppose it wasn't too bad of a place. Service was decent and food was good."}
{"text":"The good: a huge mix review for this place. Came twice. First impression I was blown away. The enoki wrapped bacon was delicious, grilled octopus was yummy, and the matcha liquor was quite a sweet matcha alcohol drink (that didn't taste like alcohol at all). However...

The bad: the second time around wasn't as great. The grilled skewers that I ordered didn't have great seasoning, or was super fatty, or simply just didn't taste good. The karaage was not good imo, I've definitely had better. Ramen... Better go to a legit ramen shop. Beed tataki was meh (see what I mean by mixed review)

The ugly: nothing too ugly here.

Neutral: great service, I liked the atmosphere, and drinks were good."}
{"text":"Great lil izakaya place downtown with lots of tasty skewers and Japanese tapas. I especially liked the coconut ice dessert at the end to finish it all off. Refreshing! Perfect little spot to catch up with friends and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"this place has been under new management since about a month ago and the quality of the service and food selection have made a huge improvement since then. they renovated the washroom to match the rest of the decor, the servers/new owner are much nicer, and they added more dishes (i.e. sushi and maki). 
the portion is larger than other comparable izakaya/japanese bars so the prices are very reasonable. i recommend yuke (lightly seasoned raw beef $17), taco wasabi (marinated octopus with green salad $8), and most of their skewers (their specialty). we usually get the skewer sets since they're quick and easy, and you get a good selection of the skewers.
polar beer and beer tower are my fav. as for the sake, i personally like ganbare touchan pack - it's a super cute sake that comes in a paper box! you can have the sake in a little circular bottle on a pile of shaved ice to keep the sake cold and keep its taste. 
my friends and i have fun every time we visit, i'd recommend you'd try it out again if you haven't been here the past one month."}
{"text":"There's a lot of izakayas in Toronto, but nothing quite as friendly, delicious and feel good vibes like Kintaro!

This is my 4th visit with my best friends for dinner, drinks and catch ups. On this evening, we ordered sake and beer for drinks with maguro tataki, tori karaage, kaki karaage, momo mochi, hatsu, karubi, enoki bacon, ramen, gyu don for food. 

Maguro Tataki - I enjoyed the hint of grill taste with citrus, but not as tender as other times I've visited
Tori Karaage - there's a nice balance of crunchy, well seasoned outside and juicy inside 
Kaki Karaage - oysters tasted fresh with a crispy thin coating of panko 
Momo Mochi - chicken and rice cake were both tender with a simple seasoning of salt & pepper, the chicken kept it's tenderness even after it was sitting on our table for 30 mins
Hatsu - chicken hearts was also tender and lightly seasoned, we spritz some lemon on and elevated the taste slightly 
Karubi - beef barbecued right, simple seasoning, but quite tasty
Enoki Bacon - sinfully delicious, especially when followed a shot of sake
Ramen - my friends said it was delicious
Gyu Don -  it's well seasoned and portion plentiful 

Like I said, the vibe is good, music is background, waitstaff are friendly (could probably use a 3rd person on busy evenings). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So we went here for my partner's birthday with a group of friends.  Did not know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised by vibrant tasty food, good drinks and friendly service.  The price points are slightly above average, but the food quality is way above average....so that is your trade off.  Great atmosphere and clean.  If you are planning a visit on the weekend you definitely should make a reservation because this place is hopping."}
{"text":"Well, we all started out too late and the restaurant we wanted to go to closes their kitchen at 10.  So walking back toward downtown, we spotted Kintaro and they close at 1 am!  Friendly greeting when we walked in, and there were a few tables so it looked promising.  First things first, pitchers of very cold Sapporo.  

We started with gyoza and karaage. The gyoza were larger than I expected with tender pork filling.  The karaage could've used some type of sauce to go with.  I was happy they had ramen!  So I ordered the Kintaro ramen and it hit the spot!  Nice tender pork belly and good broth.  The others played it safe with the Kintaro Dons...chicken and red bell peppers over rice.  I sampled one and it was really good!

Great place to come to!  Especially since they are open late.  Service was friendly and attentive!  I would definitely come back when I come back to visit."}
{"text":"*The inside was spacious and not crazy loud in here. 
*I can actually hold a proper conversation and don't have to walk out with a major headache stare at Guu. The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was super friendly, except they forgot our water until the end of the meal.
*I must mention how I was sitting near the grilling station, and I walked out with 0 smell! So kudos to their ventilation system

-Takara plum wine - $11 (glass)
The Takara plum wine had a sweet, fruity flavor without a strong alcoholic taste. 

-Tori Karaage (japanese style deep fried chicken w/ house special wasabi sauce) - $12
The deep fried chicken was not oily, still juicy and remained succulent when cold. However it would have been better if there was a bit more batter as I found the chicken's exterior wasn't crispy enough. I really enjoyed the wasabi in the dipping sauce as it added just a kick to the chicken karaage, a delicious combination! The picked ginger and cabbage was a nice addition to tone down the heat as well.

-Taco Wasabi (wasabi marinated octopus) - $8
The octopus was chewy, but hard, slimy (in a good way) and full of wasabi heat without leaving a burning aftertaste in my mouth. The addition of seaweed was quite nice to cut the heat, but as always, more please as there were only 5 pieces

-Set A Yakitori - $16
--Sanmainiku (pork belly): A bit too salty for me but D said it was ok for him. The pork was juicy and not too fatty, just perfect!
--Cheese Mune (chicken breast with cheese): The chicken was dry and bland. The cheese didn't really help either.
--Eringi (king mushroom): King mushroom don't have much flavor so it needs a lot of \"help.\" Again this was bland..
--Karubi (beef strip loin): juicy and just melt in your mouth.
--Scallop: cooked just right and had good seasoning.

-Mochi Bacon (bacon wrapped rice cake) - $5
It was a bit odd to see that the rice cake was dduk (Korean rice cake) instead of mochi. Nonetheless it was probably one of the better skewer of the night. The bacon was slightly crispy and went well with the rice cake without making it too salty.

-Gyu Tataki (lightly seared beef) - $16
I thought the beef pieces were a bit too thick and tough to chew on. Also, isn't this supposed to be served with a citrus-soy dipping sauce? The beef was quite bland so it really needed some kind of sauce to flavor it up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. Reminded me a lot of the little izakaya joints in Kyoto and Tokyo which always had great food and cold beer. 

I went on an evening where they had a special on chicken skewers and cocktails. 

We ordered almost everything chicken skewer, liked all of them a lot except for the one with cheese. Highly recommend  the stuff chicken wing gyoza. 

Other favourites were the ebi mayo prawns and the octopus balls. 

The beer is super cheap, the cocktails are great and the restaurant is comfy with great service. 

I highly recommend this place, most authentic izakaya spot in Toronto I have been to."}
{"text":"By no means this place has bad food, the Japanese food standard is just automatically increased with other amazing spots in the area and in downtown Toronto. 

It's tapa style Japanese food with a good selection of yakitoris. It's a good idea to come here with a group of people. They also have some hot and cold plates to choose from, but lacking a lot of traditional Japanese dishes to make this place standout.

Came here on a weekday after work and we had to wait ~20mins for a table, so make reservations!!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here after a few drinks for some ramen and was thoroughly impressed. Absolutely delicious. Would definitely come back here again for that alone."}
{"text":"We, literally, stumbled across this place. The place we want to go is closed today. Boy, are we thankful. The staff are very friendly, which is true to what an Izakaya is supposed to be. The decor is very cozy and true to the type of restaurant should look like.
The food. There are a few Izakaya in the downtown east area, and this probably can \"outcook\" pretty much all of them. Their seasoning for all of the food we ordered are all on point. Definitely worth coming back, especially there are still so many \"good stuff\" we haven't tried.

UPDATE : They are definitely grilling specialist. I hate ordering Mackerel in most places because 99% of them overcook them. Not their Saba Shio. It is full of flavour while still very moist"}
{"text":"Kintaro was so nice. They serve delicious Japanese foods, staff are very friendly, I could enjoy drinking and eating for 2 days in Toronto. This restaurant is obviously cozy restaurant. I felt like back to Japan. I already miss Kintaro too. 

If I live in Toronto maybe I'll come here frequently."}
{"text":"The food were really good, especially their yakitori. They have a very good sake selection and a frozen beer as well. Unlike other izakaya, Kintaro focus on simple basic yakitori of different kinds. Not to say that Yakitori goes real well with alcohol. I will definitely go back whenever I want a casual drink with good food.

Only thing I don't like is the neighborhood. When I enter and exit the venue, there were strange people behaving abnormally near the entrance. So, I can't help but worry about safety."}
{"text":"The service is good and the food comes really fast. I like their water pump. Haha very interesting cuz you have to pump your own glass of water instead of pouring it.  
The sashimi and rolls are okay.  Not that fresh and the flavour is not very good. The skewers and the raw beef are good though. I really like the rice cake wrapped with bacon and cheese."}
{"text":"Came here once with my family. The combination of decor and food was nice. My parents had sake (can't recall the name) and they said that they were craving it for a few days. 

We had all types of skewers. Every single one of them were fantastic, but my favourite one was rice cake wrapped with bacon. After, we were served Dynamite Roll and Rainbow Roll. Normally, I don't like rolls, but these were too delicious to pass on. The last two dishes were Nagasaki Champong which was very tasty, but slightly on the salty side and the last dish was the dumplings which were amazing! They were juicy and really big, which I really liked. 

The whole experience was fun and one of the best family dinners I had in a while."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends bday so we made reservation a week in advance. There were 6 of us, but they decided to give us a small table where all of us had to squish together. 

The service is so so. We brought a cake to the restaurant and asked for a knife, plates and utensils. It took the waitress forever to bring it and even worse, the waitress only brought plates... Wheres our knife??? we asked the waitress again and took her another 10mins to bring the stuff. Not impressed. 

The food is not that bad, but ive tried better Japanese food in downtown. One thing i loved, however is the steak tartare."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! First off, this place has awesome decor - a really authentic look with various Japanese posters that you would find in an Izakaya in Japan. I love the nice wood furnishings and table and lamps.

Our group ordered various dishes and they were all very tasty, prices were not bad as well!

The owner recommended some dishes to us. Some highlights include the Ebi Mayo (fried batter shrimp. YUM), the skewer sets (very flavourful and priced well), and the beef tartare (seasoned well and the beef quality was good). But truly, we enjoyed all the dishes there.

Overall, a very solid izakaya and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food: 4/5. I have a soft spot for izakayas, so I was very excited to try Kintaro and the food didn't disappoint. The menu is fairly extensive, having a selection of fish, yakitori and soups. I had the premium sashimi set, which was good, the fish cuts weren't amazing but no fishiness. It does include escolar (aka \"white tuna\") by default, which has been banned in the Japan for the last 40 years due to health effects, but Kintaro subbed it for something else for me. Yakitori were good, I always get hatsu (chicken hearts) and they were tenderized perfectly. I also tried seared tuna which was delicious. 

The service: 2/5. Bad service. The restaurant was completely full, yet they had two waiters who didn't know the menu and couldn't answer any questions. We had to flag them down every time we needed something and never received a water refill we asked for. 

Overall: 3/5. Good food, bad service."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing!  Came here with family for dinner a few weeks ago and everything was delicious.  If you are a fan of Japanese Izakayas (tapas style), then you must try this place.  Izakaya style food is small sharing dishes that is usually grilled or deep fried.  In other words very flavorful.  We ordered some of the typical dishes such as yakitori, Ebi (shrimp) mayo, Gyoza (fried dumplings), Karage (fried chicken), spicy salmon rolls.  The best Karage is still at Kinka (formerly Guu) Izakaya but I would rank their Ebi mayo to be the best so far.  We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I think this place is Korean run though. Place is always my group's go-to for drinks! Food, like many izakayas, is expensive, but when I do order it, I like to get the ramen. Ramen is pretty good. Atmosphere is lively and fun. They also have this cute water dispenser where you have to press the lid down teehee."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday there last night and had such a great time. I made the reservation about 2 weeks in advance since there was about 18 of us, and the place is really small. Definitely make reservations if you're going. Service was wonderful! The staff were all so friendly and attentive. They even allowed me to bring in my own cake since my boyfriend is lactose intolerant. 

Every single dish we tried was awesome! The skewers were so flavourful. The takoyaki was probably one of my favourite dishes we ordered. The sushi rolls were all really great as well. Some of the other dishes we ordered were squid, ramen, gyoza, quail, and fried chicken (amazing). Definitely no complaints about the food or drinks! 

The atmosphere is way more authentic to Japan than some of the other izakayas in Toronto. You could have an actual conversation but it was still very lively. 

Thanks so much for a great night! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad space. Food is mostly fried and tasty. Takes way too long to get your order, drinks, food and bill. Not a place for a quick  bite. If you don't like Izakaya, or looking  for healthy options or are not going with a Japanese person it's not for you. Waiters are nice but not very friendly or helpful if you are questioning what to order.  Other Izakaya's ask you as you are seated if you are familiar with the concept eg. GUU. It's also very loud. Ambience is nice and not as hot as other Izakaya places. It's good if you are drunk or are in a group of people wanting to drink. Pricey. Tataki is 14$. Good but small portion."}
{"text":"Pretty good izakaya. I like that they have robatayaki in their menu unlike some other izakayas in Toronto. I ordered their corn cob, soft shell crab (really good), sushi combo, pork belly and maguro tataki. They have the standard izakaya options like beef tartare, ebi mayo and hot dishes such as stone pot rice and udon but I highly recommend their robatayaki menu"}
{"text":"Kintaro ramen: 5 stars
Ebi mayo: 5 stars

Here are the 2 main reasons why I thought the Ramen was worth 5 stars:
1. The chashu was melt-in-your-mouth and had a good ratio of fat to meat. You also get about 4-5 thin delicious pieces of chashu and surprisingly that's more than most ramen places are offering. 
2. I like how their noodles are al dente. I like the chewiness, so maybe this isn't for everyone. 
Overall, their soup base isn't overly savoury. One of the better ramens I've had. 

The ebi mayo came as a recommendation from our waiter. It was my first time here and wanted to try a popular item there. I was not disappointed, even though ebi mayo isn't a very unique dish and can be found in most izakayas. The prawns were quite large and fried to a perfect consistency of crispy.

Ambiance: 4 stars
A cool and hip izakaya. It was located within the parameters of the Halloween festival at Wellesley and Church so it was very packed tonight so it was a lively place to be. Packed with people drinking and having a good time but not too rowdy. 

Service: 4 stars
Service was a little slow but to be fair, it was a very busy night for them since it's Halloween night. Though they were busy, you could tell they were still trying to do the best they could and they remained great throughout our meal."}
{"text":"This yakitori-ya has a wide selection of charcoal-grilled foods. Chicken was juicy and flavourful but not too salty, ebi-mayo was crispy, and the list goes on. Everything came out really quickly and fresh.

Sake selection is pretty good from what I can tell, and the servers are sociable and seems to be knowledgable about their food.

Polar beer was interesting - I may give it another try."}
{"text":"My first time and my last time ... this is the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. The yakitori/robata chicken heart and gizzard tasted like they were boiled rather than grilled, although the wings are better. The aburi sushi have zero taste. It's almost like I am chewing plain rice. The cooks appear to have zero training. Same for the servers, they can't answer basic questions like what are the various fishes on a sushi platter. And I can't flag them for service because most of the time they stand in a corner chatting, facing away from the customers."}
{"text":"Much better than Guu! Go here if you are looking for the best Japanese tapas in Toronto! Everything on the menu is delicious! A culinary gem in a sea of mediocre Jap restaurants. Authentic atmosphere, fresh dishes, wide selection of dishes. My newest favourite local spot for dinner! 5 stars easily. Update: have been there a second time, food is cold and it's too pricy for what it's worth. Would only go there once for the experience."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am bias..

I love dark and dim drinking places
I love eating skewers and anything bite sizes
I love Japanese food
I love cute waiters

And of course I love Kintaro Izakaya!

We drank:
Polar Beer ($8.50)
Sake Sampler ($14.95)
Asahi Draft Cream Beer ($7.50)

We ate:
Enoki Bacon ($6.50)
Momo Mochi - Chicken Thigh & Rice Cake ($5.50)
Butarosu - Pork Loin & Rice Cake ($5.50)
Gyusagari - Beef Tenderloin ($7.50)
Tori Minchi - Chicken Meatballs ($5.50)

And I want to drink Asahi Draft Tower 3000 ml ($32) with my friends and try more Yakitori items on the menu!

I will be BACK!"}
{"text":"This is another authentic Japanese cuisine of which food comes in forms of skewers that I enjoy similar to Zakkushi. Small restaurant that offers quality food and great taste. Be sure to pair your food up with a nice bottle of sake!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great seating. Great food. Great service. Overall just a solid dining experience. 

Food: must get is the bacon wrapped mochi. It was so good that we got two orders! The seafood pancake is also delicious. Also got their takoyaki which was pretty standard. Their drinks are also BOMB! The First Kiss is worth the $. 

Atmosphere: usually izakaya restaurants are super loud which is fine if you're with a group of friends. But for date nights this izkaya provides the intimate quiet atmosphere that you need. 

Service also extremely friendly and attentive. 

All in all, definitely an underrated izkaya restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Not too noisy, food is good and not too salty. My son loved it better than the other Izakaya places we've been. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Tried most of them well known izakayas, Kintaro is the one of the last two on my list.  Great place to come after work for a drink and some great bar food. I love the Korean twist on some of the items, assuming their owner is Korean. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Best gyoza in town! Also good ramen.  Some of the skewers are good. Some are so so. Too many choices of yakitori"}
{"text":"This is great place for dinner and light drink with authentic Japanese cuisine. Made me write my first review. I tried new menu Kintaro Don today (grilled chicken on rice) and yakigyoza. Chicken was tender and it comes in stone bone which was unique. Rice is crispy at bottom which I liked. Gyoza were very rich and filling. and it looked like homemade. It was too goooood!! Also, It seems all staff are new and very friendly! :) I liked this place but I like this place more now! Must come back"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my experience dining here which I was pretty sad about because I am a huge fan of izakaya. I ordered this drink called the first kiss which the waitress said she made herself. Although she was attentive, she only seemed to care about how the drink was, which I thought tasted decent but nothing mind blowing.

The rest of the food was also mediocre and nothing tasted amazing. I always order beef (or tuna) tataki at an izakaya restaurant as a standard for comparison between different restaurants. The dish at kintaro however, did not impress me too much. The beef slices were really thick and the meat was kind of chewy. 

We also ordered chicken karage, which I thought was the worst I've tried at a Japanese restaurant. The chicken pieces were quite small and dry. It was also very soggy and soft on the outside. The dish reminded me more of poorly made Taiwanese popcorn chicken. The pork tonkatsu was sort of the same. For some reason the dish had a lot of juice in it, which made the outside super soggy and the meat inside wasn't moist either. 

We also ordered the braised pork belly, which I thought was flavourful but it didn't seem like it was cooked for long enough because the meat was a bit tough - definitely not the melt in your melt type of pork belly that I've had at other places. 

The Sapporo miso ramen and the skewers that we ordered were decent. But again, it was nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall I thought the food could have been a lot better. I've read some pretty good reviews about some of the dishes I've tried, which I have no doubt must have been very good. However I did not have the same experience. Consistency is key to any good restaurant. For the money that I've paid I felt like I could of had a more satisfying meal at a different place."}
{"text":"I came here in hopes of finding an izakaya that is on par with Zakkushi - the search continues. Our server was lovely, attentive, and hilarious. He knew the menu well and was able to recommend some dishes. Most of the skewers tasted the same and are bacon wrapped. The menu is not nearly as extensive as Zakkushi. I would come back for the mochi skewer and coconut dessert though!!"}
