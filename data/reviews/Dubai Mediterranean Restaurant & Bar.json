{"text":"So...if you need a place on State Street to relax and people watch while enjoying hookah and delicious Mediterranean cuisine? This is it. The hummus and grape leaves were out of this world. I wish there had been a few more pita strips on the hummus plate, but it didn't deter my partner from literally licking the plate clean. Our meals came with side salads that had a nice light dressing on them. I enjoyed the schwarma, but was sad when it was gone so soon. This is also the best baklava I've ever had in Madison, and I've been here for about 15 years now. The owner was very funny and accommodating; our table ordered arabic coffee with dessert and he read my partner's coffee grounds after dinner. It was a fun night! This is a newer restaurant, only a couple of months in, so they are working on hiring and training sufficient wait staff still. The owner was definitely aware that this is something they are working on, and I look forward to seeing this business grow in the future. I plan to return so I can try their egg plant dish. The food is on point!!   Know before you go: one hookah order can be split between a max of 2 people, the flavors are solid staples!"}
{"text":"We came in around 6:30 on a weeknight and the outdoor sitting area on State St makes this a prime spot to enjoy Mediterranean food, although the tables outside don't fit more than three or so people.  You get a little romaine side salad with your entree with a oil/vinaigrette dressing. It wasn't mind blowing, but it's a pleasant palate teaser.  We started our meal with some baba ganoush, which was super tasty and flavorful. The pita was mediocre in comparison; it was unfortunately dry.  I had the maqbullah with chicken, which I found to be delicious. The eggplant was a little oily for my tastes, but the spices on the chicken, eggplant, and rice made up for that. The yogurt sauce that comes with was a nice complement, a little acidic to cut through all of the savory flavors.  Our waitress was lovely, kind, and attentive. Overall our experience was good and we would come back to try some more of their dishes. I hope Dubai is here to stay for a while!"}
{"text":"Attractive, modern, and clean interior. Friendly and efficient service. The hummus and chicken schwarma were fantastic! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken Shawarma....and believe it or not even more Amazing Service! People working are Amazingly Friendly! I know a lot of Amazing's but it's true!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Went with my Boyfriend who is from Dubai and he claimed that it is more authentic than any other Arabic food in Wisconsin"}
{"text":"I've had better falafel. Fries were good and crispy. Presentation was nice. I really enjoyed the Turkish coffee. Gyro was listed as $11 on our bill instead of the $8 listed on the menu. The gentleman changed it after I asked about it."}
{"text":"As badly as I wanted to have another great Mediterranean restaurant in Madison, this is most definitely not it. I must say I was very impressed, but in the worst way possible.   Somehow they managed to have all of the food, including some sort of salad, absolutely swimming in oil and yet have absolutely no taste. The beef had an ok flavor when you could find it, and the same was true for the shawarma chicken, with the added bonus of being quite dry.   The cherry on top, however, was some of the worst hummus I've ever had. Not only was there more oil than chick peas, but I didn't realize there could be so little garlic or tahini in something called hummus!    If you're looking for tasty Mediterranean, I would recommend going hungry over going here."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time.  Outstanding food and service! The Stuffed Grape Leaves were phenomenal.  The Hummus and pita were delicious.  But the Kebabs is what is going to keep bringing me back! Great Mediterranean food right on State Street."}
{"text":"Poor service, mediocre food.  Very, very disappointing.  Especially since there aren't enough Mediterranean/Middle eastern restaurants in Madison, it was exciting to see a new place open up.  Unfortunately, it's not able to deliver on any count.  Walked in for dinner and the waitress told us to grab a table outside.  15 minutes later flagged down another of three servers (and the owner or manager?) who was working the not to busy restaurant, and asked to order.  10 minutes after that someone finally came by.  When the food came about 30 minutes later, that was the last we saw of anyone.  No check in, no water refill, no bill dropoff.  The food was also pretty mixed.  I had the shawarma, which was a pretty small portion dominated on the plate by a heaping scoop of some really bland hummus.  The chicken was actually good, with interesting, but non-mediterranean flavor.  The rice was cold,  clumpy and flavourless.  It felt either microwaved or left out for far too long.  My dinner partner had the falafel sandwich which was described as bland and dry...just without flavor.  The fries, which looked great, were fried in old oil and were quite bad.  All around a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night, it was quite and just a couple of people. Manager herself was serving the food and drinks, she was kind and sweet. We ordered chicken kebab, chicken shawarma and a falafel starter, everything was presented well and tasted amazing.  She even gave us tropical punch to taste. It was guavas and mangoes, which tasted brilliant. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the grape leaves and lamb shawarma. The beef kebab tasted great, but the meat was a bit fatty. We had great service and also enjoyed the hookah. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my falafel sandwich and fries. The sandwich was fresh and the fries were crispy! Also, our server recommended a drink I've never had called Barbican I think, I liked it and would order again. We sat outside and could still hear the music inside which added to the atmosphere. Good prices!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We sat at the bar and enjoyed our dinner talking to the owner. We ordered the mix appetizer and the falafels are great. I ordered the kebab platter and my husband ordered the beef kebab, and I also got some of the Arabic coffee. The lamb kebab tasted straight off of a street grill, it was incredible. Same goes for the beef kebab. The serving sizes and quality are both more than expected.  We'll absolutely be back, and maybe even make this a regular spot"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim last week for dinner. We got to sit outside, so that was great. Our server was very polite too.  We got hummus to start. I liked their hummus a lot. Their pita wasn't anything special. I've been to places that made their own pita fresh. I don't think this is one of those places.  For my entree, I got the maqloubah. It was delicious. It's fried eggplant with rice and meat. I got chicken with it. Great flavors. I thought the chicken was cooked just fine.  Surprisingly, this is the first Mediterranean restaurant I've been to in Madison. I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my dad. We both had the lamb shawarma sandwiches. Not the greatest. The meat was a bit chewy. The worst part was the wrap which seemed to be gluten free...very dry.  The service was great. Really nice waiter. The other female worker was nice too. Really enjoyed the music as well."}
