{"text":"The food is amazing. If you are into vegan/raw you will appreciate the menu.  I like the costumer service. It is authentic and not pretentiously \"nice\"."}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review. I'm not some amazing blogger. I am just a very happy customer. Went there tonight for an early Valentines dinner with the boyfriend.    -very friendly  -hello right away -very informative  -courteous  -food was fresh -colourful  -very clean  -open kitchen. Very clean   Will definitely be going back multiple times"}
{"text":"This place is organic food heaven on earth!!  There is a real lack for healthy organic food spots in Etobicoke, so I am thrilled to find this close to home and work!   I'll be going there often!! We had the Hercules Thrive bowl and \"chorizo\" tacos and they were delicious!  Washed down with a Ant'Oxi smoothie made of pineapple, mixed berries, acai juice and lemon ... lunch couldn't have been more healthy!"}
{"text":"Favourite spot to get something quick and healthy. Never disappointed. Highly recommend the Latin Wrap"}
{"text":"Delicious! Very satistsfied. The staff is wonderful, great service. I've been a couple of times. I've tried their bowls and tacos and let me tell you.. DELICOUS! packed with so much flavour and such a zen'd out environment. Recommend this place to anyone! :)"}
{"text":"Recently visited this newly opened place in Longbranch. Definitely a nice place to chill with all your health junkies and also for those who really don't care what they eat because most of the things just look delicious with all those ingredients. Love their smoothies and definitely a place you want to go to eat if u don't wanna repent after eating!!   Things are reasonably priced keeping in mind you get what you pay for!! Healthy choices!"}
{"text":"Excellent soups and kale Caesar salad today! Never disappointed with whatever I order there and the portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"Tried the \"Canadian \" breakfast which consists of two quinoa pancakes,veggie sausage, two pieces of sprout  bread,scambled tofu and a salad.  This was satisfying and yummy...especially the scrambled tofu! My only complaint was that the pancakes were on the dry side even after putting syrup on them."}
{"text":"I live in sf and spend time in Ubud Bali. I know my vegan food. This place is top notch with fresh ingredients and awesome flavor  Decor needs work as they took over a Greek restaurant but the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"This place is great I'm not a vegetarian but I really enjoyed eating here. Usually vegetarian food has no taste that's not the case at this place. The salad creations are really good the wraps are really good it's just a great place to eat.   The downside is that this place is ugly on the inside. It do a lot better to make it more inviting to people. The other warning would be to stay away from their sandwiches which are ridiculously small for their value.   If you get wraps and salad you're good to go.  The portions of those items are better."}
{"text":"Gluten free brunch - yes!  Thrive caters to all food tolerances and preferences - Vegans are welcome.   We all opted for the Quinoa Pancakes.  So tasty and filling.  Did I mention that the portions were generous.  They also have a good mix of herbal teas available.  The toasted coffee almond hit the spot.  I will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"This place is so fresh and so delicious. I just ate a gluten free chocolate brownie that blew my face off. It was so good, so chocolatie. Best brownie I've ever had. Great breakfast food and a super chill environment. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"The food is great and really worth going for but there's always a problem with ordering. Today I picked up a salad to go that was meant to have goat cheese on it. I specifically chose this one for the protein/fat in the cheese. When I got home and opened the salad... Cheese is missing. There was also meant to be hemp hearts which were missing and there were only 4 small slices of the red onion listed in the ingredients. I actually just paid over $10 for 2 handfuls of spinach a little alfalfa and a few slices of avocado. I feel very ripped off. The only thing saving this us that I called back and the woman on the phone took my name so I can get the salad replaced next time I'm in. Good thing I live in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Brunch was delicious if a bit slow. Food was healthy and tasty. I had the energy breakfast and my husband had the thrive breakfast. He particularly liked the vegan sausages. We are moving to the area soon and will return to try more menu items! Apparently if you are in a hurry you can call them to order in advance."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and looked up what was in my area and learned about this place. I ordered the House burger (no sides). For 15.00$ I felt I was totally ripped off. I paid an extra .75 for roasted red peppers too and was shocked when my burger came and there was a thin patty, 3 caramilized onions and 2 super thin roasted peppers. The patty was ok, but for 15$ I expected to rave about the burger! I don't intend to be smuthered with a massive food portion either, but I expect to get what I paid for, especially extra if I'm paying extra! When asked how it was, I kindly told the owner my complaint and mentioned the portion size since I want to empower others so that they can thrive along with their business. Clearly she doesn't want to stay in business since I didn't receive an apology or any compensation. Close to 16$ (cause I left a 1,50$ tip) and I had to go down the street and buy 2 pieces of fruit and have organic salad at my friend's BBQ to fill up! I am a small eater, so I wonder if the food was actually organic since I ONLY eat organic and I'm typically full on an apple! Very disappointing - wouldn't return or recommend."}
{"text":"I was surprised they had Paleo options as well. Food was great and so was the atmosphere and service"}
{"text":"Was highly disappointed. The only reason I gave a third star is because they promote healthy living and service was quick. I ordered a vegan burger and it was sooo bland I couldn't even finish it. The Thai coconut squash soup just tasted like a really spicy butternut squash soup, couldn't taste coconut and was definitely not close to being referred to as Thai. I was excited to try this place because of the positive reviews but I'm not sure I'll return.. maybe for their juices because that was the only thing I actually enjoyed about my meal. I will stick to Fresh restaurants downtown because they are equally as healthy but 10x better!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and definitely not my last. Absolutely delicious!  Great for family, kids. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian and was so pleasantly surprised by the flavour, assortment and staff was very helpful in selecting meals for kids and me."}
{"text":"I love the ambience of this restaurant. It's very simple and relaxing.  The food has unique flavors. I got the Burrito wrap, which had a cashew sauce.  The Sunrise Tacos are very good, and all of the thrive bowls sound delicious as well!"}
{"text":"This is new place with the same owners as Kalama take that closed down.  Overall the food is very yummy. Portions are SO small though. And unfortunately very overpriced.  Food service is fast but customer service is seriously lacking.  Place has bad customer service standards and leave tables dirty for hours.  They don't check on how your food is either.  Go for a light tasty meal with good friends and I'm sure you won't mind too much.  But if you like service at all. Then I'd skip it."}
{"text":"I normally love this place and the food is amazing. We need more places like this in TO.  It is always stellar and beyond expectations.  The owner was especially kind and knows I love the pizza ...and accommodated me once when I needed something.   There was only one incident with the service  however.  I called ahead to order my food including a salad.  When I got there, I also ordered a smoothie ...however, the smoothie arrived after 30 mins and after I already finished my meal....and other customers orders that were out in after mine were taken care of first.  It's almost 40 minutes after getting better and an hour after ordering, but still waiting for my salad.  Hence while this place is normally a much better rating, I have to give one star for today's incident only ..ever other day it is 5 stars ....as its not cool to serve other customers first after you out your order in first.  This is not typical and they are super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Great to find this place across from the car dealerships in Etobicoke.  The menu is the usual vegetarian/vegan fare, but more flavorful and refined than other similar places I have been to.  The turmeric lattes are great."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple weekends and while the food and smoothies are VERY good, it'll certainly put a dent in your wallet if you eat here on a regular basis.  With that being said, from the smoothies to even their cookies, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu as every single bit of anything you get is pretty much guilt free. You know you're eating healthy as can be!"}
{"text":"Wow this place ROCKS! I found this randomly while traveling from Toronto back to Detroit (for work). I had the Sunrise Tacos with tofu and the flavors were amazing! It has a cute vibe, friendly staff, and SO many healthy options. I highly recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to come back. :-)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place, met the super nice owner pat and told her about my food concerns and she totally helped me out. Her food is super healthy and amazing. Organic,local,tasty,and healthy, what else can you ask for. Im in the industry and I know the type of food suppliers try to sell us , and thrive puts a lot of effort into making us all healthier. Well done Pat, more people like you should be running our restaurants. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This was a major disappointment.    I ordered an 'iced America I\" and longevity salad to go.  My coffee was ready first.  No ice and still warm.  Asked him to dump some and put some ice in it.  Instead he swished a few more ice cubes which melted instantly and totally watered it down.  Still not cold.  I gulped enough down for room and asked for more ice. Still so warm ice melted right away.  Like drinking water with a slight coffee taste they definitely need to learn how to make an iced coffee.  Salad is just so so.  Great big container full of spinach and a little bit of berries cheese etc.  Although lots of avocado.   Very disappointed for over 19 dollars before tip.  .  ."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visits here. My wife and I have come twice and so far we have tried the Mexican pizza, the Fresca pizza, the house burger, the Liver Lover smoothie, and the banana-almond pancakes. The pancakes for brunch were definitely my favourite. Peanut butter layered on top of the amazingly fluffy pancakes really made for a great treat. The Mexican pizza with the jalapenos was spicy but without them it was delicious. We just ended up picking them off. The house burger was delicious though it was a total mess to try and eat. Each bite ended up more on my plate than in my mouth. The Fresca pizza was fairly bland and not particularly suiting my tastes but I can see the appeal for some. The liver Lover smoothie was great too and I definitely would recommend trying it.  The cafe itself is reasonably sized and it hasn't ever been too busy when we went. Service is fairly quick and friendly but I have to see that there's a weird amount of flies and ants in here. It makes me a bit worried about the food but I think it's because they leave the doors open to the patio.  Still, I recommend trying Thrive. The food all feels so fresh and clean and it definitely helps energize you for the day. Prices are reasonable too so it's worth going to even you aren't normally into vegan type food. We convinced some friends to try it with us on our second visit and they surprised themselves by liking it quite a bit. They seemed to enjoy one of the bowls though I can't remember which one."}
{"text":"This place is a must go if you're in west toronto! They opened in April of 2014.  It is a vegan/vegetarian restaurant with clearly labelled items. They have a large variety from soups, salads, burgers, breakfast and they also have a range of beverages like coffee, and fresh energy juices.    We decided to bring our vegan vegetarian friends here and they absolutely loved it!  The service here is GREAT. Everyone is very friendly. The restaurant itself is really cozy inside with great decor and clean bathrooms. They have these homey benches that you can really relax on. The music is not too loud and you certainly get a nice relaxing vibe.   We ordered for the mains: Classic burger  Sweet potato soup (changes based on day) Lentil soup (changes based on day)  Raw pad Thai salad Burrito wrap Energy juice - cucumber, ginger, celery   All of these items were delicious, great portions and very tasty.  Dessert- Mango cheesecake (v) Acai cheesecake (v) Brownie (gf), vegan available as well Tiramisu (v)    Absolutely so delicious and so light!   We left feeling full, but not disgustingly full. Really great place and I will definitely be returning again! A little gem in west toronto!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for lunch and everyone was pleased but no-one was thrilled. I would describe it to other vegetarian Torontonians as 'the poor man's Fresh', although the prices are comparable.   I had the nut-meat tacos (easily made vegan by omitting the cheese), and they were quite delicious, although I needed more to eat to be really satisfied. That said, I'm a bit of a piggy. So I got one of the daily soups (I chose mushroom), and it was souper (see what I did there?) disappointing. Bland and tasteless despite the copious amounts of salt and pepper I added. I couldn't finish it, which is unheard of for me.   My parents both had wraps (boring!) and they seemed fairly pleased with their selections.   We all agreed that the cookies were excellent, although we thought it a tad strange that they brought us the cookies before the meal. Strange, but not entirely unwelcome.    Thrive seems to be the only game in town in terms of veggie options in Etobicoke (I did choose to move to the suburbs, so I shouldn't complain), and it's a good choice for those wanting healthy, meat-free lunches.   I'm not going to rave about it, but it's decent, the quality of the ingredients is good, and it's a pleasant, casual place to grab a bite. Overall, I won't be eating there every week, but it's comforting to know it's there."}
{"text":"I came by after class last week with a couple of friends from England, who came to visit me at school. Thrive was recommended by a few of my schoolmates because of the fresh vegan options, so I decided to take them there.  Though it seems like a cool local hangout, I wasn't taken aback by it. The restaurant looks more like a corporate cafeteria, than a cozy cafe.   It felt just as impersonal as the vegan chain restaurant, Fresh.  I ordered the detox juice, because nothing really appealed to me on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich, a salad bowl, and 2 large fresh squeezed juices which cost them $50.   We sat at one of the booths, which was still dirty from the previous customers and surrounded by their dead and very sad window plants.  Though I'm pro-local food, this place was a cash grab and I will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Damn vegan/vegetarian cuisine I never knew you could taste so good. Wheeewwww!   Stopped in to this place last week with my Marketing maven sidekick Amy Z for some a healthy take on lunch. It's a massive space on Lakeshore in Longbranch with plenty of parking on the street and a private lot around the back.   I went with something delicious sounding, a green smoothie and a power salad with tons of kale, chickpeas, tempeh bacon and basically everything but the vegan kitchen sink.   It was so fantastic but also... So. Much. Food. I got about 1/4 of the way through my meal and had to call it a day. I was stuffed, but my mouth wanted more.   I'm parked in their back lo right about to go back in and I needed to write this because I cannot believe I forgot.   The minus star is for the cost, for 2 meals a coconut water and the smoothie the bill came to a whopping $50+, however I guess that's the price you pay for quality fresh food  Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch one afternoon and were blown away. The food and juices were fantastic! Will definitely be back when visiting the area."}
{"text":"Given a choice I would have gone for a Big Mac and fries, but I wasn't by my wife.    Had their 'Thrive Breakfast' and it's probably the healthiest thing I've ever eaten! It was really good. Had their 'hot chocolate' and the chocolate mousse desert, both of which were outstanding. Left surprised and not still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"This place was really overrated. The food was just plain bad. The atmosphere was dull and uninspired. And, there were flies around. I blew $80 on round trip taxi to go here for a breakfast from a 6 hour stop-over at YYZ. What a waste."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast. The location is spacious and runs on a simple model, insofar that you order at the front, take a sign, and go to your seat. They also had a large amount of lemon cucumber flavoured water for free at the front.  In my group, we ordered: - the Amigo wrap, which was pretty hefty & came with a small side salad - the weekend banana pancakes - the 'Thrive' weekend breakfast, made one corn tortillas with scrambled eggs (tofu is the other option).  We also got two mugs of coffee, which were hefty one-time portions ($3.25) & I received an iced chai latte made with 2% milk.  The server was very friendly and patient with us ordering, explaining the options. The food was quick to come out (less than 10 minutes) and the portions were pretty sizeable.  I'd like to come back to check out their smoothies & juice options.  The prices were reasonable considering it is organic/vegan offerings, so definitely go in knowing it'll be a little bit pricier than your standard greasy spoon/diner breakfast."}
{"text":"My nephew and I crashed this grass roots venue.  It's a very unique, authentic and refreshing restaurant along Lake Shore Boulevard!  After scanning the healthy choice menu, we settled for the Hercules Thrive Bowl $17.50 with $1.50 add-on of Quinoa, a Mexican Sprouted Grains Pizza $16.75 with vegan cheese, plus a large Dandy Blend Coffee $5.50 for each of us.  Dandelion coffee you say?  Meal orders are placed and paid for at the front counter.  We were given a table sign (Laugh) for display and staff brought us our food.  Music level was moderate but the decor added to an auditorium-like atmosphere.  We could talk but noises, even from the kitchen, made it somewhat loud overall.  The food was prepared quickly.  It was five-star delicious!  The dandelion coffee was a first and it was a thumbs up.  An excellent pricey food experience, however, it was surprising that staff never came back to our table to ask if our meal was okay."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place. I live in Etobicoke and thought I found an alternative to making the drive into the city to go to Fresh. This place was a very weak. Yes there were a lot of Fresh ingredients in the dishes we had, but the overall flavour in the dishes we had were bland. I had the pad thai salad with a peanut sauce that would have made any Thai chef just shake his head in disgust. My girlfriend got the Buddha bowl which was equally disappointing. We tried to add flavour to our meal and asked for their \"hot sauce\". Their hot sauce was pretty much a mild salsa. My girlfriend ordered a The beach smoothie for 8 dollars which is completely overpriced, it was mediocre at best. We left this place both saying, I wish we would have made the 15 minute drive to Fresh."}
{"text":"Veggie and organic... sounds like a healthy combination! And guess what, it taste great as well and the price is not crazily expensive either when making it at home, probably will cost you the same when u buy your own organic ingredient. Actually, I am assuming they are using organic ingredients because the store name suggested it is and I didn't study the menu too details to verify... because I was hungry at the time! ;)  The place is a self serve place where u need to place the order and paid at the cashier first and then they will bring you the food. The place decoration is ok, nothing stand out but still clean and tidy, a comfy place to dine in.  We ordered the pizza, and veggie bowl and the dessert. The food presentation is above average and pretty and  I love the pizza the most(the one with eggplant, avocado, olive...), it's taste fresh and hot from the oven and the taste from the combination of all ingredient goes so well together. I like it!  As per the veggie bowl, the hummus is abit salty but when mixed together with other veggie in the bowl, taste just right. It's good but I like the pizza more.  As for the dessert, ordered the apple crumble, that one is just ok, maybe you can skip that one if u ask me.  Overall a very good experience and also knowing these foods are good for you, couldn't be more happier!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So many healthy vegan options. I had the Mexican pizza made vegan. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my work neighbourhood now. Damn this place is all about being healthy.  Across the street there's a competing healthy meal/juice bar venue. I've eaten at both. Man is eating healthy expensive.  But as expensive as both locations are, this one definitely offers more variety and taste. I had the Serenity Bowl and an All In One smoothie to go. While it did take some time to make, the service was very friendly and helpful. There's tons of seating for people waiting to take their meals to go or even if you want to hang out with your smoothie but not take up seats meant for dining.  From what I've seen, this place is well frequented, despite the price, which could mean that they are ridiculously good, or people here are fairly wealthy, or both. Either way, my bowl was delicious and my green smoothie was fairly good. I have yet to find THE smoothie. However, I know if I'm trying to be healthy and I was tasty food, I've got this option available to me."}
{"text":"My sister took my family here for dinner and I was throughly impressed with the quality of food and service. They serve 90% organic vegetarian food which is perfect option for the healthy concious eaters. We ordered the Hercules with freekah, Bella pizza (eggplant with avocado and pesto), vegetarian burger, and thai wrap, acai bluberry cheesecake..all of which tasted delicious! The ingredients used were so fresh and made to perfection. Surprisingly for meatless dishes, you can be full because the protein ingredients that they use such as quinoa and freekah. The prices are a bit on the higher side but it's definitely worth it for a healthier meal.  I must also comment on ambience because it made the experience more satisfying with an urban welcoming feel and a bright and spacious seating area.   Lastly, service was top notch. The order takers were very friendly and helpful when asked what some of the menu items are like. They also bring the food to you once you're seated.  On a side note, parking is not as accessible with only a limited amout of spots at the front of the restaurant.  I definitely want to come back here to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is fresh and yummy, they always have monthly specials and rotate a few amazing soups. I'm taking off a star because the service is very very slow and because the prices are a little high and because their veggie burgers literally fall apart. Recently got that app so hopefully some loyalty points gives a bit better value. Favourite menu item is the squash quesadilla, you won't ever regret eating that."}
{"text":"Had the Hercules bowl with frekeh and a matcha latte with coconut milk. Absolutely fantastic. The tofu in the bowl was grilled perfectly and the sprouts and veggies were all very fresh."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like a Williams cafe, in that you order at the counter and get a number and bring the number to your table with you for table service.  I took my sister here for brunch one Saturday morning, we were pretty hungry and everything on the menu sounded super good. I ordered the stuffed french toast and she got the banana chocolate-almond pancakes. My french toast was alright, very sugary and buttery tasting. It was definitely not \"stuffed\", but had a couple of pieces of fruit arranged on the side (maybe half a banana, a few pieces of apple, one pineapple wedge, and a slice of strawberry). We expected my sister's pancakes to have bananas, chocolate chips, and maybe some almond slivers, but it came covered in some sort of chocolate sauce. The quinoa pancakes are gluten-free, so I can't really say much else. They're standard gluten-free...grey, heavy, like they're made of gruel or something. I also got a matcha latte, which was essentially warm almond milk with green, because it did not taste one bit like matcha. Anywho, maybe I will return for a snack or lunch or something to that effect, but otherwise, I will likely not revisit Thrive because, in my opinion, there are better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sorry I'm really annoyed.  Barely anyone is here and it's taken more than 30 minutes for my food to arrive.  This is an unacceptable.   I was told there was a catering order and if there is, there should be more people working.     Not very organized. It's a long commute for me but my food shouldn't take longer than my commute.  Oh wait, now they were saying the tofu wasn't ready even though it was one of their main brunch items and people with the same dish were served before me... don't lie to me.    Just say the orders got mixed up and I'll be understanding. Lie and I really hate it.  Done with this place"}
{"text":"This place is super cozy & welcoming. Healthy but delicious menu ! Quesadillas were tasty and filling, also tried a couple of the bowls. Whole menu is great !"}
{"text":"Food is great. A good transitioning place for people who are trying to become vegan or vegetarian. The friendly staff told me about a water stain on the booth I was going to sit in so that I wouldn't go on it, and I didn't even notice the stain to begin with. Their market downstairs is nice."}
{"text":"Great organic restaurant with LOTS of options (gluten-free, raw, vegan, vegetarian, etc.). They also have good portion sizes for a hungry big guy like me. I ordered the tacos (combo'd with a salad) and a double chocolate quinoa banana muffin (very moist). The only downside is that it's a little pricey...but the food is good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot when I'm in the Etobicoke area. There are endless healthy and delicious options to choose from. I always end up ordering the Amigo Wrap, which is actually from their breakfast menu just because I love it so much.   The decor is lacking but it doesn't really bother me, I just wish it was closer to the city!"}
{"text":"Great food! Love the vegan options I had the Canadian Platter. It was delicious! The coffee (Americano) was excellent and they have Kombucha which was a nice surprise. Definitely a good place for Brunch with my not-vegan husband (they have eggs and cheese). Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"ETOBICOKE, YOU ARE SO LUCKY!  Baby, this is what I came for.  Lightning (in my stomach) strikes every time I see this food.   Never would've discovered this place if it weren't for the amazing CM of the GTA ;) We had some work to do and he chose this place in his hood. Oh, I'm so jealous. Thrive is a huge place and has plenty of comfortable seating, booths and even a couch? Everything is vegetarian and most things are vegan. They have stuff that you'd only see in hip places like Cali, or SF. To have one of these around toronto is something special indeed.   Everything looked amazing but obviously carbivore me had to go for the buddha bowls, as that's what I often make at home - filling and DELICIOUS. I had the serenity bowl which consisted of kale, avocado (NOMMM), brown rice at the bottom and all sorts of delicious veggies in between. Holy, was it ever good. One bowl could've been shared between both of us - we had no idea they'd actually be THAT big. 100% would order again as yo' girl loves the kale. The smoothies looked bomb af too, definitely better than regular ol' booster juice.   This place proves that vegan food can be delicious as well as nutritious and that vegans do not simply 'eat air' (yes, a real statement that has been said to me once before..)   On one hand, I'm jealous that this is in so many people's hood. On the other hand, my bank would literally cry if one opened up near me."}
{"text":"Great to have a place like this in the west end !!! All around great experience .. From start to finish. Will be back for sure. Decor nice. Place very clean. Food exceptionally fresh. Juice was lovely. Dessert was decadent, yet healthy. Staff courteous and informative. Yes.. Five out of five !!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Definitely pricy as mentioned by most reviewers below. However, some meals give you a lot more than others for what you pay. For instance, the Hercules bowl could definitely last you two meals (and I thrive on huge portions). The Longevity salad is great as well, probably good for two people to split with something else or good for a lighter lunch. The House burger is also good, however tiny for what you pay. However, it's filling!  I have tried any coffee or beverages in general here, but the cookies are also tasty. One tip would be to place your order via phone and then pick it up to save time. Otherwise, it's always busy and you can easily spend 8ish minutes waiting in line, alone. Overall good - but pricy!"}
{"text":"The nachos were delicious but my absolute favorite was the burrito. I recommend adding mushrooms to the burrito. I also had the anti oxi smoothie. Pretty good but lemon was pretty overpowering in the smoothie."}
{"text":"So fresh and so delicious. I have never had a dish at thrive I haven't liked. The only reason I am not giving it a 5/5 is because I have never liked any of their coffee drinks. But seriously their food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a restaurant like this closer to my home.  The breads, soups, juices, entrees, desserts, etc. Made as God intended. I guess for now I'll visit whenever I'm in the Toronto area. The Hercules Thrive Bowl is worth a try. It's a tough decision though with their menu... Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly, helpful. My only real complaint; prices are expensive. Enjoyed a salad, almost $14 (w dollar tip), if 2 people wanted a salad, drink. Looking at a good 30plus/40 dollar meal.  Expensive."}
{"text":"This was a great find during a short trip to Toronto. Fortunately one night we were staying near the airport so stopped at this place for dinner. It was a welcome change from the cramped eateries in downtown. The ambience was great.  I had soup of the day, the power house bowl with freekeh, and a macadamia tiramisu to go. Everything was exceptionally good!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, but good food. I've liked everything I've had there, and I've been three or four times.  Atmosphere is nice, a good place to do work occasionally, since they have wifi that worked. It's a convenient place for me, but when I brought my vegan friend there, he wasn't especially impressed."}
{"text":"I have no idea what other folks are talking about when they say food is bland. It's quite tasteful. Maybe it's coming from folks who have been conditioned by the food industrial complex to like it sugary, fatty, and salty - like the way most restaurants serve it. Hint: sugar and fat make you crave and eat more so they can drive revenue and tips, and salt makes you drink more so they can drive their profit margin.  For a part-time vegan, part-time carnivore, and full time believer that sugar and wheat are the devil reincarnate, this place is a hit. It's fast foodish enough for quick service, trendy enough on the eyes, and healthy enough on the lifestyle choice.  I ordered one of their bowls with quinoa. The food they prep is high in the right fats (e.g. they use avocado), high in protein (they make their own protein replacement - look for phrase \"grain & nut\" based on almond, and then add in other protein sources such as legumes based items such as hummus), low in glycemic index raising carbs (they use quinoa or brown rice), and with enough fiber from fresh green veggies (e.g. sprouts) to feel like I am eating a proper home made meal and *not* just some nutritionally empty lettuce you get from other \"healthy\" places.  I am both coming back again and recommending to friends.  Oh yeah, and service was fast and furious - I ordered ahead of the time, it was ready as ordered and as promised. 4 and a 1/2 stars because they didn't accept AMEX. but hey, nothing is perfect."}
{"text":"Love the fresh and delicious options this place had. I had a Thai wrap and a specialty drink. Both were great. Staff were also very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice place for brunch.  Went today with my wife and mother in law.  My wife & I are vegan, my mother in law is not.  I had the Canadian something, it was a couple of pancakes, scrambled tofu, tempeh strips, a salad and bread, my wife had a mediterranean breakfast with scrambled tofu, and my mother in law had the same with eggs over easy.  The food was good and filling.  It could have been a bit hotter, but I wasn't bothered enough to send it back.  The coffee was very good too.  We'll be back, I'd like to try some of their sandwiches as well as sit on the patio.  The place is quite large, and the seats are comfortable.  They've also got a section with a couple of couches around a coffee table.  The prices were reasonable - we paid about $15 each.  Not cheap, but not expensive either."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch with my son. He ordered a Budda bowl and ice tea. I enjoyed burritos on gf tortilla and a C Buster juice. The fireplace was on and the place was warm and cozy on a cold winter afternoon. The place is clean and fresh and the staff is friendly and helpful. We'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 Star Rating. Really healthy, really vegetarian, and really well plated. But why 3.5 star you may ask? Two mains + one coffee + one dessert came out to $50 at a self serve restaurant. Is it just me or does that strike me as a bit pricy for the set-up? To be honest I can't put my finger on if it's going for the healthy fast food alternative or the sit down dine-in. It felt like a dine and dash so I'm not sure where to peg this restaurant. I'm more a herbivore, than a carnivorous t-Rex in the hunt for the next meat plate that can be torn off the bone, but it just wasn't that leafy or tasty.   The food was very healthy and well plated, but not as good as it looks. I felt like a cow chewing on grains and my jaw was sore after a couple of bites of freek-eh (Wheat cereal that's freaky hard to chow on). The Hercules salad bowl has a strong curry flavor but the texture was very rough and one dimensional in taste. Sprouts were too over grown which again added to the rough and beastly texture of the bowl. No wonder it's called Hercules and not Aphrodite.   The pizza was much tastier in comparison. Though not even close to the ones I've had in Rome and Naples. Crust was crispy, dressing drizzled over was also overpowering in taste and took away the art of it all. At least there was more variety and an array of different flavors with different bites. Dessert was good but grainy.. And it was supposed to be a Black Forest cake/pudding.  Great food presentation though one recommendation for this place is work on food texture, but love the concept of providing a healthy/organic/vegetarian alternative. Service was great- Kevin was very helpful, patient, and attentive. Place was clean, spacious, and inviting. Overall a good experience but can't say I'm a huge fan of the food."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit dining at Thrive. I ordered the Serenity bowl added Freekeh. I swapped the regular Spirulina dressing for Tahini Camu dressing. The sweet potatoes were nicely seasoned. The avocado was really tasty too. This had lots of visual appeal and was just enough for my partner and I to share. It definitely had enough fresh ingredients to be worth the price.   Some people might find it weird to pay 15.00 for a lunch but most places these days are at least 12.00 I have noticed so I recommend coming in with no more than a medium-sized appetite if you are looking to be mindful of prices.  I will definitely come back again. And most likely with more friends to try the Sprouted Pizza."}
{"text":"Lovely staff but slow to make the latte coffee, we were finished our cookie and muffin long before the coffee arrived.   Good menu selection of healthy food. They even have brunch! We want to try the wraps and the stuffed French toast  :)"}
{"text":"I had completed a 5K run in the morning and was starving when our group arrived here. Thankfully, they have a spacious and large restaurant inside with a sizeable patio outside, so there was no need to wait for a spot. Trying to choose from the extensive menu took much longer. They have everything you could possibly want for lunch from pizza, wraps, sandwiches, bowls, salads, and smoothies. The best thing is that you can be guaranteed whatever you choose will be healthy, fresh and filling. Once you make your decision, order at the counter and they bring your delicious meal to you.  I had the burrito wrap and it was exactly what I needed after a run. It was filling, killed my hunger, gave me the energy I badly needed but didn't put me to sleep. It was the perfect choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday. There was a steady flow of customers but not too busy. My son and niece had coffees and I had a matcha green tea latte, unsweetened, with coconut milk. We all enjoyed our drinks. My son had the chocolate banana pancakes and my niece had the berry pancakes. Both were delicious and satisfying. I had the thrive breakfast with beans, tofu, etc on crunchy corn tortillas and a side salad. This was tasty and I had to choose the tempeh bacon (meh) as the sausage had wheat in it. I grabbed 3 gf, vegan muffins to go and the bill was approx. $60 in total thanks to the veg card discount. I love this place! Big and open with lots of seating. Clean but small washrooms. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had there was delicious! Food just explodes in your mouth with a combination of tastes and flavours. Just really good and fresh. You feel really good after a meal there and I've been 3 times already."}
{"text":"I'm not a health food nut by any means (I'm a Lays chip, \"can't have just one\", kind of girl). But recently, I've made more of an effort to look at healthier meal options, and, after noticing fellow Yelper check-ins here, I thought I'd give it a shot - verdict: we really liked it! Located in Etobicoke, just west of Lakeshore Road West and Kipling Ave, we had no idea this place existed, but it's certainly accessible and a great option for organic and/or vegan meal options in the west end - good for your soul + body!  They have a pretty extensive menu that offers brunch, lunch, and dinner options. We ordered the 'Soup of the Day' (on a Monday, it was a Cream of Ginger and Sweet Potato with Coconut) which came with sprouted grain bread, the 'Fresco' pizza which had a variety of vegetables as toppings, and a Mocha Latte (which was a little too bitter for me - I'd pass on this next time).   The food itself was delicious, the pizza had a great drizzle of sauce, and the soup had a number of flavours thrown in that worked really well together - I actually didn't miss my meat at all! Portion size was also more than I expected and quite generous - I was surprised at how uber gigantic the soup bowl was! Our meal worked out to be a good amount for two people.   Note that its a bit pricier than your average casual diner (but for what it is, and what you're getting, I guess the price point seems fair). Ambiance is casual and easygoing but still with a modern feel. There's plenty of seating so it could definitely play host to a family dinner out or a dinner with a group of friends.   For our entire order, with tax, our total was around $29.00. I'll definitely be back for brunch and those quinoa pancakes!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Vegetarian restaurant I've been in and I've been in Vegetarian restaurants all around North America.  Not only the Best vegetarian restaurant but one of the best I've had the pleasure to eat it.  Such a creative menu!  So tasty with an obvious love for creating exceptionally, tasty and healthy meal choices.  Don't forget to try the Tumeric Late for the surprise drink of the year."}
{"text":"This place is an organic vegetarian heaven! My husband and I came here for lunch two days in a row. The food is great - fresh, delicious, and satisfying.   So far we have collectively tried the amigo wrap, alkaline salad, house burger (husband got this two days in a row), and the verde juice and detox juice...all were perfect. The burger patty was a bit messy because bits of it kept falling out the burger. However, the taste makes up for it!  This is the kind of place where you order at the front, grab a seat where ever you like, and the food will come out to you. Which makes it a nice, laid back atmosphere. Yes it is pricey, however when you think about all the organic ingredients that go into each meal and how everything is made fresh daily, the price does make sense.  Also love the sense of community this establishment has towards the Long Branch area and how they promote healthy living! I picked up a handful of business cards from a table near the front door, on my way out...for yoga, salsa, and a nutrition seminar.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Venue - inside is very cafeteria-esque and they have a large patio, but it is always shaded by the sun in the evenings--- so we usually take our food to go and sit by the lake :)  Food - Been here a couple times, the Amigo wrap and the nachos were pretty good! Their food is good in a very homey, no frills, simple way. Don't expect spicy or really innovative options here.   Their baked goods are also pretty good (all around 3-4$ ea) - Sweet potato muffin (GF) was amazing and very moist and chewy. The coconut macaroon was ok - the lemon flavour is a bit strong and almost gives the cookie an off taste. Brownie was good, but very dense!   Overall - would return if in the area. Prices are a bit steep, but good simple healthy food :)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we now have a veg restaurant in Long Branch! The space is very large with tall ceilings, love the large booths and the fireplace, this restaurant is great for families and can accommodate large groups. I recommend asking for tofu scramble, very tasty and love their house white wine.. Yes, they're licensed!! There are some minor kinks like the confusion/mix-up over orders (they need a more efficient way of serving ordered food) and rock-hard over-baked corn tortillas but everything else was great! The washrooms are spotless, they even have a change table. I will keep on coming back to sample everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great environment. My favourite is the amigo breakfast wrap and their local blend coffee (birds and bees) is to die for!"}
{"text":"Pricey but get fresh and generous portions. Nice environment. Good selection of food, cold and hot drinks. Friendly service.  Free parking after 6pm on weekends."}
{"text":"If you want fresh, healthy, and tasty food this is the place to visit.  My partner and I both enjoyed the food and the service.  The space is bright, modern and open.  Be prepared to spend a bit more for higher quality products, but it is well worth the splurge.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD!  Think the suburb version of \"Fresh\". Almost everything is organic, vegan, and mostly gluten free as well. Huge menu, everything we've ever tried has been super tasty, there's some creative menu items, and there's tons of room in its casual space.   Only thing I will say is everything is pretty pricey (probably to be expected with that kind of quality), they're not the best at coffees (lattes come out MOLTEN for example), and if you're into huge potions you won't find them here (but it's definitely enough food).   Really nice people, very nice space, and a welcome change to some of the grub in the area. Tons of easy parking, and a pretty great place to patio in the summer if you're into that, too!"}
{"text":"A little expensive when compared with non-organic equivalents, but definitely tasty healthy food"}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian tacos and they smelled just like homemade meat tacos! Yum! They didn't taste the same obviously but they were still really good, healthy, and well presented."}
{"text":"Everything is organic...  Friendly service, free wi-fi and delicious foods and drinks.   Their juice is freshly squeezed and their lattes are scrumptious as well.   Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Really good and worth the drive to Long Branch from Mississauga!  We have Raw Aura (in Port Credit) and Freshii in Heartland, but I've never been.  With Raw Aura, I do miss the heat of the food.  Don't get me wrong, it IS good, but the service isn't very pleasant, and I find the serving sizes quite small for the price.  Average prices at Raw Aura are around $14/main.  I've also been to Fresh, had one of their bowls, which was very delicious!  So that is my experience with raw/veg food.  Atmosphere:  I was quite surprised by the size of the interior.  This place is HUGE!  In addition, there is a large patio on the side of the building AND parking in the back - *BONUS* for suburbanites like me.  Interior is bright, clean, with lots of seating!  Food was delicious and surprisingly, not as expensive as I thought it would be.  I ordered the tacos and it was $9.50/3, yum!  And Thrive sprouted pizza was $12.  Both servings were quite filling and it woke up my innards.  I don't know if it's a placebo effect, but I felt the opposite of lethargic.  Menu was quite diverse and anyone will undoubtedly find something to eat, even if you're a meatarian!"}
{"text":"YES. Healthy. Delicious. Fast. And expensive. But I don't mind it, so now you know how much of a yes it is:)"}
{"text":"It's a very nice place. I'm not a vegan but went with one. I had the thrive salad which was great. Very helpful staff. If your vegan you'll absolutely love this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good but expensive.  All in all, i'm impressed by the flavours, but just can't justify the prices charged.  It's a spot to remember, but I can't see myself coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Ordered their thrive burger with kale and apple slaw and their powerhouse bowl with soba. My favorite was the bowl. Portion is ridiculously enormous with a ton of veggies: arugula, chickpeas, red cabbage, avocado, tempeh, sweet potatoes, carrots and sprouts plus a lemon basil vinegrette.  Looking forward to try their pizza, Canadian brunch platter and desserts especially that tigernut tiramisu.  It is quite pricy so not something to frequent often but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Whole family had a surprisingly awesome meal. Everything very fresh. Restaurant very clean and has an awesome atmosphere. They were also quite busy.  Staff was very helpful as well, due to me not even being a vegetarian. I admittedly didn't even know the names of some of those vegetables. I was actually shocked at the variety of tastes in the dish I chose.  It was a bit of a gamble for me going here but I wanted a fill of vegetables (which I'm usually lacking) so I chose the Hercules bowl and it was such a substantial portion, I was stuffed at the end. Still had room for a brownie though!  Top marks all around. Also some of freshest (not too sweet) lemonade I've ever had. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. I had the Hurricane bowl and it was delicious. I had it with the \"Freekah\" (instead of brown rice) which the waitress explained was an Australian grain that tastes like corn/barley.   Would definitely eat here again. The washroom is very clean, which is a bonus."}
{"text":"We had the Stuffed French Toast and Canadian Platter. I was thoroughly impressed!   The fruits were fresh and the french toast was delicious. As someone who is not vegan myself, I enjoyed trying a place that served delicious organic food. Support restaurants who support local and fair-trade suppliers!  The quinoa pancakes were delicious! They tasted like bananas and coconut milk, super soft and had an interesting texture, but I really liked them! The kale salad helped balance out the meal. The sprouted toast was soft and filling. If you're super hungry, this is a great meal to get!  The food tasted great, presentation was beautiful, and the restaurant had a great, relaxing atmosphere. Perfect for weekend brunch or all-day breakfast in the afternoon! Will definitely be back to try their main menu items :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Truly. It's great energy, the food tasty, they're mindful of allergies and food requirements. So why 4 stars?   The price.   I'm all for organic. It's all I aim to eat, and I'm learning the longer I'm in Toronto, the harder it is to find.   So, I know my prices, and I'm aware of how to make most things on the menu. Many are time consuming, and as a staffer pointed out, \"You can make the chocolate mousse at home easily. You can't the raspberry chocolate 'cake'\".   Still, $23 for a burger and a loony-sized salad seemed extreme. $13 for a piece of cake, same thing.   Yes  it was delicious. I'll likely return. But the pricing is off. I mean, at least give me a handful of salad for my side. I literally finished what I had in one bite.   The ambiance is coffee house hipster chill, the WiFi free, the staff friendly, the bathrooms clean.   I'd sit here daily and work, if it were a bit more affordable."}
{"text":"I always order the same thing - the coconut ceasar. Huge portion, super delicious and filling. I always feel good about my choice of food.  The coffee is great too, and its a nice patio.  Also the bathrooms are super pretty (haha)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Food was delicious- we had the protein burger, chickpea squash soup, a wrap and the black forest cake. Service was excellent. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great REAL food in the neighbourhood! Had a salad and it was the perfect size and balance of ingredients. If you're looking for something heartier they have a great varied menu. Can't wait until I'm in the area again! Will definitely make an effort to drop in for lunch and maybe even get one of the baked goods for a snack :)"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, totally mouthwatering delicious food! Huge clean restaurant! Freshhhhh food!! The raw dip trio was to die for! You must try it as well as the pizzas!!   I wonder how breakfast is!?  The menu is huge! I am not vegan and neither is my boyfriend but my sister is and we all are obsessed and definitely are coming back again this week!   90% organic Local produce - OMG  No artificial preservatives  A+++"}
{"text":"Wow thrive what happened I usually come in and get my food in 5 minutes today over 20 minutes and no air conditioning in here today and cash only. No excuses are going to help in this case shape up we are paying good money for your food and  expect better service."}
{"text":"I usually don't think much of organic places, but Thrive made me rethink my whole life. Especially the pretty brunette that works the counter, I would eat grass and ride a bicycle to work to impress her.   Thrive has very interesting items on their menu. The Squash Quesadillas was a real delight."}
{"text":"Had brunch here and ordered \"Thrive Breakfast\" which is a tortilla with scrambled eggs and guacamole and black beans and salsa with tempeh bacon.   Tasted amazing!! The Portions were  perfect as well.   And I also shared a stuffed french toast. So much fruit!    Will be back"}
{"text":"I got a salad today.  Some of the greens were wilted and old at the bottom.  Avocado was very mature and brown in areas.  Some almonds but not in all areas of the salad. Overall very disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"this place is so darn good. Have been here a number of times over my lunch break (its worth the drive) Standouts include the Tacos, and the Fresca pizza. It's a pricer lunch, but I'm always walking away with leftovers....I keep bringing more coworkers here and they are all in disbelief how good a veggy/vegan place can be."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place wont last. The salads are so bad. They try too hard and came up with this odd coconut dressing that was awful. Same owner as the previous Greek restaurant. I think their old menu was better. Will not be back. Food was not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Ordered our dessert 15-20 minutes before we had to leave. They're pre made. They wouldn't give us our $30 desserts even though they were sitting on the counter right in front of us, and paid for, even though we had to leave, because they were \"in cue\" WTF....So we left with no refund, no dessert and complete awe in the face of such inefficiency."}
