{"text":"Oh what a joke. Sushi looked like store bought california rolls (and tasted like them). The food was bland, and not very hot. We visited on my birthday on a whim, and everything from the dumplings, to the soup (which had zero flavor for hot and sour!), to the main dishes (oily mushroom chicken--ew) were just so disappointing. 

The service didn't even seem to be at all interested in being there, but I don't blame them, and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Its an average buffet, food is good and the service well was non existent.  No matter server cleaned off our table between getting new food and gave whatever we asked for but don't expect them to ask if your doing Okay.

One side note was the orange chicken had orange peels in it which is rare to find at a buffet."}
{"text":"China Olive in Sun City was wonderful. The service was very good, prompt and cheerful. They took away dirty dishes at a good pace and refilled drinks quickly. Large variety of foods and organized very well. Everything tasted great and looked and tasted fresh. Now you can tell that it is a work in progress. The decor is still from previous tenent but you can see that they will be changing that out as they can. Although the rug is old, they were very good at cleaning up after guests left, sweeping and making sure things were tidy. 
Overall I truly like this place very much."}
{"text":"This has be the worst Chinese food around. Everything tasted the same, whether it was orange chicken or Sesame chicken. Just awful we won't be going back. They won't miss us the staff just about ignored us. Try Tolleson chinese it's great!"}
{"text":"we ate there about 3 months ago for dinner on a weekday. the food was terrible. out of all the dishes on the buffet, only 2 were edible. the crablegs were old and they only brought out 1 tray during the whole time we were there. they never brought out anymore. dont no how they stay open."}
{"text":"Terrible food, almost everything was tasteless. The crab legs were not only tasteless but also water logged. The one thing I enjoyed, slices of tuna, was never refilled. The meat was dry and tough, especially the ribs. Every shrimp I looked at had dirty veins in it. Too bad bc I live 3 minutes away."}
{"text":"landlord who got rid of Furr's now wants me to patronize? No way! Boycott!"}
{"text":"Visited Sunday 6/22 at lunchtime.  Was surprised that it was so dead.  

Interior was clean, service was decent.  Food was not so great.  There was a big selection to choose from, sushi, soups, also the mongolian grill.  Unless you get the grill, your food won't be hot.  There was steam coming out of each container, but the food was barely lukewarm.  Weird.  Wanted to try it, but won't be back.  We miss FURRS!  :)"}
{"text":"Worst buffet ever. Food was horrible. Dishes were dirty service sucked. Waist of time and money.  Shut it down."}
{"text":"This is one of the bigger buffets in this part of the metro area and offers a wide selection of standard Chinese buffet dishes, most of which I found to be quite well made. The quality of their of sushi - a trick item in most buffets - is quite good, as is that of the non-standard items they offer, such as Korean kalbi. This is a good place to dine along the western Grand Avenue / Rt. 60 corridor."}
{"text":"First time at this local restaurant drawn by a newspaper coupon. It was 12:30 pm lunch on a Thursday returning from estate sale hunting in the area. My first concern was the few cars in the lot in this busy area. No matter decided to give it a try.

We were seated quickly by a pleasant young Chinese guy near the first row of the buffets. Interior is old but clean and functional. Kitchen staff were mostly busy young Hispanic males.

Being a sushi guy went right to the cold bar. Here sushi is California rolls. Also peeled shrimp squid and jellyfish. Wasabi and ginger cocktail sauce was all quite cold and pretty good.

My lady went for hot food. The hot dishes looked very cool. Lo mein and other noodles were completely flavorless and all the hot food although visually appealing had virtually none of any detectable Asian spices.

The hot and sour soup was inedible and is one of my favorites in this cuisine. Many hot foods were too sweet and salty.

Fried items like crab puffs egg rolls died a painful death long ago and were then resurrected .

I ate some greenbeans about half of which should have been served.

And I really wanted a good Kung pao and soup today. Save your money go somewhere else. Ming and gee is a San Francisco china town populare compared to this place. The tab 20 bucks. Worth ??

And one of the employees apologized for the food being \"awful\""}
{"text":"Were from Boston home of amazing Chinese food such as out of Asia and Kowloon,price was very fair,food was good, not a bad little spot , we go with kids and like it."}
{"text":"This place is re-opened under new management or something.  A Christmas tree in the lobby with a fountain that is not operating. Place looks a bit grungy, stained  floors, carpet; don't touch the condiments. The food leaves a lot to be desired, dry & tough, maybe on the steamer too long.  Food counters dirty, especially by the desserts.  Ice cream bins were very low and an elbow would rub against the side of the container to get the ice cream treat out.  Womens rest room not clean with empty soap dispenser. I could hardly enjoy the meal wondering what touched what.  Fresh foods to be stir fried sat stagnant on the counter.  I'm not going back.  I'm tempted to call the health department"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Chinese buffet. Not great, but good food and the price is reasonable. I have not had the problem of the food being cold which I have seen from other reviewers. Overall I like it and would return."}
{"text":"Just another below average Chinese buffet in the West Valley.  It's a shame that no one on this side of town can get it right.  I have to travel about 40 mins from my home (in Peoria) to get a GOOD Chinese buffet.  
To put it bluntly, China Olive is just alright.  It's nothing to write home about.  What it IS is over-priced from what they offer.  
The first time I went (yes, I've been there more than once) was their 2nd day of operation and it showed some potential.  Everyone was nice, the food was warm, the place was clean......everything was fine.
I returned about 2 weeks later.  It was still good.  Although the food was starting to get old under the heat lamps, and there wasn't much sushi out but it was OK.  Service was good, the servers were pleasant. 
I returned about 3-4 weeks later and what a transformation.  It's like the whole place went to pot.  The interior of the place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while.  The hostess barely said anything (kinda acted as if we were disturbing her) and the food had obviously been sitting under the lamps for too long.  I hate to assume but it was probably let over from lunch.  Everything was hard and tasteless.  Like someone said before, everyone can have a bad day.  I'm still deciding on whether or not I'll return.  If they don't turn it around soon, I don't think this place will last a year.  What started out very promising has done a complete 180.  Oh well........I guess I'll still have to drive 40 mins to get a good Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Fresh. That is the word.to describe.the China Olive buffet in sun city.  Stopped here on awhim.for lunch and am extremely impressed.  The food is clean, light flavorful and fresh much variety with smiling staff and relaxing atmosphere.  You will absolutely agree after your visit....give it Try great value for the money, definitely I will be back   two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"If you want food poisoning, this is the place to go! The sushi rolls were hard which means they were sitting there for quite awhile. Most of the food that was left in the bins were noticeably old, but never changed. Even the desert was hard as a rock (brownies, cakes, etc). One bite of the cantaloupe was enough to make me gag. Looking at the rest of the food that could be \"prepared\" for you was ghastly. The raw meat had been sitting so long it was dried out. I'm really not sure why this place is open because it's clearly got enough code violations to shut it down."}
{"text":"It was just okay, might go back but nothing that I was excited and need more of. My daughter appreciated all the fresh fruit but honestly that was all that she ate."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this zero stars.  Everything I tried was tasteless and questionable. There is no fresh sushi here..only imiatation crab / cream cheese type things.  The hot and sour soup LOOKED like it may be ok, but it was tasteless, even when adding a bunch of soy sauce.  The wontons I threw in for flavor were also flavorless and a very odd texture-like pork rinds or chiccarones? - they kind of dissolved in the soup. GROSS.  The ice cream was a scoop-it-yourself from old Baskin Robbins pails..I didn't try it, I was scared.  I was surprised I wasn't sick from this. Even the packaged fortune cookie at the end was disgusting. They still have decor from the old restaurant...photos of steak and baked potatoes. Very odd. The carpet is old and dirty. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Chinese buffets.  After a graduation ceremony last night for my oldest son we decided to give this spot a try.  Never again.  NEVER.  Food was luke warm at best - NONE of it was to temperature.  Stuffed mushrooms were like little hockey pucks,  Chinese ribs were tough as horse meat, sushi was subpar and unimaginative, they were leaving pans until the last scrap was gone instead of refreshing them thus making what was left to choose from dry and tough - the place was pretty empty and after being seated we were pretty much ignored on drinks.  I am be generous here when I say their food tasted like all of the other buffets dropped off their day old food here to serve so it would not go to waste.  Way to many options around to ever waste money here again.  Very VERY disappointing!

I am left thinking that the people who left 5 star reviews for this place are either financially vested in this place or offered some MAJOR discounts to write them."}
{"text":"I understand that sometimes restaurants have bad or off days.  They are run by people, and from time to time it happens.  Tonight however was a disaster!  

First off if you have a young child like my family does, you may have to have them sit in your lap.  As you see, they have only three highchairs!  The staff also seemed to initially care less, as the lady who sat us instantly went back to stand at her station and never even mentioned they had no chairs, or that it might be a while.

The food was also not even up to par to earn a three yelp star.  I tried a little bit of a wide verity, and found a common theme.  Nothing was hot, and at best warm.  If you are a fan of certain Chineese buffett staples, you may be disappointed.  General Tsao chicken for example can not be found here.  Lastly the ice cream tasted as if it were left over from the old Furrs days.

I wished this place invested in the resources to have a chance, but I just can't see them lasting past summer.  If the health inspector don't shut them down, the low quality food certainly will!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst buffets I have ever been to. The sushi was awful, dumplings were over fried,  the variety of sushi was limited down to 4 choices, the advertising outside the restaurant displayed rainbow sushi once inside the restaurant ,that sushi was nowhere to be found, the egg drop soup had no flavor and was over priced. Also another thing since when is preach cobbler Chinese?"}
{"text":"This place  is the finest Chinese buffet my husband and I have ever had. They have a full sushi bar, king crab, all the to die for regular eats and the best ice cream and dessert bars. Don't know why there are a few 1 stars for this place. It's new, clean, great customer service and fresh food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible! This is my second time trying this place out! The First time I came the food must have been sitting down for the longest time ever . The wings and chow mien where crusty! The fish had no flavor and the chicken smelled funny. . . Should've took the fact the parking lot was empty for a reason!"}
{"text":"The food was very bland. The only good thing was the sushi...the service was horrible, waiter was not friendly at all, the other female waiters were on the other side at another booth table chopping vegetables up. Yes vegetables. With their bare hands. You are eating this food ppl. When i didnt tip because i can choose not to it is my right the waiter looked at the recipt as she was at our table and looked right back at us. It was one of the rudest things i have ever seen. All u did was bring us drinks. My first time here and will never go back. As we were leaving she said something in chinese and lets just say it was not positive. You have just lost a future customer
 Ruined my time there. If u want to be harassed by angry chinese women this is the place to go if u dont or cant tip unpleasant workers."}
