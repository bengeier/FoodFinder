{"text":"A great chef and compassionate person. Always  delicious and always vegan. The meals are tasty and we'll seasoned. I enjoy the soups and chili, especially when the weather gets cold."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but I love food variety and healthy meal. At \"Vegan Meal by Mindy\" they found a way to make it very enjoyable to look and delicious to eat. I usually have 3 to 4 vegan meals per week and it can't be compared to any take home food. Just need to warm up and to eat, It is very convenient and you can even ask for delivery at home. Nice way to add diversity in you plate!!"}

{"text":"I've been ordering from Mindy for over a year now and have never been disappointed! I love her meals and the convenience is amazing. I've even saved hundreds of dollars now that I have no need to do any major grocery shopping. I do not like to cook and if I was in charge of my nutrition I would be eating bread and just mayo every day. She makes sure I get what I need to be the healthiest vegan possible. Thank you Mindy!!! You've changed my life for the better."}
{"text":"A vegan Bobby? Yes! She has one, it tasted great AND it's vegan! We have been ordering from Mindy for about 6 months so far. I'm not vegan, however, I like to incorporate vegetarian and vegan meals into my diet. I don't know how Mindy comes up with the flavor combos. Every Monday when it gets delivered, we get excited! On top of the food being so flavorful, the desserts are just as delicious. She makes a delicious monkey bread and the coconut cake is dreamy!"}
{"text":"I tried Vegan Meals by Mindy for the first time this week.  Mindy makes it super easy and convenient to place an order.  All you have to do is view the weekly menu she posts on her site each Wednesday, text in your order by noon Saturday, and pick it up on Sunday.   You can also opt for a Monday delivery at an additional charge.  Mindy is very friendly and the food is delicious and fresh (she shops on Saturdays and cooks Sundays).  Of the five tasty meals I've tried so far, my favorite is the eggplant ciabatta with strawberry salad and candied pecans.   I'll definitely use her service again!"}
{"text":"I ordered Vegan Meals by Mindy for the first time today since my husband is out of town and I don't want to starve. I like the idea of Vegan food being available at home and she makes it very easy to order, and will answer any questions you may have. I picked up my order today, 1 weeks worth of dinners. It was very reasonably priced and the variety is amazing. I wanted to eat them all at once but decided to pace myself. I chose the Eggplant BLT, which came with Lemon Dill Potato Salad. OMG!!!! IF I could give this 10 stars I would. It tasted so much like a BLT, and had all the flavors I loved. The potato salad, WOW! It tasted so much better than most I have tried. To know it is vegan and healthy is an added plus. I definitely recommend Mindy's service to vegans and non-vegans alike. Give it a chance, you will be amazed."}
{"text":"Mindy & Staff are the Best!!  Thank y'All.   The menu availability changes weekly--check.  Excellent dinner, Mindy...I didn't wait until gametime     Â¡Yum!"}
{"text":"Vegan meals by Mindy is seriously the best! You don't necessarily even have to be a vegan to enjoy them. Everything is so fresh and delicious, you can't even tell the difference. It all tastes just as good if not better than a meal that includes meat and dairy. For instance the mac n' cheese this week is phenomenal. Best I've ever had. And the mushroom & Swiss burger, to die for. Am so hooked, I want to try everything! Even the crab cakes with jasmine Rice was awesome & haven't ever been a fan of seafood. This is so much better. Don't even get me started on the desserts which have all been absolutely AMAZING & INCREDIBLE!!! Thanks so much Mindy, keep up the great work!! Looking forward to what's on the menu later this week already. :)"}
{"text":"Mindy's vegan meals has changed my life! Having delicious food delivered weekly to my door is the best thing! Everything I have ordered is wonderful. I have never had a bad meal. The food is full of flavor and is always fresh! If your wondering if this is something you want to try, do it, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered meal preps for years now but I've only been a vegan for 2 months. We found a meal prep company that cost a lot of money and we wasted the food every week because it was just Blah! I had been chatting with Mindy for months before becoming a vegan so we gave her a shot. Long story short, she is extremely responsive, the portions are huge (double than our previous meal prep), every piece of food is consumed, affordable and the food is insanely good!!!! My son also said that he finally found a brownie that tasted better than mine! Lol! Great work Mindy!"}
{"text":"Clever recipes, ingeniously prepared, bursting with flavor.  Mindy shows true dedication to her craft.  There isn't a better place to get vegan cuisine in Las Vegas.  Order now."}
{"text":"Where else can you go and talk directly to the chef? She texts each and every customer. What GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Ok the food....Amazing flavors. I've had delivery one time and I couldn't believe there was NO DAIRY in her food. Rich and creamy textures and bold yummy flavor. (If my husband didn't just lose his job is order again) Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is, I would like to see things packaged a little differently.   Example: if the item has bread, saran wrap it separately or zip lock it on the side. so it's not soggy & if the entree is \"juicy \" place a piece of foil kinda in between so the goodness don't run into the salad. Can't wait to text I'M IN THIS WEEK again to her so I can tear that food up!"}
{"text":"Amazing meals by Vegan Meals by Mindy!!  1. Sweet potato black bean enchiladas with an avocado cilantro cream sauce (GF)  2. Thai peanut veggie collard greens wrap with ginger garlic noodle soup with bok choy  3. Grilled 2 cheese caramelized onion sandwich with cream tomato soup (GF available)   This was my 1st time ordering her meals and all 3 were FANTASTIC!! The flavor was so mouthwatering and amazing. When I would finish a meal, I would comment how great it was and when I finished my last one, I messaged her complementing her meals. I found myself already looking at her new menu as she rotates it every week. She posts the new items a very Wednesday, order by Saturday and pick them up on Sunday in Summerlin.   Also she has great customer service! Go check out her  website and social media accounts. She'll post her new menu items with pics"}
{"text":"Found out about her by driving she was passing by me and had her name and logo on her car. Recently became a vegan and sometimes its really hard to think of what to cook. So decided to try it out. I ordered 5 meals, Just had my 1st and am very impressed of quality and quantity. Taste really good and has plenty to fill you up. So far I give her a 10. Cant wait to see what is next on the menu."}
