{"text":"I just got my pizza. Supreme. The pizza dough is way undercooked. Dough is still white, not golden. They refused to assist me by saying there was no manager in to issue a refund. I told them they can come pick up their raw pizza. I will never order from here again,  due to their customer service."}
{"text":"My family has now ordered from here about 6 times and each time the food is delicious, hot, and our orders always correct. Piece Out delivers pizza like pizza is supposed to be - not frozen dough or mass produced. I've ordered the calzone which is HUGE.  We are very excited we have a new \"favorite\" delivery pizza place."}
{"text":"I won't waste your time with a bunch of preamble. I'll just say it. This is the best pizza in Mesa. It's tucked away, but worth seeking out. Not only is it absolutely delicious, but it's very affordable compared to other pizza restaurants in the area. I can't recommend it enough. High quality pizza."}
{"text":"This could have easily been five stars if the the service was better.   At first I was going to leave a 1 star because when I came in there was only 3 of us in the restaurant, the cashier, the owner folding boxes and me. The Cashier took my order and then answered a call  to help a customer with a phone order. The owner with full view of me, knowing I just ordered and just kept folding boxes to ad to the hundreds of boxes already folded. Why did the owner not respect my time as I was in a hurry on lunch break. I was about to leave and the owner took 25 sec to get my order in the oven  I know he probably has the cashier make the order and was hoping phone call would be short so the cashier would make my order and he wouldn't hace to be bothered. You can't can't expect customers  to come back if their time is worth LESS THAN A BOX! Any owner or worker who respected their customers would have put the boxes down for 25 seconds and put my order in the oven, then continued with the boxes. He is lacking a professional image, time management skills & work ethic.   The pizza was good, but there are a lot of places that have good pizza and prompt courteous service. I hope they correct the customer service, I would eat there again with prompt courteous service."}
{"text":"I love coming to here because I live so close but the staff neglects the customer and have loud conversations amongst themselves. Also very overpriced, there are better options for less."}
{"text":"These guys just added cheese steaks to the menu and I will only say this once: you are missing out on some of the best cheese steaks in the valley if you don't try them. Seriously."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local pizza place. The pizza is always quite good the day of. Use an oven for the leftovers because despite the edge of the crust being quite thick, the crust under the toppings is surprisingly thin and a microwave decimates it.   Garlic knots go a bit overboard on the herbs, so be prepared if you're not a BIG oregano fan."}
{"text":"First time pizza and wing delivery last night. Arrived well within the time frame I was told when ordering. Wings were crispy without being overcooked. The pizza was very good! There is a wonderful hint of what I think is roasted garlic in the sauce. It was amazing. Sometimes garlic can be overpowering but no so with this pizza. Great experience....we will become repeat customers!"}
{"text":"I randomly walked into this place one day, and tried their big ass pizza slice, that's what they literally call it, and it lives up to its name, and on top of it it's very very good, I come from New York, and this lives up to it being in Arizona, must check out place."}
{"text":"Ordered last night. 90 perfect of the pizza was stuck to the cardboard because they forgot to put the little white thing inside, and probably set the drink on top. We also ordered boneless wings that were mostly gristle and made us all sick for about an hour. We called, the lady was nice and said \"we'll send another one out right away\". Waited an hour, then decided to leave. They never called or apologized. Same too, I really liked their pizza the first time I had it."}
{"text":"The sign on the marquis shows one name. The sign above the door shows another. The sign on the door shows a third. Their pizza may be good but their promotional skills suck!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Their \"Big Ass Slices\" hold up to their name!! Super friendly staff! All of the deliveries have been fast and correct. The shop is very clean as well! Love going to this place and always recommend it to friends and family! Great wings prices too!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight. 14\" pepperoni and sausage, and boneless wings.  Food arrived quickly and hot. The driver was wearing a uniform from a different pizza place - Pizza on 87. I asked about it and he said it was the same owner.   The pizza was hot, but it was one of the greasiest pizzas I've seen. After blotting it with paper towels, I pulled a slice... all of the toppings slid right off the floppy dough. It was way undercooked... raw basically. I turned on the oven and scooped the ingredients back on that slice and ate it anyway because I was starving. I popped the rest of the pie in the oven at 350 for like 15 minutes. That just made it angry.   It wasn't burned at all, but it was sort of hard at this point - I think the grease seeped into the raw layer of the dough and made it practically impossible to cook properly. After a slice and a half of their smallest pie, I had gut rot almost immediately. I'm not looking forward to an hour or so from now when my body will reject this.  The crust was done in a bit of a twisty design which just made a 14\" pizza more like a 10 or a 12 surrounded by a loaf of bread. It tasted okay, but also sort of like Pillsbury pizza dough in a can. The other toppings were flavorful as well, but also didn't taste \"premium\" or like any of it was made in-house.  The boneless wings (aka chicken nuggets) were tasty - tender white meat. But I wouldn't be surprised if they came from a factory frozen or if the BBQ sauce came from a jar you could find at a grocery store.   I won't be eating the leftovers - unfortunately, they'll have to go straight into the trash. And I don't like to pick on a place like this, but in my experience for the most part... when a place has a terrible logo/concept that looks like real effort was put into it, their food is typically mediocre at best. There are exceptions. Not everyone who starts a great restaurant is also an excellent marketer or graphic designer. Some people are amazing chefs and yet they will put their entire menu in Comic Sans.   I especially don't like writing bad reviews for local restaurants. But as I sit here with my insides twisting, I find myself compelled. And no, I did not contact them (or grubhub) to give them a chance to make me happy - I assume they probably would. *shrug*"}
