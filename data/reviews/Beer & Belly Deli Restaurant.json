{"text":"Good food. Rude service. The burger does not outweigh the blatant disrespect for customers. Owner was rude on two different occasions to two different people in my group."}
{"text":"I ordered the strip steak special. I want you to know that this was AMAZING! If you haven't come here in awhile, GET BACK IN HERE. I promise you won't disappointed!!!FYI the steak special is every Friday night."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place. Now it's nothing but bad Karaoke and cheap beer.    They used to have some of the best Cocktails in town, now its just cheap beer and cheap food.    So if you like country music, cheap beer, and crappy food, along with a crowd that hasnt updated their wardrobes or hairstyles since the 80's, then this just might be your place."}
{"text":"nice little local watering hole. my cousins have apparently been going here for years and I finally got to drink here last week. on tap were Bud, Bud Light, something else (I think Coors?) and Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.  there's outdoor seating in the front by the parking lot. karaoke on most Saturdays, though the lady who runs it wasn't there when we went. was looking forward to it :(  there's one of those digital jukeboxes. of course this meant I subjected everyone to a block of Dio, Bon Jovi, Metallica, and Poison...and after a few drinks did my thing and sang along anyway.  I'm a party machine."}
{"text":"Great burgers!! Everyone in our party raved about their dinners and the prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best bar owner ever! The pizza is fantastic. If I lived closer to this bar, i'd hang out here a lot. Awesome draft beer prices!"}
