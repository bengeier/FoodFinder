{"text":"The food is really good. The beef is super tender and very well cooked. The Mac salad is awesome and so is the dole whip. But what really sells this place is the customer service. Jake in particular went above and beyond the scope of his job to see a happy customer. They gave us pork instead of beef and Jake took care of us like real customer service should. And on his way out the door after his shift, with keys in his hand he asked my wife and I if we needed anything else. That meant a lot considering most people now a days rush out of work and once they  are off the clock. Thank you Jake and mokis. We will
Be back."}
{"text":"Used to be good but has gone way down hill. Prices have been increased and portions reduced. They just had a Groupon and totally changed everything it said online for their benefit. RIPOFF!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I've tried all the meat plates and they are all excellent, but my favorite is the Katsu Chicken. I've had Katsu sauce at several other places and it is never as good as at Moki's. The teriyaki beef along with some brown rice is also wonderful. Every meal comes with a slice of fresh pineapple.

The dining room is small, but they just finished a remodel and it looks very nice. It is clean and they are very fast with the food. They also do takeout and I've never had them get an order wrong."}
{"text":"After returning from Hawaii, my husband is seeking out Loco Moco, which Mokis has on the menu.  However, this version was not exactly like Slappy Cakes on Maui, which, according to hubby, is to die for!  What he was most disappointed with was that the eggs were WAY over cooked.  He was hoping for the runny yokes. I ordered the combo plate and the pork and chicken were VERY good!  We may go back for that and for Mokisadas!. :)"}
{"text":"Not the best Hawaiian food I have had.  The chicken katsu was crunchy but it was the weirdest katsu sauce I have ever had. The white rice was completely tasteless and the macaroni salad was very blah as well. My husband wasn't thrilled with his beef either.  We haven't gone back and I don't think we will."}
{"text":"My mother was born and raised in Hawaii and I've lived there myself. This is pretty authentic Hawaiian lunch plate food. Everything is spot on (except the malasadas but I'll get back to that).

I had the two meat plate with teriyaki chicken and kalua pork. Both were great. The macaroni salad is definitely Hawaiian style. My daughter got the Hawaiian salad as her side and I tried it - I loved it! It's light and refreshing with a kicky vinaigrette. 

They have a few dessert options. The Dole Pineapple soft serve is delicious. I was so excited to see malasadas on the menu, but was disappointed that they weren't the real deal. They are essentially fried biscuit dough coated in too much sugar - awful. Not even close to what you get at Leonard's or Champion Bakery in Hawaii. I'd give Moki's 5 stars if it weren't for that."}
{"text":"I love their food. Prices are reasonable, they have always been friendly.   There food is cooked to order and delicious with simple Hawaiian fare. No matter what you're in the mood for, this is sure the please."}
{"text":"Food was good. My only complaint was that it took over 20 minutes to get our food. We ordered to go and a few younger workers seemed to be more interested in talking and hanging out rather than getting our food together. This was a bit inconvenient as we had others waiting on us to bring back food. Food was enjoyable though."}
{"text":"Tiny portions and severely fatty chicken dishes overshadowed the quick service and yummy shakes. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I gave 3 stars due to price. It's a bit over priced for the food and portion size. One visit I did the bowl which includes rice an chicken etc. The scoop of rice was too small and not that much meat. They need to lower their prices a couple dollars or give more food. If you don't mind over paying a small amount, then go. The food is good."}
{"text":"Really a treat. Fresh, tasty food and plenty of it. Great menu choices with authentic flavors. Nice, casual atmosphere. We'll be back! Aloha!"}
{"text":"Food was good....the service was excellent.  The Sticky Chicken had great flavor and the Hawaiian salad was superb."}
{"text":"First off I love a friendly inviting restaurant, but I prefer a clean even more. There was a table that was occupied when we came in, empty when we ordered, and remained dirty all while we dined. There is a person who brings out your food...here an idea BRING OUT A TOWEL. I will say I found this place on groupon, and so I treated the kids out for a meal, after we ordered the cashier ,and sure to say \"Groupon Order\". Now what does that mean.....we were soon to find out. Well after receiving a few plates that slightly resembled the pictures on the wall we decided to look at our neighbors plates and they got more food.....hold on before you say they ordered the double plate, because I DID, so \"Groupon Order\" means a deal, but my friend you get a sample plate. The sad part is it was not that great, my trip to the islands had waaay better food, this was like getting Hawaiian food from a sub par food truck. I will say my kids liked the cake and ice cream, it is a delightful refresher after you avoided 60% of your groupon meal. A piece of cake and ice cream sweetened with a little bit of sugar, and a kiss of diabetes, but when you have teenagers they will eat a sugar cube if you let them. Well pretty decent chicken with a teriyaki sauce that is thinner than Soy sauce, and served in the one communal bottle located at the counter. If I am going to devour a meal of meat/carbs, it better be a good meal, but my guess is they contacted my doctor and decided to serve us the \"Groupon Meal\" for my health. Save yourself the trip, and a few bucks and go to that Ono Hawaiian place, its corporate, but consistent, and even a few dollars cheaper. Fun fact wildcats, we went there right after this disaster of a groupon meal."}
{"text":"Moki's is a personal favorite of mine. The food is always pretty good. My wife and I usually get the teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu combo plate with rice and spinach salad. The salad is great and the rest is always pretty good. This place is low key and relaxed. Plus, it's full of superstars. Went there one time and i saw Deuce Lutui and Anquan Boldin."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here. The staff was friendly and the food was really good. I had the two meat plate (chicken katsu and pork) with Hawaiian salad and brown rice."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a great place to grab a quick casual meal. The food is always fresh and tastes clean. I leave feeling satisfied but not guilty. The staff could use some help. They don't do well when it's busy but for the most part everyone is still friendly."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not authentic.  Too few staff to accommodate customers. Stick to L&L or Ono's if you're looking for a Hawaiian-kine fix."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and we absolutely love it. There's always a sense of genuine hospitality. The food is second to no other Hawaiian restaurant in town we will definitely be returning as often as we can and would highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and can give the place my definite recommendation. 
The first time I went I did not even know that it existed when I noticed the sign in 
front of the eatery from the parking lot. I was hungry so decided to try it out and boy was I impressed overall! I have eaten the No. 7 everyday special which is 2 eggs, a burger patty with brown gravy, side salad and choice of white or brown rice. This happens to be a traditional Hawaiian-Polynesian dish and it was delicious! I like this meal with soy sauce and there is a bottle on each table. No alcohol though the usual carbonated soft drinks though I suggest you try one of the canned Hawaiian drinks which are imported from the islands and these are very refreshing. They also serve a variety of desserts which are all island style and the customer restrooms are kept very clean which is always impressive to me. The staff is helpful and friendly and once a month on the third Friday of the month they offer live Polynesian dancers along with an all you can eat buffet for $10.00 which is definitely a real deal for diners! Drinks are not included though the price to eat all you want is worthwhile. I saw one of the Friday night performances and I was impressed with one hula dancer showing off the various native dances of the south pacific tribes along with Josh who is a native Maori who also showed off his native dance steps as well. Oh and you really need to try the chicken katsu with  the special sauce which was so delicious! Basically a boneless and deep fried chicken dish which was not greasy at all with a side of their dipping sauce which made the meal worthwhile. You can get this item as one of the daily specials. Overall I really love Moki's Hawaiian Grill and give it my highest overall recommendation!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the March luau night and really enjoyed the experience. Friendly staff, good entertainment, and ono (delicious) all you can eat food for only $10. Not a bad deal especially when you missing the taste of home. 

One thing that caught me off guard though was the katsu sauce. Not the usual tangy, dark brown sauce I'm used to. It was homemade and on the sweeter side with an orangy color. Different, but still good."}
{"text":"Great food and very nice staff! We had the kahlua pork and teriyaki chicken both were extemely good. The rice here is very Tasty aswell my only complaint was the macaroni salad was a bit dry and didn't taste that good. I might have just had it on a off day as ive heard from others that it's normally awesome."}
{"text":"Well crafted meals with attention to detail! I'm not too familiar with real authentic hawaiin style food consumed on one of the lovely islands of Hawaii, but I do know for the desert valley, this is AMAZING. Fair prices for freshly cooked fruity themed food, I must say this place is great! (Pineapple slice included w/ plate, nice touch)"}
{"text":"I was craving kalua pig the other day so convinced A, to haul ass all the way to Mesa for Hawaiian food. I knew he'd be up for it because he'd never had it before. He ordered the combo plate which came with 2 scoops of rice, teriyaki chicken, grilled mahi mahi, and fried shrimp. 

I got the combo plate with teriyaki beef and kalua pork. Yum yum. We washed down our meals with cold passion fruit juice. 

A little disappointed that they didn't have island short ribs on the menu."}
{"text":"I used to come here a few times a month with my boyfriend. Man oh man did we fall in love! 

 Here are some pros from when we first started coming:

1. My salmon plate was cooked to order
2. The chicken/pork were always flavorful and tender
3. The spinach salad is amazing, I could eat it alllllll day!
4. Grandmas chocolate cake is so !*$&ing good, so rich.
5. They offer brown rice.
6. It felt like we were guests in a home.

Cons now:
1. They've hired some new people who are nice, but it doesn't feel like it used to.
2. My salmon was raw once.
3. The other food isn't as good as it used to be, I can put my finger on what it is, overlooked maybe?
4. Slightly pricey For The amount of food

The cons are the reason for the 4-star instead of 5. Spinach salad is still amazing. Will come back once in a while, but not as often."}
{"text":"Good food if your missing some home cooked island food. Lau Lau's are awesome and so is the Kahluha pig (sorry brah, I still like my Aunties better).  Nice atmosphere and kitschy.  Reminds of a couple of the shrimp shacks on North Shore."}
{"text":"Love this place Mokis is great food nice atmosphere and friendly people working here . I miss the aloha and Malo . Always a great time and I miss the decor . Please tell me your staying for a while and not leaving please enjoy going anywhere with my dad he draws cool pictures"}
{"text":"My Hawaiian craving hit and I needed some loco moco - STAT.  Aloha Kitchen is closed on Mondays (so I haven't had a chance to try it) so after some Yelping and help from Groupon, we stumbled upon Moki.  According to the cashier, it's been around for about 10 yrs so I'm sorry I haven't checked it out sooner!  

Staff is good - I like their \"roll with it\" vibe. I can understand that some people might want more touchy feely, but I'm in it for the eats. They are pleasant enough provide very fast service. 

I would say almost too fast service. The Groupon covered two combo entrees (one meat) and two desserts. My husband and I both ordered the loco moco (my craving spread) and we went with mokisada (me) and grandma's cake (him). 

It was pretty slow at 2pm on a Monday so our orders came out within 10 mins. We had just settled down to eat when suddenly my mokisada came out as well. That was a surprise - I thought they would check on our food status and then bring it out when we were about half done. Nope!  Not too long after the mokisada came out the chocolate cake did too. Now, we did not overlook this opportunity to try both of our desserts - they were just chilling there after all - and they were very delicious.  I just wish they had come out a little later so we didn't have to watch it melt while we ate. 

However, I do understand - this is more cafe-style than restaurant. There aren't waiters but they are nice enough to bring your food to you. There are utensils on each table - you have to grab them yourself. I would just prepare to either eat your main meal first and then go order your dessert or ask them if they would kindly wait on making dessert until you let them know (more for the Groupon people). 

Now, on to the food again!  The loco mocos were pretty good for us - nothing fancy, basic hamburger patty with brown gravy and an over easy/med/hard egg on white rice.  I think they offer brown rice as an alternative too but we didn't get the offer. No worries - if I'm already going for loco moco, what is brown rice really going to do for me?  I take my liberties and threw on some siracha for some kick and I was good to go. You have a few choices for sides with your plate which is nice - I don't care for macaroni salad all the time. There are 3 veggie salads to choose from outside of the normal macaroni salad - spinach, fresh, and hawaiian. Each salad has its own set of ingredients and dressing. I chose the hawaiian and my husband got the spinach. Both were pretty good in my opinion. My husband really liked the dressing on his spinach salad. If I had to say anything I would say the hawaiian salad needed a touch more dressing if anything.  I felt the price for the combo was reasonable considering we are able to customize it a little and the portion size was more than enough - we couldn't finish all the rice. My parents would've been ashamed with me had they known. 

The desserts were epic and completely unexpected in size. The other drawback to staring at your dessert while you eat is also knowing exactly how much room you have to leave yourself for dessert. As tempting as it was to just eat the rest of the rice, I just couldn't. Mokisadas come in several forms and names but it's basically a fried doughnut rolled in sugar. It was one of my favorite things as a child and exciting to have again... But not in the form of FIVE (slightly smaller) tennis balled sized delights ringing a bowl with two large scoops if ice cream (they have several flavors to choose from) and a large handful of strawberries. With everything drizzled in pineapple sauce. Don't get me wrong - it was delicious!  A bite of warm doughnut with ice cream and a strawberry is like a fattier version of strawberry short cake. For one person after an already large entree?  Near impossible to finish unless I planned on literally rolling myself out the door.  I was able to get 2.5 Mokidown and about one scoop of ice cream but then I had to call it quits. 

It wasn't quite Hawaii all over again (since I could see the paint drip off my car from the heat instead of seeing the ocean spray), but it was a nice reminder. Will be back for my loco moco fix!"}
{"text":"It was good, the Kalua pork had little to no cabbage, I'm from the islands and used to a lot of cabbage. The portions are small too for the price. The girl was friendly very cheerful. The boys behind cooking (they looked like teenagers) seemed very busy. Ono's is far from me so other than that it's pretty good going to try the poke next.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can't get much more authentic than this... Everyone I bring there love it. A bit pricey with healthy servings. Their Hawaiian salad is unique and the teriyaki chicken never disappoints. I recommend Mokis Hawaiian Grill for sure..."}
{"text":"Constantly trying Hawaiian places in the valley but the options and Katsu here is simply the best I've had. Sad they aren't more centrally located. Also, the atmosphere is great with contemporary island music playing, sit down take your time and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"We had a groupon to use so invited friend's to join us for an adventure as we had never been here before.  Up entering we were taken aback by the \"fast food\" environment as we had expected a sit down resaurant.  We should've left but having read reviews about the food being very good, went ahead with our order.  We purchased a groupon for two dinners and desert.  We were informed that the 2 deserts for $5.95 each was no longer offered and two small drinks for $1.69 ea were substituted.  Again, we should have left but food quality reviews encouraged us to order.  Our friends ordered the Grilled fish which they found to salty to eat.  It was decided it was the marinade as no salt was added.  They did prepare another order with no marinade which allow them to eat it.  My teriyaki beef was striking with lots of fat but the spinach salad was wonderful.  The \"Sticky\" chicken was described as good.  I decided to try the Grandma's chocolate cake.  It was good but way over priced.  I will not go back and encourage others to think carefully about eating here."}
{"text":"My kids and I love Moki's, especially this location. We have been loyal patrons of this place since we first moved to AZ.  Order, pay at the register, then find a table, where food is later served to you - that is how it works here. So, I probably would suggest you stand away from the register to get a feel for the menu, which is on the wall above the register, rather than walk up to order and not know what to get. 
My kids usually get the combo teriyaki beef with rice and macaroni salad, and I always order the combo mahi mahi with brown rice and macaroni salad. We are big rice eaters and they seem to make their rice better than most. While many love the Kahlua pork, I think their beef teriyaki is just as good. They're chicken katsu is divine, too! Prices range from $8.95 and up, which used to be less, but increased when the price of food, goods, supplies, etc. rose - justified. 

For dessert, yes, Moki's has desserts! I love their \"grandma's cake\" - I can't remember the real name for this, but it's a rich chocolate cake with something that tastes like heath bar as its topping and served with a side of coconut ice-cream...Yum! My kids usually get ice-cream (mostly free as a kind gesture from the owner, who also happens to be a good friend). They carry tropical flavored ice-cream if you're up to trying something different. Overall, Moki's is great and worth the drive if you don't live nearby or make it a point to eat here if you happen to be in the area. They are located within a shopping plaza next to Safeway on the corner of Southern and Val Vista.  

**Oh, and on your way out from Moki's, don't forget to hit the To'ere drum with the stick, next to the door - you'll get a huge \"Mahalo\" straight from the kitchen and staff!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Hawaii for over 5 years, I constantly have a craving for Hawaiian food. Moki's reminds me of little local restaurants in Hawaii. When I walk in I feel like I'm back in the islands. The atmosphere is very local style and the people are totally laid back. The decor has a do-it-yourself feel that IS local kine. 

I've tried every Hawaiian restaurant in the Valley and this is by far my favorite. I go back often and highly recommend Moki's to anyone looking for some great Hawaiian eats!"}
{"text":"Went into the Mesa location at Saturday 10/25/14 around 8:45pm, I was really looking forward to dinner here since I haven't ate there in months. When I arrived I didn't get a welcoming feel by the staff, which the cooks were in the lobby area watching TV and the counter girl looked as if I was a bother to her. When I went to the counter she was at the register just waiting for me to speak, I proceeded to order my two plates and for one I wanted the Katsu and in a rude manner was told since it was 45 minutes to closing there was none left. Which I could understand since it was closer to closing. So I was ordered the Teriyaki Chicken for both of my plates, while I was getting my sauces on the side was informed by the girl who was making the plates that they ran out of the Teriyaki as well.  She offered me the Kalua Pork instead. At that point I was bothered with the fact that the cooks were still just sitting in the lobby and went outside to see if my significant other was okay with having pork since they were now out of all the chicken.  At that point I decided that it wasn't worth the money and requested a refund of the food. Both the counter girl and server girl were trying to figure out how to do the refund back to the debit card that was used. At this point I will no longer being returning to Moki's because of how poor of service I received and how unprofessional the employees were towards customers."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service. I love the salad so much that I ordered it for a family dinner. The webpage says $28 for up to 15 people. They charged me $42. When I asked about the difference the woman called her boss who said no that it was $36 and the rest was for taxes. 22% tax on a salad?  Feel like I was just robbed.

To top it off, told the one pan of salad I got is actually for a party of 7 from a restaurant manager."}
{"text":"Beats the heck out of Ono's. Katsu chicken is the best. Teriyaki Beef is also lean an good unlike other Hawaiian BBQ places I've been to in the valley. The Hawaiian Salad is also awesome. You can't go wrong here especially if you try Grandma's Chocolate Cake. A must have!"}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone from the menu posted on their website. Spam musubi is for $3.00 on the website. There it does not say anything about extra charge for the sauce or any of that stuff. Well I asked for extra katsu sauce and ordered 4 Musubi's and chicken katsu. I was charged $15.00 for the 4 Musubi and .50c for the extra sauce.(that didn't even come in my bag)
When I called to ask about the price I was charged they said oh the website is really old... and we don't change it all the time. I think they are misrepresenting their business and are over priced for not so good food. I am afraid they are losing my business."}
{"text":"We Love the food, but the service leaves something to be desired. We've never heard a greeting, or a thank you any of the times we've gone in. A little on the pricey side too."}
{"text":"Worst place EVER! The group-on coupon was deceiving and totally not worth the money spent! The food was less than below average, the atmosphere not AT all marketed as on the website and the personnel struggled to be convincing that they enjoyed being there. I've purchased many coupons, but never have had such a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"I discovered Mokis about 3 years ago when I first moved in to the area around it.  My roommate and I have a bad habit of always ordering a majority of the menu when we first try a new restaurant.  I had gone in about 30 minutes before they closed for the day and ordered like 12 of their dishes (can't remember which ones right now) and they didn't complain in the least that it would mean they would be open longer than they should be.  They constantly asked if I was ok or needed anything to drink.  All the food was cooked to perfection and I loved every dish.  They even gave us a couple extra items because they were going to have to throw them away anyways.  I would definitely recommend eating at this restaurant if you are looking for something out of the ordinary for Arizona cuisine."}
{"text":"Love their food! The luau they offer monthly is a lot of fun and a great deal! My biggest complaints are too many onions in the salad and they don't seem to restock the buffet at the luau. It seems like you never get curry chicken unless you're one of the first to arrive! The dessert it comes with is soooooo good and the chicken is flavorful and tender so it's my favorite Hawaiian restaurant!"}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon, it was all-inclusive for the two of us. I had the #1, teriyaki chicken, my wife had the #3, sticky chicken. It came out fast, it was all very good, and we would like to come back for sure. Also it should be noted that the people are super nice and the atmosphere is casual."}
{"text":"Hubs and I have been going here for years.  We love it.  The food is totally yummy.  It's a bit different than the other Hawaiian food restaurants I've been to.  I don't normally enjoy Hawaiian at places like Aloha Kitchen.  Moki's is more flavorful and less... mysterious.  I like being able to tell what it is I'm putting in my mouth.  

The atmosphere is kitschy-cool and I love the surfboard that acts as lighting.  Yeah, you read that right.  Also, the drum by the door to let them know the food was good is clever and fun and definitely adds to the Pacific-Island feel. 

I have used them for corporate catering purposes in the past to great satisfaction.  All parties who ate the catering raved and asked where they could go to get more.  Everyone is great to work with and the prices are great too."}
{"text":"We chose Mokis for a party of 50 last Saturday.  We selected the Pulled Pork, Brown Rice, and Macaroni Salad.  Not only was the food ready on time, it was phenomenal!!  Everyone complimented it and there was no pulled pork left by the end of the night!  We have eaten there often and every time the food was tasty and the service was always with a happy smile!

  Bonus:  I also highly recommend the teriyaki chicken!!   Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Food here is great.  Felt like we were back in Hawaii.  We had the Poke and it was very fresh Ahi and the Kalbi ribs are very flavorful and moist with just enough grill char.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love it!
Great place when you're in the mood for something different.
It just has a different taste that you don't find everywhere else. I walk out after any different type of meal there and feel like I had a Lite meal, even though I had the beef plate.
Recommend the Hawaiian salad. Love the pineapple and strawberry garnish at the end.

Great atmosphere. 
Mahalo!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq pork sandwich and macaroni salad. The customer service is always great too!"}
{"text":"First time here, found rhis little jem of a resturant in Mesa AZ.  Every first Friday of the month $12 all you can eat between 6-8pm.  Family run owned and ran.  I would suggest this place for good food and fun.  They cater to.. 

Wish we had one in Reno Nevada."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is delicious. Had the 2 meat combo. Katsu Chicken and Teriyaki Beef. So Ono!  Now trying an order of Malasadas!!  Yummy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal. We had the one item combos. One with sticky chicken and the other with Kalua pork. Both full of flavor and although it takes a while to prepare grab an appetizer because waiting is well worth it. The rice is not dry. Full of flavor. The pork and chicken were seasoned well. My fav is the Mac salad. Just like in Maui. Small business that caters to it's customers. They also do catering."}
{"text":"First time going and We loved the teriyaki chicken! The teriyaki beef was super soft!! My family and I will be going back! Also the dole whip was delicious!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now.  The first time was with a Groupon that included dessert - yummy!  Food is very tasty.  Service is good.  Very friendly staff.  It does get really busy at times though, which is a good sign for business."}
{"text":"No Ka Oi (#1!) plate lunch in the desert!  Lived on fresh, inexpensive plate lunch when I lived on Oahu and the Big Island, and Moki's fits the bill.  I had the Ahi Plate lunch with white rice, and a spinach salad side.  The salad was non-traditional, but oh so good!  The fish rocked, and the rice had a nice touch of salt and sugar.  Very good.  Wife had the Kahlua Pork Plate Lunch, and that was equally good.  We live near San Tan Village, but will make the trip to Moki's regularly due to the quality, quantity, and authenticity.  I told you when I was there, and I'll say it again:  YOU GUYS ROCK!!  Aloha."}
{"text":"This place used to be one our favorites, always good, always great service!  They must be under new management now because the food is barely subpar and tastes nothing like it did 9 months ago!  We will not be going back and are super sad our favorite Hawaiian food is gone !!"}
{"text":"have tried this place a couple times.Have young kids running the place and quality of food has gone way down. i got Kalbi and terri chicken both were cold and tasted like they had been cooked and sitting for awile. Kalbi did not have any of the bones tasted like scrap meat no flavor, cold and very dry. Chicken was cold and dry also. If I did not have take out and have went back to work I would of taken it back. Sad to say gave it two chances will never go back Hire a manager that will take some pride in their job clean house with those that dont care."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time so I haven't tried everything. I ordered the spam musubi, the teriyaki chicken plate with macaroni salad, and some sort of chocolate brownie dessert with coconut ice cream. The best thing was the dessert-that was really good. 2nd best was the musubi. I didn't care for the entrée. The chicken was ok, lacked teriyaki sauce and wasn't very juicy. The rice was bland and the macaroni salad was the worst out of everything I had. I am comparing it to Ono's BBQ, so this place was a bit disappointing. I wanted to try something different because I had a groupon for this place, but I probably will never be back. Ono's macaroni salad and quality of meat was better. Granted I only tried this place once, so other items may be much better, but to me, if your macaroni salad is not good, I don't consider it good Hawaiin BBQ."}
{"text":"Wow! I guess that I'm spoiled by L & L Hawaiian BBQ or maybe there was just no pride taken in my meal that I paid over $10.00 for. But I have never been so dissapointed ordering Hawaiian food ever. 
I ordered the 2 meat combo with 1 teryaki beef and 1 chicken katsu. As well as 1 spam musubi. Let's start off with the spam musubi. $3.00 for 1! The menu didn't say how many was to be included but coming from working and patronizing L & L Hawaiian BBQ I automatically assumed that it would be 2...especially for $3.00. But getting past the price the spam wasn't fried (which it usually is to bring out the flavor and slightly carmelize the meat) it was simply sliced and wrapped in what seemed to be regular white rice instead of jasmine or sticky rice.  Anytime Ive ever had spam musubi in the past the rice has always had a very distinct smell inducative of sticky/jasmine rice. When I picked the musubi up and took a bite all of the rice started to fall out. #Dissapointed. Moving on to the macaroni salad it was flavorless and the portion was extremely small. It was also watery, and not thick. Again something that I'm used to having when ordering macaroni salad from a Hawaiian cuisine establishment. The chicken katsu on it's own was good but its sauce was very \"Americanized\" in that it was yellow instead of brown. It tasted like it just had ketchup, mayo, mustard and pepper. It wasn't very good. And finally the beef was extremely dry. It tasted like warm beef jerky with teryaki sauce poured over it. The meat was very tough and not tender which it should've been. Being as though it was so dry it seems like the food preparer either missed the marinating part or didn't bother to marinate it for longer than 10 minutes or so.  If you're going to serve Hawaiian food then more pride should be taken in it's preparation., and presentation."}
{"text":"I had the sticky chicken. I thought it had a faint asian flair to it. I thought it was delicious! The meal I had came with white rice with black sesame seeds on top. I also chose the macaroni salad, which was ok - I thought it was a little light on the mayo. The meal also came with a sweet and ripe slice of pineapple.

We also got the chicken katsu which was crispy and tender.  It came with an orange dipping sauce that was the \"Thousand Island\" dressing, which was pretty tasty. The side salad was basically cole slaw with miniature crispy noodles - I felt that it was more texture than flavor."}
{"text":"Mokis is great! The katsu chicken is amazing. The sauce is great. It's a good place to grab some food and hangout for a while."}
{"text":"I have loved there food every time I've gone there. Until the last few times, there staff has been constantly changing. And the food had a look and taste as if it had been sitting out. And the food was cold which was a bummer because I took it to go. I walked in and no one was in there except for the employees. I like Mokis but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"Visiting town from Colorado, my friend and I love Hawaiian restaurants. Moki's was good. Nice menu selection. Got the chicken katsu and short ribs. Pretty good. Ribs were a little tough, and the katsu sauce was t great. A little pricey also."}
{"text":"I leave full, but unfulfilled, and again I am forced to ask fellow Yelpers : WTF? Are we eating at the same place? I just paid $10.50 for a plate of chicken nuggets.  They were the \"sticky chicken\" and the \"sweet & sour\"-- poor choices on my part, yes, but it sounded worth a try.  Yelpers gave favorable nods to both.  The \"sticky\" wasn't so much sticky, but salty.  It was really, really salty.  The sweet & sour was as advertised, but it's better (and cheaper) at most Chinese places.  Chicken nuggets, though.  You can bring your kids, they'll love'em (cheaper at McDonald's though).  Me, not so much.  My hubby's kahlua pork was excellent, I will say that.  If we come back, I'll get a big steaming pile of that! The flavor was delicious, the consistency was tender and juicy-- definitely the highlight of an otherwise disappointing meal.  Skip the masubi, though.  It was a massive amount of white rice wrapped around a tiny sliver of spam, contained in a seaweed wrap.  The seal it up in Saran wrap and microwave it to death.  Spam is cheap, it's readily available and musubi is meant to be a big slice griiled in teriyaki sauce and wrapped up like a sushi roll.  Fail on all points.  The price is spot on for musubi ($4, usually gets you two big rolls, BTW), but you expect it to be better than this was.  Service was quick and friendly here, which is another point in their favor.  And the macaroni salad was decent, so I didn't feel right giving less than two stars.  That Kahlua pork was damn good as well.  I still can't muster more than two stars here.  There are better options out there for your Hawaiian fix, not to mention cheaper as well.  All told, this was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Been going here for the past 5 years and is one of the best Hawaiian grills in Mesa. I love the loco moco and always get the spam masubi. The customer service is amazing I always feel the island vibe every time I walk in."}
{"text":"They give you small portion of meat and are out of everything no chicken , no pineapple coconut ice cream . It's annoying . How can you run a business with everything always out . Unless the cashier don't care for their job and are just saying that . Due to the fact that they pay more attention to  their phones instead of other customers smhh"}
{"text":"Love this place! I don't go often enough because I never pass it. It's close to my neighborhood but I rarely drive in that
direction.

Nonetheless, I'm a big fan! Prices are amazing compared to the quality for \"fast food.\" They prepare the food to order.

Their tender and delicious teriyaki chicken and their garlic shrimp are must-haves for my fam! The BBQ ribs are a hit for the kids too.

Friendly service. Happy place. Casual and relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Try it."}
{"text":"This place is great for tasting the common flavors of Hawaii. They don't have a large Hawaiian food selection but they do have dishes inspired by hawaii's diverse people. My daughters loved the loco moco and garlic shrimp plate. I had the poke bowl, which could use a little more flavor as it's the standard shoyu poke. 
The ambience is very reminiscent of Hawaii, which is my favorite part. Local music feels the hair and for a moment you are taken back home!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for the portion size, but the food is great! I would recommend the loco moco.  I also tried the malasadas, which were pretty good, but not as great as the ones you get in Hawaii.  The staff there are also really friendly.  Would definately recommend this place."}
{"text":"The  restaurant inside is beautiful. But the food is absolutely disgusting if you want to taste real Hawaiian food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you like Hawaiian,Then you will dig this place. I had the Beef (bulkogi) with fish and shrimp too.  This Cam with Rice and Mac salad. Everything was awesome. My daughter ordered the same thing and hadn't had Hawaiian for years and didn't really remember what it was like and she was stoked.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and good but I didn't like how when I was trying to sit done and eat there are ants on the wall next to me and I was eating in the lobby"}
{"text":"For the record, I lived in Hawaii for the past 3 years.

Ordered chicken katsu, ribs, double Mac salad. 2 spam musubis. Poke with white rice. 

Poke was pretty good, flavor was nice. The pieces were big, and im used to smaller pieces.

Mac salad was good. 

Spam musubi was okay, but could be a lil lighter with the rice. Too much rice over powers the spam in my opinion.

The katsu was a bit disappointing. The pieces were small and the flavor was missing something. 

If you're craving some aloha flavors, try this place out. Just don't expect food straight from the island."}
{"text":"My favorite places are the \"hole in the wall\" types, and I've never been a super-stickler about cleanliness of it is just stuff like the tables aren't wiped down fast enough, but over the years Mokis has gotten dirtier and dirtier and its gotten to the point that I'm concerned about food safety. This place used to be a favorite. We especially loved the kalua pork and the lau lau. The potato mac was something I always looked forward too, but unfortunately the last 2 times we visited it just was not good. The Kalua pork wasn't bad, but the lau lau had less than a teaspoon of protein in it, and I'm using the word protein because I couldn't identify what it was. It tasted, felt, and looked like it was just a peice of fat and there were no signs of anything else in the leaf. The potatomac salad was more mayonnaise-y than usual, but it was two times in a row and a few weeks apart, so not likely to be\"just an off day.\" Our teriyaki beef was burned the last time we had it and the portion size was smaller than we had received on other visits when our children ordered kids plates. Pretty disappointed. We'd love to come back, but the last 2 visits and the decline in sanitation make that decision one that we'we not quite ready to make."}
{"text":"This is the first time in a very long time I have stopped at mokis.  I stopped the first week they opened and I would have rated them  3 stars.  Today they only get 2 stars. The first thing I noticed was the strong fish smell. Which almost made me turn and walk out.  now wish I had.  I ordered the 2 meat plate.  I chose Katsu chicken and sticky chicken.  The Katsu was ok and the dipping sauce was good.  The sticky chicken was greasy  and did not have a very good flavor. It came with white rice and a salad. I chose the Hawaiian salad which is pretty good. The company I work for sometimes has catering brought in from mokis and it is better than what I had today.  Maybe it was a bad day? I can still smell the fish odor on my clothes. Yuck!  I'm glad I was on my way home for the day."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Hawaiian restaurant we have found since leaving Maui - just like ohana - aloha - fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out since we were in the area. To be honest I really wanted to go there because I saw they had dole whips. It's a cute place where you go up to the counter to place your order. You have options of meats, rice and sides. We decided to try the kahlua pork,  and chicken katsu with a side of macaroni salad and white rice.  The kahlua pork was tender with a lightly smoked flavor.  I did not care too much for the macaroni salad and rice. My rice seemed a bit under cooked. The chicken katsu was crispy and it came with a sauce.  I wish maybe that there were some sauces we could added to the meat.  Overall it was ok. We all also ordered the dole float. I'll finally definitely go back for that.  I can't say the good was amazing but it was good."}
{"text":"Staff/cashier seemed (to us) she rather be elsewhere than working. Tepid reception. No \"aloha\" attitude in  Hawaiian spot.

Prices were slightly on the pricey side after recieving our dishes. Portions were small for the price they charged us. 

Location is closer to us than Aloha Kitchen... A plus! ^_^
Love the decor, and the al fresca seating.

We also order a coconut smoothie which the server/cashier forgot to serve to us (her mates came over and started socialising instead). We had to remind her that we also order the smoothie a couple of times. Once we recieved it, it was more like a shake than a smothie.

Overall, we are unlikely to return here. Sorry, luvies. Xx"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer at this location for the last 6-7 years. I can tell you that ever since this place sold, the food quality has gone down. It's still decent, but something must have happened to their food quality upon selling the business. I still go occasionally and do enjoy the service."}
{"text":"The mokisada dessert with coconut ice cream is fabulous!!! I enjoy the two meat combo with Katsu chicken. The teriyaki beef can be good but sometimes it's too fatty with grisly pieces. The shredded pork is good too!"}
{"text":"Our server (red headed freckled girl) greeted us by saying a corporate mandated aloha which immediately creeped me out. I'd rather someone greeting me for the first time anywhere to be genuine. (Not her fault she has to). She asked if we'd been there before we said no it was our first time. She ran over the menu with us, most of which she's said so often that she rattled it off faster then I could understand. I picked the 2 meat plate. Ribs & sweet & sour chicken with a Hawaiian salad & rice. My wife got the 1 meat plate with ribs white rice & salad. It's was $26 which was kinda high. It took awhile for the food to come out when it did it was cold. The ribs were very chewy the flavor was ok, the sweet & sour chicken was super wet & the breading just fell off. Not very good. The salad was cold & both myself & my wife didn't like it. The rice was rice. I was offended by a table they had in the building that was talking about religion and God. I didn't understand it was a business that proselytized to their customers I don't support those types of businesses in the first place. Business should be kept out of religion & religion out of business. Now I'm not sure if they are trying to sell me Hawaiian food or recruit me, either way I felt uncomfortable. My wife didn't like anything on her plate and we went somewhere else afterwards to get something to eat that we would enjoy. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The portions are good sized and the price is fair, I just prefer the sauce and macaroni salad at ONO over this place. The staff are friendly and fill your order quickly."}
{"text":"The food is just okay here. My parents really like this place, but I thought it wasn't that great. I got poki and the price was expensive compared to all the other Hawaiian poke places that I have been too, plus the portion size here was tiny! Usually you get big servings at Hawaiian restaurants, but not this one. The staff was nice and friendly though and the restaurant looks cool! I love the decorations."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Moki's but after our last visit I'm not as big of a fan. The food was fine but the portions seemed smaller than usual. We had a groupon and decided to use that. The groupon cost $17 with an advertised value of $28.80. However the advertised value and the actual value are not the same. The groupon was for two 2 meat combos ($9.50 each) and 2 small drinks ($1.99 each). So if you add up the meals and drinks you are only at $22.98 which is nearly $6 off the groupon advertised value. Additionally, when I told the girl I had a groupon she told me I had to pay the tax which would be around $1.84. I've never had to pay additional tax when I've used a groupon before. I used to really love Moki's but after this it seems like they are just misleading with their groupon and trying to rip people off. Unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to stick with another establishment the next time I want some katsu."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a prime example of why you can't always trust 4 stars on Yelp. (Sad face) I have seen a Groupon for this place multiple times and have been curious about the quality since their reviews on here seem to be great. We went during early lunch hour time, was helped promptly at the order counter, was excited to see the full menu & our mouths started watering thinking about this special caloric treat we were about to indulge in. And..... then the let downs started. No soy sauce, just some kind of mix that seemed teriyaki-ish, but whatever, who needs that sodium bottle anyway. Food came out relatively quickly EXCEPT the side order of lau lau which is what we were most excited about, it was delivered to us after we were done with our other plates. We gave the benefit of the doubt because this is a slow cooked item & we thought they were putting love into it... NOT! It was sooooo disgusting, if you've ever had real lau lau, you would understand how horribly prepared this was. After we worked our way through the dried banana leaf portion, we made it to the treasure... NOPE! The leaf was extremely bitter, filled (using the term loosely) with 2 large pieces of fat globules, a few (meaning 3) strips of what seemed to be dried jerky like pork substance. Enough on that, I'm getting upset again just typing it. The Mac salad with no potato, huh? tasted like orange zest & was low on flavor. The Kalbi ribs were so chewy I had to spit some bites into my napkin because I was going to get lock jaw trying to process it. My better half got the chicken katsu & it was just alright. 
Now I have eaten at Ono & thought that was passable but do not choose to eat there, but I would eat there any day in comparison to here.
End note, if you've been to Hawaii, then you know what authentic flavors are, if you are looking for the real deal, go to Aloha Kitchen. They know what they are doing, it's delicious and less expensive and so much better quality!
Was that too harsh? I really dislike wasting hard earned money."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place was clean and the prices were fair. The service was friendly and efficient. I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"You guys. I had a catering order for my husband's 40th birthday party, and they never showed up, they never called. I'm absolutely horrified by this experience. Thank God for Costco and their rotisserie chickens. No one returned my phone calls an hour after expected delivery, and we had 30 hungry guests. Embarrassing and completely unprofessional. Do not give these jerks your business. Please. Ridiculous and not anything like the Aloha spirit you find on the real islands. Big fat BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because we had a groupon . 2 entrees and 2 desserts first all both entrees were at best luke warm, the teriyaki chicken I had was so tough that I couldn't even cut it with the plastic utensils. (broke the tines off the fork) Next when I went to ask for a to go container I asked the cashier to first \"wash her hands\" because she was constantly playing with her HAIR. When I asked for our desserts (the Hawaiian donut the hair playing cashier came over and informed us that they didn't have the ingredients to make it but would \"RUN to the store and pick some up\" 
The cashier who was on duty and placed our order never told us that they didn't have the ingredients but now that cashier would be the one to run to the store.


Also try to find a clean table in the restaurant - I had to ask for a table to be cleaned (since all of them were dirty)


This was our first and definitely our LAST visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really neat authentic Hawaiian restaurant. The food was good I had the teriyaki beef. My friend had the dish with a fried egg on it it looked good too"}
{"text":"Really good, really authentic Hawaiian faire at really fair prices....
Great service, always smiling and friendly, they really make you feel Ohana. :)

We are regulars at this little place and will remain so for many visits to come.
BTW, the first Friday of each month, they throw a Luau for $10/person....great value!

I whole heartedly recommend this place for super good food, good times.  Love the ambience and decor!"}
{"text":"Very disrespectful woman working at the front. She gave me dirty looks and rolled her eyes at me. Took 30 mins for my order (It was not busy, two people eatting) and the shrimp smelled like ammonia. The pineapple was rotten too. I tried this restaurant 2 years ago and had a terrible experience. I thought to give it another try and I am super disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for my first time yesterday and my experience was super interesting. The staff was so unprofessional. They were yelling and treating it like they were just hanging out. They were really loud and just not aware that people were trying to eat dinner. 

The food is ok. I've had better Hawaiian good."}
{"text":"Had to kill some time and was hungry so I found Mokis. I had the teriyaki chicken and Hawaiian salad as a side. The food was good and flavorful but for $9.00 a bit pricey for the amount you get. Maybe you get less rice and salad in the \"to go\" box than the eat in plate."}
{"text":"I have no reason to give them less stars. They were friendly,explained the things I didn't know. Explained the groupon choices. It was all I expected and I will go back. The food was great,cooked perfect. The sauces were flavorful. It's casual, Hawaiian music. Looking forward to gong back and watching the fire dance sometime. Thank you for being kind.."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. It's the best Hawaiian Food out there. They do Luau's on many occasions. They also cater, even did my wedding. Perfect Lynch meal with a two Meat combo. Chicken Katsu and Kulua Pork are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The kulua pork, chicken katsu and Spanish salad are my favorite items from this joint. Even the rice are so moist and delicious. I move back to AZ a few months ago and discover this place! So happy.

The staffs are so nice there too!"}
{"text":"Brings the taste of the islands here in AZ.  We have been eating here for several years and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Best Ever!!! Always stop by when I'm in the neighborhood.   Btw they do a buffet the first Friday of every month!"}
{"text":"Was hosting a Hawaiian themed baby shower and needed a Hawaiian caterer.  We checked out many of the Hawaiian places around town and Moki's was the best.  It tasty and at a good price.  Lisa & Eric were easy to work with and accommodating of our requests (like needing vegetarian options).  They were punctual the night of the shower and very professional. We provided tables and tablecloths and they did all the set up.  They even stayed to serve the food.  I look forward to eating at their restaurant next."}
{"text":"we went all the way up to phoenix from tucson for the day and to my dismay, L&L hawaiian bbq had closed its doors for business just a couple weeks ago.

i had my heart set on eating some hawaiian food before heading back to tucson, and yelp recommended this place.

we walked in and the place pretty much looked like it could have been an L&L. it was clean and neat.

the chick behind the counter was haole (white) but was pretty friendly. i didn't have to look at the menu much because i pretty much knew what i wanted!! bbq chicken!!

the husband ordered the chicken katsu, which was nice and crisp, but the 'katsu' sauce was something like 1000 island dressing. a bit weird. when the lady dropped off my bbq chicken at the table, it was actually mainland style bbq chicken. like.... bbq sauce, bbq chicken. ooooh what a disappointment. i definitely wasn't satisfied, so i walked back to the counter to ask why it was what it was. 

my bad for not reading the menu. what i really wanted was teriyaki (bbq) chicken. back home in hawaii, when you walk into a plate lunch joint and ask for bbq chicken, teriyaki bbq chicken is what you get. the lady that brought out our food could see that i was pretty bummed about my selection and gave me three pieces of teriyaki bbq chicken. oooooohhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyygggggggooooooosssssshhhhh sooo ono (delicious)!!!! so delicious, in fact, that i ordered an extra plate to take back to tucson with me.

the food was okay over all, but i think that for calling themselves a hawaiian grill they should get with the lingo of the islands and call food by their proper names.

i might consider going back to moki's if i'm ever out in phoenix again."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and when i went in to use it they changed it. The groupon i purchased for was two deserts and two combo plates for two. Recently the groupon changed to the two drinks but the one I purchased for for deserts. When I went to use it the girl was oh we changed it. Dont advertise and sell something than change it up also known as bait and switch! Plus you really dont get a deal with this groupon because you get less meat."}
{"text":"We came to Moki's Hawaiian last evening and generally had a nice time. 

Over the Holidays we were given a gift card and decided to try it out. The food was good and the place was empty when we first arrived. That didn't last long. By the time we left, all the seats (photo) were taken and there was a line six deep. 

Our favorite was their Teriyaki Chicken. It was delicious with a hint of citrus and honey.  The Pulled Pork was okay, but not as flavorful as the chicken. 

Expect to pay $12 with a soft drink, which is very fair given all the food they give you for one of their Combo meals (see attached menu)."}
{"text":"I love love moki's. I would highly recommend it to anyone! Great food and great service"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to Hawaiian food. Kaluau pork is my favorite and a lot of places don't serve it at all or every day based on the cooking time so my options are limited. I will give them credit for delicious Kaluau pork every day. Then there's the \"teriyaki chicken.\" I ordered extra teriyaki sauce because this is not my first time coming here and I like the sauce on my pork and rice. I was brought a plate with a bone dry piece of chicken and one tiny cup of sauce that normally comes with teriyaki chicken. When I tell the girl I paid for extra she said the \"teriyaki\" chicken doesn't come with it and the little cup I paid for was the \"extra side.\" She even went to the back and claimed to talk to her and she confirmed that their chicken comes dry but that I could pay for more even though this is definitely not my first time here and ordering the dish although it's been a few years since I've been in the area. After hearing my argument everyone in line shelled out money for extra extra sauce. I paid $14 for a baby scoop of macaroni salad a tiny serving size of pork and half a small chicken breast with plenty of rice. I know things are more expensive in Hawaii but this is Arizona and this place is a total rip off. Rumbi's taste much better for half the price (but they don't have the pork unfortunately). Aloha Kitchen puts this place to shame but they only do pork certain days of the week. I should have walked next door to Jack In The Box and had them load me up with teriyaki sauce packets for free on their teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Ugh. WHAT has happened to my beloved Moki's? Gone are the smiling faces and words of welcome from the owners and staff as you arrive. The young lady at the counter greeted us with an \"Aloha\" while a second teenager stared blankly from behind the her.

Our main dishes were tasty, as usual, but the portions seem to have gotten smaller while the prices have increased.

The biggest issue came after our meal, when we decided to share a mokisada. If you have never had the pleasure of enjoying this awesome Moki's dessert, let me just tell you that when it's made correctly it is GREAT! Tonight however....

My son placed the order, and we then proceeded to wait for more than 20 minutes before my husband finally approached the counter to inquire about the wait. He was told \"Yeah. It'll be done soon.\" The gal had been taking a very large order up front, but the bleary-eyed kid behind her had been standing there staring into space the entire time. A third fellow was cooking in the back. After she finished her work at the register, the girl went back and made our dessert herself. She then set it on our table with some spoons and walked away.

I might have tolerated the long wait, had our mokisada been correct. Ours was missing strawberries/sauce, and whipped cream. My husband again approached the counter to ask for a side of those things to add to the dish. The girl informed him that the store was out of strawberries and whipped cream, so we were given extra pineapple (6 pieces is extra?), ice cream and caramel.

I'm sorry. If I order a dish that you cannot correctly prepare, I would expect you to let me know so I have the option not to purchase it! Do not make something vaguely similar, and then plop it down in front of your customer without explanation, I guess hoping we'll notice an extra swirl of caramel and some vanilla ice cream and be cool with it?

Sure, we probably got our money's worth with an extra scoop of ice cream, but we were not given what we ordered, there was no apology, and they didn't even say anything until we asked them outright. My son was on the verge of sleep by the time our mokisada arrived, so we cut our losses and left.

I'm sad. I want the Moki's of old back. I'm not sure I'll know if that ever happens, though, because I don't think we'll be returning. :- ("}
{"text":"Cute little tiny place, with big future ahead! The girl working was really nice and friendly. My bf is from Hawaii and he misses it so much. This is the only Hawaiian restaurant I know that sells laulau. Found them on Groupon and this is our first try getting food there (ordered to go cuz it's already late) and we loved it there! Prices were affordable and reasonable. Music was awesome! Perfect with the theme they got going. We are definitely coming back to dine in next time for sure when we have time it was almost a 40minute drive! I gave 4 stars because it was a bit of a drive.. If only they were by Phoenix or somewhere closer downtown ^_^"}
{"text":"Only thing missing is the mushrooms from the Loco Moco...Kauai style like Obsessions Cafe.
Service is pretty poor as it is walk up counter with bored teens working but the food is legit and keeps me craving more"}
{"text":"bland flavorless boiled meat.... i got teriyaki pork, yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thought was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless. my friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table. she also got the vgitarian bowl and it was frozen mixed veggies, carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for $7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold.. the pinapple on the plate was still green and totally unripe. the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies.. i wouldnt waste your money here.. go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I'm somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. This place has pretty good food. I like that they have kalua pork, which other Hawaiian places don't have. I also like that I don't HAVE to have the macaroni salad, but I don't like the fact that sometime things are over salted. Their rice is always perfect and leaves me wanting more than two scoops.This place does satisfy cravings I have for good rice plates, and they also have a pretty diverse menu. 

They also have luau's once a month that's $10 for all you can eat food and drink with music. I haven't been, but am thinking about checking it out..."}
{"text":"Service is -5 doesn't care about any thing. table are dirty and sticky and doesn't know how to clean up. Wrong food and didn't care to handle any thing, or come back to explain dry chicken with wrong sauce. I get impression she want's to make sure customer don't come back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is delicious and healthy. The staff is friendly and fast. 10/10"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this treasure from none other than YELP!  Mokis is tucked on the back section of a stripmall.  While a little difficult to find at first, it was worth.  I had a combo plate with katsu and teriyaki beef while my husband got the kalua pig.  All three were AMAZING, but the teriyaki beef was the winner for me!  We also got the hawaiian salad on the side (also yummy).  If you like mixing food, this worked well with the kalua pig.  We will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Had the Ohana plate. Mahi mahi was terrible, dry, no flavor, just salt. Coconut shrimp had no flavor except grease. Chicken was ok. Not worth the price. My daughter said her chicken catsu was also flavorless. But they have Dole whip, just like Disneyland's Tiki room. Not cheap, but it's Dole whip! Will return for that alone."}
{"text":"Haven't been for a while because of a previous bad experience with the staff. I had a craving for some local Hawaiian food and decided to pick up lunch here. I ordered at 12:31 pm and received my food 30 minutes later. While waiting two customers behind me received their food. One of the customers had the same plate I ordered and the other what looks like had the same plate my wife ordered. Not sure what happened but received no response from the employees just a stare. When I finally received my food from one of the employees all she just repeated our order and concentrated on getting the order number sign from us. 

As far as the food. Menu prices on line is much different (less) than at location. Food was just ok. It tastes the same as Onos and L&L. Not much difference. Much less portions than before. 

Thanks again for the great awful experience Mokis."}
{"text":"Moki's won't blow your mind, but it's a decent place to satisfy your Hawaiian food cravings at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"As an all time yelper.. I'd have to say I'm a tough critic and this place got me! Their food is phenomenal. It's a little far from where I live but it's worth the drive! I had an awesome groupon deal for two meat combos for 2 with 2 drinks for $17! It was a steal! I had the pork and sticky chicken with the brown rice and Hawaiian salad.. the salad was light and fresh, it definitely balanced out the meats. The pork was just perfect moist and and not too salty.. pork can easily get too salty.. 

My husband had the beef terryaki and it was just so good.. it tasted smoky which gave it it's authenticity! The ambiance was chill.. I'd give it a 5 for fast foodish. I'll def come back again!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this to Moki's since they've gotten such good reviews ahead of me, but I have to. First off, let me admit; this is my first time eating Hawaiian food, so maybe it's just not my cup of tea. BUT, this food was horrid.

Moki's is in the shopping center right next to where I work and I had seen it many times and it never looked busy so I thought, \"meh, must not be very good.\". I came to Yelp today to see what people thought and was surprised by all of the great reviews! And since I was craving a teriyaki rice bowl-type lunch, I decided to give this place a shot. I called in ahead and ordered the combo plate with teriyaki beef and the Kalua pork, both of which came recommended by previous reviewers. I ordered it with brown rice (my attempt at being health conscious) and the pasta salad. I was quoted 10 minutes and arrived right about then. The interior is just like any other strip mall restaurant. The girl working there was very nice. I got my food, paid and left... really excited for the delicious food I was about to partake in!

When I got back in my car I noticed a smell. The smell was quite honestly, repulsive. It smelled like a body rotting in a a months worth of garbage. I'm not even lying. It wasn't super strong since the food was in a box and the box in a bag, but it was bad enough to make me question whether or not I would be able to eat it. I got back to work, sat down in the breakroom and opened up my meal. Meh. It didn't really look very good. I first tasted the pasta salad and it was really lackluster. It didn't have much flavor at all, it just tasted like plain pasta and potatoes with a little (very little) mayo mixed in. Next I tried the Kalua pork. It was tender, no doubt about that, but completely flavorless. I kept wondering if maybe there was supposed to be a sauce on it that was forgotten. I could see spices but couldn't taste anything. Then I moved on to the teriyaki beef. At first glance I could see that it was dry. It tasted dry and again, had very little flavor. The brown rice was sitting in a pool of water, but at least it tasted like brown rice. I think the tastiest thing on the plate was the pineapple wedge. I ate one piece of the beef and a couple of bites of the pork and salad and rice and threw the meal away. What a waste of almost $10. I was anything BUT impressed. Oh and remember the smell I mentioned? A co-worker came in the breakroom shortly after I threw the food away and immediately plugged her nose in disgust and said \"something smells horrible back here\". I just kind of giggled and began to open my mouth when another co-worker said \"oh there was rotten brocolli that got thrown away earlier\". I just left it at that. I didn't want to admit that I had just eaten food that smelled like rotten brocolli mixed with death and garbage.

Never again would I eat at Moki's."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The girl at the front was super friendly and welcoming! Loved the beef teriyaki with the sticky rice and macaroni salad...will definitely be back and hopefully next time save room for a dole whip or shake:)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my boyfriend here; he's Polynesian and he loves this kind of stuff. We walked in and the first thing I noticed was that the decorations were super cute and fun. The outdoor seating was really cute as well, so that's where we decided to sit especially because it was super nice outside. I was looking at the menu debating if we should go somewhere else because I couldn't believe how expensive everything was. I was thinking that the portions must be huge. Nope, I was wrong. They weren't small, but they definitely weren't $10 worth. Especially since rice took up half the plate! Definitely over priced.
Also, the wait was super long for it not being that busy. After waiting for a while, my little brother's and boyfriends food came out first and I had to wait an extra 5 minutes for my food. Not sure why I had to wait so long, but I was just annoyed by this point. The food honestly wasn't that bad, but again, I expected better from the pricing. I got the katsu chicken, and it was pretty good. Overall, we probably won't be back because there are better and cheaper island grills around t"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you're assaulted with a decor that some people think represents Hawaii: surfboards, pineapples, a smattering of \"exotic\" words and sayings, twangs on a uke overhead, and bold splashes of green and blue. Very, very slick and expected marketing. 

As you can tell, this is a turn-off for me, because it's inauthentic. It's a little much. But the food is decent. The grilled mahi mahi plate is actually good because the fish tastes fresh (for AZ) and there is a brown rice option. The mac salad is a little bland and the dipping sauces simply confuse me. They bring nothing to the items on the plate. I've also had the katsu (breaded fried chicken) which was ok, but didn't hit the right note."}
{"text":"I've been going to Moki's for about a year, always for lunch.  The portions are generous, and seemed to be cooked to order.  The grilled Mahi Mahi is awesome, as is their spinach salad.  The staff is always friendly, even to us Haoles!  j/k.  Great staff and very good food."}
{"text":"We discovered Mokis on groupon and loved it! The food is simply delicious, the staff is friendly, and the upbeat experience is fun. The first Friday of each month the host a luau night from 6pm to 8pm, which includes a scrumptious buffet and last night had really fun Haka dancers. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great! Greeted by a nice aloha, then asked if we have ever been there along with suggestions of what dishes I should try. 

Being from Hawaii, living in Texas, visiting Arizona, I just wanted to try EVERYTHING because I miss it. 

Ordered the Kal-bi with a spinach salad and two scoops of rice also got an order of poke!!!

Both were incredibly delicious. The Kal-bi was cooked just right, the pieces were smaller than what I'm used to back home, but there was a decent amount that was given and sweet tasting. The poke, was nice and cold mixed with shoyu and green onions. I think there was some chili peppers mixed with it because there was a kick to it in some bites. 

Great place and if I had more time here, I would go back!"}
{"text":"Solid Polynesian fare that will leave you full and singing Don Ho.   The Kahlua pork is the reason to get you in the door but there are several other items that make a good meal."}
{"text":"I came here for the Spam musubi and it's unfortunately not very good. It looks like they were premade, wrapped in saran wrap, and then nuked before serving. The spam doesn't feel like it's fried and the rice is super chewy. The spam to rice ratio leans heavy on the rice :("}
{"text":"Ok, this place was not clean. Tables were not wiped, chairs were all over the place, trach cans were overflowing, floors were dirty, finished plates were on table still. Overall, dirty!

Food was alright, i've had better hawaiian food. Presentation wasn't impressing. Rice scoops were for babies. Islanders have huge appetites so it was shocking to see i got so little. It did fill me up though, cuz i ordered three meats and helped my sister finish her food lol! 

The place wasnt loud, so it was somewhat peaceful. 

Service, felt bad for the cute girl. She was doing everything herself. Serving food, wiping tables, clearing tables, cashier, and making desserts. She seemed calm so i think she did a great job, but alot of work on her hands. 

I gave two stars just because i was disappointed. 

Pics came out nice though. Lol

I would recommend this as a last resort if u r hungry?"}
{"text":"A Different Twist.

The food at Mokis  Grill is good, the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating. On this visit I had the sweet and sour chicken plate and my dinner companion had the katsu and teriyaki chicken. The combo plates come with white rice and macaroni salad and I have to admit I am not a fan of macaroni salad but the macaroni salad at Mokis Grill     is really good.

The portions are a good size and great if you dont want to have a heavier meal. Definitely not bad for a fast food."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious,  fresh - made,  full of flavor, and they are always staffed by the sweetest kids! Bring the family,  this place is awesome! When the weather is cooler,   outdoor seating on the patio cannot be beat! Almost feels like the islands!"}
{"text":"Bought the groupon today to try this place out. We ordered the two meat Kalbi rib combo plate with macaroni salad and brown rice to go. We got home and opened the carry out box. There was three slices of long pieces of meat. It smelled great but it tasted like sour beef. The meat was really chewy, you would think you were chewing on meat flavored gum. This had to be old meat that was sitting out re-heated and served. We threw out the meat and just ate the brown rice and macaroni salad. We won't be coming back. I just hope we don't get sick."}
{"text":"Luau!!! (Not sure if I spelled that correctly) this place is awesome. So friendly and the food is DELICIOUS! And ever first Friday is all you can eat grub. I'm loving this place and will be back often."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Have not been for awhile. Everything was great as usual, except for the teriyaki beef. Very dry. I asked for some teriyaki sauce, and they asked me to pay for it. You purchase Katsu Chicken, they give you Katsu sauce for free. You buy Teriyaki beef, you should get teriyaki sauce for free. Done deal. Cut corners in other areas. Speaking of cutting corners, the plastic ware is so flimsy, you almost have to eat everything with your hands. Katsu chicken was excellent though. Cashier/server could use some remedial customer service classes."}
{"text":"Meat is always cold. Don't know why, I feel it's made to order but somehow it always comes to the table cold. Been eating here about four times a year for the last six years and it's always the same... cold meat. They probably just don't care enough to change how they're doing things. They did start serving Dole Whip which we love so that's nice."}
{"text":"1st visit: soda fountain was broken during the entire meal. Staff said nothing.
2nd visit: over 20 minute wait for food with 2 people ahead of me.
3rd visit: soda fountain on the fritz again
4th visit: called the order in ahead of time to avoid the wait. When I showed up they had no record of the order."}
{"text":"For being a fast Hawaiian food joint Mokis is great! Way better than the Ono Hawaiian grill places. The food at Mokis is fresh and tastey. I always get the BBQ chicken and love it. The macaroni salad is good and I usually dont like macaroni salad. Mokis is affordable and in a quiet location. The staff has always been nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I live near Tucson, but whenever I have business in the Valley, I never fail to stop at Moki's. I even stopped on the way back to home from Sedona last month.
I'm very familiar with Hawaiian cuisine, so this place ROCKS! 
Everything I've tried has been outstanding.
We have a couple of Hawaiian places in Tucson, but they're no comparison to Moki's. Furthermore, I don't want Haoli's making my local food, and that's what you get with the Tucson Hawaiian restaurants. 
Moki's, you'll always have my business. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Hawaiian food. Chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki are good. Macaroni salad !!  Fresh and fast"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place because it's way closer than the other Hawaiian grill but I was a little disappointed. Although the restaurant itself had a cute and neat Hawaiian feel to it, I feel that they may need more help when it starts getting busy. Felt real bad for the one guy cooking while the other guy who was there booked off when it started picking up. The girl there at the cashier was nice. It was disappointing because we waited for almost 25 mins for our to go order. The portion of food was okay for its price. Fish and chips was a little dry and macaroni salad wasn't too great. I had a mango coconut smoothie and it was very delicious. I think it's what kept me happy the whole time. All in all, I will return for the dessert but not so much for the food. Hoping that with time this place will pick up on their service. :)"}
{"text":"reasons why i like mokis
1) you aren't obligated to choose between just rice and mac salad. you can actually get a diff kind of salad. i recommend the hawaiian salad.
2) you can get brown rice!!!!
3) they have a really delicious rice topping. black sesame seeds and sea salt? i dunno actually. but it's good.
4) the katsu sauce is not your average red-brown sauce. it's a creamier version, and it is sooooooo good.

if you choose to try out mokis (and i hope you do!) i'd recommend trying the kalua pork and the katsu. the katsu is nothing spectacular, but it does come with that really awesome sauce. the teriyaki chicken is pretty good as well. 

get your food to-go. i honestly think they give you more food in the to-go boxes. plus, you usually have left overs, so it's all ready to go home with you! a nice plus - if you buy entertainment books, they usually have a buy one get one free/or half off deal."}
{"text":"I found myself in Mesa of all places yesterday around noon.  I checked Yelp and decided to try Moki's.

The decor is obviously Hawaiian style and the ladies who work here are very nice.

I decided to have the Kalua pork plate lunch.  It comes with two scoops of rice and I ordered the macaroni side.

The portions are very generous and the pork was very tasty.

My only complaint is the iced tea.  It's some kind of sweetened Nestea and not fresh brewed.  I'd recommend that they get something like China Mist and then let people sweeten it themselves if they like it that way.

I'm glad I tried Moki's and will surely stop in again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Long time customer here!

I really like the quality of ingredients here. Other small Hawaiian joints use cheap chicken and the taste comes through. 

All white meat on the Katsu! The mac salad is to die for! 

Wanna try something really different not on the menu?
Order Loco Moco but order Katsu in place of the burger patty!

So freaking good!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty!!! Been coming here for years. Chicken Katsu is the best with the spinach salad!  The spam masubi is good, as well as the sweet and sour chicken, which isn't too sweet.  I do not like the pork kaluai or the macaroni salad. Hubby had the ribs on our last visit and he said they were tough and wouldn't get them
again.   I think they are a little pricey for being a walk up and order restaurant, but they did have a good Groupin deal recently. 
They have one of the best desserts, Grandma's chocolate cake and you have to get it with the coconut ice cream!!! Yummmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Hawaii I can say the food and atmosphere are legit.  Definitely not a chain place..and they have a lot more on the menu the other Hawaiian BBQs such as malasadas and poke.  We really liked the Katsu, Kailua Pork and Kalbi plate lunches with all fixings.  We've already been back within the same week after our initial visit.  Solid local grinds..can't wait to check out the luau."}
{"text":"Posted prices on wall were not honored when rung up at higher price.  Staff explained owner was out of town and she was not able to change it.  Cancelled half my order.  Teriyaki chicken was very good.  Restaurant was clean.  Staff friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places we have eaten at in a long time. The rice was so hard it felt like I was chewing on rocks. I don't mean hard like under cooked, I mean hard like didn't get cooked at all. The sweet and sour chicken was mediocre, it taste like it was from Panda Express. The soda fountain was out of ice and the staff seemed bothered by us asking for ice. The cashier looked absolutely miserable. Just a really bad experience in every way. What a waste of $59."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an uncomfortable lunch experience at Moki's.  I will say first that the food was good!  The factors that caused our experience to be negative would be easy to eliminate.

We were greeted when we entered.  When I said that we had a Groupon, he said, \"Great! [I don't remember her name] will help you,\" and handed our paper Groupon to a young lady.  She stood for a long time, staring at her phone as customers lined up behind us.  She finally told us that the Groupon number was invalid.  I suggested that we let the people behind us order, and we could try redeeming the Groupon on my phone.  She agreed.  The entire exchange was very flat and businesslike--a smile would have gone a long way.

When I bought the Groupon, I saw that it was for meat combos.  I don't typically eat meat, but places we've visited in the past have been happy to accommodate me for an additional charge.  When I asked if it would be possible to pay extra to have fish instead of pork or chicken, her response was a flat \"No.\"  Again, no smile, and no attempt at all to be flexible or to explain why flexibility was impossible under the circumstances.

I took my cup and went to find a table while my husband got his drink.  Of the eight or ten tables available, I found only two that were clean--most had rice, spilled sauce, and/or drink rings remaining from prior customers.  The cleanest table was directly under the flat screen television, at which the couple at the table next to us stared fixedly during most of our meal.

The food, as I said before, was hot, flavorful, well-prepared, and plentiful (especially if you like meat!).  When I went to the counter to request a take-home box, the original host that greeted us helped me pleasantly and promptly.

After filling our to-go box, I attempted to clear our table and got another unpleasant surprise.  The large wastebasket by the door was the type that has a lid connected in the center, and flips up when you drop something through on one side.  The lid was about 70% covered with a layer of food and grease--I couldn't touch it to scrape my plate or deposit our napkins.  The shelves next to the wastebasket were stacked with dirty plastic dishes; I would estimate 15-20 dishes, at the very least.  I gingerly laid our two stacked dishes on the lowest pile and got out the door.

Good food means a lot, and I'm happy to go out of my way to find it.  However, unless it is accompanied by pleasant service and cleanliness, it's not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because someone told me it was good and closer to where I work I tried it I'd rather go to Hawaii bbq off alma school road in front of mesa community college 

1. I tried calling to order ahead because I'm on lunch the person said can you hold I held for 2 minutes I called back they didn't answer so I went up there to order I walk in there's only 4 people who were customers don't know why I needed to hold 

2. I got the two meat plate the chicken teriyaki and the ribs the chicken. Was undercooked it was still PINK the ribs had all fat on it no actual meat on it 

3. The Macaroni salad is always my favorite but how they make theirs it's disgusting 

3 save your self 12 bucks and go to Hawaiian bbq off alma school road 

Never again"}
{"text":"Saw this on a Groupon offer awhile and decided to give it a shot. Had the Teriyaki beef with rice. It was awesome: tender, juicy and flavorful. The slaw that came with it was also delicious. However the true star of the meal was the dessert. They had a macadamia nut cake with coconut pineapple ice cream *DROOL is all I can say. A perfect ending to a meal. Will absolute be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty legit Hawaiian food.  I like that it is small establishment. A little pricey, but the flavor of the food is very good.They have a combo deal with meat, rice, and salad. 
Kalua pork is good. It tastes like stuff I've had in Hawaii
I like the option for brown or white rice. 
The Hawaiian salad was pretty tasty the last time I was here, but today it had a bitter taste to it.  
Spam masubi is pretty good too, but also a little pricey. One roll for $3. 
Overall a very legit and cute place, but could be a little pricey."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've came here three time already and customer service was always on point. The last time I came there was a long line but the food came out to each family in about 10-15 minutes so it was quick. My favorite items here were the makasadas and poki! I highly recommend those. My son loved their garlic shrimp but everything I've had was great."}
{"text":"Want a taste of Hawaiian-Polynesian food? Then this is the place to go in the east valley. Beware! You will walk out satisfied.  Ono BBQ has nothing on this place! Moki's here to stay!

Well marinated beef and chicken teriyaki that is a must order on the menu. As well this is one of the few places that I can find, the Loco Moco Hawaiian style dish that can change your life for the better. They also have islander's favorite \"grab and go\" snack, spam musubi is on their menu!! Everything on the menu is prepared well and every bite makes you want to have more.

I recommend to attend on a Friday for the Buffet and a little live show. Be advised, it will be packed! Great clean atmosphere and service.

This is the closest you can get to real Hawaiian-Polynesian Dishes here in the east valley of Mesa."}
{"text":"Love the Teriyaki Beef and Chicken Katsu! Good service too."}
{"text":"My family and I have visited this place for almost a decade now and have enjoyed their food. For a graduation party we've had their food catered (Kalua pork). I wish their selection of milkshakes was still as large as it once was. I'm only docking a star because of our recent visit. From what I'm guessing, they're under new management, as evidenced by the staff. When we entered, the tables weren't cleaned off and were sticky. Next time we will try the outdoor seating (when we would visit Moki's in the past they did not have outdoor seating)."}
{"text":"I've been to Moki's over the years and they are very consistent. Everyone is greeting you as soon as you walk in. The restaurant takes your order at the counter. The menu is very good with options and not overwhelming. You grab your cup and fill your drink then take a seat. The space is very intimate so don't be shy! 
The waitress bring you freshly cooked to order food that is amazing. Lots a good colors, textures and flavors. The food comes out with a good presentation too! I really like the teriyaki beef or chicken and the spam rice roll. I've never had to wait very long to get my food either. Lunch or dinner it seems to come out pretty quick as the cooks are good at what they do. 
All together a great place, but I will say the prices for this type of restaurant are a bit high. It is self serve drinks. You do order at a counter and based on total quantity of food received I just don't get the complete package for 5 stars. Don't get me wrong you much go to experience but budget wise it could be hard to stop in weekly."}
{"text":"Love! The Teriyaki beef and the Kalua Pork  with the mac salad and and rice. For dessert I had the Grandmas Caramel Chocolate Cake. Now let me tell you about this cake...heavenly! It's Chocolate cake with caramel and topped with macadamia nuts, whipped cream, toffee and a side of coconut ice cream. If you're trying to watch the calories, this spot is not for you. But know you won't be disappointed with the food they have to offer. 

Also there are a few items I would consider 'secret menu' items. I'm from Hawaii and it had been awhile since I had manapua and when I mentioned it the lady who was helping me was totally cool and told me they could make it for me even though it wasn't on the menu! Score! Yea, I'm a happy camper (Polynesian) :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving something a little different for dinner. I glanced through the reviews of a couple Hawaiian places and went with Mokis. I thought maybe I can ignored the lower ratings because the items on the menus looked pretty authentic...

So Wrong...

The Pros:
Very friendly employees. They're all either in their teens or very early twenties so I really doubted their culinary experience... But they were very friendly and attentive. 
Hawaiian salad was pretty food
The fried doughnut with icecream and fruits dessert was DELISH! So much sugar, so much diabetes, but so good!

The Cons:
Dirty tables and trash cans piled high even with only a few customers. 
Food lack consistency in taste. Some of us ordered the same beef teriyaki but they didn't taste the same for some reason...
Macaroni Salad was meh
TINY TINY TINY portion for a pretty steep price... I'm used to MASSIVE portions from other Hawaiian place. 


Overall, I won't be back. They really need to work on both quantity and quality."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Quality of food and service is always outstanding! Delicious food!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place but tonight the service was absolutely horrible!! First off they were out of kalbi and spam Musubi!! The excuse from hostess was it was a busy night. That's seriously not an excuse you should say to a paying customer. Then! It took forever to get my food- over 40min and 3 other parties received food before me. I ordered two meat plate of katsu and beef and then a plate of shrimp and thats it! One other dad and dtr left so upset because it took so long for their food to be served. I asked how much longer for my food the first time and she asked \"what'd your order again\" so I told her. No update. I asked 10 min later and she said \"what'd you order again\" seriously?!? I repeated my order and she said Oh here it is it just came out. It was my Katsu and beef and she said that's it. I said NO I'm still waiting for my shrimp. The cooks in back looked like they had no idea about it. And told me they were just waiting for my katsu to be done. I showed them the plate like It's right here..... .... suddenly they had a plate of shrimp there for who knows how long sitting there and said \"oh are you table 6??\" Like YES I am actually. What the hell is happening there?!? No idea what they're doing or how to respond to customers.


Only pro is that the food is still good. Too bad they don't even have it in stock ...

Just checked and my order is wrong .. it's chicken teriyaki instead of beef and they gave me salad instead of macaroni salad. Awesome....."}
{"text":"The service? Good. Ambience? Good. Food? Ok. 

I've had Hawaiian food and this does not live up to it.
I had white rice, macaroni salad, chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki. The teriyaki had good flavor, but everything else did not. I had to go home and add salt to everything. The katsu was also really, really dry.

If you want Hawaiian food, Moki''s will do the trick, but if you want good hawaiian food, this is not the place for you. If Moki's seasons everything and generally improves the quality of the food I'd be happy to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the Kalua Pork. I used to get the Teriyaki Chicken but my family accidentally got me the pork and I never went back. I usually get the double meat (two portions) with the Macaroni salad and white rice. They changed the Macsroni salad a while back (I like the old one better) but I still like it. Love the little black seeds the my use for seasoning (no idea what they're called).  They just updated the floor and made some decor changes. Looks good. Great job!"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night at Moki's, which is very much open. It was soooo delicious! I had the Ohana platter with bbq salmon, teriyaki chicken and breaded shrimp with rice and potato mac salad and my husband had Loco Moco with sirloin patty, 2 eggs and gravy over rice with potato mac salad. It was all wonderful and nothing was left when we were done!!!
We will definitely be coming back. For dessert we tried Grandma's Chocolate cake with coconut ice cream. It was heavenly...homemade, even the ice cream! We brought an Ohana platter to go to our daughter and she wolfed it down! My husband got the Spam sushi to go too and loved it. Everything fresh and homemade is why we will be coming back!!! The bonus is the service with Aloha and Mahalo!!!"}
{"text":"the ony reason i gave a star cause the donuts were awsome.  This place is dirty in the back as well as the front. Tables weren't cleaned off.  There is no wait staff you order at the counter and pick up at the counter.  We used a groupon, we were treated like dirt, never go there again.  Our groupon included 2 entrees valued 8.95 each and 2 deserts at 5.95 eachThe fish was smaller that a childs plate, burnt and dried out I got a fork full of spinach for a salad with none of the ingredients listed.  The owner humileated us by yelling at us like children when she said we could only get one desert and when I went out to the car and showed her what the groupon included she insisted we would only get one desertl
Stay away dirty, rude,shady people runing this place"}
{"text":"The food here was alright.  Nothing spectacular.  The service was really subpar and I don't know, the waitress must have been high or something.  

The food didn't taste bad, but it also wasn't a wowzer.  Ono is much better."}
{"text":"My favorite Hawaiian BBQ place in town. My favorite is the katsu and the kolbi beef ribs. The manapua is a little too spiced for my liking but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for real Hawaiian food, look elsewhere.  If you have an immature palate, do not know how to cook, and frequent places like McDonald's, Burger King, and Taco Bell, you'll probably love this place.

Service: The girl packaging my food picked her nose before touching my to-go boxes. The servers and cook looked like they were in their late teens or young 20s.

Food: I ordered the Ohana Plate, and while the chicken and shrimp were flavorful, the fish was stale, like it had been sitting on the warmer for a few hours.  Also, the intensity of the fish smell was not something that I was expecting: it was not overwhelming, but resembled a rotting odor.

This is a review based on one experience. Bottom line is that while I'd like to give them another try, I don't think it's worth it given the other options for cheap Hawaiian food. I think that a different batch of servers and a different cook would probably result in a better experience and conceivably better tasting food.  I've eaten at Ono multiple times and while it's not perfect, I prefer it over Mokis."}
{"text":"Good kine food
Good kine music 

But no can smile? Wheres the aloha braddah when u frown all day? 

Shoots!"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon to get two mixed plates and two desserts for $14. First, the atmosphere was unique. They actually had Hawaiian decor and music. It created a good ambient feel. I waited above average time to have my order placed. I found it difficult to order due to the lack of pictures. I understand that it's Hawaiian, but not everyone knows what kalua and ohana are, just by the title. 

The food was fantastic. I was disappointed in the amount of meat that was given and the Hawaiian salad was not on par with others I've had. The meat was amazing, the rice was bomb and the tangy sauce is my new favorite. 

I will revisit Mokis, but not paying full price. Will be waiting til another Groupon is available."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the quality of the restaurant as we had Mokis catered last month.  We ordered the Roasted Pig for little Luau theme party we had.  The cost was $300 for the pig.  We thought the price was high but thought it would be worth it to have the experience of having a roasted pig.  Mokis claims the pig will feed 30-35 people.  No way...and no, we are not a bunch of fatsos.  I've had roasted pig like this at other parties and it was probably twice as big.  Anyway, so the size of the pig was a disappointment...AND we had to carve it all up when it came to the party.  The other times we ordered a whole pig, the restaurant delivers it and carves it up for you.  But you live and learn. I just wish I would've seen a review so I knew what to expect earlier, because I would definetly not order it again.

We also ordered some type of fried rice and salad.  They were incredibly good. 

I'd probably order from Mokis again, but I would definetly NOT recommend the whole roasted pig.  Too much money for not much meat."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. And really not in a good way at all. I asked about just ordering a side of chicken, and was told \"sure, it'll come in this bowl, full\", charged $12. Then they bring it out to me, 6, seriously 6 little bite size chunks of chicken. Didn't even fill half of the bowl they put it in. They did cook up some more to actually make a full serving. But definitely not $12 worth. Even the 2 meat plate is cheaper. The front counter needs to step up their game and learn their position."}
{"text":"Try the chicken Katsu!! The sauce they give you is amazing. I've been back twice since my first visit and the staff is very friendly and explain the menu. The prices are reasonable also. Check it out"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here today to try out their food. Guess what I ate first??! The grandma chocolate cake! I noticed that the people who ate there ordered the cake. So  mine as well try it. It was so delish!! I got the vanilla and pineapple ice cream (on a separate container). The cake was so moist and it goes with the vanilla and pineapple ice cream. For the entrees I ordered katsu & sticky chicken with macaroni salad it was ok. I was digging more onto my boyfriend's plate, he had teriyaki beef and kalua pork with hawaiian salad."}
{"text":"Every first Friday of the month Moki's has an amazing Hawaiian spread of various salads, meats, starches, and dessert. All for $12! The buffet is from 6-8 P.M. and if you sit outside they will give you a taste of their traditional Polynesian dance shows + fire spinning they offer for private events/parties. The buffet itself is also an example of what their catering services can provide for any event. 

The buffet was well laid-out and consisted of all three salads on the menu (Spinach, mac, and Hawaiian), white and brown rice, katsu chicken, teriyaki chicken, kalbi short rib, kalua pork, chop suey/garlicky rice noodles, tropical fruit (Fresh mango, pineapple, and papaya) and grandma macadamia chocolate cake. Quite a lot to choose from! My favorites of the buffet were the katsu chicken and the kalua pork. Other foods such as the kalbi, had great bbq'd flavor but were a little chewy for me.

The show was spectacular as we watched the talented dancers perform some traditional Polynesian numbers, with the amazing MC showing off his fire eating and fire spinning skills. Although it was freezing outside the dancers performed with ease and grace, and the fire spinning provided some welcome temporary warmth. :)

I was definitely stuffed after 2 rounds of buffet plus the cake and the show was a unique aspect of the dinner which was much appreciated, especially since it was essentially a free performance included with our dinner. Overall everyone had a great time and we'll be back for more buffet and regular Hawaiian foods from Moki's!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely awful.  

When I entered this restaurant I noticed the temperature on one thermostat said 85 degrees and the 2nd thermostat said 90 degrees.  I wish this was the only problem with the restaurant but I was about to be even more disgusted.  I ordered the grilled salmon while another person in my party ordered a chicken dish.  After waiting about 10 minutes, they served us our dishes.  The salmon tasted absolutely awful.  It was very bland and looked even worse.  I asked the cashier if the salmon was frozen in which she admitted it was frozen and they thaw it before cooking it.  It tasted absolutely awful.  The cashier later refunded my order.  It went from bad to worse.  The chicken was hard as a rock.  It was absolutely disgusting.  It was very difficult dry and almost impossible to cut with a fork. 
I can tell the chef was very unhappy with my comments because I overheard him refer to me as \"piece of shit.\"   The chef actually followed me out to my car and was disgusted with my comments.  I told him the chicken was dry and awful.  He responded by saying \"I wish you ate somewhere else\" followed by \"please do not come back.\" 
I later contacted the store in Utah to discuss my complaints with the restaurant.  I told the owner this store has some great potential but if you are going to serve that \"garbage\" then save yourself some time and put a \"out of business\" sign on the door.  He greatly appreciated my feedback and offered a gift card to me and my family.  I responded, I do not want to eat that shit again which he said he will be looking into the problem first thing the next morning.  
Overall, I would not feed the food here to my dog.  It was just disgusting. 

The only thing that is good about this restaurant is that there is a Jack in the Box in the same parking lot so you can grab something to eat after this restaurant lets you down."}
{"text":"Didn't feel welcome due to employees staring at me from the kitchen, all teenagers.  My first instinct was to leave because I was the only customer there although it was 2:00 so not really lunch rush.  The girl working the register was really nice though so I ordered teriyaki beef.  
It came out really quick and the beef tasted fine except it was really fatty, I had to cut alot of it off.  Flavor was good, although I should've asked for more teriyaki sauce.  I don't like salad so they gave me double rice which was nice.  I didn't hate it but I probably won't be going back :("}
{"text":"My husband took me here when we first met in 2005.. Love there food & my husband is best friends with owner. 
I love there teriyaki chicken & teriyaki beef!! Chicken Katsu is the bomb to!!
Everything there is Yummy!! 
I love the store & atmosphere is has! 
Great people too!!! 
I always had my catered from them too when I do birthday parties off my kids! 
I even go to the Mokis that in Salt Lake Ut. It's ran by the owner!"}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this place, food is so good! Could never do Ono again after this place. Reminds me of the spots in Oahu, almost better though!"}
{"text":"I'm from Kaneohe so when my husband found this place, we decided to give it a try. Here's a couple of things I can say about this place. The good things about it: friendly service, nice atmosphere & decor. There are some issues we notice right away however. We came in with a Groupon, and were restricted to certain parts of the menu due to this. As others have previously mentioned, the portions were very small for the price we were paying. The teriyaki chicken was not very teriyaki and was dry as it came with no teriyaki dressing, the rice was dry and seemed to be a larger grain than it ought to be for this type of meal, and the kalua pork was very mushy and wet, and came with a large strip of fatty connective tissue laid over the top. Typically, kalua can be served over rice and cabbage, but ours seemed like it was some sort of sauerkraut. We heard a microwave ding before a meat dish was brought out, which was also a little disconcerting. I paid $21 for two, two-meat dishes, and the portions were very small. I had high hopes for this place, but there are too many things out of whack in my opinion. We had planned on trying the dessert/smoothie menu, but there were many things that had been crossed out. The whole experience was a little disappointing, but I'm glad I tried it to find out for myself."}
{"text":"I have seen this place several times and I really enjoy Hawaiian food, but I was thoroughly unimpressed. I ordered the Ohana plate. Teriyaki chicken, Mahi Mahi and coconut shrimp. The flavor was pretty decent across the board, but everything was really dry, and they really don't have a very good selection of sauces to choose from. The shrimp seemed like it had come out of the freezer aisle at your local grocery store, no pop just breaded with the slightest hint of coconut. The white rice was probably the best part, and that's just it unflavored white rice, and the macaroni salad with all of its ingredients just fell flat. The service was pretty typical nothing to complain about there. It does have a lot of the cliché decor, surfboards and such. 

Overall I have had worse, but definitely do not see myself returning, quite disappointing as its about 2 minutes from my home."}
{"text":"There's a decent amout of Hawaiian food options to choose from in the valley, but Moki's is my personal favorite.  They used to have a second location, but it closed, which sucks because it was right by my house, bigger, and more decorative.  This location is still good, but doesn't have the same atmosphere.  Luckily, the food is just the same and still really good.  
I am a creature of habit, and therefore have only ever tried the chicken katsu, brown rice and Hawaiian salad, but there's a reason I never try anything new here.  They taste really good!  And, the thing that gets me to drive all the way to this Moki's instead of going to Aloha Kitchen, which is basically down the street from my house, is that they use white meat for their katsu, which is not the case at AK or Ono's.  I am not a dark meat fan, so this is a big deal to me.  
The food takes a little bit to come out, but that's because it seems to be made to order, so I don't mind a few extra minutes.  If you're in the mood for dessert, the grandma's chocolate cake is really rich and delicious.  And, if you are looking for some fun Hawaiian culture, go in on one of the Friday nights that they have a luau."}
{"text":"Used to be great food overcooked now at least on beef and chicken and my beef tasted like beef jerkey. It's been in the last year this place has really tanked I think I am done but I am hopeful that the owners read this and make changes."}
{"text":"If you're on the hunt for Hawaiian food this place will do the job. However, I do think that the food misses the mark in a lot of places here. I ordered the teriyaki chicken (they were out of chicken katsu at noon) and it had almost no sauce on it. Wouldn't be a huge issue if extra sauce didn't cost more! Despite the flavor issue the chicken was cooked well and do you get a fair amount of food for the $9 plate. My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken and it was sub par to say the least. Big plus is the dole whip - just like Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with macaroni salad.

Rice - overcooked
Teriyaki Chicken - cold
Macaroni Salad - dry and flavorless

I can forgive cold chicken and overcooked rice, but messing up macaroni salad is a big no-no for a Hawaiian BBQ place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years. The staff is so nice, and offers great customer service. I ordered the salmon today with all spinach salad and it was delicious! The music and ambiance is great, and you can tell they truly care about satisfying their customers!!"}
{"text":"I've been a long-time customer, but lately the food quality seems to be slipping.  The last two times I've been there, the Sticky Chicken has been beyond dry.  I mean so dry you have to have a drink of water to be able to actually swallow the food.

Hopefully this was just an aberration, but I've heard other people comment that the food is declining.  Hopefully they can turn it around."}
{"text":"My favorite thing is good Hawaiian food and what a find Moki's was. Set back in a shopping plaza we almost missed it.  I got the two meat special. The Kalbi ribs and the sticky chicken which came with your choice of salad ( macaroni or mixed greens with the house dressing), and white or brown rice.  It was delicious. My favorite were the ribs. Just like they made them in Hawaii.  The restaurant really had an island feel with Hawaiian music playing in the background and everyone was greeted with \"Aloha\". Made me so homesick for Maui.  The food was so good I had to compliment the chef.  If you ever get to this part of town try Moki's you won't be disappointed.  I'll be back.."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place I really want to give them another try because the meats have really good flavor had the 2 meat combo chicken,ribs,macsalad&rice but the portions for the price are just not right boy if any thing they fill you with rice as well the staff were impatient with me it was not busy at the time so why rush I don't like that at all I think I will just have to try another go to spot for Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this hawaiian restaurant!  Great, friendly service.  The coconut ice cream shake is amazing."}
{"text":"I happen to go to Hawaii about 1 a year and pretty much what you get at a typical Mix Plate restaurant is what you'll find here.  They are friendly. It is a small place, and brought a big group there once.. that was a mess. But most of the time it's fantastic and consistent."}
{"text":"After recently returning from Oahu and Maui where I indulged on local cuisine I was craving some good (and cheap) Hawaiian BBQ.  Mokis was the perfect place to put all my cravings to rest.  

Prior to visiting Hawaii in March I never knew exactly what \"Island\" or \"Hawaiian\" BBQ was, but now every time I come across any place with a hibiscus flower in the logo I gotta stop and try it out!  Who knew all the way in Arizona, people were doing Hawaiian food, good?!  

Mokis has everything that I ate in Hawaii over 7 days all in one spot, from garlic shrimp, to kalua pork to loco moco, even poke and shave iced!  It was hard to choose just one thing so now I have several reasons to return!  I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken with rice and traditional mac salad, everything was delicious and just what I was craving!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. It was dirty, none of the tables were clean, the food was lukewarm & flavorless and the prices were outrageous! This will be my first and last visit to this place."}
{"text":"Moki's is one of those restaurants that you drive by without noticing it or stopping by to try it out.  However, I saw this restaurant on the Groupon website and decided to give it a try.  My wife recently gave birth to our first child and I thought it would be a great treat for lunch to bring home Hawaiian food since my wife and I have been reminiscing about our trip to Maui last spring.  Immediately upon entering the restaurant, I was warmly welcomed and greeted by staff.  The atmosphere of the restaurant has an authentic Hawaiian feel.  The food was delicious and served in generous portions. My wife had the teriyaki chicken and Kalua pork combo plate with macaroni salad and brown rice.  She was delighted with the tender juicy chicken and flavorful moist pork.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and katsu chicken combo plate, also with brown rice and macaroni salad.  The sweet and sour chicken was lightly breaded and the sauce added a delicate flavor to the chicken.  The katsu chicken had a nice crispy brown breading and some pretty awesome dipping sauce.  Overall I was very pleased with this hidden gem and will gladly be a return customer in the future!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So good! Never have had anything here I didn't like! And the staff is always so happy and friendly! Also they have a great coupon on Groupon! Service is always fast and the food always taste freshly made!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was very cute inside!  You definitely get the Aloha spirit.  I was looking forward to having some Hawaiian food, but it was just okay for me.  The portions were pretty small for the price.  I had kalua pork and the chicken.  The pork was the best part.  Mac salad didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  You also get a pineapple slice with your meal.  I like what they are doing, but the food itself could be much better."}
{"text":"Dis is da best Hawaiian food we've had in a long time. A little peice of home in every bite! I had the kalua pork with rice and mac salad! Husband had teri beef and kalua pork. My kiddos had spam musubi. They had large portions. We were able to bring home a plate."}
{"text":"Spent the afternoon with my pops and he suggested we try Moki's Hawaiian Grill.  We each ordered (2) meat combos which came with rice and salad.  We both ordered the Kalbi short ribs and one order of teriyaki chicken and another with chicken katsu.  The short ribs were really chewy and the teriyaki chicken was dry and not the best consistency.  I enjoyed the Chicken Katsu most from the meats we ordered.  The Hawaiian salad was good, wasn't a fan of the macaroni salad.  We paid $20 for both our meals and it was nice we could get a variety. The place was filled up during lunch time but I wasn't really feeling the food, it's was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kalbi short ribs and a Mango smoothie. My BF had the Loco Moco. Mine was sadly all bones, gristle and no meat on it. The rice the was dry and the loco Moco meat was overcooked. The sauce was sickeningly sweet and the 3 young folk working in there who wouldn't have the experience to know better. Finally got my smoothie halfway through my meal after having to ask for it. It was way overpriced at 26.$$$ for a disappointing meal. My boyfriend is a huge fan of Hawaiian fare and he was upset . I had to go home and eat since my meal was meatless and non satisfying."}
{"text":"The groupon is well worth the value. Simple Hawaiian dishes but tasty. Would go again!!"}
{"text":"My family recently moved here from California so we're always on the hunt for good Hawaiian food. Found this spot on Yelp and decided to give them a shot. As soon as we walked in, EVERYONE greeted us with an \"Aloha!\" I felt like we were back in Hawaii again.  I ordered half Kalbi short ribs and half chicken katsu with rice and their Hawaiian salad. My fiance ordered their bbq chicken, sticky chicken, with mac salad. Let's just say, we scarfed those plates so quick, I don't even remember us talking during our meal.  The short ribs were so mouthwatering, the way it fell off the bone was just grilled to perfection. Being the fatty that I am, I love eating off my fiance's plate too and I just HAD to try the sticky chicken.  that too was so delicious, I almost pulled a fat-move by ordering another plate.  That isn't the best part though. I heard a lot about their malasadas so we had to try some. Not only was it just about the best dessert I've had, their Mokisadas (malasadas topped with ice cream and pineapple and strawberries) are thee best malasadas I've had, hands down! So, if you're looking for some good ol' Hawaiian  flavor with that great island atmosphere, Moki's Grill!"}
{"text":"Today I drove from Goodyear to far away Mesa to try out Moki's. I found them while searching for a Hawaiian style caterer for an upcoming social event. I tried out several of their dishes and loved all of them. The presentation of the food is lovely, the service is friendly and the food was tasty. I especially liked the Sticky Chicken and Hawaiian Salad. Even the Macaroni Salad, which I'm not usually keen on, was fresh and tasted homemade. We're going to use them for our event and I'm willing to make the drive again to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Love this place! The spinach salad dressing is amazing and pork with rice is consistently great! Customer service is also nice and everybody is very friendly. Been coming here for years and it's highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was okay nothing special. Since my hubby is Hawaiian I expected something better. I agree with other reviews this place was so dirty. Trash over flowing and dirty tables. The lady at the register was yelling at all of the employees, wasn't exactly comfortable to sit and eat."}
{"text":"They have loco moco so that's a plus.

The mac salad gave me bubble guts, so that's a minus.

I gave it a 3 but the bubble guts should probably drive it down to a 2 or a 1, but I'm in a holiday mood.  That being said, I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a someone literally brings Hawaii to Arizona huh? When my friend told me about their \"all you can eat Hawaiian buffet\" for only $12/person, who in the right mind will pass that up?

We arrived at this place at 6pm last night with a party of 6. I was shocked in how pack the place was and disappointed that there wasn't any available seating for us. Then, the cashiers told us that we were better off sitting outside because they would be starting a Polynesian dance show shortly. I was completely confused, paid the money, grabbed the food and found the last big table available. Fortunately for us, that happens to be the table right in front of the show! Two female dancers were absolutely beautiful (I wish so much I could move my hips like that wow!!!) and the guy performer was funny, entertaining and very handsome. 

For food, they have fresh salad, fruits, BBQ ribs, chickens, beef....u name it. The workers pay close attention when the food runs out and would fill it back up over and over. My friends and I were all filled up after the 2nd round but it was still worth it. 

I wish I could upload a short video of the performance and share it with my yelper friends...unfortunately yelp is giving me an upload error over and over again...argh!!!!! Nevertheless, if you enjoy Hawaii as much as I do, come here on every first Friday between 6-8pm...you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The Kailua pork was great... Serving size is great too.  Not a big fan of the Mac salad... The staff was friendly and store was clean... Will go back to try their garlic shrimp."}
