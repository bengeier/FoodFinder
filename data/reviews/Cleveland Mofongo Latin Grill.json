{"text":"The mofongo was so so good! I didn't realize that this place was more of carry-out restaurant than a dine-in restaurant, so I'll probably pick up my food to go next time. But there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Mofongo is great! Had both the roast and fried port (pernil and chicharrones) and was so happy. Juicy, crisp meat, moist flavorful platonos and the salad was simple and good green lettuce. I had the empanadas and they were also delicious but abbot greasy.  (I know many who love their vitamin G, but I wasn't digging it).  Customer service is great. I felt a genuine friendliness and professionalism from staff as they helped us understand empanadillas (what empanadas are actually called...I learned that here)   and take our order.  That energy I got from the employees made me feel like I was on the island (or at an island friend's mom's house). Thank you!! I just moved to CLE and glad I found GOOD Latino food."}
{"text":"Everything is absolutely amazing! The service is great! the owner is so nice always great and it's so close to home... Rincon and campus grille have nothing on the food or service here and it is wayyyyyyyyy cheaper and did I mention how great the service is. Love that they opened so close."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best spanish food in the area. The kitchen is open and you are able to see the food as they prepare it in front of you. If you are looking for good and clean place to eat. I highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice people, nice prices, awesome food! Try the Mofongo, the chicken guava quesadilla, & they have the best pastries I've had in a long time. Awesome Latin/Caribbean food. This is the old Pizza Pan venue, so it's not really a sit down restaurant experience. More like a carry-out type of place. They do have tables, though."}
{"text":"Oh man, I just love rice and beans. Theirs alone make it worth coming to. The pork mofongo was of course so good. We also got basically a chicken empanada (they call it something else). The meats were crispy but juicy. 

You can get delicious sauce and garlic soil on the side for $.25. While not a huge investment, I don't know if these are necessary. The food is soooo good on its own (but I did add hot sauce!). They are def big enough for two people to share. A little oil goes a long way and the delicious sauce was basically like Big Mac sauce."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Puerto Rican food I've had in Cleveland, and I say that as a Puerto Rican!

My wife and I only eat halal meat, so I was pleased to find there were decent vegetarian/pescatarian options, much better than most Puerto Rican restaurants. 

My wife ordered the vegetarian loaded fries, I ordered the Shrimp Mofongo. 

The shrimp mofongo is the best mofongo I've ever had. Period. It was flavorful, juicy, the shrimp was fresh. I can't recommend it enough. My wife's loaded vegetarian fries were great as well, but I wish the serving size was bigger (it usually comes with chicken or beef, so I'm sure the meat options are more filling). 

We also ordered a cheese and guava empanada. It was delicious, filled with sweet white cheese and guava paste. The crust was flaky and crisp, covered with cinnamon sugar. 

Please keep in mind, this place is very casual. So don't expect someone to wait on you hand and foot. The workers will bring you your food if you eat-in, but they're usually busy in the kitchen. We took our food to Edgewater Park. 

Either way, check this place out. Great Puerto Rican food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"So, I am greenga. Yo Budica  en chordison. ( Sorry on my sorry attempted to say \"my heart is Puerto Rican \".).  I love to cook Puerto Rican food. I once severed 80+ at my home for a fundraiser.  I recently had a side of Pernil, with rice and beans. OMG, I am back on PR. Love your food. Buen Provechio."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good Puerto Rican cuisine with a twist.  I was a little skeptical because I have been to a few Puerto Rican restaurants in Cleveland and was disappointed. Cleveland Mofongo is a new favorite place of mine. I recommend the Mofongo with camarones, Vanessa's fried pastele with the house pique or even the baked chicken with rice and beans. I was extremely impressed by the service here, everyone was super friendly."}
{"text":"Good affordable Puerto Rican food! Freshly made too. More of a fast food type place, not lots of seating but the tables are kept clean. Enjoyed real coco rico too :)"}
{"text":"This food is bomb. I order mofongo , salad with pork and a side of rice. 

I got a Malta LIGHT biggest mistake. Should've just let myself have those extra calories  it's all good lol"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I check out a new place I like to get a couple different dishes so that I can really get a taste of their offerings. Then I just spend several days munching on the goods and thinking over my experience before I write a review. There are just so many places to check out in NEO that it might be a long time before I make a second trip, if I even go back at all. 

Well for Cleveland Mofongo I will definitely go back! I stopped in on a Saturday right when they opened at noon. The staff was super friendly and helpful when it came time to explain Puerto Rican food to a basic white girl. Shortly after I placed my order several customers came in and a line started to form. People like this food! Even a cop came in to pick up lunch while on duty. 

*Roasted Pork Shoulder with Yellow Rice and Pinto Beans $9 - Large portions! I liked that the pulled pork stayed mostly moist even when reheated. The food in this dish is pretty standard, and a little salty, but if you split it up and add it to other dishes it's A-Okay!
*Loaded Plantain Chips with Shredded Chicken $9 - This was my favorite. The plantain chips have a lovely crunch on the outside edges and they brush this tasty garlic oil over them. Next is a ton of juicy shredded chicken and a pile of cheese. Don't forget to ask for a side of their special sauce to dip the chips in! 
*Guava Chicken Quesadilla $7.50 - This was pretty tasty as well with a slight hint of sweetness. When I reheated it in the oven the tortilla had a wonderful crispness to it. Comes with pica de gallo and a special sour cream.
*Beef Empanadillas $2.50 - Large sized, and while I was not that big of a fan of the fried shell, the beef mixture inside was flavorful. 

The food here is good, the portions large enough to share or bust your gut with, and the prices are affordable. With all of that said, I can see where some people really love this food and others (looking at you DT from Cleveland Scene) think the food is a bit tame. Take pancakes for example, sometimes you're totally okay with a plain buttermilk pancake with some local butter and maple syrup. Other days you want that pancake to have blueberries and lemon zest in it with a little whipped goat cheese spread and crystallized cinnamon sprinkled on top. 

What I'm saying is that you should give this place a try! You might like the comfort food they serve as is, or you might want to enhance it with more sauces, more green olives, more pico de gallo or more spice in general. I think that Cleveland Mofongo is a great starting point if you've never had Puerto Rican food before, and they are just a small mostly take-out joint with a limited menu, but I know this type of cuisine has a lot of influences (Taino, Spanish, African, American, etc) and is capable of some great flavorful fusion in their dishes so I am eagerly looking forward to this business growing and expanding their menu (give me the comfort and the unique!). Maybe even put some dessert options on there!"}
{"text":"Wow! Drove 50 minutes to give this place a try and I'll drive it again! It was 87 degrees outside and I think it was about 110 inside! We decided to order our food to go and take it to the park- plenty of them in a Lakewood. 

The young woman that took our order was enthusiastic and helpful. She gave us a quick rundown of the menu and gave us suggestions. We ordered two entrees- one with pork and the other with shrimp. Both were very good. My son ordered a Cuban and loved it, along with their fries. Their dad had the fried pork Monfongo and also loved it. It definitely didn't come with a salad like all of the photos show, but it's ok. We ordered plantains which were delicious! 

We had tons of food left over because their portions are huge! Our bill was $48 and included three bottles of the Mexican soda and two cans of soda. Great, great deal if I must say. 

While we waited outside for our order, another patron said they were expanding to add a bigger eating area. Good news! 

We will return!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Not alot of seating so best for takeout.I'm not Latino so I didn't know what a few of the items on the menu were.  The man taking the order explained everything to me with no eye rolling. Been back twice. Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the last 10 days. So far, tried Puerto Rican beef stew mofongo,
Pork mofongo, the mofongo wrap and the tostones. Everything is delicious and cheap!

I also tried the guava limbre (almost like an Italian ice) for $1!

NB:  space is designed for take out. It's super hot and there's only 1 table."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying THANK YOU for being so close to my house. I had you all for the first time yesterday, and you were so amazing I had to order again today. I've referred every person who'll hear me out about this place. Your empanadas are the best I've had in my entire life. The cilantro you pack into the chicken ones are genius. I'm excited to try your Nutella/marshmallow ones. You've been sold out 2 days in a row which means they are obviously fire. Veggie quesadilla is baller and your rice is so flavorful. Will be back Friday for my day off munchies !!!"}
{"text":"Seriously this place is awesome. Absolutely delicious. Everything on the menu is flavorful, home-made, legit. 

The place took over a spot that was always failing on the corner of West 117th and Lorain. Multiple failed pizza spots with junky food. Then this place comes along and with the history of this location I was very weary. 

Upon trying it, I was blown away. The empanadillas, quesadilla, roasted chicken, tostones, salads. Everything I have tried so far has been so so good.

It's just a tiny little place but the service is amazing. The people are super nice. It's just awesome and I hope this place makes it.

Fun tip also is to take the Puerto Rican Ices they have in many flavors and mix it with vodka. We always take it next door to Vibe and make awesome mixed drinks with it.  Passion Fruit is the best mixed with some citrus vodka. 

Anyway. 5 Stars. Love it. Gonna hype this place up so much."}
{"text":"Simple yet tasty menu.  The signature menu item is the Mofongo  which is mashed plantains together with garlic, olive oil, pork crackling and choice of meat or vegetable filling.   I had mine with roasted chicken and it came with a simple side salad that really balanced out the dish. Seating is limited, most customers seem to be picking up to go offers."}
{"text":"This place is like being transported to the streets of Miami. While the seating is super small, with only four tables, the menu is delightful. They specialize in Mofongo, but have many other choices for any Latin lover. We had the loaded plantain chips and the roasted pork Mofongo.  Ask for the homemade hot sauce not really spicy but differently good w fresh mint  ... Ah! So gooooood! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Their mofongo is my favorite in the city! The food is always very fresh! The salad on the side is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"The staff was kind, informative  and really took the time to explain their different dishes to us.  Food was fresh, filled with authentic PR flavor.  The kitchen is open which is a big plus.  You actually see the real deal going on, creating dishes that bring you back to the island.
We had the shrimp Mofongo, followed by Tamarindo limber. 
Excellent Service, great affordable dishes.
We will return for Cuban Sandwich real soon."}
{"text":"This is place is amazing, food is so good and the service was very friendly. Right by my house I'm there every week!"}
{"text":"So good!  Go.  Now.  Buen provecho."}
