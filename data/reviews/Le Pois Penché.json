{"text":"Great atmosphere and they have. A nice patio overlooking the street. We had the seafood platter for two and it was quite enough for two.  The only problem was there was a piece of crab that was disgusting - brown, dirty stuff on it so we didn't eat that one.  They should look at that before putting it on someone's plate and wash it clean and don't serve it at all if it doesn't come clean.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This brasserie was exactly what we needed on a cold, damp January Sunday.  Exceptional service, and beautifully appointed.  Special mention goes to the paintings on the wall - very Toulouse-Lautrec; a nice respite from the cliche French advertising posters on the wall at every other brasserie.  We had:  Crab cocktail: Delicious crab, very strong lemon flavour with a creamy base, and a japanese seaweed salad on the base - I would have to say that they were delicious separately but that the seaweed salad detracted from the delicious crab!  Onion soup: I have a wheat allergy and they accommodated us by serving mine sans bread - what a treat.  Eggs Cocotte: What a fun way to eat brunch! Baked egg, chanterelle mushrooms, cheese and herbs - just the right portion size and served piping hot.  Mussels: Beautiful broth, lovely portion.   Drinks: Mimosa and bloody Mary (nice and spicy with lemon wedge and celery stick, rock salt on the edge)  This restaurant is pricey - our brunch for 2 rang in at just over $100.00, but for a last-minute getaway to Montreal, we were pleased."}
{"text":"The service is so bad and I asked for filet mignon medium cooked they brought me medium well and no one even came once to ask if my food is good or if I need papers !! I won't come back cuz the taste is just normal  and at the end they try to buy me with like 27 !! Keep the money learn to serve better !! Apologize worth more than giving 27$  off !!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal here.  We went here on a Sunday night. We had made reservations for 7:45 but the place was pretty empty so they were likely not necessary. The restaurant filled up more as the evening went on. We sat outside, which allowed us to enjoy the summer night and people watch while we waited.  We ordered the burrata appetizer at the recommendation of the waiter. He said that the duck my husband had ordered would take 20 minutes or so to make, so we should get an appetizer, and that the burrata was amazing. He was right, it was amazing. However, it also took 20 minutes to come, and then our meals were another 20 minutes, so it didn't really speed things up at all.  My husband liked his duck quite a lot. I got the halibut with vanilla butter sauce, which was completely delicious. It also came with fresh vegetables on the side, which were quite good.  I can't comment on the dessert as we were lured away by the chocolatier across the street.  Overall, the experience was a slow one, but we didn't mind since it was kind of a date  night. The food was delicious and the service, though slow, was friendly."}
{"text":"I gave the three stars for the location and the decor, the food is an over priced mediocre at its best and definitely not worth the price tag, not the place for foodies but maybe some champagne and oysters on the bar would be a safe bet"}
{"text":"I don't usually post on Yelp, but this one, I had to.  My girlfriends and I were visiting Montreal and we were recommended to go to this restaurant. Surely enough, the food was great, but the service was quite poor. Once we got there, it took the waiter 20 mins to take our order. Since we were almost abandoned in the restaurant, we were trying to get the waiter's attention to order our food. But not once, the waiter was able to acknowledge our presence. Thankfully enough, the manager came by and he was able to take care of our table. Then for another an hour and half, we were waiting for our food. One of my friends steak came out cold and it had unpleasant after taste. (I suspect that her steak got cold while it was waiting for other food to come). Again, during that time period, the waiter did not check on our table not even once.    Finally, when he came by, we stressed that we have been waiting for a quite a long time and still haven't got our food. The waiter did not seem concerned and he simply said \"I will go and check.\" When he came back, he informed us that our order did not go in properly and they are going to make it right away. If he were to be little bit apologetic, I wouldn't have been so upset about my Le Pois experience. The waiter did not seem to care much and he just shrugged and made it sound like it's very common for them to experience that.At that point, we were seriously considering leaving the restaurant and we thought it was quite rude how he addressed the situation. Then the manager came by again and handled the situation professionally. He apologized to us and offered to cover the table. Right after that, I think it took us about 5 mins to get our food. So we waited an hour and a half for a food that could have been made within 5 mins.   I have to admit that, the food was quite good. Other than the cold steak, all other foods (we ordered farmer breakfast, home made waffle and home smoked salmon) were great. I really hope that this experience was the one of the \"exceptions\"."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! Went for brunch on a Saturday morning. The resto is large but had a warm, cosy ambiance. We found the service just excellent.  Jean Sebastian was very friendly and informative. He had great energy and the food was superb. They smoke their own bacon. Outstanding. House made jams also delicious!"}
{"text":"Montréal à table a bien débuté au Pois Penché sur le boulevard de Maisonneuve, centre ville. Une découverte de bons plats et de service à la bonne hauteur, entre brasserie parisienne et fin resto. Le potage à la citrouille, est une merveille. Les bettes au pieds de vent, avait plus tôt les pieds devant...des copeaux de parmesan aurait suffit. La joue de boeuf a fait l'unanimité. Une belle viande bien avec ses jus, servie en belle et bonne portion.  Comme à Paris, sinon mieux, le service aimable par des Français bien élevés...vraiment comme on l'aurait souhaité! ...convivial et jamais déplacé. Le gâteau au fromage...le  brownie...bon, sans plus. Un peu cher pour une promo de restauration. Nos amis désirent y retourner et c'est une bonne idée! Bravo, Montréal à table"}
{"text":"OK. SO, there are some very good things about this place. The appetizers are extraordinary, and some of the meat dishes are good too. it's not a great value (a bit pricey, considering), but the service just isn't great. I know that this has been mentioned on Yelp before, but it's an issue- at least for this American.   Our waiter was REALLY nice. He was thoughtful and made great suggestions. And the ceviche appetizer is really, really great. You must have it.   But he and the other lone server in this fairly large restaurant were simply too busy to be available when you needed them (for a new drink, or the bill, or whatever). IN the end one does notice these things. This is what takes this place form a 4 star to a 3 star review, in my book.   So, specifically, the food is like this: Oysters were great (not cheap, but great. On the other hand, they're pretty hard to screw up!). The ceviche appetizer is so glorious I don't know what to say. It should be a main dish. Light, delicate, and just spicy enough. Just awesome. The Steak Frites on the other hand (how can one screw this up?!?) was a poor cut, and not at all tender. Go ahead and use a flank steak for God's sake. It's easy!  Anyway, my date's filet was much better. In the end, It's a bit expensive and the food varies wildly, and the service is simply a mixed bag. I'd like to give this place a better review, but that's the deal, my friends!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a fantastic place to have fresh oysters and a trusting beef tartar for a nice romantic dinner. Fancy, 20's style chic fun; check out the art downstairs when you go to the washroom ;) FYI I'm Seth D. 'sugarplum' if you read a few reviews down - come on don't make fun, you have nicknames for each other, don't lie!"}
{"text":"Unexperienced staff, slow service, found small hair in the plate, no excuses from the manager, which was the least we could have gotten, overpriced.  We got the smoothie 20 min after finishing our plates.  I understand why on sundays its half empty. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Since we live part of the year in a condo close to Pois Penche, we decided to go back and give it another chance. Things have changed a bit; hostesses with tight dresses and high heels now greet you. The music is no longer french music, but loud rap. The food is still overpriced but now they give you smaller portions. My bavette was a small piece of very tough meat I had to struggle to cut. The french fries are still anything but french, but that's not a change; it's been that way since the start. Oh well, this restaurant could be so much more, given its location and setting!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Seasonable price for brunch. A little bit towards tourist. Not sure I will go there for dinner."}
{"text":"We got to Montreal after 3.5 hour drive on Wednesday, we were hot, tired and needed seafood. Concierge at the Omni recommended le Pois Penche. WOW it was excellent. All in our party were impressed. The cold pea soup (petit pois droid) and oysters were the best. Excellent service, beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Our experience at Le Pois Penché was far from being bad. However, we just didn't feel the \"it\" factor. Even if the food was bland and its presentation was a bit off, the staff was nice and the ambience of the restaurant was pleasantly Parisian enough. Will I go back? Probably not for brunch. Montreal is filled with brunch spots in the same price range and the competition is pretty tight. Le Pois Penché has work to do on the mixtures of different flavours and spices and perhaps, a more modern and captivating version of their plate presentations. Read more about our experience on our blog."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for restaurant week and this is definitely not the place you go to if you're looking for a quick bite. Ambiance, and attitude of staff definitely promote for diners to relax and go at your own pace. In fact, neighbouring diners were seated shortly after we were, but they were finally ready to order by the time we were done with our 3 courses. Please note that I'm not criticizing the restaurant for this, it is just something to be aware of beforehand.  I had the squash soup and risotto and was very happy with both. Not blown away based on the price point though. I would recommend this place for groups looking to gab and eat leisurely, and couples looking for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Not a perfect French food, great win list but too intent to look at. I had prime sea food soup"}
{"text":"We thought Le Pois Penche was better than the 3 star rating it currently has on Yelp. Generally, we skip anything with less than 3.5 stars, figuring that 3.5 usually means a decent but not outstanding meal. But, our hotel had recommended it (but didn't make our reservation), and it was close by. We had mussels (delish, all opened except one), a tomato and caramelized onion tart on puff pastry with a soft cheese (also delish), the penche salad (fresh, but could have used more dressing, and I usually go very easy on the dressing), and the fresh sardines (also excellent). The bread tasted freshly baked and was warm and great for dipping in the sauce from the mussels. A few quibbles: these were all appetizers (we didn't order mains), and they brought them all out at once. They actually barely fit on the table. So, timing, folks. Just ask us, or pace things a bit. And, the wine list was seriously overpriced -- I think the cheapest glass was $12, for pinot gris, and $14 for the next least expensive. Guys, you'd sell more wine if it was slightly cheaper. Overall, a 3.5 and *nearly* 4-yelp-star experience."}
{"text":"Went here based on a recommendation, but I found the experience absolutely mediocre.  I didn't complete my entree or salad as I thought both were bland.  No need for me to return."}
{"text":"Snob, cher, peu copieux (voir la photo) trop guindé et peu de choix pour un brunch."}
{"text":"I went there for an IPO presentation.  Really good service  Tartare de salmon was amazing . I underestimated it haha  The steak was medium, a little fatty on the top  I love meat  Really pleasant to drink in their original cups  Had a great time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Looks kinda like a french restaurant and the menu is better than the food. I know that Montreal is expensive but this doesn't stand up to to price paid. I had the Plate D'hote which was blue marlin described as grilled with a cool center. It was overcooked and pretty tasteless. My wife had a grilled salmon which was just OK. With one glass of wine and no dessert, it was a hundred dollar bill. We didn't stick around for dessert. Service was OK; slow but after all it is a french restaurant. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here by myself and with my husband a few days later. I had a great time here and the servers were extremely helpful. We enjoyed their Oyster special ( a dozen for $20). They had great food and a great atmosphere. I had a glass of Chardonnay there that I can't find anywhere else, but it was amazing."}
{"text":"Oh man. Inhaled a dozen oysters in 15 minutes. Would've had seconds if I didn't have dinner plans.  Splurge without breaking the bank: $20 for dz oysters, 5-8 pm on weeknights.   On weekends...that can easily go up 2x. The waiter actually forgot it was Saturday (I'd asked him if I missed \"oyster happy hour\" and he said no), so my bill reflected the normal cost - ouch. But he adjusted it to the HH price. Nice!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid. I've been there twice, the first time I would have given it 5-stars, the second time was more like 3.5 or maybe a 4, so for now I'm splitting the difference at 4-stars. Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good that second visit, but didn't have the \"wow\" factor experienced the first time. Service was very good both times."}
{"text":"Great bar, great food. 1st night in Montreal we pulled up to the bar and had a great meal. The wine list is off the charts.  If you like food and atmosphere you'll like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is very good and friendly.  Ambiance is relaxed cool and warm. I notified the Waiter that  my glass of wine was too warm  He friendly accepted to change it with a cooler glass which I really appreciated. Tartares were very fresh, chunky and tasty. Interesting wine list. Yummy, fresh oysters for 20$ a dz. as appetizer!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered Le Pois Penche while touring in Montreal because it was near our hotel.  Even though the meal was a bit expensive, we benefited from a positive currency exchange rate.  The restaurant is conveniently located on a corner near the art museum. The service was attentive and courteous.  It was a bit strange that, about 3/4 of the way through our meal, our server told us that his shift had ended.  However, the new server stepped right in without missing anything. The wine list is extensive.  The sommelier suggested a good Sauvignon Blanc from the inexpensive part of the list- about $70 CA.  The least expensive wine bottle was $60. The cheese plate we had as our appetizer had three, large servings of different types of fromage.  All were delicious. I had a veal T-bone, which was perfectly cooked.  It came with green beans.  Unlike the perception of stingy French dishes, this dish was more than enough to eat. This is a great restaurant to enjoy a Montreal fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night. I noticed another review that said service on a Monday was slow, they were right. The food was really good, but for the price I'd expect a lot better service. Several times we lost our server and had to fend for ourselves. I was with my parents who ordered the halibut. It looked great and they enjoyed it. Good to know they have good fish on a Monday. Typically I wouldn't order it after the weekend."}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food, it's about the service. The food is fine, nothing spectacular, but the service is FIVE STARS. It's been a while since I felt so taken care of by restaurant staff.   I came with two friends and we did the prix fix dinner for $25/person, and we wanted to share a bottle of wine. We all have different tastes and our waitress was amazing. Not only did she know the extensive wine list inside and out, she also brought the sommelier on board to help us find a bottle everyone would be happy with. The wine was EXCELLENT and honestly, it humbles me to say the whole experience was made by the wait staff at this spot."}
{"text":"We were really pleased with our dinner! Sat at the bar and were super entertained. Loved our food (lobster, steak tartare, steak). Loved our wine. Loved our grapefruit, gin, cava slushes for dessert. I would return."}
{"text":"My review in one word? Disappointed.  I've heard about this place for years and years.  So many people have told me that I HAVE to try this restaurant out etc etc..So, last week, I finally went in with my fiance, and man was I unimpressed.  Let's start with the pros: 1. Clean  2. Nice ambiance and decor 3. Knowledgable and courteous staff  Cons: 1. It took FOREVER and a day for our food to come...mind you, this was a Monday evening and there weren't many people, so I'm not sure why this was the case..... 2. The food was bland. Seeing as to how seafood seemed to be their specialty, I was extremely excited about my salmon tartare, and the house fries which we were told were nothing short of amazing. My tartare literally had no taste...I've made better in my own kitchen. And the fries were not really good.... I thought that maybe my fiances lamb would be good because it looked phenomenal, but again, no taste...... 3. Semi pricey for no reason...  So I was and am very disappointed, and will definitely not be back. I'm still not sure what all the hype is about! Maybe it's their seafood platters that are amazing??  Meh...."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on accident on a Friday night. One of the best foie gras I've had and amazing entrees (we got the steak and salmon). The drinks were strong and everything was amazing for the price! Would HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"This place has a great feel with the French flare. I can only say positive things about the food. I went there with a group of 9, everyone was impressed with their choices. But when it comes to service...all I can say is it's also rather francaise.  The waiters were horrible when it came to requests and being timely. The table ordered a seafood platter to share, so ALL the seafood cutlery came out and was placed on the bread plate (without asking who is actually having it...). When the other appetizers started coming out, they ran out of space on the table... so made the decision to remove the bread plates. They just went around the table yanking away the plates leaving the cutlery to scatter all over and making SO much noise. And we were left with no bread plate!!   I even had to ask 3x for herbal tea!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best caesar cocktail in town. All other things on the menu are good but overpriced. For the best experience at Le Pois Penché sit at the bar have an entree and order the caesar, this will not disappoint or break the bank."}
{"text":"Came here for a conference so we had a set menu. Their salmon was very soft and tender. The creme brulee was very well made. Can't really judge the service, as it was for a conference. However, the place is very nice and the ambiance was great."}
{"text":"This was our final stop on our trip to Montreal this summer, and it did not disappoint. I'm surprised actually that its rating is so low, because my experience was great, despite the obnoxious man near us at the end complaining loudly to the manager.  The interior of Le Pois Penche is a lot of fun. The bar is pretty, there is some great artwork, and a huge chandelier in the front overlooking a circular staircase that winds its way down to the bathrooms. It's simple, but upscale, and inviting.   The location is great, right on the corner of Rue Drummond and Boulevard de Maisonnueve. I'm sure sitting outside you would get some of the noise of the street, but the nice part about being inside is that it is pretty open, and the doors to the patio are all opened when the weather is nice, so it feels comfortable.  I had the steak, but it was my soup that was divine. I believe it was a chilled tomato soup, and eating it was so blissful. Perfectly scrumptious.   Oh and for dessert I had an ice cream sandwich made with warmed cookies. Ahhhh, so tasty :)  Our waiter was great, and attentive, and I had no complaints. My only thing is that it is a bit steep in price. This is definitely a nice place to eat at, and your bill will indicate as much."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with Le Pois Penece' and will consider going back. It is perhaps a little pricey but the food was really stellar. I had the salad with the fried goat cheese as my appetizer and that was quite good. The main course though was a Rib Steak for two in a red wine reduction with chanterelle mushrooms and fois gras.  It would have been better if the steak was shared with my hot date and not my friend Alex. The lamb dish was very tempting and there were fish courses that also tempted me but then I saw the fois gras and the steak and that was my decision. Wine list was very good. There are some less expensive bottles and then there are some very expensive one. This place should not be rushed. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dinners for the money I have ever experienced. The $300 tab was overpriced beyond belief. Ripoff! Never again"}
{"text":"Croque Madame was excellent! The ham wasn't crazy salty like most places and Eric our server was on point and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Everything I ordered was bad and it was really expensive. The Latte I ordered was cold and she ended up microwaving it instead of making me a new one. The Tar Tar was gross. Eek! Methinks not."}
{"text":"We came for Christmas Dinner at 6:00pm. We had reservations for a month prior and called the morning of the dinner to confirm. The restaurant wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately. Our waitress brought the menus, explained what was not in the menu, and we waited. We ordered a starter to share for the table whilst we looked at the menu to decide. The waitress seemed in a hurry to take our order and didn't want to take a drink order without a food order as well. She wanted to clear the menus away, she said. We ordered the drinks and the rest of the food.  We waited. The table starter came. It was a delicious bone marrow with escargots, delicious gravy and morels. As soon as that was cleared they brought our main course. They realized their mistake, took them away and then brought our starters about a half hour later. We couldn't catch our waiters eye at all. We needed cutlery, we wanted wine. We waited. The food was quite delicious, a steak tartare with truffle and Parmesan, a couple of onion soups. We waited. I told our waitress that we felt abandoned, we had been in the restaurant for over an hour and had t been able to catch her attention to order wine. She said that she was swamped and she needed to give us to another waiter. We got out wine f I'm him, but he did t seem to care. He opened the bottle, smelled it, poured two glasses and walked away. We complained to the manager about the wait. TWO HOURS after we walked in we were served output main course. It wasn't exactly what we ordered, we had to send some back to get heated. We were happy to leave and probably will not go back. Yes it was a holiday, but if they couldn't handle the numbers they should have either had more wait staff or not taken as many reservations. There are many other places to go. We enjoyed dessert and coffee with an after dinner drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nope - not a place to recommend at all. The food is whatever, half the menu is not available,it is freezing inside and the manager is barely pleasant. A definite pass"}
{"text":"I came here with 4 other girls for a bachelorette dinner. The décor and ambiance was French Modern with class and loved the big comfy red couches. Our waiter was attentive and responsive. Price was reasonable and many items on menu to choose from.   I order the Cuisse de Canard (Duck Leg Confit) for $26 and 6 dozens of raw oysters for $22 from Nova Scotia. I loved the oysters but you can't mess that up, all you have to do is shuck them but reasonably price for restaurant. My duck leg was cooked to perfection as the meat was falling off the bone however the bed of fingerling potatoes sautéed with smoked duck, mustard sauce and mache lettuce was too salty. I understand French cuisine is salty but it was extremely salty to the point that I drank tonnes of water and a nasty salty after taste. I tried hard to finish my meal but I couldn't finish it...now I know why French people are so thin.  In addition, my girlfriends ordered: -  Ris de Veau et Homard (Lobster and Sweetbread) for $38 with Sichuan peppercorn sauce, armillary and kale, parsnip puree, sriracha cashews was okay but not something worth mentioning.  - \"Stavros\" Cut 1kg USDA Prime Rib steak, foie gras and morel sauce, enoki and truffle shavings (for 2 persons) for $110 was a portion that is enough to feed 3 instead of 2. The sauce they used was salty and steak was overcooked due to sauce. We requested medium rare which came out medium to cook.  They have a nice side patio and private room downstairs by the bathroom that is really private (separated by glass wall and door) A nice squared 360 degree bar central of the restaurant. We decided this restaurant do to French Cuisine and read reviews on Yelp to find a nice decent restaurant from walking distance of our hotel. Otherwise, I've had better French Cuisine in Toronto and Old Quebec City."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My favorite seafood Resturant in Montreal. I would like to add that the Oysters are a MUST!"}
{"text":"Walked off the street to get out of the cold and ended up here. The server was really cool, he was from France and recommended the wine to go with the salmon I got. We had an amusing discussion on some Montreal related cultures...The food was great! Had their escargot, and no, it doesn't taste like chicken. The salmon was well portioned, in other words, don't expect a large portion for those of you who are from NY/NJ. If they didn't have the bar and TVs, I would think that this would be a great place to bring a date since they don't rush you to leave or anything like that. Yeah, it's pricy but I'd come and visit again."}
{"text":"Great location, but otherwise a waste of money and time.  Their \"signature\" scallop ceviche was so salty, it was not palatable.  Their over priced shrimp cocktail had small shrimp that were not even deveined.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and will return for dinner, thus 4 stars. It is your typical french restaurant with great food and horrible host. Of course if you like that, and expect it this is where you come. He commented something to us in French, and I half caught what he was saying my coworker didn't and as I began to reply in French he spoke to us in English, \"I am sorry, I could not resist myself, I love the deer in the headlights look I get from people who don't speak French.\" We laughed it off, as hey....he is French...of course he is going to be weird.  Order the Tartar and the soup, wonderful choice and the wine list looked great, even tho we didn't order from it. I will give it 5 stars if the duck is as awesome as his attitude is French. To be continued."}
{"text":"I had brunch there on a Sunday afternoon. The service was impeccable, as was the shakshuka. I forgot a pair of very expensive sunglasses on the seat and only realized it about a week later. I called, thinking that the chances of getting my sunglasses back were slim to none. I was so touched when they told me they had my sunglasses. There was a note taped to them with the date, time and where I was seated. Who does that these days! Mega point for their honesty. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent location downtown, relaxed ambiance, sidewalk seats are good for people watching (or being watched).    Food is fairly good, but not *wow* great, here is a breakdown: -- beef tarter is fresh and delicately seasoned, a bit too chunky for my preference but a good tarter nonetheless -- salmon tartar's more interesting character is its texture, with addition of wakame and fish roes -- duck leg confit wasn't memorable, the striped bass fillet tasted fine but it was served on a bed of quinoa that sank to the bottom of a large pool of melted butter.  As much as I  enjoy traditional french cuisine and liberal use of butter, this puddle of butter didn't do it for me.    Service was very very slow, even though the place wasn't 100% full.   I'd consider this an okay bistro, definitely not the best that Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"We didn't make a reservation on a Friday night but were seated at the bar while we waited for a table to open up. The bartenders are so friendly and attentive! We started with two glasses of wine - they mainly have bottles so the selection by the glass is limited. I also just loved the very classic French vibe of the entire restaurant that we almost just changed our minds and stayed at the bar for our meal, but just as we were about to order, they told us that our table was ready - which ended up being a great spot next to the windows.  We ordered mussels as an appetizer, which were pretty fresh and had a great soup base. We both ended up getting the duck confit, which came on top of brussel sprouts. The duck was a little dry on the inside and not as flavorful as some of the skin and outer bits, but this was solved by eating it together with some of the more nicely seasoned brussel sprouts and sides that came with it."}
{"text":"Nous avons bien aimé la qualité et fraîcheur des aliments au brunch, le service est excellent, tant à l'accueil qu'à la table. Par contre il manque un peu de choix pour le brunch : 5-6 options seulement. Mais c'est si bon! Ambiance classique, relaxante. Vive les mimosas et le champagne! Nous allons revenir pour le menu du soir."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was pretty decent. The aura is great. It is always busy. I got the burrata appetizer, the filet mignon, creme brulee and profitroles. The appetizer was overpriced for the taste. The main course was fine but nothing extraordinary. The desserts were average as well. All in all, it was an average experience but I would go back for the aura."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été dans le cadre de Montréal à table. Le menu était attirant et nous voulions tester la place depuis longtemps. Je dois dire que les points qui m'ont plu sont: - très bel endroit, grand, spacieux, à la française, chic et bien décoré à l'intérieur - très bon service - très bonne bouffe! Les points à améliorer, selon moi: - le prix de l'alcool (verres de vin entre 14 et 16$ et pinte de bière à partir de 10$) - la quantité dans les assiettes (surtout le plat principal, peu copieux - cf photo) Voilà, donc globalement bien, à essayer tout de meme!"}
{"text":"Just absolutely fantastic service and the food is out of this world. Great atmosphere, outdoor seating and what else would you want to have in downtown Montreal"}
{"text":"I went to Le Pois Penche on my birthday while in Montreal on a work trip. I sat at the bar, and it was fantastic. The wait staff was very nice, even offering suggestions for other places to eat and see around the city.  I had the duck confit and added fries as a side, along with 2 great red wines. The food was delicious, the potatoes and brussel sprouts under the duck were cooked to perfection. The fries were also delicious, suggest adding a side of aoli to the fries. Cannot wait to try again"}
{"text":"The salad, filet mignon and crème brulée were delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped here for brunch after a single night in Montreal. The food was excellent. My wife enjoyed the oysters, and I loved my Lobster Benedict. The service was great as well, but the kitchen was a bit slow for a restaurant that was nowhere near full. If we had been in any kind of a hurry, this could have been a problem."}
{"text":"Came in to escape to cold and snow, was pleasantly surprised at the delicious French onion soup. How can you not love eating at a bar where they give you a separate carafe of OJ for your screwdriver to add to your glass of grey goose? You've got my vote!  Took a quick tour of the wine cellar when I ventured downstairs to the bathroom and noticed a Sammy Sosa pic (as a Chicago girl this is MEGA points in my book!!). Bartender was on point, although we were the only American patrons there but still awesome and drinks were never unattended."}
{"text":"Of course we read all the reviews before going here. This place was very close to our hotel, which had a big part in this decision in going here. Also, like many other restaurants in the area, this place has a beautiful outdoor seating area. We were walking by and she saw someone having mussels. So like a little kid in Toys r's us, we now had to go there for lunch and to try the mussels. This place was much better than expected. Despite the other reviews, we thought the service was really good. As mentioned, the outdoor seating area is really nice. Eating here, it FEELS like you are in Montreal. Other reviews state this place is a bit overpriced; please we're from New York. $18CAD for a Burger - No Problem. Also keep in mind, there are a lot of tourists in the area, Yes; like us, tourists."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place this past Labor Day weekend while visiting from the States. It was wonderful!  The service was a bit slow (hence only 4/5) and it took them about 10 minutes to come to our table. Other than that though, everything was excellent. Their wine list was very extensive, although if you want to order by the glass you're somewhat limited.   Delicious mussels appetizer, I would highly recommend them!  I had the NY steak, ordered MED, came out MR, but it was actually better that way so I didn't mind. BF had the veal, which he said was wonderful. Bit pricey, but we thought it was worth it. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Steak Tartare was very good. Salads were weak. Seafood Platter was very weak. Need to improve."}
{"text":"We both enjoyed our main courses. I had beef cheeks with blueberries (so tender) and my boyfriend had the duck with this awesome fried rice cake on the side.  Service was kinda slow but we were enjoying sitting outside and watching people. I don't like how they have the seats set up outside. They have one row of tables alongside the building, then the sidewalk, then another row of tables along the curb. It makes for awkward service. Never seen any restaurant set up that way and for good reason!"}
{"text":"This is a very classy and romantic restaurant. I made reservations at this restaurant for a special Christmas day dinner. The prices are high but the quality of the food/atmosphere is deserving of it.  We had CEVICHE DE PÉTONCLES ÉPICÉ  for appetizers. The scallops were really fresh and well-flavored with the lime juice. We highly recommend that dish. My girlfriend had SOUPIÈRE DE FRUITS DE MER AU SAFRAN (seafood soup) for her main dish and she enjoyed that as well. Again, the seafood was fresh and the flavors were quite good. I had CUISSE DE CANARD (duck leg). The duck was very well cooked, juicy and tender, though a little bit fatty. The portions are not small so you can expect to have a fulfilling meal.  Our server was incredibly busy while we were there so though she was nice, she was not very attentive.   Overall the experience was what we had expected from a higher-end restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions for dinner. The ambiance isn't so much of a trendy young person kinda place but more of a ... Business casual kinda place.  They also have this super cute retro cash machine at the front of the restaurant... I don't think it's functional, but anyway, let's not dwell on the details.  I've tried their salmon tartar, charcutrie board, as well as the confit de canard before. I know they are known for their oysters but I've never tried it, so I can't comment on that. Of everything I've tried on their menu, I can say that everything was delicious. The confit de canard was probably the best one I've ever had, and I've had it almost every French restaurant I've been to in my adult life. The salmon tartar is pretty good too and it's also available on their late night menu. Yes! They have a late night menu - a set 2 course dinner at a lower cost - because yes, the regular price is a little pricey...  I would go back if only for the duck lol"}
{"text":"If I could select 0 star I would.  First restaurant we hit in Montreal after a long drive so we were hungry and thirsty. We don't speak any French which I didn't think was a big deal.   Attitude immediately from the host or manager. After 30 minutes we didn't even get asked our drink order. The patio had 3-4 tables. Got up and left."}
{"text":"C'est bon. Que ce soit pour bruncher, déjeuner ou dîner on n'est pas déçu côté bouffe. Mais c'est cher!"}
{"text":"Dined at Pois Penche last night and had a great experience.  The hostess greeted us promptly and offered coat check.  Our server was adorable and friendly - at times service was a bit on the slow side, but this seemed to be more because he didn't want to interrupt our party of six.  I was always able to catch his eye and wave him over when we needed something.  For appetizers we had French onion soup (huge serving and excellent), green salad (appropriate size, fresh and tasty), Italian steak tartare (prepared with truffle oil and Parmesan - delicious), the chef's sausage platter (actually more of a cured meat charcuterie - prosciutto, chorizo, mortadella, a Parmesan sausage and a Chardonnay sausage) and the special appetizer of the night - smoked salmon (I did not try this as I am not a fan of smoked salmon, but I was told it was very good).  For entrees, two of us had the special - a bouillabase.  This was delicious - basically an excellent lobster bisque topped with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish.  My husband had the filet mignon and said it was probably the best he had ever had (and we eat a lot of filet).  Other companions had lamb and risotto.  Everyone said their meal was excellent.  For dessert, French apple pie (too thick to be tarte tatin), coffee, espresso, cafe au lait and tea.  The server told me that he likes this apple pie better than his mother's, but he won't tell her that.  Usually served with English cream, but he was more than happy to serve it with vanilla ice cream.  The server was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and wine list. He was able to recommend a red wine that even the non-red drinkers enjoyed.  He explained that some items were not available (bone marrow appetizer) because they were changing to a new menu next week - I wish we were staying in town longer so we could check it out!  All in all, a great time was had by all.  Just don't go if you are in a hurry as dining here is an experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and was very pleased with the service and even more with the food. I don't speak any french, and was uncomfortable at first. My waitress was extremely accommodating and helpful, and spoke English fluently. Presentation was impressive, and although portion looked on the small side, it ended up being more than enough food. Ingredients were fresh and flavors were excellent. Will definitely stop in again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The is definitely a place to stop in when in Montreal.  We were wandering around downtown Montreal looking for a place that you jump out at us.  Le Pois Penche instantly appealed to us with its French decor and outside seating.  The sidewalk seating and people watching were definitely fun, and why not eat French food in Montreal.  The food was delicious and the service great.  The waitress was friendly and gave a very honest opinion of what she liked there.  Nice dressy place.  Oui Oui  Damien."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a pleasant brasserie setting.  We had great, friendly service. The recommended french onion soup was the best I have tasted- lots of cheese, great broth. The mushroom-stuffed chicken rolls were superb, accompanied by delicately seasoned vegetables. The creme brûlée was as also excellent, as was the special brownie. Portions were small and prices moderately high, but the Table d'Hote meal package was only $31 Canadian dollars. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Caution, a very nice spot but definitely NOT 2 $$ (even Canadian). Dinner with a glass of wine will easily run $50 per person.   We sat in a tiny table out on the sidewalk on a summer Sunday evening so it was pretty quiet. As they are in the heart of the business district I imagine it could be a little busy on a weeknight.   Our fish was quite good and other than the prices, not much to complain about."}
{"text":"Great service! Excellent food! Would come back for sure! Love this place! Dessert was especially good!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here to try the MTL a Table brunch menu. One friend and I ordered the smoked salmon plate that came with two poached eggs on a meager slice of toast and a small mound of arugula. The plate was supposed to include avocado, but just a tiny bit was smeared over the plate as a garnish. For the price, I expected better quality or at least quantity, but sadly neither expectation was met. Unfortunately, the mimosas were also weak and overpriced. On the upside, we were content with the small basket of assorted breads and jams we received at the start of the meal, and my friend who ordered the \"farmer's meal\" seemed happy with her choice. The location is pretty convenient as well. However, for the price and quality, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place in Montreal tried last year in summer ( table outside on the walk way are typical Paris style and this time in winter. Ostriches and tartare are the very best things and the good environment with soft music jazz up all the rest. Really suggested"}
{"text":"I was only here for a networking event in the lovely room downstairs so I can't speak to the usual dining experience but in terms of a private event with passed canapes, the food was wildly hit or miss. The tartare was delicious, but the quiches were not cooked - literally runny raw egg. Gah I have the heebie jeebies again just thinking about it.  But I do want to come back and try the ceasars!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on my birthday, my hubby's pick, he knows I enjoy seafood. And this was a right place to go exactly for that. We had seafood tower which combined"}
{"text":"We came here on a sunday night with my family after the grand prix. I ordered the Atlantic salmon which did not disappoint, very simple but delicious. We later ordered the profiteroles as dessert which the breading was great but the ice cream was too frozen and tasted like ice. Overall limited choices in the menu but the food was great nevertheless."}
{"text":"Oh this was so so Good. You talk about great French food, this needs to be on your list. The service was great and everyone I talked to was originally from France. All of the staff was friendly and inviting. I had the shrimp as a starter and they were so fresh it is like they just pulled them out of the water. I had the Duck leg as my meal and it was cooked to perfection and so tender. It came with fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts. It was more then enough to fill you up. I'm telling you, you got to \"Get You Some of That!\""}
{"text":"TOURIST TRAP! beware.. I only ended up here cause it was pretty late and it was the only place in this area that was open and looked semi decent. Prices are high and the food is just ok."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Montreal and Le Pois Penche. We have thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant on both occasions. The location is perfect, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful and the service is good. The staff is very friendly.   The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the steak frites. The fries were not crispy. They were as if they were under a heat lamp after being cooked hours prior. The steak was flavorful and tender. I had the cavetelli with lobster and cream sauce with sliced truffles, also very good. Although, a little light on the sauce for my taste.  We finished with homemade ice cream in 3 flavors. Also very good. We will visit again when we go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Food was good and seemed fresh.  Service was good but I sensed a little attitude here and there.  I think this restaurant is overrated and overpriced for what they offer. I always ask myself: Would I ever come back? The answer in this case is \"no.\""}
{"text":"decent food although really expensive wine list is confusing at first but my waitress explained everything for me (I was 16 at the time) restaurant seemed empty and it was around 7 on a weekend so a bit curious waitress was hot but that was the highlight of the restaurant lmao would not recommend since it is expensive for mediocre food that takes a long time"}
{"text":"We visit Montreal at least once a year, and it's almost always around March, for our anniversary. I'd rather be in this beautiful city when it's not cold as balls, but the sentiment is nice, it's now tradition, and hotels seem to be a bit more affordable during the winter months. This also happens, too, to be around the time of the Montreal en Lumiere festival, which goes through most of February until the beginning of March. This is the second year we just happened to be in the city when this was going on.  Since our first trips up north, we've also gotten a little fancier, and have taken time to find gastronomically interesting restaurants for a nice dinner. We rarely if ever go for all-out nice dinners, so once a year in Montreal is a-okay in our book. However, we didn't realize that the Montreal en Lumiere festival basically screws you over if you want to get reservations at a nice place. (Last time we were up here for the festival, we literally walked a main drag and stopped at a restaurant.) Everyone we called was either booked solid through May or was under renovations until March or was participating in a festival special. Including our hotel, which closed down the restaurant the entire weekend for a $300 per person tasting menu only. Which, and we enjoy nice dinners but, was just a little too rich for our tastes.  Anyway, this isn't a review of our weekend. It's a review of this restaurant. So let's get to it.  Because we thought we were SOL on a nice meal, we went to our concierge, who recommended Le Pois Penche. Granted, a lot of concierges get kickbacks from restaurants, but he assured us it was one of his favorite places around, and they make a mean old fashioned. AND, he was able to score us a table. Sweet! Then we saw the mixed reviews, and were a bit nervous--maybe our concierge DID steer us wrong.  When it was time, we walked on over to the restaurant, which does kind of look like a tourist trap from the outside, though it's not on a super busy touristy street, which is good. We were promptly seated and ordered drinks. This was probably my only complaint of the entire night: We had, literally, four different people coming by to ask questions, serve, or pick up plates. That was a bit strange. But nevertheless, our main server was very attentive.  A few people have mentioned that service is slow. I thought it was at a relaxed pace, and I didn't feel rushed, which is important, and hospitable. On to food!  BEVERAGE I started with the recommended Old Fashioned. It was a good recommendation, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think what set it apart from other OFs I've had is that it was just a tad sweeter than usual. It was very drinkable (dangerous!!), without feeling like I was drinking straight bourbon. Large twists of orange peel also added to a balanced drink. Later on, I got a glass of Sangiovese red, which was another great recommendation to pair with my duck confit.  STARTERS We shared (okay, *I* ate) the Torchon de Foie Gras. Holy god in heaven, this was absolutely delicious. We got a generous cut of foie, served with a wedge of toasted brioche, and a nice spattering of fig and almond jam. We did receive a basket of bread for the table, but we could have used more. it was actually kind of difficult to finish the foie with the bread provided. God it was good. I could totally eat another plate of it right now.....  MAINS I ordered the Duck Leg Confit. I've had duck a few times, and it seems to be a protein that is just incredibly difficult to cook. You have to render the fat properly, and cook it long enough so it's not tough. Not to mention...have you ever had a real turkey leg? They're just not great. But whatever they did to the duck confit, it was cooked perfectly. However, it was served with the skin-on, so I kind of wish it was crispy. I ended up removing the skin, which was fine, and the duck meat was still succulent and flavorful. The roasted potatoes beneath were almost an afterthought. I kind of wish the side stood up a little better to the duck, but overall, this was a very satisfying dish.  My fiancé ordered the Steak Frites...as usual. I sampled his frites. And yes, they were tasty, and I kind of wish I got those with my duck instead of the fingerling potatoes and random leaves of brussels sprouts. He very much enjoyed his steak, though I'm not sure I would have ordered it. For whatever reason it was USDA flank (do they not have delicious steak available up here in Quebec?). I've frankly just seen better quality steak for steak frites for the same price as places such as Les Hailles. Ya know?  DESSERT I got a super delicious Vanilla Bourbon Creme Brulee for dessert. It was beyond tasty. But I just love creme brulees. Fiancé got a dense Brownie Sundae with homemade vanilla ice cream and cracker jacks. Somehow the cracker jacks were bland, but the brownie was awesome, so he was willing to forgive.  In the end, we both really enjoyed our respective meals, and $160 CAD wasn't awful."}
{"text":"This was a nice experience in downtown Montreal.  The restaurant has that modern, euro feel to it and the bar is very inviting.    I had the salmon for dinner and the crabcake appetizer and both were excellent.  The service was good and the wine was tasty.   The sorbet desert was also very delish.   The only drawback was that the doors and windows were open which on most nights would be inviting but it was so warm and muggy it would have been better to use the AC.    I would certainly go back and plan to if in the area.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"3.5  It is OK but I do not find the food as Parisian enough to deserve the name of Parisian bistrot as written on the menu. Some basic meals from real Parisian bistrot are lacking.  Food is good and overall well executed but missing the woah factor, the juiciness and savoury of a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Referred by hotel concierge.  Other suggestion was L'express.  Slow service.  Ordered one salad but got two. Salty duck leg.  Ordered Americano but got charged for cappuccino.  Server forgot fries for mussels.  Bad wifi to look up tourist info.  Had to get another one with different SSID and password.  After mentioning the slowness, I was told both salads will be on the house but charged for one.    Very disappointed with service and taste after its appearance."}
{"text":"We walking in at 4:50pm and were told that it was after 5pm so we had to have the formula 1 dinner menu. I showed her the time on my phone which was 4:50pm and she said it didn't matter.  After ordering it took 45min for the 2 salmon entrees we ordered to come out. They were both undercooked. I sent it back and it came out under cooked again, one was clearly grilled while one may have been baked. I gave them to the manager and told him I no longer wanted the entrees and to remove them from the bill.   Bill was around $77 on the paper, which was correct with the salmon entrees removed. When we gave them our card there was no option for tipping, and it simply displayed a total of $166. We canceled the transaction and that's when we started yelling.  Absolutely terrible. Very slow service, water was rarely refilled. The restaurant was not full. I will never return.  On a side note the bread and butter were very good."}
{"text":"Premier avis en français !  Alors je vais essayer de rester bienveillante, car c'est mon chéri qui m'a emmené là-bas pour la St Valentin ! Malheureusement j'ai été un peu déçue...  Le lieu : 3/5 Très sympa, typique des brasseries françaises : bar ouvert, grandes banquettes... J'ai trouvé le service impeccable : serveurs disponibles et souriants, on récupère nos manteaux au début, on nous sert une corbeille de pain (oui comme en France !), bref, super.  La carte : 2/5 Je peux confirmer que ce n'est pas une carte typique des brasseries parisiennes. Il manque des plats de base.  Ensuite j'ai trouvé les plateaux de fruits de mer hors de prix, ainsi que la carte des vins (mais bon, je dois essayer de m'habituer). On a donc pris du vin au verre, et à 14 dollars le verre, j'ai cru m'étouffer.  J'ai pris un tartare en plat...et bien heureusement qu'il y avait des frites, car je serais restée sur ma faim ! Il était certes très bon, bien assaisonné et relevé, mais je n'ose même pas imaginer si je l'avais pris en plat d'entrée ! Et pour 30 dollars le plat, encore une fois c'est un peu excessif. En dessert, j'ai craqué pour mon dessert préféré, la crème brulée. Encore là, j'ai été un peu déçue...malgré le craquant du caramel sur le dessus, la crème était plutôt lourde et trop \"flan\"  Je pense que cette brasserie est plus adaptée pour les repas d'affaires, où ça en jette d'aller dans une \"brasserie parisienne\" et où l'on a pas peur des notes salées en fin de repas... Pour le typique, on repassera !"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was way too over priced for the lack in quality. I had taken a Uber there and even the Uber driver was telling how bad the place was. I should have listen to him..."}
{"text":"I hate to do this because I wanted to come here for such a long while, having read some fairly decent reviews. This establishment is a bit too pretentious. The servers and host were fumbling about to seat us (though the place was pretty empty). The water glasses were dirty with debris floating in the water, even after replacement. The service was very slow, and our server told us that parts of the menu were 'unavailable' since the kitchen wasn't 'quite ready' (what does that even mean). So we had to settle on just oysters, which took about thirty minutes to be served. Major turn-off, and a substantial waste of time. Two stars for the oysters, but that's it!"}
{"text":"The seafood platter is delicious, a most get when going to the this restaurant. The rest of my meal was not bad for French cuisine, but I've had better."}
{"text":"I haven't been to pois penche in years, and I'm happy to say that it's still an enjoyable place to eat in. It used to have a much more affordable table d'hote, but I suppose the prices have increased everywhere. The soup and salad that came with the main course were huge and tasty. The main courses of the table d'hote were well prepared. The rabbit tasted a lot like chicken. The duck confit was rather plain and so was the pasta dish. The service was really fast, probably because we had an early dinner. I really enjoy the decor in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I heard of this place before and I was hoping it would make the cut. It just did. Food was ok but not *great*, although I'm being severe a tad. My colleagues did enjoy it more than me I think. Location is great, right downtown so it's convenient for business crowds, but I wouldn't bring my wife here. It's a bit gimmicky with the faux French brasserie style, it's clearly aimed at tourists.  All in all it does work but there are far better options in that price bracket. What really turned me off is the wine list. Desperately short and on top of that, we had to change wine choice twice because they were out of stock. Not good. Better list the wines on the chalkboard than on the menu if you're going to manage minute inventories."}
