{"text":"My main problem with the Cornish Pasty Company is inconsistency.  I've had pasties that were simply divine, and I kept going back.  Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances."}
{"text":"I have been to the UK and this version of the pasty is as good as it gets in the Valley. Its a big deal, since its a rather easy cheap thing to make, I mean its UK, right. People there are broke and always telling you. The atmosphere is basically loud white folks drinking and drinking, loud.  If they could do it take out, they would make some more dough, but it is what it is and its good to check out the other goodies."}
{"text":"Food is good and they have a great beer selection. Every waiter/waitress is in skinny jeans and a vintage T-shirt showcasing how original they are. If you can get past that and the below average service it is a good place to get a bite and a pint. Also the seating inside is mostly wicked uncomfortable so have an extra pint."}
{"text":"So good. Just try it, you'll understand. From what I've tried, the Cream Of Leek Soup is the best item on the menu."}
{"text":"There is something to be said about wrapping everything one loves into one little pillow of goodness. I just don't like feeling like I'm in an elevator when I'm not at the bar. Food is very high quality and everything I've ever had is delicious."}
{"text":"Went here with Amanda B. and loved the food. I had a traditional pasty and Amanda gerously offered me a taste of her Mexican flavor inspired pasty. Both had excellent flavors and the pasty pastry bread was so flakey and buttery. Just like ones I used to grab from the local lunch stops in every town around the UK next to a metro station. And yes, the service is slow, but the price, taste and size of the meal all makes up for it."}
{"text":"Awesome concept. The place is a little dark, but it is a nice ambiance to hang out with friends. The food is amazing"}
{"text":"Delicious. Cool, dark, fun, punk atmosphere. Staff are quirky and friendly. I can tell that they enjoy their job. Well priced, and unique experience.  Pastys are 9-15 dollars."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have met Dean about 6 years ago when he was at Casey Moores, yes it is a small world. He is a great guy and he really took the time to learn his mothers way of making the pasty dough. Good for him for bringing a great piece of England to America.   The size of the place makes it just that much more or a neighborhood joint. The beer selection is great, Boningtons on tap! If you have never tried a Boningtons, try one, now!  The Pastys are awesome, the lamb and rosemary is my favorite. The meatball is by room mates. Irish Car Bombs for $3, I've gotten pissed in there ,more then once.   I know that it is a little hot,but we are in the middle of the desert, deal with it.   Thank you dean for bringing a little British to America."}
{"text":"The help was amazing, the food was delicious, they have Anchor Steam beer! I am making this at least a once a week place for lunch."}
{"text":"WOW, to find a pasty restaurant in this part of the country was amazing, as was the quality of the pasty my wife and I had. My wife is a pasty expert since her mother (who has made pasty's all her life) comes from Ontonagon, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is knows as pasty country. We both tried the \"original\" pasty which we both agreed it was true to the original. It was hot, and full of the expected ingredients. In addition to the original the have many other types of pasty's, from Greek, to Mexican, vegetarian, chicken, salmon, to name a few. We would have liked to try some other styles of pasty, and will do so on our next visit to the Tempe area.  In addition to the pasty I did try a cup of one of the soups. The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup was to die for. A bowl of this soup could have been a meal in itself. Beer choices were very good, and they do have a happy hour 3-6 and all day Sunday with $1 off all beers."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! After working 18 hours. Got it to go and it was unbelievable. ...wish i lived here i would definitely go back.... unbelievable flavor and quality..."}
{"text":"Well, my husband and I love this place. No matter what, the patsy is delicious - always made well. We almost always get the shirley temple dessert - treacle tart with the CREAM (not the ice cream! THE CREAM). Good selection of alcohol and lemonade for the people out there who go to a british pub and dont drink. Also, they run out of lemonade a lot. AND they don't have strongbow anymore. Those are my only criticisms."}
{"text":"An awesome place to dine. Been there so many times & never dissatisfied with the quality of the food. At times service is slow. But the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Great place. The pasty's are awesome. I loved the Cajun. Has tons of great pork. There's about 50 so get started. No major complaints worth noting. The world needs more bars/dining places like this. Good stuff"}
{"text":"With out a doubt the best part of an amazing trip to Vegas. Don't let the unassuming front of this place fool you, inside is the nicest staff and some of the best food I've had in a long time. If you're looking for a good quiet place to enjoy some amazing food and good drinks this is your spot."}
{"text":"My buddy from work told me about this place, me being from London, England he knows that I have a love of pies & pasties. I wanted something for lunch so I headed over on my way home from work.  It was 11:00 am  so they would just be opening and it was difficult to find at first so I called them and told them I'm driving round and round in circles and I can't find them. My gps said \" your destination is on the left\" but  all I could see was a burnt out lot.    The girl on the phone was so helpful and she asked me if there were any stores around that she may recognize. I told her \"The Onyx\" adult movie theatre  was behind me  and that an Asian man with Sunburn just ran out of \"The Green Door\" ( the famous green door) wearing only a black speedo and screaming something  down his cell phone.   \" oh I know where you are\" she said all nonchalant as if this was a common occurrence. She asked what car I was driving and then went and stood outside the restaurant and waved me down as I drove up.     The location is strange to say the least. Karaoke Bars,  Philippine evangelical churches, adult movie houses and the infamous Green Door all nestled side by side.   Being the only customer I was still pleasantly surprised with the ambience and gastro pub style decor. This could very well be the place to spend 3 or 4 hours celebrating an occasion or a quick lunch stop. I love the 60's music being played also.   Now the food. I went for the plain no frills Cornish Pastie in order for me to gauge it against the 100's of other Cornish Pasties that I've consumed over a lifetime, including pasties in Cornwall itself.   It met and exceeded all my expectations. It was larger than I expected, the pastry was one of the finest I've ever had almost beef Wellington standards. The filling was very generous, moist and meaty, very tasty even if it was a little salty for my taste. But it came with a small pot of gravy which I think was  red wine and onion based and that balanced the salty pastie perfectly.   Very impressed, can't wait to return and eat in next time with friends so we can mix and match."}
{"text":"I'm completely impressed with this place. GREAT FOOD, FRIENDLY and ATTENTIVE staff and incredibly priced food (pastys range from $8.50-$12 and are really filling, apps were from $3.75-$6)!  I highly recommend this place. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best food, service, beer, atmosphere!! They specialize in these hand held absolutely delicious meat/veggie pies. The crust is light and fluffy-like. You have to try one to experience this heavenly taste. They have a variety of options. There is one for everyone!   Their specialty beers are so good! Different types for all you beer connoisseurs! I personally had he raspberry beer. So yummy!   Unfortunately, the only locations are Arizona and Nevada. I was lucky to visit the one in downtown Phoenix. Awesome location with 3 floors.  I'm from CA, so it looks like we'll have to make a trip to Las Vegas! Or a spontaneous road trip to AZ very soon!"}
{"text":"Important information first food is excellent the service is prompt did I mention the food was good. No gaming lots of alternative couples. Amazing place to hang out. Towards the end you consider eating a pasty with your fingers... That good"}
{"text":"A Californian approved British pub dive with a decent array of beers on tap, a lot of which I actually wanted to try --  but, since I'm on a business trip, I figured I'd save that pairing for my next spring training visit to this cactus town.  Atmospherically speaking, it is dark.  The windows are blacked out with drapes, the ground is dark, the furnishing is dark, and with a tinge of yellow lighting throughout the place, you truly feel like you're in a medevil pub.   The menu is filled with a decent variety of classic, vegetarian, and modern/fusion pasties.  As a newcomer from out of town, it was quite hard for me to decide which pasty to get.  Although I really wanted to try one of the 2 portobello mushroom varieties, I ended up getting a classic, the cottage pie.  To fulfill my fungi craving, I paired it with a very garlicky, and very flavorful mushroom spinach soup.  The cottage pie was decent, but after the blast of flavor concentrated soup, my mouth was just not amazed by their spot on authentication, of the bland British classic.  If you want the classic, you'll probably love the nostalgia of the pie.  If you want flavor and the experience you get from lots of aromatic compounds, the Cajun chicken and Mexican pasty smelled wonderful.    I for one will be coming back for the balsamic portobello pasty next, which probably means tomorrow night since my trip here shall end the following day.  And I shall keep coming back with every subsequent Phx trip till I've satisfied my tastebud's curiosity.  I guess I'm a bit OCD when it comes to joints with a rainbow of the same type of dish."}
{"text":"Guys, you need to do something about your takeout. Or stop doing it. The soggy undercooked pasties are just horrible. I write this from a 3 time experience.  I dined in over a hundred times. Foods pretty decent at the location. Great selection of beers. I got to applaud you guys for that.   ALso, your service isnt great ! and you don't have enough staff to take orders and serve them.    I would do more take outs if you could make an online ordering system. Over the phone, they just cant seem to hear with all the noise. And did i say you are understaffed."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. As I sat and waited for a friend at the bar earlier, I read about the pasty's history and sampled some of their yummy beers on tap. This was my second time there, and each time I visit, I get to enjoy a tasty pasty and awesome beer on tap. Tonight I had the traditional pasty and a yummy Nitro Porter."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awsome and always spot on. The food is amazing. The atmosphere is chill and hip. The prices are even better. The service is great. Everyone should try this place. Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"So happy this place now open! I know I would never get sick of the menu.. The Reuben is my favorite! Great ambiance and love the music.. Has a unique beer selection too! Bring anyone, any age, there's something they'll love offered ;)"}
{"text":"In town for work and stumbled upon this place.  Amazing food and great service!  Why is my rating in the mud then?  I returned the very next night and sat in the very same chair at the bar and didn't just get bad service, I got no service.  I sat there for 20 minutes (yes 20 minutes at the bar AND they weren't busy!) without as much as a \"how d'ya do\" from the server despite him seeing me.  At that point I decided to cut my losses and leave with an empty stomach.  I'm just glad I could justify giving these guys at least 2 stars because of the stellar service I received the first night."}
{"text":"This place is effin amazing! Hot fresh ingredients amazing pasty crust and sauce! Shepherds  pie is amazing ! Try this food! Love the divey bar lounge in the back with pool tables and pbr candles. Super dark and loungy hell yeah!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Food was outstanding and reasonably priced.  Great service and beer selection. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Arizona from CA and wanted to have the highest rated yelp restaurant in Tempe!  Cornish Pasty came up and it did not fall short of its reputation!  It's just heavenly!  The staff is extremely friendly and the food is incomparable!  I got the Pesto Chicken and it was so scrumptious!  The pocket was the right temperature and tenderness, and the filling was juicy.  My husband tried the Salmon with all the rave reviews on yelp, and it was so tasty!  The salad was fresh-loved the olives and cherry tomatoes.  The wait, however, was a bit long (maybe b/c the smell was too good so it felt really long to us.)  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Waited 70 minutes - they lost the order, Got attitude about the wait, its just happens I was told. \"I'll chek on your order\", was lied to 2x - then they admitted they lost the order. no offer to make it right, just a shoulder shrug and I'm sorry.. sometimes it happens was the response. Hard to believe they did not offer to make it right. Must be good but I'll never know."}
{"text":"Very good pasties!! I have tried a lot of their pasties, and they also have very good soups and salads. Don't overlook the soups! Found a new favorite with the red pepper soup. The sausage salad is also very good - homemade sage pork sausage, tasty toppings, and delicious dressing. The garlic mashed potatoes with cheese are very good.   The staff is very friendly and always ready with our drink."}
{"text":"I don't like fat people, but a pure drop of empathy landed on my brain the first time I ate Cornish Pasty's Banoffee Pie.  Now I understand what unlimited desire to eat is like.  Fucking delicious.  Thirst-buster sized beers.  Hail Satan."}
{"text":"The idea of this place is great. The ambiance is also great. The staff is very friendly. They have hard cider, which i liked.   Unfortunately, there is a weird smell of sewage or something when you walk past the front of the building. And the service was too slow. And the second time i went, there was a hair in my fries. Made me sad"}
{"text":"There aren't many great \"hole-in-the-wall's\" in the Tempe area, but man, Cornish Pasty Co. definitely falls into that category."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was excellent.  I had the lamb and mint and my wife had the Roast dinner pasty.  The meatball wrapped in bacon appetizer is my new favorite.  Everything was delicious and the employees were very attentive and courteous.  I would highly recommend this spot if you are in Las Vegas visiting or just a local looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Killer Parliament wings, not hot but like a mildly sweet rib bbq. Had the Italian pasty and it was about  3 lbs of pizza lunch meats in a pasty,  oh so tasty. She asked if I was the \"Ron Swanson\" type and if so Italian or the meat with cheese was the way to go.  Wife had the veggie cottage pie and darned if I wouldn't have known it was fake meat after tasting it. She said she probably won't get around to ordering anything else since tasting this gem. Great Staff, cool atmosphere and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you are unfamiliar with the pasty, run... don't walk, to the Cornish Pasty Co. to become acquainted. They serve up a couple of dozen varieties of this British dish from the traditional to the more ethnic.   The restaurant is small and dark but that only adds to its charm. Sit at the bar and watch them make magic as they create your pasty in front of you. They have a small beer selection with a handful on tap and a small liquor selection. Bonus: Irish car bombs are $3 at all times."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I would give it five stars except for that I've only been here once and the server at our table was kinda funky (both rude and nice, simultaneously). Great beer selection, and they have hard cider on draft which I appreciate with this type of cuisine. I had the chicken pot pie pasty and I will never have another pot pie again, it was that good. My friend had the Mexican Pasty and was in love with it. This place is definitely worth trying at least once, if not a hundred times over."}
{"text":"The food here is all right, the atmosphere better.  The lady and I got a couple of pasties, the shepherd's pie one and the cheese steak deal; they were okay, kinda bland, but hard to dislike something in a pie shell.  The atmosphere was about perfect for what you'd expect a British pub-type place to be. Dark, with lots of gregarious riff-raff and guys with beards about. Probably doesn't sound too appealing, but I found the authenticity to be nice."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Tempe, Arizona. I've been eating here regularly for over two years and have always had a great experience eating and with the restaurant staff."}
{"text":"I went there at night on a recommendation of a friend and didn't really know what to expect. The place is somewhat hidden and rather unpretentious compared to other restaurants. The place is lit by candles and soft lightings, with metal music playing in the background. Occasional rock and metal music plays in the back ground which goes well with the easy ambience. The place despite its unconventional getup offers intimacy for groups and also welcomes loners. They have a huge collection of beer, both domestic and imported, all reasonably priced. On to the main course - pasties. Comparing pasty with hot-pockets oversimplifies this delicacy. Alright, its roasted bread stuffed with cheese and your choice of meat, but there is so much more to it. Depending on what you get, you'll get to enjoy vibrant flavors that go well with your choice of alcohol (personal recommendation - get Buddingtons). Pasty recommendation: Peppered Lamb"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. I had the English chips with garlic to start, and I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. The pasty was delicious, it had a nice flaky crust and savory seasoning on the filling.   I didn't like where I was sat, which was all the way in the back by the kitchen. The place seems really old and not pleasant to look at."}
{"text":"You know that kind of meal that makes you smile through it? The environment, the beer, and bring your choice of companion to toss back and forth comments like \"mmmm\" and \"you gotta try this\" and \"one more beer please\".   Reinventing the pasty was a great idea.  Opening shop in vegas is an even better one."}
{"text":"The Pasty's here are pretty much gourmet hot pockets. I had the salmon pasty with a side of spicy beans.  Pros: -Great flavors with the salmon filling. Salmon was also cooked perfectly. -The dough was flaky and tender -The dill cream sauce that comes with the pasty is also great. -Car bombs are always good for brunch.  Cons: -Wasn't too into the spicy beans. They were too spicy for my liking, making it unbearable to eat."}
{"text":"This was a tough review to write because I've been here twice. Once at the recommendation of a friend and we had great service and great food. Last night was my second visit and my hope is that it was an off night because we had pretty lousy service and the food was not up to the par set at my previous visit.   We walked in and were told to take a table anywhere. We picked a spot that had been covered in crumbs and there was dried food on one of the menus sitting there. Several minutes passed and we were finally able to flag someone down to wipe down the table. At least another 10 minutes pass before I am able to flag a server to place a drink and food order - I asked if we could get our server and the woman told me it was her we were looking for. We asked to start with some oven fries and were informed \"it will take a long as the pasties to make.' Ok, this is fine. My brother had a chicken pot pie pasty and I had the chicken tikka masala pasty which I remembered as being so great from my last visit. And then...the wait.....was looong. Much longer than anticipated. I hope this was just an off night...in the meantime, it will be a while before I'd consider returning."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and eat here at least once.  They really know what they're doing with the food (peppered steak is my favorite), there's a good selection of higher-quality beer, and choices for everyone, including vegetarians - I know because I was one once.  Atmosphere is truly unique; the staff mostly plays the music that they want to hear, which can be a bit random but usually interesting.  The building is very narrow and often crowded, which somehow adds to the sense of fun rather than being annoying.  Just one thing: if you absolutely cannot stand hipsters you might want to stay away: the skinny jeans/fixed gear crowd is pretty well-represented.  On second thought, you should probably just lighten up and come anyway.  It's well worth it."}
{"text":"It's like going to a pub, the food is like hangover food, but noting to write home about. For the price, it wasn't all that much food, we left hungry and the only good thing were the expensive drinks. Also note when other say it's not good for kids. Just don't bother taking your kids, they do not have a kids menu (come on how hard is it to nuke chicken fingers) and their regular menu is not conducive to little noes. Maybe older kids, but not toddlers."}
{"text":"Boom... this place is the bomb. How could a gourmet hot pocket be bad, it's not.   I have been here 3 or 4 times and try something new every time It's always awesome... go here, just not on a diet. This is good, sleep inducing deliciousness."}
{"text":"Great find in a hard to find spot. Both classic pasties and interesting new ones sometimes straying across cultures to the world of empanadas and samosas with a twist. Interesting beer on tap and a larger selection in both bottle and can. Had the shepherds pie version well spiced with a red wine gravy. They weigh in close to a pound apiece so go hungry or share.   Location hint it is in the building in the middle of the parking lot not around the edges."}
{"text":"Is there a limit on the number of good reviews one restaurant can get? Well, let's test that theory! Yes, Cornish Pasty really is good. Yes, this location is REALLY LOUD (but fun)!! Don't bring your date for an intimate meal, especially if s/he's a bit on the hard of hearing side.   Thus far, I have tried both the Chicken Pot Pie pasty and the Cottage Pie pasty (the ground beef version of Shepherd's Pie). The Chicken Pot Pie pasty was just alright, but the Cottage Pie version was pretty darned awesome... Frankly, I was a little afraid of the \"ground minted lamb\" in the Shepherd's Pie, but maybe I'll try it next time, after drinking a cider to start out with. Did I mention the Strongbow Cider is worth a sip, or two, or three? (I like the fact that they have 3 sizes of Draft Beers, so that I don't have to special request a small glass...)"}
{"text":"Always good, and definitely filling for even the most bottomless of stomachs. The owner knows exactly what we want in a pasty...lamb vindaloo? Yes! Rosemary chicken? Please! Hamburger, cheese, and grilled onions? Oh my...I think I'm in pasty heaven!  Other plusses: delicious British brews on tap, big-big salads, and hooks for your backpack or purse at the bar. The lighting is forgiving if you've just had a typical ASU night...and if it's been a little too typical, you can take your pasty home, with handy heating instructions from the friendly pasty people."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but be sure to get it to go. The service is absolutely horrible. I keep coming back because I think, \"it must've been a bad night\" or \"we had a bad server.\" But nope!! Just awful service all around... after ordering all of our food together, one person's food never came. We brought it up to our server and said we'd take it to go. Forty minutes later and no check, no water refills, and no to-go order later... finally got our check and the dude threw the check down on the table like an ass. Not even worth the shitty service anymore."}
{"text":"Food great. We froze inside and drinks used Tempe water.  Water should be filtered. Service was good. Ambiance is dark and fun. Would order food again but order bottled drinks."}
{"text":"Really tasty place! They have a large selection of beers, both bottle and draft.  Also, their food is pretty awesome.  We had the bangers and mash, meat and cheese and rosemary steak.  The wine gravy was divine and the sage sausage was perfect.  The music and ambiance was hipster and super cute. The only ish was that the tables were not super clean.  The seats had some crumbs and goo so we opted for the bar."}
{"text":"The Banoffe Pie is bigger than you expect and THICK!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR A GREAT NIGHT!  I asked for a \"to-go\" box and I intend on using the whip cream for some indoor sports tonight. Thanks Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"The CPC is about a block from my condo.  Since I moved to Tempe, I've gained about 15lbs.  I'm fairly certain a large portion of this has to do with this restaurant.  When I cut myself shaving, I bleed red wine gravy.  I frequent CPC more than I should.  Guilty as charged.  The food is just...so damn good.  I'm also a fan of their dfraft beer selection.  32oz mugs of Hoegaarden or Dead Guy ale?  Yes, please.  I've turned many people on to the wonders of this place.  Out of all of my friends that tried it, the only one that didn't fully appreciate it was the one that had a lap band.  I don't recommend this place if your stomach is the size of a walnut because there will be some damage.  I've tried nearly all of the pasties (with the exception of the vegetarian ones) and it's difficult to pick a favorite.  I guess if I had to narrow it down to three, I'd choose (in no particular order), the Oggie, the chicken greek and the pilgrim.  Damn delectable!  I've also had their pasta salad.  It's huge.  I probably wouldn't get it again, though.  Why would I get that when I could have a pasty?  I thought I knew what comfort food was until I had my first pasty.  OK, so what about the interior?  There isn't much of it!  It's a hole in the wall.  The Mesa location is quite bigger, so if you're dead set on trying the food on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to check out the Mesa setting.  I've only had to wait for a table once, and it wasn't for very long, but I tend to visit during the off hours (late afternoon or later in the evening).  If you're flying solo, don't be ashamed to hop on a bar stool and watch the 20 something hipster dudes cook up gravy and other vittles.     Speaking of the employees, they're a motley bunch.  Service is usually pretty decent.  If you're a fan of tattoos, nearly all of the employees are inked.  It definitely lends a sense of style to the place.    There's a single unisex bathroom in the back.  If you gotta go, you gotta go.  I suggest forming a line if it's in use because I've seen people treat it like an airplane bathroom: they'll keep looking over their shoulder to see if the person inside has left and then get up, only to be cut off at the pass by someone seated closer doing the same bit.  I've only had one bad pasty experience.  My pasty was slightly over-baked.  I think the guy that baked it was over-baked, too.  Look at the eyes of some of the cooks.  They're redder than the gravy!  At any rate, that one pasty doesn't warrant the loss of a star compared to the dozens of other perfect pasties that I've had.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Leave your diet in your car and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Love love this place. casual and great food. I go there after a hard hike then beers and Salmon pasty taste like heaven! I wasn't familar with pasty but it's like great empanada and I love it!"}
{"text":"I took my motley crew out for lunch here.  I can not dine everywhere b/c like I said my crew is motley. Namely my 8 yr old that will swing from chandeliers and turn over tables. OK maybe a bit exaggerated but still a kid. So I thought this would be a safe joint. but  no, it has a bar like quality that really says \"hey we do not want little kids in here\" Maybe it was jus the kind of day they were having, us and one other table at the time but I counted 5 guys working. One looked smarmy and really pissed maybe felt crowded. This is a small establishment. So small.....  When my little one giggled and spun a bar stool around, The dude with the tude slammed something on the counter kind of freaked me out, I know we were not as annoying as that guy at he end of the place consuming PINTS but oh well.  I love pasty's and these were tasty. Will continue to patronage this establishment by calling in orders."}
{"text":"Was very busy but the food was excellent.  I left with a very satisfied tummy. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that I love Cornish Pasty. So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.  The very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!  I've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.  Although this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.  The main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.  I thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")  Anyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.  It's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you."}
{"text":"Amazing pastys!!!!! Soooo many options and extensive vegetarian menu too. Great service. We had a large group of 10 that came here after a concert and got there at 11:30pm there kitchen was still fully open and running. Great service."}
{"text":"Great food, plenty options. Good place to hangout. New location is larger and  looks much cooler but seems to have lost the laid back atmosphere though. Still plenty of reasons to come back."}
{"text":"Never understood food fully until I ate at Cornish Pasty, Never know it from the outside. Mix that with chill employees and badass shop, this is could be the best dinner of all times"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Las Vegas and you are tired of the noisy, artificial \"strip\", come to the Cornish Pasty Co. Nice people, good music, food made with love, cosy atmosphere and good beers..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Beer selection is incredible as well. Service is casual, friendly, and overall very pleasant. It's a bit dark when you first enter, but I would recommend this place to everyone from my neighbor to my grandmother. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME."}
{"text":"Too loud and dark inside and waaay too smokey outside, if that is your scene, then you would probably enjoy the Cornish Pasty co. Service was also really slow and my food was super salty and luke warm when it did finally come, blech!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to say what has already been said, this place is the jammy jam, there isn't a bad item on the menu.  I love the atmosphere, very intimate, hole in the wall.  I guess the only downfall is in fact its size, which can be limiting, if they are busy.    The only words of wisdom I would have, is don't shy away from the desserts.  The banoffee pie seems like it \"might\" be a good idea, but I can ensure you, it is amazing!    Definitely one of my favorite spots in the area!"}
{"text":"Brah ... Brah!?  Drove up to the place and was immediately spooked. This place is definitely a picture perfect example of hole in the wall.   But walk through the hole and ... blaka!!!   I had half of the lamb and mint & bangers and mash. Never had British food but if you want try something new this has got to be on your list. Good selection of brews good ambiance. I tried this place on a whim because of the reviews from previous Yelpers. I was not disappointed. So if your passing through Vegas and feeling adventurous give it a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Big Fan since moving here. Took the Brits and they say it's the real deal. Salmon is my favorite."}
{"text":"Oh what a night! We started off eating dinner on the patio then headed to the bar to meet friends and received stellar service all around. Our server Jill was friendly and made the night extra enjoyable. She was all smiles even though it was an obviously busy, demanding night. I can't wait to come back for another visit."}
{"text":"Every pasty I have had has been delicious. They also have a great selection of beers.  My favorite is chicken tiki masala wings and lil bit of salmon pasty.  Similar to a fancy hot pocket or pot pie. So delicious and very filling.   The atmosphere is dark and hipster."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite, unique restos in the Phoenix area.  What is a pasty? Think about is as an empanada. If you don't know what that is then think about as...[moan]...a Hot Pocket.  As far as the pasties go, the Lamb Vindaloo is my favorite. I've also tried The Chicken Greek (least favorite), Chicken Tikka Masala, Lovely Bit a Salmon, and the Peppered Steak. They also have a good selection of vegetarian pasties even though I have yet to try them.  This place has expanded and added a lot more space on the other side, but, in my opinion, lost a bit of charm. Something about being uncomfortably hot near the ovens on a summer day in a somewhat cramped setting equals pure character, and I do miss it. Unless I'm hungry.  The staff is laid-back and pretty cool reminding me of dives in Austin, Charlotte, and Philly.  If you want, you can get the pasties half-baked so you can take them home and pop them in a 425-degree oven for 15-20 minutes. But why deprive yourself the experience of enjoying it here?"}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat in the afternoon. The place look nice little pit dark which is kind of good but the floor need to be cleaner. The service is very good you could see them working together like if they were friends. It's a dafently for people who like rock music and it's not too loud for who don't like it. What really want to know about this place is food starting with soup. Did you know that if u like more that a soup you can ask to teast two of them and by the way cream of leek, potato & Stilton is the best. For main food you have a big selections veggie people its to you too. Veggie Mexican and spicy asiago are most try. What dessert peanut butter and jelly. Sticky toffee pudding."}
{"text":"Had a birthday shindig here and wanted to make a reservation so I tried calling. Didn't answer for one day and put me on hold but forgot about me the second day day so I had to physically go down there. Food is amazing. Need more servers. Lower stars because they gave us a wine glass with lipstick on it."}
{"text":"I went here the other day and it was kind of hard to fine I mean even my GPS didn't know where it was. I'm not really a fan of beer and they didn't have Ciroc but I did like the set up inside. Overall I'm giving it a two out of five stars mainly because it was hard to find and it wasn't really enough parking when I walked inside and saw all those people I was wondering where everybody parked up because there wasn't enough parking spots for the amount of people that were inside!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food was amazing, staff is great and they play great music! Anywhere I can walk in and here The Clash and The Ramones is great and the food is even better! Great veggie and vegan options as well! I've been here twice in two weeks! Also really good beer selection!"}
{"text":"Finally. Finally!!! A solid British pub. Service was great (more than I can say for some actual pubs in London) and food was absoflippinlutely stellar. We shared the Shepard's Pie, Bangers and Mash, and the broccoli cauliflower cheese bake (yes, there were leftovers). It was impossible to pick a favorite and this will definitely be on my go-to list when in Tempe. The beer list is superb and I had a hard time choosing as there were so many of my favorites from overseas travel. My only wish? Murphy's on tap."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Many vegetarian options - the only restaurant I know of that uses Quorn products, which I buy for my home - cuz they're delicious!  Way to Go CPC!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the royal with cheese, omgosh yum. It was the best french fry/burger thing, I've ever eaten. Very very tasty. I got my order to go, and it was snappy service, and they were friendly.  The only negatives are that this also doubles as a bar and the drink prices are meh, and it looks super sketchy at night.  Overall though, I recommend going to this place because it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"When the Cornish Pasty Co was on Sahara Ave in the little hole in the wall place the food was better, oh so much better. Now that it's on Charleston Blvd so much has changed.  The red wine sauce is watery and sweet now and tastes like a can. The meat is dry and bland. There is less filling then before. The prices are higher especially on the bottled ginger beer. It took over an hour on a non-busy shift to receive my food. Waitresses ignored my existence.   What's so disappointing is that before they moved I brought my whole family since my dad remembers his Mom making pasties. We were getting to know the cooks and become regulars. Now this place feels like every other mass produced gimmick. The one place I truly loved and you guys let someone twist the goodness out of it.  SMH"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food, ambiance, service & drinks! From a British couple, it's as close as you will get to incredible pasty's, apart from being in Cornwall!"}
{"text":"This place is great, love the food everything I've had is awesome... The lamb & mint is my favorite"}
{"text":"Oh i love thee cornish pasty!!!! Seriously so good! I love the vibe and atmostphere of this place, I know its super hipster and trendy but it's a nice place to eat and experience a delicious meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy, I love the vibe in the restaurant will definitely have to bring my friends here"}
{"text":"Delicious. Good selection of beer, tasty pasty, and absolutely adore the toffee pudding dessert. Get it with the cream and not the ice cream"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.. Yes I'm in love and I plan to try more items on the menu. I came later at night so it was a bit dark and loud from me. Hard to have a conversation with a soft voice, but eassssy to stuff your face with delicious pasties!"}
{"text":"Simply great.  Excellent array of beers on tap and in the bottle.  Decent wine list.    Food was fantastic.  Was with a group so I had the luxury of sampling a number of entrees.  The carne adovada was phenomenal.  Whatever dish you think you want, get it the second time you go and have the carne adovado first!"}
{"text":"Don't order to go. They will give you cold burnt food. Chocolate bread pudding was completely burnt. We tried to finish it but couldn't."}
{"text":"This place is the muthaf*ck*in shiiiiiiiiiiit. Everyone here is awesomr, real friendly like and happy. The pasties come steaming hot and delicious. Good shit yo!"}
{"text":"I've visited four or five times now, and each time have been glad that I did. Yes, it's loud. It's dark. The lights flicker. And the claustrophobic should think twice. Combined with consistently phenomenal food, these are all aesthetically compelling reasons to absolutely love this place. I generally stick to the vegetarian menu; last night I tried the eggplant parmesan, which was incredibly satisfying. And they do have some rather decent beer on tap. The staff are friendly and accommodating: even the bus-boy was upbeat and helpful as we navigated their dense menu.  It's a pain in the ass to get a table (as it should be), so choose your one best friend and sit at the bar.  Do it."}
{"text":"After seeing a sign on the door for what felt like three years, Cornish Pasty is finally open and ready for business.  And the best news?  They have tons of vegetarian options!  Located in the same plaza as Thai staples Komol and Lotus of Siam, Cornish Pasty is a smaller space but cozy and inviting.  Think of it as a local pub with lots of good food.  Speaking of food, we ate a ton of it.  I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton soup (fyi: this is vegetarian/no chicken stock).  The cup is a good portion, and served with two large pieces of homemade bread and homemade butter.  It's a steal for $3.50.  Although I really enjoyed it, the Stilton cheese it might make the soup a little salty for some people.  As for the pasties, I wanted something more traditional and ordered the Cheese and Onion.  It tasted great and everything was cooked well, but I couldn't bring myself to use the ketchup or marina that came with it.  My husband had the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala and his was really good as well.  There was a nice blend of spices and it came with a side of mint-yogurt dressing that we both enjoyed.    Cornish Pasty also offers a decent beer selection and a 14-oz will set you back $6.   I loved the atmosphere here and all the employees were laid-back and friendly.  Cornish Pasty would even make a good spot just to grab a few drinks for an evening.  I can't speak for the authenticity of the food (which is questionable considering they offer a Mexican pasty), but I do know that I enjoyed what I ordered. The pasties are large and filling so make sure to bring your appetite!  Note to Vegetarians: They use Quorn in about half of their veggie pasties.  While being a popular meat-alternative in the UK, this was the first time my husband and I have ever had it.  I found it to be pretty much the same as most other faux-meats.  I'm sure they could leave it out of the pasties if you asked them.  Note to Vegans: According to their menu, they offer at least two vegan pasties daily.    Note to Omnivores: If my vegetarian pasties tasted awesome, you have nothing to worry about.  And may I suggest trying a vegetarian pasty?"}
{"text":"Oh man, how does one describe perfection.  I absolutely LOVE this place with a passion.  I literally cannot stop dreaming about the next time im gonna go in, The variety they have is awesome, i originally wanted to try all of them, and got a good start, then found a couple favorites, the Chicken Tiki Masala one is phenominal, and the potato soup is to die for.  But it comes out super hot, dont eat it immediately.  Its like lava, but delicious lava. ALSO the peanut butter and jelly pasty is SOOOO good.  haha.  And the potatotes.  Damn, pretty much everything is great.  Do yourself and your buddies a favor and GO!"}
{"text":"Ok the inside of the place was a lil dated and you really couldn't tell who worked there. But all that doesn't matter once you get the food. The homemade lemonade was the right balance of sweet and sour. The wings were fantastic sweet/spicy and tender. Omg the pastie...first time trying a pasty (spicy chicken) but definitely won't be the last. Also had the delicious Carmel Apple pasty for desert. Fantastic food for a fantastic price! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for 8 years.  Never had a bad experience with service or food.  Top notch on all counts."}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful surprise. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was quite comfortable. Our server, Ally, went out of her way to be sure our party of four was taken care of. In fact, the service was world class, yet the prices were neighborhood eatery. We will go back again and again!  Now I know what a pasty is!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of people tell me to go here and I finally saw what all the rage was about. The lamb and mint was delicious. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Was brought here by a group of coworkers, that promised good things.  Good things is what I got!   Never had I heard of a Pasty.. and now I'm very glad we've been introduced. They are delicious! And the variety that Cornish Pasty Company provides is incredible.  I enjoyed the Rosemary Chicken (I had ordered the Salmon, however it was unavailable, sad... next time), and everything else my coworkers ordered looked and smelled delicious as well. The salads were huge, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Ive eaten three times here. No more unless Im looking for mediocre food. All three different pasties Ive had were far from flavorful. The last one (carne adovado) was downright dreadful. Pork was bone dry and nothing but heat from chiles as flavor.  Never been impressed by their novelty food. Instead of cooking one type of food real well they serve a so so mishmash of cuisines. But people find it good cause its in hot pockets."}
{"text":"Great spot to try something new. We ( the four of us) shared 3 pasties. Lamb vindaloo, peppered beef, and Cajun chicken.  So good.  Light crust. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable  We also tried the garlic oven chips. YUM Highly recommended for a lite bite."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to eat in yet but I did get to try their tikka masala chicken salad and it was good. We got it for a work meeting. I loved the dressing with it but the salad was somewhat lacking. The chicken was great but the veggies in the salad weren't as plentiful as I had hoped.   Everyone else's food looked great and it made me wish I could have a pasty (dang gluten!). I would suggest checking this place out as it has probably the only English food I've seen in Tempe."}
{"text":"What a great place to have a meal and a beer.  I like the fact they have expanded this location but I normally go to the location on Dobson in Mesa."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, \"Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!\" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.  While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!  The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was \"effing delicious\" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy.   Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.  Definitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!"}
{"text":"This is my first Pasty (past-ee) and its pretty rocking. Apparently it's an English miner (like the coal miner kind of miner) food from the 13th century. The crust is my new favorite sandwich thing ever. It's like eating a pastry somewhat but thicker and its weird to describe or maybe I'm just not very eloquent but it's the business. I can see this place as being a big to-go option for me because it's a convenient way to get food food on the run. Excellent beer selection, small but inspired wine selection, no hard alcohol. Service was excellent the owners came by and checked in me and talked about the history of Pasty and answered my questions which is a big deal in an Applebee's world. If you want to bring someone to lunch/dinner where you don't have to worry if they'll find something they like on the menu and it will impress them with your ingenuity in chic restaurants this is where you wanna be."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, and it is definitely authentic British food. We also liked the feel of the place. Our waiter service was very good as well!  I think that this type of food is just not my thing though. It was a bit heavy, and I had a stomach ache that evening. It also seems to be a bit dirty (the place is dark, so it's difficult to see!)."}
{"text":"Pasties are awesome.  They are freshly baked pockets filled with yummy goodness.  This is not 5-star dining, but it is good comfort food.  I have tried the lamb and mint, bangers and mash, and pesto chicken.  All are tasty, but I really recommend the bangers and mash.  The sausage and mash potatoes went really well together.  Really, you can never go wrong with mash potatoes.  The sitting area is very small, but the bar can be an interesting option since you get to see the cooks at work.  I usually go for lunch, so I cannot speak to their beer selection.  That would certainly go well with a pasty though...  Keep your eyes peeled when going there for the first time.  It is easy to miss!  I usually pull into the parking lot from Hardy Dr off University.  The restaurant is facing Hardy."}
{"text":"\"Pasties were originally filled with strawberry jam, eaten by miners in the UK. Not very authentic  but I see these ppl got creative\" -- my Brit buddy from London.  From my POV: Pretty chillaxed place.  The food is incredibly greasy if you're into that stuff.  It was pretty different for my taste. (Then again, I'm a VERY picky eater) I had the mashers and bangers (mashed potato and pork stuffed into a greasy shell like that on a chicken pot pie except richer in fat). It was so and so. Kind of bland.  Second time around, I had the Italian style one with Salami and other yummy stuff in it. It was much better than the bland mashers and bangers.  I'm 5 ft 1 and 90 lbs, I couldn't finish one full pasty."}
{"text":"I found Cornish Pasty via yelp about 2 years ago while visiting Phoenix area for work.  It made such an impression on me,I keep hoping i get to go back to try more variations on the pasties.  We had so much fun with beer and music also last time that i hope the expansion didn't get rid of the hole in the wall feeling.  Anyway my coworkers are placing orders for me to bring back pasties for them.  I don't know how i'm gonna fly with those, but we'll see.   It's probably gonna be  110 plus or minus, but the fact that with of all the great places in phoenix im still drooling about this one means i gotta give it a 5."}
{"text":"Amazing food , the chicken pot pie is nothing to write home about . But the tomato soup is amazing especially with the bread."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down, my favorite place to eat in Vegas. Incredible food (Greek, peppered steak, and Reuben pasties are my go-to--I recently discovered the Stilton leek soup and fresh bread made in house). Great ambiance, especially with new location. Really lovely staff--Kendall and Jake are especially welcoming and accommodating. You won't regret going here!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the old cave-of-a-restaurant before their remodel and I'm still a fan now. Back in the days when the pasties came in just butcher paper, the cramped seating, and seeing, hearing, and smelling the cooking going on behind the bar gave it a sort of life and a lot of character. It definitely gave you a sense that you were one of those miners with their pasties. Well, with a lot less arsenic and grime.  My favorite of the flaky goodness are the Meat n Cheese with HP sauce, Bangers and Mash with the wine sauce, the Cajun, Rosemary Steak. I should list the pasties I don't like.  ...  Okay moving on to the new decor. It's dark, the chairs are church pews, the new bar is huge, and the atmosphere is a bit like a movie theatre before the previews show up. It still gets packed and people are hustling everywhere.  The service is good but there was a time where we couldn't find our server. Anywhere. The good part about the old place was that someone was always within reach if you needed anything. A few times it was even the owner!  Bottom line is that all of the pieces and parts in these pasties come together in an awesome sauce kind of way. The ingredients are definitely not cheap."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  More than anything, its a trendy place among hipsters who wear ski hats in the summer and come here to translate the meanings of their eastern-inspired tattoos with their hipster fiends.  Overcrowded and they sit you next to strangers.  Pass if you aren't in an identity chrisis."}
{"text":"Wow, how did I miss writing a review for one of my favorite eateries?   I can't even count on both hands the number of times I've indulged in a pasty and beer. Basically, I'm trying to work my way through the menu! :) And for the love of god don't miss out on the dessert.  I love the food and atmosphere. Service is sometimes sub par but hey it's more of a pub atmosphere so it doesn't seem to bother me half as much.   Eat, drink and be merry with a pasty!"}
{"text":"Since there is no other place like it - 5 stars.  So freakin good, I wish there was one in Tucson.  I had the original pasty with meat, potatoes and gravy. Simply devine comfort food. The baked cauliflower and broccoli side was also excellent. I wished I would have tried everyone else's pasty, but I was on a mission to finish mine and that huge 32oz. beer.   Love the old-time photos of miners and traditional pub decor. I can't wait to get back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great bar and great service! The menu offers something for all pasty lovers!"}
{"text":"Love this place but they need to start measuring their seasonings. Sometimes it's perfect and at times it's way too salty. Or too peppery. But their food when made correctly is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food! They have a lot of meat and vegetarian options, and provide a different food option than most places around here. Great customer service and delicious beer options too! The only way I could like it more is if it had a little more lighting inside and outside."}
{"text":"This place is really fun and eclectic.  The servers look like a mix between hipsters and homeless, but the food is amazing and the service is fantastic.  I felt right at home and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought the atmosphere of the pub was nice and since this was the first time I stopped there for food, maybe the other items on the menu are enjoyable (considering the good reviews). But my experience and review is just for the following: Being from Michigan, I have had plenty of opportunities to eat pasties, but these lacked so much flavor and I was not happy about how much they charged for them, for what I got. Bought 2 of their Oggie traditional pasties to go. When I placed my order and found out that they didn't even have carrots in them, I was disappointed but took a chance because rutabaga was included, which is a MI tradition. They were dry. I could BARELY find the sliced steak pieces and onions! It was ridiculous. The only saving grace was the steak was lean and not chewy and the pastry shell was good. Who makes a pasty without a size-able amount of steak or any kind of meat?? They must think no one will notice or they're trying to cut corners to save money. Their wine gravy that came with it, must be an acquired taste. Will never go there again unless I'm forced to."}
{"text":"Words cannot begin to describe the glory that is this fine establishment. Never had bad service or a bad meal. These puff pastry stuffed bundles of heaven erupt with surgically precise flavor combinations that leave me speechless every single time.   My new favorite is the Lamb & Mint, a delicious combination of succulent and juicy lamb, perfectly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and of course, the fresh mint sprigs make for a truly transcendental dining experience.   After tasting more than 3/4 of their menu, I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy. I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon.   The vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.  The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.  The location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.  I wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I am usually wary of Western (as in American/English/etc.) cuisine. There aren't many choices available and the few that are, usually turn into disappointments.  Cornish has a separate menu for vegetarians. But make no mistake - this menu is not your usual disappointing veggie substitute stuff. It lists a variety of items that are delicious so I never feel like I have to settle. We've been to the Mesa location and love the ambience there. It has great service and is relatively easy on the pocket.   I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!!! Cider + pasty = amazing lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Just ate there for my first time and it was delicious. Great, friendly staff and the food was phenominal! I had the Carne Advocada, which was superb (tasty with a little heat that lingers), and the PB&J Pasty dessert (absolutely amazing). I will definitely come back (when I'm back in town)."}
{"text":"Very nice place and awesome pastries. There haven't been a single instance when my pastry was not good, it has been always awesome. There are so many options for every kind of taste. Everyone I have taken there for lunch has liked whatever they have ordered. Decor and setup is very good and different than a regular lunch place. There was only one instance, when I felt bad because they asked us to free up the table when we were having a short after lunch talk, I can understand their constraint because it was raining outside and there were few people waiting for their table. Other than this instance, it has always been a nice place to have tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Probably my boyfriends and my favorite place. The food is always amazing as well as the bar staff. We love that every now and then we get to hear some rap music late at night. For those who say it's dirty, it's not. It's a little divey so if you're not into that then it might not be the spot for you. As for us, we can't get enough."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A wonderful hole in the wall, with utterly delicious and unique food in the Vegas valley. I ordered the meat and cheese pasty, it was cooked to order and the crust was tender and flaky, the filling the interior was so yummy, it was good enough without the red wine gravy, but if you know what's good for you, try that gravy! It's like noneother I've had before. A hip, casual place with a great beer selection..plus Blackthorne cider ON TAP. Now, I thnk I have a new place to nosh for a great meal!"}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 13 including 4 children at 630. I called a head at 11am to reserve a spot on the patio, they took my name/phone number and was assured we would have a table. We arrived about 5 mins early and they informed us that there wasn't room on the patio or the dining area. We were told to pick out a spot in the bar area (with 4 children). No one helped us put chairs or tables together and we still had to cram into a spot that didn't fit us. That was a frustrating experience. We were a family coming to enjoy a birthday dinner together, the music was so loud and we couldn't hold conversation.  Casey was our bartender/server and she was awesome. She was on top of drink refills and was very patient/pleasant, I know that large parties are not always the easiest.  As for the food, it was delicious as always which is why I am still providing a 4 star rating.  I will definitely come back but without children and the rest of the family."}
{"text":"I went here a while ago and tried the rosemary chicken and it was excellent. Every bite was delicious. I have been wanting to go back for months now and I keep looking at the menu thinking of what I will order, but I can't get the rosemary chicken out of my mind! I wish I could try them all but I think I'll just end up ordering the same thing again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend (a local) during a recent business trip to Vegas.  I specifically mention that we came for lunch because when I first mentioned it to my friend, he described the area as \"a bit sketchy\" and was concerned about going there a night.  So, lunch it was!  And an excellent lunch it was too!  Arriving sometime after 1pm, we enjoyed ample parking (in a giant, somewhat sketchy strip mall), and just a handful of customers in the restaurant.  We grabbed two seats at the bar and were greeted promptly.  Side note: I read complaints in other reviews about the bar seats.  They are not bar stools, at least not like any stools I have sat on before.  They are formed, metal seats that I felt offered a much better sense of stability.  Were they comfortable?  Well, they didn't bother me at all.  OK, back to the meal.  I ordered the Oggie, their \"Traditional\" pasty, which was filled with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga, and served with a side of red wine gravy.  My friend ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which as it so happened, the cook was assembling fresh right before our eyes.  This food is hearty, savory and delicious!  The staff are friendly and inviting.  All said and done, even with it's off the beaten path location, my friend (the local) thanked me for discovering CPC and told me that he will be a frequent visitor.  Give it a shot!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great rosemary steak pasty. The Banger and mash pasty was outstanding. Greek salad had a ton of feta cheese on it, which I liked. The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful. Great tunes, service was flawless. I'm going back."}
{"text":"yum yum yum.  These pasties are waaaaay better than any of the ones I ate when I lived in England (not sure if that's saying much- sorry british folk).  They also have a nice selection of beer, tasty belgians that go well with a pasty."}
{"text":"location of the shopping center is a little off putting but it is worth the trip! The restaurant is clean, neat & the restrooms are large & clean. The staff is very helpful & friendly.  NOW TO THE REALLY  IMPORTANT PART.  The pasties are made fresh daily, you can even watch them roll the dough , make the various stuffing mixes and bake them. The taste is authentic- we had pasties in England and Ireland. One pasty is a meal, you are stuffed. There area a variety to chose from but our favorite was the Oggie, the original pasty. The fries are long, thick,  crisp, gently spiced & the portions large.   You will thank yourself for eating there.  We ate there twice while in Las Vegas  during the July 4 holiday & highly recommend them."}
{"text":"It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.  So there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.  Second, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint.  Not a huge selection for picky kids, but that won't stop me from coming"}
{"text":"YUM!  The crust is tender and the fillings incredible! Something for everyone, even the vegetarians in your life.  You've got to try this place and you'll keep coming back.."}
{"text":"One of the most fun places with really amazing food. Always love the veggie chicken tikka masala pasty. The tomato soup and banoffee pie are excellent too. Big fan!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique and worth checking out if you've never been. They have some nice vegetarian  options too like vegetarian rosemary chicken."}
{"text":"I was told the food is made every morning. I am seriously doubting that they make 40+ variations of these every morning. I had an \" original\" steak and potato, very bland and a little burnt. It also took 20 minutes, which is long to sit and wait. Service was so-so, maybe average. If your're drunk at 1 a.m. this is the place, if you're sober eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuuuuuuuum.   This was our first pasty experience, and boy were we happy that Cornish provided our Wednesday night fare. I had the lamb and mint; Josh had the alfredo pasty. The red wine gravy that accompanied my dish was AMAZING. The pasties themsevles look a little on the small side, but they filled us right up. Good people, good atmosphere, happy tummies."}
{"text":"We ordered the Oggie and the spicy Asiago chicken pasty.. One word.. BOMB!!! It's crispy.. It's fresh.. It's tasty.. Flavorful.. We will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"This is TRULY as good as it gets! My mom and I had discovered this interesting bar and restaurant after searching for British food on Yelp. I have been to Cornish Pasty Co. about three or four times since my mom and I first went there and I have never left unhappy or hungry :) I personally love the Bangers and Mash pasty and the Oggie pasty (a classic) and the chips are delicious: crispy and just burnt enough to still be fantastic! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to a casual pub or who loves British food :)"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! I eat here any chance I get. I love everything about it. The location is convenient for me, the atmosphere is exactly what I like in a restaurant. It's laid back and not stuffy. Staff is attentive but not pushy. Music is eclectic like much of its staff and clientele. I feel at home here. The beer selection is fantastic! The food is out of this world. My usual is The Pilgrim but I have had many others and have never had a pasty I didn't like. This is a regular spot for me and I am SO glad it's in my life!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? How have I not been here before? I found myself in the area of this place yesterday, so finally stumbled in. First off, the people who work there are really friendly and helpful. I think the guys name was Justin. Anyway, since I never had a pasty before, I required some direction and the menu has just about every kind of great filling you can think of to put in your pasty. I settled on the cheesesteak pasty. Since I didn't know what kind of sauce to order with it, Justin brought me three different ones. Red wine gravy, peppercorn sauce and some mustard cream sauce.  As it turned out, they were all great but the peppercorn was my favorite. I gotta tell you, the pasty was great. though I have no previous pasty experience, I can say that this pasty was terrific, the service was great and I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love eating here! Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to bring friends because not only is their food delicious and their service excellent, but their cozy atmosphere really helps make your dining experience feel so much more intimate! Plus, with all the different pasty fillings on their menu, there is literally something for everyone. Even my vegan friends! I love the fact that they always offer at least two vegan options every single day. Their pretty diverse beer/cider menu also make it a great spot to meet for just some drinks, although I can never stop by without getting a pasty! The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because you cannot alter the contents of a pasty filling unless you give them a call 24 hours in advance. Although it is nice that you have the option of calling ahead and customizing your meal, most of the time I go there on a whim and do not have this opportunity. Being unable to remove certain ingredients is a bit of a bummer, and although I understand why this is not possible (I believe they are all pre-stuffed in the morning?), it still makes me sad."}
{"text":"Incredible concept and awesome food. I hit this place everytime I'm in Phoenix. The service is attentive and friendly. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Disappointed expectations I guess.  Expecting emphasis on the Cornish and Pasty in the name, if they had referenced 'country blues bar' I would have rated it higher.  Very loud, very dark.  There is a decent selection of tap beer, some British.  Had trouble with the Manhatten, very sweet.  The pasties look better than they taste.  Very disappointed in the 'open kitchen' as it looked pretty dirty and the line cooks like to pound their knives on the cutting boards rather often (and oh that hurts me so to watch a knife get abused on its cutting edge).  The crowd seemed to be having fun, so must know what they are getting into."}
{"text":"I have been to this place probably like 8-10 times since my last review, it has become one of the few places my (now) husband will go out of our DTPHX neighborhood now. **Still waiting for the Downtown spot to open up, they promise soon but I am not holding my breath :/ Still, I don't mind driving, what, like 12 minutes to the Tempe location to enjoy an awesome date night and a tasty as heck, filling, meal. I have not had another vegan pasty, decided that they do the others so good that I will indulge in the heavier tastier options instead! I pretty much always get the Lamb and Mint one but the last two times I got the Original which is similar to the lamb and mint (same sauce option) and less expensive (I can be kinda... thrifty I'll call it) We have have their cocktails a few times with no disappointment and they always have the Union Jack IPA which is one of my favorites! We always leave soo full and need a nap usually right when we get home but we always feel so satisfied. It's turned into the spot my friends and I go to together and we have even done the take-home ones at some small get-togethers we've had! This and Welcome Diner have been my all time favorite spots here in Phoenix and everyone needs to experience it! Been wanting to take my parents here forever, was hoping to get to enjoy the DTPHX one but may just have to bite the bullet and take that long 12 minute drive to Tempe! Thanks for always being consistently awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best waitress/bartender ever!  Never in need of anything!  Kasie didn't miss a beat, she was very attentive, non-stop/on the go to make everyone's visit very pleasant!  The food was to die for!  I had the Cajun chicken and my husband the Guinness stew, delicious!!!  And the sticky toffee pudding, oh my!!!  Definitely will revisit this gem!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! I always get the Greek Vegetarian pasty. I want to try something else but this ones just too delicious. For a special treat, go for the Banoffee pie! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"(Has Vegan and Veg options) This bar has a great atmosphere, staff, and a huge range of pasty choices to choose from, even vegan and vegetarian specials. You're getting a LOT of pasty for the price. The bar serves UK beers on tap, but honestly my favorite part that reminded me of my years in Liverpool was the mushy peas. If you've never had mushy peas I beg you to try them! It is not baby food I PROMISE. The atmosphere, like I said, is great. Not kitschy like other UK bars in town tend to be.... (Cough). It is dark and broody and GREAT for a cold winters eve. Pile in and enjoy the British vibes how'd be done in England."}
{"text":"I am writing this with both respect and frustration for this restaurant. Having spent time in the UK, I was familiar with the famous \"meal in a pastry\" that originates from the mining town of Cornwall.   Few restaurants compare when it comes to simplicity and variety. I have become addicted to the cajun with it's spicy chicken, ham, and cheesy goodness. My girlfriend always seems to order the veggie tikka masala. I have tried much of the menu, and as long as you stay with the pasties, you are fine. The potato dishes are sort of hit and miss. The cheesy one is sort of bland  and the curried potato lacks the crunchiness that would otherwise put it on a great tapas menu. Finally, I would add that the beer selection is quite good and offers several sizes of great draft beers from the British Isles.  So yeah, food is great, and for dine in the prices are decent. My big frustration, and the reason I am writing this has to do with my experience tonight. I have taken to ordering pasties to go because the wait staff is often slow or inattentive. This is normally fine because I can stay at home and watch a movie while I eat. Indeed, I have been trying to save money by ordering half-baked pasties, and in the past they have knocked a dollar off of each of the pasties I've ordered regardless of type. Tonight I ordered two half-baked pasties to take home and the woman operating the cash register refused to give me the usual dollar off. Very, very annoying and this is the sort of inconsistency in the staff that keeps me from awarding five stars. Food=great, service=less than stellar."}
{"text":"It's hard to choose just one with the variety of pasty's they make! Wonderful crispy flakey pastry with fresh flavor combos inside. Definitely a place to work your way through the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Vegas.  The best way to describe a pasty, as my friend put it, an adult hot pocket. The pastry on the the outside is so thin, flaky and warm and the inside is for your choosing. I've had a couple of different pasties but my absolute favorite is the bangers (sausage) and mash with red wine gravy. It's so simple but so satisfying. The gravy is so smooth and goes perfectly with a lot of the other pasties.   They also have a great selection of beer that all the bartenders have knowledge of. Another plus is Irish car bombs for $4 all day! Cheers!"}
{"text":"this place was awesome! me and a friend were first timers, but i have heard many good things. we arrived around 12:30p right around lunch rush. it was pretty packed but we waited probably not more then 2 minutes for a table. our waitress was super nice, and the food came out pretty fast too.  i had the royale with cheese, and my friend had the shepards pie. both awesome. cant wait to go back to try some new stuff. good beer selection, and pretty well priced for everything. on top of all that the great staff/service all and all a great experience. glad i finally got to try it."}
{"text":"Delicous pasties and great beer selection! They will make vegan pasties too if you call ahead of time to order.... What more could you ask for?! I email them asking if they have vegan options and this was the response (I hope they don't mind me posting this):   \"Yes we can make vegan pasties with your choice of ingredients chosen from any of our vegan ingredients in the menu, or we can come up with a surprise pasty from one of our cooks...? Please just call the store of choice an hour and a half before you wish to eat.\"   Loving this place!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  I started with the potato, leek, and stilton cheese soup which was pretty good.  The bread that they served it with, however, was fantastic!  It turns out that they bake it there fresh every day, and it was wonderful - dense, chewy, and flavorful.  It was great on its own, but was also good to mop up the soup with!  I had the oggie for my main meal, and it was very good.  The red wine gravy was a nice addition."}
{"text":"The place is small, great for a quick lunch and feels like you're in the city (decoration/mood).  I've had the Oggie and the Royale. It has enough vegetarian choices, too. I like the Veggie Greek. My favorite is the Greek salad!! That dressing! I want the recipe.   The service is always good and the drinks as well.  The Mesa location, just wasn't the same. But it has a patio and it's bigger."}
{"text":"Been going to their Tempe location for years and always look forward to it. My favorite is the Veggie Pesto. I have also tried their Mesa location, much larger and could easily handle a big group. Customer service is great. If you are looking for fast food this is not it. Whenever I visit the area I like to pick up a cold pasty wrap it with ice packs and put it in my luggage to share with those back home; ten minutes in the oven and it's a beautiful meal."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times and LOVE it. My husband and I are beer snobs (err connoisseurs), and they always have a great selection of yummy brews. My favorite pasty is the Lovely Bit of Salmon, and it sure is ... well ... lovely. I don't know how they manage to get so much delicious into a little pastry pocket. I was afraid the whole thing would taste fishy, but it was perfectly balanced with seasonings, asparagus and a little bit of potatoes. My husband's tried four or five different pasties and loved them all.   We've even gotten them to go, and they're still great. We like bringing out-of-town friends here since it's a unique little place with great food and lots of character. I'd love to try one of the desserts, but I usually only finish half my dinner pasty and have no room!"}
{"text":"The food was good but this review is more for the amazing customer service we received from Casey! We had our 3yr old son with us and she made sure he also had a great experience, she brought him crayons, gave us food options even though they don't have a kids menu and even went around showing his drawing around the restaurant. His face lit up when she did that, I would come back just because of how great she was!"}
{"text":"Cutest place by ASU! and the food is to die for! The pesto chicken, spicy chicken and chicken alfredo are my favorites! My friend and I tried this place during our freshman year at ASU and habe been going back ever since. It's the definitiom of a hole in the wall and a great little gem."}
{"text":"I was turned on to this place a few months ago and I am hooked. The pasties are great. The lamb vindaloo is my favorite so far but I've still got my more to try.  They also have good beers on tap and quite a few bottles as well. Definitively worth trying."}
{"text":"Apparently the British invented the calzone.  Humanity should thank them because I would be surprised if you were to find a chicken pot pie or Vindaloo calzone in Italy.  Maybe you would be hard pressed to find these items in England, but the Cornish Pasty Company makes them available in the Valley of the Sun.  Variety is always good and I was happy to get something completely different than what is offered elsewhere for lunch in the Tempe area.  Just keep in mind that the restaurant is pretty small, so if you are going for a work-day lunch you should arrive before noon or well after the lunch rush to have a good chance grabbing a table without a wait."}
{"text":"What can I say? I absolutely adore this place. Its a local legend!  We shut it down every Tuesday and Thursday night in Grad School. The food is delicious and very unique. For Arizona, this place is a GEM. Everyone I take here loves it. There are 3 different locations now and they're all kinda special. All three can accomodate big crowds and the desserts are amazing. The Mesa location is in a great spot - and they stay open later than most places in Mesa. Scottsdale has a fantastic indoor/outdoor bar and Tempe is a great informal place to bring a huge group (with parking RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR!)  If you've never tried a pasty - you need to."}
{"text":"Love love love this great place.... Every time we go it's amazing and when you stuffed full the desserts are great to..."}
{"text":"Amazing. I have been to this place quite a few times. I do have to say I favor the classics over some of the more experimental ones, but don't take that as an insult to the experimental ones; this girl just likes some meat and potatoes. The only pasty I didn't like that I've had was the Royale with Cheese. The cheese was very stinky and very potent. Maybe you like stinky and potent cheese, though, and maybe it's for you. Phenomenal place."}
{"text":"Have to give 5 stars for Cornish Pasty! It used to be hard to get into this location as it was so tiny.  Now it's all expanded and plenty of room for everyone.  And that's a good thing as this place gets busy!  But the food is excellent - I usually vacilate between the Ruben, the Italian,  or the Royale with Cheese, but I have sampled many more and there are bound to be a few selections you will love!  I always realize it's been too long since my last visit when I go here!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pastis  in AZ (not that there are many places to find pasties). Decent craft beer selection, but you'll be fighting for a seat with University hipsters. So if you can look past their tattoos and huge gauge earrings, you'll get a great meal.  Btw, fewer university hipsters at their Mesa location"}
{"text":"Visited the Cornish pasty on a Monday night and seen how welcoming it was. However we decided to go to the basement bar and were met by Hannah Montana. She was the best and curated our drinks to our own taste. Hannah was very attentive and friendly and went out of her way to deliver us what we needed. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was a 5/5! We ordered a variety of pasty's and every one was great! Good beer selection also. Staff seemed a little overwhelmed the night we went, lowering the rating to 4/5 stars. But don't let that stop you from going! Must-try for Vegas food spots!"}
{"text":"Really bad lunch service for a downtown restaurant ..... my colleagues and I went for lunch and it was first come first serve seating . We were seated upstairs and no waiter or waitress came for about 15 minutes , so I decided to go find menus and a waiter . The waitress never came but a nice bartender came to take our drinks and order . So finally two if my colleagues had to leave after waiting for our order for more than an hour . We at that point called a manger and discussed our concern and then  WE had to tell them to comp us for our food ... I fee the manager should've of known to offer us that or come to our table to acknowledge the wait at least ... I am bummed to write this review because the food was very good . I will try again another time ."}
{"text":"Arrived at approx 6PM last Saturday evening. Was seated at a table.   The waiter looked at us a few times but never came over to see if we wanted to order.  Perhaps he thought we were just resting. Three other tables were seated after us and were served promptly. We waited about 15 minutes and left.  We were very disappointed because we really wanted to try out their food.  Won't be back because obviously they don't want us."}
{"text":"just had a great cottage pie pasty and brought home banoffee pie which I fear will have to wait until tomorrow. neat little spot unexpectedly tucked away in a pretty pedestrian shopping center. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was getting my race on at f1 race factory and decided to kick start my yelp search engine to find a nearby restaurant . So I  decided to eat here because of the high praise from the yelp community and it reminded me of the line in tropic thunder when he says pasty tea bag. By the way I recommend the movie as highly as I do this eatery. It was a chill laid back bar atmosphere. I've only had it the one time, but that was enough for me to be confident in saying 100% of the time its good everytime."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the Chicken Pot Pie pasty. This is my go to and I love pairing it with their wine options. Make sure when you go to visit the bottom floor for a drink."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here recently, they've expanded the dining space significantly, creating more of a dining experience (though I prefer to sit at the bar).  The food is consistently terrific--i've never been disappointed. I tried the oven chips for the first time and I'll be ordering those again. They have a good beer selection. The desserts are tasty and unique.   For first time visitors, I'd recommend The Oggie and a pint of the Hazelnut Brown from Oregon. Try the oven chips, or save room for dessert and order the Shirley Temple pudding. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of a pasty before but word of mouth for this place was insane. It's literally the talk of Vegas. The food is incredible. So different from all the average Vegas eateries. The staff is wonderful. Particularly Alexis. The place was packed and she seemed to be the only server working. She handled it so well and I was really pleased with my service. Definitely try the chicken pot pie and the Italian. Can't beat it. I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family. Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"Love,love,love! thats all I can say about the Cornish Pasty Company, My brother took me here  a while back and Ive been having cravings ever since,My favorite is the Mexican..its spicy and delicious,kind of tastes like an enchilada.....the best enchilada in the WORLD! but seriously if you havent tried this place out you need to go....like now! if I didnt live so far away I would be there right now gobbling down my mexican!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, the menu and bar are both varied and excellent.  i especially love the oggie and the rosemary chicken pasties, great.  The lamb and mint pasty is also recommended.  They've got hoegaarden, newcastle, and guinness on tap, and a decent selection of bottled imports.  Service is good, and nothing goes with an oggie better than some AC/DC."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with friends. The pasties are to die for! What a unique restaurant concept. I had the traditional pasty, and it was big enough for two. The drink menu is short but adequate. Service was fine, but not great."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I'll still come here for years to come, but this place is definitely not a four or five star restaurant.  First of all, sometimes the place just smells bad. While pasties were eaten by sweaty Cornish mine workers, there aren't any mines in downtown Tempe. We don't need to be that historically accurate. Secondly, everything is overpriced by a dollar or two.  While I've had some bad service here, that doesn't factor into my rating. As long as you keep my beers coming and as long as my pasty is there, I'm good. Just never remove the lamb and mint pasty from the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious - all of the pasties are great, and I really love the lamb vindaloo one. Ask for a little bit of cucumber and red onion on the side and nibble a little of each with every bite dipped in the yogurt sauce - perfect ^_^ I've been to this one and the one in Scottsdale; this one is great for date nights, while the other location is a little better for families. The food and beer at both are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place. But if I hear one more time \"oh we don't have that today\" or \"we're out\" I will not return to this location. I went a few days ago and was told that for 4 different items, I was like is this a joke? Then to have a waiter, who's just walking by with his \"I'm too apathetic for this place attitude nose in the air, says \"it's just food\"! Why yes, yes it is! BUT this is the 4th time our waitress has had to come tell us ummm sorry try again! Just keep walking next and keep your mouth shut.   Then today I call for a take out order for hubby and guess what?!? \"They're out\" no apologies, no explanation.  Nothin.   I understand they make them in batches blah blah blah - but this is your business you're hurting.   Don't worry got a delicious sandwich from Dillys Deli! They manage to keep their ingredients stocked. They ran out of a certain dressing for a particular sandwich and guess what?!? They got MORE! Novel idea."}
{"text":"Fast fact: Pastys were invented for miners in the 19th century.  At first, the place was a little quiet but people started trickling in and the atmosphere was great. It's family and adult oriented, as well as the perfect place to catch up with friends. I had the typical chicken pot pie (the gravy was amazing) and its actually quite filling. The lamb mint pasty was really savory (one of the more popular ones) and the red wine sauce complemented it well. For kids, the bangers and mash pie is ideal and for people who like the \"spice of life,\" the tikka masala is the one for you. All in all, I would definitely come back and this place is one of the hidden treasures of Las Vegas off the strip. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Someone at work had leftovers from here and it smelt awesome,  so we went that night. Very good! All four of us had something different and they were delicious. Two is us tried a cider and it was wonderful. The place is a bar/ pub for sure, not a restaurant, just so you know what you are getting into. We had 2 preteens with us, but it was fine, just dark. They have 2 desert pasties , but they were out of 1 and 1 of our kids has a nut allergy, so none for us."}
{"text":"Wonderful meat pies!  Reminded me of New Zealand!  Tasty and lots of food!  Will be a regular stop and I go through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I love love love love this place. I wish the one in downtown Phoenix was open, but driving all the way to Tempe is worth it for Cornish Pasty. The best thing about the food is that it's not just one type of cuisine you're stuck with. There are options that are Italian, Mexican, Indian, British, and others so you have the option to try something new each visit. I'm also thankful that they have so many vegetarian choices, seeing how I've noticed that many restaurants in the Valley rely way too much on meat products. The atmosphere is also pretty cool too, there's no obnoxious fluorescent lighting or anything and it is pretty intimate (in a good way) as well as the fact that there's always great music playing thanks to the employees. Extra points for having a full bar :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing and it's fairly inexpensive for what they serve you. Personally I live the unique atmosphere, but fair warning - it definitely has a college town vibe.   As far as food reccomendations go, you really can't go wrong. Pasties are to die for (obviously), but the soup is also a hearty meal for me (comes with fresh bread)."}
{"text":"AMAZING...I went here for my birthday last night...there were 6 of us...I had no idea that there were only a couple tables big enough to sit 6 people...but we were easily accommodated at the bar..which I prefer to sit anyways  You can see everything going on in the kitchen. I would imagine you would really have to like your co-workers here...working so closely in a small walkway of a kitchen.  The Pasty's are simply amazing, and there is one for everyone. I had the cheese steak..and it was spectacular!  This is a must go if you are in tempe!! The staff is amazing as well! Best service award for sure!  And with 6 people and 4 alcoholic beverages our bill was 83 dollars.... Almost unheard of!!  And finally ontop of all that.....they deliver to my house....yes they do...whatever Pasty I am in the mood for will be delivered right to my doorstep.  I think I am in love..."}
{"text":"Been twice, once in Mesa, once in Tempe. Both had great food and super friendly hipster staff. We will be back, no doubt! Good beer selection and happy hour deals too??"}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty. The atmosphere, the service, and the food are all wonderful! It does have a pub feel and can get a little loud with how busy it gets, so I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for a quiet dinner. The pasties are very nicely priced with how much food you get. Honestly, I usually take half of it home to eat later (if you do take it home, I'd recommend heating it up in the toaster oven). If you need pasty recommendations, I'd recommend the cajun, portobello mushroom, and cheese steak. The desserts are also delicious. So, in conclusion, come into Cornish Pasty and enjoy the world of classy hot pockets."}
{"text":"To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.  But then, today turned out to be a special day... I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?  It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.  So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm)."}
{"text":"I freaking loved this place. Food in pastry? You simply cannot go wrong. And since the portions are generous, my friend and I took 1/2 of our pasties home. Despite reheating it in the ghetto microwave at work the next day, it was still crazy delicious. We both came to the conclusion that Cornish Pasty Co. is a front for witchcraft because simple food shouldn't taste so good."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE. The beer and wine selection? Awesome. The cream of leek, potato, and stilton soup? Delicious. The chicken tikka pasty? Makes me believe that there is a god and that this pasty was sent down from heaven. Everything I've had off the menu is delectable. The lamb and mint pasty is also really good. I enjoyed the oven baked veggies in cheese sauce. I plan to come back here until I can try everything on the menu. Did I mention that the staff is really friendly and welcoming?"}
{"text":"So we came here for a nice meal. We had a party of about 13 people. We got in in a reasonable time considering there is no reservation.  However one of the people that ordered food in our group never received it.  Everyone was finished before they even acknowledged this.  It was handled very unprofessional. Because of this I will not be back."}
{"text":"The best pastys I have ever eaten. Sorry grandma and my mom...  My husband and I had the Cottage Pie and the Rosemary Chicken. The gravy with the Cottage Pie is to LIVE for. The garlic chips were really good but we wished we didn't order since we got too full for the pastys.   Place was super clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Amazing pasties (similar to a calzone or pot pie) with savory fillings. Cubano was delicious shredded pork with amazing homemade mustard. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like this place has good food and fresh at that. but, be warned and prepared to hear \"we are out, that sells so fast\" been here 4 times now and always get told one item I order is not available. Don't even consider asking for the \"Scotch Eggs\" they are always out of them. Shame, just think of the money they could make selling more ? Guess I feel a disclaimer should be on the menu not to be disappointed on a sold out item, but the food is good and I will return."}
{"text":"Great food, nice wait staff, and an awesome experience overall. Try the Chicken Tikka Marsala.  I'm not from Arizona so I went out in a limb trying this place but I'm glad I did.  Also the ambience won't be for everyone. It's kind of dark inside and the music is a mix of punk rock and some alternative jams."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio..awesome beers..awesome food (can't beat having your whole meal served in a hot pocket).  Garlic Frys are really good. . Music even better.   Must hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Always worth it. Everything is delicious, especially the peppered steak pasty. Get the oven chips with garlic. They also have great happy hour deals -- $3 Strongbow and $3 Irish car bombs."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pastry was really good. The service was good, but the atmosphere left a lot to be desired. Because they apparently don't have a fan or vent it is a little smokey and dark, the glass doors were dirty so when you enter you have to wonder about everything else. It just gives a bad first impression. It was not what I expected. The food was good, and I don't know of any place else to get a pastry other then Cornwell, England. I may order takeout, but too uncomfortable with the atmosphere to eat in again."}
{"text":"I couldn't help but think of the Jim Gaffigan \"Hot Pocket\" jokes when I went to lunch at Cornish Pasty Co. The pasty, the signature dish, is pretty much a gourmet Hot Pocket, which is made from scratch. There's an abundance of pastys you can order from like the Bangers & Mash or Chicken Alfredo. My favorite is The Royale with Cheese (hamburger meat, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon and cheddar served with a side of ranch, thousand island, ketchup or BBQ sauce)."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Amazing good food and kick ass beer/wine selection. Really great staff took care of us. Are new favorite spot in town."}
{"text":"What a find! Especially for a New Yorker, with no dining spot like this back home (but see below). Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.  Pasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.  Excellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50. What a deal.  For other New Yorkers reading this, I understand Myers of Keswick, a shop on Hudson Street, has Cornish Pasties and other meat pies. They're generally less than $4.00, so probably smaller and for takeout only. I'll give you an update on this next time I'm down in the Village."}
{"text":"I did like it better when it was just a little strip with just a few seats with a line out the door most nights, but the wait was definitely worth it. However, the new remodel and expansion looks very classy. The food is still totally worth it of course. Definitely one of my favorite places to go that is unique but very simple. You can't find a Cornish Pasty just anywhere!"}
{"text":"Man, my Yelp peeps did it again! We were in a food experimental mood so decided to check this place.  Boy, did it not disappoint!  The place looked a little \"shady\" weren't clear we were at the right place. Inside is dark, cool music, cool tables and staff. Our service was fast. We wanted for nothing. Our food was crazy good. Served to us piping hot! I ordered the Shepherds Pie and my husband ordered the A bit of Salmon. Dang good food. You owe it to yourself to eat here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very nice homey feel, with great selection of beer and pasties! Definitely plan on coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great pastry filled goodness. Had the Bangers and Mash. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Best Pasty I've ever had. Get the Oggie, have a beer, and enjoy the company."}
{"text":"This is the type of place you want to keep coming back and trying other \"Pasties\" this has only been the second time I've been but will go back the first time I had the \"Cajun Chicken\" it was great this time I had the \"Rosemary Chicken\" and it was just ok not enough flavor and a little dry but it still was good and it didn't turn me of from this place at all. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Ah, The Cornish Pasty. The food is so good, I would eat there even if I was treated like a total slob and the employees were all jerks. But the service is also really good. And great beers."}
{"text":"Delicious. Portions appear small until you get half way through, then it's difficult to finish. Heavy food fills the belly!"}
{"text":"I know they are known for their pasties, but the Chicken Tikka Salad is delish!   We've tried the Portabello, The Italian, The Bangers and Mash -- all are yummy.  The staff is always friendly.  We've had opportunity to sit at the bar, at the tables, and at the bar near the kitchen.   It's fun all the way around."}
{"text":"OK the business is small and very crowded at lunch but beyond that, They make the best food in Tempe, No Joke!  These Paste's are Hot Pockets on Steroids, from Cajun Chicken to the Original Lamb, these things are packed full of flavor and they serve the best beer as well.  So when your tired of Sushi, Pizza and a Steak dinner and you want something that is different but will get you coming back for more. Now they have a new location that is larger in Mesa on Dobson, that will surely be a hit too."}
{"text":"Service was awesome had a waitress that was very attentive and gave great recommendations! Leak soup by far one of the best soups I have ever tried. Very unique food but good"}
{"text":"I do not even know where to start with Cornish Pasty they have mastered the English food restaurant in this area. The ambiance is out of this world the food is to die for and the beer list is as good as it is long!. I have taken multiple parties here and enjoyed it every time. The Staff is possibly some of the coolest and most respectful and fun people i have ever have serve me and the owner will take the time to walk around and talk to you and his patrons. 5 Stars and that is a rarity!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of a calzone but the variety is much larger. Pub, but friendly for dinner or lunch also"}
{"text":"Went Saturday and got there just after opened at 11:00am as suggested by other yelpers. Glad we did as filled up quickly. Rate 4.5 stars as I'm a big fan of pub grub and atmosphere that goes with it. Would have been awesome if had a more brit/euro style feel by adding sports tele/bar music but that's being awfully picky, especially for such a small venue. Food was great, huge selection but could have been a tad warmer (my choice). Beer choices good, unfortunately out of my first pick but can't knock 'em too bad for that, and a bit warmer as well (again, my choice). Wait staff very friendly and efficient. Didn't have any unusual wait for service considering crowd. Prices I thought were reasonable, and we left full and satisfied. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place! The food it so good and the people who work there are super nice. The Tempe location can get pretty crowded and there aren't that many tables but  still highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pretty simple, you want a good pasty go here. They even have good beer. Yeah its cramped, but fun!"}
{"text":"Not only has everything I've had (in excess of a dozen dishes) been great, but the face-to-face bar atmosphere has made many of the employees friends on a first-name basis. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that they remember my name more often than I remember theirs! More than this antisocial nerd can say for most restaurants. Seriously this place is great, and open til midnight. The only way you'll possibly be disappointed is if you hate pasties, soups, and salads, or if you hit them at the peak of rush hour. Why haven't you tried it yet? GET GOING! They're probably still open!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place last night. Food was really good! Neighborhood is sketchy as hell, but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. This spot makes me question all the negativity I've heard over the years towards British food; it's all BS folks. This spot is great. I ordered the original oggie, an iron maiden beer, and toffee bread pudding for dessert. The steak in the oggie was seasoned with the right amount of pepper and complimented the gravy and flaky crust perfectly. Not a huge beer drinker but this was pleasant: malty with hints of citrus. I friggin' loved the dessert; not too sweet and delicious with the vanilla ice cream.   The atmosphere varies based on where you sit or what you're in the mood for, e.g. downstairs = romantic date?, upstairs = play time with billiards &/or darts, and plenty of bar seating. You gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome. Comfortable atmosphere. Great food. Great wine and beer list. Everyone here is always nice and inviting. Being able to see the kitchen is a plus.   But let's get back to the food... They have so much variety, what ever your in the mood for you can find something that matches. So good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to have a going away dinner with a bunch of coworkers because we work at a restaurant nearby. TERRIBLE service. Absolutely horrible. I have never felt so unwelcome before in a restaurant in my entire life. Every person I encountered was rude to me. I sat down and was never offered anything, never even got water! I tasted a friend's pasty and wasn't very good. A slightly better hotpocket really.  After telling a friend about how bad the service was, she told me she also got horrible service and got food poisoning after eating there a few weeks earlier.  Needless to say, I'll NEVER step foot in there again !"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Friendly, bright staff, owners on site in a nicely redone space next to Komol at Commercial Center. Great center bar surrounded by custom made benches. Very nicely done old school pub feel with great bluesy rock tracks played in the background  at a decent volume. We sampled all four soups made in house, and recommend them all. Comes with housemade bread and butter too. The pasty choices are numerous and we couldn't decide, so we started at the top with the original Oggie. Steak, potato and rutabaga in a pastry crust baled to perfection with a red wine sauce that pops nicely. One cup of soup and one pasty shared between us and we didn't have room for dessert. Total 12.97 - just try to beat that."}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a pasty.  Fairly quick service in a rustic atmosphere.  The primary seating is kitchen-adjacent, and they serve you on metal plates.  However, don't let the rustic atmosphere fool you, the food is top-notch."}
{"text":"Wow. As a true pastie loving Englishman I was curious to see how this place stacked up. And I must say it was utterly fantastic! I had the Reuben pastie and it was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten. The staff were friendly, plenty of parking and the food delicious, and I would recommend this place to everyone. I had took it to go so can't comment on the beer, but I suspect it's also brilliant."}
{"text":"4th time us and not the last.  Excellent food and service.  Casey was outstanding server.  Pasties r the greatest."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very dark and you feel almost closed in.  But the food makes up for it. The greek salad and the tikka masla is really good.  The workers are all tatted up and seem kinda unshowered.  The happy hour has good car bomb specials."}
{"text":"Ordered the Rosemary Chicken for my first Pasty experience. I was really impressed. Filling, tasty, and unique.   A few hiccups, the drafts were not in working order. I do believe they may be epanding this location because it's rather small. The other bottle beer my table ordered, they were out of too.   One other side note, there are NO substitutions. You get what you get and you don't throw a fit!  I'm not an onion fan at all, so my choices were pretty limited, but as I stated up top, the ROSEMARY CHICKEN did the trick for me!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of pasties, I've had about 12 different types and haven't had one I dislike.  Beer selection is great.  Car bombs for $3, Mickeys for $2...great deal."}
{"text":"The pasties here are amazing. The carne adovada was stuffed with super delicious and moist pork. Love the layer of rice, the green pepper and cheese. So perfect. Good service, cold drinks and awesome food. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in Tempe. I would eat a pasty from this place every day, no joke. They have a wide variety of pasties from more traditional ones like Shepherds Pie or Bangers & Mash (my two favorites besides the Cajun Chicken) to The Mexican or Chicken Alfredo. I usually get a pasty, some oven chips, and a Strongbow (which they almost always have on tap). This has been a favorite place for my group of friends to meet and catch up at for years now. I've never once had a bad experience at this place. Plus, great music! (;"}
{"text":"Wicked good food, very convenient, great beer selection.  What's good here?  It's more like what's not good here?  Nothing comes to mind, honest.  The one thing the food is not, though, is light, though they do have salads, if you're concerned.  But then you'd miss out on that excellent buttery pasty dough.  fyi...pasties (pronounced pass-tees) are calzone-like meals, with much richer dough and almost anything you can imagine inside.  There's a huge vegetarian selection too."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here, this time lunch, last time dinner. Both times food was perfect! I have had a few different items , all have been good. Love the atmosphere.  Love the vibe.  The parking is an issue FYI, but with food like this, who cares. Beers on tap,  with a great selection for anyone who loves beer. Chill place. It's a must go."}
{"text":"Fantastic !!!  My son had raved about the food! He is so correct. The leek potato soup out outstanding.  The chips are sooo good!!!  Then the pasty!  OMG !! I could eat here everyday !  Love the location !! Don't ever change !!"}
{"text":"So happy to find the Cornish Pasty in Tempe. We love our Las Vegas location. Food and service is fantastic. Plus a guy at the bar took us under his wing and helped us to find a table."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a pasty and a english beer then this is the place to go in Las Vegas.  I had the peppered steak. It was not frozen and was made to order. The flavor profile was a little off for me but I should have known that when I ordered, the peppered steak comes with melted Stilton and the Stilton was just a little bit overpowering and too earthy for me. Although I love blue cheese I would have probably been better suited with the cheese steak.  However, other than that the pasty was great! perfectly cooked and the bread was cooked on the outside with hot filling on the inside - think a deluxe hot pocket.   My only complaints were that the waitress was nice but a little dense and incredibly slow. She didn't bring the happy hour cider I requested and brought a larger size at a larger price - but larger cider really shouldn't be a point of contention I suppose. Also, for the $9ish I would have liked to see the pasty come with a side, fries or something else.    We also bought the garlic fries. They didn't taste fried but more like the oven fries I make at home (my attempt to bake fries to be healthy which hopefully offsets the copious amounts of french fries from fast food places I eat). The problem with what appeared to be baked or crisped fries was that the garlic on the outside was burnt. Maybe they should put the garlic on after they cook the fries to avoid this problem.   Two pastys, four beers and fries came to about $44. Steep for lunch but I suppose not bad considering the four beers. They also have a decent english/irish beers on tap and many more in bottles.   Suprisingly for a  pub in the commercial center, they were not smoky and they had a child seat, which means children are welcome! They had a few larger booths so groups of 4 or more could come here as well.   I hope they make it but they are not what you would expect for the commercial center. I think that they would be much more suited in a more prominent area as a new business."}
{"text":"I'm am a big fan of Cornish Pasty. Sometimes I go a long time without visiting, and then I over do it by going 2-3 times in a month. The Oggie is obviously the easy OG, but I've tried the Pilgrim, the Cottage Pie, the Peppered Steak and the Bangers & Mash -- they're all yummy and a great delivery method for the delicious red wine sauce. I also really like the Pasta Salad w/ Sausage (not to be mistaken for the sausage salad which I haven't tried yet). Definitely one of my favorite AZ eateries."}
{"text":"We went for late dinner, near closing -- no problem, staff was excellent. Food was rich, outdoor ambiance in lovely neighborhood at night, all completely satisfying. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, cool venue.  Had the Greek pasty, crust was baked perfect, fillings fresh and flavorful.  Side of cheese broccoli and cauliflower - again baked perfectly, perfect blend of cheese, breadcrumbs and sauce.  The Chocolate bread and butter pudding with anglaise was a phenomenal dessert to end with."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. Free pool, darts, and shuffle. Excellent interior with church pew seating and lots of beer on tap. The only downside is that they don't serve anything that's gluten-free. A+ on all accounts."}
{"text":"Did a lunch there and had a couple of things off their Veggie Menu and it was delicious.  My mouth is watering as I remember how good it was.  The shopping center it's in is run down but the Cornish Pasty is pretty inside.  Not a huge place but that makes it cozy and humble.  Will definitely be back and recommend this place to all my foodies!"}
{"text":"Really good food and very authentic. The Oggie pasty was amazing loved that it had rutabaga/suede. They have so many flavors will def be returning. The oven chips and leek and Stilton soup are def worth a return trip for. Service was excellent and very helpful esp with beer menu as there were many I've never heard of or tried..Crabbies ginger beer was a great find I'm going to be buying some for my fridge ASAP. Ask for Maddie she was great :)!"}
{"text":"Dear Cornish Pasty, you live up to your hype. You win.   I have been wanting to try Cornish Pasty Co. for some time, but I honestly thought it was just hyped up on yelp. I mean, it's just a hot pocket...right? WRONG. First off, their menu does not just consist of pasties. They have a handful of salads that looked delicious and sides. I started with a cup of their potato leek soup. The flavors were so intense and rich. I enjoyed every spoonful. I also tried the mushroom walnut spinach and that was also beyond delicious. Finally it came time to select our pasty. This time I split the asiago chicken. Trust me, splitting was a good choice. I don't think I could finish one on my own. The asiago chicken was full of flavor. It was spicier than I expected, but the sour cream dulled the heat. Nevertheless, it was delicious.   We ran out of time so we didn't get to try dessert, but that is just another reason to come back."}
{"text":"So before I moved to manage the new Sack's location on the west side, I had put in my time at the University & Hardy locale-- putting the Cornish Pasty Co. in ridiculously close proximity to myself and the other happy hour enthusiasts I happened to work with.  I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.    So if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.    Managing a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.    Parting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs! (I've seen places charge $6!!!). Oh, and don't forget the Banoffee Pie for dessert.  They make their own whip cream!"}
{"text":"My favorite pasty has been, and always will be, the vegetarian chicken tikka masala. This is not to say that I don't enjoy the other pasties - because I do, very much. But I'll always love the Tikka. The filling tastes like it was made by a short and plump Indian woman, not the tattooed hipsters behind the bar. (I'm okay with that.)  The beer selection is great - including the brews on tap. Plus, $3 car bombs, always. $9-15 bucks later you're feeling like a champion, depending on your alcohol tolerance.   If you show up with more than two people, plan on waiting a little for a table, or just sit at the bar. But you will enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place through a friend who works/hangs there and now my guy and I are here regularly. Free pool & jukebox, everything on the menu is good but beware: the Tempe location is loaded with college kids so head to one of the other locales if that age group isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times and love their food. Living in california i come here at least once a month. Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked.   I sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.   Areas for improvement  The waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips.   They need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal!   Drinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins  Notification on food times (depends on who is working)   Challenge your servers to turn tables faster   Servers need to be smiling and social"}
{"text":"2nd review... I have been here over 6 times in 2 months and everything is always wonderful. The carne adovada and the tikka masala are literally TO DIE FOR FOR UNDER $10.00  If you haven't had lunch here you are making a mistake   If you haven't brought a date here, you are missing out and so is your date.  Fix it- go there. Live it, love it, eat it."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat at! The menu is very unique and the Pasties were very good! The mushroom soap with walnuts was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Located in Commercial Center, their appearance seems to want to scare people away. But go there and eat and drink. I tried the regular Cornish pasty, and the sausage and mash pasty. Both are excellent, pastry is light and delicious. One is enough for a meal. Firestone IPA on draft, what more could anyone want."}
{"text":"I ain't from around here. Where I come from,  restaurants located in strip malls are not to be trusted. \"Feed me but be careful.\" Speaketh my hangover and we rolled back the stone to the pasty-cave.  So the hangover and I find ourselves inside the pit as The Soledad Brothers play and smoke rises from the narrow kitchen. Ten pounds of onion simmer on a grill.  A beautiful woman hands me a menu. Oh god, they are everywhere! That man making the food has an immaculate beard!!! Am I in Chicago?! What's happening hangover?!    No. I'm In Tempe, where there is a kickass restaurant that serves kickasser beer, and great comfort food to cure what ails you. Bangers and Mash. Mmmm. Mash."}
{"text":"Had a great meal prepared by Laurel. Sat at the bar  and got to watch all the prep work and ask questions. What a great place to eat. Steve"}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere pubish, beer selection very good. Value for money just fine. So why not 5 stars? Because the service while mechanically ok just did not make us feel welcome (actually my wife used the word \"rude\" which I think is a wee bit too strong).  We're not difficult to please, a little bit of personality, smile, cordial gesture, even just moderate sense of humor from the waiter would do just fine to make us feel warm and fuzzy, welcomed and appreciated. Instead it felt like a factory, impersonal service, hurried, bang bang... Maybe we just showed up on a bad night when they were short staffed or didn't feel like talking to strangers on Sunday night - but frankly that's not my problem. Guys - try service with a smile, it works."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome here and customer service is great!  I always get the Shepard's pie with ground beef.  This location is very convenient for me since I live right down the road.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago on a cool rainy day a friend and I were thinking of a place to grab lunch.  He asked me what I was in a mood for and I said \"some place cozy\".    With his awesome mind reading skills he figured I meant a place that had soup, hot sandwiches, and a relaxed atmosphere.  Cornish Pasty Co. was just the place!  Great food and they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"I've been here once, and the one time I went here, the wait for our food was really long. It took about 30-45 minutes just to get our food. And they said they weren't allowed to add or take out anything from the pasties. I am not a fan of onions or tomatoes so I wasn't able to get the one I wanted because it had both of those ingredients in there. Otherwise, the waiter was nice and the PBJ Dessert pasty is delicious."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place, right here on Yelp, while searching for places to find good soup. It's right next door to Komol Restaurant in the Commercial Center.  I had a great cup of tomato soup with homemade bread (and real butter) while watching the rain outside, last Saturday night.  I also had their version of chicken pot pie which is one of my favorite foods ever. It was great, different than what I expected but still very tasty and almost too much to eat. I'm going back soon if for no other reason to get some more soup."}
{"text":"My brother convinced me to come here and I'm so glad I did! I had the lamb shepherds pie pasty! It was ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Cornish Pasty Company since shortly after they opened, and I've been consistently impressed.  Their menu is constantly expanding, and every single pasty I've tried has been amazing.  ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.  The owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.  What they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.  What they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)  Overall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT.  Not only is the vibe and atmosphere so much fun but the beer and food is one of a kind. Some friends and I wandered in this little hidden gem late on a Thursday night. The expanded back room is lined with old church pews and community style tables. Walls are decorated with large canvas photographs of old miners digging deep, naturally. I order a Strongbow and my brother ordered a fancy beer that came in a mug so big it had a lip to drink out of. Very cool. It feels very much like an Irish pub or a gastropub because it is so tucked away and no where close to a bar scene.  We order The Royal with Cheese pasty, the Rueben pasty, the Mint and Lamb pasty and an Asiago Chicken pasty. To say that everyone was 100% satisfied at the end of their meal would be an understatement. I would HIGHLY reccommend this place to anyone and I will be going back."}
{"text":"I understand why people say it's a hole in the wall, however no negative connotation should be attached to that statement. [UPDATE] - they moved! Their space is really nice, updated and somewhat reminiscent of their first location. Check it out!  The food comes out fresh and piping hot! I had the Shepherds pie pasty with minted lamb, I felt like I was back in the country in the U.K. My husband had the royale with cheese. I think it was gone in five minutes! If you want to go seriously traditional, get the Oggie (hope I spelled that correctly).   We also ordered the chips with garlic and jalapeños. My only complaint is the jalapeños wouldn't stay on the chips, they fell off. I think a solid solution would be to add a bit of cheese. They were cooked to perfection too.  Their beer is only served in proper imperial sizes: 8 oz. or 20 oz. yay! They do serve Boddington however I suggest trying some of their other options on tap.  Service was very friendly. A little slow, however I'm not complaining one bit. Merely observing. I'll return to try all the pasty's."}
{"text":"Finally, after months of hearing people rave about this place and it constantly popping up on Yelp with fantastic reviews, I went to the Cornish Pasty for lunch with a coworker.   The whole time I felt so confused by the good reviews.  The service was terrible- they acted like we should have known to seat ourselves and weren't friendly or helpful, but doing the bare minimum assuming we'd been there before.  I'd never had a pasty before, and I was not impressed.  I got the philly cheesesteak which the waiter informed was nothing like an actual philly cheesesteak.  As far as my experience goes, they include steak, cheese, mushrooms, peppers- all of which were also in the pasty.  The difference was, this steak was chewy and flavorless, I didn't taste any cheese, and there were more green peppers than any other ingredient.  The pastry part was good,  but undercooked.    I was excited that they had specific sauces to pair with each pasty.  The server allowed me to try both- a mustard one and a red wine one.  I found both to be gross and a terrible combination with the pasty.   I just want to emphasize that I am not a picky eater and enjoy most food.  I was extremely disappointed that I spent money there.  Neither me nor my coworker finished our food and the waiter looked at us oddly when we didn't want to take the rest to go. No thanks. We were both totally confused by why people rave about this place.  Perhaps it is the good beer they serve..."}
{"text":"i am so pissed at my friends, they always recommended this place but they didn't tell me they pretty much serve nothing but bomb ass homemade hot pockets. Amazing beer selection, kind of dark inside but I like it that way. Got the Shepard's Pie Pasty, it was absolutely amazing, especially with their red wine gravy."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Tempe.  Cornish has been a favorite of mine for years now and I'm fortunate to live so close to the Tempe location. The beer and drink selection is great and a pasty is just near impossible to beat. The staff is always attentive and funky.  People of Tempe, we are fortunate to have such a place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Try the PB&J Dessert Pasty.  Amazing.  Wonderful, happy staff.  Clean and efficient operation.  The Peppered Steak pasty is my favorite."}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting food in Tempe. Its like mouth watering delicious. I haven't been there in a long time, and I forgot how damn good it is... Its like every bite you are in heaven.   I dont go here often because I tell myself $10 is too much for just one item, I wish it would come with a side. But thinking about it, its like $2 more than you would pay for something else at like say Chipotle. So its totally worth the extra $2 to get something you cant get anywhere else, that tastes 10 times better than anywhere else.  The beer menu is nice to, and with the expanded patio, I will go there again for happy hour, or a late night on the patio for a Lagunitas."}
{"text":"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.  What is a pasty?  A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the \"handles\" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.  At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.  Pros * Good food * Originality * Portions * Customer service * Coat hooks at the bar  Cons * Small interior"}
{"text":"Don't be scared. The food is amazing and the service is great. The beer selection is unique. I wouldn't change a bit about this place. It's the perfect amount of divey with something amazing coming out of that kitchen. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened.  It's always reminded me of the narrow downtown bars found up in Seattle, not sure why.  Love the food though.  If I'm feeling cheap, I'll get the Oggie & a Mickey's.  On good days, the Lamb and Mint & a Smithwicks.  The owner is a beer lover for sure, don't go here if you want cheap domestic (Bud & Miller).  Try a good English or German brew instead."}
{"text":"The food was great - I had the veggie mexican and it was really good.  Plenty to eat - in fact I brought half home.  The service wasn't great but I would good back because the food was good."}
{"text":"I found it funny that my friend who comes here frequently still can't pronounce \"pasty\" (or \"hipster hot pockets,\" as my friends and I like to call them), but after tasting one of these, you could call it anything and it would still be delicious.  I don't know why it took so long for me to return to Cornish Pasty Co., especially since I live so close to it, but after chowing down a delectable, flaky shepard's pie pasty and washing it all down with a frosty pint of Hoegaarden, I know my trips will be much more frequent.  Sure, it's friggin' small and hot in there, but after you start eating, you pretty much forget about the temperature and you're floating in pasty heaven. And if you're looking to get into some shenanigans, which we were last Friday night, Irish car bombs are 3 bucks all day, everyday. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"I have been wowed! We had the bangors and mash, the pot pie and caramel apple pasties. I have never enjoyed eating a pasty in my life. I not only enjoyed this but loved it! The meats and vegetables are fresh. Everything is made there. Perfect balance of ingredients and a great dough. The prep area behind the bar was great to watch. They have this down to a science. Everyone there was extremely nice. I saw the great reviews and decided to give it a shot. we were not disappointed. I love this place and I wish I lived here but I must fly home. If I get to visit Arizona again, I am defintely coming back here. As mentioned by others (thanks for the heads up) the gps will take you to the front of the block but you must drive down the side of the shopping center to find it on the cross street side (behind gas station)."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beer and amazing pasties! All of the starters are tasty also. The atmosphere is nice and sitting on the patio is really great. The servers could be way better. They seem lazy and half the time you have to go find one of them to get anything. When you ask for something, they look like you are putting them out. The runners and bartenders are all helpful and polite though.    Please hire better servers! You food is delicious and I often avoid coming here because the service is so awful."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great options for vegan and vegetarian. Atmosphere was just the right amount of hipster for us and the service was good."}
{"text":"We love this place! Three floors to choose from, lots of comfortable nooks to sit in. Couches are awesome and the music is even better! The best pasties are the Reuben and the Lamb Vindaloo. Ask the servers for sauce suggestions. They know them well and the combinations they suggest are always delicious. This has quickly become one of our favorite spots for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, but even if everything else on their menu was inedible (it is always delish) their toffee pudding would keep me coming back for more.  The pasties are deceptively filling.  Always best to share so you have room for dessert.  Or you can do what we often do...order the pasties par-baked to take home for \"left-overs\" and just have the dessert for your meal.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Mesa location twice and visited the Tempe location last night for the first time. I think I like the Mesa restaurant slightly better -- maybe because it's bigger. But we had great service in Tempe (and Sunday happy hour lasts all day).   Hubby and I shared the asiago chicken pasty and the eggplant parm pasty. Very different from each other. Both exceptional in taste. Haven't had a bad meal here yet.   Now, if they could just do breakfast with a bacon, egg, cheese, tomato, avocado pasty, where the bacon stays crisp? That would be the ultimate food item."}
{"text":"All of the food here is great, but THE VEGETARIAN COTTAGE PIE IS TO DIE FOR!!! Super cool environment. Great vibes. All-around awesome place to hang out/eat/enjoy."}
{"text":"Great little place. There is not much seating AT ALL but it somehow adds to the charm of a little British hole in the wall place. Great beers as well!  I thought my fav was the Spicy Asiago Chicken but last time I got the Carne Adovada and it knocked my socks right off.   The pasties are pretty big too, and for $9 to have a half leftover for tomorrow (even tasty reheated, I can attest!), that is a-ok with me!   Not a lot to say other than I really like this place and am always down for a patsy. Er, pastie. Er, PASTY!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place worth the trip to Tempe. OK food, OK tap, OK service. OK atmosphere. Been back three times so far and will go back again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's food in a pastry crust...who wouldn't love that? And the food is so good! Plus the portions are really big. I had the chicken tikka masala pastie and it was the perfect amount of spice. It wasn't overwhelming at all. Also, they have really good beers. The pasties and beers are the perfect combination. The restaurant is big so there is plenty of seating and the service is great! But seriously, what really makes this place amazing is their pasties....they are out of this world! It's a place that you need to check out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Everyone else Yelping about Cornish Pasty has already said it, so let me just echo the resounding chorus:  Pasty is the best.  The beer selection is beyond compare (plus, 3 dollar \"car-bombs?\"  YR KIDDING ME), and the food is amazing.  They can make vegan pasties if you call an hour ahead, so don't let dietary choices stop you from stopping in an enjoying the great service, dimly lit decor, and wonderful drinks.  Yeah, it's crowded, so if you're with a large group, you might have to wait to get the back table (it's worth it).  Certainly in the running for my favorite place in Tempe.  Top 3 pasties-  Peppered Steak the Mexican the Classic Oggie"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The staff is not only friendly, but just plain cool. The vibe is like a really great bar-- but without the nasty , disgusting, cigarette smoke. Then there's the food-- delicious! And so much to choose from including plenty of veggie and vegan options, a fantastic dessert menu, and a huge variety of beers. I'll be back. A lot."}
{"text":"http://www.cornishpastyco.com/  Its whats for dinner....had potato leek soup and chicken pesto pasty. Loved it so much got a Pilgrim for.the next days lunch, and a cinnamon apple w/vanilla ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"In addition to the food the STAFF here is AMAZING. I have been coming to this establishment for at least 3 times a week for a year and have NEVER heard anyone including Kayla say anything offensive and I am not sure why Mystic H.  is so up set but I believe her statement is completely false. Oh and thank you for insulating the windows. :)"}
{"text":"YUM!!  I had the shepherd's pie and it was the perfect blend of meat, mashed potatoes, and veggies.  It didn't even really need the side of gravy, that was just a bonus.  The dough is perfect.  Wide variety of pasties to choose from and some very interesting combinations.  One pasty is very big and will fill you up.  Mine was so good I wanted to eat the whole thing, but luckily I exercised some restraint.  Please come to Southern California."}
{"text":"cool spot, interesting tables and pews.  Never even knew what a pasty was before I went here.  It was good.  good beer.  I liked it.  Its a good place to take someone from out of town for lunch."}
{"text":"Ehhhh... The reviews made me try it... The bad service made me leave early. Food wasn't anything special, lots of bread surrounding mediocre fillings. Would not go back. Seems to be a place people go to be \"trendy\""}
{"text":"I really like the food at Cornish Pasty Co.  I have brought friends and colleagues and all have enjoyed it as well.  They have quite a few vegetarian options and even a vegan pasty option.  The service is always good, the prices are fair and the atmosphere comfortable.  My favorite pasty is the chicken with pesto.  If you are feeling guilty about leaving your significant other home, you can always get a partially baked pasty to go.  Please support this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for a nice little unique dinner and we got just that! The pasties are simple but full of great flavor. He had the carne adobada while I tried the greek (veggie-friendly option). We were both pretty impressed. Beer selection was pretty solid. Overall, we had a great time and would come back again.  Entrance is kind of odd, just a heads up."}
{"text":"the service is not very good - we've waited 20 minutes and left without getting so much as a water.  now that you can't smoke on the porch, there's no reason to come here, even though the food is pretty good, because it is just that, pretty good."}
{"text":"The environment and atmosphere was great. However, I found a long string of hair in my dish. Noticed all the employees behind the kitchen rarely had any coverage on hair. I would suggest to implement requiring hair nets including coverage of beard for sanitary purpose. I was given a freshly made batch of my order though and it was expedited in a timely manner. I would still come back if they implement a better sanitary procedure with hair coverage."}
{"text":"I love this place and try to eat here regularly. To be fair, you sort of have to know what you're getting yourself into before you try your first time here. This one is the divey-est of all the locations, and with that said, I love it. It is fairly dark on the inside at all times of the day, but hey - that's why there's the outside. Or sit by a light. It's a simple obstacle to overcome. The service can also take a little longer than most other places, but the servers are generally pretty nice and I've never had a problem with any orders or anything like that.   The food is great, the beer selection is pretty rad, and don't forget about the carbombs!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit to the Cornish Pasty Co., two different locations. Today, the Pasties were good, service ok. My complaint was how very dark at 1:30 pm and how incredibly loud the music was.    I think it would be better to order to go and enjoy the good food at home."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I had the bangers & mash, my boyfriend had the Oggie & we shared the scotch egg & cheese bake. Great wine, beer & excellent service made for an outstanding evening. We even bought a couple part baked pasties to take home. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the vibe is super chill. I'd use any excuse to come here and enjoy the huge selection of drinks and yummy food. (Chicken Alfredo pastey is bomb)"}
{"text":"Just happened upon the Cornish Pasty Company and what a great surprise.  Bar atmosphere is relaxing and felt no need to rush, but rather enjoy friends.  The unique, creative food starting with the classics was to fall in love with.  Will definitely be returning often as it is not far from my home."}
{"text":"It doesn't help that I live across the street from this place, but I love it.   My favorite thing from this place is the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Cream of Leek Soup, and The Italian. I love the Banoffee Pie (oh my god that caramel layer) and Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding, though I can't finish it in one sitting because it is so rich.  One of my favorite places. I love their outside sitting area, beats the inside if you want a quieter and intimate setting.   Wait times can be a little off-putting; sometimes the waiters/waitresses forgets to check on tables because it's open sitting and tucked away.   But, I like this place."}
{"text":"The food here is so great!   It's comfort food at its best and a great list of beers and cocktails as well.  I didn't really know what to expect but my companions and I found the place to be a hidden gem.  Look forward to going again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale, Mesa and this location and this is one I won't return to. For one, the food isn't as good as the other locations. We ordered wings there and the blue cheese sauce was sour... I'm pretty sure it was spoiled and would have told our server had we seen her around but she was no where in sight and we where the only people there. My Greek salad was good but my husband didn't care much for his pasty which at the other two locations he loves. The place is dirty over all as well with no place to park."}
{"text":"I agree that the service is a hit or miss, but the food itself does justice. The Shepherd's Pie and the Italian should not be missed. I've done take out here a few times and the food is just as good eaten at home as when you eat it at the restaurant. Solid 4 stars from me for their limited, but specialized menu!"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!!!! Just.... not the space. SO small and always packed results in either a long wait or us leaving to find a different place to eat. However, the food and service is always excellent. If you've never had a pasty before, you need to go and try one. They are very filling and every different kind I've tried, has been excellent. If you don't know what it is, think of it as like a larger, tastier & fresher hot pocket. I normally stick with \"The Oggie\", \"Bangers & Mash\" or \"Cottage Pie\". All 3 are excellent. I also request an extra side of their red wine gravy. Its amazing!  Don't be scared off when you walk in to find dark walls, dim light and rock music playing. Nor the servers & chef's with tattoos and piercings... because you could easily miss out on one hell of a meal.  (I'd like to add that if you want to avoid the small, dark space with limited seating, you can always try out their other location off Dobson & Guadalupe)."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough. I absolutely love the red pepper bean soup kicked up with a little habanero. The pastys are quite filling and savory. For me, I normally need a buddy to finish the other half of these monsters. They've quite a few options for the vegetarian and vegans in your party. Beer selection is one of the best around featuring quite a few local breweries as well as more traditional British choices. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I'll come here alone or with a group of friends and they're always accommodating.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"After driving round a decidedly shady parking lot,  we finally found the Cornish Pasty Co. That I had been looking forward to visiting since I heard about it nearly two months ago, I repeatedly asked myself \"what the hell am I doing here?\" Driving away,  however,  the question on my lips was \"why the hell did I wait two months to visit this place?\" Upon arriving,  my wife and I stayed ourselves on the church pew benches that line the walls of this dark and atmospheric bar.  The hipster-esque barman took our beer order,  and I was a little disappointed when he said the boddingtons was all gone,  with no equivalent substitute available. I plumped for the kronenburg 1664, which went down very nicely.   When it came to ordering food,  I asked for the scotch egg,  which, like the boddingtons,  it appeared that demand had exceeded supply.   My wife got the cottage pie pasty, and I opted for the lamb.  I should tell you that being an Englishman, and a trained chef,  my expectations were quite high. I know good pies and pasties when I eat them, and I have to say that both mine and my wife's were as good as any I've eaten.  Mine was moist with tender chunks of juicy lamb,  perfectly cooked potatoes and light crispy, crusty pastry. The red wine gravy that accompanied it was slightly sweet and very rich,  which complimented the subtle mint that fragranced the lamb.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed the cottage pie pasty, being of Irish decent. It was apparent that the lamb mince was of excellent quality,  lacking the grittiness that often spoils similar dishes. The cheddar cheese was very mature, giving the pasty a hearty, deep flavor.   We ordered the mushy peas(which in my opinion would have been even better with some chunks of ham)  and the oven chips(which tasted very similar to the ones I make at home).  Altogether I was throughly impressed with the quality of the food,  and although slightly disappointed with the items they didn't have,  and the kinda steep bill,  I will definitely be back. And will certainly order them to bake myself at home."}
{"text":"Hands down on this place. The best pasty I ever had. I keep on coming back to this one.  A must try if you are in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co. is fantastic -I'm giving the long story short here. Driving into the old strip mall was fun unto itself. Took a left instead of a right, and ended up driving past The Green Door. \" Ummmm...?? Where are we?!\" Lol!   We came in on a Sunday night and sat down right away. I noticed the bigger tables benches were actually church pews. We ordered beers all around and took a look at the menu. My English hubby was very excited to try this place obviously, so he took longest on deciding what he wanted. We ordered a vegetarian Greek, an Oggie, a Pilgrim, a Bangers & Mash, a Lamb Vindaloo, a side of mushy peas, and some oven chips. Tried their banoffee pie and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Everyone was very happy with their choices; so without boring you with wordy descriptions, you basically can't go wrong here! I took half my dinner home as I was so full. The desserts were ok, I'd likely pass next time.   We're looking forward to coming back to try more things, as well as taking English friends and family when they're in town.    **Moment of caution on the lamb vindaloo... Its tasty, a tad spicy, and you'll smell the curry from your pores the day after. I went running this morning, and was confused as to why I was smelling curry....?  Haha!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday...decent crowd for a late lunch.  Had the Adovada Pasty and it was very good.  Could have been a little hotter, but the flavor was good.  Salsa is homemade and very good.  CJ, the bartender was very nice and helpful too."}
{"text":"First time for me and my husband. We both had Shepard Pie. One  with lamb  one with ground beef. It was excellent. The potato leek soup was the best I've ever had. Our server was very pleasant. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys pub food."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  I highly recommend the pasta salad or the cottage pie.  Huge beer selection, hip staff."}
{"text":"The food was great however the service was very unwelcoming upon arrival. We had ten in our party and the waitress left us all to look at two menus. She walked around in a stoned stupor with other similar coworkers offering little help."}
{"text":"First time here. Dillon was an amazing server.  From the Moment we walked in till we had eaten too much to function properly. Good food, amazing service. Come if you're in the area, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Multiple delicious vegan options, as well as vegetarian ones! Delicious crust (not greasy), stuffed full of delicious vegetable combinations! Even the plain salad was the freshest and crispest I've eaten in a restaurant in a long time! It had an incredible lemon-pesto (vegan) dressing. High quality, truly delicious food at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Go here. This is one of my friends and I's favorite places, always fun for a night out, lunch or dinner. We've been going for a few years now and with all of my friends, I'm sure we've tried everything on the menu, or just about. Some favorites are the Cajun, the Spicy Asiago, the Philly, though the list could go on about as long as their menu. Beers good. Car bombs are great for those crazier nights. Love love love this place (though the new Mesa location is larger and more comfortable)."}
{"text":"Today, 9/11 was a perfect day to come bc everything was free! SCORED! Since they will be relocating to a new location, they made today customer appreciation day. Awesome sauce! Thank you Jesus. The outside doesn't look all that great, but as you walk in the inside is pretty cool. There's no smoking, which is awesome! It's sort of dark inside, but that's nothing. We started with this beer called Boot Amber Ale & it's oh so good. For starters, we got the Scottish eggs & oh my gawd, so delish!! I got the oggie, holy crap, so delicious!!! My hubby got the lamb & mint he said it's very good. The Oggie is the best. So tender with meat & potatoes. The pastry is so buttery. A definite must to come back!"}
{"text":"Food - If you have never had a pasty before don't get all scared. They are good, I promise. Sometimes they do take a bit to make but it is worth the wait.  Beer- they have a ton of stuff on tap.  Service - Never had a bad experience. They are consistent and not over the top but they earn their tips for sure.  Notes: Dude, the pilgrim? Do it. Its like taking a bite of thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Fantastic to have a few beers and some solid food. Pretty filling, I can never finish the pasties. They always have some of my favorite beers on tap which is definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"I have never been as insulted as I was last  night when my party and I were refused service at Cornish Pasty Company. We sat outside without being approached for 20 minutes, after being told at the door that we could sit anywhere. I finally got up to ask someone for menus, and was told by a male server that he would bring them out. He then proceeded to move in and out, making eye contact with me numerous times, without greeting our table. After 10 more minutes of waiting, a female server asked if we had been helped. We said no, and she said that she would send someone out. 15 minutes later, and we still hadn't been approached. We ended up leaving and eating somewhere else. I can't believe that we were ignored for so long on a busy patio that had at least 3 different servers moving around. We have eaten here numerous times in the past, but will never go back again."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas over 20 years.  That being said, I have always longed for a place to have some pasties.  I make them on occasion, but when you're working an average of 60 hours a week and a family to tend to, it can be quite a pain.  I am the pasty snob...you see...i was raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.    (U.P.)  I am what you call a yooper.   The U.P. is one of the only places in the US you can get a pasty.  It isn't hard to find a pasty shop up there in any city as most have a handful of these shops.  So when my husband discovered there was a pasty place (he's from so cal btw, so I'm the one who turned him into a pasty snob as well...plus he knows to call delicious carbonated beverages pop) in Las Vegas, on my birthday a few years back of all things,  I was super excited for birthday lunch!    I will admit I was a bit nervous and worried I wouldn't enjoy my birthday lunch!  Boy was I wrong!  It was at the old location and although some people might not like the dark, I thought the atmosphere was cool.  The music was great, lots of cool pics of miners, including some in the U.P., and it was neat to watch the guys prepare the food.  Omg the food!  Spot On!  Now, I will say that they do have quite a selection, many trendy pasties, which I'm ashamed to admit, but have tried a few...they have all been pretty good.  However, in these cases we always order a couple of par baked oggies to take home just in case.  So the oggie is the traditional and it is pretty darn delicious!  I'm a little biased, I still think this place I'm probably not supposed to name  in Marquette, Mich is and always will be #1, but cornish pasty company is right there next to it.  In fact, one time my mom was out here to visit I took her there...at first she was hesitant, like why would she want to go to a pasty place when in Vegas when she could get one at home?  She was quite impressed.  She also liked all the trendy choices, and since then, every time (except last time and that was only because I was in the hospital for a major back surgery) she's out here, it is a must.    The new place is nice, parking can be an issue, but well worth it.  Quality of food has not changed.  Hands down awesome.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My husband, myself, and our son usually also share some of the garlic mashed with red wine gravy when we go.  Delicious!  Everything we've tried here has been a hit!  Often times back home I would get a veggie pasty.  So when I feel like a traditional without the meat, I prefer to get the onions and cheese.  I wish they would make one with broccoli, mushrooms, onions, carrots, rutabega, cheddar cheese, cream cheese...hint hint, wink wink.    I also wish there was one closer to the south side of town...southern highlands, the M, St Rose area... the place always seems busy, and there aren't many options in southern highlands so maybe?  But I will still make the drive downtown.    If you haven't tried this place, for the love of God you need to!!!  Thank you Cornish Pasty Co.!"}
{"text":"A gem. Hidden in a strip mall but not to be overlooked! Delicious. Try the Reuben pasty or the Royale with Cheese. Dig the theme."}
{"text":"Amazingly good and flaky bread (any combo) + kilt lifter and I was in heaven! Such friendly staff and very hip, I must add. A must if you are in Tempe! Is this considered tempe? Waitess?! Sorry kilt lifter talking. AWESOMENESS."}
{"text":"I give up. 40 minutes in and we just got our drinks. These poor employees are totally overwhelmed. Do not come here for a business lunch unless you have 2 hours to spare."}
{"text":"This place is balls to the wall, tits out, awesome. If you know what a pasty is and come here for one, I don't need to explain. If you've never had one and are a pasty virgin, please lose it here. The red wine gravy is to die for, the breading is perfect, and the Guinness stew pasty is worth killing for. The staff was polite and checked me numerous times while awaiting my order to ensure that I was taken care of. In short, I fucking love this place. Bee tee dubs, if you pass out at the sight of ink on serving staff, better to just piss off."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate at Squid Ink a few weeks ago, and a few times since.  The sushi is fresh and wonderful. They have a large menu.  The service is spot on.  Their prices are very reasonable.  We highly recommend it.  And plan on going back regularly."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Company is all-around awesome.  I come from an English background and have enjoyed pasties all of my life -- from my grandmother, my mother, and my aunts.  But, hold the phone -- there is an entire RESTAURANT dedicated to these yummies?!  Yes, please!  Many of our family gatherings are Cornish Pasty Company lunches -- we buy a ton of these treasures and eat them together, whether there be 10 of us or 20 of us!  I have dined-in a couple of times and like that experience a lot, too."}
{"text":"The food is the best British food you can get. But it is still British food, so it's not incredible but still pretty good. But the atmosphere is fucking awesome. It is my favorite place to drink in Tempe and the oven chips are an amazing drunk food"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. It can dark for some but it just made the experience better. I had the chicken pot pie pasty and I ended up with leftovers. Great place and will definitely come back here agaib"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you're really missing on something special.  Many friends who have left town make sure to go here on return visits.  For those that don't know, a pasty is essentially a gourmet hot pocket.  They've got everything from standard meat and potatoes to a thanksgiving pasty with all the fixings, and plenty more.  The only pasty I didn't like was one with an ingredient I don't like, so I can't blame them.  I'm not even sure if they have other food, because I always get a pasty or two.  The beer selection is good, and the staff are great and very friendly.  The only downside is that this place is cramped and it can be hard to find a seat at times; there's only one table that can accommodate a crowd (+ the bar).  I hear the new location is better in this regard."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Before going the first time I didn't understand the idea but now I love it. My favorite is probably the traditional but the Royal with Cheese is damn good too! The service is great but it is just a bit small. They are opening a second location soon and I heard it has much more space!"}
{"text":"The lamb vindaloo pasty is spicy and well balanced and arguably my favorite dish ever!"}
{"text":"I've heard a ton of buzz about this place around the main campus but never gave it a try until last weekend. The atmosphere in there is really interesting; walls and windows are painted black, good music with all different types playing.  The staff are very friendly, professional, and fun. I like that instead of wearing uniforms or name tags like most places, they are encouraged to wear normal street clothes which I think gives the place a moreto comfortable relaxed atmosphere.  Great selection of draft beers on hand behind the bar. I gave the meat and cheese a try, and was not disappointed! Really good combination of sausage and cheddar cheese inside a pastry. I will be visiting that place more often now for sure!"}
{"text":"Props to all who were involved with the creation of this location. Food is amazing and the downstairs cocktail lounge is my favorite spot in the house. . We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The pasty's are amazing....especially the Carne Adovada.  The staff is cool....seats are wack! Try the Shirley Temple dessert if you have room!"}
{"text":"Me and a few buddys went here last weekend after Oktoberfest and I gota say it was even better the second time around!! I had the Lamb Vindaloo, which was VERY spicey... which required more beer.  It was the first time my buddies had been here and all of them really enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great beer selection and i love the bangers and mash pastie and the Greek salad!  If you want desert, their homemade banofee pie is amazing!  You will not be disappointed! The only downside is there is usually a wait, so be prepared or go early...and the pasties take awhile to cook, so not a place to go in a rush."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We sat at the counter and it was fascinating to watch the staff navigate the area they have for cooking, serving, prepping and dishwashing.  My vegetarian tikka masala pasty was delicious but too much to eat in one meal, so I have a great lunch for tomorrow.  My husband had the chicken pot pie pasty but wished he'd tried something a little more daring.  This place had a sense of bonhomie that owes more than a little to the tight quarters and the fun, friendly staff.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Let's start with service, the only reason this place gets 2 stars. The service was decent, but by no means great. The cook with the purple bandana was loudly singing for our entire experience. It was like watching tv with a bad jazz station on just as loud in the back round. Please stop him.   The food: I would give this place zero stars based on food alone. It took almost 20 minutes and the pasty tasted like someone tried to smoke me out of my house with a Rosemary bush. And the coleslaw description should read \"cabbage mixed with mayo, shredded and scooped with the cup it's served in\" It was inedible and when we told the bartender she did take actually it off the check which was good. The fries were good, but not good enough to come back for.   On top of everything else, I feel like they keep the lights low for a reason. Everything did have a certain dinge to it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us just sat down on their patio after being told when we walked in to just \"have a seat anywhere.\" After about 20 minutes of not being noticed one of us walked inside and kindly asked for some menus. We were assured there would be a server shortly. 15 minutes later a waitress came out but didn't have menus and said she would send out somebody else. 15 more minutes later still nobody had acknowledged us even though the person we first talked to had looked directly at us multiple times. We literally did nothing rude and feel like we were deliberately ignored or at best just forgotten about. I don't think this place will be receiving any business from us in the future."}
{"text":"How do you describe a pasty to someone who doesn't know what one is??? I like to say it's more like a \"Gourmet Hot Pocket\" but bigger!!! That's the best description I have. I love this place and have yet to visit the new location in Mesa, which is now more convenient for me. This location will always be a classic. The staff is \"ALWAYS\" cool. It's kind of a weird set up. The suite is a very narrow rectangle that spans from end-to-end of the building so the space is limited but they made the best of it. You can tell the crew is a unique one and you can see they all understand each other and their duties as they would have to, being that they are constantly on top and all over each other (NOT LIKE THAT! GET YOUR MIND OUTTA THE GUTTER!). It's actually quite entertaining though! They also have great music playing most of the time and serve beer! You really have to go and check it out for yourself; there's no place like it. My goal is to one day try all the different pasty's.   ***Da Bafroom: Mr. Pasty, may I call you Cornish? You got lucky this time! Of all the times I've been to this Establishment, I've not ONCE EVER been to the restroom. I use to work right down the street so all my restroom needs were always satisfied before hand. Being I'm no longer employed there and my new duty to the Yelp community is \"BAFROOMS\", oh yes my friend, you bet I'll be payin a visit to the porcelain suite of your establishment. I don't anticipate any disappointments by any means but there will be an update on this section soon enough."}
{"text":"Dined at Central Bistro, it was wonderful.  We had the Drunk Bread for an appetizer, it was absolutely delicious.  I had the seared Salmon  with artichokes, haricot vert (string beans), purple potatoes in a lobster sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  Friends had  the peanut thai salad & pasta with clams.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner.  It was a little on the pricey side for me, but well worth the food.  I would eat there again in a hearbeat~"}
{"text":"Given the simple pub interior I was quite surprised at how good the food was.   With the very  reasonable prices if I lived around here permanently I'd be back again and again."}
{"text":"I originally thought this concept was weird. These pasties actually have a really cool history behind it if you ever get a chance to look it up. I tried the wings, which were average, and then the Mexican and Rueben pasties, which were both amazing, I preferred the Reuben. There is a massive selection and all of the options look amazing! I definitely will be back. The parking situation is a little bit tricky as it's on the street, make sure you pay attention to signs. The service is a little bit slow and lax. Overall, good spot."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely outstanding, service is bad. Worth it for that pasty though. My advice? Get it to go and have a picnic in the park just north of the place ;)  Also they're mixed drinks always seem a bit light too... stick with the drafts."}
{"text":"Amazing pasties.  Creative fillings, something for everyone.  Good prices.  Great service.  Friendly atmosphere.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First off, ambiance is dead on! It looks, feels, sounds and heck, smells like a proper pub. Yes they pour an awesome pint. Yes, they offer tastings of their beer so you pick the right one. Yes, service is excellent. Yes, the food is delicious.  Get the chips with garlic and jalapeño, and don't miss the peppered steak. Be warned these pasties are fri kin huge, filling, and you probably won't finish one on its own. The shepherds pie was also delicious, but really it all looks so good. The crust on these pies are flaky, tasty delicious. The fillings are delicious, and they definitely don't skimp on the filling. The sauces that come with the pasty are also delicious too.  Also, they have a royale with cheese. Pulp fiction anyone?"}
{"text":"i love pastys! the selection is awesome. i try a new one every time i visit and they're all so tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere. Good people. And pumpkin pie pasties!!(during the holidays) What more could you ask for! Highly recommended to anyone willing to try something new."}
{"text":"This place is perfect! From the food to the atmosphere, everyone is laid back and the food is just amazing. Not once since I've been dining here have I experienced bad service/food. I definitely recommend the Mexican pasty... let me tell you, you won't regret it. It is SO yummy!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Sunday - tried several different pasties in order of preference  -  Asiago Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Pesto chicken, rosemary steak.  The french fries (chips) were great too."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Bartender asked if I was on lunch break and said he would do what he could to speed me through.  That he did!  Refilled my ice tea, changed order to \"to go\" at last minute!  Great effort and service!  Food was Awesome- cheese and onion.  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"The place was pretty busy for a Saturday dinner, but we didn't have to wait long for a table. Drinks were good and so was the food. Our server recommended I try the Cottage Pie pasty with red wine gravy with and it was excellent and filling. I'll definitely be back to try one of the many other pastys on the menu!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place one afternoon and liked the long bar and narrow seating that has all the ambiance of a New York streetcar diner combined with a mineshaft. I have since been back many times and the food is good and the service is very warm and welcoming. The idea of the Cornish Pasty lends itself to a diverse palate and the desserts, the beer selection, even the coffee here is very good. There are few cafes where you can go by yourself and feel comfortable sitting alone even when you are surrounded by couples on date night and rowdy college students and this is one of those places. There are many pasties to chose from and my favorite is The Cajun with my second choice being A Bit of Salmon. I have yet to try them all but The Mexican is next on the list. My favorite dessert is the Carmel Apple Pasty with Vanilla Ice Cream which is very good. I can be alone with my thoughts here or talk movies with the staff while they prepare, clean, and socialize with each other behind the long narrow bar. It is small and there is often a line but the solo diner can easily find a spot at the bar and I have never had a long wait."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot in Tempe. The food is awesome and the atmosphere is laid-back and fun. Definitely want to go back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Had my rehearsal dinner here and the food was amazing! The guys were very helpful and reserved some tables on the second floor since we had a large party. It was all set up when we got there and the staff was quick in getting order turned around for the group!"}
{"text":"I ate at Cornish Pasty last night and I already want to go back and try some of their other Pasties.  First time going to this place and I really enjoyed the darker, cramped atmosphere.  They had good music playing too.  Waitress was very nice, Started off with some car bombs, $3 anytime, great deal.  Ordered some food and got some beers and about 5 or 10 minutes after than the waitress informed us that she forgot to put in our order.  So she gave us 2 free car bombs.  Nice, the food came out quickly after that so I was pretty happy she forgot about the order.    Food was very good, i liked the spicy asiago chicken, could have been spicier.  My girlfriend said she enjoyed the italian.  Overall, great place for relatively cheap priced food and drinks."}
{"text":"Wow. I tried this place after reading all the reviews on Yelp. If it wasnt for those reviews I would have never ever stumbled upon this place. It's tucked away in an average strip mall and hidden behind an AM/PM. Inside it feels like some Brits renovated an abandoned submarine, it is a tight squeeze in this place but nice a cozy, the lighting is just right and the rustic wood tables and the decor of old mining photos really give this place a distinct mellow feel. The pasty I had the first time was the Bangers and Mash, homemade sausage, some veggies including mash potatoes all inside a delicous pastry or pasty as it is apparently called across the pond. It came with an amazing red wine gravy that just put an already amazing concoction over the top. This place is cheap too! Less than 8 bucks for most the pasties and it is plenty to fill you up. They have alot of British beers on tap too. Overall I would give this place a \"If all British food was like this we would still be under colonial rule!\""}
{"text":"I less than 3 this place. I've been more than a few and always leave smiling, full, and satisfied. The staff is friendly and fairly fast. I am not sure though how exactly one would determine that rock-a-billies as a whole would love this place. Maybe the grease from the stoves and kitchen floor? However, if you like good food and a fair beer selection this is the place for you. And they have good happy hour drink specials if you like to get really drunk. If you don't mind sitting on an unknown someone's lap then lunch rush is probably not a problem for you. Elbow room is the only thing that is lacking here. Of the ones I've tried so far the porky, lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, and lamb & mint are all pretty darn good. This is making me hungry for a pasty!  And the friggin' pb & j pasty is incredible!"}
{"text":"ya know this place is so good, and so unassuming it's a great find.  the food is awesome.  i really enjoy the curry potatoes ....  i've had the mushy peas.  both excellent.  and as far as the pasties i am trying to get thru the entire menu.  and i have not really been disappointed yet.  some i like more than others but that's not changing my review in the slightest.  i've been to both locations and they are very different in scope and appearance but the food is the true star!  the vindaloo is spicy and delicious.  i've had the royale w/ cheese and it's awesome tho it might give you the meat sweats !  chicken pot pie....  bangers and mash...  all really good and such a low key cozy spot.  i'm craving one now..."}
{"text":"2017 Update: Love the new location. Some of the new servers are less than stellar. Taking the whole too cool for school thing a bit far and service suffers. My biggest issue is the music! Too LOUD!! We were there recently for first Friday and none of the people in my party could hear what the other was saying. Ridiculous, we come to CPC to have some great food, good drinks and enjoy each other's company...not have our ear drums blown out by death metal! And maybe mix up the selection a bit?! IDK!   2016: I am officially addicted to the pasties here! Thus far I've tried 16 different \"flavors\" and have enjoyed each of them. But I have to say the Royale with Cheese is my current favorite. Maybe I've watched Pulp Fiction too many times or maybe a bacon cheeseburger and fries rolled into a pasty crust is simply a tasty pasty!  You can dine in or order half baked pasties and take them home to cook up when you're hungry. Mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Wonderful array of pasties, including vegetarian options. I bought a small sampling of different pasties, including traditional sausage rolls, beef and mushroom, and the vegetarian option, spinach and feta. We reheated everything for dinner several hours later, but nothing suffered the delay. The pastry was crisp and not too greasy; pasties were light but packed with well-seasoned filling.   Additionally, there's a well-stocked British goods section--Branston pickle, Heinz beans, Robinson's squash, and just about every kind of candy bar you would want. As I was checking out, I noticed a bowl of Scottish butter tablets, and grabbed a few for ol' memories' sake! I can buy much of this at Wegmans, and even have standing Amazon orders for PG Tips and Heinz beans, but seeing everything together with the pasties was a bit like being in England again!  I had read the rave reviews in WaPo, but never took the time and opportunity to go because it's so out of my way, but for a quick fix for authentic British fare, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic!  Cool atmosphere (Think British Pub with church pews for benches), great, friendly staff and the FREAKING BEST PUB FOOD EVER.  Whatever your taste, they have a pasty or dish to satiate your hunger.  I just really can't say enough good things!  If you come to Vegas, sure hit the Tao, the Bellagio & whatever.  You'll have failed if you don't go here.  It's really that good."}
{"text":"We went to The Cornish Pasty Co. yesterday (Sunday) around 1:00pm and it was packed. Granted, the place is tiny, so it doesn't take many people to fill the restaurant. We waited a few minutes and were able to get two chairs at the bar. If you're sitting at the bar, you're essentially in the open kitchen as well. Like I said, it's very small! We had an awkward few minutes at the bar (sitting in front of people's empty plates), but someone finally gave us menus.   We ordered draft beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown, which happens to be one of our favorites. I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the \"mash\" was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good.   I think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great! I tried the chicken tikka masala and my friend tried the Mexican. I def had the better pasty. And their apple caramel pasty dessert is a must have!  Only tiny complaint was that for such a hot day outside, they could have cranked the AC up a little more for their customers' comfort. It's never a good thing when you have to see yoir customers fanning themselves with their napkins as we're waiting for our food. All in all, a great experience. Great atmosphere and great food with great service!"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as Green Door, Lotus of Siam, and right next to Komol in commercial center plaza. Ample parking galore. Just watch for the slanted parking spaces and which way your car is facing!  I came here with my boyfriend after a show at the Onyx. Love the concept. Punk rock playing over the speakers. Center bar with metal swivel seats and park-benchlike support was a nice touch. Whoever designed this place deserves props!   AMBIANCE:  Make sure to sit at the bar to catch the guys making pasties. (Pronounced \"pass-teas\" and not \"paste-stee\" like the nipple tape in porn I believe lol) it's cool seeing them make a whole batch, but I worry about when they make a whole batch tray of 20ish. What do they do with the rest when they've baked them all and served people? Refrigerate them? It was a pretty dead night for a friday considering that there was First Friday going on.   Love the intimate low-lighting. The design for this bar is cool. Picture polished wood and beer. Clean place. One side of the place has two-seater tables with the same unique park-bench swivel chairs. The other side has two long tables with long benches for bigger parties. I wonder what this place looks like super crowded.  DRINKS:  We ordered the Union Jack IPA and its darker cousin the Wookey Jack IPA. Union Jack is hoppy (IPA, I know) while the Wookey Jack is also hoppy, but more bitter in taste. I like the fact that they carry both. These beers paired well with the pasties we ordered.  APPETIZERS:  To start we got the Hand-Cut fries with the option of garlic and/or jalapenos over it. We greedily got both. This was amazing. Perfect bar food to soak up alcohol. Freshly cracked pepper and sea salt seasoned this dish so well. These fries set them apart from other cardboard-tasting carbon copies.   The leek, potato, and stilton soup ($3.50 cup) was creamy, well-made, and not bland at all. For those who don't know, stilton is a type of rich cheese. I should have asked for the bowl ($5ish). The cheese flavor went beautifully with the leeks and potatoes giving it a hearty flavor. Came a couple slices of bread and butter.  PASTY: My Bangers & Mash pasty was okay. Really drying on the inside including the hard puff pastry encasing it. It came with an excellent red wine gravy sauce so maybe I should have asked for more of that. Although it was okay to eat, it was really salty and dense. I expected maybe a sauce/liquid/melted something on the inside when I stab it with my fork. It would have made the dish more palatable and not just a literal meat-cake.   True, I dipped it in my gravy, but it was still a little difficult to eat. Meat was a bit too tough. Expected it to be a bit more tender.  Maybe I'll try a different pasty next time. The appetizers and ambiance were excellent. I had a bite of my boyfriend's adobada pasty and that was bomb. We're definitely coming back for this one!"}
{"text":"Dont be frightened by the other places in this shopping center.  Once inside there is great authentic food, they even have HP sauce."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in for lunch today. Its a smaller place but very cozy. I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Pasty. It had chicken, red peppers, potatoes and brie. The crust was delicious as well as the filling, but i didn't taste the rosemary as much as I thought I would but the flavor was still good. Also it was just lukewarm and would have been better if it was a little hotter. The service was great and she was knowledgeable about the menu. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Moved! Charleston and Main Street! Opening October 2016! 702-862-4538 The food is amazing so I was devastated when I showed up and it was closed. I will be coming to the new location :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Staff is very friendly and the tunes were awesome. Three level restaurant and every level has its only little vibe. The lounge is my personal favorite, but their street level bar where your able to watch the cooks make the pasties is a close second."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The atmosphere was very chilled out and the service was fantastic. I ate a chicken portobello pasty under the recommendation of the service and it was to die for. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great, real, filling cuisine.  Pasties will be your next comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is great, I really should make an effort to come out more often.  The Reuben is so great!  They have a good selection of beers and good prices.  I am not really sure what else to say here, as the other things I can think of are mentioned in other people's reviews.  I just know that I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"If you want authentic pasties outside of Cornwall this is the place to go. Expect a short wait while you enjoy a drink as they cook to order but you will not be disappointed. Also dog friendly on the patio."}
{"text":"The leek soup is delicious. It's on the salty and flavorful side, and always spot on for me. The bread that comes with the soup is also amazing!  The pasties are hit or miss. I've tried several and have only found a few (Bangers and Mash and Cajun Chicken, maybe some others) that are really good. I mostly come here for the soup.  The ambiance is perfect for a dark english restaurant/pub.  I haven't been impressed by the service, but for the most part it's ok. My worst experience was needing to wait several minutes before a waiter came to me, but once she started it was good. Typically the wait staff seems to be minimally attentive... just enough to take care of you acceptably.  Overall I like it."}
{"text":"Delicious. One Shepherd Pie & one Cajun Chicken  took them home & finished baking them. Sooooo yummy."}
{"text":"Their Royale w/ Cheese IS a tasty pasty!  My colleagues were split on the authenticity of the pasties themselves. Service was slow, iced tea was so-so. Music was louder than expected for lunch time. Good prices. Will probably go back."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is really cute inside and the food is great! I went in with a few friends and sat at the bar. We had great service and the drinks were lovely!  There are a lot of food options if you don't really want to do meat and cheese and even more if you do (you can be \"healthier\" if you want to).  Great place to stop by when downtown!"}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite hang out spots downtown. I haven't had a pasty yet but the atmosphere is exactly what I want, it almost feels like I'm in a medieval pub. 3 levels of seating, pool tables, great drinks, and great music."}
{"text":"Ate at the counter, the guys working were funny and friendly and gave great recommendations. Food was really good. Inexpensive for how much you get... And the red wine gravy...  So good! Had a great meal and the ambiance was great. I love finding places like this."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The beer selection is great. I would highly recommend a half and half with Guinness and Arrogant Bastard."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner with a friend, ordered a salmon pasty.  I would highly recommend.  The Shirley temple dessert was also super fabulous. Two winners. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"OMGGGG!!!! You have to try this place.  The food is excellent!!  I had the Carne Adovada Pasty and I loved it! I was so full so didn't have room for dessert but next time I want to try the  Apple Caramel Pasty.  The service was also excellent and I loved the whole cool vibe of this place.  Can't wait to go back!!  :D :D"}
{"text":"Delicious beer, even delicious-er pasties. If I could live here, I would.   There's maybe nothing I would improve upon except slightly faster service. But even then, I've never gone here while I was in a rush so that's never been a major issue.   The Pilgrim is my favorite, but my friend recently ordered the beef abodobe or something like that and it looked so good I thought about murdering him so I could take it. Ultimately I decided I was too full to eat it, but that guy knows to watch his back now."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. Unique, fun, great music to match the great food. Not the best for kids but it still worked out ok for us."}
{"text":"My cousin and I love meeting for dinner here! The atmosphere is so unique. I don't personally drink but my family loves the beer! I usually order the Italian and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"ok food.  good service.  we ordered a beer that was no longer available, so they recommended an alternative. when the bill came out, we were charged more than advertised on the menu.  waiter explained that their menu prices were not up to date.  made no effort to adjust our final bill to the original menu price. BEWARE - food / drinks may be more expensive than advertised."}
{"text":"I love this place. If your looking for a good English treat, this is the place to go. The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is fun. My favorite pic is \"The Pilgrim\", which has Turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, and comes with a side of cranberry sauce. My husband, who is a vegetarian always gets the vegetarian Shepard's Pie, which he loves.  The only two things that I think could be improved on is the inside of the restaurant is hot hot hot in the summer (better air conditioning). And, there could be more space (it's pretty cramped) for seating. Especially if there is more than 2 people in your party."}
{"text":"We love this place. The pasties are innovative and varied and I am determined to try them all. Current favourites are the Tikka Massala and the Salmon. I make sure I come here at least twice on each trip to Vegas. Don't miss out on the broccoli and cauliflower side or, as we finally discovered this trip, the desserts. The staff are so friendly and helpful whilst being relaxed and it is great to watch the pasties being made. The topping for me is the amazing range of draught and bottled beers. Great value, great food and friendly service - don't be put off by the facade!"}
{"text":"In terms of \"pubs\" in Tempe, the Cornish Pasty is by far and away the best of the best. With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down.   To start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun.   Next, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno.   For the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery).   Finish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP.   5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"We go to Vegas on business a couple times a year, and this is one of our normal eating spots recently.  It really is a gem of a discovery and we look forward to going there at least once each time we are in Vegas.  I've been here 4 times and now I am finally having time to write a review.  The oven chips with garlic are awesome.  Every pasty I have had was delicious.  The workers are very nice, feel free to ask them their favorites since there are so many options.  They play a mix of British punk rock, and some classic rock.  It kind of fits the theme they are going for.  It is a smaller place with some small tables, and also 4 or 5  larger tables (with old church pews for bench seating) which is good for groups and great for the ambiance.  Beware, it is not in the greatest area, and it is a little stinky outside.  But totally worth going... don't let that stop you.  The last time I took some business associates there, they were a little concerned at first, but I told them not to judge a book by its cover or this restaurant by its location.  They loved it!  Be sure to read the history of the Cornish Pasty, it is really cool."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed other Yelpers didn't point out the time it would take for the pastry to bake... I dined alone and given the advice about it been filling, I didn't order an appetizer. The about 20 min wait felt like forever. Of course one could start drafting the reviews or distract oneself with these devices we couldn't get our hands off....   I had the lamb vindaloo and I finished the whole thing!! It's 90 degrees out and freezing in here... the vindaloo was so hot (spicy) it totally warmed me up. The mint yogurt balances the heat very well I just wish there is more... the pastry was over cooked and hard (maybe that's why I waited so long?) I would've liked it flaky. Overall a great value meal and good eats.  This place has a real English pub feel which is cool.  Very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awful service and the food is okay, but prepared by people running their hands through their hair, scratching their beards then handling the food.    Everyone working here had the too cool for school attitude.  Nobody approached us to let us know you seat yourself.  This place tries to be more of a scene than a great food spot.  It fails to execute in both areas.    I heard the Tempe spot was great, so when they opened a downtown Phoenix location I thought I'd give it a try.   I recommend you pass."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great beer selection and craft cocktails. The prices are totally reasonable . Chance and Andy we're providing great service!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Asiago. Liked the food and ambience was nice. The oly flaw is that there are more potatoes in chicken tikka masala than chicken itself."}
{"text":"We saw this place on a local cable show called 'Check please' and it looked good well it was not good it was great! We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and the guys doing the cooking were very cool as a matter of fact everybody working there was very cool and willing to go the extra step for example are waiter was telling us about the beer they had on tap and we were trying to decide so he brought us a couple of samples without us asking-nice. As I said the guys doing the cooking and prep were more than willing to talk to us telling us about the different dishes even though they were very busy.   I ordered the 'bangers and mash' while my wife had the salmon both were very very good and for dessert we had the chocolate baked bread {that might not be the exact name but its close} good god it was soo damn good! Next time I'm getting one to take home.  We're going back with our neighbours this week and I can't wait!  If I could give 6 stars I would! Really great food and excellent people!  PS we went to the one on Alma School in Mesa."}
{"text":"food: good, service: average. been here several times before and would give it 4 stars. however, last visit with crazy with five (5!) items they were out of. still retain 4-star rating despite that since they have always been consistent in the past."}
{"text":"I've heard this is where it's hoppin' in Tempe and that you can get some good Sheperd's Pie here. The hubs and I went around nine on a weekend night and it was still busy and loud! My husband very much enjoyed his pasty as he loves cheese and bready foods, but I could've used some more freshness. The mustard sauce I ordered with my pasty was creamy but not right with my pasty so I switched with my husbands sweeter marinara to accompany my eggplant pasty. We sat outside and even though it was May they had the heaters on because it was chilly. Very considerate for us true Arizonans. I would like to go back to try their garlic mashed potatoes and Sheperd's Pie sometime in the future!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. Hipster Hot Pockets. Twice we've gone, and both times I've had the Peppercorn Steak, and the BF has had the Royale with Cheese. Both times, they were great.  Crispy on the outside, piping hot on the inside and they come with yummy dipping sauces. Great beer selection as well, too bad there isn't a location conveniently located near me! Locale is Ok-ish, typical college-area pub/eatery-like atmosphere. A bit dark, the only complaint is the church pews for seating of large groups. Not gonna lie, they straight up feel like they're about to collapse, and they make it damned near impossible to get out of if you're not sitting on the end. Hope you don't have to get up to pee! Eek. But hey, it's about the food, right?"}
{"text":"What a great surprise.  The pastry is excellent and it wraps around just about any kind of flavors that you like.  I enjoyed Marcella my wife enjoyed turkey dinner and my mother joined us and ate every bit of her Greek way. Very good value"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The Royale and a giant Rogue Hazelnut Brown Ale is my go-to order. If you catch them on the right night, Darius may even serenade you with Disney songs!"}
{"text":"Friday night @ 8 pm is a nutty time to go. There was a 10-15 min wait, and there was an eccentric mix of patrons there - babies, college students, and retired folks. And, oh yeah, us, the regular \"normal\" folks.  We got seated at a long bench, and the first thing we were told is that they were out of multiple items. Argh! that's always disappointing.  Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.  Did I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)?   Before the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap! Seriously, their party should have gotten a whole communal table to themselves because it was absurd.  Food came - it was hot, and everyone seemed happy. I had the toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. Really enjoyable, but it's hard to eat when your arms are squished by your side due to overflowing human flesh that's not yours, or your friend's. Sometimes I don't want to make new friends!  Noise level: loud. Hipsters: present."}
{"text":"I just had my first Cornish Pasty experience, and can I just say yummmm!  I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend is a carnivore.  I was pleasantly surprised that I had an entire page of unique and delicious options to choose from, and I know I will be returning soon to try more.  On another note, for any of you other vegetarians out there, I sat at the bar and could see the prep area where they cut the scrumptious pasties and prep them up to go out to customers, and to my satisfaction and delight, they were thoughtful enough to use a separate knife to cut my veggie pasty.  All in all, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"The pasties are yummy and the variety is almost overwhelming. I ordered the chicken tikka and boy oh boy was it such an incredibly tasty pasty! The service was not overly quick but well paced because they bake the pasty fresh.  I am interested in the dessert options"}
{"text":"Someone just asked me what my favorite place to eat in Vegas is, and yep, Cornish Pasty Co. is the first place that popped into my head.  Who doesn't love some good old fashioned comfort food?? The BF and I have tried quite a few of the pasties now, and have loved them all.  My personal favorite has to be the bangers and mash though.  And we love the oven fries, OMG, they are so delicious!! And the deserts?? they are crazy good.  Everything is so fresh, and the service is always excellent.  And did I mention the prices?? So reasonable for Vegas.  Whenever we have out of town visitors, this is one of the first places we take them for lunch or dinner.  Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in Arizona, let alone Tempe.  And that's from day one... (I was pretty late to the Cornish Party).  The atmosphere is unbeatable... feels like I'm in San Fran or London.  The steak / blue cheese pasty is fannnnnnnntastic."}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed up the wazoo - and for once, I agree with the near-unanimous 5 star ratings of this place, though I do have some recommendations:  (1) For your first time there, go for the traditional \"Oggie\" pasty - it is hands-down their best (2) DO NOT order the Duchess beer unless you already know you like it - I love sour Belgian beers, but this just tasted like malt vinegar to me (3) The shepherd's pie pasty to me is just OK - unless you're a huge shepherd's pie fan, skip it  Also, for atmosphere - if you're expecting a quaint pastry shop, you'll be hugely disappointed. This is a dimly lit hipster bar that plays loud(ish) music. I personally like those things, but I did see a few retirees come in that looked very sad indeed upon realizing this wasn't a cute little bakery."}
{"text":"The food looked terrific but after a 44 minute wait for food I canceled my order. Female bartender also too good to talk to me. I'm generally a generous tipper but if you treat me poor then I get upset."}
{"text":"Really good selection of pasties, puff pastry really good, however a little frugal with the fillings.  Unique eats."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to leave two different sets of stars. My 2/5 will hopefully get their attention. I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon.   The food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet.   The atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE.   The one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.  If you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch."}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the mesa location over a dozen times. The first time I had \"a lovely bit of salmon\"...it was amazing. The second time I had the pepper steak, which was also amazing...but let's face it beef is easy. So every other time I've been I have \"a lovely bit of salmon\" because there's just no place on earth that does salmon better.  I went so far as to bring adults (people over 45) with me one time. They loved it too; even though I have to admit it's a bit noisy and young-ish in the atmosphere....but not too young. ~I know all the songs playing, but many of them are older than I am."}
{"text":"This is a cool place. I would love it if I lived near by it would be my favorite place to belly up. Oh to dream as I live in suburbia, sigh. We walked in one of the many doors and find ourselves in a dark skinny bar with many open two tops and a full four top. Yes, we are with our boys so we need four top. The (I believe) manager said sit where ever you would like. I asked are there more tables? He motions around the bend of the bar. We walk around and into a restaurant with HUGE tables with church pews for seats. Obviously not from a Catholic church as they were comfortable.   We grabbed a table and spread out. The waiter was great, showed up right away with menus, made beer suggestions and brought them quickly. We perused to the menus, a lot to choose from! I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, husband ordered the vegan pasty selection, kid 1 ordered Chicken Alfredo (it had bacon) pasty and kid 2 ordered Potato Leek soup with fresh bread. My husband and kid 1 devoured every bit and loved it. I could only eat half and enjoyed it. Kid 2 loved the bread and ate some of the soup, it was delish but not for him (blue cheese).   I think I need to go back and get something different. It was good but I just think it had potential to be great. I might try something more traditional or go for the carne adovada pasty.  Overall it was a great experience. The decor and atmosphere was great (great hangover bar as very dark), service was perfect and food very, very good."}
{"text":"Great place. Fast service and interesting atmosphere. Wonderful food- the pesto chicken was amazing. Not as hard to find as I thought it'd be. You've gotta go."}
{"text":"Yum! Freshly baked meat pies that are delicious! Salad was also good with really good house made dressing. Hope to be back!"}
{"text":"Shepherd's Pie was amazing! This visit certainly changed my perception of British food. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely return."}
{"text":"3.5 stars I love the food here, and being British I know a genuine pasty when I see one. These are the genuine article. And the place isn't pretentious at all, which is cool.  However, if you're sensitive to salt for your blood pressure like I am then you might want to think twice before ordering.  I'm not sure if it's in the fillings, the gravy, or the pastry itself but the salt content in a pasty from here can be really high.  That doesn't stop me from coming back, but still..."}
{"text":"Good pasty's n good beer. Ask for the Iron maiden trooper Ale. The ambience is nice too."}
{"text":"Tired of the same ol' bar food on different plates? Then you have to try Cornish Pasty!  Pronounced pas ty from the word pasta.  Started with the oven baked fries, which are the very best fries we ever had.  14 and 20 oz hard ciders.  Then we had the steak-leek-portabella-zucchini-stinson cheese pasty and were amazed.  Had the sausage and cheddar with red wine sauce pasty also.  Can't decide which was our favorite as each was deliciously satisfying and unique. Had the sticky toffee pudding which was equally fantastic. Best part?  Everything!  Also only $40 for all of this!"}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy heaven wrapped in a bread and then dipped in red wine gravy.. go ahead and order the bangers and mash! i try to order something different every time i go.. and so far its been a good choice on my part. its definitely a plus that strong bow is on tap."}
{"text":"Went to this place on opening night with hubby and a couple friends. The staff were all friendly, and the service was good. We had to wait for a table, so we hung out at the bar while we waited. They have a nice variety of beers on tap and in bottles. The food was excellent. Living in Sunrise Manor, there aren't many nearby good vegetarian-friendly restaurants, so we were happy to see that there are a lot of vegetarian items on the menu.   The restaurant itself looks nice on the inside. Casual atmosphere, with old pictures on the wall that reflect the history behind the place. There was a good variety of music being played, and none of it sucked. There are lots of two-seater tables and plenty of room at the bar, but there aren't many tables for larger groups. The seating at the larger tables is made out of old church pews, which was an interesting touch.  Overall, we had a great time and really enjoyed the food and drinks. We will definitely become regulars here."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch, once on my own and once with a co-worker and I enjoyed the food experiences both times but the atmosphere...well...it could use some help.  Visit #1: I bellied up to the counter so I could eat while watching the kitchen staff put together some of the dessert pasties. I ended up also sitting next to the manager or owner who was cracking away on his laptop. I didn't mind though, the building was small and he might not have an office to work in. My main issue with the ambiance is just how dark it is in there, it is almost like a seedy bar with really low hanging lights over the tables that emit very little light.  On this run, I tried the Rosemary Chicken pasty and it was awesome. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the peppers tasted great and the potatoes were spot on. It was like eating a handheld rosemary chicken pot pie, but better. i wasn't a big fan of the mustard sauce, but the pasty was perfectly good on its own.  Visit #2: My coworker and I sat at a table that eventually got half-occupied by another large work group. It was a little distracting and the table situation should really be worked on, but I didn't see it as a big problem nor did my coworker.  This time around I tried the Oggie, a traditional pasty with steak, potatoes, onions, and swede with the red wine gravy. I've had some pasties in my time, but this was spot on and very tasty.  I will definitely be visiting again, though I will probably stick to eating at the bar..."}
{"text":"So I love this place, been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about it. Great food, great beers amazing, personal service and I never wanted to go anywhere else for my afternoon beers and food. Recently, however, they have formed a new policy where there is no smoking on the patio area, fully outside, ventialted patio. I do not smoke, never have never will, but that idea is ridiculous. If you want to go to a non smoking family style restaurant, and there is an applebees in every town in america period. If you want a fun, hip atmosphere with the product and staff to back it up, you come to the Cornish pasty and if smoke bothers you, you stay indoors and thats that. Dear pasty: dont give in to these high horse, internet terrorists. Your fan base loves you and will stay true. Go corporate like.everyone else, fine, someone else will be more than willing to stay local and real."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable and they have a great selection of beer. The downside is the employees are all strung out hipsters."}
{"text":"I love the Pasties they have here. I have not dined in yet but I have ordered to go a few times and I haven't had a complaint yet. My favorite is the royal with cheese but the oggie, and the pilgrim are my other go to!"}
{"text":"I'm torn here. Best food ever. Unfortunately their service more or less sucks. They staff the place with 20something hipsters who are all stoned (especially in the kitchen) and think they are too cool for school. Don't let hipsters run a joint. They are only good for smoking them."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. I got the bangers and mash as my mother recommended them, and the scotch eggs as an appetizer. The appetizers are small and cheap, and the meals are large and delicious. The reason they lose a star is more personal for me, the lighting is too dim, and when someone opens the door, the sunlight is blinding. And they do not have kiltlifter on tap. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite restaurants.  Local restaurant  with delicious food.  For those who don't know, a pasty is basically a gourmet Hot Pocket.  The vegetarian friendly menu consists of a lot of pasties and a few salads, all under $10 and very filling.  They even have dessert pasties.  I've been here many times, and the only dud I've ever had was a very dry Chicken Alfredo.  The Cajun Chicken has trumped the Balsamic Portabello as my favorite.  My main gripe with this place is that it is very small.  There are only 2 or 3 tables that seat more than 2, not counting the bar counter.  There is usually a wait for dinners on Friday and Saturday.  I'm just glad I live close enough to do take out on those nights since they don't deliver.  My friends love the 32oz Guiness served in mini-pitchers for less than $9."}
{"text":"Never been to a place like this. Have to admit was a little scared to come in. I had come with my aunt while visiting my son in Scottsdale. The old saying never judge a book by its cover. We're just older and and live in small towns. But one thing I love about yelp is the different places you find. And this is one. We were so glad we stop in. I got the salmon and my aunt got the burger one. They had the best flavor and such a unique crust. We will definitely be back on this visit."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for several years.  My grandmother made pastys until the day she died at age 94 in 2001. These are ALMOST as good as hers and easily the best I have eaten away from home. The owner is a for real cornish man. Never had a bad meal. Never brought someone here to eat who did not rave about it. Lots of variety, but I always come back to the traditional Oggie.  Don't forget to read the history of the pasty. My great and great great grandfathers were hard rock miners and the work they did was hard and dangerous. They deserved good food and they got it. Now you can too - without having to enter a mine!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time to go here. Food and drinks are always good. Sometimes you have to wait a bit but I expect that. What I don't expect is when some entitled people come in just like other places downtown and throw a fit when things are set in front of them right away.  Last night had to listen to this obnoxious man(being nice about it) complain he had to wait for his food. It takes time to cook something unless it's pre-made! What this place does need is a bouncer at the door to kick people like that out so the staff doesn't get frazzled and everyone else can enjoy."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this.  They make the pasties from scratch here and it shows.  These are light years ahead of pasties I've had in Butte, MT (a mining town).  They are billions and billions of light years ahead of the nasty, ass-flavored pasties I've consumed at various \"British pubs\" throughout the Midwest.  These pasties are almost certainly better than anything you can get in the UP of Michigan, though I've thankfully never been to Yooperland.  Great beer selection and superior service.  I know, I know, it's in the sketchy Commercial Center.  If you're ascared, just go there during the day...it will be OK!!!  I can't envision coming to Vegas again w/o making a trip here.  It's just that good."}
{"text":"Having lived in Tempe, AZ where Pasty originated, I was so thrilled they brought one to Vegas. It has all the components of what made the original location great - awesome beer selection, delicious food, and awesome staff. I highly recommend checking this place out if you are just looking for a relaxed place to enjoy a good drink and tasty snacks."}
{"text":"I adore their food and enjoy their beer selection. Parking is hard to come by, but totally worth it.  Would by stock in the company if I could!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best spot in Tempe. A+ for atmosphere, drinks, beer, food, and service!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the menu really isn't designed at all for the downtown lunch crowd. A half (or mini) pasty and soup or salad feature would really help. So would seating designed more for small lunch groups. As is both the food and restaurant are basically designed to cater to drunk college kids on a night out.   Still good, but limits the spot as a lunchtime meetup"}
{"text":"I've you've never tried a pastie you must come here!! The food is excellent and the service is pretty rocking. I love the staff super friendly and helpful. Everything is made from scratch and the ingredients are quality. It's awesome watching them make pasties in front of your face while you wait for your food. I will definitely tell all my friend so I can come back all the time. The happy hour is 3-6. A dollar off draft beers and wines. They have 14, 20, and 34Oz. So I'm sure they have the size for you. I hope you come and check it out."}
{"text":"SO MUCH YUM! I almost wish this place wasn't so close to my work and so good because now I'm tempted to go there often! Girls working were super friendly and again... the food was AMAZING. Hope to see more locations open up in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is friggin' awesome. Been several times and always had a great experience. Menu is huge but not overwhelming. Food is reliably good. Great beer selection, prompt service and a really awesome interior. Don't let the location turn you away."}
{"text":"Great food and service! It's very low key and that's what I like about it. It's not your usual snobby Vegas restaurant. It makes you feel like you're not in Vegas. Every pasty I've had here has been amazing. The garlic jalapeño chips are great as well as the scotch egg! The beer selection is perfect. A good blend of beers from easy drinking to big and bold."}
{"text":"What a different experience. I liked it! The pasties were good. I'm a sucker for any kind of stuffed pastries. I got the cheese steak. It was like a philly steak sandwich expect for the pastry instead of bread. I preferred Cornish Pasty's because I prefer the pastry over bread. I also tried their mushroom soup, which was rich with good flavors and walnuts. I got the curry potatoes and they were just OK. I was expecting cold potatoes like potato salad, but these were cubed and either fried or baked. I look forward to trying their other pasties soon."}
{"text":"I've worked my way through about half of the menu so far.  The food is nothing less than fantastic and I've yet to find anything that is not phenomenal.  This is one of the places I take my friends from out of town.  The place looks like a bar than also serves food.  Don't let that fool you.  This is one of the best restaurants you will find in the Vegas Valley in this price range.  You owe it to yourself to try the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno.  All of the Pasties I've tried are delicious. The service is great.  One of the things I really enjoy is how much the staff appears to love being there.    The location is a little tricky to find and is in a large, older shopping center with a lot of character, most of it quirky.  I've never had problems there, but I keep my eyes open and pay attention to the surroundings...  Still, I've never felt unsafe there.  It's well worthwhile to go out of your way to get in there and enjoy.    The restaurant doesn't appear to advertise, but I really don't think they need to given the quality of the food.  This is easily among my top three favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service.  Inexpensive delight! Had the chicken greek pastie.  Full of flavor"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their food is always amazing, and this location is always packed. I don't wonder why because it is such a great place to eat. I always get the Royale and it is always delicious. Definitely would go back if it was closer. Any time I'm in Tempe I will be grabbing a cornish pasty"}
{"text":"Having been to this area before for a different restaurant, I was surprised to see that Cornish Pasty Co. was in a place I was familiar with. With an unsuspecting exterior, this place had a modern homey feel to it when I walked in. The only thing I have to complain about is the schoolroom carpet: one color, thin and boring. The old church pews that served as booths were a plus -- I definitely thought they were charming. Lastly, make sure your butt pockets don't have buttons. The bar stools will eat them.  I have never been to a pub. I didn't know what to expect when it came to the food, let alone was pasties were like. The wait for your food is worth it. I ordered the Bangers and Mash (pork sausage with sage, cut into cubes topped with rich mashed potatoes); my mom had their garden salad. I'm assuming her dressing was excellent because no sooner so I see her dip a cucumber into it, she's pouring the whole thing all gun ho'.  Cornish Pasty Co. offers a wide variety of options; even a whole section dedicated to those that are partial to vegetarianism. I didn't see their dessert options, but am aware that they offer them, as a couple behind me were enjoying something sweet. Also, their alcohol selection was highly varied from your typical bar fare to more ethnic choices.  I will be sure to stop by this location when the sun sets for dinner because as it stands, it's too hot to enjoy a lunch there."}
{"text":"This is a foodie's required stop. A menu that is genuinely thoughtful. Outstanding food and great imported draught beer selection. Must stop when stuck in an airport hotel for  mealtime."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Casual English pub, every booze imaginable, but the real attraction for me is the phenomenal, affordable food and fantastic service with very competent staff.  The soups are great, the salads are great, the pasties are great and the homemade bread is to die for!  The menu offers something for everyone: meat lovers, vegetarians and even gluten free by request (takes a bit longer for that last one.  I haven't tried the gf myself, but a colleague raves about the gf pasties).  You can also get the food as take-out or half baked (par baked) to take home and finish in your own oven.  Cornish Pasty rocks.  Go there!"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone - from mexican, to traditional english, greek and indian. The food is more than filling, the price is very reasonable for what you get, and the staff is friendlier than most places I've been. They serve good beer, and serve $3 car bombs all the time - if you don't like the food, it's easy to drink until you do. It's not very spacious, but that adds to the charm - you may spend up to 15 minutes waiting for a 2-top, but I've never really minded the wait. The soundtrack is better than any you're going to find - I recently ate my Bangers and Mash while listening to Clarence Carter - Strokin'. This quickly devolved into a singalong for several of us, something I would be surprised to find out happens quite often here. I've heard some people say that their pasties aren's as good as other places, but I doubt that these others have the variety and consistent quality that the Cornish has. The salads served here are of exceptional quality as well.  The only problem I've come across here is that the pasties are pre-made, meaning that special requests (no mushrooms, extra meat, etc) cannot be honored. Usually this does not present a problem, but it is something to be aware of."}
{"text":"My sister and I ended up going back to Cornish Pasty almost exactly a year later.  It was crowded but slightly less so than our first experience.  The server that we got this time actually served us.  We were so happy to receive food and beverage in a reasonable amount of time that we cried tears of joy.  The server also apologized for the slow service and said that First Night nights were always a little crazy.  We didn't feel there was a service problem.  The beer selection is excellent and the pasties are AMAZING!  I would go back but not if I had to wait 30+ minutes for service like we did the first time around."}
{"text":"Dude, this place was too good. We had the Scottish egg, cheesy broccoli and cauliflower bake (seriously turned me into a cheese lover, I was scraping the cheese off to eat), garlic and jalapeno oven baked potatoes (super flavorful), cottage pie pasty and the royale (the outside pastries were so buttery, flavorful, with an excellent texture). The meal was extremely bittersweet because everything was so delicious but I knew I wouldn't have it again for a long time because I don't live in Vegas, and now I am sad."}
{"text":"This place was interesting. I had never heard of a patsy before, I was told they are meat pies served with gravy or a sause on the side. We went for their vegan pasty that we had read about on the happy cow app. When we arrived ( after a short trouble finding the place in a huge shopping strip) we were told they were out of the vegan pasty, but I decided due to being starving I'd try one. I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty. It was sooooo good . I would come back every time I'm in Vegas but only if they also had the vegan ones available for my boyfriend ( who had to sit and watch me eat)as well. The service was great and prompt."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and it's been pretty busy. Feel free to sit at the bar; they'll still feed you there. The first time I order the Oggie and it was quite good. This past time I went for the Mexican and it was stellar. Just the right amount of spice and it served w/ salsa and sour cream as well. Be sure to order chips with your beverage or when you order your entree because they do take some time in the oven. Finally, if you're a beer drinker, I think you'll be quite pleased with the variety of beers on tap."}
{"text":"My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and were absolutely satisfied. It has a great eclectic environment and the food was great! Oh and did I mention the 13% Molotov Beer !!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the food is so delicious and incredibly satisfying. Best part is that ALL the Pastys are under $10. How awesome right?! I've been back three times and everything has been consistently glorious. Thank you Cornish Pasty Co. for existing.  -Marissa"}
{"text":"100% the best place to take people from out of town for a Phoenix experience. Everything from the food to the music is unique to Cornish Pasty. Little known fact - the coffee is fantastic. They serve it with whipping cream so it's super delish. LOVE SO MUCH."}
{"text":"This establishment was amazing the ambiance was fantastic for a dinner setting, music playing was great, and the staff was friendly and informative. This was my first time eating here. My friend told me how good the food was here.  I being a foodie deiced to come and check it out. I ordered a beer, chips, shepherds pie, the greek and the apple desert. Everything I ate was amazing. It was well priced. I thought it was going to be more expensive but I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came out. Everything was $35 and I still have plenty of leftovers for another meal. The manager on site walked around to every table asking was everything ok? Did you enjoy the food? I find it to be a great quality when the management and staff truly care about you experience. Such great customer service here, I highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't done so already. I am positive you will have the same experience as I did, if not better."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in our neighborhood. The music is awesome the food is reliably tasty and wait staff is really nice. We really enjoy going to our local Cornish pasty, near Dobson ranch!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on other Yelp reviews.   OMG I'm glad I did!  Food is Excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  The place is definitely hipster-ish, but that did not bother me at all.  I had the Royal with cheese pasty, oven fries with garlic and jalapeno, and a Scotch egg.  Everything was delicious and I couldn't finish it all.  Mmmmm leftovers!!!  Go check it out."}
{"text":"this place is dope... hands down money well spent... on a date or just with friends... its the place to be for a good time..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The atmosphere is great, you have free pool in the back , great ale and it's bigger then what you see when you walk in. The food is to die for it's fresh made when you get there. There is many pasty's to choose from, I got the roast beaf and it was delicious with a homemade horseradish dipping sauce. The pasty dough is crispy and cooked to perfection. I got the soup of the spicy rice bean it was delicious ! But I will being defiantly going back to try other pasty's , I suggest this place to anyone who wants to try some true British food starting in the 1200's for the miners . It's a great place with great food enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place is realllly yummy.  If you like/are Rockabilly you will love this place.  If you have an affinity for girls/guys with tattoos/gauges you will enjoy this place  If you want thanksgiving dinner shoved into an unhealthy English version of a Pita Pocket you will DiiiiiiiiiEEEEEEEEEEE (Rachel Zoe ) this place.  I'm naut ruckabillie but I \"dig\" this place. It's really dark inside, and the food goes good with beer which they have much of.  There are really great/grotesquely intriguing pictures of coal miners on the walls too which are fun to look at while eating said pastys...not the nipple coverings.  TRY: the pasta salad..it ain't a pasty but holy-rockabilly-hell it is effin' good!"}
{"text":"Cornwall native Dean Thomas had a major hit when he deciced to open The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe, AZ. A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say \"Pass-Tee\"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.  Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering. From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.  We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!  If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guiness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.  The current location is quite small however and it's proximity to ASU guarantees a packed house on Friday and Saturday nights. Happily, Dean is opening a second location in Mesa on Doson Rd. and Guadalupe Rd. that will not only be larger but has a more open environment as well. Opening has been announced for Saturday, January 17th 2009 and you can bet we'll be there.  Take the time to find The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I think I just found a new favorite hang. The food is exellent and the ambiance is incredible. The music is classic (like Dylan or Neil Young) so you won't find any rap gang bangers here. Inside is very dark which I like, but if it is a nice day, they have a nice roomy patio on the North side where you can relax. Very casual yet classy. It is difficult to describe. If this is what English pubs are like then Americans could learn a thing or 2 from them."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot. When reviewing I review 3 things. Quality of food, service, and ambience.   Quality of the food was delicious. They have a ton of selections even for vegetarians which my wife and I loved. We had the eggplant parm patsy and the Greek patsy. Wow. Unreal. I'm sure anything you choose will be incredible.   Service was great! Our servers name was Kacey. She was real sweet and asked if we needed anything multiple times. Good came out reasonably quick. Everyone was pretty friendly.   Ambience was ok. We walked in and there really wasn't clear process on how to sit or where. After we found a table though (it's self seating) everything was great!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, i had the chicken tikka masala pasty and it was incredible. We also ordered regular fries and fries with garlic and they were both great. For dessert we had the Shirley Temple's pudding and it was also fantastic."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to visit this little gem. Great beer, great service, great food. I had never had this kind of food before but I am now a huge fan. They make the bread your dinner goes into right in front of you. I had the Mashers and Bangers. Sausages and mashed potatoes baked inside this delicious bread of some sort. It was phenomenal. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"If you like Cornish Pasties, then you'll dig this place. Their traditional 'flavors' are spot on with what you'd get across the pond in the UK.  They also have a LOT of non-traditional versions - like a chicken tikka.  And if you have no clue what a pasty is, but you like things like pot pies or even hot pockets, then give this place a go.  Good selection of beers, too.  Only thing to be aware of is that the place sort of looks closed (or even out of business) from the side entrance. Don't let that fool or deter you."}
{"text":"British fare. Fresh pasties and a variety of them. A lot of beers on tap. Located in Commercial Center. I think they'd be better served to be in a location either on or near the STRIP, or in the southwest part of town."}
{"text":"Amazing.   Yummy...peppered steak.   Best Meal In Vegas. ..Will return.Vegas Best Kept Secret. .Ops Now Its Out..."}
{"text":"It never fails: I'm never disappointed. You can't go wrong here. Great atmosphere, good people, awesome food! If you've never had a pasty then I feel for you!  I absolutely love the Lovely Bit a Salmon, but other great ones are the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Rosemary Chicken, Pilgrim and the awesome Chicken Greek. Many of their pasties are available vegetarian style too."}
{"text":"The location is tucked away in and commercial park. The outside is very unassuming and can easily be mistaken for a random old hole in the wall bar. They have an open kitchen which can make the place warm but smell really good. I can't tell if it's suppose to be a bar with food or a restaurant with a bar. The place is small with a bar in the middle. The table next to me had kids so I assume they are families are welcomed.   The pastries stuffed with goodness are amazing. I had the Greek one it was really tasty. Definitely a heavy meal so dieters beware. But worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Why oh why have I waited so long to try this place? The soups are beautiful and my rueben pasty was only phenomenal. Note to self and others, go super bowl Sunday...it is empty and no TV 's!!!"}
{"text":"It isn't often I'm so compelled to write a review but after having read everything else it goes without saying. This is by far the most authentic pasty shop in all of the US if not the world. The wisdom they displayed in serving their pasty in the Cornish manner is astounding to me. Upon the first bite I was rushed back to my childhood and reminded as a food historian this is truly what's worth preserving. Not many people are daring enough to put the crease of a pasty on the top. The margarine and salt used was spot on in 1905 when the pasty became an International symbol of Cornish. The price was slightly higher then I would have imagined however, prices at this fine establishment are actually done in pounds sterling keeping with the authentic experience of eating a pasty. Well worth it! Simply delightful."}
{"text":"I got a lamb and mint pasty, which was really good. I like the red wine gravy, or whatever they call the sauce with it. There are tons of options, so it was hard to pick one. Also, they appear to have a counter-serve location off Mill near the ASU campus, which is probably a more convenient location for out-of-towners in Tempe. This one is a little bit out there."}
{"text":"Wasnt sure what to expect. Never had a cornish pasty before. Went for a bday happy hour and had the greatest time. Waitress answered all of my crazy questions and was very patient. Low lighting and catchy music made for a great experience. The pasty i ordered was so delightful. Great flavors just enough spice wrapped in a flaky crust. I even ordered one to go for family at home so they could try. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We eat here frequently and have loved everything we try. My favorite is anything with their red sauce. Love the new environment even more than the original. We have a young child and they are always willing to accommodate for him as well."}
{"text":"13 minutes, start to finish, during the lunch rush, no less!  I visited for the first time a few days ago, and let's just say it's not a good thing for my BMI that my office is less than a mile from here.  Plenty of vegetarian and vegan (!) options.  As a insanely and annoying picky quasi-vegetarian, I'd like to see more vegetarian options withOUT faux meats.  But, perhaps as I make my way down to that section of the veg options, I'll change my mind.  The place seems a bit more cozy (aka cramped) than I usually care for, but I'll be back for take-out and eat-in for the food and service alone.  Tip: there are two entrances. I came in the west side door and couldn't really figure out where I was supposed to order.  Make your way to near the end of the bar and you'll be at the register for take-out."}
{"text":"British food is normally bad, but I decided to give this a try. It was better than I expected! I had the lamb mint, and was quite surprised at the flavor! The pastry was ver light, and the goodies stuffed inside were very good. Not a bad price, and worth the trip."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service on a Saturday afternoon. There was 10 people here yet it took them 40 minutes to prepare one chicken tikka masala pasty. The curry was hot but the potatoes and chicken were cold. I'm not sure how they managed this. If you have a craving for pasties, go to the Mesa location and save yourself some grief."}
{"text":"Delish. I had the Italian. Yummy, can't wait to get hungry again so I can eat the rest of it."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. The food is fantastic (I recommend the Cajun Chicken pasty), the servers are really hip and awesome, the kitchen is open for you to see how your food is being made, and the prices are fair. Don't be discouraged if you realize they make the pasties the night before, because they cook them the day of and give you the option to take them home half cooked if you want to eat them at home and cook them yourself. Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list."}
{"text":"We were finishing up our Arizona trip and staying near the Phoenix airport for our last night. We found the Cornish Pasty Company on Yelp and glad to see they were nearby (and had all day Happy Hour on Sundays!)  The interior was surprising dark, but the outdoor patio was inviting - especially as we were heading back to the chilly midwest the next day. We grabbed a table on the patio and were greeted by our server shortly after.  We opted for a couple of beers as we reviewed the menu - lots of great options and hard to make a decision.  I went with the Greek Chicken Pasty and my husband decided on the Guiness Stew Pasty and a side of baked chips to share. The food was great, but unfortunately, the entire experience was overshadowed by the fact that staff refuses to enforce the \"No Smoking on the Patio\" rule. There was a patron at the table next to us smoking despite sitting right in front of a sign - staff obviously didn't care as nothing was said. I finally let one of the servers passing by know that someone was smoking and the response was pretty nonchalant; however, they did ask that person to step outside the patio. The group sharing our table was very appreciate especially considering there were several small children nearby.  Not even five minutes later, someone else was openly smoking right next to the patio door leading to the interior - multiple servers walked by and did nothing.  This probably would have been a four-star experience without the smoking!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are very picky about where we eat. We always read a good review and end up disappointed BUT THIS PLACE DESERVES THE STARS!  1) The place is beautiful! The style and ambience are rustic/modern! It's dark but definitely well designed!  2) The service was impeccable! It was our first time having pasties and our server (girl I think her name starts with a K) quickly went through all the options. She pointed out which pasties were popular and even excelled with options with flavors we were looking for! All her recommendations were spot on! 3) food was BOMB DOT COM! this place is definitely different than the rest. Fist the jalapeño fries are HOT! And I couldn't stop eating them! The flavors  of my salmon and my husbands pasty were simply phenomenal! Definitely coming again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Is it a bar! It's a restaurant! It's Cornish Pasty Company! Dum do de dum.  The music is superb. Elvis Costello anyone? Yes please. The beer selection while I didn't partake this trip is A+.The food....yes!  I met the lovely Sarah G. here and loudly remarked on her review point of a pasty being \"a glorified hot pocket\" just as our waitress came by. Oops.  English accent? Check.  As stated a brazilian times the chicken tiki masala is tops. They come split in half so Sarah and I traded halves and I also got to try the pilgrim. Definitely amped my excitement for turkey day. both selections were tops.  I want to go here and drink and eat like a king one night.   Sarah changed her tune and decided it was definitely better than her last trip and even grabbed a few uncooked to feed the family that night. How cool is that?"}
{"text":"I really like these little pockets of goodness. Fresh pastry on the outside, savory fresh ingredients on the inside. We tried this place on a Saturday night and left because it was loud with dark walls and lighting felt like a night club/bar (University location). We went back at lunch with my co-workers and I still didn't care for the dark bar ambiance but wanted to try the food because I heard it was good. I had the chicken portobello pasty and it was delicious. As for service, it was average. No refills or check-ins."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have eaten at all their locations and they do no wrong. This I feel is their best one yet. Very homely and it has pool table and darts upstairs. It's their first few days so they have to iron out a few things to find their stride. But this will be a great addition to the downtown food scene."}
{"text":"My friends invited me to this place yesterday the layout is nice I tried the Cajun chicken and ale perfect Combo"}
{"text":"As my British companion said, you won't find these pasties in Ginster's.   There is a huge selection of pasties in traditional and creative flavors, as well as other British favorites. There are a lot of vegetarian options, too. We had the Guinness stew pasty and the vegetarian pesto chicken pasty, and a spanikopita as an appetizer. Everything was good, especially the Guinness pasty. Speaking of Guinness, the place has a hipster vibe and a nice beer selection. I had a Left Hand Milk Stout...always a winner. I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Staff and food was awesome and great place ! It's not fancy and not a fine and dine restaurant but it's what you expect for an English pub style restaurant. Pasty of all different kinds and has a wide variety for vegetarians. This is a must stop in Tempe..."}
{"text":"Delicious at a fair price! Definitely our stop whenever we are in Vegas. Don't miss out on bacon wrapped meatball. It's one you'll remember for a long time!"}
{"text":"Always awesome!!!  The atomisers is very close to an old works pub.  The food is amazing, and the service is always terrific.  I have, and shall continue to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend.  I went there for a late lunch and had the a southwestern style chicken pasty (can't remember the name, but I think it had green chile of some sort), and it was fantastic!  I wanted the carne adovada, but they were out, then I asked for another one and they said it would be 20 mins..so I asked what they had and ordered off the list.  Normally it sucks when the restaurant doesn't have what you'd like to order, but honestly, at this place it just felt so reasonable.  They're making the pasties right there in front of you, so it's not like they have everything at all times.   I dunno, I'll keep the 5th star to reward freshness.  Anyway, also order the oven chips with garlic & jalapeno and that was a fantastic choice.  Added a beer to round off the meal..and it was the perfect lunch.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town (with a car)."}
{"text":"Boooooo!  Walked in, sat at the kitchen back bar area for five minutes, we weren't even greeted.  We figured that we must have to sit around the other side so we got up, walked around and stood around looking lost for another five minutes.  There isn't a way to tell who works there and who doesn't in the sea of skinny jeans plaid shirts and black rimmed glasses so we finally left.    I've eaten here before, the food is pretty good but customer service is more important than food.  I'll take my dollar and properly fitting pants somewhere else."}
{"text":"All my life I thought the Irish were responsible for rainbows. Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:   I became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.  My heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.  All hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley.   As far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going.   After four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again.   Then, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace.   There was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood.   My next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty.   I entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back.   I sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.  It was gold, my friends."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and I am expecting to be back. They have a good beer menu and a happy hour all day Sunday so that's a plus! Sat at the bar and bartender was helpful with questions and getting us our drinks and food. I ordered the Cajun chicken which was great. My brother ordered the Italian and split with me and I regretted it immediately. If you like a little spice, Cajun definitely hits the spot. Italian was good but it didn't come close to the Cajun. Overall good meal and food experience."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the tastiness of these pasties.   I had the vegan \"chicken and cheese\" mushroom pasty (pot pie).... So unbelievable delicious and filling, great beer, friendly ambiance,  good prices, fabulous menu variety.   Wish they'd open up one in Pasadena.   Had a real air of Great Britain pubs, made me miss Cornwall."}
{"text":"Right when I walked in the door I knew I would be coming back. Sat at the bar Cornish had great beers on draft it's like a pub setting. Sneaky spot to take a girl with a deemed lighting. I at the peppered steals and my friend at the Rueben both were housed in minutes. The bartender brought out some dipping sauces the mustard creme sauce took the cake and went really good with the peppered steak. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place, glad to see them expand. Everything I have tasted has been delicious from the tomato soup to their desserts. They have something for everyone. Hope they open a location in phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place to get your pasty fix (or try them for the first time).  The pasty size is pretty big, there is good potential for leftovers and sharing.   The beer selection is pretty good, staff service is good.  Environment is alternative/college kids, not bro scene."}
{"text":"Very good Pasty, I like chicken more than meat. The meat (beef and lamb) taste below average. When you order lamb pasty they will put few pieces of lamb and a lot of other ingredients mostly potatoes."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise! I was coming from class and a classmate and I wanted to get a quick bite to eat before continuing our studies and this place popped up on Yelp, so we decided to give it a try.  The entire place has a very gritty, pub feel which is makes everything feel that much more authentic. We started the night off with a Scotch Egg. The Boiled egg was wrapped with a flavorful sausage, where you can taste the hints of sage in it. The bread crumbs that wrapped around the sausage allowed the egg to have a nice and crisp texture to it. It was accompanied by a creamy, honey mustard sauce, which gave the egg an extra burst of flavor. Next were the pasties. My classmate and I shared two pasties; one Reuben and one Bangers & Mash. Both were very good.   The Reuben was filled with a good share of thinly sliced pastrami and corned beef that were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The pastry that wrapped it all was flaky and not too thick, so the meat didn't get lost in it. It was served with a 1000 island sauce that helped give a different texture to the pasty, while also enhancing the flavors of the meat. The pasty was also filled with Swiss cheese and Sauerkraut, just enough for you to get a hint of their flavors while not overpowering the main star of the dish, the meat and the crust.  The Bangers & Mash was also delicious. It was filled with a house made pork sage sausage. The pasty was filled with a lot of sausage on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and grilled, sweated onions. The different textures in the pasty were interesting, from the creaminess of the potatoes to the bite of the grilled onions and the tenderness of the sausage. This was all served with a red wine gravy, which was light and enhanced the flavors of the meat.   I will definitely be coming back to the establishment; I already can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the mozzarella chicken pasty which was average tasting, nothing special. As an appetizer I got the pasta salad which was REALLY yummy and huge, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place... too!   They have the best red curry pasty i have ever eaten.   I wish you had a place in north phoenix though as the drive is a bit far.   In addition to the pastys i really like all the sides such as the rutabaga, and the stilton soup.  Yum!   This place delivers on all counts."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner were we ordered three pastries. The pastry was great but the filling on all three was very salty.  We had a much better experience at the tempe location."}
{"text":"This gem is truly an amazing example of the sort of eateries that make a city rich in food culture. The pasties and chips are out of this world.The beer selection is perfect. This is a great spot for vegetarians and meat eaters. Great place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Really yummy pasties with an edgy decor. This place is cool and does great food. Not healthy, but there is plenty of kale salad in Phx for your next meal!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Best Cornish Pasty I have had outside of Cornwall.  A hole in the wall place in Tempe that looks like a British pub inside.  Good to go into a dark spot in the heat of the desert.  It's very good."}
{"text":"The venue has multiple levels. We dined upstairs, where there were tables, bar, darts and pool tables. The food was good. Having never had a Cornish pasty, I was surprised that it was firmer and crispier like a calzone."}
{"text":"I went here last night for my birthday dinner with a few friends. It was somewhat busy, but we got seated right away. I was looking forward to eating here as its a UK company and its food i grew up on as a kid in England.  Our server didn't introduce himself, took our order and left.  One of my dinner mates said he seemed to get an attitude becos we didn't order much food and only one drink. He delivered my friends beer and wasn't seen again till our food arrived about 25mins or so later. I was beginning to wonder if they'd forgotten about our meals. The music was also very loud.  The food arrived, but they had dropped one of the meals on the floor so they offered a salad while my friend waited for her cornish pasty, and once more it took a while to get her food.  I'm vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian Greek Cornish pasty, it was horrid, mostly cheese, i didn't like the flavour and only had a few bites as i felt sick and my stomach started to hurt.  Everyone else loved theirs.    Our server was MIA, never came back to check on us so i couldn't order something else.  When he did finally come over (a long while later) to pick up the plates, everyone had finished they food, i told him i didn't like mine, he responded somewhat flippantly along the lines of \"well, you could have gotten something else\". I calmly said Ok I'll have the bread and butter pudding, thinking that might be quicker to get vs another meal. OMG another 20mins or so later that came, Umm the top was crispy, and the inside was dry, no wonder they served it with ice cream!  I had a few bites of that and gave up, so not happy. i didn't eat much at all for dinner!  Ive had bread and butter pudding many times growing up, this was NOTHING LIKE THAT!  An Italian place called Mia Francesca in Chicago has fantastic bread and butter pudding. Being from England, i know what its supposed to be like.  I think the guy who served us may have been called Jay, it was the only name on the bill. We all wished we could have had the other guy who served the next table over from us who had dark/black hair and beard. Our guy had light brown hair and beard. He did take my Cornish pasty off the bill.  Needless to say i was very disappointed with the food and the whole experience. So i wont be hurrying back."}
{"text":"Hands down by far my favorite bar-staurant in town! Great chill industrial homey vibe and decor. Mike behind the bar is absolutely THE best!  Food and drink menu, I cannot rave enough about how delicious everything is every single time. My boyfriend and I have been to this spot for dinner and drinks on many separate occasions and we receive the same amazing service and quality eats every single time!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go for lunch or to kick back with a friend or two!  The pasties are awesome, especially dipped in the wine sauce.  I've had the pleasure of trying about four of their pasties so far, and they have all been up to par in the taste department.  Although I usually go with Guiness, they do have a pretty nice beer selection, and they're priced not too badly!  I've only been to the one in Tempe, so I can't speak for the other location, but I would avoid going with a large crowd unless you want to wait for enough seats to open up to form something resembling a group setting.  Like others have said, there isn't a lot of seating inside and it is incredibly narrow, but I kind of find that to be part of its charm!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Remember when Hot Pockets were the best invention EVER? Well now there's a restaurant that is totally dedicated to a fancy hot pocket filled with tasty treats! Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!  After promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.  On my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy!   Whenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!"}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty on University is very small place. There is more room and outdoor seating at the one in Mesa which is a little farther but worth it also. They have great Pasty's!!! They are truely gourmet hot pockets! YUM!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It has a cool vibe and amazing food. My favorite is probably the bangers and mash pasty, and their red wine gravy is TO DIE FOR! One thing I will say is that their service isn't always the quickest, but the quality food and portion sizes make up for it.   Definitely come here hungry!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: This is a VERY narrow shop in a strip mall that faces Hardy NOT Broadway. There are tables for 2 on one side and a bar on the other with a couple tables for 4 in the back. It is very close quartes. It is painted balck to represent a coal mine. You can watch the guys cooking behind the bar. Cleanliness: It was pretty clean and believe me I am always looking. There is 1 unisex bathroom, my hubby used it and said it was ok. Food: We ordered the Oogie (beef, potato, onion and rutabaga with red wine sauce) and the Pilgrim (turkey/chicken, stuffing, sweet potato with cranberry sauce on the side).  We split them. While good size they do not come with any other vegie, salad or garnish. These were priced at $6.50 and $8 respectively. I would never order the Oggie again because the beef was NOT tender! It was quite tough and the potato and rutabaga were undercooked. The Pilgrim said on the menu turkey/chicken but when I asked the waitress she said it was chicken. When I got it I saw that they use white and dark meat. The sweet potato was cut in small cubes and they seemed dry. It had a good flavor but just was not exciting enough to get me to go back. Staff: The waitress was friendly and didn't mind answering questions because it was our first time. My hubby had a soda and it never got refilled..she finally asked when left the bill. Drinks: Well, this is the best thing about the place! They have an excellent selection of beers and I got a 14 oz Kiltlifter for $3.50 a 20 oz wa only $1 more!! You can't beat that! Conclusion: I probably would not go back unless it was just for a beer, but hey I can get beer a lot of places."}
{"text":"This place is painfully close to my house... OH MY GOD..."}
{"text":"I'm a Yooper-- I was raised in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and left for college.  Ever since (and that's a few years now!!), I have felt the absence of a good pasty nearby.    Totally by chance had this place recommended to me at a business meeting and was BLOWN away.   I'm used to the traditional \"Oggie\" and  it brought me right back to my childhood   but as I went with family, got to try a few bites of some of the others--all were amazing including the Royale.    Love the eclectic crowd too.  Definitely a place to go back to when we're in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Very cool place with authentic food.  Fun, quirky staff who are knowledgeable about the food and care about your experience. The place may not look open but give it a try.  Not well-lit and even the entry doors are not obvious.  Long European-style tables and an extensive menu.  Try it out - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time here at their new location and it's very delicious!! Inexpensive and super good food. I ordered the chicken pesto. Amazeballs! I also tried the Sticky Toffe Pudding... holy balls.. that was incredible! A definite place to check out!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of time. Always a friendly staff and always a great place to enjoy catching up with a friend or group for dinner.  Smaller but diverse beer list. Food always tastes great and is vegetarian friendly. Never a bad choice."}
{"text":"I'm giving only 3 stars for management's information and not to discourage people from dining here.  Went here with a large group of colleagues. Called ahead to let them know of our imminent arrival. Despite the advance notice they didn't have a large enough table ready. Then it took a full half hour to take our orders. Then another 30-45 minutes to get our food. The server distributed bills and collected money before the food was served.   The food was excellent.  The experience with a large group at lunch needs significant improvement."}
{"text":"The Food was delicious, The service was perfect..The Price was Fabulous!!!! You want a great night out for date night or just out with your bestie.. This is one place in Vegas that wont break your wallet and the food is to die for.. we needed something like this in Vegas and now we have it.. Only complaint is that it is a little on the loud side... so prepare for that... But everything else more than makes up for the noise..,"}
{"text":"A refreshing change from the endless chain restaurants and mall-food that reigns supreme in Phoenix.  There's a distinct pub vibe but also the feeling you're getting something extra.  An wow, are the pastries everything we've heard about.  There's a large variety to choose from...the crust was brown & buttery, and the inside was perfectly cooked to the core.  We had the Rosemary Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Masala, both were excellent.  So grab yourself a pint and a pasty and you're set!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I've loved nearly everything I've tried. I will say that I only ever get take out. The restaurant itself is really small and often packed. If you are in the mood for a pasty though this will hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place is so dope. I was visiting town from Cali and Havent been to one yet. My friend took me and I was impressed. The food is so good! I had a Thanksgiving type pasty and it is was delicious. Cute bartender who was friendly and would check up on me n friends regularly to make sure were good. Good service is always a huge plus. check it out!"}
{"text":"This is the second location Ive been to and the food, atmosphere, etc. was top notch. Oh and the drinks were good too. Me n my friends had the rudest server though... so I feel compelled to complain. Im a bartender myself and have been working in the service for awhile so I can be a harsh critic but this was just soooo bad.  She clearly didnt want to be there, which I get, dont let your customers see that though. She did the thing where she would quickly stop by to mumble \" can I get you something?\" before any of us could respond shes already walking away.. Slow down girl, damn. We put in chips with our first round of drinks. They took awhile so after not seeing her for 10 min ,and they didnt show I asked her about them. She said they would come with food, okay no problem. Our food gets there with no chips, cool. I ask the gentlemen who dropped our food about them, he checks, our server never put the order in ?! Why didnt she check on em when I asked her the first time? I think I left her 3 bucks on a 70 dollar tab. Im a good tipper too but I actually have to get table service. I feel just taking the order and dropping the drinks doesnt warrant anything close 20%. Guess she didnt want the money. shitty attitude . HOwever ! some dude in a beanie had a clue , he comped the chips we didnt even want anymore and apologized on behalf of the server. Thanks dude ! Whoever you are !"}
{"text":"This place is worth going to at least once, but there is a lot to be desired. The food was pretty good. I had the Philly cheesesteak which was honestly not something I would recommend. But based on the reviews of those I visited the place with, I think most of the \"Pasties\" are probably pretty good.   It's a very young college crowd and the place definitely has a trendy vibe to it. The waitress was very nice and that was probably the highlight. The biggest negative was the fact that the place felt quite dirty. Its probably a good thing the place was pretty dark. I think that is intentional to hide the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Expanded space and multiple locations deserves more stars! :)"}
{"text":"Fries were burnt to shit. Jalapeños were so burnt they were black. Service was terrible. Over priced for nasty food."}
{"text":"Baked Fries are yummm and Shirley Temple Pudding is simply Out of this world decadent."}
{"text":"I came in for something savory and something sweet. This place did not disappoint and the price was fair. The Caramel Apple pasty was amazing !"}
{"text":"The Lamb and Mint.....need I say more. Having always loved this type of food, I have to find myself down there every now and again, just to stop in to grab a pint and pasty."}
{"text":"Great food-CHECK Great vibe-CHECK Great staff-CHECK Theres not many places that will make me go and have more of their great food two days after i went for the first time. Until a few weeks before i went to the Cornish pasty i didnt even know what a pasty was....until my Michigan roommates told me. So i gave it a try, what hooked me was the spicy chicken asiago pasty, its out of this world....i think their crust is their main key ingridient, its tasty, light and flaky. My second time there i tried the chicken masala and it was great for my spicy taste but it may be too spicy for most people. I also had the cajun pasty and it was equally great, the ham inside have it an unexpected pleasant flavor. If you havent been there, you are not making yourself any favors, this hole in the wall is every bit as good as its 5-star rating and prob more!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving a Runza (a favorite food from my hometown of  Lincoln NE), this place takes care of it. They have a wide variety of fillings anywhere from lamb to a wonderful vegetarian selection.  I've been to both locations and they have always been very consistent. FYI, Runzas are also known as Bierocks of German origin  (savory filling of meat, onion, and cabbage)."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Stumbled into this and such a welcomed surprise! Had the Shepherd pie pasty. Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! I usually get the bangers & mash, the oggie, or occasionally the pilgrim. The pilgrim is a favorite among some of my friends... it's like a wrapped up Thanksgiving meal! Goes great with a beer."}
{"text":"I have to say this place was pretty good! It was the first time I've tried this kind of food. The dishes were a good portion. The waitress was nice and the environment was relaxing.   The only thing I'd have to say is to make sure to sit inside the restaurant. We had people smoking heavily who sat at the booth next to us and the waitress didn't do anything about it because they were her friends."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the food-- we got stuff to go from here. Ordered the lamb and mint pastry and the chicken mozzarella pastry. We also got the chicken tandoori salad. When we got back home and set everything up, the tandoori chicken was there but there was no sauce and no salad--- just two lonely pieces of chicken--- so much for that dinner!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you see the kitchen, which is open to the front dining area. The rest of this pub/restaurant is open and airy, with minimalist decor and an edgy feel.  The pasty crust is lighter in texture than it looks, which is a great surprise. That, paired with a great beer list and even better liquor selection, makes Cornish Pasty a must."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I have gotten the cottage pie, shepards pie, Guinness stew, and the tuna one. A lot of vegas locals know about this place and you won't see many tourists there. The dim lights make it a good date spot. $3 coors banquet all day for those of you looking for value."}
{"text":"Well I am from England and I think this place is totally awesome.  Yes it`s cramped tiny and hot. But the pasties make it up for it. Absolutely great, and I`m English and I should know. Don`t tell your friends though because this place is busy enough already and it`s often hard to get a table, and I want to make sure I can get in."}
{"text":"Excellent location with open doors and windows to the sidewalk patio on Monroe St. Relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff and great comfort food. It's a welcome addition to our downtown neighborhood. Long time coming but very well done and glad to have this pub to go to as a local resident."}
{"text":"My friends and I came for lunch on opening day, and everything was perfect! Great service, very cool vintage-goth decor, and food amazing as always! Excited to come here again. Thanks for exceeding my expectations, Pasty people!"}
{"text":"It's so goood how do they do it...I'm vegetarian and this place is awesome. All the fake meat actually tastes/feels like meat. It's hard to pick a fav pasty, but the shepherds pie was pretty flockin bangin....must..have...pasty."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy in there.  we were able to find somewhere to sit right away but it took them awhile to get to clear the dirty table and ask us for our drinks.  I ordered the lamb vindaloo.  I was told that it was the spiciest pasty they had but had not hint of spicy in it whatsoever.  I was looking forward to a very spicy meal.  My husband ordered the cajun chicken which actually tasted spicy.  Next time i'm going to have to ask more question.  The Arnold Palmer's don't taste like lemonade at all."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder if I am too much of a hard ass when rating restaurants.  As I am hesitant to give 5 stars.  Well it is places like this that puts my mind as ease that someone can meet my discerning standards.  I left this place totally satisfied except maybe I never wanted my plate to empty.  I had \"The Porky\" which has Pork, potatoes, apples, onion, and sage. With a side of red wine gravy.    I am a big sage fan!  Everything was perfects about this pasty.  The texture & quantity of bread/crust/dough (whatever you call it!)  was spot on.  The ingredients were very flavorful and were cooked perfectly (not overdone, soggy or watery which can be the situation sometimes especially with potato).  The red wine gravy was very savory and rich!  YUMMY!  There were many other pasty variations that were interesting that I will definitely try in the future.  I will be back for sure the next time I am in Las Vegas.  Customer service was great also.  This location may be a little hard for a visitor without a car.  The strip mall this place is located in has seen better days (at least I hope it has not always been this bad).    Go get your Pasty On!"}
{"text":"Gut busting guilty pleasure food with a huge selection of draft beer. Pasties has carved out a unique niche for themselves. There's really nothing else like it. And with the recent expansions, adding a classy sit down side, and a grungy dive bar side, this place smears the cultural divide line in a great way."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is FANTASTIC, the ambience is cozy, the beer selection is unmatched, the deserts are a force in and of themselves, plus the staff is the coolest and best around. They make you feel like you're an old friend. Don't let the exterior fool you, go inside and love it."}
{"text":"Was my favorite hole in the wall place years and years ago.. cheap irish carbombs, huge strongbow and that was before you tried the amazing food!  I am still partial to the chicken alfredo and end up getting it almost every visit!  They have definitely grown since I first started coming in, the food stayed awesome and the venue just became much nicer!  Definitely a great place for lunch, afternoon drinks, dinner or a late night snack..  Great for pregame on the way to mill!"}
{"text":"I thought I had posted a review for this place! This place is A-Ok!  Husband and I have been here a few times and I really love it...him...not so much :)  I really like how they have vegan options but I'm not going to lie I always call ahead to make sure they have the ingredients. Sometimes they do not have the vegan dough.   I think this place is ok. The garlic fries were really good and the off menu southwest vegan pasty was excellent because they used Teese cheese and not Daiya. Otherwise the gooey Daiya items I would pass on.   I liked the portobello one so I will just order that using the vegan dough and no cheese next time.  I'll have to come with friends next time because after a few times of trying this place out the husband will not come with me again. It's just not his thing."}
{"text":"They are still in the process of their soft opening so they have a limited menu. Luckily \"The Pilgrim\" was there which is my go-to and it was delicious! Food took a bit longer than I'm use to but again they are about a week open. I'll be back soon to see how they run with the full menu and if they can pick up the pace. The atmosphere is perfect, very nice flow through out and reminds me of the Mill Ave location the most. Bright and open on the main floor, dark with a large bar up top. I didn't get a chance to look around down stairs but was told their is additional seating. It was a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This place was really cool and unique. The ambiance was chill and fun with the pool table and a few other games. The food however made me and my nephew sick! I had the Oggie and he had the Royal. Both tasted fine at the time, but made us sick later."}
{"text":"Sandra Morgan and I went to Cornish Pasty Co this past Sat. Having read the reviews on Yelp, expected it to be pretty good... We were very pleasently supprised that they surpassed the reveiws and were absolutly wonderful!  We had the Chicken Tika"}
{"text":"This is not the normal type of restaurant I would go to but I was dragged there by my wifey and I was pleasantly surprised. First off, they have real good selection of pasties... and for that I mean empanada type hot pockets w/ all kinds of different items.  The Good, I had the rosemary chicken pasty and potato wedges. The server was very friendly and on top of things for us. Parking was also a breeze.  The bad: The ambiance was absolutely horrible. It was pitch black and hard to maneuver. The layout was great but too dark to enjoy. The service was great for us but the table next to us was ignored for a long time. Lastly the potato chips were pretty bad. Not sure why the wedges were so good but these weren't edible.  Lastly the bill was not as painful as other places I have been dragged to so I will be back."}
{"text":"I saw this place while on travel. My grandmother used to make these and so i was hoping they tasted like what she made. I wasnt disappointed with the traditional pasty!  And the red wine gravy is awesome."}
{"text":"Great bartenders (Hoku and Mike), great food, darts and billiards and great location. Perfect place to visit at any time. From breakfast pasty's to chicken masala pasty's Cornish has a variety depending on your mood.  Out of all the new bars in the Art District this is by far my favorite. They have a fully stocked bar Mike went as far as making us a scofflaw which was not on the menu. Also, they stock High west whiskey which is hands down the best whiskey in the West.  Bottom line, this place is yuge, the best, great place to chill from hipsters, tricksters, hippies and maybe even Trump supporters."}
{"text":"So... Great food. I had the pepper steak. It was like a pot pie you can eat with your hands. Delicious. Seriously though. The kitchen areas need a serious cleaning!!! It freaked me out a bit but I am still breathing. And cover the food on the racks. Seriously!!! Four stars for the food cause it tasted awesome."}
{"text":"One of my go-to's! Whenever I recommended it to a friend and they ask what a pasty is, I describe it as a fancy hot pocket. I know that may not sound tempting, but you'll be happy that you tried it.   I love going with people because that means I can get more than one pasties - one will fill you up! Some of my favorites are: The Mexican, Carne Adovada, and Chicken Tikki Marsala.  It's definitely worth a trip! I have gone to all 3 locations, and I have never had a bad experience. The vibe at the one is Mesa and this one in Tempe is more college-y and grungy-like, but the one in Scottsdale is the opposite with lots of great outdoor seating and an outdoor bar."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a few times and I've had take out from here once. The service is always top notch and the food is delicious. But the atmosphere is what loses one star. Of all of the locations, this has such a different vibe. Not bad and it definitely has a time and a place. But this location take divey dark to a whole new level.   Favorite: Rosemary chicken and always, always end with a banoffee. There have been many occasions I just called to get a dessert to go. And they have delicious iced teas! Always a perk.  Conclusion: filling and delicious and definitely worth your time. But you won't be needing to wear your sunnies in there or you may not be able to see your meal."}
{"text":"Yeah!  To die for deliciousness... Authentic pasties... Even better than many Great Lakes Pasties!  Not bland.  Must try this place."}
{"text":"Really good pasty! I've been here once for lunch and would definitely go back again. For our sides (which were huge) we had Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese and Broccoli & Cauliflower Cheese Bake, served hot and delicious. For my pasty, I chose to have the Chicken Tikka Masala. As much as I loved the flavor, it was on the inside in a couple spots. That didn't stop me from enjoying it though because I was hungry. We sat outside since it was dark inside the restaurant and we wanted to see and appreciate each others' beautiful faces. :)"}
{"text":"If you're in for something different around the valley, give this place a try. SO many different pasty's to choose from & the fries are true British pub chips- very good! The atmosphere is fun & 'bar like' and the beer pairings are good too. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend after an event, and still kind of hungry. Located in the center of the commercial center area, next to the Tokyo Japanese Restaurant.   Apparently this place is super popular in AZ and since it opened in Vegas, we decided to try it  The interior decor is like a normal bar, dark with the bar in the middle, tables surrounding except with an open-style kitchen. The seats are the unusual thing. its like.. formed to your butt. well at least mine anyway... apparently it was uncomfortable for my friends (small) XD  Since we weren't really hungry, and the waiter said each of these pasties were dense and weighed like a pound each, we opted to get 1, and share. Then dessert afterwards (as per recommendation on yelp xD) Since this was our first time, we ordered \"The Oggie\" which was their traditional pasty, which had steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (type of turnip), with a side of red wine gravy.   When the pasty came, it was already split in half, on two plates (+1!). I tried picking up my half.. indeed it is heavy and pretty dense. but the pastry crust looks sooooo good !  the inside was filled with the ingredients i had listed before... there was a LOT of potatoes, and not that much steak in my half. The red wine gravy was nice, a little sour like you'd expect from a sauce reduction made with red wine. The crust was super good and flaky. not too buttery. For me, i would have preferred the filling to be a little more seasoned. Seemed a little plain for me, even drenching it in the red wine gravy.   As for dessert, we had got the Banoffee subbing the bananas for strawberries (my friend doesnt like bananas). Its a very simple dessert, made with a sugarless heavy whipped cream, cut fruit, a crushed graham cracker crust on the bottom, and a homemade caramel. Not being a fan of caramel, but this was actually surprisingly good. Since its a different type of caramel, it wasnt sticky, like sticky to the teeth or roof of your mouth. Took my head quite a while to wrap around the concept... simplicity and different, but good. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it, after slightly struggling to finish her half of the pasty. For those who want to try something different, i recommend trying this. quite inexpensive too. $5? good to share with.   Overall, not bad. I'd like to come back and try their other pasties. Something with a stronger flavor like bangers or spicy asiago chicken or the reuben.. *stomach rumbles while finishing this...) dang if only it wasnt so far ! XD"}
{"text":"MMMMMMM.......Hearty food in a flaky crust. What else could you ask for? My favorite is the royale with cheese. Basically a cheeseburger with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and potatoes. But it's so much more than the description. For some reason, everything just comes together perfectly in every bite. And add a little barbecue sauce...bliss.  I've never had a bad pastie. The oggie and shepherd's pie are classic. The italian ones are good. The apple one for dessert...better than apple pie. Banoffee pie is great too.  Portions are big. 1/2 is a good meal. Eat the whole thing and you'll be stuffed.   Don't take impatient friends here. These things can take a while to bake!"}
{"text":"Awesome unique food, great beer selection, great service and a good atmosphere! A friend introduced me to this place a few months back and now on my third visit with many more to come."}
{"text":"Nice design- Food was good only 2 vegan option. Service at the bar was slow & yea should have sat at a table-"}
{"text":"OMG! Pasties in the desert?  Yes yes yes. . Absolutely the bomb.  Banana bread beer. . Ginger beer. . Omg!"}
{"text":"Great English pub. I had the Chicken pot pie, the wife had the Cajin. We shared the Broccoli cauliflower cheese dush. All were great. Chicken pot pie was some of the best I've ever had!     We will go again.     Sarah, our server, was the bomb!!! Hard working young lady"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time today and I loved it! The restaurant was so cute, and the food was delicious! This way the first pasty I've ever had and it was great. The service was fantastic, our waitress was actually british so that definitely helped. I hadn't heard of the place before but it was really crowded. I will definitely be going back here multiple times"}
{"text":"I've been here two times on a weekend and it's been very crowded and noisy inside.   Fairly quiet outside and the temperature was nice outside at night for a change.  I had the shepherds pie the first time... not my cup of tea... an acquired taste in my opinion.   The second time I had the cheeseburger inside a pot pie.   Not bad at all!!!   The prices seemed reasonable and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"We made the trip up to Phoenix as soon as CP opened because we were dying to check it out.  It definitely did not disappoint, the space is amazing and every level is different and well done. The second story was full when we got there but we were still able to find a table against the wall for three.  Everyone was BUSY but our server promptly brought menus and waters and beers soon after.  Their beer list is pretty impressive, nicely varied.  But we couldn't wait to get our hands on the food as we'd practically starved ourselves all day in anticipation of this visit.  We ordered the Cornish Meatballs and Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese to start.  The meatballs are wrapped in bacon and covered in sauteed onions then served in a white wine mustard gravy  - every bit as delicious as it sounds.  For the Pasties I had the Chicken Pot Pie for the first time, I've tried a few others and this one is right up there on my list of favorites.  Basically a pot pie filled pasty with a side of rosemary gravy, awesome!  We all had a great time and enjoyed the delicious food and cold beers.  I have been back since and will continue to stuff my face at this location, it is the best!"}
{"text":"The pasty is such a unique dish! Have liked all of the pastys I've tried; the Pilgrim  is probably the tastiest, though! Cool decor with church pews for chairs; the lighting is just a bit too dark, though."}
{"text":"Always great food, though I personally think the Tempe location has better service and atmosphere, but that could've been a one time incident, either way it's a must have in phoenix."}
{"text":"Happened across Cornish Pasty after a show at the Crescent Ballroom. The shepherd's pie was the perfect home style meal after a long day of work and a late night at the show. The downstairs captures a mellow speakeasy feel. The upstairs has darts, pool tables, and a pew style seating area. The UK style menu has savory pasties (pastry case with beef and veggies) and even some Indian style dishes like chicken vindaloo. Cornish Pasty offers a great atmosphere and is perfect for a date or evening with friends."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I started at ASU in 2006 and it's one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in the mood for comfort food. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all been amazing! The last few times I've been the service was a bit lacking. They weren't super busy and it took a while before our server came to greet us and take our drink orders. Otherwise Cornish Pasty has been a regular on my list for 10 year!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over a year now and I love the food, although the service has always been really slow; the quality of the food has always made me overlook the servers, but yesterday I felt so discriminated against and very disappointed.   I went to Cornish pasty at around 4:30 PM with my service dog, and someone approached us and told me I would have to sit on the patio; I politely told this man that my dog is a service dog (he was wearing his working vest and everything) and he proceeded to point out that my dog was a pug (which he is indeed) and that we must sit outside because only service dogs are allowed inside. I very nicely repeated that he IS a fully certified SERVICE dog and he once again pointed out towards the patio.   Since my boyfriend's sister was in town from Louisiana and she really wanted to try pasties, I decided to be the bigger person and walked myself and my service dog to the patio.   I am honestly really disappointed because my dog should be allowed to go anywhere with me, and I feel like just because he isn't a lab or a German Shepard or a more commonly seen service dog he is not taken seriously, but he is fully certified to assist me, so what happened was extremely unfair and maybe illegal?   I most likely will not be visiting any Cornish Pasty in the future, but would like to let others know that this establishment does not respect individuals with disabilities."}
{"text":"Excuse me. How in the world have I lived walking distance from Cornish Pasty Company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem?! Thats what I want to know.  A friend introduced us to Cornish Pasty saying it is \"the best restaurant ever\". I best give it a try then right? The Tempe location is smaller than the Mesa location but I LOVE its vibe. A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables, dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part, pretty good music.   My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty. They were unbelievable! SO GOOD. The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but I'd order both of them again any day. A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy. I respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options. What generation are you living in if you don't offer veggie options these days? Get with the program all you other restaurants. You know who you are!   I loved the entire experience and can't wait for our next trip."}
{"text":"Finally open! Thank you sweet baby Jesus! Loved the Tempe location & Old Town Scottsdale but it was a hella drive from the West Side. So I love that this location is open in Downtown PHX. Great food & staff. Brittany is hands down the best server they've got. Always smiling, quick & knowledgeable about the menu. I really enjoy that they change it up with the menu & have special Pasty's. I had the corn beef on St Patty's before the night began & it hit the spot. Of course the reg menu isn't a schlep at all. I just like it when the chef has some fun. Can't wait to get back to this location. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible and unique! My friends took me here and I really didn't know what to expect. They're food is authentic, gourmet and so delicious. The menu is also simple to follow and everything I tried was great. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a treat to be in Phoenix for work and to have a throw back Cornish pasty and Scottish egg!!! They had the British original as well as some new flavors but they were awesome! Amazing flavors and great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Every time I go visit my dad in AZ a stop a Cornish Pasty Company is needed. Anything you ever hoped and dreamed about in a warm flakey crust has come true. They have alot of options from a thanksgiving dinner, to a hearty Italian feast and even peanutbutter and jelly. I've enjoyed everything I've had here and love that they have a good selection of microbrews to wash your pasty down with."}
{"text":"Amazing food and quick service. Feels like a taproom or bierhaus inside with big bench seating. You may meet new friends when it's busy because they seat to capacity and You will share that big table.  The pasties are available to cook at home as well.  There is NO PARKING!!!!!! You'll be parking far and walking here."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Greek pasty and oh my goshhhh it was so delicious! This is my new favorite spot to eat. So delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So sad 13 of us went yesterday . We tried to make reservations but they don't take them, but they knew we were coming. So why were they out of everything. The primary pasty Ogie, was not available except to take home . Every drink we ordered was out, more than 4 different ciders were out! At least 6 different pasties were out. Every single Vegan item on the menu was out!! We ordered anyway. The food took 1 and 1/2 hours to come!! Seriously, if we were not a group we would have left. However we stayed and had other drinks and other pasties. Did I mention when one of us asked for a pint, the waitress asked what size, 16 or 18 ounces. I could have sworn a pint was a legal measure! The Food  was OK. We were enjoying ourselves so we ordered a bottle of wine, when finished we ordered another. Guess what ..they were out! So they just alienated the British Ladies group, who probably could have generated more business for them than another group. Shame, this place could be good."}
{"text":"Such a good restaurant with so many menu options! I'm thankful for all of the restaurant expansions so now there's usually little to no wait time when I visit. My favorite pasty is the Cheese & Onion. Always order the red potatoes as a side dish!  Also, their catering manager is super helpful and responsive!"}
{"text":"Dark and ominous. Love the setting. The service was okay. The bangers and mash pasty was a letdown. The garlic fries were good though. I'll come back and try a different pasty."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Cornish i feel like I'm in Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. It is very \"hipster\" , but in an awesome way. Everyone is super friendly and the food consists of a calzone type pastry with various different options for filling. I haven't had something I didn't like, though my favorite is the italian."}
{"text":"What a great place. The concept is very new and unique to me. Great prices, atmosphere and friendly staff. Its basically a sandwich inside of a puff pastry and heated up."}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in pasties, they take a year to make one. 40 minutes later and I was like one of three customers they had. 6 guys doing all kinds of stuff but the simple pasty order took nearly an hour to be served. Save your time, a Shepards pie isn't worth wasting your entire afternoon. Probably could bake one in the same amount of time."}
{"text":"Having just moved here from Phoenix, AZ my Husband and I were SO excited to see that Cornish Pasty was coming to Las Vegas. So we finally decided to stop by last night. I had a very fleeting thought that \"What if it wasn't as good as the Tempe location? Oh no!\" But those fears were instantly diminished upon entering the establishment. The staff was very, very friendly. The dark lighting and the bar style seating with simple wood benches for the tables is pretty similar to that of Tempe. I felt like I was home again.  As for the food, it was just simply amazing as always. I have never gone to a Cornish Pasty location and been disappointed.  I ordered my favorite the Lovely bit of Salmon, it is served with a dill sauce on the side. The pasty itself is just great, but combined with the dill sauce is an experience.  My husband ordered his favorite the Royal with Cheese and upon taking the first bite his eyes lit up like a little kids. (he always orders this with a couple sides of the red wine gravy although it does not come with it) We actually ordered to go and ate the pastes in bed, lol.  You just really cannot go wrong ordering anything off of the menu here. They have a great list of draft and bottled beers as well.  So excited to see this establishment expanding!"}
{"text":"This was not my first visit. I've enjoyed myself on previous visits but this time ... not so much. Pros: the waitress was good, kept my water filled repeatedly without being asked and checked on me regularly...reflected in her tip.   Cons: I really like curry so I ordered the \"curried potato\" side dish with my pasty. I wanted to like them, I really did but they were so salty as to make them inedible. The waitress apologized and took them off the bill.   The \"bangers & mash\" pasty was great but again the small cup of gravy was too salty to be edible..and I'm a guy who eats salty foods.OK, I didn't need the gravy.   My desert pasty arrived without the accompanying ice cream or cream sauce. The explanation was that the fridge unit with the ice cream apparently went down ....the ice cream was all melted....sorry here's your pasty without the rest of the desert.   Brandon (manager) stopped by my table;  he started out by saying he understood there was a problem with my ice cream...I had to explain that the ice cream wasn't served at all...he seemed surprised. He acknowledged that I clearly should be disappointed if the full desert described on the menu hadn't been served .... Got me my check...the full price of the desert was included on the bill.   I paid up and left. I know if I had asked him to reduce the price of the desert he would have done so...but frankly after visiting my table and learning that half of the desert dish hadn't been served, I shouldn't have had to ask."}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly bartender that served us. I'd recommend the Royale with cheese! Everyone at my table wish they had ordered it as well, but they enjoyed theirs also. The serving is enough for two meals, I'd highly advise asking for an extra sauce and a to-go box from the get go. The nitro-infused Guinness was an excellent pair with the pasty. Very laid-back atmosphere, with a dark red glow throughout the bar. Excellent choice for late night grub, I was not disappointed with this place whatsoever."}
{"text":"I've never had a pasty before, but some friends took me here.  Walking in, the place has a certain cozy charm. It is pretty small, a bar in the center with tables around the outside.  So a pasty is like a calzone or an empanada, basically just a meat pie. The ones here are pretty big and filling.  I ordered the lamb vindaloo, because that sounded good and spicy. I found it to have good flavor, and it was well prepared, looking very appetizing.  However, it was so large that by the end of it I was pretty sick of it. If you want to try out any of the more exotic pasties I would recommend going with a friend and each of you tries half of one.  I also had oven baked fries topped with jalapenos, and they were pretty good.  Noticed that they had a few soups on the menu that all sounded good, but I had already ordered a pretty big meal so I didn't get to try.  I am sure I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm....  Oh, if you haven't been here, then you are missing out.  This place is awesome.  The pasties are delicious.  Think super gourmet hot pocket.  They also have a great beer list.  My work makes it here once a month, I go with my fiance once a month, and I will sometimes take home 1/2 baked ones for the following day."}
{"text":"Not sure how to describe these - white person's empanada with every kind of filling possible? They didn't agree with my stomach. I don't think I would come here again. But they do have ..."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother and gf. The service was meh. There was barely anyone in the place and we waited awhile for drinks and our check. The location in Scottsdale is 3 times better than this location. The food was okay, my brother seemed to enjoy his Guinness Pasty and my gf liked her vegan pot pie. The oven baked fries were the bomb. 2 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas, i have never heard about a Pasty and would never have ventured here without Yelp.  I mean, I only get out to Vegas once or twice a year if I'm lucky and if I take the trouble to leave the strip and come to this strip shopping center and not go to LOS, I've got to be crazy, right?  If you've never had a Pasty, I would describe it as a big empanada or maybe hot pocket - but 100x better.  And they have so many choices, you have to wonder how good they will be.  Let's just say they were so good, I came back to eat here twice during a 3 day stay!  On my first visit, I had the Cheese Steak pasty.  It had sirloin steak, onions, green peppers, mushrooms & Swiss cheese and it was awesome!  Piping hot, the bread was I couldn't decide between a side of red wine gravy or mustard cream sauce, so my waiter offered to bring them both.  Pro tip - get the mustard cream sauce.    Next visit, I had the Peppered Steak pasty, which was made up of sirloin steak, sautéed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini, and Stilton cheese (Imported English bleu cheese).  It came with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce. It was very good, but I give the nod to the Cheese Steak.    They had a very nice selection of beer on tap, Firestone Walker, Ballast Point, etc.  The staff was friendly and they played a nice, deep cut mix of rock music (e.g. Eagles of Death Metal, Black Keys, etc).  I can't wait to come back and try something different, maybe a Carne Adovada, on my next visit."}
{"text":"We were looking for something a little different when I found this gem. It was around 10pm, and they are open late! Really cool looking little pub. Warm wood, dimly lit, and friendly staff. The Pasty was delicious especially with the red wine gravy (I could almost drink that stuff). The only bad thing I can say is, I think it's a little pricey for what you get, they should throw some fries on the plate or something. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"This place is great in many ways. The food is tasty, I don't feel its overpriced and all the bearded people working there is nice enough. With that last statement I don't mean that the service is bad, it is enough i.e. not circling you, but checks in with you now and then. I like that. I also like their laid back style, and they're attitude that goes along with a unconformative beard. I like this brand service.  Since I barely knew what a pasty was, I ordered the Oggie, the most basic of pasties. It was good, but I can now see how more elaborate filling is better. Next time I will throw some more spice in there, and yes there will be another time. I really enjoyed it, the whole experience. I liked the atmosphere, and the food... and the fact that they have some cool English beers is also a crowd pleaser, if you are my kind of crowd. So food and drinks goes without complaint.  After a pasty and a couple of beers I was full. Completely full. Sense dictates that I shouldn't have been this full, but I was. Totally worth the visit, and as well as I might not become a regular - I sure will become the occasional returning visitor. I guess I'll end with - come here, support this establishment, not that they need your business - but you need to try a pasty and a beer experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cornish Pasty Co. The Food is excellent and they have a decent drink menu. I'm not a Vegetarian but the Vegetarian pasties are AWESOME. I sometimes order the Veg. version over actual chicken a lot of the time."}
{"text":"This place is a Tempe staple!!! I love the atmosphere, low-key decor, and pasties of course! You have a variety of pasties to pick from, but my favs are Sheperd's Pie and the Mexican."}
{"text":"This is authentic Cornish Pasty.  We love having a little piece of England nearby.  English ales, English type soups, and the pasties.  Oh, and yes that sticky toffee pudding is a must order.  Go, you won't be disappointed.  And if it's your first time, sitting at the bar is a great idea so you can watch them create the pasties.  It's amazing."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall and a must-know amongst Sun Devils.  This place serves up pasties which are essentially the original hot pocket.  They have a wide variety of them from vegetarian to carnivore and none of them will disappoint.  Great place to meet up with a date or a couple friends if you're looking for a good bite and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.   They always have a huge variety (including a wonderful vegetarian and vegan selection). It's affordable and always delicious. It's a great place to meet up for happy hour or take out-of-town visitors. All locations have a different ambiance but the menu is consistent throughout."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! If you're having a diet cheat day, like I was yesterday, then this is where you want to eat. The pasties are always amazing but this was the first time I had dessert. We got the Chocolate bread pudding and it was to die for! The staff here is also fantastic. Jess was our server and she took great care of us. Thanks for the best cheat day ever!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the broccoli cauliflower bake. The staff is very helpful and  knowledgeable on the menu items and offer suggestions. The dipping sauces on the side are too die for . They even have vegan. Fresh ingredients. I had the chicken pot pie tonight and you can taste each ingredient. The pies are big I still have half of mine leftover too take to work tomorrow for lunch. And of course to show and tell this yummy food . The prices are great. A must go too!"}
{"text":"This comes close. As a frequent visitor of London I long for my Chips and Mushy peas. I love the decor of the place to begin with.  The seating could be a bit more comfortable but the lighting and the hipster feel of the place is strangely calming. The menu is massive and surprisingly includes an entirely vegetarian section as well. I usually order the Mexican which comes with choice of vegetarian beef or regular. I decided to give vegetarian a try. I was certainly surprised. We ordered an appetizer of curried potatoes and baked beans and they were amazing. Finally we finished the meal with some beers and a desert of bread pudding. My one complaint is that they still don't have mushy peas. However, this is one of the few places that I insist on taking people new to the east valley."}
{"text":"I can't believe that this place is so close to my office and it took me three years to finally stumble across it!  After having read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot once I realized that they actually do have a fairly extensive veggie-friendly menu.  Despite not being a fan of fake meat products, I decided to try the veggie asiago chicken pasty and was pleasantly surprised.  The brand of \"wheat meat\" that they use actually had good flavor and an unusually normal texture.  The pasty also contained corn, black beans, hatch chiles, stewed tomatoes, and was not overwhelmingly heaped with asiago cheese.  The salsa that was served on the side was flavorful and a nice accompaniment to the already spicy pasty.  The crust was flavorful and flaky, just like the pasties that I remember getting growing up.  The only drawback is that the place is incredibly small and between the loud music and the conversations of other customers, my ears were ringing by the time I left.  The food is certainly worthwhile, though, and I think this may become one of my regular take out spots for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow!  Here to visit family, but my wife and I snuck off and enjoyed a little piece of heaven tonight.  We loved the meatballs as an appetizer, then had the Cajun Chicken Pasty, both of which were divine.  We even split the Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert.  We are still able to move, barely, and both more than happy with our meal.  Terrific time, we really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Great service with reasonable rates.  Try any and everything, even my wife likes it here."}
{"text":"We decided to head downtown to Cornish Pasty to get some English food and celebrate the Royal Wedding. My husband and I started with a large Greek salad. Our friends started with a bowl of potato leek soup. The salad was huge with large chunks of feta cheese, crisp lettuce, fresh cucumbers tomatoes and onion. The dressing was delicious and the large salad would easily feed three or four as a starter. The soup came with 4-5 slices of bread and our friends said it was delightful. We each ordered an  individual pasty. I had the chicken rosemary, my husband had the meat and cheese and our friends had the chicken pot pie and the Guinness. I'm not quite sure how to describe these pies. I can't compare them to theirs I've had because I've never had one before but I can say they were outstanding. The crust is similar to that of a pie but sturdier. The filling in each pasty was perfectly balanced so as to be moist and juicy but not so wet that it would be hard to eat. Each of the pasties came with a side of sauce or gravy. The flavors were outstanding. My chicken rosemary pasty came with a Dijon sauce while My husband's meat pie came with a red wine gravy. We were stuffed after eating half of what we ordered and boxed up lots to take home. Even though we're were stuffed we had to try some desserts. Banoffee pie, sticky pudding and a pavlova to be exact. Each was outstanding and again, way more than one person could eat. We boxed up most of the desserts to eat later as well. I highly recommend this great place. Service was outstanding and the food is tremendous."}
{"text":"Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \"grunge\" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about eating here, stop thinking and GO ALREADY! The only downside is that you will be addicted and find yourself craving the pasties on a daily basis. IF you can call that a downside. The new location is stunning and true to all of the locations NO TVs (love it). The space is massive and they are still working to create additional seating in the back of the restaurant. It's not just an expanded space, but the menu has expanded to include more pasties, appetizers and sides. The bar has gotten an upgrade too with a larger selection of great drafts and liquor. There are two pool tables (free play), darts and even more of the coolest restaurant staff you've come across (yes, your favourites from the original spot moved to the new location). I organized a get together for 35 people and it went off without a hitch. Don't let fear of downtown parking keep you away. There is  plenty of street parking on Main Street or Casino Center and in the lot across Charleston."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pre-made so if you are allergic to something or don't like an ingredient inside the sandwich, it can't be \"made without.\" Or at least that's what the waitress said. I went with a group of 6 and at a slow time however the food took 45 mins to come out.  On the upside, I ordered a Greek salad and I have to admit it was one of the best Greek Salads I've ever had, the dressing was amazing. The prices are decent for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty has quickly topped my list of favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I love unique foods with intense combinations of ingredients and flavors. Cornish Pasty offers just that. A few of my favorites include the Chicken Greek, Chicken Pesto, Cajun Chicken and Italian. Also, their scotch egg is a nice small yet hearty appetizer to munch on. Service can be slow sometimes but it's mainly due to how busy they can get. All in all a great place to eat and hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I last visited this location ( I have been going to the outstanding Mesa location ).  I was glad to see that they have expanded.  In addition to the previous area with the long narrow counter there is now a much larger dining room.  There is still a bit of construction going on and when driving by at night the blackout on the windows makes it appear closed which was a bit confusing.  The food takes a bit of time to get at both locations, but it's very much worth it.  They have a pretty expansive and varied menu ( all contained in pastry ) with lots of options for vegetarians.  Our waiter was very nice and checked on us to make sure our beers were full and we got everything we needed.  This is a very unique and awesome restaurant.  Try:  - Egg Plant Parm - Veggie Cottage Pie - Oggie"}
{"text":"Great place!!! It's a little hole in the wall and not clean, sorta divey but the food is great and the employees were nice. We got our drinks asap. Drinks were reasonably priced too. Yes, I agree with others that this place is hard to find in the parking lot. But we called them and the guy on the phone gave us easy directions and we got through the parking lot maze!! We've never tried British food before, glad we did! Will be back next time we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cornish Pasty multiple times, but was compelled to write after going in this last time. Things just got THAT much better at Pasty with the opening of their additional dining room. The lack of seating was my only previous complaint, and I look forward to being able to bring large groups there.  They have a helpful staff, and I enjoy the Chicken Pot Pie pasty the most. ALSO--get the banoffee pie and add ice cream. INSANE."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Very good food for a moderate price. The Mesa location looks like you are in an old church, with candles on the tables. You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Quality of the food is pretty good, although the location is not ideal the food and the service makes up for the bad location. I would definitely try the other Cornish pasty with other fillings my wife had the Chicken pesto and was  impressed with the flavors. This definitely is a must try place."}
{"text":"One of the coolest, most delicious, places with great taste in music and ambiance in all of the Phoenix area. I love this place! One weekend night, I'll have to come up here and check out the live music."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Cornish Pasty in quite some time.  I used to travel to Phoenix for work often and would always stop by for a quick bite.  Glad to find out that the pasties are stills as tasty as ever!  It's a pub so the space was a little dark and grimy.  Service was okay, however, our waitress seemingly forgot about us when a group of her friends came in and sat at the table next to us.  On this occasion, My bf and I shared the meatball, while I got the chicken tikka masala and he got the carne adovara (spelling?).  I had a bite of the carne and it tasted good but wouldn't have been my pick.  It tasted kinda like a flaky, crunchy burrito.  We also got the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  That was delicious and not as sweet as I feared so yay!  I can't wait to go back and get the lamb vindaloo!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here before the May First Friday Beer fest. Located downtown in the arts district. Construction in the area but tons of patrons around.  We were so hungry so we each ordered a pasty. I had the roast beef and he had the pesto chicken. our meals came out fairly fast. We sat at the bar with the expectations of getting something to drink.   Well, we exchanged one pasty for another just to try each other's. Man, these were so good and filling. The side sauces they came with complimented each item. The pasty was delicious and these creations were perfect. I couldn't decide whether I liked the pesto or the roast beef more.   The pesto pasty reminded me of a calzone but with flakier breading? The roast beef was savory and delicious. My friend liked the roast beef more.   Needless to say, I have to come back and try many other food choices the next time.   We were actually too full to even order any drinks. We probably could have shared one and it wouldve been perfect.   The service was great; friendly staff. Ambiance was that industrial bar/ solo artist/band combo. Loud if you're right up at the bar next to the musicians. As I mentioned, I will definitely be back to try other pasty's on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great food, I have tried many things on the menu and The Pilgrim is one of my favs. I ordered The Royal once at the one on Dobson wasn't much of a fan of that one. (Think I prefer the taste of a burger on a bun rather then in a pasty.) Last weekend was my first time there since the remodeling really like the extra space now and a great looking new bar, they keep the same feel dark feeling which I think is great. However the other half, the old half, seems a little too dull now and could use a little attention."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty was very good. They have daily vegan pasty options and big beers. And I think it was Iron Maiden playing over the speakers while we sat outside and enjoyed the nice spring weather!  Friendly service. The spicy vindaloo pasty was pretty good. To be completely honest I wasn't blown away by this particular pasty, but it was good enough to make me want to come back and try more of their veg and vegan options. Just the fact that they have these options was very nice for me!  My dining companions were all pleased with theirs, but nobody really raved about it.  I would come back if I were reasonably nearby, but probably wouldn't drive across town just for this."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place! It's our go-to spot when friends are visiting from out of town, as the food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. We like to sit upstairs with the views outside and you can even play a couple rounds of pool, for free. As for the pasty's themselves, we have not been disappointed. I've had a few different options, but my favorite is the carne adovada, while my husband prefers the Cajun chicken. And they have a great selection of beer. Great place to go for a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"wooo hoooooo! as good as it gets is right ! !    .. we have been to this restaurant 5 times already !   The Pastys are all deliciously prepared, exactly like home cooking! I have eaten The Bangers and Mash, Shephards Pie, Lovely bit of Salmon, ( very tender salmon, the dill sauce? I could drink it !)   Chicken pot pie, ( best I ever had )    The pilgrim ( Thanksgiving wrapped up in yummy flavorful, goodness !! ) Sausage salad, roasted potatoes, oven chips, Cream of leak soup, mushroom, walnut & spinach soup ( which is the the best soup EVER!)  , each pasty is simply yummy!! from the homemade fillings, to the perfectly prepared bread they are baked in...... and the sauces are delicious!    you must go eat here.. it is the best food I have had in a restaurant in a looong time !!   each one has its own flavor and I cant wait to try them all :)   the desserts we have tried are : Apple caramel pasty.... perfect  flavor and a large portion to share!   peanut butter and jelly pasty...  must be ordered with the whipped cream.... it is the best idea for a dessert and the best flavors :) I have been to London, these are definitely the real deal  Thank you   Cornish Pasty you guys are the best! your food is the best, and all of your servers are extremely nice and professional , and the man that always sings......... hes great !! ***** 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind and it is awesome!  I am a pescetarian so I was pleased to see so many hearty vegetarian options for me.  I tried the vegetarian cottage pie and it was delicious.  I don't like meat (other than seafood), but I am often envious of my husband when he gets entrees such as beef wellington or pot pies when we dine out.  I enjoy those hearty types of meals at times, but they are hard to find without meat.  I have been wanting to get back here to try one of the many other vegetarian pasty selections from the menu.  This location itself is very large and offers alcoholic beverages and billiards as well.  It has the feel of an English pub which I love!"}
{"text":"Very unique, flavorful and a nice change from the usual pizza, burgers and salads.  There are so many different choices of pasties ranging from breakfast to dessert and everything in between.  Each one we tried was very good and couldn't wait to try the next.  There is honestly something for everyone, no matter what your taste or diet.  Staff was very friendly, customers were having a great time singing to the music and I can't wait to return to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The staff were very friendly. Service was great, and the food was amazing. The ambience was a little noisy, but if you were there with someone you can drown out the noise. There was a good mix between age groups, but I seem to see more of the younger crowd coming in to eat. I had the Bangers & Mash, chicken pate, wings, oven chips, and broccoli& cauliflower bake. For dessert, we had the toffee cake and ice cream. Eating that dessert literally made our entire day lol. All of our food tasted flavorful, but unfortunately there were feathers still in our wings, but the waitress took it back as soon as I told her and got us a new order. Will definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has been on my \"must try\" list for quite some time, but since it's pretty far from where I live, we hadn't made the trek down there... until now... since we had nothing better to do on a lazy Labor Day weekend, we got in the new car and headed down to give this place a try. It was a drive, but BOY was it worth it!   Love, love, love the unique vibe of this place. It reminded me of Bison Witches (near U of A in Tucson), but WAY better. The inside was small, but we made it before the lunch crowd so it's all good. We ordered the bangers n' mash and chicken tikka masala pasty. First of all, the pastry is awesome.. I'm pretty sure anything stuffed into that would blow your mind, but given they have a huge selection of great inserts that only increases the loveliness of the pastry. I'm not sure anything is better than a cold beer and one of these bad boys. They are so unique and extremely well done.   This place is a keeper for sure... I can't wait to go back and give some other varieties a whirl. Based on the reviews, I've got to sample some dessert as well... yay!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Highly recommend this place!!! Many varieties of pasties to choose from. Great open view of the kitchen where they make them right in front of you."}
{"text":"Great place to meet or hangout. Good ambiance, drink selection, and foodwise it's something different.  Was not my favorite food, which is why four stars. I thought the original pasty had a bit too much potatoes and the beef was overcooked. I've heard the chicken masala is the one you want to get anyways. Also not very filling as a main dish, but for the price it's a great small dish to go along with your beer, which they have plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Love the cider! They also have an entire page dedicated to vegetarian menu items!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Cornish. It's always delicious! I have yet to have anything bad. The food is fantastic no complaints there.   However, I would NOT return to this location on the basis the service was subpar. We arrived for a friend's birthday party, said our hellos and made our way to the bar to order our drinks. It was 20 minutes before any of the bar staff acknowledged we had arrived to order. We had two people receive drinks before us.  After we finally made our food and drink order we promptly received our drinks that were delicious and mixed well. If you've ever been to a Cornish you know the food takes a bit of time because they make it fresh when you order it which is why I love it here. Unfortunately, with making our drinks the bartender forgot to put in my order into the till. So we saw orders come out of the kitchen but were told no one submitted the order at all. After mentioning that we were not going to take the food after all. The bartender sounded very annoyed at the thought that I declined the food.   I understand it's a busy time of the night and everyone feeling flustered at how busy it is. I've been there, but customer service should never suffer because of it."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!!  I just had dinner at Cornish pasty with my two buds and all I can say is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  Had my all-time favorite, the Pilgrim. Can you say thanksgiving?? All my favorite ingredients wrapped up into one sweet tasty package. Turkey, sweet potatoes, etc.  I do not recommend the banoffee pie, but this is strictly for religious reasons.  Shirley temples pudding is to die for. I would probably not go anywhere else in town other than this place for the treacle.  Also, the waitress was pretty cute.  This place almost makes me wish I was a Cornish pasty."}
{"text":"We had a late day with our family of four, and pretty much everything was closed... so we found his place and WOW!! We decided to come here both nights we were in town. They have some amazing appetizers: the bacon wrapped meatballs are fantastic. They were the hit of our entire family.  The pasties were incredible we have multiple but the Mexican and the Chicken Pot Pie were the favs. We also tried the salads with Tikka chicken that was solid.   The place is casual and open late. Good music and plenty of room for bigger parties. We'll definitely be back here again next time we're in town.  I only wish they had one of these in San Diego! ;-)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We tried it at the old location, and weren't too impressed, but everything about the new location is better... Including the food. We tried the plowman's platter, which was delicious cheese was really good, and we loved the pickled onions. The leek soup was phenomenal... Definitely a must try. My husband had the Royale with cheese, which was filling and decadent. I stayed with a more classic choice, the Steak and Guinness, it was perfect. The pastry on both of them was crispy and light. I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  The GPS for the address will lead you astray; it's around the side of the building. The interior is very dark and a bit foreboding, but the outdoor terrace is beautiful.  The Ruben style pasty was very good...be warned come hungry!  Portions are HUGE.    Service is friendly and very prompt."}
{"text":"Five stars for Cornish Pasty -- for being something a little different, for having tasty food AND for having about a dozen choices for us vegetarians. I LOVE that this place offers their pasties with Quorn (fake chicken). I've had both the Veggie Rosemary Chicken and the Veggie Tikka Masala with it and they are both awesome. Yes, it's loud, sometimes it's dirty and sometimes the service is slow -- but I'll gladly put up with that for a taste of their pasties. Also, Cornish Pasty is a great place to take out-of-towners -- they love it!"}
{"text":"After MANY visits here, I thought I'd update my review. :)  I'm a regular and the place is consistant. Food is always great. Extensive menu, don't forget to flip the menu over...there's a whole other side!   Some fantastic Vegan options. Vegan options are also extensive, which is typically tough to find. Food served pretty quickly as well. The staff has always been more than good. Very knowledgable on products; beer differences and pasty ingredients.  I'd give it the full 5 Stars, but the old wooden church pews can be hard on the bum when sitting for a while...and the room can be a little warm (but not hot) during our warmer weather."}
{"text":"Deserves to be on TV. Amazing. The food the atmosphere the kitchen set up all so perfect."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  Didn't like their wings but all the pastys amazing. The hard boiled egg with sausage and bread crumbs amazing.  Will be here every time I come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have finally found my happy place: Banana Beer, bar seat, on a weeknight, solo.  Walked into the dark and swanky-looking bar area, and immediately got myself a Wells Banana Bread Beer- fabulous start to my evening, highly recommend. I'm not even a beer person and I finished it before my food came out, and seriously considered another. It's more than I'd usually spend on a beverage ($6.50) but well worth it.  Opted for the cream of leek soup  ($3 cup) and the Royale with cheese pasty ($9). Soup was smooth and creamy, flavor was pleasant and Stilton was pronounced. The bread and butter it's served with is delightful- thick, dense bread with plenty of smooth butter.    Pasty seemed to take a while, but it was worth it- stuffed full of beef, mushrooms, onions, and cheese, it really hit the spot. Gourmet Hot Pocket indeed. Crust was buttered and delicious without being too thick or getting gummy, stuffings were hot and complemented one another. Menu mentions several dips it can be served with, I didn't mention one in my order but was brought a dark reddish sauce- based on taste, I could not tell if it was a light house-made ketchup or an odd barbecue sauce, but either way I did not use much of it. Might suggest the Thousand Island as more complementary.  Service was attentive, prompt,  and polite. Most of the staff is skinny white guys with tattoos and vintage clothing, and they're all surprisingly quiet but very sweet. Whoever's in charge of the music is great: went from Metric to bluesy country and it was all well-selected.   Definitely coming back- tempted to chill at one of their smaller tables all weekend with a banana beer and a bunch of papers to grade. Want to try the rest of their soups, and quite a few of the pastys too- as good as my meal was, I think this is a place I'll constantly be trying new things rather than sticking to one dish."}
{"text":"Came in late to get some pastys to go, staff was super friendly while we waited, which wasn't long considering they were pretty busy. Love having these in the freezer to make an easy dinner. Definitely looking forward to dining in soon!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and it absolutely never disappoints. The atmosphere is awesome, the entire experience is unique and offers something very different and enjoyable that stands out from the typical dining out options. The food is fresh and the selection will make your head spin. Wish I could find a way to rate it 10 stars but five will have to do. Can't wait for our next visit!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  I went because of the delicious pictures on Yelp of the Ruben sandwich and it was amazing.  Home made 1000 island dressing and sauerkraut.  The pastry was perfectly cooked and flaky."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they don't accept reservations & don't split checks. :-( When I called to make a reservation they informed me that they didn't take reservations but could do separate checks.  Which was fine - we just went in earlier than we normally would since we were a large party. However on arrival found out they don't do separate checks. I had explained to the waitress that when I called they said separate checks weren't an issue & that was what my group was expecting based on what their staff told me. She said she'd check if they could do separate checks & fortunately since it was early enough & not busy they would for us this time.    Ordered the Lamb & Mint pasty & was very disappointed. Had no mint flavor what-so-ever. I am not sure if the dipping sauce was supposed to be mint but it wasn't. I love mint & also lamb & was used to having lamb chops with mint jelly as a kid. Crust was very flaky though & that was good. Overall the pasty was bland. I should have stuck with the other reviewers & gotten the Chicken Tika Masala or Lamb Vindeloo. Fortunately there are enough other pasty's that I wish to try on their menu that I'll be back. Everyone else in my party love theirs (except the other person that also ordered the Lamb & Mint). 3 star rating since the waitress was gracious enough to split our checks this time for us & she did do a great job keeping up with our table. In this day & age it's so simple with the pos systems to split checks I don't see why they wouldn't do it. Yes it might take a bit more time but it also will almost always guarantee more of a tip for the server if everyone was having to pay their own bill & not figure it out from one where people do forget to add in all that they need to (right amt of tip & tax, etc). I won't go back there with a large group for sure since check splitting seems to be an issue."}
{"text":"Very cool set up.   Dark, British, churchy.  There are a lot of options so take your time going through the menu.  Each of us ordered a different option and we were all very pleased. They have a great selection of vegetarian and vegan options and a nice beer/cocktail list.  Lots of on-tap choices.  Would be a super cool option for food or just drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Really cool joint with comfortable vibes and music. Great selection of beers.   I never had this kind of food before but I must say I am a fan. It is a bit saltier then I was used to but I'm telling you it was so freaking good. I got the Tiki Masala and it was not bad! Tasted like a tiki Masala in sandwich bun form. A bit strange eating it with your hands rather then scooping it off a plate. I tried some of my friends Royal with Cheese which is their burger version and this might be a good one for someone who doesn't want to get all wild with their tastebuds.   They also got darts and a pool table up top. Come here for great a night of company, conversations, beer, and food!"}
{"text":"After having dinner here I can't say I'm hooked. My wife loved her pasty but I didn't feel the same way about mine. I had the Italian Pasty and there was a good amount of meats like salami, capocollo, pepperoni, ham. It also had mozzarella cheese and came with a side of marinara sauce. The inside of my pasty was really good. I didn't like the \"hot pocket\" type dough so much though. Before my pasty came I grubbed on some Oven Chips with jalapeno. The oven chips were very greasy and somewhat burnt at the same time and I didn't like that the jalapeno easily fell off since there was no cheese or gravy to hold it all together. We were eating with yelper Loon E and his woman and they felt the same way about the oven chips and found their dishes to be too salty.   Our waitress was nice and took good care of us. I can't say I'd hurry back next week but since my wife liked her pasty and you can order them for pick up to take home and cook yourself, I might give a different pasty a try."}
{"text":"Dark, cool ambiance. Chill vibes. Great booze assortment. Authentic British eats. Delicious everything. Friendly staff. Fair to $$$ pricing. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Feel free to eat here if you want to feel like an inconvenience. Honestly the worst service I've ever experienced. The bartenders don't seem to understand that they're working for tips."}
{"text":"I love love Cornish. They have great beer and delicious food (with vegan options!). The new location is beautiful and the customer service is always great. This is definitely one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  My boyfriend and I went recently on First Friday. Surprisingly, we were able to sit right away. I was really impressed with the customer service we received on such a busy night. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 10x in 5 months! The food is great, service is quick and friendly.   You will enjoy"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant while at First Friday and it was surprisingly really good! Our group has never had a pasty before nor did we even know what it was but we decided to try it and it was delicious!  The restaurant itself can seat quite a bit of people, with seating on either side of the bar which is centrally located. The kitchen is open so you can actually see cooks making the food. The restaurant had a very industrial and \"church\" like décor. The seats at the table reminded me of Catholic church benches.   We had the Cornish meatballs and parliament wings for appetizer and they were delicious! For entrees you can honestly find anything to put inside of this pasty! We opted for the Cajun chicken and pesto chicken, both of which were filling. We got the chips which are similar to fries and the garlic mashed potatoes which came with an au jus sauce (that was different but we liked it a lot).   The dessert was my favorite with the Banoffee Pie which is caramel, graham crust, and bananas. We devoured it! The housemade lemonade it a bit sweet but also really good.  I would def come back to this restaurant as the servers were friendly and the food tasteful."}
{"text":"Well was going somewhere else but they were closed on Sunday. So back to Yelp I went and found this place ! Reviews looked good and so did the pix!  I had the Oggie (cause I couldn't decide). It was very good! Only ate half cause I ordered the mushroom soup with walnuts etc. you get two pieces of fluffy bread and butter with. Omg took half of pasty home.. brrrrp! BF had Lamb n mint. He thought it was bland. Oh well hard to please everybody. He DID enjoy the Greek salad tho so it wasn't a total loss.  My Bro had the peppers one and he was quite excited how good it tasted. He ate half and was debating to take it home and ruin the re-heating or just eat it... he ate it!!! Being full of course we all shared one chocolate bread n butter pudding with ice cream. So now we are all happy and overfull but satisfied to an extreme ! It was so delicate but had that crunch on the outside like fresh out of the oven. And the creamy vanilla ice cream was a perfect wash for it all. Ok now I'm done.."}
{"text":"Five star ratings are so obnoxious and hard to trust.  So you ask yourself, is there anything better than Cornish Pasty Co. for what they do? No.  Five stars here no doubt about it. Service is great (you seat yourself and they will handle it from there). Nice place outside, great bar, great tables inside. I actually recommend the bar with a friend. It's a great place to relax.  The food is incredible. Their choice of Pastys is expansive. I've had the pastrami and hamburger. Both were very filling. The apple dessert was delicious. Just a great experience.  Note: They refunded my check one evening because I was double charged. Offered me a round of drinks. Honestly, they earned their five stars with me."}
{"text":"Who knew this place even existed?   I was feeling quite sick and couldn't decide what would satisfy my soul when my roommate suggested we get some soup. Little did I know what a cool scene I was walking into or I would have probably changed out of my pajamas. In reality, NO ONE CARED about my attire, the lighting was dark and the seating was said to be from an old mine however it reminded me more of a church.  The people that work here are super chill, they were playing AC/DC's, \"Let there be Rock\" and the pasty's reminded me of an Australian pie.   The soup was fabulous and they give you tons of bread which is delicious to dip or butter! They've got pasties on pasties on pasties to pick from as well. I decided on the vegan eggplant parmesan and although I was under the impression I specifically asked for no cheese, vegan or not, I received it. Hey, mistakes happen it was what it was and I wouldn't order that again but even if I wasn't going to eat, its a low key hipster bar scene for sure, and i'm all about that."}
{"text":"The food was great, I specially loved the soup. I love how dark it is, it's a nice place to hide from the summer heat. It took a lil while for us to get served but the waitress was very nice and friendly. We weren't looking for fast food so that wasn't a problem."}
{"text":"We didn't eat here, so this review is purely based on customer service.  Entered Cornish Pasty Co with a large group on Saturday night and asked if there was an area large enough to accommodate our group.  We were told by the hostess that the main floor and upper floor were \"full\" and that we should not bother trying to get seated.  At this point, we were considering leaving.     ...On a whimsy, we went downstairs to check the space out, and it was largely empty.   The server downstairs was rude, stating that it would take 45-60 minutes to get food (so why bother?), and not to order drinks from him but go to the bar instead.   From the minute we walked into Cornish Pasty Co we felt the workers were discouraging our business."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and all were okay experiences. Depending on the pasty I get, I sometimes feel ripped off, but the last time I came, my family shared six different pasties and tried a little of each. There are some awesome ones, some not so great, but good.   The first time I got the Greek/Mediterranean one, I loved it. Last time I tried it, it was so/so and no one else liked it. Some of the ones I liked were the curry chicken, the cheese steak, and the hummus bean dip is really good too!   Last time I came, the server was very slow and we had to flag him for refills and such, but sometimes the service is great. Also, I love the concept of sharing tables (European style), the atmosphere, and the concept of pasties. It's not something you find everywhere.   I think I'll need to try it another time to determine whether it's 4 star worth; right now I'm feeling a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"Be careful with the ghost pepper sauce. Food is great I try to get something different every time I love the vindaloo and the Ruben. Servers are cool and friendly. The kitchen guy with the side burns is the coolest human ever. I always take my friends here from out of town for something different."}
{"text":"Well. This has been my worst experience at a Cornish to date. We got here as part of a group event in the upstairs bar and were among the first to arrive. We took our seats at the end of the bar and waited 20 minutes for someone to take our beer order. Another 30 minutes go by, empty glasses, and we are unable to get a drink or a menu. People walk right by us. We finally flag someone down (a really rude blonde woman) and place our order. Another 30 minutes go by and we have no food and more empty beers. Unable to Flag her down again, our food arrives only it is wrong and we still have empty drinks. It takes 10 minutes for us to tell a server our drinks are wrong and another 19 to get mor drinks.  As I write this, we are still awaiting our food and we have been here almost two hours.   Usually I love this place and I come here a lot but this is unacceptable and makes me want to find another place. :/  Aaron, the manager was great. He was very nice and apologetic while we were there and followed up with us via email. I'm hoping to get back in the next week or two to update my review."}
{"text":"Great taste and unique set up with a hip vibe and great wine, beer, and cocktail selection. Will be returning often!"}
{"text":"Good service and great food! I had the veggie chicken pesto pasty and it was amazing. You might consider splitting one if you plan to have dessert. They are quite filling. For you fellow vegetarians, they make their Pasties with Quorn brand faux meat and some without. The chips were great and don't let the appearance or name throw you on the mushy peas.  That was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"I went in for my birthday with my boyfriend I asked for a candle for the table, one because it's dark in there and hard to see the menu and two, because it was my birthday and I thought it would be cute to have a candle lit dinner with my boyfriend, even if it was at pasty.  The server went over to her colleagues and really loudly anounnced \"that table asked for a candle, where the f*** do they think they are, a 5 star resturant?\" Obviously not. They all began to laugh. At least make fun of me where other customers can't hear you. We walked out."}
{"text":"Banoffee?  Yes please!   Thanks Roger and Riah for topping off the night with an amazing dessert! I had it bookmarked to try it, they suggested it...  so let's go!   I was excited to try their famous pasties - entree and dessert.  They had warned me how huge these are so with a party of four, we split just 1!  We chose the pesto pasty that was filled with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms and of course pesto.  The crust that envelops the ingredients was different and delightful! It's a not a pizza crust type but had a lighter flaky texture.  Delicious!  On the side we split one of their huge side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes with cheese.  I love garlic and this did not disappoint.  So to the banoffee.  As it was explained to me ~ if you like banana cream pie, you'll love this! Graham cracker crust, house made caramel filling, whipped cream topped with sliced bananas.  Yum!  I fell in love immediately.  So delicious and huge dessert!  There is definitely enough to share especially if you are eating a full meal here.  We didn't just have one dessert to share, we also tried their caramel apple pasty that is served with vanilla ice cream on the side.  As if I didn't have enough to eat already, this again was large enough to share amongst us.  This was also pretty good but I'd stick with the banoffee.   It was a different setting inside with church pews for seating at the tables. The people on some of their pictures followed you wherever you were.  We've all seen these.  The waitress was ok but nothing over the top.    I will say I'm excited to bring more people here to try these tasty pasties!"}
{"text":"Found out some of my coworkers had never been to a cornish pasty so I got online and couldn't believe this one was here! I have been to the Mesa and Scottsdale location and this one was just as good! We picked a spot upstairs in a cozy booth and relaxed while we waited for our pasty. They told us it would be about 15 minutes because they make them fresh and we enjoyed our drinks. Everyone loved theirs. I had the adobo and it was the right blend of cheese and sauce and pork. Came with sour cream and salsa. We got banafee pie for dessert and it has become one of my favorite desserts. Service was good, place was packed, they maybe could have used one more server but someone else came grab our checks so it looked like the manager was helping out to get everyone out in a reasonable amount of time. Not a great place if you are in a rush for lunch but it is worth the wait! Great meal, good service, cool relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for fresh homemade turnovers pasties head over to the Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe which is right next door to Rosita's Fine Mexican Food. Once you arrive you will notice two entrances the one to your right is the original restaurant with bar stools. And the entrance to your left is the new addition that has a bar and table seating.   Since all of the pasties are made from scratch be patient you will wait 30 minutes for your order but they are so worth it. All of the pasties come with a side sauce or dressing ranging from red wine gravy, mint yogurt, tzatziki, tahini, to peppercorn brandy cream sauce.  Since I love spicy food I normally get the Carne Adovada or the Cajun Chicken.   Carne Adovada $9.50 Simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar. With a side of sour cream and salsa.  Cajun Chicken $9.00 Spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss. With a side of chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"I was absolutely impressed by this diamond in the rough.  The pasties are all baked and filled with delicious ingredients. The baked fries are great but be careful, their jalapeños are no joke-incredibly spicy.   I thought the balsamic mushroom pasty was my favorite one and would def get it again.  Their immigration chicken is s little rubbery and needs some more seasoning.   The ambience is so unique, you walk in and everything is dark with black out curtains. Your eyes adjust though!  The study behind the pasties is on the menu and should Def be read! It's an interesting tale.   I wish they had a place like this where I live because it was like no place I've ever been before!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere. The pastry I had was ok but better after being re-heated. I want to go back and try at least 3 other pastries."}
{"text":"Amazing pasties and an overall awesome place. It's open late so if you need a good restaurant when everything else is closed definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the coworkers for the first time and checked out their new location on Charleston, I believe they used to be on Sahara.  The place is big and lots of seating, even had construction or a big empty space in the back that for sure needed to be filled in. First impressions regarding the interior and feel for the place would be creepy, dark, gothic, and you cannot miss the church benches (it's the main seating arrangement). Not a bad thing because I don't know any other places with this style or idea so it's unique, but I'm not really a fan.  Came here for the food anyways, lol! Tried the following menu items: Chicken Pot Pie - I was expecting more saucy/soupy texture on the inside, but got the chicken a little too dry. I mean you can ask for more chicken gravy that it comes with but it wasn't that good to me. Eggplant Parmesan - Like a little vegetarian pizza in a pasty, very tasty and smelled so good! Oven Chips w/ Light Garlic and Cheese - Crispy, oven baked fries, by itself they add just sea salt and cracked pepper. I added light garlic and melted cheese, good but I didn't like getting an overwhelming taste of the cracked pepper in some bites. Sticky Toffee Pudding - Saved the best for last! Really comparable to the Gordon Ramsay Sticky Toffee Pudding! Served piping hot, like still boiling when it reached the table, with a side of vanilla ice cream!  The pasty dough itself is really good but I guess it's just picking the right filling to really enjoy your food. Also, all pasties are about a pound each so it's really filling!  Will for sure have to try the other items on the menu!  A minus on my part, and it really does bother me when employees at restaurants do this, is our waitress didn't give us our receipt. I mean we came in scrubs, so it was obviously a work lunch, and you can almost always assume that these business lunches require receipts all the time! I had to ask for the receipt, took a while to get it, but regardless.. Everyone paying should get a receipt. Just saying.."}
{"text":"Yum!  Saw this on \"Check please, Arizona\" and have been wanting to try it for a long time!  Luckily, my friend loves this place and invited me to join her.  They've recently expanded and also have an outdoor patio area.  The inside is dark and super cozy.  You can still see the kitchen from your seat which is pretty cool.  Great selection of beers, too.  My friend and I ordered two pasties then shared them.  We got the chicken pot pie which was yum and the chicken pesto which is my favorite.  I wish I had room for desert because I'd love to try the carmel apple pasty!  Will definately be coming here again!  Our server was super awesome and nice, too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The staff is super friendly and the food is excellent.  I love the vegan options too!  The only problem is when they run out of the pasty I wanted to try but that's really nothing to complain about just means I need to get there earlier next time.  I always like to get a pb&j to take home for dessert later too.  The portions are huge so I usually can't finish my meal but pastys make for good left overs.  My favorite is the chicken marina."}
{"text":"Whenever a group of us is planning on getting together for dinner in the Tempe area, it's only a matter of time before Cornish Pasty comes up. It's kind of shocking that we have been there so many times and can honestly say that we have never gotten anything that has left us disappointed!  A few of my go-to pasty choices are the Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Portobello Chicken. All though the fillings are great, my favorite part of the pasty is the soft, doughy, yet flaky outside. They seem to bake each one to the perfect golden brown! One pasty is pretty large, so depending on how hungry I am, I sometimes finish the whole thing but most times have some leftover.  They have a pretty extensive menu and the choices are so unique there's literally something for everyone. If you're vegetarian then you'll definitely be in luck because they have a whole list of vegetarian and vegan options too!  Unfortunately, the only dessert I've tried at Cornish Pasty has been the Shirley Temple's Pudding. It was so delicious (with both the creme anglaise and ice-cream) that I can only imagine how the rest of the desserts are! I definitely recommend saving room to get something.  Overall, the service is also good but it's a popular spot so they get pretty busy. The patio is large, great for groups to enjoy the Arizona weather during the cooler months, and also it's dog friendly! We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"We went there with a friend to have some desserts. Tried couple of them as well as an appetizer (finger food) - curried potatoes.  All the food was very good, the service was timely and good. I can imagine that it can get a little more crowdy.  This is a real nice place to hang out in Tempe and I will try their menu items soon in the future."}
{"text":"What an awesome find in downtown Phoenix. Chicken tikka masala pasty was awesome! Flaky crust, well seasoned filling, and just delicious.  Sat at the bar, watching the chefs/bakers hand make each of their various pasties.  Everyone in the place seemed happy, and the variety looked amazing."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty never dissapoints.   Thanks to a really good friend, I am now in love with this Irish style \"calzone\" made at Cornish Pasty. With their very wide selection of Pasty's and alcoholic beverages, it provides an enjoyable meal.   Personally I am not eating meat at the moment, so having such a wide variety of vegetarian/vegan options makes me incredibly excited. AND THEY TASTE SO GOOD TOO!!!   I was excited to find out they carry leek soup, which is one of my mom's favorites and its sooo good here :)   Tip/Warning: all pastys are made ahead of time so they can't take things out of them.   Otherwise, I hope your experience is as great as mine has been :)"}
{"text":"This place has always delivered the goods.  I have been coming to this location for about 5 years.   The food has always been good and the service is always great.  I had the cottage pie this trip and it was awesome.  The wine sauce that it is served with is great.  The pastys are made that morning so they are always fresh."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service not so good. Every time we order and go pick it up through the door that says \"pick up\" I wait there for 6 mins , someone finally says do u need help?  Then I'm directed to another door to where I enter and wait another 6 minutes to get my order. Not just once but every time. Seriously put up a sign as to which door people should enter. I was going to just email the manager as a courtesy but when I asked an employee for a business card he went to go ask and the person he asked had an attitude and said no. So there u go. Get a clue people."}
{"text":"These pasties are huge.  I mean they're bigger than Janet Jackson's breasts, and they are a steal at $7 or so.   So for value, quality and portions this is probably among your best bets in Tempe.  Punk rock and British pub grub are predictable and go together like PB&J, but Cornish Pasty is probably one of the more distinctive restaurants in the Valley for its niche of pasties in a quick service restaurant/diner setting.  My buddy was in town visiting and staying in Tempe wanted something unique for the area.  Given that he's used to Mexican, I opted for Cornish Pasty since it was nearby.  My friend couldn't finish his Oggie, with steak, potato, onion & rutabaga, but I couldn't resist polishing off the Cajun, blackened chicken breast, bacon, ham and swiss, served with an addictive side of chipotle sauce.  Spicy, but not overwhelming, but a bit on the greasy side as a warning.   The beer selection here is admirable, and had we not had to go back to work for the man that day, we would have certainly indulged.  Kronenbourg, Boddington's and Strongbow on tap, plus your expected hipster brews available by the bottle: Chimay and Rogue among them. The setting looks diner-ish with its long narrow strip mall set-up and open kitchen.  The atmosphere here is dark and weathered, but not dumpy.    The difficulty here is deciding on a pasty.  I could have easily gone for a meat and cheese, a Mexican pasty, or chicken tikka masala. Luckily, our server was very knowledgeable about the different pasties as we couldn't make up our mind, so his recommendations were well taken."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious. I tried the vegan pasties, a veggie one, and a few of the desserts. I'm sure you can't go wrong with much on the menu.   That being said, I'll explain why I'm giving three stars.  My girlfriend called two separate times (one several days before, and again the day of) to confirm reservations for her birthday dinner. When we showed up, there was no table reserved for our large party. After quite a bit of confusion, we were seated and our server brought us menus and water, which was great...but it took him about 15 minutes to come back to take our cocktail order, and it took us nearly 20 minutes to get our cocktails. Our party was large, so I understand not everything can be speedy. After he dropped off our drinks, it took him another 20 minutes to come back to our table to take our food order. They were out of a LOT, I mean a lot, so I suggest going early in the day if you want more variety. I am extremely patient when it comes to waiting on food, especially when I hear if it's good. I expected that to take the longest, and it took about 25 minutes for our food to arrive. It was delicious. I don't think a single person in our party had a complaint about the taste of the food, everyone loved it. Finally, when we asked for the bill, our server told us he could only split it three ways which was fine but something he should have told us from the get go, as it caused a lot of confusion. Our server seemed irritated to be serving us the entire night. A large party isn't ideal but it's frustrating feeling like you are a burden to somebody who is supposed to be making you feel welcome.   I would love to try this place again, as I'm sure my experience would be much different than this one.   Don't come here with a large party at night, lol. If you want the best options on the menu come early."}
{"text":"Delightfully unique.  Great pub with very interesting cuisine.  Glad that I came, but may not be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"A little bit of Phoenix/Tempe followed me here.  People try and use hot pockets as an analogy for what a cornish pasty is... and they should just stop that.  It doesn't compare to anything else, it doesn't taste like anything else, and you won't understand it until you eat it.  The dish cornish pasty has a history, that I can't remember otherwise I would tell you so go on a wiki spiral about it one night when you have insomnia.  Anyway, the traditional pastry has a wide selection of Brit fillings... and super creative fillings pulling flavors from other cultures.. like vindaloo and  tikka masala.  I love the rosemary steak.  There are sides like curried potatoes, oven chips we like to dump garlic and jalapeno over, and broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. Everything here tastes great, the menu is idiot proof.  The beer selection is good, the music is good.  The location is in some sketchy post-Korean town shopping area that has gone downhill and some businesses are hanging in there or trying to revive it, I'm not sure. I just know the main Korean establishments are sprinkled through Chinatown and not in that complex off Sahara anymore.  I keep going on tangents.  You don't know what a cornish pasty is until you eat one.  Go eat one."}
{"text":"Fridays night, 6pm, party of 5.  No problem! We were visiting from out of town and wanted something different.  It doesn't look like anything from the outside.  It's in a strip mall with a Mexican restaurant.  We almost didn't go in, but my college kid liked the looks of \"the hipsters\" sitting in the patio.  It's dark in there, but very stylish.  Service was fast and Jillian was great. The beer list is extensive and reasonable... $8 for 32 oz Guinness.  The pasties were big and delicious for about $9.  Us girls only ate 1/2 of our pasties and took the rest home.  We left room for the yummy desserts.  5 of us split 3. So good we may come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The food is so so, I am not too impress with it, Howeve, the environment is good and the waitress is good too. I am not going to be back for the food."}
{"text":"Great find ! Food is bursting with flavors, good choice of beers available , good size menu. Chill atmosphere . It's away from all the noise . Food is fresh! They hand make mostly all their items."}
{"text":"Great location downtown for lunch. I ordered the cottage pie pasty and it was delicious. I kept half for the next day and it was still delicious, not at all soggy because of that awesome crust. Can be busy at lunch but service moved pretty quickly. Looking forward to going back and trying more options on the menu."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Cornish Pastry and the food was overpriced for lunch and the service was below average.  The waitress was unfriendly, acted as if I was bothering her, and asked if I wanted change back when I tendered $20 for a $15.50 bill.  Seriously?  Ridiculous..."}
{"text":"I don't get the reviews.  Food was awful.  Flaky calzones with a bunch of ingredients that don't mix well.  Good thing was that the food was inexpensive so I didn't feel bad.  Waiter made the night.  Waiter seemed as if it (don't want to get the person in trouble) was on a good trip and unknowingly provided good entertainment for all of us.    Yup, yup, did it once and done."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times that I can remember. I celebrate birthdays here because my favorite meal on the planet- meat and cheese pasty, red wine gravy, Strongbow pint- comes from this place. There aren't enough positive adjectives in the English language to express how much I love this place. The food quality is always consistently great. The atmosphere (in the original part of the restaurant) reminds me of being in London. It can get a little noisy in the newer part of the restaurant but the food more than makes up for it. I've sampled almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Dark as a tomb. No one at the door to seat you. No signs saying seat yourself. I never got a chance to even try the food. Oh well."}
{"text":"A good place to try,  especially if you haven't had a pasty.  Stopped here before a Dbacks game. Ate downstairs at a very nice bar/lounge area, nice dark lighting and intimate feel. Definitely check it out   Menu is pretty extensive, chose the Royale w/Cheese. You can choose any two dipping sauces off the menu which is nice too.  Overall, I thought the food was just ok. Maybe I picked the wrong thing. However, Lea my waitress/bartender was amazing. Seek her out, friendly and knowledgeable, fun chatting with.  I'll be back, wanted to try the lamb vindaloo. Lea recommended the salmon."}
{"text":"I love calzones, and this place is like every imaginable calzone option ever.  I don't like eating inside, as it's dark and cave like, but luckily they have a big, shaded patio which is perfect for lunch. Beers are good, love that they have size options. And $3 car bombs always and forever... Done.  The pastys are large and filling. One is usually two meals for me, which I love.  Definitely reccommend this place. Great tempe spot."}
{"text":"This was a great find. Had two pastys, which was hard to narrow down to. Also had the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake and the baked beans. Everything was great. Sat outside and watched the comings and goings of the street.   Had great service, great atmosphere, and great food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! All the food is homemade and so delicious it's hard to decide what to eat! The blue grass band on Sunday is terrific! The service is super fantastic and everyone is so friendly and nice! We will definitely eat here again when we come back to town!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for dinner the other day. She recommended that I try it. I was impressed! The food was delicious (I ordered the Shepherds Pie with Lamb)! The portions are huge.. I was able to save half of the pie for the next days lunch.   I hope I can go back there and try the other delicious pies they serve.   Tip: The Tempe location is a little hidden, but its worth it when you find it. I love how they have outdoor seating on pick-nick tables."}
{"text":"This has become my \"go to\" place in Tempe.  At this point I've had probably half of the items on the menu and have not been disappointed once.  They have Union Jack IPA on draft which, if you like IPA's, really can't be beat.  Brandon (I believe is the manager) is always friendly, attentive and helpful.  I hate to recommend this place because it's packed enough already - but hey, they deserve the business."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Company takes the idea of traditional miner food and gives it a modern face-lift. These glorified hot pockets (crispy, tender, flaky crust!) are filled with such nu-American classics as Pesto Chicken and mushrooms, steak and potatoes, and even the good ole' fashioned PB&J. Beer list is good and the wines and liquors are decent. This place gets pretty hoppin', but there isn't that long of a wait on busy nights. I love getting their roast potatoes on the side, and they are incredibly vegan/vegetarian friendly. However, no substitutions can be made as those are pre-made and frozen, which is part of why they only get 3 stars. The food is more of a 3.5, but their Tempe ASU clientele can be a little on the annoying/loud side, so I took off .5 stars for lack of atmosphere. This location is also quite small, but they do take-out and are open late."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Shuffleboard 2 pool tables and REAL PROPER DARTS!!  Hallelujah!!  And PG Tips tea."}
{"text":"After a little antiquing we stopped here as my wife was wanting to try it.  Atmosphere is pretty need and the seating surrounds the kitchen.  Service was just ok and the food was a bit slow but most likely as a result of everything being cooked to order.  Royale with cheese pasty was good and so was the Pilgrim which was Thanksgiving in a pastry.  Overall experience was okay, but maybe just not my favorite personal style of cuisine.  Check it out and make your own conclusions."}
{"text":"Had lunch plans for a buddy and I since he was going to be in the area for business and he'd never been to Cornish Pasty so we headed on over...  This is the first time that I've been to the Tempe version of this place... I've actually gone to the Mesa version quite a few times... and while this place is good it's not as good as the Mesa version.  Parking was a little rough as the lot was pretty full for lunch... I can't imagine this place on a Friday or Saturday night.  Pasty's in general are really good... and this time I got the Carne Adovada which was highly recommended by the server and some patrons next to us... it wasn't that great for me though for whatever reason.  The english pub vibe is great and the beer selection is awesome as well... I'd come back... but if I have a choice, I'd head to the Mesa location over the Tempe one."}
{"text":"Server didn't come by for 20 minutes. Asked one of the servers if she was our server. She was so rude we left and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars, because Cornish Pasty is a little better than 3 stars but doesn''t quite deserve 4. Service is very, very, VERY slow at lunchtime (which is the only time I've ever visited) so if you have a limited amount of time to get lunch, this isn't the right place to try. Meanwhile, the food is worth eating, and it's something different on the downtown menu. I've had 3 different pasties, and out of the 3, the Pilgrim that has turkey and stuffing in it is my favorite. The Oggie is good, but it has a LOT of black pepper in it, and I'm not a fan of pepper. The fries and pretty much everything else has had a lot of pepper, too, so if that's your thing, go for it.  If the side dishes were more reasonably portioned and priced, I probably would have tried more things. I'll probably be back because I work in the area and lunch offerings are slim, but I'd not make a special trip for it."}
{"text":"Moved back to Tempe and am now walking distance from the Cornish, so I've been in about once a week since June.  Sometimes for food, but some times just for ice cold beer and ice cold air in a great atmosphere.  The Lamb Vindaloo is even better than I remember, and discovered the Mexican.  The big new find was their Chicken Tikka Salad (check the pic).  Great if you're looking for something tasty but lighter than a pasty"}
{"text":"When we come to Tempe/Phoenix we are always excited to come check out Cornish Pasty. The place is usually dark & loud, which is definitely the atmosphere of this place (modeled to sorta feel like an old mine, without the coal dust). If you're looking for a brighter quieter place go to the library. Their pastys are freaking amazing. I think we've tried about 10 of them on the menu so far & our favorites are the Pilgrim & Roast dinner. The Pilgrim comes with a cranberry sauce that is super delicious with a red wine gravy style sauce that is also super delicious! The Roast Dinner comes with a creamy white sauce (still not sure what it is) and a red wine gravy sauce. We also like to get the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, if they have any available. If you like sweet super moist, rich, sorta carry desserts definitely try this. They some times serve it with ice cream, sometimes just cream, sometime both. The most recent time we were there we had both and it was so delicious (I think I like sticky toffee pudding with ice cream the best because it helps to cool it down & makes it even more sweet, but not sickly or overwhelmingly sweet). The only downside is the last two times we've come in they are out of hot tea. This time they were out of lemonade, but were able to 'find a tea bag in the back'. A British style restaurant out of tea? If this was London they would riot. This food is always delicious, atmosphere is unique, service can be a bit slow sometimes (that's because they're always busy in the evenings when we come), and bring a bag of tea just in case."}
{"text":"amazing (!) pasties outside of Michigan/U.P. - pleasantly surprised to discover Cornish Pasty Co. was worth the hype. Bangers/Mash & Lamb/Mint pasties were both delish.  would come here almost just for the fantastic beer list - local brews (Kilt Lifter, Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale), pale ales, stouts. Guinness already a steal at $4 normally, $3 during very happy hr. everyday 5-7.  restaurant is a cozy fit (not group-friendly) being long/narrow, with the bar running 2/3-length of the restaurant.  experienced oddly slow service, but servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company, I hate you!  You are only located in frickin Arizona, and I can't get my fix because I'm in San Francisco!   My husband and I ate a Pasty at practically every meal when I was in Arizona for a convention so we got to try a LOT of the flavors there.  Please please please consider opening a shop in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I'll get a little rounder, but hey - happy fat is alllllllll good."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very laid back, great food, and good variety of drinks! Every time I am around the area, I try to stop and eat there. It has never disappointed me and the cost of the food and drinks are adequate for what you get! Take my advice and swing by for the Italian pasty \"Calzone\", its deliciooooous!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! We are starting to love this little off strip and unlikely commercial shopping center with fantastic restaurants. Cornish Pasty is one of them. It's a pub with the best little sand which type things you can imagine. A \"past-y\" is a flaky pot pie crust like wrap around your choice of filling that is baked until golden. If hot pockets come to mind, think again. These are the bomb!   We started with the oven baked garlic \"chips\" which look like fries but taste so much better! Then both chose lamb based pasties, me the Shepard's Pie. I was surprised to see a full vegetarian list and vegan options too. Normally this would be my choice but a nostalgic pull for my trip to London ions ago had me try the Shepard's. It was really good! I could go on and on about the crust. Flaky, light and crunchy and slightly buttery. Can't remember a \"pie\" crust that good.   My other half who is not eating sandwiches much these days was really impressed as well. It's not our usual type of meal but when I saw this pop up on Yelp, I knew we had to stop in and give it a try. So glad we did.  Thanks Cornish Pasty for a great meal and experience!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what pasties were until I came here and they are so delicious. Great atmosphere and decor. Definitely a great place to unwind after a hard days of work, game or concert. I had the \"Royale\" and I wish I could've eaten it all but I was full with the first half. Go little on the appetizers and enjoy the pasty because I don't know where you can get these things. So it's your favorite meal baked into a pie that is so much better than a hot pocket. Our table had the chicken pot pie, the thanksgiving dinner, the Royale and the lamb. Everyone loved their pasty. We went in about 9:00 in the evening and it was still busy but we got a table quick. The bar has 2 pool tables, shuffle board and dart boards. So great hang out place for both locals and tourist."}
{"text":"Think hot pocket but way better. I tried the cottage pie pasty. It had ground beef, onions, mashed potatoes l, and a few other goodies. The pastry shell was very flavorful. Very interesting atmosphere. Very poorly light, tatted cooks, and 80's metal music blaring. Wanted to try the dessert but the pasty was very filling."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"leasing\" sign deter you from entering. This place is awesome!   There was one girl and one chef working this afternoon. She did a fantastic job at managing multiple tables. She was personable, nice and acknowledged everyone. The chef that brought out our pasty was also very happy and friendly.   I ordered the Mexican Pasty, Oven Chips with jalapeño and the Apple Caramel Pasty for two people.   Mexican Pasty - so freaking good. It all starts with a layer of seasoned, soft, melt in your mouth steak. Then comes the egg. It's scrambled, moist and cooked to perfection. There's delicately  sliced potatoes, chiles and then cheese melted throughout this work of art pasty.  Oven chips - also very delicious. Oven cooked and smothered in cracked black pepper and sea salt. I added jalapeños (there's an option for garlic too). The texture was perfect.   Apple Caramel Pasty - the crust on this one is something to remember. So flakey and sweet. It comes with ice cream too. There's a TON of caramel on this...there's caramel inside the pasty, on top of the pasty, on top of the ice cream and all around the plate. Next time I'll get it on the side. It's a perfect hot and cold balance though.   Portions are right, prices are fair, and the staff is friendly. There's a pasty on this menu for everyone! Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"I'm really not understanding the hype about this place. I've been here a few times and it's just nothing to sing about. The food is okay and definitely on the expensive side for what you get. But I've got friends who love it, so I must be missing something. lol"}
{"text":"Enough is already said. Classic place. I've been to every CP location, and I miss them greatly now that I live in CO. They also serve Franziskaner, a beer I've never found on tap anywhere else."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Company is an legit.  I went here with a bunch of friends and got a variety of pasty's.  They took a while to come to the table, but they were worth the wait.    The biggest attraction for us were the $3 Irish car bombs.  We came in around lunch time and this was the first thing we ordered to get our day rolling."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Company is fantastic. I've had many, many of their numerous options and my particular favorites have been the Lamb and Mint, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala (which was quite spicy!), the Lamb Vindaloo, and the Rosemary Chicken. The Peanut Butter and Jelly dessert pasty is pretty tasty, but it simply does not compare to the Sticky Toffee Pudding (best with the ice cream option). Sides are also really good - I really like the Oven Chips and the Broccoli and Cauliflower Bake."}
{"text":"Cornish is a great place to go if you are a meat and potatoes kinda person! This is like a hot pocket, but better! They have fresh ingredients, and they are made right on the spot for you. The downtown Phoenix location feels like walking into an old cathedral, with bench seats and everything! The staff was so nice to us as well. They even prepared meals and brought treats for the puppies that we had brought with us and were sitting out on the patio with."}
{"text":"We've never actually eaten at this place because we stop in to grab pasties to take home, when we drive down to Phoenix. The interior is like a dive bar with little to no lighting, not what you'd expect from a pasty place, and it looks closed from the outside. Don't let that put you off - the pasties are fantastic which is why it gets 5 starts from me! Extensive selection of vegetarian and even a few vegan choices, plus creative flavor combos. I've eaten many a Cornish pasty in my time, having frequented Cornwall quite a few times while growing up. These are really really good! The pastry is excellent and the fillings generous. My favorites are the Veggie \"Chicken' Tikka Masala, Veggie Asiago \"Chicken\", and Veggie Mexican. They even ship...hmm, tempting!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had some very nice earl grey tea, red wine and great food. Greek salad had an amazing homemade dressing, the chicken tikka pasty was very good but the bangers and mash was even better. Plan to go back and try the oggie next!"}
{"text":"This place has slow service for a restaurant bar at midnight when there is only two customers in the bar. Do you want a beverage too bad they won't ask till you've been there for 15 minutes. But don't worry they will tell you about how bad every place around them is and why while the exhibit the same behavior."}
{"text":"Cornish is my go to for a late night bite with friends.  There's something for everyone,  even the most picky eater.  plus their craft beer list is in point for yours truly.    Aside from the bomb - ass pasties,  their soups and salads are amazing.  My fave is the Chicken Tikka salad or the salmon Caesar.  The soups are too die for.  Tyne mushroom is sooo good and the tomato soup stands up to the best.    The ambiance is super cool,  but big enough to be inviting for everyone.  Free Pool and shuffle board are key.   Love this place,  and I'm so glad they're still going strong."}
{"text":"Cool place for a beer and some mouth chunks. Baked all ways with many flavors to offer. Their menu has lots to choose from, we ordered 7 different plates for only 4 people and we had a great time drinking and eating."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food - I had the meat and potatoes pasty and a side of curried fries - both were great.  Large variety of beers and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Had a giant beer and a pasty.  Pretty much a fancy hot pocket, but really good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great draft beer selection with local AZ brews available. We went during dinner and found seating on the first floor. Service was busy but still attentive. They gave us all separate checks without any issues. Prices are very reasonable... 20oz drafts for $7!"}
{"text":"This was different, we had a fail wait at a local spot and thought this was going to be a Mexican style empanada spot; FAIL!!  but that fail became a great lunch! Caught us off guard with the lighting inside but that changed real quick. Bartender was very cool and the meal was super dang good! We had the Carne Avadado, I think I spelled it wrong lol... will I be back? Yes! Meal was fresh, flavorful and hearty! Cheers"}
{"text":"Horrible service! The bartender was rude and acted like she owned the place! I WILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"This place was great. Its different. Great menu. Pretty good service considering the place was small and packed full of people.  Sitting at the bar the cook answered all our questions as the made our food. Food was great and the desert was even better."}
{"text":"Lets just say this place has no tolerance for people with food allergies. There is no removing items from their pasty's - so if you are allergic to something your choice will be limited.   Also if you have kids, there is no options for them. Will be the last time I dine here."}
{"text":"The peppered steak pasty is amazing and the peppercorn brandy sauce is so addictive. Also the carne adovada pasty is great. They have too many pasties to choose from which is just another reason to keep coming back.  For dessert, get the banoffee pie but save room because it is huge ( big enough for two people or more).  Also, if you like beer they have a lot of it and you can get steins if quantity is your thing."}
{"text":"The ridiculously long wait was totally worth it! My family and I visited the downtown location last night and you guys were on point! The building is absolutely beautiful, the ambience is perfect. Our waitress was attentive (but not suffocating) and very sweet. The food was just as amazing as always.   Thank you for making my son's birthday celebration memorable. We can't wait to visit again. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I wife and I live pretty close to Cornish pasty and we love it. Great beer, awesome food, and grungy environment. That is the total plus for us!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Delicious food, great drinks, terrific nightlife atmosphere! I would definitely recommend the ploughman's platter appetizer if you're out with some friends for drinks. We will certainly be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed. Good food, good beer selection, and while I agree we the the other reviewers that the service was a little slow, overall the product was very good. I'd definitely recommend eating here, and I will be back."}
{"text":"What the... I came to this page to send the URL to someone to show them how awesome CPC is, and Yelp was waving the Write Review button at me. I haven't done this already?  Weird. Maybe I just love CPC so much I thought the sheer force of my gastrointestinal passion for the place would write the review for me. Apparently not. But my love for this place abounds.  I'm not a veggietarian, but I do like a good veggie dish when available. CPC has a fantastic line of veggie pasties that many carnivores like just fine. Try the classic Oggie and Bangers & Mash, or my fave the Tikka Marsala.  They have several tasty beers on tap to keep any spicy choices under control, so cut loose!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many a times and I highly recommend.  I have never had a problem and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Fancy hot pockets with Rodenbach on draft? SOLD!  AND they have a full vegetarian & vegan menu. A lot places say they have a vegetarian menu. But that usually consists of a side salad and fries. These guys actually have a FULL menu. This is very important when your significant other is vegetarian. It's a good break from downtown and another awesome addition to what's always rad about commercial center."}
{"text":"Went here after First Friday and it was amazing! Loved it. This is my go to place to eat whenever I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Clearly was made fun of for being a trans individual.  I expected more out of people downtown.  Let down."}
{"text":"So I have to say...this place is not much from the outside, however the food, ambiance and service were great! Mushy peas are a must and all my group enjoyed everything they had. Curry potatoes were amazing, as was the lamb vindaloo pie. Thank you so much for a great evening! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place had such promise from the outside. Looks hip and has a nice space. We sat down and ordered from their decent veer list, which came quickly, but then for some reason it took about 50 minutes to get our meal. It didn't seem all that busy and food was visibly backed up on the kitchen line  The waitress was nice enough to give us a discount because of the delay, but waiting almost an hour for mediocre food was just not acceptable.  And then to boot, my friend got sick with diarrhea and vomit all night. We didn't eat or drink anywhere else, so I think it was from this place. Overall, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"On a two day business trip in Phoenix, the first meal I had was a Pasty here, The Oggie to be exact, and i just kept coming back.  For two days straight, all I ate were pasties. And though I felt as if I were in love at the beginning, the relationship seemed to spiral downhill in the end.   -Oggie, the original pasty, with meat, potatoes, and gravy... was excellent, and set the stage for my obsession.  -Italian was pretty decent as well, something like a more homemade type of pizza hot-pocket: with pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, and stewed tomatoes, then served with a side of marinara sauce.  -Lovely Bit Salmon was excellent!  Salmon, potatoes, asparagus... delicious! -Lamb Vindaloo, Lamb in red curry and potatoes... was decent, though I probably wouldn't get it again.   -Peppered Steak = GROSS, disgusting, worst thing I've ever received in any food making establishment.  I actually think mine was bad or rotten, and would've complained, but I'd taken it to go and so I was stuck with it.  I took one bite, gagged, spit it out, and threw it away.  If it weren't for the rotten peppered steak I received, I was going to give a 5-star review, but after it I think I'm being very forgiving with giving 4-stars.  Everything else was pretty excellent, so I'll try to forgive the one absolutely disgusting pasty."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the whole experience is impacted by the gross homeless Young man casually laying outside the door in a sleeping bag with a box of food on the ground that he was nibbling from As if he was in the comfort of his own living room. He was dirty disheveled stinky so it was gross walking by him walking into the restaurant as we left the restaurant he was still there gross and stinky. I don't know why the restaurant does not insist that he not sleep in front of their door during business hours. This was 6 PM in the evening. It Really adds  to the creep factor when you go in and out of the restaurant. The food is great but the ambience is ruined by the gross stinky person literally lounging/sleeping on the sidewalk in a sleeping bag at 6 pm eating from a carton of food off the ground Asking for money. Unfortunately this will be the demise of our downtown restaurants if they don't do something about it. If you like to visit Cornish pasty  Company I suggest a different location."}
{"text":"My favorite place!! Good food. Good drinks and good people. My husband loves the Mexican pasty. I always love the side dishes. There homemade baked bread is to die for. So yummy. I also love there regular oven chips, broccoli and cauliflower bake, mushy peas w/ a side of sour cream. There side salads with pesto dressing is delicious. I always save room for their Banoffee pie. It's the best dessert ever. They slice fresh banana on top. I was also told you can ask for fresh strawberries too. Defiantly going to try that next time. Do yourself a favor Vegas and go check this tasty place out. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Lord, I love this place.  I'm originally from the Tempe area where the first one was, and have been eating Pasties since 2005-2006. It's always been the place that my husband and I HAVE to go eat when we go to AZ to visit- so we were OVERJOYED that they decided to open up a place here!  Service is great, we always sit at the bar and chat with the bartender.  Also, they have hooks to hold your purse, which is a huge plus.  I love the pesto chicken, and have had multiple vegetarian pastys and they are so hearty, they definitely fill you up and you feel satisfied after your meal.  Also, they are fast- we were in a rush last time and made it in and out of there in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 10 stars!  Simply delicious and creative food, fantastic service. Had a 1/2 Greek salad and a pepper-steak pasty. Couldn't ask for anything better. Sat at the bar and all the guys were wikid cool, down to earth. Just go, you'll get it.  Food was so good, got another to go for dinner later."}
{"text":"First time there and seriously impressed. The server did not stop moving once. She was the bartender and server and the place was fairly busy. Great atmosphere and the food was delicious. I'm still full but already thinking about what I'll have the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"I'll give them a 2nd try, but probably not during lunch.  At first I was excited we got in before it was busy (only 2 other tables were occupied, and the 1 already had food), but we ended up waiting super long for our food- which was salads. It took over 30 min for them to arrive, and we had to remind our server we were still  waiting.   I'm pretty sure she simply forgot we were there. Not a single drink refill or check in until after we had to find her."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The food is outstanding. The beer list is decent. The space itself is awesome: church pews as seating!  I like to sit at the bar and watch them make the pasties. I like it so much, I usually buy one to eat and one to go home with me for the next day! Staff is friendly, even when they are slammed. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.  Love their food!  I have had a few of their Pasty's, loved each one.  Very friendly staff also.  I always reccomend to friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"It was my 1st time there. The food was AMAZING!!! The waitress was very knowledgeable and explained the menu very well. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The ultimate comfort food. Basically take all your favorite things and then wrap them in a pastry and bake it. OKAY. You can't ask for much more.   I've been dying to try this place when it opened in Phoenix, and then the food heavens opened and one popped up in Vegas.   Went here for a late night bite with my hubs. We grabbed a few appetizers and each ordered a pasty. For apps we got the fries and the cauliflower broccoli bake. Both were freaking fantastic. So delicious and decadent. I got The Pilgrim, which is basically thanksgiving dinner inside a pastry. I was in HEAVEN. The pastys are rather large. I could only eat half and my husband didn't finish his either. Perfect to take home or split!   Seriously give this place a try. Perfect for a cold, rainy day, or a late night bite. Or pretty much whenever you feel like eating a bunch of comfort food (so always)."}
{"text":"Really great comfort food!  I love the royale with cheese and the chicken pot pie.  They have a huge patio and make good drinks."}
{"text":"So being a native of Michigan and having spent time at Michigan Tech in the UP where every Friday night is Pasty Night, I  had to try the Cornish Pasty Co's Oggie pasty.  It was excellent.  I tried both the house gravy and ketchup (both traditional sauces) on it.  The Cornish style Cole slaw was excellent too.  I returned the next night and tried the Carne Adovada pasty.  A non-traditional pasty, but excellent in its own right.  I spent both nights at The Beast, a dive bar attached to the main dining room.  It was a pleasure to sit at the bat and enjoy the wide range of music - from Johnny Cash to the Butt hole Surfers and everything between."}
{"text":"My kids \"literally\" dragged me here. It seemed so far from where we live in Centennial Hills! Let me tell you... I will gladly travel any distance for the food and service here! Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"In my single days, this was my default first-date restaurant: laid-back and casual, cheap, and fast enough that a potentially disastrous first date wouldn't drag on for more than an hour. My fiancee (who, oddly enough, I did not bring here on our first date) and I still come here occasionally. I discovered it back in 2005, shortly after it opened, when a friend told me about it; it's gotten pretty well known now, but with its location, it's not the kind of place you'd just stumble upon.  I've tried many different pasties, and I keep coming back to the Oggie (the \"Original Pasty\") with the red wine gravy. Paired with a Hoegarden, it's the best meal for the money in Tempe."}
{"text":"So yummy! Friendly staff and a great menu that will have me going back for more! I love the flakiness of the dough and the different sauces that were in my pasty. I have was on my lunch break and couldn't have some beer but I definitely want to go back to try some after work and have a delicious pasty once again. My fav was the balsamic mushroom."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check Cornish out for a while now and I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere right off the bat-not overly pretentious, good balance of mood & energy in the place. Went in about 9 on a Friday night & sat at the bar. The staff at the bar were all friendly, not just the miss that was serving us. I had the sloe gin cherry fizz, which was very refreshing & perfectly sweet. Fiancé & I shared the cottage pie & Cajun chicken pasties. Both were delicious! The gravy was intense, a little goes a long way. Can't wait to come back here & make it more of a habit."}
{"text":"I'm very interested in Celtic culture, so this place piqued my interest. How authentic is it, you may ask? I couldn't tell you because I've never been to Cornwall, but the pasties are good! If you've never had a pasty before, think empanadas, but with gravy, potatoes, lamb and peas and carrots inside.  They also have non-traditional pasties as well, with stuffings to make them resemble calzones and other foods.   I also really like the feel of the place, and how they've re-purposed several random items for decorations.   I'd really like to go back for drinks, as I feel like this would be a very laid-back, chill drinking atmosphere. And hipster heaven.  ...sometimes I wonder if I'm secretly a hipster, but then I think, what hipsters spend time wondering what kind of societal label they fit into? I think not. =)   Anywho - come here and try a pasty!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! As a person who is obsessed with handheld meat pies, I'm always looks for poroshkies, pasties, pot pies, etc.   The variety is splendid; I can go here with both my meat-eating hubby and my vegan sister. I can't wait to try each one!"}
{"text":"This place is, hands down, amazing!  The pasties are delicious and made with the tastiest ingredients. The sides are excellent and the desserts are some of the best I've ever had.    I live in Los Angeles and have to come here every time I'm in Vegas. I've never ordered anything I didn't like but some of my favorites are the bangers and mash, spicy Asiago chicken, and the Mexican. I always make sure to get some to bake at home.   I encourage everyone to try this place while in Vegas. You will definitely be satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The Patsy's are delicious; the ingredients are always so fresh and I haven't had a pasty that I didn't like.  There's a relaxed and comfortable vibe wether you sit at the bar or one of the tables with the church benches; and this place also has the BEST dessert! The sticky toffee pudding and a pot of P.G. Tips is a perfect way to end your experience."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. It was something I had never tried before. I had the salmon one which could have been a little  more flavorful but the one my husband had was quite tasty. We probably will be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled into Cornish while waiting for friend at airport. Garrett our server A+ I could not decide on beer and he effortlessly offered samples of drafts...love it!  The pasties ... My boyfriend of course Italiano ... Yes Me going with comfort ... Oggie with chicken gravy... Ahh In a strip mall but hey we are in Phoenix !"}
{"text":"You MUST eat here if you are looking for something different, YUMMY, and fun.  So many pasty choices - can't wait to try more!  Love the vegetarian options that were available for my companion.  The curry potatoes are out of this world!  Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"It rules, I love the Hoegaarden as well as the the salmon, and Lamb Vindaloo pasties.  This is probably my favorite restaurant in Tempe.  There is one really good pasty but I'm keeping it a secret."}
{"text":"It's a across the street from my house but I've only been there once, because the food is strange. Everything was prepared great. I had an Indian pasty, my fiance had a Jamaican pasty (I think). We also had the tandoori wings which I didn't like but my fiance absolutely loved them, and of course a few beers. They have beer from all around the world which is cool and the staff and ambiance is pretty down to earth and chill. I just haven't been more than once because it's not food I would eat on a regular basis at all but it is good!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place with my BF and we LOVE it!!! The soup is beyond amazing, great beer on tap and a super cool atmosphere.  Food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Shepherds pie was great. It was really dark inside. I guess that's an Arizona thing with the heat and electricity and such."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Went with my family. We had Greek salad, original pasty and chicken pot pie pasty, and chips.  The salad was super fresh and crisp.  The pasty crust was flaky and the fillings were well spiced.  We also had STP and apple pasty for dessert.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a local and decided to try it out due to the reviews here and on Trip Advisor.  The place is dark and feels cramped, for all that it is not at all a small place.  It is also very, very difficult to find.  The entrance is actually on the opposite part of the building from the street it is \"on.\"  The place is more college bar than British pub as far as atmosphere.  The staff are indistinguishable from the customers but once discovered, generally helpful.  I had the Royale with Cheese and it was very good.  The pastry was crispy and tasty, the filling was well balanced and seasoned.  I'm not sure I would recommend it as a place for dinner or just to grab a meal, but it is absolutely a place I would go to hang out with  friends over drinks and food.    I would definitely come back on another trip into town, but maybe call in and order take away.  I'm not sure I could deal with that atmosphere at the end of a long day of travel again when all I want is to relax and enjoy a little peace."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my whole family and everyone was very satisfied with what they ordered.  I ordered the Tikka Masala pasty, husband ordered the Cajun and all three kids (12-17 yo) ordered the Italian.  Layout and design was cool and staff all friendly and attentive. Loved the church pew seating!"}
{"text":"After hearing allot about this place from several close friends and being ambushed on social media by people I know that all said this place was \"amazing\" and \"the greatest place they have ever eatin\" I was nervous to try it. You see, most if my friends are complete morons. Why else would we be be friends? With that said... Me and the old lady decide to check this place out for our selves yesterday after she got done work early... We arrived to see plenty of parking.. We walked in and it was well lit, decorated well and clean.. We were off to a great start. We sat down and were greeted promptly and friendly by everyone behind the bar.. Fun music playing, relaxing and causal. They had a good sized selection of Kraft beers so I asked some questions and I got the rogue hazelnut beer and my wife got a strongbow.. The menu had a lot of veggie and vegan things to choose from, which is great since we are vegetarians. We started with the oven baked fries were great! Not greasy, seasoned perfectly and not dry. Then the baked broccoli And cauliflower something, it was crunchy, creamy and tasty. Then we got the potato, leak and Stilton soup, this blew my fucking mind! Creamy and smooth but not heavey, potatoes were perfect, great taste, perfect temp, great color and the sour dough bread on the side complemented it and help make it one of the best soups I have ever had! No bullshit... By this time I was ready for another beer, I tried a couple but had to get the iron maiden beer, cause, well it's iron fucking maidan. It's was actually really good and not just a pretty bottle.Then we got I believe it was called veggie cottage pie? We split it and I'm glade we did. It was pretty big.. I'm not to familiar with this type of food but I loved it! Seasoned expertly, great mouth feel and very filling... It was truly a great meal... All the guys were great! Genuinely friendly and helpful when ordering. The only ones name i can remember is hank, cause it's hank and he's rad... But all of them were a good time to talk to and added to the dinning experience.. When we got the check I was surprised on how low the price was.. I then looked at the menu again and looked at the prices. This place prices it's food to move man... It was less then if we went to sushi and we were full and caught a nice buzz! We will be going here on the regular and recommending it to everyone who will listen! Turns out my friends aren't complete morons after all... Go figure"}
{"text":"Vegetarian and Vegan pasties!!! What more do I have to say!! They are flaky and they have a ton of choices. You really cant go wrong with this one"}
{"text":"Just a quick update. I've been many times since and these pasties are incredible."}
{"text":"A super cool scene with a great beer selection, good service, and most importantly delicious food.  We went on a slow night super late and there were only a few people eating.  I would describe the decor as hipster industrial, but definitely not sloppy.  The place was really cool and well put together.    The beer was primo, tried a few of the darker selections and was very happy with the taste and the knowledge of the server.    The Pasties:  I gotta be honest, I'm not a gigantic pasty fan, but I gotta say that these little buggers were tasty.  Nothing mind-blowing, but very good.  My friends think otherwise, they are big big fans.  Given that the pasties are around 4-stars to me and the decor, service, beer selection, and the fun atmosphere (including pool table) are 5-star, this place gets an overall 5-stars from me."}
{"text":"So I've had this place bookmarked on yelp for over a year and I finally made it!!!! Woot!!! :)  It was totally worth the drive!!! I live on the west side of town and very rarely want to drive to the east side.  I'm sorry I hate dealing with traffic.  Lol. :)  Any hoo....  I will most definitely be driving back here.  Yes I will put up with the drive to get more pasties!!!! Omg! They were delicious!  :)  I started out with a beer...it was a weird night....they seemed to be out of alot of beers tonight but the one the waitress recommended was delicious. Bockor Vanderghinste Oud Bruin was delicious.  :)  The table got an order of the oven chips with garlic and jalapeños.  They were the mildest jalapeños I've ever had.  No spice whatsoever. But the garlic flavor was dead on.  They were a tad on the soft side but still good. In other words unless u want dragon breathe don't order these.  Lol (4.5/5)  I got the bangers and mash. The pastry wrapping everything was flaky and tender but still firm enough to hold everything in place.  The mash potatoes were heavenly! :) the bangers were so flavorful. You could taste all the herbs like rosemary but everything was very well balanced.  (5/5)  I had a bite of someone's oggie and it was good but after eating mine it tasted almost one note. I also had a bite of someone's chicken Alfredo and it was good as well but so far out of the three that I tasted....bangers and mash was #1 in my book.  :)  I honestly thought that the pasties would be made ahead of time and just baked to order. NOPE. that is not the case. They make each and every single one to order......FRESH. And it shows.    I would recommend this place to anyone.  And it's an open bar/kitchen so u can see the guy making your pasty. :)"}
{"text":"I was feeling like reliving my Irish days on St. Patty's Day but had no desire to do so with the drunken American idiots that frequent bars for artificial food coloring added to their watered down brew. Strictly speaking Cornwall is far far away from Dublin, but it was close close to where I was working on St. Patty's this year, and I knew I wouldn't likely run into green beer.   Bingo. I have often done delivery of CPC 'samazing grub, but shockingly have never been inside. I was impressed. Mid day darkness isn't my usual m.o. but I was diggin it. Narrow and cozy, it truly was like going back to Ireland. It was the closest thing to a pub I have seen in AZ.  I ordered my Manger's Cider at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the kitchen staff: friendly young guys who were enjoying life. I am a fan of enjoying life while you are working, and I am always sure to have a good meal when the staff is doing so. Got a chicken pot pie pasty, chips with malt vinegar. Good stick to your ribs lunch fare. Red wine gravy was two thumbs up caliber.  Expensive, came to 21 bucks with tip, more than my usual lunch budget allows, but ok for a splurge.   I feel I did my Irish duty and definitely think this lunch counts for more than a green tie.  out."}
{"text":"I am British (and have eaten many Cornish pasties) and have to say this place is excellent! Even though they were out of mushy peas and HP, the quality of the pasties were outstanding. I will be back to satisfy my craving for home cooked food! British cooking at it's best. Try it!"}
{"text":"Sadly not a fan. As a first timer I asked for a recommendation and was steered to the Roast Pasty. They have redefined bland. Is it possible to inject tasteless? I was shocked. Sadly I say because I am on a constant hunt for good food."}
{"text":"I went for ap astry but all there was was drunk rich college kids!!! DADDY bought those drinks!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE \"The Pasty\", as my bff and I call it!  Met my boyfriend there at the bar!  love the leek and potato soup with the bread and butter!  LOVE! and the service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"So, I've only lived in Tempe for about two months, but I've come here a lot!  This place never disappoints!  The Chicken Pot Pie Pasty, Garlic Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the Caramel Apple Pasty A la Mode are my go to fantasy dinner!  Our favorite server, Tim, creates the ultimate dining experience for us each and every time!  I bring everyone I know here to entertain and will continue to do so!  Great Work Cornish!!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest! The wife and I come here rather frequently and everything we have had is delicious! Large selection of beer and pasties. My only complaint is they are always out of salmon. Lol. I highly recommend chicken tikka masala. The service is great the food is hot and the beer is cold, can you ask for more!! Next time you're in the area stop in, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very nice. I had the one with lamb and mint. I was worried about the mint but I did not need to. It was delish. Nice place and great to gather with friends. In general, it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Food awesome, atmosphere awesome, service SUCKS....we had some baled guy who looked like he rather be at a funeral...horrible...no personality...too bad...they should fire him....if you don't want to work...let someone work who does...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Walking in you get a retro bar feel. They play all the \"oldies, but goodies\" music and the peeps were primarily semi-hipsters (AZ style). I'm a fan of tattoos and this style, even though I don't appear to be, so I was digging it. One side is a bar scene with pool and other games (briefly walked through); the other side was the restaurant. They have booths, tables and 'breakfast nooks'; host told us to sit wherever.   Service: A few different people approached us throughout our dining experience and all were nice. Two were very attentive, but one first forgot the lemon for our waters and didn't ask if I wanted more water each time she approached (so I asked since my cup was empty and sitting at the edge of the table - I thought this was the unspoken universal signal for 'please refill me' but perhaps she's new to serving lol).   Menu: Very clear and not busy. I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it).   Food: Came out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho).   Restroom:  Not very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth.   Overall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers."}
{"text":"What a great find. I was with my friend over the Christmas holiday and we decided to check this place out. Upon entering this BAR/restaurant I was immediately turned off by the blasting of music so loud my heart was pounding. After ordering and waiting on our drinks I had decided to just leave because of the music but was presently surprised that after asking the waitresses to turn the music down, she did with a smile. I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie. Let me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same. There prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50. I am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage. If you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside. I should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating."}
{"text":"Before coming here I had no idea what a pasty was. After going I cannot stop talking about them! The food is amazing and the service was just as great! Thank you Felipe for taking such good care of us on opening night.   First off, what in the world is a pasty? For someone as ignorant as myself in the foodie world it is a FANCY A$$ HOT POCKET. I know. You are having thoughts of how disgusting a food hot pockets are. They are. However, a pasty is so much more. First and foremost it is super filling. I really could have just eaten half and taken the rest home for lunch the next day, but I literally COULD NOT STOP EATING IT! I tried to stop. Then my craving got worse. I started taking parts of pasties from the other guests at my table. Second, it is filled with quality ingredients. Whether it be peppered steak bits of chicken and artichokes, these fillings are amazingly put together and perfectly seasoned. Third, NO MICROWAVES! They are baked goodness that comes from the heavens.   What did I have to make me crumble at the knees like this? Well my little heart broke opening night since I wanted to try the Oggie (the traditional pasty) which includes steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) With a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. We did come pretty late so I had to make a decision fast. I opted for the Pesto Chicken. Marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, artichokes, fresh mozzarella and pesto with a side of marinara came to the table. All of this wrapped up neatly in a flaky outer crust. I don't even know how to begin because it was all a blur after that. I devoured this thing. There was very little talking at our table as we were all busy consuming our pasties as well as protecting them from each other.   For dessert we all (four of us) shared a Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. It was plenty enough after our dinner. It is a square of homemade bread baked in chocolate brandy sauce. We had it with a side of ice cream The crunchy outside perfectly complimented the hot and soft center.   All in all it was a total success. The prices are amazing for the quality and love that goes into preparing the food. I simply cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you love delicious things that taste like sunshine and miracles. Stay out of my world."}
{"text":"The place was dark and hard to find - the sign must be out, or maybe they don't need it.  There wasn't a seat left in the tiny hallway of a restraunt, so we made our way all the way to the back and sat ourselves down at a massive table.    Service was good.  Food is a nice change from standard US fare.  These are deluxe hot pockets which may look small, but pack a pretty filling meal.  Hoegarden on tap too, way to go."}
{"text":"A friend who lives in Vegas recommended this place to us.  We enjoyed the Paneer Pasty!  And the Sticky Toffee Pudding is as good as everyone else mentions in the reviews!  It's got a dive-y vibe, and was easy to get to given we were on the north end of the strip.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is a pretty amazing place.  I don't like how the building is kind of a shotgun, which is a bit picky but whatever, the food is great.  I'm vegetarian and they have fake chicken and a whole vegetarian menu that has the same amazing dishes that they have for meat eaters.  And by dishes I mean pasties.    Ok, so while the Pasties are basically hot pockets, they are really quite a full meal.  I've been more than once, and each time the food and service (people have talked about lax service, which I haven't ever seen) have been amazing.  It's super delicious and it feels neat to be eating something so historic."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to eat.  If you dont like crowded places, try their restaurant at Dobson and Guadalupe...more space same great selection.  Here's another suggestion:  Throw a Pasty Party.   They do catering as well.  We had a great party with two of each flavor of pasties. Great fun!"}
{"text":"Good food good drinks , a pretty hipster place.  They have a nice picture of Aly on their wall which is nice."}
{"text":"As a native U.P. girl, the pasty is something you either get right or you don't. I cannot vouch for the quality of anything on the menu except the Oggie. No idea why the heck it's called an Oggie... it's a traditional pasty (the only way a pasty should be made). And it's a good one at that. As a kid, pasties were my requested birthday dinner but no one wanted to bake pasties in July. This year... I had my birthday pasty! My only complaint? A tiny dish of ketchup is not nearly enough. Leave a fresh bottle on the table and don't judge. ;) We ate every bite and got par-baked to go for dinner with the kids tomorrow. Yum!"}
{"text":"TOP restaurant I have ever been to in Arizona or even on the west coast.. Once you start walking into the pub you feel like you have suddenly traveled over the pond and back to America's roots BRITISH FOOD! I have always heard horrible  things about how British food consisted of mainly fish and chips and other bland entree's - to my pleasant surprise  the Food was Delicious! - huge beers  -Pasty for all food types  - the service is outstanding  Give yourself the gift of time travel and head on over  to Cornish Pasty Company  where you can leave the southwest once you step in the dark hall of the restaurant EXPERIENCE LIFE ABROAD!"}
{"text":"Five friggin' stars for the food - this Asian gal is loving me some pasties!  Okay, but the two stars are for the less than stellar service during a weekday lunch that included seven of us co-workers.  Two pasty orders were mistakenly not submitted to the kitchen and so, five of us wolfed down ours; while the other guys waited.  Granted, the restaurant offered something in the meantime - perhaps a salad or soup, which they accepted.  But it wasn't until we were leaving when their pasties were ready.  Just the general bringing us the check, and containers for leftovers took so long!  Thank goodness our boss was with us.  Perhaps, the restaurant is not concerned with drawing in the work crowd.  Most of us have to be in and out within an hour."}
{"text":"Holy shit is this place awesome. Great unique foods, which are essentially hand held pot pies, wonderful beer selection, and desserts that will knock your socks off. This is truly a unique gem. One thing that shines brightest is the warm, friendly service. It'd be easy to look at the staff and assume you'll be getting shat upon by a hipster tattooed crew, but in reality- they really care about service, and have pride in what they do.  Pro Tip- have the banana dessert, it is insanely good."}
{"text":"Great food, very atmospheric. Loved it! Definitely recommend to anyone who loves meat pies."}
{"text":"Had the PB&J w/warm banana pasty.  Five stars for the food, one star for the service = 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"Went back this afternoon to enjoy happy hour with my coworkers. We had a great time and I enjoyed more of the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale. The waitress was very nice, offered to provide us with separate checks and even took our picture for us.  I loved the music, nothing better then Led Zepplin, Buffalo Springfield, and all the other great 70's tunes they were playing.  The best part is getting dinner to go and enjoying pasties at home."}
{"text":"Everything was great!  The food, the service, the atmosphere.  We had a great late dinner here and can't wait to come back (not so close to closing time).  Great selection of beers and food was delicious!  Really recommend the Reuben!  They make their sauerkraut homemade, in house.  So delicious :-)."}
{"text":"Yeah so I ended up in Phoenix one day and got off the plane and said yo what up son.  My cousin said we would go get some Pasty's.  Uhh the hell do I want to cover up my nipples for I asked.  But noooo, these are like other reviewers have said, fancy hot pockets or giant dumpling...! I feel like everything at night in AZ is dark cause your windows are blacked out.  It gives a strange sensation at night...maybe it's just me.  But this place was pretty dark outside.   Greeted immediately upon entering...always a great first impression.  The interior was dark but decently lit.  Seating was primarily either the bar or long communal tables w/ benches. They play some cool metal/alt music that must be local or unsigned cause shazam wouldn't even pick that up. I went straight for the \"Premium\" section and got a Tandoori Chicken Pasty.  So the pasty itself is cut in half but it's a little difficult to eat like a hot pocket since it does fall apart, so you're better off with utensils.  But I'm a savage so I eat with my hands...take that pasty. Don't forget the fries!  Garlic!  With Jalapenos!  Fresh cut, some skin, and nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"neh.  nothing special 2 me.  they have a good beer selection and many different pasties.  that's about it.  not so awesome service, and i was told that the waitress was their regular waitress, hilarious.    if u like stuff wrapped in pie dough and baked, go 4 it.  this stuff is too dry 4 me, but i do know sum people who like comin here 2 drink their huge cups of beer and eat pasties (that prob only taste decent cuz they're gettin tipsy)."}
{"text":"Loved this place. At first glance the bldg looks deserted but I gladly followed some people into a black sheet covered door into the land of Pasty.   They have so many Pasty's  to choose from people will find that the issue is never not finding anything they like but which one to try first.   I had the Chicken feta. Stuffed with chicken and perfectly crisp. Can't wait to go back and try another one."}
{"text":"Well... its 2:15 and only 5 patrons are eating.  Ive been standing and waiting to be seated for 10 mins directly in front of the kitchen.  Kitchen staff have looked at me and said nothing.  A waitress eyeballed me and said nothing. I've been completely ignored while standing DIRECTLY in front of a sign that says \"please wait to be seated\"  I guess that's all I'll be doing here today..... waiting.....  UPDATE:  After waiting, I flagged down a waitress, my friend (a local) and I sat down and ordered.  I was visiting Las Vegas for the Las Vegas Furniture Market and had stopped in to catch a quick lunch before flying back home.  Our food took 20mins, which is totally normal in the grand scheme of things but it came out wrong as I don't eat meat.  This was told to our waitress when we ordered.  Our waitress stated that she would remake it and it would only take 20 more mins. (mind you I've already spent 50 mins at this establishment).  Her co-worker apologized on her behalf and said she'd be happy to comp that part of our meal.  After 15 more mins, I received my correct order and had to eat it quickly as to not miss my flight. We were ready to pay and waited another 10 mins. Our waitress never showed. We got up to walk to someone who could help us and she RAN over to us, printed our receipt and the check was incorrect. When we alerted her to this, she stated that the wrong order was taken off and the right one was put on instead.  When we corrected her she got extremely flustered with us.   We still tipped her but I definitely will never eat here again or sent co-workers from conventions."}
{"text":"I had a Bangers & Mash Pasty the other night. I've never had one of any kind before this. It was one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was just as good the next day too. I never eat left over at all! Must try!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great little gem this place proved to be!  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided I had to give this place a try myself.  I admit, I was skeptical, I'm not a huge 'bread' or 'carb' fan, and I really don't like thick bread coated anything.  The pasties I've had in the past were similar to calzones in breadiness.  The pasties here, were something amazing and not at all what I've had in the past or imagined.  There menu was quite complete with heavier choices such as the meat and cheese to lighter chicken options and even some dessert pasties.  I opted for a chicken tikka masala pasty.  I was impressed by the presentation, a simple metal plate with the well portioned pasty cut in half and a side of tsaziki sauce.  The pasty crust was thin and delicate.  It was reminiscent of a hand worked Christmas pie dough that your Grandmother slaved over.  It wasn't too flaky or thick, and was the perfect match for the tasty filling.  The filling was delicious chunks of white meat chicken, little nibbles of potatoes and some peas in a deliciously balanced flavorful masala sauce.  The taste was quite authentic and the spice right on par with what I'd expect from an Indian food restaurant.  The tsaziki side sauce was cool and tangy, it was a good flavor contrast to the spicy meat pocket.  Since the  portion was rather large, I had more than half of my pasty left and took it to go.  I couldn't resist trying the PB&J pasty though.  I had one warmed and packaged to go.  I am SO glad I got the PB&J pasty as well.  It was so incredibly delicious!  Served with a side of fresh whipped cream, the PB&J was like an old childhood friend.  The warm crunchy peanut butter with the perfect banana slice and sweet strawberry jelly melted harmoniously in my mouth and still gave that satisfying 'coat your mouth' feeling that peanut butter does.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Oh. 97 reviews. Guess it's not a secret. Well, I'm sure they all read about the same. I've eaten there 3 times, and that's about 8 not enough. If you want something different, this is it. Oggie is good, the Cajun was great. I wanna try many others."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, that was recommended to us by a local barber.  The plaza here has many other restaurants and businesses as well, but the whole area looks so empty and deserted and it smells really bad. But don't let that scare you away from trying this place!  We arrived around noon, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant.  We were the first ones there and a few others came afterwards.  They have a large bar in the middle with bar seating, and lots of tables around it. Great for small and large parties.  We were allowed to sit wherever we wanted which is cool.  They actually have a large variety to choose from on their menu. Mostly consisting of their popular pasties, which is a pastry with different types of fillings.  I wanted to Peppered Steak pasty but surprisingly they didn't have it or ran out of it, which is weird because this place isn't even busy.  So I got the Cheesesteak Pasty instead. I was very undecided on which sauce I wanted, so the server was nice to give me two options instead of one to try.  I can honestly say that their pasties are DELICIOUS. Tastes fresh out of the oven with very generous portions of meat and veggies. And very cheesy and gooey and yummy. They are a good portioned size as well. You could get full off of one of these without any extra appetizers.  Their pasties range anywhere between $11-$15 each.  You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I cant even describe how good this was. I had the roast beef sarnie. Roast beef onions portobello in a gravy served with horseradish cream sauce. The pastry was perfect and the filling very tasty. We shared the chocolate bread pudding w/ice cream. Ive never had bread pudding. If it is all that good then yum! It was roch and moist. The choc brandy sauce was mase with dark chocolate. My only complaint was the music gave me a headache. I grew up with metal but dont like it while eating. I will return though."}
{"text":"Amazing! You can watch the chefs prepare your pasty fresh in front of you! We sat at the bar just for hat experience! There are so many choices of pasties compared to what I am used to ordering frozen and heating up back in MI! We went on Valentine's Day and they were out of some ingredients (understandable as it is probably one of the busiest days of the year), but the waitress took great care of us and our food was done in a reasonable amount of time! I will be back for sure and definitely bringing my friends from home! I want to try them all! My boyfriend was really excited about the breakfast pasty and loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is great service is TERRIBLE!!! This is my third visit to the Cornish Pasty. I love the food but each time I get so frustrated with the wait staff. It's like they are slow on purpose. I keep coming back thinking \"this time it will be different\", but it never is."}
{"text":"Best food in town. If you're all about being a part of 'the scene' - this is the place for you. They seem to only hire aspiring models and bearded biker types, but I heard this is cool now-a-days. Food can be pricey and heavily buttered, but it tastes great and is made right in front of you so you can see no one is messing with your food in the back. Go to the Mesa location to avoid 'sceney' type people. They keep the place dimly lit and there is a smokers patio. Don't be surprised if someone there offers you drugs. This is a notorious spot for cocaine transactions, hence the 'sceney' aspect. I don't judge, but if this business started drug testing it's employees, it would not have a staff, so don't fix what's not broken. Keep on truckin'"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious meat filled pockets of heaven.  Don't let the location scare you from visiting here, it's more than worth it.   Ordered the royal which is basically a bacon cheeseburger in a pasty.  So perfectly balanced and fantastic.  Husband got the eggplant parmesan, equally delicious.   Mushy peas were perfect.   They also have a ton of beers and some hard cider choices.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pasty are tasty.  Scotch eggs are awesome.  Beer, darts, and pool tables made it a good hangout for us."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try out Cornish Pasty Co. for awhile as we have heard such good things about it from friends and food blogs.  We finally got our chance last night.  It's located in the Las Vegas downtown art's district which is undergoing gentrification with some new businesses (such as this) and fun activities like first friday. At times this area can be sketchy and parking can be difficult.    When we drove up there was a small lot next to the restaurant with a parking attendant who directed us to park in one of the 5 spots and with a flash light was directing traffic and helping others back out. We had a feeling he wasn't truly employed by the building, but my husband being impressed with both his innovation in creating his own job and eagerness to help, tipped him a few bucks.  Once inside we learned the Cornish Pasty Co. staff know him by name, have a fondness for him, and informed us he lives in a van close by.  So, if you see the parking attendant when you visit, don't be alarmed... He is actually very kind.  Though Cornish Pasty Co. is a franchise, it did have a true downtown Vegas feel with church benches, gothic urban decor, and a very large bar area.  We came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was loud from people in the bar area, so instead of sitting at one of the tables we decided to join them and sat ourselves there too. For light, they had really tall tapered candles that were lit and placed into wine bottles with wax spilling down onto the bar which was really cool looking. The bar was large and wrapped around the whole back of the restaurant and could have accommodated 30 at least.   We learned pasties are an English traditional pastry the miners in the 1900's would eat for lunch on the job. The menu describes some interesting history about pasties like how the miner's wives would bake them sweet on one side and savory on the other, label one side, making it possible for the miners to have their dessert built into their lunch.  With this history, Cornish Pasty Co. decorated the walls with old, black and white mining photos.  The menu is massive with tons of pasty options and I was impressed as they had 12 that were vegetarian and another 3 that were vegan (vegan options change daily). I was surprised to see so many Indian dishes and was weird to me at first, but Indian food is now one of the most popular cuisines in the UK, so I guess it makes sense.  I ordered the Veggie Rosemary Chicken Pasty which comes with veggie chicken, roasted red potatoes, brie, roasted red peppers and fresh rosemary which is served with a mustard cream sauce.  My husband had the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) with Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga with a side of red wine gravy. We ordered a few sides--Broccoli & Cauliflower Cheese Bake and the Homemade Coleslaw. The sides were really pretty good and at $4.75 and $2.50 we were impressed with how affordable they were. The portion size of the Pastys are actually very large.  Ordering two pasties and two sides was more food than the both of us could handle.    Overall we liked what we ordered and will return to try some of their Indian inspired options.  You can order a number of their pasties par cooked from the restaurant and finish it at home.  Good idea if you want to impress house guests at a dinner party or date night dinner at home.  On their website you are also able to have these shipped to your home."}
{"text":"Wow-this place is incredible and the best British food I've ever eaten. Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't post a review just after I ate here.  Bottom line: nice little pub with a good selection of brews (including ciders) on tap, and great food.  Never had a pasty before.  What I got was a tasty British-style sandwich in a flaky puff pastry, with a side of equally yummy red-wine gravy for dipping.  Fries ('chips') were also nicely done.  Service was prompt, friendly, and diligent without being overly chummy - you get the feeling this is a place run by a crew of friends.  It's a dark, quiet bar with no TV, no loud music, and minimalist decor - in short, a good place to go when you want to get away from it all and wind down in peace.  Looking forward to my next visit and trying a different flavor of pasty."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! However, I must admit that the location is pretty eerie past 8 pm because there's surrounding clubs and weird swinger bars...but that is besides the point!  The food and service is great! I recently found this gem and was surprised at how cool the vibe is! The inside has a neat rectangular bar that is dead center of the room and there's surrounding tables that are cozy so you can have an intimate meal with someone! They play loads of great songs from Frank Sinatra to The Ramones and even Bobby Darin. The coolest part is that they offer Vegan and Vegetarian options! I chose the royale with cheese and the second time I went I chose the chicken pot pie! Both times I wasn't let down by the amazing quality of food! Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the veggie Mexican for first time.  I think I may be in love. The salsa is one of the best I've had in a long long time (im talking back home in texas). I'm glad this joint doesn't play rap music. You'll hear some punk and post punk instead. Wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! The food is great, the environment is great. Cornish is always my first or last stop before a night out."}
{"text":"This is one place that totally lived up to the hype. The roasted garlic rosemary potatoes as a side dish were outstanding - very crunchy and well seasoned with of course Rosemary. Our pasties were equally impressive. The greek was my choice with big chunks of chicken, two kinds of cheese and veggies that included kalamata olives and artichokes. Every bite you got something new and it didn't even need both sauces, but the Tzitiki was excellent for dipping. dad had the Pilgrim (no turkey anymore), but had some nice roasted chicken and sweet poatoes and onions also. Thev wait staff was friendly as hell, great service and this place is bigger than it looks also on the inside. Good times."}
{"text":"SIMPLY AMAZING! The Oggy Pasty is delicious.  Butte Montana makes the best pasties but I will say the Oggy Pasty is very close. Very friendly relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from someone at work. The location isn't the easiest to find, but it's worth it. We decided to order out to take home. The waitress went over the menu with us and helped us to make selections, and gave us water while we waited for our order. The pasties were incredible - and we have eaten pasties in Cornwall. These compare very favorably. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company is the best! If your looking for amazing comfort food all wrapped in a flaky crust this is the place! I haven't had one that I didn't like. My all time favorite is the Bangers & Mash! Its like your moms home cooking of meatloaf and mashed potatoes with extra gravy. The service at this location is great, they are very friendly and outgoing. I've even eaten here alone and felt totally comfortable eating at the bar. They also have a great selection of beer. If you haven't tried this place out you need to go . . . like right now!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great location. Whether you're looking for a simple bite to eat or a drink on a date night, this place has a great atmosphere for any occasion."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with a little history... I'm married to a chap from England.  I've been to England. And I eat. A lot. Not too memorable, if you get my drift.  Had I not seen a soon-to-be-opened Scottsdale location, I never would've tried this place. You know, British food and all (keep in mind my British husband who loves these things called mushy peas,  \"Bubble and Squeak\" and some sort of kidney pie). Ewwww...nuff said.  Well, out of curiosity, I looked up the menu, and off we were to the Tempe location.   It's VERY dark in here, and I imagine that on some cold, winter day, I'd like to spend a few hours in here drinking beer, listening to the awesome music they play and fiddling around with some of the menu items I haven't tried. And I know that when it's hot here, we all like to hide from the sun a little. But seriously, it's a little difficult to see the menu. And the food.   On my first visit, I had \"The Porky\" which has pork, potatoes, apples, onion and sage. It's served with this delicious red wine gravy. I should've stopped after I asked the waitress for a to-go box, but I couldn't stop eating. It was wonderful. As in AWESOME.  Today, I had the Lamb and Mint. It had lamb, rutabaga, onion and mint. Also, that wonderful red wine gravy. Killer good.   And by now, you're probably aware that all of these delights are contained in this \"pocket\" of dough, baked and neatly sliced in two when they serve it.  If you sit at the right-hand part of the bar, you can see the cooks prepare all of the food, and it's really quite an art.   The best thing is this: they have all different pasties for all different tastes...italian, mexican, vegetarian, greek and even an American Thanksgiving pasty with turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, stuffing and cranberry sauce.   Check out the menu and try this place. ! They have fabulous food, good music and lots of fun beers.   God save the Queen. And Cornish Pasties...."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a Vegan Pasty. It was really busy, but the mood was great and the food fantastic. I've been trying to go for a vegan four times in the past week, and I've discovered it's a really good idea to call in advance to ensure they can accommodate the animal-free eaters in your party.  Also had chips. Very tasty and cooked to perfection..   The waitress was slammed and apologized for a delay, but the food didn't really seem to take that long. I was able to go and come back on my lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place a a jewel of Phoenix.  It is one of the most unique, delicious, good ol' fashion home made cooking that will leave you begging for more.    As a small literal hole in the wall in a strip mall, you would never notice it if you didnt already know it was there.  We found this great place thanks to yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  The ambiance is fantastic; small, intimate, and classic with the painted cement floors and dark walls, it reminds me of New York back alley taverns.   The first night we went was absolutely PACKED full, but we still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table crouched cutely in the back.  Our server was personable, and after going there a few more times I can say the whole staff is spot on.    Now to the menu.  Great beer selection at great prices always adds a star for me.  But that is simply the prequel to the awesomeness that awaits you with the food.  I have had other food but the pasties here - the pasta salad is delicious, good strong greek salad too - but its useless to try to compare it to the pasties.  They have every combination imaginable, from the hearty shepards pie and the oogie to culture fusions like the cajun, the mexican, and one of my favorites, the lamb vindaloo.  You would never think that these ingredients could be packed into a puff pastry and come out incredibly delicious, but it seems to be more of a delightful delectable experience every time I go.    Their desserts are so good too, last time getting the Banoffee pie to go, which was sinful it was so good.  One of the best perks about this place though, is that you can bring any 1/2 cooked pasty home with you - it just takes 10 minutes in the oven - and tada you have awesomeness on hand at home anytime you want.... something i definitely recommend!  Yet again, thank you yelp for a favorite of Phoenix, and if you havent been here yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to stop in here for lunch and was not disappointed. Arrived right when they opened and was the first one to get served. Sweet!  This location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.  Their west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.  Started with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.  Everything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?  Don't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!  3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"This place has a huge selection of any kind of pasties you could imagine. I got the Cajun chicken pasty and it was delicious, packed with flavor. They're all made fresh with good ingredients. The atmosphere is laid back and isn't too loud either. We liked these better than the pasties we had in England!"}
{"text":"Chicken tikka was fantastic. Cool atmosphere. Hard to find and no clearly marked entrance.   Good beer selection and helpful wait staff. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our one year anniversary of our first date (which was also at cornish pasty :)). A year ago when I came hear I loved the ambiance and three dollar car bombs! However, I ordered the pasty my boyfriend recommended that had mashed potatoes (i hate mashed potatoes) due to first date jitters, so I could not appreciate how amazing the food is here. This time around I ordered the Greek Chicken Pasty and was blown away!! The dough is amazing and I was extremely pleased with my pasty. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wow!   My husband and I usually wander around the restaurants in our area spending good money and getting bland boring food.   Sadly we have grown accustomed to it.   But not here!  The food is great and the atmosphere is alive and vibrant.   We both started with soups, I had the mushroom and my husband had the red pepper.  They are both served with fresh bread and butter.   The soups were fantastic and a great value - honestly.   Our son had a pasty and curried potatoes.  A little on the salty side for my taste but the flavors were definitely there.   My husband and I shared a sausage salad and it was filled with veggies, cheeses and meat and very satisfying.  Loved the choices of beers and fresh iced teas as well.  We will be back.!"}
{"text":"I was invited to come through by the friends of the owners Andy and Frank, tried out their cajun pasty and it was freaking amazing! Great atmosphere and amazing food. Never knew about this place until tonight. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good music, cool place. I may stop back in the next time I'm in Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant... ever.   It's not the cutest place I've ever seen, not the friendliest staff I've ever met, but my god... they know how to make a damn pasty. And as a vegetarian, it blew my mind to see a food I would normally consider not veggie-friendly to come in so many vegan or vegetarian options. I am not huge on mock meat so I tend to stick with the Cheese & Potato pasty. However, what I have had of the mock meat is pretty crazy good. The dipping sauces are delicious and the breading of the pasty is phenomenal.   Great place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price (and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny)."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! They always have at least one vegan option for a pasty and I haven't had one I didn't like. The seating is kind of weird, they have really long tables so sometimes you're sitting with strangers, plus it's dark and loud but they have a nice outdoor seating area that is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Oh my oh my. Just like back in northern Minnesota. Crust was awesome and all the different flavors they offer was unbelievable.  They even have awesome desert pasty's and salads."}
{"text":"I had chicken tikka masala. It's awesome And chicken Asiago is damn tasty. I liked this place and I am going to be here again and again"}
{"text":"We ordered the Spicy asiago chicken pasty and \"little bit of salmon\" pasty. Both were beautifully presented with light flaky glazed crust. Inside, both were very tasty. They made for a tasty pasty (I had to make the joke)."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhhh Myyyyy Jeeeeebus, this was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. Vegan curried potato pasty and mushy peas. HEAVEN in a little strip mall dive in the desert of Vegas. Best meal we've had all weekend! At least three vegan options available, and entire vegetarian menu. Amazeballs"}
{"text":"This place is unique and has a super cool vibe. the owner is from Cornwall, England, accent and all, and seems like a real nice guy, working the ovens with the rest of the employees. the place is long and thin, and pretty small. if you sit at the bar that looks right into the kitchen, do not sit in front of the oven- every time they open the doors you get a blast of hot air. they used to do $3 Irish Car Bombs all the time, but not sure if they still do. a great little date place if you want someplace unique to share an intimate drink.  the pasties are huge and totally filling, though. so if you plan on doing anything after, be wary of eating the whole thing."}
{"text":"Bottles everywhere are brimming over with lightning. Blind squirrels near and far are dining on lavish feasts of nuts.   Dallas G. picked a lunch spot and it was amazing. I've been to the cornish pasty co before but not for a couple of years, and this time it was sublime. They have this pasty (essentially a mini calzone lookin' dealy with different innards) called the royale with cheese. Filled with burger, onions, fries, and such and served with 1000 island or whatever other goo you should like. Sublime.   It seems small but is filling, and our waitress is a lovable little thing, too. Hells yeah.   If I were a little more stuck up I might deduct one star for the ramshackle looking fellow in the chiefs hat who is running around doing various tasks--this is a food place, after all--but I'm not. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, incredible and the food is out of this world. Didn't expect this from a hole in the wall in Tempe! Cornish Pasty Company is a place you MUST visit if you are in the surrounding area. Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere puts you right into the heart of Eurpoe. A must have are the garlic \"chips\" which are actually thick french fries."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, building and decor are beautiful.  Our servers (forgot names sorry one is that big Hawaiian dude) went way above and beyond and to make sure we were happy, and the beer and liquor choices are bomb."}
{"text":"Food is good.  The inside is nicer and bigger than the old location but the parking sucks.  Portions are good sized and I like the pomegranate green tea.  The meatballs are good and most of the pasties are good."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Casual and delicious. Awesome traditional pasty, reminds me of my family's recipe. Other great renditions of pasty as well but you just can't beat the Oggie. The Scottish Eggs and Chicken Wing appetizers are awesome too. Love that you can order a half baked pasty to go and finish cooking it at home"}
{"text":"I've had take out from Cornish Pasty a couple times the latest was the most incredible Pilgrim pasty stuffed with Turkey, sweet potatoes, onion, cranberry and complete with a wine sauce for dipping, made you feel like you had a warm Thanksgiving dinner, minus the pumpkin pie. Then after reading Preston's ROTD the fabulous Monica J sent me an invite for lunch to our closest location. The restaurant is a bit dark but inviting and our waitress Jenny got us served up in no time.(greatly appreciated on a worktime lunch hour) I ordered the Bangers and Mash Pasty, homemade pork with sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions and potatoes and more wine gravy on the side, not enough to make you tipsy but it does leave you feeling warm and fuzzy like good comfort food should. If you're looking to satisfy your appetite with warm comfort food, this is the place! Top notch pasties everytime!"}
{"text":"Wow! We initially went to BYBLOS but they didn't come to our table for 10 mins and then shouted at me for wanting to leave. Yeah - not what I call \"hospitable\" - not sure I will go back. It was the older, bald man about 70 years old.  So we found this place via Yelp. It had to be God's will BECAUSE this place ROCKS! Plenty of Vegan/Vegetarian options too!!! It is a hip scene and the atmosphere is a little gritty; reminiscent of a British Punk bar without the drug addicts pissing in the dark corners. The food was rib-sticking food - like a coal miner would eat! (That is their theme - coal mining). Our server, Brandon, made some terrific recommendations and was efficient. They play cool tunes - but kinda loud. So if you're looking to talk and be heard - sit outside.  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, delicious food! My daughter found the Cornish Pasty Company through Yelp. This was where we decided to eat for our first meal in Las Vegas. We drove out to Charleston Boulevard. It was super crowded. We were lucky that we beat the dinner crowd and got a table. Yay!  We enjoyed reading about the history of the Cornish Pasty on the menu. It was connected with the Irish miner's story.  Our server was super nice. I wish I could remember his name. He was super helpful with recommendations. We ordered the traditional Oggy. We also got the Shepherd's pie with lamb. From Yelp recommendations, we read that we should not forget the sides, so we ordered the garlic mash and the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. The pasties were alright. The short crust is not too sweet and was quite thin. However, we still felt that we needed more filling. On the red wine sauce, our table was mixed. I loved it, but agreed that it was so savory and strong that it could easily overpower some of the more subtle flavors in the pasties.  We ended the night with the apple caramel pasty a la mode. It came to our table piping hot. Be warned, it is so hot, it can scald. We cut open the apple pasty and the juice spurted and scalded my daughter. It started to blister. We asked the server if he could find some burn ointment. He brought back a packet of aloe balm and Bandaids. We were thankful for their response and assistance.  We are thrilled to find out there is a location in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"Fun, unique selection of delicious food that you'll find nowhere else in town, great selection of cold beers, cozy dark atmosphere, friendly staff. Not sure why people are saying it's in a sketchy neighborhood -- I think the worst thing that will happen to you is you might get asked for spare change in the parking lot, but trust me, you are perfectly safe coming here. Can't speak to the \"authenticity\" of these pasties, but they sure are good, and I love that there's such a variety of flavors/textures to try.  I'm sad I discovered this place right before I moved out of state."}
{"text":"Great food, helpful service, but challenging space.  Tip: The entrance to the main dining is super difficult to find. If you park in the lot in front of CheBa Hut, walk past the first door that says Cornish Pasty Company and go through the second one. They have a back entrance also, but it is virtually impossible for me to describe how to get in. When you step in, you see the kitchen from both doors and might freak out because you'd think that you walked into the kitchen, but you are in the right place. When you walk in further, you will see the chairs. It is self-seating. Find a booth, table or sit at the bar. Your server will come to you.  Watch out for the banister when you sit in the upper level. The banister is not really for support but a part of the decor. It was not secure and popped up when I leaned on it.  The food was consistently good like the Cornish Pasty Company we tried in Las Vegas. The broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake was to die for. Slightly more al dente than the bake we had in Vegas, but it was still good. We loved scraping and eating the crusty cheese.   I enjoyed the Guiness Stew filled with a rich, robust, boozy filling (steak, mushroom, onion and carrots). My friend enjoyed her Cottage Pie (ground beef filling). We had the Shepherd's Pie (ground lamb filling) in Vegas. The pastry was beautifully golden brown. We had no room for dessert.  Watch out! The food is served piping hot here as well.  Lucky Tempe, you have a Cornish Pasty Company in your neighborhood. I am super jealous."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this location.  Today, I ordered at the Mill location and the customer service sucked big time.  I was trying to call in a order for pick up and was placed on HOLD for 40 minutes.  Despicable behavior.  I went to the University location (which is my normal location to visit) and they took care of me as they always do.  Thank you to the manager for listening to my concern and making me feel valued as a customer.  This is why you continue to get my business and are the FAVORITE of all the locations that you have.  Keep up the good work.  I appreciate you because you appreciate me."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Enjoyed everything this place had to offer.  A  rare find, considering it's location."}
{"text":"A great modern take on a British Pub Standard.  Excellent beer options too. Incredibly helpful and attentive staff.  Easily one the best options in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.    First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.     That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.     The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...     Eat here. It's really that simple.      Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the Pilgrim. Couldn't finish all of it (big pie) but it was really tasty. Don't miss out on this \"hole in the wall\" find."}
{"text":"Better than the reviews! Just what I needed my last night of business in Vegas. The Oggie is a traditional pastie with a great rich gravy side. The \"plain\" fries have crushed peppercorns in them - AMAZING! Shannon provided excellent and friendly service. I can't wait to visit next time I am in town. Yelp may need a 6-star rating for this place!"}
{"text":"What is not to like!  Food are interesting and wonderful. Service is attentive. Great place."}
{"text":"I liked the food and beer here. A pasty is like a calzone/stromboli and a pot pie put together, and they're all huge. No side order required! However, they've got a wide variety of beer and also tea/coffee to have with it, and the friendly staff don't mind you hanging out for a bit. it's pricey enough that I wouldn't say come here all the time, but it's a good spot for an evening meal."}
{"text":"The best selection of Cornish pasties this side of the pond.  You name it, they have it. Chicken Tikka masala, carne adovada, Cajun chicken, the list goes on... Also a great place to watch a game with a large projection screen and drink specials."}
{"text":"i have never had a pasty before and i have to say i am a true believer!  absolutely delicious! we had the royale with cheese and the shepards pie. also tried the fries and the mushy peas. i love me some mushy peas!  so happy with this place, it was so rich and filling and the ingredients tasted so fresh. we were all blown away.   the restaurant itself is really nice as well. very industrial and hip. i like the whole decor and the light fixtures. they even have real church pews as their benches.   next time we are in vegas i will always be visiting this place again for sure!"}
{"text":"I give very few places 5/5 stars, but this place is so good, and so consistently impeccable that i just had to. I get the Raspberry jam & PB from the desert menu for the kids, and always get tge bangers & mash pasty. Incredible every time!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Cornish Pasty was about two years ago, and it rocked. I just went again last week with the boyfriend, and it impressed me so much again the second time again I felt compelled to yelp about it!  We arrived there at around 6pm on a Friday night. Luckily, we grabbed the last table of two without having to wait at all! As many previous reviewers have mentioned, this place is not good for large parties. There are four 2-seater tables along the right side of their narrow dining room, a full service bar along the left side, and a couple slightly larger tables that seat 4 along the back, and that's it.   The atmosphere is offbeat and funky. It's pretty dark in there, so it feels like a cave, but in a good way. Like you stumbled into the lair of a friendly Giant who happens to bake the best damn pasties you've ever had on the reg, and wants to share.   Service was quick and friendly. We started off with a large house salad to split with their house lemon pesto vinaigrette dressing. Yum!  It was more than enough for two people to share for a first course - we could barely even finish it.   I ordered the Shepherd's Pie pasty with the minted lamb, and OMG. This thing was fantastic. It took my experience to the next level. Oozing cheese, garlicky mashed potatoes, crispy buttery pastry crust, and this amazing seasoned lamb. I had the Pilgrim pasty the first time I ate here a few years ago, and it was very good, but this Shepherd's pie pasty blew it out of the water. Not to mention the red wine gravy served with it. NOM NOM NOM.   I was so stuffed after eating half our salad and half of my huge pasty that I absolutely HAD to say no to dessert (note: this is very unlike me :)). The next time I go (and there WILL be a next time, and soon) I plan to try either the banoffee pie or the cinnamon apple pasty!  Bottom line: This place is excellent. Reasonable prices for very generous portions, there are plenty of options and definitely something for everyone. If you have yet to try it, check it out the next time you are in the Tempe area!   Bonus: you'll probably even have leftovers to take home and enjoy later!"}
{"text":"Love the back side dive bar. They have updated it yet kept the dive vibe. Would give it 5 stars except the 3 times I've been there around 11 they start playing death metal. I understand it a hipster bar, love it, but straight up death metal isn't conducive for everyone in a bar or restaurant setting. Can barely have a convo."}
{"text":"A great place to get British pub grub. This place is known for their pasties and they have a lot of variety. They offer more traditional pasties as well as unique pasties such as the Royale with Cheese and the Lamb Vindaloo pasty. The pastry is thin, buttery, and flaky which compliments the flavors of the pasty fillings. Portion sizes are decent, the pasties are pretty filling. Service was very friendly and casual. The dining area is very spacious and has a cool hipster urban atmosphere. They only have street parking."}
{"text":"I had the Salmon pasty and it was pretty amazing. I wouldn't recommend the Pb&J Banana pasty for dessert."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co. is a solid neighborhood spot for great beer and a big selection of pasties (booze bombs as I call 'em). The staff is almost always friendly and on top of service. There are plenty of pasties to choose from and good salads if you wanna go that direction...good atmosphere/tunes...never feels empty."}
{"text":"Been wanting to hit this place up for awhile! The atmosphere is casual and its mostly bar seating with tables lining the walls. The bar only offers beer. But, they have a great selection of local and craft beers. The food is pretty unique as there is nothing in vegas like it. The cusine is Pasty/German and its not hard to find a combination of ingredients that you will like."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I met my friend Allison and her husband Joel here for dinner. They had been here before and said it was really good. My first time ever having a pasty, past-eee is how you pronounce it. So what is a pasty? It's like if a hot pocket and a calzone had a baby. There are a bunch of different fillings and flavors to choose from, and then the fillings are baked in a delicious, crusty shell.    I started with a Wells Banana Bread beer, which is one of my favorites! The beer was really good and sooooo refreshing on a hot summer night. It was uncomfortably hot inside the restaurant. We asked if they could turn down the ac, but it was already down as low as it could go. Apparently they are getting their ducts looked at because they are obviously not working well. We were all sweating which did not make for a pleasant dining experience. Luckily I had the ice cold beer to help keep me cool.   I had a hard time deciding what to eat, as I always do. I ended up choosing the Cheese Steak pasty and my bf got the Royale which is a cheeseburger and fries. I also ordered a side of chips (fries) with garlic and jalapeños. The chips came out first, and they were a little too well-done because the garlic was burnt. I probably wouldn't order these again. My pasty was filled with delicious steak, cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. It came with red wine gravy and mustard cream on the side. The red wine gravy was bomb. The mustard cream was tasty as well. I tried my bf's royale, and it was good, but I definitely preferred my pasty over his. As if the food and beer wasn't enough, I decided to get the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. It was to die for!  I love dessert and this is now one of my favorites. This place is great. It's a new concept, unlike anything I have had before. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a function downtown today, planned on eating at Cornish Pasty....until we saw the #redfored sign.   We will not be supporting a political organization that uses children as pawns nor will we support the sheep that blindly follow them."}
{"text":"I love food but this place had me talking about how much I loved their food!!  I had the pilgrim pasty and the fries with garlic.  Wow!!  I can't wait to go back and try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent pot pie & witty, amazing service. Very quaint atmosphere but enjoyable for the worker bees that are traveling."}
{"text":"Vegan eggplant pie was really good .... other items were also good . A lot of great choices for vegan people . I can't say I have seen that many options for vegan in other restaurants . Must try for vegan people . Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite! Super cool vibe and nice people and super dark inside which makes the atmosphere even better. Doesn't hurt that the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim one evening with some friends, had it bookmarked for quite some time and was very excited to finally go get me some meat pies!! now with my roots coming from the great state of Minnesota, I know a thing or two about pasties and let me tell ya, the pasties are OUTA SITE ya you betcha!   we decided to order a bunch of different pasties and share among the group. I warn you of this, these things are no joke!! they are big........big i tell ya!!! I was only able to sample two of the mighty meat pies that graced our table that evening, the Meat and Cheese and the Chicken Alfredo. The Meat and Cheese is a meat lovers dream, unbelievable sausage flavor and that red wine gravy is the perfect compliment to the fillings and the flaky crust. The Chicken Alfredo was creamy and full of flavor with bunches of tender, juicy chicken and a perfect crust."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Every pasty is the bomb you can't go wrong. The desert is a must as well."}
{"text":"My go to unique Phoenix Restaurant that I take people to when they are in town. Any soup, half a Carne Adovada, and the treacle desert is the best meal I can think of"}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic pasties, fantastic desserts. Took some home to finish baking at home for the next couple of days. I will be back anytime we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good pub grub & great beer selection! Call ahead to order if you're in a hurry. Oggie is delicious."}
{"text":"Shut the front door!  Actually we came in the back door, and we did shut it when we came in...  I was brought here by a good friend who told me  1. They had $4 car bombs and  2. Pastys I hadn't had a pasty since I was a kid, so this place was definitely our stop after enjoying the 48 hour filmfest at ReBar.  I didn't quite know what to expect, certainly not church pews (so freaking cool) or the dark, broody, yet inviting vibe of the place. Checking out the menu I was a little surprised by the prices.  If I recall correctly it was about $10-$15/pasty.  What?  When I was a kid they were like $2.  Times they have a changed.  There was only 1 non meat pasty and it had salmon, asparagus, and a cream sauce so the twin and I split that one while our local friend ordered the Thanksgiving one.  I was a tad jealous - it sounded AMAZING.  Apparently I'm a little special and I needed to look on the back of the menu for the vegetarian options...oops....next time.. So the pasty arrives and it's freaking HUGE.  No wonder the price.  The pasty from my childhood would be a very small appetizer, this was a meal for 2. Literally, I and the twin were full after eating half.  And WOW, the dough was cooked perfectly with just a hint of crunch on the outside and the cream sauce with that salmon!  Glorious, my taste buds were in heaven.  This girl was seriously impressed.  So was the twin. My only regret is that they don't offer one that is just veggies...with that sauce.  MMM...doooo it...."}
{"text":"delicious salads, soups, sides and (of course) pasties. if you're not sure what a pasty is, then just go try one. seriously, you won't regret it. tons of vegetarian and meaty options. i'm convinced that there isn't a bad choice on their menu... if there is, then i haven't found it yet.  it's a pretty small place with a pub vibe. it takes a little while for them to prepare your food, so if you're in a rush, i'd suggest calling ahead."}
{"text":"We are on vacation and local friends hosting us suggested that we hit this place up. He's an aussie, so his penchant for the Commonwealth's Meat Pies is legendary.   The food was outstanding, got the Parliament Wings to start - they rock. I love when wings are crispy, and these were perfect.   My husband and I got the lamb vindaloo, our aussie got the cottage pie, and my other friend got the Reuben. We all shared pieces with one another and were not disappointed by the flavors.   My aussie friend was in his glory with the Pavlova dessert. He said it isn't 100% pure Australia but if you can get something 99% there, it's super worth it. Waitress brought over 4 spoons for us all to share and my friend had us all tuck in. It was pretty splendid.  Waitstaff was attentive, friendly, and super.   I have two minor criticisms: First, it's freaking dark in there. I have never been into a darker cave in my life to eat food. Second, only one local craft brew on tap was disappointing. I love sampling the local beers when I travel, so I would have loved a choice of three or four.   I'd totally come back here, even just for takeout. ASU students - I hope you know how good you got it.   Cheers, mate."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by this place's location - while it may seem a little sketch the food here is delicious and it is absolutely a diamond in the rough. This was my first time dining here and I was here for lunch with my coworkers. The service was quick and our server was very polite. I had the Chicken Tikka Pasty and let me tell you it was amazing! If you can't do spicy I don't recommend this particular option, however with that said I typically get 'medium' spicy levels wherever I go and this was the perfect amount of spice. The cal-zone-esque pastry dough filled goodness was comprised of chicken tikka, red curry, potatoes, and green peppers. Don't let the pictures fool you either - one pasty is more than enough food to fill you up! Highly recommend a stop at Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"I CANNOT BELIEVE these EXIST!!!!!!!! Their pasties are out of this world!!  The dough they use is light, not crumbly, and perfect, just perfect.  The fillings - HA amazing!!  the flavors will blow your mind.  I could not finish mine (cause their HUGE) so I brought it home.  Had it two days later - e-v-e-n better!  The beer selection is phenomenal.  When we first arrived, my husband and I walked in and the waitress said \"sit anywhere\" and we sat behind another couple at a table.  The waitress never came to our table after 20 minutes passed - not even to take a drink order.  So two seats popped open at the bar & we bee lined for them.  Thats when all became good in the world of pasties and beer.  Do not pass this place up - stop in."}
{"text":"Interesting name, Interesting place. Pretty darn good food! Had an enjoyable lunch of Habiscis Iced Tea and a Cottage Pie Pasty. I was bummed they were out of oven chips.  The restaurant is small and narrow, but packs in a good crowd.  If it wasn't lunch and I didn't have a long way to drive, I would have tried a beer, since they are a pub too. The waitress did a good job keeping my tall glass of tea filled. The food doesn't come out quickly, but thats fine since the pasty was delicious. My friend who I met there for lunch mentioned how it would be nice if they had a sampler platter of select pasties to try, as there is a plethora of choices on the menu, including a list of vegetarian pasties. If I am in Tempe in the near future, I'll make sure to remember this place. Not easy to find at first, but a darn good discovery to make."}
{"text":"We came in around 10pm on a Friday night for some food after a long 7 hr drive from New Mexico. The atmosphere is like a laid back pub. Their specialty are pasties which is kind of like a calzone + meat pie mixed into one. The menu explains the origin was from a place called Cornwell in the UK where the mothers/wives of miners would make these calzone meat pies for their men as their lunch when they're in the mining fields. There's a bar in the middle of the place and long community style tables where you can seat yourself in. Lots of young people here but it wasn't very crowded at all. Plenty of empty seats (which is a little strange for a Friday night for such a popular place with over 1000 yelp reviews).  We ordered the CHICKEN GREEK SALAD and the COTTAGE PIE PASTY. Both dishes were super delicious. The chicken in the salad was so moist and tender. The pasty was freshly made and deliciously cheesy. My fiancé ordered the MONK SOUR BEER and he said it was really good as well. Not a bad meal after a long drive. The servers were attentive and have great sense of music (I think I found my playlist twin there - Mariah Carey Fantasy album, Beyoncé check on it, Salt n Pepper)   If we are ever in the area again we would def stop by."}
{"text":"It's pretty much an over-priced hot pocket. I didn't like it.  I got  the;   Spicy Asiago Chicken $9.00 Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes. With a side of sour cream & salsa.  It tasted a little like a Mexican / Italian hot pocket because of the \"stewed tomatoes\".   My husband got the:  Peppered Steak $9.80 Sirloin steak, sautéed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini, and Stilton cheese (Imported English bleu cheese). With a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce.  Good quality meat but again, tasted almost like a hot pocket."}
{"text":"Ive always been a fan of Cornish Pasty and have enjoyed trying different items on their menu. This location, like the others, offer a dark atmosphere. However with its downtown location, there are multiple levels, and the upstairs is quite spacious with ample seating and views to the street below. Great service and my drink was filled every time. My go to favorites are the Pilgrim and Chicken Pesto. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! I have taken several people and everyone has loved it. Vegetarians as well as meat eaters all enjoy Cornish Pasty Company. There is a ton of choices, even if you are not feeling the pasty have the side of mashed potato's there are great as well."}
{"text":"The place is small but the atmosphere is very chilled. The Cornish Pasty tastes great and the location is a plus!"}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews on Yelp, but In this case I had to make an exception. The name \"Cornish Pasty Co\" is a little disingenuous. The crust is way off, too buttery, not enough fat, not enough salt, etc. And the seam is definitely in the wrong place. \"Marie Calendar's Pasty Company\" would be a better name.     That said, the food is priced pretty low for what you get, and they are made from scratch.  It's actually a nice place for lunch if you're not expecting authentic pastys."}
{"text":"We stopped in to check out this interesting restaurant late last night on our way back from dinner. We wanted to take a look at their menu and get a good draft beer to take the heat off of the sweltering evening.   The pasty options are amazing - taking up an entire page of the large menu. We sat at the bar and watched them making a batch of 12 pasties. Their chef carefully constructed each pasty and cleaned the tables so meticulously. It was fun to watch!   We have a British restaurant in our home town and we were so excited to see mushy peas on the menu! We ordered some even though we already ate dinner a few hours before. They were cooked in a little cast iron pot and tasted delicious.   The bartender was super friendly and efficient. Beer selection is solid. Hoping to get back to try a pasty before we leave town."}
{"text":"Amazing Atmosphere, Music, Draft Beer, Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty, Church Pews(Feels Like I'm in Heaven), Banaffee Pie! And Customer Service was great!"}
{"text":"My first review at the new location, though, I have visited several times since the move. Also, the first I've visited during daylight hours, normally I keep vampire hours. I love the new building, I love the vibe, I especially love the food!  Yay me, tried a new pasty today...Rosemary Chicken and plum cider...nummy! Marinated chicken breast, roasted red potatoes, brie, roasted red peppers, and fresh rosemary. With a side of mustard cream sauce. I only did the pasty as I wanted a Sticky Toffee Pudding to myself....I had a hard week at work...'that's my story and I'm sticking to it.'   A great dining experience...as usual."}
{"text":"I must be the one person who doesn't \"get\" this place. Maybe I don't like British food? Maybe I don't like loud music, and poor service?   We visited this place to celebrate my girlfriend Sarah's 30th Birthday. We were seated outside because it was SO loud inside, we didn't think we would be able to hear ourselves think. The waitress too a bit too long to greet us, or even take our drink orders. Our food took even longer.   I split the Cottage Pasty with my friend, and my half was chilly in the middle. That aside, pasty is NOT my cup of tea.   I ordered the PB&J pasty for desert thinking maybe that would be more up my ally, but it was an odd mix of flavor, and still not my thing.   I didn't drink,  but I may consider coming back to check out their tap because it seemed impressive, but I will eat BEFORE I come."}
{"text":"PANTERA plus Spectacular food plus super hot bar tender...jalapeño margaritas.  Need I say more??"}
{"text":"Unique food that packs a punch! I just wish for the price I could end up a little more full."}
{"text":"Okay, I'll readily admit my ignorance: I had no clue what a \"pasty\" was before I came here.  I'd honestly never even heard of them.  Never once.  So when I got out of the car and looked at the place my friend had taken me, I know that the question \"what the heck is a pasty and why is there a company for them?\" went through my head.  I looked at the menu (I even read the little history blurb) and still had no clue.  So, when a wee calzone-like pasty comes out, filled with the making of a Reuben sandwich, I was very intrigued.  Compared to my hunger, this thing looked puny.  But the smell, the steam, and crispiness of the pastry itself were just too good to be disappointed.  I was not at all displeased.  There is a HUGE menu of these things too!  There is a page of classic ones, signature ones, and even vegetarian ones.  The place itself is dark and cozy with a unique diner/bar charm.  Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I'd probably give this place 5 stars, except that no place deserves 5 stars until I've had at least three stellar experiences there. Give me a few weeks, I bet I can make that happen.  I stopped in here on Sunday for lunch about 1pm. We walked in to this small, narrow... PACKED bar. Misconception #1, it never occurred to me that we might not be able to get a table!! There was one very large rectangular table near the back, and thankfully the trio seated on just one side of the huge table, graciously allowed my party of two to take the other side. Whew.  I ordered a beer (The waitress even recommended one that wasn't on the menu yet, nice touch) and my sister, who is much better behaved than I am, ordered a water. I ordered the chicken tikka masala pasty (I'm sure it's not really traditional but I have a thing for indian food at the moment) and my  sister got the Chicken Greek.   And we waited... and waited. OK, Misconception #2  :) I mistakenly thought this would be sort of a fast-food place.  It wasn't! It was about a 40 minute wait for the food. And I am NOT complaining... I'm just saying... I had a misconception! It was SO GOOD I'd have waited double the time (although I'd be drunk by that time, considering what a good beer selection they  have, no good would come from that!). Incidentally, the service was quite good and responsive, especially considering how busy they were.   My chicken tikka masala was very flavorful, but only slightly spicy (The waitress told me they make their curry in-house, I assume they make it only mildly spicy to accommodate all diners), I was impressed. My only complaint is that the potatoes inside my tikka masala pasty were still quite firm... but that's probably a matter of personal preference. I like potatoes well done, not still firm. My sister was very happy with her Chicken Greek and she's such a picky eater (I love you Julie!) that it's a damn miracle she liked it that much.   Oh, and our bill was like $22.00. Awesome, I can afford to come here all the time!! We will certainly be back, I look forward to being able to upgrade this place to 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was good.  I had the Cottage Pie - piping hot!  Unfortunately, they were out of the Shepherd's Pie, Bangers and Mash, and the Royale with Cheese.  Bummer.  Those were my first 3 choices, so I had to settle for the fourth.  One of my dining companion's mother is British and makes pasties.  She said these were very good and authentic.  She wished they had a full bar.   The seats were so uncomfortable, both the bar and the church pews.  I'm a skinny person and found it very difficult to get in and out of the tables.  I saw that my companions of normal weight had trouble with the seating too.  They need to do something about that.  Service was decent.  The reception from the bartender was a little chilly, but our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  The narrow galley style eatery can have a wait if going during prime dinner time.  Love the Thanksgiving themed pasty."}
{"text":"Amazing find!! Stuffed pastries with creamy goodness. The pastry isz perfectly golden brown and flakey, and they offer enough options that anyone can find the perfect stuffing. The place doesn't look like much from the outside but is well decorated and pretty cool on the inside. Bartenders make great drinks, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"This location has a nice relaxing vibe. The inside is very dark and unique. But there is also a nice large outdoor patio that is dog friendly!   This was my first time to a Cornish Pasty and I was impressed! They have a huge selection of beer and drinks! I settled on an IPA of course. As for the pasty, I was talked into trying the Italian and I was impressed. The sauce and the meats were a great combo. If anything it's a fancy calzone but worth it!   The service was also great! Our waitress was really nice and informative and frequently came by to check in on us! Definitely want to come back and try other pasties."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here with my family and my in-laws. Excellent.   Some background.  My wife and her family are from London. My in-laws retired to Cornwall, and my wife and I were actually married in Camelford, Cornwall. We used to hang out at pubs for a pint and to grab a pasty.   Long story short: my father in law, after dinner tonight said, \"These are better than the ones in Cornwall,\" referring to the pasties here at the Cornish Pasty Company.   The atmosphere is casual and almost like a pub in the country in Cornwall.   Can't wait to go back. Great beer on tap selection, too.   EXCELLENT evening. Thank you."}
{"text":"Service was amazeballs. Food was bomb. Great for vegetarians. So incredibly good! Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"I thought everything was great and then when my native brit and anglofile (who went to school at king's college) friends  both also approved... Then what can you say? My only worry is that they're not advertising themselves enough because it was pretty dead at lunch in a Saturday."}
{"text":"Imagine you are a hot pocket...  Now imagine you could be filled with any type of food...  Throw in some great music...  Some faint allusion to a microwave...  Godspeed!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Cornish Pasty co! We ordered from them 2 days in a row because we were instantly addicted.  This review is solely based on their food, since I had it delivered and didn't actually get to see the restaurant. I've never had a Pasty before, but it's basically the English version of an empanada or calzone. The pastry dough is so light and flaky, and surrounds so many different flavor options that we had to go back and try more. I had the cottage pie (shepherds pie with beef) and the lamb vindaloo. I loved the cottage pie and couldn't stop eating it. The lamb was a little chewy and very spicy, but was still good. You can also order some of them par baked to heat up at home. 1 Pasty per person should be enough, since they are pretty large."}
{"text":"We love this place. They have awesome beer, their food is all amazing, and it's a fun atmosphere. We come here with friends a lot and always leave happy."}
{"text":"I ate here last weekend and it was my first \"Pasty\" experience and hope to be many more when I'm back in Vegas!   -First impressions: located in a unique place, cute signage, and inside has a cool, dark atmosphere that's cozy and a perfect start to a night out on the town with unique vibes -Opted for open seating, no wait.. high table and just order food and drinks from the bar  -Excellent bartender: service with a smile and extra crafty on the stiff drinks =] -Amazing *Pear Diem* cocktail: Monkey Shoulder, St. George Spiced Pear, Fresh Lime Juice, Barrel Aged Grade B Maple Syrup, Egg White -Unique *Experimental Old Fashioned*: El Silencio Mezcal, Luxardo Maraschino, Homemade Chai Tea Syrup, Whiskey Barrel-aged Bitters... extra smoky and great! -MMmM *Moscow Mule* drink with Ketel One Vodka! ;D  -*Cottage Pie Pasty* was delightful (seasoned ground beef with peas and carrots, grilled onion, mashed potato and cheddar with a side of red wine gravy).. the savory filling inside the pastry puff crust was fresh and flavorful and the dipping sauce complimented it all very well.   Great food, cocktails with a nice touch, friendly service, and cool atmosphere = 5 Stars.~"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the traditional Pasty and it did not disappoint.  The meat was moist and the crust was done to perfection! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  Everything was delicious that I tried.  The bread and butter deserves a special mention.  Even though the pasty I got was very good, and the soup was excellent, the bread and butter really jumped out at me.    I enjoyed the outdoor seating area for my lunch, though I must say inside was much too dark for lunch... when you walk in it is so dark it seems like nighttime pub atmosphere (a little strange in my book).  Other than that, a superb place with great food and service as well."}
{"text":"Our server was Casey and all I have to say is WOW! She was so friendly an acomidating! She explained everything about the menu an recommended some great dishes! We had the wings, which were outstanding! We also had the Italian pasty! It was delicious! Thank you Casey for making this a night to remember! We will definitely be telling all our friends about this little jem!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to AZ and I'm glad we found this place for lunch on our second day cause that means we can make it back again before we leave I had the chicken Greek and a small Greek salad.  Both were just absolutely delicious. The place was packed and we ended up int the last table in the back.  It was hot and our service was slow.  The decor is dark and hipster but still I loved it"}
{"text":"Having just returned from a week in Cornwall where I subsisted on a daily ration of a pasty and a bowl of soup, i had high expectations. I bought two of the traditional pasties, took them home and finished cooking them according to directions.  They are way too hot! The spicy pepper or chili seasoning overwhelms the goodness of the meat, potato, and (presumably) rutabaga. The pastry was good, the ingredients were good, but the spice has no business being in a Cornish pasty."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could. I love this place. I eat the Oggie. If you get it parbaked to take home, it's cheaper. Sometimes they forget to write down oven directions, so ask!"}
{"text":"Previously, I had only been to the old location once and thought it was just ok.  I hadn't even realized that they had moved locations until my friend asked me to go that night when we were down the road.    So I really don't like this area of town.  They have some cool bars and restaurants but it seems really unsafe to me.  That being said, we went in and the place was very welcoming and nicely decorated.  I felt right at home!  It wasn't too busy but after about 5 minutes a giant crowd came in and the place came to life.  The bar was popping, people were mingling, and everybody was having a good time.    I got a Spicy Chicken Asiago pasty and it was very tasty!  It was better than the more traditional one that I had when I was at the original location.   Let me tell you all, the bartenders here are tops!  Super friendly and personable, generous on drinks, leave you alone if you want to be left alone and talk to you if you want to talk.  It may have just been this visit but I had a great time here and can definitely see myself coming back here and having another great time!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing as usual, the service however was awful. We had 6 different people wait on our table and each time we'd ask someone to send our server they would say they would and we'd never see him. We finally gave up asking him for things and started asking anyone walking by our table when the need would arise. All in all the food is always delicious and the service was okay at best."}
{"text":"I've probably been to this place 100 times!!! The Cajun chicken is my favorite. I dream about it all the time! I was really impressed with the service and atmosphere. I will continue to goback all the time. I couldn't think of one bad thing so they deserve five star every time"}
{"text":"I had no idea what a \"pastie\" was prior to eating here but my wife saw this place and immediately exclaimed that we had to go here, I have to say I am so glad we did! The food is so fresh and delicious! Who knew that a little pocket sandwich could have so much flavor! And their soups are amazing! I had the Potato leak soup as a starter and opted for just a cup full but I could have easily eaten 2 bowls in one sitting! Everything here just tastes amazingly fresh! For dinner I got the chicken pot pie pastie and my wife got the Shepard pie and wow was it good. Besides the food the servers were so nice and friendly and atmosphere in the establishment is so cozy, the place is dimly lit to give it that warm feeling that pairs well with the food! I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food but I definitely did not enjoy the interior dining experience. I will happily get my future food to go. Their british pub concept could be so cool, but instead it was really dark (blackout curtains on every window), way too loud (blaring music), and just overall way too hipster grunge for me (hello, Seattle). Dining experience aside, the menu is giant and the food is really good. I had: -  Greek Pasty: Vegetarian and I absolutely loved all the flavors in it. It was full of cheese, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all wrapped up in a warm buttery crust.  - House Salad: Really fresh (amazing tomatoes) and good-sized.  - Sticky Toffee Pudding: Having read about the dessert in English books, I've always wanted to try it. It was pretty good but probably not something I'd order again. After this dish and watching enough Downtown Abbey, I finally get that the English call their cakes \"pudding\". So it's not pudding at all, but a cake. There really wasn't enough of a toffee flavor, and instead most of the cake had a mild molasses flavor. Parts of the cake were really dry, so the vanilla ice cream its served with made it a lot better. This is certainly a fun dessert to try, but not totally my favorite.  I only ate half of my pasty at dinner, then ate the other half a few hours later in the comfort of my own home, and definitely enjoyed the leftover half in my home a whole lot more. So overall, I really recommend the food, just in a to-go form :)"}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant a few nights ago while eating at a Thai place next door. We wondered what it was. We were at a convention and I ran into a friend from Arizona that recommended it, especially when he heard we had a vegetarian in our group. It was an excellent recommendation.  I had a hard time deciding which item to order since it all looked so good. I ended up ordering an Italian, chips, and the leek soup. The leek soup was absolutely perfect. I know when I go home,I'll crave this. Alas, I live thousands of miles away. The Italian pasty great,  but not as good as the soup. The whole meal was good and l liked the atmosphere.  It seemed like a very cool place and I'm glad we found it. This place is definitely worth trying. The vegetarian options were plentiful and were very tempting."}
{"text":"The Skinny: sporting a short crust pastry shell, the unique and innovative flavors will have you coming back again (3.75) service: not bad for a British pub (4) value: for about $10ish you get a pretty good tuck in (4).  This joint kind of feels like a hole in the wall pub from the outside so I was relieved that it had a little bit of a modern decor inside. With the black walls sporting old photographs of Cornish miners (I am assuming), the small intimate space has a cozy vibe to it. The music, thankfully, isn't too intrusive and you can carry a nice conversation which is a change from most bars/pubs. They have 3 types of seating - a few communal tables, small tables and bar stools. Thankfully free of smoke, it is actually a pleasant environment to have a meal.  We were starving after catching a movie before dinner so we ordered three different flavours of pasty - the chicken tikka masala, the eggplant parm, and the chicken pot pie. To be frank, I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we barely made a dent in the third pasty. It is nice that the pasty is served cut in half which made it nice for sharing.   Our pies came in a rather timely manner - within 15 minutes of ordering which was a godsend.   First let's talk about the crust. The pies have a short crust pastry which leads to a crisp, slightly crumbly texture. It is not a puff pastry or your standard flaky pie crust. It held up quite well considering the moisture from the filling. It had a beautiful golden color and had the perfect thickness to match.  That being said, to not overwhelm the crust, the filling tends to be a bit on the drier side. So you must consume the pastry with the accompanying dipping sauce. It not only provides contrasting flavours, it enhances the overall \"mouth-feel\".  Chicken tikka masala - a little on the spicier side, I found this pasty to really require the cool yogurt mint sauce that it comes with. The flavors are pretty good - I think the marinade could use a tinge more acidity, a little bit smokier (from fire roasted tomatoes, of course!) and perhaps dial back on the spice level. Overall, pretty satisfying. This was my hubby's favourite.  Eggplant parm - I like the fact that this pasty is brimming with vegetables but the crust totally holds (ie, it isn't soggy at all!). The combination of the marinara, mozarella and variety of vegetables makes this a very satisfying meal. This was my favourite.  Chicken pot pie - a little bit unbalanced in the flavour (it had a bit too strong celery taste in the pot pie and could have used a bit more carrot - bonus would be to add some umami to this dish), this was probably our least favourite of the three. The chicken/thyme gravy was a little bit too thick and was overly salty.  Service was quick and efficient. Our server was pretty nice, refilled our water glasses promptly even though she was the only one serving and she even offered to refill some of the dipping sauces for us even though we didn't need it.  Overall, I was very satisfied by my visit here considering the level of cuisine, the service and the value (pasties set you back around $9+ pretip/tax). I would recommend this place for vegetarians - they really have an extensive menu for those looking to avoid meat. I look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu. 4-starred review."}
{"text":"Love this place! It never disappoints. They usually have 3-4 vegan selections for me and that alone says a lot. The best way to describe a pasty (pah-stee, not paste-ee which are boobie tassels lol!) is a gourmet, flaky and perfect oversized pizza pocket. My fave is the mushroom, vegan mozz (daiya) and marinara sauce one. The Greek is also yummy! The ambience is way cool too. The large tables have church pews as seats! And every server and bartender is super nice."}
{"text":"The pasties are WAY too salty. For hours after, I could feel my tongue shriveling.  Still, the food is good and well-priced, the atmosphere is convivial, and there's a nice beer selection.    Gotta cut down on that salt, though.  Wow, did they overdo it."}
{"text":"First time eating here today but not first time visiting the many establishments located here in the greater Phoenix area as I have picked up for deliveries for doordash; which is what enticed me in the first place to finally try it after I got off my shift earlier today. Conveniently located here on University Street, has a great selection of vegetarian dishes which piqued my curiosity.  Low-key dimly lit pub atmosphere and all the staff wearing whatever they want, even if it had a huge hole in the pit of their sleeve.  Very bohemian,  dare i say hipsteresque. Coming from the bay area California i felt at home with all the avante garde styles, beards,  thick glasses and tattoos.  Started off with the Walnut mushrooms spinach soup, which was great to be dipped with the bread and butter.  Then I had the cheese & onion pastry which required no ketchup nor HP sauce, it was delicious enough as is and greatly paired with an IPA. Loved the rutabaga in it. Got too full before i could enjoy a third course.  Can't wait to come back soon and try their desserts and other savory selections with my friends."}
{"text":"My go to place when I'm craving some comfort food. Keep in mind that once you place your order (for a pasty) it'll take 15 minutes before it's ready. Something to remember if you were planning on coming here for lunch hour."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is in the Commercial Center Shopping Complex off Sahara, which in itself is a sketchy area (located near some fetish clubs, a swingers club and a men's bath house)...Went in here on a whim during lunch break. When I first walked in, there was only one other customer, some guy sitting at the bar, nursing a beer. Bartender (think his name was Liam???) immediately greeted me, asked me what he could get me to drink and presented me a menu. Liam (if that's his name) was super friendly, and took his time explaining all about the different kinds of Pastys' since I had never had one...his customer service couldn't have been any more wonderful. As time went by, the place started filling up pretty quickly and Liam (??) was on a roll, giving awesome customer service to all who came through the door as he was acting as bartender, server and cashier! When my pasty arrived, I was pleasantly surprised...toasty golden brown on the outside....I cut into it and it looked pretty great....I got the cottage pie pasty: beef, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc. It comes with some type of gravy to pour over it/dip into it...gravy was amazing. However, I was disappointed as I felt the beef was under seasoned. I also expected the pasty to be a little more light and flaky, like the top of a pot pie...but if that is how they originally are made then so be it.  Customer service: 5 stars Food: 3 stars (would have been 4 if the beef had been more seasoned)  Definitely will be back though to try some of the other pastys'!!!"}
{"text":"Noisy, not clean, weak service. There is no presentation effort in the service. There is a pasty on a metal plate. I will not return. The food is nothing more than a sub sandwich that is wrapped in dough and put in a quick oven. I can get that at Jimmie Johns with quicker, better service in a cleaner establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love to eat here.   They have 3 locations throughout the valley.  So if you like great food with a relaxed atmosphere.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"My friends raved about this place so I was really excited to try it. We all shared the different pasties that we each ordered and they were all flavorless and underwhelming. Was not a fan."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Coming here will be tradition every time I am in AZ!!! I love the food the ambiance and the service. The brews are outstanding.. Like holy shit.. Good."}
{"text":"I went to Arizona with some friends over the weekend, and a local recommended Cornish Pasty. It was so good that we went back the next day.   The servings are HUGE. Across the weekend I sampled the Pilgrim (thanksgiving in a pasty), the salmon one, the apple/caramel dessert, and pesto chicken. Everything was mindblowingly amazing. I really liked the dill sauce in the salmon, and the cranberry on the Pilgrim. I had the leek/potato/stilton soup as well, which was creamy and delicious as well.  I liked it so much that I started looking up the history of cornish pasties on Wikipedia. They're really good. I want to make my own, now.  The location is fairly tiny, so it's not good for groups."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit.  Very original.  Where I grew up in michigan they have pasty's.... these are better.  They are home made and really good.  I didn't look at the other reviews but I'm sure peeps be lovin these things.  I have to say the setting is a little dark for my taste but it is what it is!  Go have a pasty!"}
{"text":"Very filling and tasty with lots of pasty choices. The beer choices are good and service was good too. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"When I was still living in Tempe area. I never had a pasty before until my friend introduce me to this place. It definitely was an experience and the food was amazing. The place is always pack and has a very diverse crowd. I normally sit at the bar to see how the pasties were being made but then again they seem to be the only available seats when I go. The beer selections were great. I either get a strongbow or hoegaarden (both of which are my favorites). I've only had the oggie and lamb mint pasty. Lamb mint was by far my favorite and I'd always get that one. The lamb was cook just right, tender and still juicy. To top it off the red wine gravy was amazing! Now that I don't live in Az anymore I'm craving for it! Out searching here in NorCal and the bay area for a good place that serves pasty! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went to this place and was blown away by the service  and all the food.  Cool to watch them make the pastry.  Beer was awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always something new to try, good beers on tap. Not only the pasty selection but try the bread pudding!! We took my boyfriend's brother there recently and they did not disappoint. I will say I did have some trouble with the entrances and felt like a dork as soon as I realized I came in the wrong way but the hostess told me I wasn't the only one. I would highly recommend them. It's very dark and loud usually so be prepared but there are so many options and its veggie friendly, so they have options for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, kind of dark and subdued but totally works, once inside the staff is super helpful and friendly. If you like beer, well they have 20+ handles on tap. The food? The food you ask? AWESOME Cornish Patsy's of every flavor and type! Pork, chicken, beef, veggie, Mexican, Italian on and on and on.... Oh I'm not done, desert Patsy's !!! So FREAKING GOOD! You have to try this place! Great history of how Patsy's came to be, mining theme on the walls. Try it you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Come hungry because portions are huge but order a beer and relax while they prepare your food. It's not fast good, it's oven baked awesomeness. I had the Cajun Chicken, wife had the Italian. We were both very happy with our choices. I'll be coming back on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Had lunch today and it was awsome. My mom is from Plymouth and we used to eat pasties all the time. These are the best we have found. The sticky toffee pudding is one the best we evwr had."}
{"text":"WOW!  I come to the Phoenix area every once in a while on business.  This week I'm here for two days and decided to go out to lunch with a local friend of mine, and consulted Yelp for some advice.  The Cornish Pasty Company was shown as about a mile from my hotel, very good ratings, with a good beer selection... sounded like a great place!  We drove back and forth on University Avenue about five times before we found it!  Since the sign isn't visible from University it wasn't immediately obvious  where it was.  In fact, when we finally found the strip mall that the restaurant was in by matching the address, we STILL were scratching our heads as to where the restaurant was.  Finally I suggested we check around the corner and voila, we found it.  MAN OH MAN was the food delicous!  And Strongbow Cider on tap -- one of my favorites!  I wish I had discovered this place a couple of years ago when I had a long term assignment in Phoenix.  Now I'll only get to eat here a couple of times a year.  Boo!  I wonder how many meals at the Cornish Pasty Company I can fit into a 2-day visit??"}
{"text":"Sunday night for family fun and buck off beers. Makes comfort food comfortable again! Try the chips."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is chill and the food is great! Can't ask for better. My husband has The Pilgrim pasty while I had the Shepherd's Pie pasty. Both were outstanding. Definitely coming back in a future and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"When passing through Phoenix last week, we had dinner here on the recommendation of Yelp. Who knew you could get good British pasties in Tempe?  The pasties themselves were incredible. I had the bangers and mash, the wife had the chicken tikka masala. We loved each of them, and believe me that one pasty is enough to satisfy a big appetite.  We were not as huge fans of the fries/chips. Also, the waitress really had no idea about any of the beers on the menu. Since I am not knowledgable about British beer, this led me to order something I didn't really care for. Next time (oh yes, there will be a next time) I'll stick with the Lagunitas IPA."}
{"text":"Pasty's are great, even to go. Love the divey feel. People that work here are awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Greek pasty is the bomb dot com. A friend introeuced me and I am hooked. Thanks for cooking good pastys."}
{"text":"Love going here, literally at any time of the day! Always go and get a bottle and bite to eat with friends, atmosphere is the BEST. Staff is super cool and friendly."}
{"text":"It is some of the tastiest and most original food you will find in the area.  And also it is highly addictive, so be careful.  They have a well-developed vegetarian menu, and for those who eat meat there are even more choices.  I also love that there are a few dessert versions of the pasty as well, the bonoffee pie is mouth euphoria.  Quite a hipster place though, and seating is mostly only for parties of 2 or 3.  And also, don't expect to get top notch attentive service, because a lot of the servers will be busy just hanging out.  But the food basically makes up for all the bad."}
{"text":"I can definitely see why people come here for the pasties. The Chicken Tikka Masala pasty was tasty and I also ordered a cider which was good as well. While the food and drinks were great, the atmosphere could have been better and it was a bit too dark inside for my liking. Also this location seems to attract a lot of university students from ASU, so I may want to try another location to see how it compares."}
{"text":"Awesome! Saldly we waited 1 hour before food arrived to table but man it was delicious. Highly recommend the cottage pie. I'll be ordering ahead next time."}
{"text":"This chain needs to expand into Denver. They had Guinness on tap with 32oz mugs for only $8 and I got a Lamb Vindaloo pasty which was $11. I was in heaven for sure and went back the next day :o)"}
{"text":"Fave neighborhood spot in Tempe. If you're feeling comfort food and a hearty meal, do it! The food -- glorified hot pockets in the best way possible -- was traditionally prepared by Cornish miners and the restaurant atmosphere recreates that cave-like atmosphere. I absolutely love taking friends there when they're visiting...or just going there for beers or tea!"}
{"text":"I've been here with my boyfriend about six times. Cornish is the ish!! They have the best service delicious food and craft beer. You can't go wrong at Cornish."}
{"text":"Looking at the Yelp app, I found this gem among the long list of Thai and Chinese restaurants (all with great reviews) so I went in with high hopes.  And I gotta say, Cornish Pasty co. did not disappoint!  The restaurant is clean and comfortable and has a nice \"pub\" charm to it.  The bartender/waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly.  You can see right into the kitchen and watch the chef feverishly cooking meals to order.  Since it was my first visit, I decided to try the Oggie, the most traditional Pasty on the list, with a side of mushy peas and cole slaw.  I would have loved to try one of the 8 beers that they have on tap, or a bottle of banana bread beer with my food, but I was on lunch, so water it is .  My meal was fantastic!  Everything tasted fresh and came out piping hot, or nice and cold (slaw).  Each bite was flavorful but not over seasoned.  The meat filling was peppery and the crust was browned perfectly.  I had heard of mushy peas before but never had them.  They were tasty and colorful.  The slaw was slightly tangy and refreshing.  I'm very excited to show this place to my friends and family.  The only negatives I have to say about this place are that you shouldn't try to sit down and eat a Pasty if you have less than an hour for lunch.  Definitely get your food to go. (or call ahead maybe?)  you can't rush perfection.  And since you can see right into the kitchen, they should probably replace the ceiling tiles that have quite a bit of staining from smoke and grease.    I spent 18 dollars including tip, for lunch, which is a little pricey for me, so this can't be my new everyday hangout, but I'm glad to add it into rotation for some occasional tasty, casual dinners."}
{"text":"This is an interesting food experience where you get a lot to eat for a decent price.  The service was on top of things and took good care of keeping my drink full.  I ordered their original pasty and some baked beans with habenero peppers added and then got a lamb and mint pasty to go.  They carried out both orders very well and without the confusion many places seem to have when they receive such an order.  Good place for an occasional visit but regular visits might incur a larger waistline as it is a very carb heavy meal.  I enjoyed both of my pasty pies and would look forward to sampling their other offerings."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Gigantic draft beer menu and pasty options for every taste. I had a  Boddingtons and a Bangers and Mash pasty with mushy peas...soooooo Good! Super fun environment...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You must eat here. Of all of the places I've eaten in Vegas, this was the best. Only a 10 min drive from the strip and it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Ahh, pasties. No, not the nipple coverings, although those can be nice too (have you seen these ones? amazing! http://www.incrediblethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Grumpy-Cat-Pasties.jpg).  Anyway, this meal was a delightful taste and cultural experience, in the otherwise megacorporate sprawl wasteland of Arizona (what I saw of it anyway, I'm a Seattleite). Although I entered very reluctantly (it was phenomenally gorgeous out and this place is basically a cave), I was quickly pacified by the familiar surroundings... booze and dingy booths, my native habitat.   I'm a true pasty fancier, and the ones here are top-notch. If I ever mistakenly return to your city, I will gladly hide out at the CPC."}
{"text":"In Short: Good food and beer at a reasonable price, and a quirky atmosphere.  I've been there several times in the past year, and I must profess that peering into the place for the very first time, I was quite skeptical.  Restaurant has a an interesting design, reminiscent of a large hall way.  Once you walk in there's a bar to the left and booths to the right and the place had a friendly neighborhood vibe to it.  The menu is decent with a variety old old world and new pasties.  The staff was friendly and order taking was prompt.  Although it did take longer than anticipated to actually get food, but I imagine that's because they don't have things pre-made.  The food was quite flavorful and the proportions were adequate.  The stuffing was moist and the outside crust was just the right amount of crispiness.  I usually try out the pasty's with lamb and none have disappointed me so far.  Overall, a great place to have beer and pasties, I will visit again to try out their more curious concoctions."}
{"text":"Ok, so I just tried this place after reading all the good reviews.  Like someone mentioned before, the Lovely Bit O Salmon is awesome.  Of course I didn't get that, but my coworker did and it made me jealous!  I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken and although it was really good, it was nothing like the taste I had of the salmon pasty.  I will have to get that salmony creamy goodness next time.   These things will fill you up.  I felt like I needed a nap after my pasty lunch!"}
{"text":"My big group of friends and I stumbled upon this place randomly when we tried to go eat at Lotus of Sian (which was on the eaters 38 list)... This place, though, was not! Random location with blacked out doors. We were scared to walk in but one of our friends had been to another CPC before so we went inside. I've never had pasties, my boyfriend is from Detroit and has been exposed to them. They were amazing! they quickly got a table together to accommodate 12 people. Note, they don't usually have all this space available. The waitress so so sweet and recommended great dishes. She didn't seem annoyed at all that she had to wait on a table filled with drunk adults. The spicy chicken and bangers and mash were to die for. Everyone enjoyed all the food and all the beer selections that they had. Will recommend this place again and again for Vegas!"}
{"text":"I still have not been to the actual location. So this review is for the Catering service they provide.  I went to a Beautiful Outdoor Wedding this weekend. Cornish Pasty was the caterer. My girlfriend being an Ish is well familiar with this type of food, for me it was a first.  I have to say I really liked it. They did a great job serving it up. It was hot and very filling for sure. They had several choices for the Pasties. I chose the Steak and the Shepard Pie, both were very tasty. Teresa got the curry one which is was over the moon with. They also served a really good Salad ,the dressing was just right on it. As well and a Broc,cheese type vegtable side. Not bad at all. We will check out the shop soon, but for Catering they did a great job."}
{"text":"Used to love the pasty before I had to change my diet. Met some friends here recently (their choice) and I wish there were more gluten free options for those of us who can't eat their pasty dough - even a soup (using corn starch instead of flour) would do. The one thing on the menu I could order - the chicken tikka salad - is dry, flavorless and disappointing.  Cool building though! Patio is the hot commodity."}
{"text":"Love this place! food is excellent and they have good beer."}
{"text":"YUMM! I'm a vegetarian & I took my non-vegetarian friend to eat a veggie mexi which is mock beef & we were both super full and satisfied! The oven chips (fries)with garlic & jalapeños are also a must! The service is great & the waiters are all so kind. This is by far my favorite spot."}
{"text":"OK. Fourth time eating here, ordering the same thing every time, and I have to admit - the Oggie is a little salty. Not sure if it's a combination of the filling and the crust or just the filling, but every time I've noticed it more. Telltale sign is I end up drinking at least 5 glasses of liquid (i.e. water or beer) with my pasty, which is even more than I drink at an Indian buffet.  Alas! There *is* a significant difference between the Cornish Pasty Co.'s Oggie and the traditional Upper Peninsula of Michigan pasties I grew up with. The cut of the potatoes is completely different. The Oggie's potatoes are cut au gratin style. Most if not all U.P. pasties' potatoes are diced. The palatable truth comes out only after the ketchup has been slathered on, and you realize that you use far less ketchup when eating the Oggie versus a traditional U.P. pasty.   Still good though. The crust is superbly executed and the meat quality is fantastic. If you can get over the au gratin cut potatoes and the salt quotient, this is still a great effort. And, you're 2000 miles away from the American mecca of pasties... what are you gonna do?"}
{"text":"Great traditional English pub food.  Reminds me of my trip to Wales. Authentic and great tasting food."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat. Such a great menu and it's always fun talking your friends here because it is so different and fun!"}
{"text":"Found this place on our way to another pub and decided to stop in after seeing that there were 3 levels to choose from. I didn't even have time to check the Yelp reviews but the menu spoke for itself. Fabulous cocktails and an extensive menu. I had the \"Italian Cornish pastry\" and all I can say was \"wow\"! Very fresh and tasty. The drinks are strong and crafted beautifully. If you are looking for something better than typical Pub Fare then this is your place, it's comfort food in a place where you have three entirely different settings; al fresco, bar and romantic! All in one place. Very hard to find a concept like this and it be enjoyable. Service was great and if I'm ever in the Phoenix area again I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I eat here about 2-3 times a month, and at this point have had most of the menu.  Sometimes it gets very busy, and the service can be slow, but the food is great.  If you do takeout, I would suggest getting the pasty once-baked (IE not cooked through).  They seem to batch prep, then finish cooking to order.. if you order once-baked, you can finish it off in your oven at your discretion, which can be better.  They tend to have British punk music about 3-4 days a week, never really payed attention to which days are which for music.  The atmosphere is okay, but I prefer the feel of the Scottsdale and Mesa locations, this one is just the closest to me.  Some of my favorites include the Potato Leak Soup (best I've had anywhere), and the following pasties... The Mexican (vegetarian version is good too), Lamb Vindaloo (it's a little spicy), and the Carne Adovada.... I've haven't had anything that was outright bad, but the Royal had way more onion than I care for, and I also didn't care for The Italian either which was way too close to a calzone, but the difference in a pasty crust wasn't my taste.  All said, pretty much everyone can find something to like here... fair warning, it is definitely not a carb friendly menu.. there are a few salads which are good, but it's not their mainstay."}
{"text":"Everything was delcious! It's like a better version of crown & anchor. Ambiance is rustic wood and brick like a brewery, most pasties are about $10. The dishes are very savory - think comfort food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! The food is incredible. The restaurant is a hole in the wall and the dining room and staff look a little dark and scary but have no fear. You've found a true hidden treasure. My favorite pasty is the pilgrim but I've tried almost all of them and you will love em. Prices are really good you will be so happy you found this place. Go now you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"I think I'm in love.  My friends have been telling me about this place for months and I haven't had the opportunity to try it. Yesterday I finally did and my tummy has never been happier.  I love the ambiance of the place. It's very small, though they are working on an extension. The employees are all tattooed and rugged, which made me feel right at home. Motorhead, System of the Down, and other older rock and roll and metal music pumped through the speakers, making my ears nearly as happy as my stomach.  They have an extensive beer collection with different options from all over the world.  I had the portobello chicken pasty, and it was wonderful. The insides were so delicious and the crust was decadent. It was a lot of food, but I was determined to finish it.  I've heard this place gets super busy at peak hours and I'm not surprised. I am already looking forward to going back and trying another one of their delicious concoctions.  You can also buy their pasties uncooked so you can make them at home!"}
{"text":"this place has the worst service.   They are not welcoming or polite  and they don't seem like they want or need your business.   (This is for the 7th and Monroe downtown location)   I will never suggest anyone go there.   I spent a large amount of money there and they still had a  crappy attitude.    Aaron.. thank you for your response. I was there on March 1st.  I dont want to describe the girl that \"helped\" me here on this forum . I would rather send you a personal email"}
{"text":"Wow, I am impressed that this place has exceeded my expectations and changed my opinion of Cornish pasties. I've been to Cornwall 3 times and I wasn't that keen on all the Cornish pasties I have tried. I was like, I much rather have empanadas than pasties because they generally taste better. Although I was a bit skeptical at first, all the pasties I've tried here were all delicious and each of them had a great flavor! If you like artichokes, then you must try pesto chicken pasty! So good! And I highly recommend chicken tikka salad, cheap, healthy and delish!! The ambiance is cool and trendy, and I love the music that they play... Lots of good 80's British indie rock!! If you want to try pasties, don't go to Cornwall.... Just come here and you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I've long loved the Tempe location of Cornish Pasty. There, the service is awesome and the food is even better. That said, in four tries, I've never had a positive experience at the downtown Phoenix location. The first time, my order was incorrect. The second time, it took 20 minutes to be served drinks, and another 45 minutes to be served food. The third time, my order was incorrect again. Today, on my fourth visit for an early lunch, we ordered immediately -- a veggie tikka masala pasty and my usual, the Caesar salad with salmon. My boyfriend also ordered a draught IPA, and we were served at the bar. Our food took more than 50 minutes to arrive, without apology or explanation. It was delicious, as usual, but the kitchen at this location is clearly having a hard time making things work. What's more, for a little day drinking, the beer prices are dumb. $6.40 for a local IPA is pushing it, especially when this location doesn't offer the cheap beer options (Mickey's) that we all know and love from the Tempe location. Really hoping that this place can pull it together."}
{"text":"If you don't know where to go, come here!  They have amazing food! Everything is delicious! Some of my favs are the salmon pasty, the shepherds pie and bangers and mash. The divey bar in the back is so much fun and super chill! It is really dark, pbr candles, old leather comfy sofas and a pool table/darts. There is an oldschool TV with movies from the 90s....oh and there are cheap Irish car bomb drinks ...legit....I love this place!"}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed. The pasties  were so so. Not like they are in the U.P.   Service poor. :("}
{"text":"I decided to visit, persuaded by all the yelp reviews. This was my first time attending this facility.  I was immediately confronted to see if I needed help sitting or with a menu.   To make a long story short, all the positive Yelp reviews are spot on.  I had the Spicy Veggie Asiago and I nearly creamed myself with joy.    I am a picky m*ther fu*ker when it comes to my food, but I was very pleased in every aspect.  GO EAT HERE NOW!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. The tomato soup with croutons is a good start. I'm vegetarian and they have a lot of options even with fake meat. The greek pastry is my favorite. The atmosphere is really nice to spend some quality time with friends."}
{"text":"It took me four years after I moved here to try Cornish Pasty and I'm so glad I did! The restaurant has a huge selection of pastys and they have great beer. My husband and I usually share one cornish pasty and a side and I'm stuffed. They really have delicious flavors and they are super affordable.  They can get pretty crowded but I haven't ever had a problem eating at the bar. My only complaint is that the stools/counter are clearly meant for average/tall people and I'm so short it isn't very comfortable. Other than that, A+!"}
{"text":"If I were ever to be executed, I'd want a Meat & Cheese pasty for my last meal. With two red wine gravy.  It's *that* good."}
{"text":"Some friends recommended me to this place.  The bottom line is that if you are in the area and are hungry, you have to try this place at least once in your life.  It is an interesting bar setup inside and the hot-pockets/Pastys are so good. The portion size is pretty good too.  I was with a friend and we shared a few appetizers and one pasty and left pretty full."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place. It's flipping amazing! One of my favorite spots in town by far.  It's in a very.. interesting part of town. I still manage to find my way over every couple of months. My absolute favorite thing to order is the tomato soup. I am not a soup person, but this soup just does it for me. It's thick and creamy. It's topped with croutons that just float on top, and comes with a slice of fresh, thick-cut bread and butter. It's divine!  I'm pretty much in love with the Pilgrim. I have tried the Philly Cheesesteak and something else with Chicken, but the Pilgrim is my jam. It's loaded with chunks of juicy dark turkey meat, tender sweet potatoes and stuffing. It's comfort food at it's best.  I'm going to end this review - it's making me quite hungry. This place is an absolute must. Go now!"}
{"text":"I think people have a tendency to overrate this place because it is the only restaurant of its kind.  Don't get me wrong, the pasties are great, but there are a few reasons why this place isn't a four star restaurant:  1) It's overpriced.  You're paying almost 15 bucks for a lunch originally meant for miners. 2) It's cramped.  Good luck going there with more than one other person. 3) It's a little dingy.  Someone said the atmosphere is great.... Huh?  Not sure why a dark dining room that is six feet wide and crowded can be considered a nice atmosphere, unless maybe you grew up in a sewer.  Also, make sure you get there early if you want a table or food in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Great food and selection of beers. It's a nice place to grab dinner and a drink if you don't want the craziness of Mill. The service has been unfortunately a little uneven. Some of the waiters have even been outright rude. I wouldn't go with a group, because that's when they tend to get unhappy. It's a great option for 2-4 people."}
{"text":"So... are you closed? This is what we asked as we sat upstairs waiting for 15 minutes before anyone actually gave us any notice. We went downstairs to grab a cocktail and brought it upstairs to sit down. No hostess... No one even bothered to look over for 15 minutes. It wasn't until we actually stop someone walking by for the fifth time to ask if they were closed that the waitress said oh... \"Well you had drinks so we figured you were served at the bar.\" Yes we were served at the bar but not offered any menus so we came upstairs for food. we were told... Yeah you have to ask for menus. Is this the new age of dining? I really hope not.  If you go to Cornish pasty eat before you arrive, only come for drinks and go downstairs. More than likely, that's the only place you will get served."}
{"text":"Oh man. So many choices, so little room in my stomach. I tried both the cottage pie pasty and the chicken pot pie pasty. Out of this world! The pastry shell is so delicate and tasty. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband works on this side of town and i visit him for lunch every once in a while. Knowing that I pretty much love all things pastry, he recommended this place (which I know was hard for him considering lotus is in the same shopping center and he loves that place, but I'm not too big a fan of thai) I didn't know what to expect but I did think they would probably have good deserts. We shared a savory pasty (bangers and mash) and it was delicious!! For desert, we got the apple pasty and it was also delicious... Served with ice cream. Now that I think about it, I want to go back now... Definitely a nice gem in vegas!"}
{"text":"The Pasties are fantastic. Deserts are great big enough to share. Definitely a college hangout, but I remembered the louder 70's 80's 90's rock music."}
{"text":"Menu has tons of different choices, and every single one looks good! Good beer specials, and interesting servers... fun atmosphere too"}
{"text":"This is perfect for me. Dark and cave-like. Always good music on. Weird dude talking to himself making pasties. Beautiful bartenders that humor me when I draw pentagrams on my receipts and pout. Also they have craft beers on tap, not a million, but enough to keep me coming here nearly every weekend. I don't even feel like I'm in commercial center anymore. Even though the pasties are so rich and delicious sometimes I come here for beer and dessert only. I usually split a pasty with my husband and am very full after. The desserts are only $6 and are so good.  These are the best pasties:  The Royale- Flaky, buttery crust holds the contents of a burger, complete with patty cooked to your liking and actual French fries inside there. I recommend enjoying this with BBQ sauce and thousand island.  The Ruben- All my friends know that I love rubens. This is no exception. The experience is surrealistic and spiritual so I don't really have words for it. Must have thousand island with it.   Here are more of my favorites:  Cream of Leek Soup- thick, rich, and salty. The potatoes are soft. This is true comfort food. The bread and butter are fresh too. I used to fill up on this and beer.  Mushroom Walnut Soup- Also thick. It's nutty and savory. I think this is my favorite soup here. Also served with fresh bread and butter.   Oven Chips with Garlic and Jalapeno- No joke this is good. I love that I can tell that these fries were potatoes. I usually share this and a pasty with my husband and we get super full.   Banoffee- Want to make a chef scream to the heavens in frustration? Order this. As much as I feel bad it's worth it because this giant dessert is superlative. You can share it with 4 people. The bottom is a thick gram cracker crust. Then it's covered in legit caramel sauce- THICK. On top of that is fresh whipped cream. Then it's topped with sliced bananas and sauce. The caramel middle is pure witchcraft.  Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding- I swear this is like eating a crunchy brownie soaked in some kind of sweet liquor chocolate sauce. I get mine with ice cream because it is so rich. It's so hard to share this one because it is truly amazing."}
{"text":"Oggie! Oggie! Oggie!  Oi! Oi! Oi! Yup - had to order the Oggie - the basic steak and potatoes (with onion and rutabaga) pastie.  This tasted like growing up in the midwest in the 60s/70s - salt, pepper, beef, potatoes, onions, and some 'exotic' red wine gravy.  Nice bit of time travel during  lunch.  This was a hearty meal, and I enjoyed it.  The restaurant is cool looking - lots of trestle tables where you can sit with a big group of friends, or join some not-yet-friends who are already there.  Indoor/outdoor bar (wrong time of year for the outdoor part, but good to bear in mind for when the weather gets back to perfect)."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this one for some time now and what better way is there to experience St. Patty's Day than at a British pub? tee heehe... I didn't really go there for that specific intention, just wanted to try a pasty and it happened to be St. Patty's. Any who, I was surprised to find that it was a hangout spot with a stage in the back, a full bar on either side of the restaurant, and a pool table area. It was quite packed when I arrived, and it smelled wonderful. The atmosphere is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but it was definitely my kinda vibe. There is a much quieter area close to the entrance for those that don't want to be apart of the crowd. They had tons of brews on tap, but they ran out of most of the traditional Irish beer that night.   The main highlight are the pasties. We ordered the Carne Adovada and the Guinness Stew Pasties along with the Scotch egg and a Tikka Chicken salad. These delightful pockets are quite filling yet not \"doughy\" so the crust is quite thin but still holds everything together. I cannot say enough about the fillings...full of flavor and the meat so tender! They also come with special sauce/sour cream on the side, but it's not really necessary. The Scotch egg was rather small since it's just one, but is definitely worth it. I was not too crazy about the salad and thought it lacked a bit in flavor, but it was still very fresh. I will most definitely be back to this place, possibly with a bigger group so we can play pool and darts! They also have live music which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was an overall good experience. The atmosphere is a little different - very dark and trendy. Good music. Ample indoor and outdoor seating. Service was little slow (it was a weeknight, around 9:00 PM) throughout the dining experience. I really enjoyed the mushroom soup - it was excellent and also liked the chicken pot pie pasty. The bread - this is the deal breaker - the most amazing bread ever! You have to have it! Despite the service, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved the leek and potato soup despite the 90 degree temps outside this weekend. The soup was so flavorful and loaded with the veggies and the lovely soft bread and butter accompanying it would have certainly been enough for my dinner.....but no, I had to order a spicy chicken pasty also, too much for one gal to eat!  My authentic English colonial boyfriend enjoyed the lamb vindaloo pasty.  Nice and spicy!  We will be back the next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There are few restaurants I can remember in the valley that had more buildup, more anticipation, more frustration, and more confusion than when Dean Thomas decided to open his fourth valley Cornish Pasty location in Downtown Phoenix.  What started out as universal excitement soon turned into a years long nightmare for Thomas and a long confusing wait for Downtown patrons.  Dean was determined to make his Downtown Phoenix location the biggest and best in the chain and bought out a huge three story space on Central & Monroe back in 2010 to prove it.  But the more they renovated, the more problems they encountered (including having to rebuild all the building utilities from scratch).  Thomas was constantly forced to move back opening date due to all the calamities (and the escalating costs).  Seven years after Dean got the keys to the space, Cornish Pasty finally opened in Spring 2017.  Having been to Dean's restaurants in Tempe and Scottsdale, I was joyous.  For today's Saturday lunch, it was time to give the new place a spin.  Located directly across the street from Seamus McCaffrey's, Cornish Pasty's newest location evokes many of the familiar vibes you've probably encountered at their other locations, but with a larger and arguably more energetic vibe.  The basement floor in particular reminded me of Pasty's Tempe location with its darkly lit room, dark trimmed booths, and wooden accents.  The top floor is also somewhat dimly lit with wooden furniture all around, but with almost a sports bar feel with pool tables and its own separate bar.  And then of course there's the ground level, reminding me a lot of their Scottsdale location with patio seating out front and bar area seating that looks out over the kitchen.  At max capacity I'd guess the new Pasty can seat between 150-200 people.  A couple friends and I were able to get seating upstairs right away during today, but it was still an almost full house.  There are three main reasons why all the Pasty locations get 4.5 stars on Yelp.  For one, Pasty has an abundant beer selection on tap (typically a couple dozen) and there are usually multiple bar areas so as to serve patrons quickly (the Downtown location has three separate tap stations).  Another reason?  The pasties of course.  A wide array of foods stuffed into a pastry dough then cooked until the dough is hot and flaky and the ingredients inside are warm and stick to your ribs.  The third reason Pasty is so popular?  The prices.  The original location in Tempe opened with the idea of gaining traction with the legions of poor starving ASU students, and today you can still get a full sized pasty and a beer for $20 or less.  As this was my first meal at the new location, I decided to do a throwback to my first visit at the Tempe location.  I ordered the same thing I ordered all those years ago in Tempe.  A glass of Hoegaarden White Ale and a whole Chicken Pot Pie Pasty.  Total cost including tax and tip came to about $22.  The pasties may not look like a lot of food when you first order them, but there's pretty much no way you'll leave hungry if you have a whole one.  In fact most people I've dined with are good after a half pasty.  Me?  Well I couldn't help myself to all the chicken, carrots, green beans, red potatoes, celery, rosemary, and onion.  Oh and of course the gravy that comes on the side.  Hearty, old school, and pure.  I would say my favorite pasty of theirs to date has been their Carne Adovada, but I'm also a fan of about a half dozen other ones too (including a few of their dessert pasties).  In any event, you get the picture.  Good hearty food and beer for a reasonable price in a space that has many personalities.   The Downtown location fits perfectly into the neighborhood, offering a lengthy menu of delicious pasty concoctions sure to appeal to just about anyone.  Happy hour and late night will no doubt be epic here with a mix of Downtown college students, Downtown workers, and Downtown visitors likely filling up all three floors.  It was a cartoonishly long wait for the doors to open.  But Dean and his staff have made certain Pasty's newest location lived up to his dream, making the wait completely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a classic for the area. Basically fancy hot pockets. :) I've slowly been making my way through the entire menu of pasties that they have and they have all been fantastic. The Royale w/ Cheese and the Italian are great places to start. Good selection of beers and priced reasonably. Hit up this place if you want really good quick food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been in twice and both times it was top notch. Great food, big selection, good beer, good deserts. Nothing to complain about besides maybe the wait for a table at times.   I've had the tikka masala, original, and Mexican chicken. All very good."}
{"text":"Fun place with a cool vibe. The food is always on point and the service is almost always great. Only negative is that the beer is pricey"}
{"text":"The food and service was GREAT - we will for sure return, would give it 5 stars, but the front door sucks!   Oh and staff purses are right there in open site by the front door! ....not good."}
{"text":"I went to the smaller version that opened up on mill. It was my first time. I loved it. Cheap beer and delicious pasties. I'll be back very soon"}
{"text":"came to pasty once, basically fell in love. bill made me the best sour drink of my life (muddled cucumber, whiskey, prolly jesus' semen). he's hot. he sings. he fucks. he's your new favorite bartender. if anyone gets his number i'll buy you a drink for it. cornish pasty boiz got that wagon"}
{"text":"This place is the gosh darned bomb.  The food here is so crazy good I can't even begin to describe it.  To boot, they have Strongbow cider on tap, happy hour daily from  3 to 6, and the most unbelievable pasties we've had outside of Truro, Cornwall.  And that's not even mentioning the Shirley Temple pudding.....The food is rib-sticking and makes you feel like you are lying down on a soft couch and blanket when you eat it.  There is a type of pasty for everyone here, so don't read any more.  Just go.  In the entire valley, this is our 2nd favorite place (the first being a local pizza joint, Palermo's.)  The kids working at the place might be a bit young, brash, and stoner-looking, but the owners and recipes are faultless.  We have been here avout 20 times in the last 2 years, and every time the experience is the same.  Go.  Now."}
{"text":"Bomb I love this place , the shepherds pie one with the red wine gravy was amazing , I will go back time and time again for that , flaky crust , tasty inside , great dipping sauce , omg I'm getting hungry just talking about it lol"}
{"text":"I was headed to another restaurant when I saw this one and immediately decided I was going to try it. The atmosphere was great, an old world feel- the decor and set up was truly unique. I went upstairs to find more seating and 2 pool stables. I couldn't decide what I wanted to try (the pasties all looked so good) so I got 1 and my brother got one and we split them. They both were amazing- the Ruben and the Carne Adovada (was a bit spicy but I love spicy foods). The crust was thin and crispy and the fillings tasted homemade. They also had some craft beers, I didn't have one but my brother had an IPA and said it was really good. If we weren't at an event I would have brought one home-- you can get it half baked to finish cooking at home. I believe if you get the Oggie you even get a small discount if it's take and bake. Overall I loved this place and will have to find a reason to go back downtown just so I can eat here."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty damn good food, it's different than anything else out there, and it's definitely worth going back, but I gave this place a few tries and I think it could use a little something.  Specifically, both times I visited, I didn't like the dirty countertop (sticky, yuck!) or the dirty wine glasses hanging in front of me. And I didn't like having to either speak up or wait an extra ten minutes every time I wanted to order, get my check, or get my change on each visit. I even see people acknowledge the shitty service in their 5-star reviews and I don't quite get it.  It was damn tasty though."}
{"text":"A friend suggested that we try out this place for lunch on 2/11/14 and what an experience it was. I first want to say what GREAT customer service we received! The waitress ( sorry I don't remember her name but she was a red head) was a delight. She knew the menu and very helpful when it came to deciding what to try as this was our first time here. We had the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup with fresh baked bread. This soup was so good I went back after work and got a bowl to take home for my daughter to try. I had the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pastie and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie, both were delicious. I took a cup of the mushroom soup to a co-worker that could not stop raving about how good the soup when I saw her the following day. This place is in the commercial center but don't let that stop you from giving this place a try. We will now make this a regular place that we visit especially since I have to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Not the best soft opening I've been to. Everyone was frazzled. We ordered two scotch eggs but they only had one left :( and wasn't particularly good. It took about 15 min and three different people to confirm there was a vegan pasty available though the menu said there would always be two options and none of the dessert ones we wanted were available. Everyone in our party thought the food was overly salty, including the mushy peas. The service wasn't great, but forgivable since he was brand new and was trying so very hard to please us with a great attitude while being completely lost. I hope they can improve over time. I would try it again maybe after giving them a few more months."}
{"text":"Authentic British pub with over-the-top food. The best pastie I've had in the States."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM, I love this place! The atmosphere is awesome, the service is great, and the food is the best aspect of it all. I liked the fact that you feel as if you are in an English pub. My server was super friendly and gave great advise to picking a pasty. There are tons of options here and it is perfect for vegetarians too! I go out to eat with my mother frequently and we are always in pursuit for great vegetarian options in the valley. This is the perfect place to take your vegetarian friend even if you love meat because their are so many options for both.   The only thing I can compare this to for those who haven't tried it is a more delicate calzone without the excess cheese, if you like calzones you will love Cornish Pasty. This restaurant takes pride in their food and it shows. Stop by I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"During a recent stay in the area we were walking around looking for a place to try for a beer and some food. The name caught my eye and we decided to give it a try (especially after noticing Guinness on tap). It seems like it would be a small place judging from the outside but there is seating up stairs, down stairs, on the main level, and outside. We found a place right by the doors which turned out to be perfect.  The menu is amazing with so many great options. They even have a couple vegan options and various vegetarian dishes as well. Husband tried the Italian and I tried the Lamb and Mint. They were so good and full of flavor.  I wanted to try the PB&J dessert, but was too full. Next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Not sure how or why people like this food. It's plain awful. Seriously overpriced and under seasoned hot pockets. Mediocre selection of beer."}
{"text":"One star because the food was good.  Everything else about this dining experience was appallingly bad.  I never been treated with such outright rudeness and disrespect.  Today my coworker excitedly invited a group of us from the office to eat at this restaurant as it WAS her favorite place.  We went on our lunch break.  She called the order in ahead to make sure we had time to eat and make it back to the office.  When we got there my coworkwer was told upon entry that her pasty was given away but they'd make another.  We all sat and ate but my friend's food never came.  After 3 attempts to find out what the hold up was with my friends order, and getting snapish and obviously irate responses, we finally found out her order was given to another table. No apologies. We had to practally beg to get that answer.  The nasty waitress with the short hair and the blonde with the ponytail had the ugliest attitudes. End result, my friend got a pasty which belonged to someone else.  The bartender paid for it. I explained to him that due to their neglect, my friend will have to go hungry until she gets off work at 5pm.  He said \"we're busy and short staffed\" he was very unsympathetic. But after my friend started taking names, he became nice and showed some humanity before we left.  The other 2 women, did not. They got worse. I heard them talking about us to the other customers.  I ignored it.  But i heard the horrible blonde say \"those fucking office workers\" as we were leaving. My other friend turned to her and said \"you know, the food here is good but the service is terrible\" To this, they did not respond. This experience was very hurtful because their hostility was completely unprovoked.  The girl who invited us all was so embarrassed. She kept apologizing and we were let down.  We were going to invite friends and family but instead we will spread the word.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE.  THEY WILL TREAT YOU LIKE GARBAGE!  I've never had a pasty before. I'll be trying other places from now on. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Although I won't be given a 5 star review, I would easily say that the Cornish Pasty in it's own special way fits in my top 3 restaurants I've been too in Phoenix.  I had never tasted pasties before until meeting my girlfriend and had doubts as to the potential quality of \"British\" food but I was truly blown away and have always left happy and never dissatisfied with my meal. It's hard to not stick to your favorites (the pesto chicken) I've personally also enjoyed the Shepherd's pie and chicken Alfredo as well. They also have a decent list of import beers which caps off the experience.  Meal aside though, in terms of the complete experience, meal, atmosphere, waiters,etc, that is were it loses it's one star. First off the location isn't very big...and they only have one location (this is a positive...but at the same time, just like Pita Jungle, with it's many locations and consistent quality, I would love to see another one arrive and I know this is the case soon). Secondly, and it's nearly impossible to avoid due to the size of the restaurant and the proximity to the kitchen, the place can get a bit hot and stuffy. But otherwise, whether a resident or a visitor wanting to try a \"recommended\" place, I would put my money on Cornish Pasty for a very delicious and filling meal."}
{"text":"Wow, I am a convert!  The pasties are amazing.  I highly recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty.  It was so tasty!  Their menu looks really good, and I look forward to coming back to try more.    Our server Stephanie was great!  Service was really fast.  This is a great place to grab a beer too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the new location!  Same great food as always, but so much more room! park across the street in the Arts Factory."}
{"text":"when I came it  was  hard to tell if it was open or not. the store front is a bit out of the way. it is alot smaller then I thought it would be. its about two tables wide (with the bar in that size). so about 5-6 tables in all and very loud in there I did not see any tv(was not really looking but the music was blasting.    I found this place by looking up vegetarian restaurant for my girl friend.  they have a look of good picks for vegetarians.  I had the Lamb/Mint pasties. I like lamb but it can be hard to cook at times. this has to be some of the best cook lamb I have had and the pasties are light and buttery.   also got the side of \"chips\" (fry's for us in the usa) they where ok but I would not order them again. still may try the curry potato but I really like curry. they also part cooked some pasties to go so I could bring it home to some one else (seems like they would do that for anything on the menu. says to cook it at 425 for 15-20 mins.  I know I will be back here in two week or so to try something else for sure."}
{"text":"Was in to Cornish Pasty today and the meatball appetizers were half the size they were a month ago. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"im giving this place 3 stars because they have a great beer selection and carbombs are always $3.00.  super good deal right there.  im not giving this place 5 stars because every time i have stopped by for some food it has been very bland.  i have tried 3 different pasties and none of them had any flavor...not even after soaking them in the red wine gravy. another thing that bugs me is now that they have expanded the building it can be some what hard to get your bartenders attention...even when they are slow...BUT...when you do get their attention the drinks are good.....and the carbombs are stellar. will i be back???? of course...but to drink....and not eat....unless i drank too much....."}
{"text":"A pub with very good food.  As the name implies, their specialty is pastys (basically the British version of an empanada).  I ordered the scotch egg and the Shepherd's pie pasty.  The scotch egg came with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  Tasty if unorthodox concept on this side of the pond.  Then I had the Shepherds pie pasty.  Imagine a shephers pie (stewed lamb, peas, carrots and mashed potatoes)in a pastey shell with brown gravy on the side.  Very tasty and much more portable.  Prices were good too!  The scotch egg plus Shepherd's pie pasty plus a pint of Guiness came to $22 with tip included."}
{"text":"Want to know a secret? I had no idea what a \"pasty\" was. I though it was maybe someone's aunt or something. I had no idea it was a pocket of magic.   First thing I did was ask for a gallon of water. Our server was very obliging and made sure my cup did not go dry. He said, \"you either ran here or you're hungover.\" Well in fact sir, despite it being nearly 7 pm, I was extremely hungover. (thanks to Devil's Advocate)   I wasn't sure I could hold food down, but once I was delivered my portabella pasty it was no longer a question. It was going in my mouth. Whether or not it would last in stomach, I would wait to find out.  It turns out, a pasty is just what it takes to help out a hangover. Whatever that magical pocket it made of is just what I needed. No doubt the bucket of water helped, too.  Bonus, they have some pretty hearty options for when you're hungry/hungover/etc. and some healthy vegan and vegetarian options for when you're in the mood for something lighter. Oh, and $3 carbombs that I politely declined as I grimaced and grabbed my stomach."}
{"text":"This place is near my work so I have come here quite a few times for lunch.  Since it takes about 25 minutes for your pasty to be made I call ahead and tell them what I would like and then it is ready when I get there.  Just a tip for those who do not have a lot of time at lunch.  They also have the option to order them half-baked so you can pick them up on your way home from work and complete the baking at home to have them for dinner.   This place has awesome tasty pasties and they are very affordable need I say more?"}
{"text":"Great food don't waste your time with ordering takeout or if there busy 2nd time I was given an attitude by a tattooed pierced wanna be methhead.  Unfortunately there are no managers or adults in charge shame  this place would be amazing if not for a few visibly unhappy waiters especially if you wander into the bar area !   If the owners cared they would take my advice. Nothing is worse then placing an order with someone that feels life owes them a living.  You have an amazing product need to be represented by employees that care and not the fools you have now !"}
{"text":"This is some of the best food in Tempe.  I didn't find this place until I had lived in the area for 3 years.  I wish I knew about it sooner, because I only got about 6 months of this before I had to move.  The recipes are great and they are very vegetarian friendly.  The dessert ones are great, and the drink specials are awesome too.  Always cheap irish car bombs."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and easy to find. The food was amazing and such a wide variety. Definitely come hungry."}
{"text":"Came here because this restaurant got the most reviews in Tempe.  The baked pastries were good.  The Cajun chicken and pasta salad were too salty.  The pilgrim baked pastry was better (basically baked turkey dinner). The mushroom and leek soup were tasty.  The atmosphere is loud and dark, and great for beer and a one pound pastry filler."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. Three of us went in and all left happily full with delicious pasties. Personally, I had the bangers and mash pasty and it was very excellent. Don't let the hole in the wall feel spook you. Leave the beaten path, save some money while in Vegas, and get some stellar food!"}
{"text":"Things to know about the pasty:  #1. It's pronounced \"PAST-ee\", not \"PASTE-ee\". One you eat; the other taunts you. #2. It's meant to be filling because the damn thing was invented for miners and as such, was never intended to be served with gravy.  Things to know about the establishment itself:  #1. It's dark inside for a reason - to mimic a mine, where the pasty was standard fare back in Britain, not because they're trying to be hipsters. The clientele does that. #2. The patio is smoker and pet friendly. Inside, the long tables and bench seats aren't particularly convenient for anyone with long legs or a rubenesque shape.  Review:  Tried the Oggie for myself and a Porky for the little lady. She got a cup of the potato and leek soup and loved it. But with the full slice of bread it is served with, she couldn't eat the entire pasty herself. Both were quite delish, however.  I was disappointed that the ONE beer (Hefeweizen) I was longing for out of the many fine selections on tap was \"out\". But, our waitress recommended I try a Hoegaarden instead. I requested a slice of orange added for good measure and found it to be an acceptable balance to the Oggie's heaviness.  Honestly, I come from Wisconsin near the U.P. of Michigan and am partial to their style of pasty up in the Yoop. Not that what I had wasn't tasty, but the red wine gravy was a -- shall I say, unusual? -- flavor accompaniment. It's just a personal bias of mine.  Anyone who has never had a pasty before will enjoy any selection on the menu."}
{"text":"So overall great place.. The decor is pretty neat it's dark inside with the windows covered and closed. The furniture was dark woods and just cool. Almost like entering another world.   It wasn't busy we went and sat ourselves. The waiter was patient and let us look through the menu. The Pasty I got was a Chicken Alfredo and Hubs got Spicy Cajun. Both of which are good. I never take food home but this one I am taking home.   Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty serves up a British classic in a pub-like environment in a weird part of Tempe. The tables are long, the lighting is dim, and the pasties are heavy. And look, I'm not advocating you slap a constantly illuminating \"Open\" sign on the front of this restaurant, but its position on the side of a strip mall made it hard to find!   Cornish Pasty had a ton of vegetarian options. Most of them had Quorn fake meat. If you've ever looked hard enough, you'll find Quorn at your local Kroger, or definitely at a Whole Foods. Just substituting meat with Quorn works quite well.  If you're up for eating a $10 Hot-Pocket-on-steroids, go to Cornish Pasty Company.   The veggie BBQ Spicy Chicken pasty was fun to eat. The homemade BBQ sauce was tangy, and the jalapeno and red onion stood out. I also ended up ordering a cheese plate and bowl of broccoli soup. I ate the soup too quickly and burned my tongue. What a disaster. The cheese plate was fine. The flavors were strong - sharp and or stinky was the name of the game. The plate came with pieces of toast, which was a lot of bread. But hey, in this pub-like environment, bread can be a good thing.   If I end my health kick, I'll definitely swing back by and try a different pasty."}
{"text":"I went to Cornish Pasty to meet family for dinner and had no clue what I had been missing! The location is sketchy and the restaurant (pub) itself is not fancy and a little dingy. BUT, the food is amazing! The Royal Pasty (Cheeseburger) is fab! I even went back to get a to-go order after my first visit. They are big enough to share. I think I may have heard the manager/owner saying they were moving to a better location when I was there last week???!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and chillaxin...  Pasties take a while to prep and cook so be patient...it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going here for years! I could eat Cornish every day.   Everything I've had here is delicious (and I've had almost every pasty from the Vegetarian menu, the salmon pasty, and almost every dessert). Do yourself a favor and explore the entire menu... try everything! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"The original hot pocket, a pasty is IMO a better version of the other tries (calzone, empanada, etc...) The meat and Cheese, Lamb vindaloo, lamb and mint...OK, all of them are good!! Oh, and beer on tap, the only thing they have too much of on tap is hipsters....seriously, skinny jeans, plaid shirts, a beanie and beard in 110 degree heat screams retarded, not cool."}
{"text":"I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(  But nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.)   Soups: They offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.    Sides:  The garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.    The mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.    The broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had.   All their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.    What differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.  Overall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I had myself my first Cornish Pasty the other night!  My hubby and I picked them up, so this review is plain and simple...for the food.    I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken with spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes.  It was fantastic!  Still piping hot by the time we opened them up to devour them.    Definitely a fan and can't wait to come and dine in sometime soon.  There are quite a few pasties I'm eyeballing on their menu...I love all the choices!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! The food here is great!  I really enjoyed the Beer as well as the great ambiance."}
{"text":"I really don't get what the big deal is about with this place. I went after reading all the rave reviews by other Yelpers last evening before heading to Gammage to see Wicked. For the first time, I went to a Yelp-recommended place and was very disappointed.   First of all, the place is a dump. It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar.   I'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.    The food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value.   Our server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons/employees who were hanging around.   If I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit. This one is just not worth the drive from the West Valley."}
{"text":"Stumble upon this unique establishment while looking for the old downtown deli. Sadly the Deli is sold to Tavern Deli so I met my fiancé at Cornish Pastry around the corner. I'm so glad we did new experience and I loved it. I had the Roast Dinner with pot roast, roasted Brussels sprouts and carrots and rutabaga etc...  in a flakey delish pastry. Served with side creamy horseradish. My fiancé got the Cajun Chicken both very good! And I like the environment and I say up stairs overlooking the kitchen where you can watch them prepare the delicious filled pastries. A must try!  Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Remember that scene in Twilight when the Cullens first walked in the cafeteria and were essentially \"introduced\" to the audience?  That's how I felt when we (8 obnoxious, out-of-place, mob of hungry/alcohol feening Asian girls from So Cal) stormed in this low-key restaurant.  Yup, exactly like that, just totally different.  Cliffs notes:  Food:  4 STARS Dessert: 4 STARS Service:  3 STARS Price:  $8-9  The key here is the pastry.  The filling is really just the vehicle to the warm, puff pastry.  I personally ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, which IMO  probably was one of the few that didn't belong in a pastry.  The potato inside a pastry just doesn't go too well with me.  Luckily, I had 7 other girlfriends to free-load...err sample from.  The Mexican one was probably my favorite.    Also worth noting is the Apple Pastry topped with Ice Cream.  Warm yummy pastry and ice cream combined?  Simple, but yummie nonetheless.  Finally...come here during HH if you could.  $3.00 Irish Car Bombs.  Done."}
{"text":"I like their cornish pasty but the problem don't be in rush, the food is really worth the wait ... good size salad"}
{"text":"The decor at this location is rustic, urban, and hip.  The food was quick and absolutely top notch."}
{"text":"Service was remarkable! This place is just totally incredible all around! OH! They also just  updated their sound system and it is KILLER! It's so great it sounds live."}
{"text":"What a treasure this place is. The Pasty is easy; they take amazing stuff and cook it in pastry dough. There's a big, big menu, and it's easy to pick what you will like. There's enough detail in the description that if you like the filling, you'll like the pasty.   Great bar and lots nice salads and apps. Try the oven chips.   Sit at the near end of the bar and watch them make these pockets. Amazing."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was TERRIBLE and its safe to say myself nor any of my coworkers will ever dine here again. 15 coworkers and myself decided to have lunch here this past Friday. We called our order in 1 hour ahead of time to ensure we were able to get back to work on time. We had 1 1/2. When we placed our order we advised we were on lunch and our time frame, and even provided a contact number just in case they needed it for ANY reason. When we got there RJ  explained they were out of the item I ordered. He apologized and advised my new order would be put in immediately so its ready when all my other co workers food was ready. All 15 of them were served and at least 15 minutes went by, and RJ still had not come back to our table, so I stopped another waitress Karla, and asked about my order. Excuse my language but she was a total bitch about it. She stopped me in the middle of my explanation and said, \" I dont have anything to do with your order, talk to RJ and walked away. Another waitress passes and one of my co workers stopped her (Dylan). She went to checked with the cook, came back and said it would be ready in a few. Another 7 minutes or so went by, and now every single person I am with was completely done and ready to cover their check. Karla walkes past again and another coworker stopped her and asked her what was going on. Now we were all upset attempting to explain the situation and how my food has still not come. She didn't even have the decency to offer an apologize. After checking on the order,  she said my order  had been giving to another table. After all this we were leaving and one of the woman waitress said \"I have Fucking work people\" .... NEVER AGAIN......"}
{"text":"I had the bangers and mash.  Delish!  The pastry on the pasty was perfect.  I could eat just the pastry and be happy.  The fact that the inside was just as good was a bonus!  For those of you who don't like spicy food, this was not; just well-seasoned and flavorful.  Looking forward to trying their new location in downtown."}
{"text":"All of the pasty I have tried so far have been amazing. Buttery and flaky on the outside, and savory on the inside. The portobello mushroom pasty definitely has to be my favorite. Not only do they a have great food, but their dessert is a must try as well."}
{"text":"Every item on the menu is delicious! They have a great selection of beers & they're priced just right.  From appetizers to desserts, you can't go wrong. Friendly staff that makes you feel at home. This has become one of our favorite local spots - perfect for takeout too,"}
{"text":"\"Cozy\" pub atmosphere, great food, easy on the wallet.  I had the bangers and mash pasty, she had the cottage pie pasty, we were both in heaven. Took a dessert home to share. Server was helpful and very nice. My only minor issue was that we came out smelling like we worked in the kitchen--lots of ambient cooking aromas."}
{"text":"The service and the heat knock this place down a star...not having A/C in AZ just seems like a horrible, horrible idea, especially in such a small space, with no waiting area, and tons of bodies packed in.   Our server (after our 25 minute scorching wait) was very nice, and kept our drinks filled...but took 30 minutes post-finishing to bring us the bill, and just as long to pick it back up with the cards...all the while, I was schvitzing and sweating.  That said, the food is freaking amazing. I had the Mushroom, Spinach, Walnut Soup, while my co-diners enjoyed the Leek soup - both were lick the bowl clean, as was the bread served with the soup. I appreciated at barrage of vegetarian Pasty options, both more with veggies (like the delicious balsamic portobello I had) as well as with faux meat, Quorn brand (yum!). My friends had the bangers and mash and the chicken greek pasties, and both were beyond satisfied. One took an order of Shirley Temple Pudding home -- if I wasn't visiting from out of town, I would have too - it smelled godly.  Would suggest visiting during an off hour, as there are no seats for waiting, and it is ridiculously hot. Plus, make sure you have lots of time for freshly made food, and medium speed service. Food is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets.  Food, staff, owner and beer is amazing.  I'm here as often as I can.  If someone is reading this and has never been to this place, trust us here, this place is amazing.  I had a buddy in town from Los Angeles a few months ago and he's a food and beer snob...we walked into this place and as we sat down at the bar he commented \"you know that it's nearly impossible for this place to meet the expectation you have set by running your mouth about it, right?\".  Within 10 minutes, he looked at me and said \"damn you, I get it, this is a f'ing great place\"."}
{"text":"They are doing something different in Vegas.  Liked this place and it fits in well downtown.  Affordable and overall good service.  Parking limited."}
{"text":"I work very close to this place, so when the name popped up I was instantly intrigued. Not to mention the fact that they only serve huge hot pockets. Double the interest. I walked in to a cute waitress with a smile and hot red hair, sold before I tasted the food! Now this better be good!  I have never dined in, and my review is based on 2 Togo orders. One for lunch at work, and one I brought home for dinner. Trip number one I ordered the Cottage pie, and my boss tried to vegan rosemary chicken. Also got the chips with jalapeno and garlic. Chips are fries, and would be better dining in. Good, just got a bit mushy. Pasties were to die for. Flaky crust that didn't get soggy. Stuffed so full of goodness. Depending on what your pasty choice is you receive a side of gravy, marinara, ketchup, or whatever may go good with yours!  My second trip we ordered Cajun chicken, meat and cheese, and the pastrami. Everyone was happy and would order theirs again. The garlic mashed potato side is FULL of garlic and I was a huge fan of the baked cauliflower and broccoli. Crust was perfect.  I have yet to try their desserts, but I have a feeling when I do- my rating will go to 5 stars.  Don't let the yuck location scare you off, this place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"While in Tempe on business I found this place on Yelp and the reviews sent me right over for lunch. Once I finally decided that the front door was, in fact, the front door (it's a bit dark and seems like you're entering the back of the kitchen or something) I had a seat at a small table along the wall. Once my eyes adjusted, I fell in love with the place. The atmosphere is great. The menu is amazing. The beer list is generous. I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the pesto chicken pastry. We shared a coleslaw. First off, the coleslaw was the best we have ever eaten. Secondly, I wish I lived in Tempe because I want to go back and try everything else on the menu. It was killer! Totally delicious. Soft flaky crusts, amazing dipping sauces, ice-cold beer and great service. They really have a good thing going here. I want to open one in Austin."}
{"text":"Being British I was skeptical about trying this place. However it didn't disappoint. I had the lamb and mint pasty and my husband had the bangers and mash pasty. It was excellent!"}
{"text":"A hybrid of a Calzone and a glorified Hot Pocket, Stuffed with some of the most amazing combos of food you could think of! you could go here for lunch everyday for months and never get the same thing and be just as happy every time! Wouldn't go at lunch time though, it's out of control busy!! Great selection of alcohol as well. TWO THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"You know how when something has been talked up and talked up for what seems like an eternity, it's often a let-down when you finally try it for yourself?  Well, Cornish Pasty is nothing like that.  It did not disappoint.  Great atmosphere, service, prices, and of course amazing food.  We started with cups of homemade soup.  The split pea was fantastic.  Definitely worth navigating around the little bits of ham, which, as the waitress had assured me, were not too terribly prevalent in the soup.  Sorry, ham - I don't like you.  My friend's cream of tomato soup was delicious as well.    We then shared the rosemary chicken pasty.  I'll be honest: this was not among my top 5 pasty choices on the menu, but my desire to share rather than order my own and eat myself sick prevailed and I decided to be flexible.  It's always nice to be flexible anyway, right?    In speaking with our server, we found out that the pastys are made ahead of time so they can't really be customized.  Normally I might be appalled by that, but there's so much crap in there that maybe it would take an hour to prepare them on the spot, and with so many menu options you should be able find one that you wouldn't want to modify.  So I'm okay with the pre-made factor.  My sixth choice pasty actually managed to wow me.  The bread and all the ingredients complimented each other perfectly and tasted great with the accompanying sauce.  I can see why Cornish Pasty has such a loyal following.  Can't wait to bring some more friends there for the oohs and aahs and exclamations of 'how did you find this great place?!'  The credit goes to Yelp."}
{"text":"From the outside it's hard to tell if this place is still in business, but don't let the exterior fool you, you want to go inside. I grew up in a small, country town in Michigan with a large Cornish population, the people who brought the pasty to the USA, and have eaten A LOT of pasties in my life so I was skeptical of how good the ones here could be. I was totally blown away. The crust is made in-house and very flaky. The fillings are traditional (but they're missing the rutabaga), or you can try one of their specialty concoctions. I went with the traditional and was very happy with the choice. This is gonna be my new go-to restaurant when I'm feeling a little homesick and need a taste of home. The staff was incredibly friendly and our food came out really fast. It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to to have dinner and share stories with friends.  Let me tell you this place was jammed packed with all the tables filled and the noise level was loud, but you can still carry on a conversation. Okay enough about my time here lets get to the food. WOW is all I can say.  I felt like I was in a English pub.  Huge beer and wine list.  There are so many combination of pasties that's the hardest part was making a decision on which one I wanted.  My husband got the Greek chicken which he gobbled up and I got the Oggie.  The Oggie is fulled with steak, potatoes and other veggies, it was so delicious! I could only eat half.  the pasty crust was light and just melted in you mouth. Okay so here is the deal  My husband had 2 beers I had a cocktail, together we had two pasties and a side order of home made chips and our bill was $35.00 without  tip.  I have been to restaurants in the valley where $35.00 is just for the entree.  Yes Yes Yes we are going to go back.  I want to buy some $7.50 each to cook at home."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had a great experience! They have so many options to choose from and our server was very friendly. The portions are very big and filling so it could even be 2 meals! Our pasties came out fresh and hot. We tried the PB&J dessert pasty and it was awesome, came with ice cream too. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!  They make the pies fresh, and you can tell!  No frozen BS here!  We even took a few home to heat up for dinners during a hectic week. Great flavors, lots of selection."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for some time I was finally in the neighborhood and thought I would give it a try.  I had heard coworkers raving about this place, none of which live anywhere close to it so I figured it must be worth the drive, and I must say they were right!   The food itself was very good, there are tons of  pasties to choose from (it took me a while to remember it is pronounced \"pass-tee\" and not \"pace-tee\".......I'm sure a \"pace-tee\" can be found at a very different establishment nearby).  Anywhere from Sheppard's Pie, to Mexican, to BBQ, you name it.  I plan on trying a variety of them in the future!  The only downfall is it is VERY small.  Walking in I thought I was going down a hallway to the main seating area, but no.  That was it.  With the bar staring literally directly into the kitchen I didn't see anything gross or something that shouldn't be there, so that was good.  You also feel the heat of the kitchen, with only a few fans here and there to relieve you.  All in all a good \"something different\", and the prices are reasonable (about $6-$9, $9 being their \"premium\" selections)."}
{"text":"Out of both locations, this CP is the most intimate and cozy. I always sit at the bar, order a beer and watch the guys behind the counter do their thing. The PASTY, not PASTRY are really good for the most part. Stick to the classics like Shepard's Pie. Any of the other food styles (Italian, Mexican etc) aren't as good. Their soups are also delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town! My family is from the mid-east (MI) and pasty's is a great treat. The Oggie is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is so underrated. It's a lowkey, hipster-vibes kind of restaurant! My best friend and I always come here to catch up.   Their service is great as is their food! I always get truffle fries as an app, the eggplant pasty, and you HAVE to get their banoffee pie for dessert. I'm obsessed with it!!!"}
{"text":"Utterly disgusted with the poor service at this place. I honestly would give ZERO stars, if possible. I've been patiently waiting for the opening of this spot downtown and boy was it a big let down.   The decor is amazing. It's sort of a mix of a bar and a church! Three levels of great space. The downer...you'll never get your food.   Got in after the lunch rush, so the restaurant wasn't packed. Ordered our food and was told it would take no more than 15-20 minutes.....drum roll. We waited 55 minutes and got no food! Not a joke at all...I actually would've preferred it be a joke.   I noticed a table behind us get their food and I stopped a server (not my server because he never came back) to see how that could be when they came in about 15-20 min after we did. He went to check and advised our ticket \"got lost\" and that our food would be out in two minutes. Fast forward 12 minutes later, still no food. My original server locked eyes with me and I believe he might've tinkled on himself because he could tell I wasn't a happy camper.   We got up and told him we're leaving. His response...an excuse. He said our order got behind a big ass table upstairs. Those were literally his words. I let him know I don't care what the excuse was, it's unacceptable. All he did was apologize, no attempts to remedy the issue.   I was seriously excited about the opening of this place, but the chances of me visiting again to give them another shot...slim to Hell No! First impressions are lasting, especially when the service is terrible. Customers don't like to hear excuses, they want solutions. Hell, they actually just want their food. That's what they come for in the first place...good eats!  You have a ton of work to do, Cornish Pasty. Good luck."}
{"text":"The house beer was very good, along w/ berry beer. The veggie tikka masala was yummy, along with the tasty tasty Asiano. The ambience was old school, loved it!!"}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pie.  Has chicken, peas, red potatoes, carrots. Tastes pretty good. You cannot change or add anything, so they are as is."}
{"text":"Been here too many times. The food is always amazing. Last year I made an attempt to try very pasty on the menu and I DID. Pasty do take about 15 mins to bake, so please be patient and the beer is always pouring. Simple food. Amazing food."}
{"text":"Wow! Lamb Vindaloo pasty!!   Shh... Don't tell some of the Indian restaurants in Tempe, but this was the best vindaloo I've had so far in the area. It's that good! Top that off with the mint sauce they served with it and you have one hell of a meal. I also got to try the carne adovada pasty, and it was amazing as well. Imagine the contents of an amazing burrito inside a flaky pastry crust, and there ya go! Needless to say that I will be back here. I really can't believe it took me years to go here, but I'm glad I at least got around to it."}
{"text":"I love meat pies and I love pasties (all types). This place has it all. PLUS THEY HAVE WINGS AS APPETIZERS. Their wide selection, incredibly tender and flavorful options along with an absolutely terrific beer menu makes this place a smash hit. The only problem is all their pies are premade so there are no substitutions or even removals. You just have to eat them as is."}
{"text":"My Dad grew up in Montana eating pasties so when he found this place he was so happy to try it. He thought it was great so he was anxious to share it with my husband and I.  Well I am thrilled he did. We shared some chips with garlic to start and all four of us got a different pasty. They were delicious and seriously filling, I only ate half of mine but it reheated great for lunch the next day. I got the rosemary chicken and the flavors blended very well and the dipping sauce just set it all off. My mom got the lovely bit of salmon, which I was skeptical of, and it really was good with the fish being a great consistency. My husband got the Mexican and ate it all and fast so that was a winner. Finally my dad got the pilgrim which he said was like Thanksgiving in a pouch and he got an Oggie to take home for the next day. I was also pleasantly surprised to find I really enjoyed the cider they had on tap. I asked the bartender what it was like and after describing it he let me try a little to make sure I liked it before I ordered. My husband was nearly overwhelmed by the beer options and is looking forward to going back to try more. We all really liked the atmosphere and the music was a great mix. In all we are looking forward to going back as there are many other flavors we want to try."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vindaloo pasty for lunch and was not impressed. It was a stronger, spicier, and sweeter sauce then I was used to from Vinaloo at most Indian restaurants and didn't go that well with the pasty. I might give the place a second chance though because everyone else I went with seemed happy with what they got."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is terrific. Three levels to choose from. We chose to eat in the basement, which has a real speak-easy feel to it. It is dark and easy to talk to your tablemates.   There is a bar in the basement so it is easy to get your drink on. And the foot was terrific. I had never been to a Cornish Pasty location, so I tried their Oggi, which is their basic pasty. It was so well done. The crust was just thick enough, the meat and veggies were tender and juicy, and the red wine gravy...wow. You could drink that stuff, it is so good.  Portions are huge. I had to take home half. If you do that, be sure to reheat your food in the oven. It is worth the extra time so it comes out heated through and with a crispy outside."}
{"text":"So good. Words cannot describe the euphoria. Guinness stew pasty was amazing. Spouse had the peppered steak. Also delicious. Great environment. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is PERFECT!  The menu is rather unique and there's something to suit everyone's taste.  They have a pasty for everyone: from traditional savory options to sweet PB&J offerings, anyone can find something to love!  My favorite: the \"indian\" inspired options, like the lamb vindaloo.  The only thing I would change would be the fires - they were a bit undercooked.  Still, this is an exciting and delicious experience, and surely one of the best places the valley has to offer.  Top it of with reasonable prices and a good beer selection, and you've got a winner!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I try something new and the pasties are always superb. This time with the cottage pie ftw! Oh and ALWAYS get the red wine gravy as a side. It's crack"}
{"text":"Don't let the homeless guys sleeping on the sidewalk scare you away. The pastys are comfort food at it's finest & totally affordable. No tv's so you either have to resort to staring at your phone or socializing & playing pool. Appears to be a great late night spot as well. Guiness stew pasty w/ red wine gravy is out of this world. And if you go here for lunch, well I took a 4 hour nap right after so there's that. Andrew (or Anthony? ) behind the bar was fantastic at making you feel at home and reeling in a new regular. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This place is great, I've had the steak and cheese, carne avoda (not sure of spelling) and the chicken portabella. Steak and cheese was my favorite. The pastry shell has the nice airy consistency of quality apple pie crust. The  staff are friendly and quick. It's not fast food the pasties are made on demand so it takes a few minutes which gives u time to sample their excellent beer selection. They're located in the weirdly amazing commercial center, a secret enclave of world class restaurants where Cornish pasty co will fit right in. I'm glad to have this new option in the neighborhood. The place is comfortable and unpretentious.  Note the pasties are a pretty good size so u might want to share if you're not starving. The layout is a large bar and open kitchen with dining tables around the outer perimeter of the bar."}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for almost 5 years and have driven by hundreds of times and not given it a second thought.  I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as \"calzones filled with awesomeness\".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.  With my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!  My only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.  Our new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.    Also, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy."}
{"text":"This is a funky little place with awesome comfort food and nice service.  If you're into light, this is not the place for you.  Think more underground cafe.  The food is homemade and delicious.  But seriously, dessert.  I had the banoffee.  There's not much better in the world than that.  I would have to say that this place might even be a good reason to live in Arizona."}
{"text":"Cool place, great music/food. The entree & dessert pies are great, covered with delicious French pasty & full of culinary goodness. Maybe a few too many hipsters for my taste, but will still return all the same."}
{"text":"This was my first pasty experience.  I had the meat and cheese pasty.  It was really good.  I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm a meat and potatoes guy so I tried the meat & cheese pasty  I also added a side of good old British baked beans, which had a wonderful seasoning. The pasty was excellent!  There are lots of great options for future visits including a traditional British Breakfast all day long.  The place is a bit dark - my Transitions lenses were tricked by the sunlight outside the window and the darkness inside.  I had to remove them to read the menu but that wasn't a big handicap.    Great place!"}
{"text":"Service was really weird wasn't explained well enough that one side of the restaurant was bar serving. Love the location in Scottsdale not this one. We sat here for 20 minutes before waitress came over said something. We were in a rush so we left."}
{"text":"This place is amazing traveling a lot back and forth do to work I love discovering new places and amazing food !! I've seen this place before and I been wanting to try it for a long time.. Finally I did !! And I am so happy !! The people working there are all awesome my waiter was so awesome and helpful he explained all the menu and what the food is like and I had total trust on him ! I basically told him I'll take the most popular one here and a good appetizer.. And yep he did not let me down !! It was delicious and amazing !!!!!!!! He was so kind and made sure I had everything I need it , and to mention he was working the tables and the bar total superman  I wish I had his name but all I can say is he was not bad to look at dark hair Hahahaha very handsome  !! I will be going back every time I'm in this area thanks for the amazing food and service I am truly happy thank you"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley!  I've been coming here regularly since they opened their doors around 2002-3 and is a must visit for out of town guests.  You cant go wrong with anything on the menu, and by now I've had almost everything!  My favorite of all time is the Chicken Greek and it amazes me with every bite!  What is a pasty you ask?  This is a common question, and I've never experienced them before I found this place or have really ever seen them anywhere else.  They are kind of like a calzone, but instead of the ingredients being encased in a pizza dough crust, it is more like a pie crust.  Super yummy!  And these are no ordinary pasties, they are gourmet pasties.  A close second to the Chicken Greek is the Spicy Asiago Chicken for me.  With around 38 different types of pasties, everyone can find something they will want to try, as well as an impressive vegetarian selection.  The ambiance is excellent too.  You really feel like you're in a European Pub and not tucked away in a random strip mall in Tempe.  The beer selection is very nice and the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  This is a true pub atmosphere and is pretty dark inside and does get quite busy during peak hours.  Most of the inside seating are old church pews on each side of very long tables.  Several parties can comfortably sit at each of these tables, but there really isn't anything separating these long tables and pews, and there is potential for your small group to be \"invaded\" by a larger group moving in on that table.  I love the look of the church pews and dimly lit candle light that adds to the Gothic feel to the place though, and have only once felt a little \"taken over\" by a bigger group (was a Fri night) in all my years of coming here.  They have a very nice outside patio with more separated tables, which is an excellent option during the cooler times of the year here.  I remember when this was a teeny tiny little place serving amazing food and am very happy for the owner's success and their incredible expansion, not only to the neighboring suites at this location, but through out the valley and beyond!  I am a life long customer and will continue to spread the word of my favorite restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Good selection of craft beer that compliments the food. Nice calm atmosphere. The staff there gave off a good vibe and engage in small conversations about there product knowledge of their menu. Server/bartender named Hoku was awesome. Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stayed in Phoenix last weekend to go to Kenny Chesney's concert at Chase Field and were starving after the concert.  This place got bombarded at 11 pm with folks hungry like us.  Hubby had the Chicken Pot Pie pastry which he devoured and I had the Cuban pasty.  Both were delicious.  Highly recommend trying this place out.  And, I wish there was a place like this that I could go to near us in Huntington Beach."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  For a family of four we ordered three and it was perfect.  Cool vibe and everything on the menu looked awesome and we couldn't decide which of the pasties we liked best.  Royale with cheese, Carne adovada and the Shepherd pie were all excellent."}
{"text":"This is a cool hole in the wall hideaway! Every time I've been there it's been crazy busy. The pot pies are great and their deserts are absolute dangerous wonderful. The service has always been perfect and I always look forward to friends gathering there to show off what great food choices we have in this area. It is dark in there so I'm thinking if it was lit up, John Taffer would have a field day!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. The portions. A great way to share with others.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I did not like this location AT ALL.   I was overwhelmed on where to park... I couldn't figure out if you park in front or back.  Then I couldn't figure out where the front door was or where you get seated at.  I walked in a complete circle around the place 1 1/2 times.  Then it is dark and crowded.  The service was very hurried and it was not conducive to sitting and enjoying a meal together as there were people waiting for our table (if you are even lucky enough to get a private table).  I much much much prefer the Dobson/Guadalupe location and won't return to this one.  However, the food is delicious.  The potato leek soup.  Yummmmm... the bread it is served with is Yummmmm... the pasty was Yummmm (I had the vegetarian potato one with ketchup).  Wish I had saved room for the peanut butter and jelly dessert one as I like it so much."}
{"text":"Had the rueben simply awesome. Crust was just right. Nice open view kitchen.  3 levels of seating.  Wish could transport it to where i live"}
{"text":"Super cool little spot!  The menu is really diverse and big for being pretty much completely made up of pasties. There are vegan options that are absolutely amazing!!! I literally thought they gave us the wrong one because the fake chicken was so convincing! Drinks were really good, rosemarys baby cocktail was the all around favorite but the lavender honey being a close second. Great service from the server who's name I forgot with the long dark hair who makes boom boxes out of old suitcases. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food and good selection of craft beers!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The Scotch Egg is something that has been missing from your life. It was amazing. The taste and texture were phenomenal. The thin outer shell is crispy, light and delicious. Once you break through the crispy shell it's a layer of sausage. This sausage is succulent and moist and if that's not enough you still have the hard boiled egg to look forward to. I can't rave enough about this appetizer. This is something you must try while in Vegas. Absolutely wonderful! I almost forget to mention the honey mustard sauce that accompanies this amazing combo."}
{"text":"A modern take on a British staple, Cornish Pasty Company has about 50 different pasties to choose from including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and even some dessert pasties too!   The restaurant has a Brit pub feel to it, with a bar bar on one side and a dining area and counter seating on the other.   Cornish Pasties were a working class food for miners. They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large.   Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.  Lamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended.   Peppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it.   If I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous.   The only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it.   Unexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to.   Now if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)..."}
{"text":"Fat kids rejoice! Comfort food at the finest. The soup is so good, try it!"}
{"text":"This place is the spot. Amazing inside and out. Underground vibe, crusty snacks, sexy suds, tasty tracks, you're good for the night here. The salads are pretty good and they have a dedicated veggy section which always tickles my fancy."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I can never go wrong with them. Every time I go they're always out of the Royale w/ Cheese but I finally was able to get it this time. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was really slow. The food served was cold. Will never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! I had never had a pasty before going here, and it was definitely worth all of the hype I saw on yelp. The ambiance was the first thing I noticed when I walked it. It's a very long, dimly lit restaurant with limited seating if you're not into sitting at a bar (which, I don't mind). One of the servers was quick to notice our group right away, and provided us with drinks as we waited for a place to sit. The beer was very diverse and exciting, which made me extra happy. The grub was great... I got the pork with mashed potatoes pasty with a red wine dipping sauce. I have to agree with past reviews and say that the dipping sauce was delicious! Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll be making my way back to this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place with super unique and very delicious menu. This place is a great spot for groups with non meat eaters because they have lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"How have I lived here all my life and never heard of this place until last week?!   We tried this place with a group of friends who had been here before.  When they described the menu, I had a hard time imagining anything other than the English version of a calzone.    I couldn't have been more wrong!  From the laid back and hipster atmosphere to the jalapeno \"chips\" and attentive but not intrusive server, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and it's good but not as amazing as people made it out to be. I got The Oggie and my friend tried The Porky. Both were yummy and the red wine gravy was delicious. Also, tried the Scotch egg and the garlic mashed potatoes which were good too."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night after hearing Cornish Pasty finally opened the night before...so exciting for our downtown neighborhood!  There are three levels to the restaurant, so we checked each one out before deciding to sit upstairs in the \"pub-like\" atmosphere.  I ordered a chicken tikka masala pasty and a blood orange cider...so delicious!    Overall, great atmosphere, great service and great food - a welcome addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Went to Cornish Pasty for the first time this weekend and it was great! They have an extensive pasty menu with something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike. I had a vegan \"Chicken\" pot pie pasty and it was delicious. Our waiter was very accommodating and came up with ideas for dipping sauces that were also vegan. Also ordered the chips and they were great! Good drink menu with mixed drinks, beer and wine. I will definitely be back, give it a try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty cool, open to the street. Food was good. I think they are having a hard time keeping up or something because only about 1/3 of the menu choices were available?  It was my birthday and I went as a treat on my 85 yr old next door neighbor. He rarely goes out but I'd mentioned I wanted to check the place out. I had heard it was good. My biggest complaint: with three levels of seating, someone forgot to include handicapped accessible?! My neighbor could neither go up or down stairs and there was hardly any seating on main level. Worst of all, none of the staff seemed to get it. We won't be the first or the last, eventually they will catch on."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Excellent service and amazing food.  Had the Guinness Pasty and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are trying food from different nationalities each week, we call it \"Foreign Food Friday\". Today: The Cornish Pasty. It was new to all of us, and we all loved it! The food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and we had a great time. There was one waitress and one cook working the lunch hour and they were on their game, service didn't falter for one minute. I had the Reuben Pasty...divine! I'll definitely be back! (probably next week!)"}
{"text":"The beer tender at Tenaya Creek recommended we try out this restaurant and I'm so glad we did. They were open late on a Monday night and quickly prepared our to-go order while my fiancé and I hung out at the bar. The vegetarian pastys are amazing. A week later I was back in Vegas for a convention and took some of my classmates there. Everyone enjoyed the food, service, and nice escape from the summer heat."}
{"text":"I'm dying just reviewing this place because unless they make one of these in San Diego, I'll probably never get a chance to eat these delicious little flakey, savory pies. It isn't fair!  Everything here is awesome.  They have a great selection of vegetarian pies.  You can basically get any pie they make with a vegetarian substitute.  The beers (good selection of craft beer) are priced very reasonably and you can upgrade from 14 to 20oz for $1 or from 20 to 32oz for another $1.  Crazy!  I was a little weirded out by the pew seating, but after I got right with the big man that made these pies possible (the chef of course) it was cool."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Had the Tika masala and the lamb vindaloo...great favors....hibiscus tee was very good.... Really great service...will return!"}
{"text":"I was out in the East Valley for a meeting, so met a friend for lunch since we don't see each other often. She suggested Cornish Pasty and said it was one of her favorite spots.  This place is amazing! I had the pasty that has salmon, asparagus, potatoes (can't recall it's name), and it was delish. She had the Cajun Chicken and told me it was one of her two favorites. So many of the pasties sounded so good!!  I will be back... My husband will love this place."}
{"text":"So yummy! I have never had this type of dish and since my fiance is OBSESSED with anything British, I knew he'd like it. It has a dive bar atmosphere while not actually being a dive bar.  The ambience is super romantic which I loved since we jyst got engaged.   Our server was busy and still took great care of us so well.  She was a cute girl with long red hair  (I believe).  She was fantastic! The food was delicious.  I'm a vegetarian and they have a whole vegetarian menu!!!! They use Quorn patties and that's my fave! We are moving too Gilbert soon here and I suspect we will be regulars. The only reason for 1 star knocked off is the bathrooms.  Yuck! Absolutely horrendous."}
{"text":"The oggie is so good & my sister tried the pilgrim which she said made her mouth soooo happy!"}
{"text":"All these yelpers couldn't be wrong! This place is deeeeelish! Some many different options, it's hard to choose a pastry. Not sure if u could go wrong on any of them.... The beer selection is pretty decent. The secret beer is a hazelnut brown ale (rogue brewery). It's not really a secret it's just not on the menu, but it's amazing. Normally im not a fan of rogue, but whatever. We had the banoffee for dessert! They whipped the cream as we ordered, it was perfect. The service was ok, we seemed to have 3 ppl serving us. The female was def. less attentive, but the boys were on point.This place is absolutely worth trying but don't expect any thing fancy. If they changed anything it would lose it's charm. Nothing else like it in az."}
{"text":"I really wish I could eat this every day! such a cool out of the way place we stumbled on it when we were supposed to meet friends next door for dinner but there wasn't space available...thank goodness! because this was so much better. really nice atmosphere, everyone working there seems really cool and friendly but the best reason to go here is the delicious pasty's, which is basically like the most delicious giant hot pocket you've ever had. they have tons of filling options  fromtraditional meat and potato's to carne asada. but my favorite so far was the dessert Carmel apple yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"So good!!! My kids loved the burger and bangers n mash pasties.  The tiki masala was awesome and so was the classic and Greek... Casual little place... Super good!"}
{"text":"Oh so amazing, I ate one there and it was so good, I also took one home and baked it myself and it too was amazing. They have tons of different options and tons of different types of food. Service is very nice"}
{"text":"The food is so good.  I've never had a pasty, other than here, so I can't compare it to other places to be honest.  But, my personal favorites are the Mexican, the Peppered Steak, and the Cajun Chicken.  The waitstaff has always been extremely helpful and polite, every time I've been.  There just aren't enough good things to say about this place.  You have to know what you're expecting tho, it is in the same shopping center as Lotus of Siam, but there's not as much of a transformation when you walk in here.  It does give off the first impression of a dive bar when you walk in, but if you can get over that and embrace how instead of divey, it's just comfortable/casual."}
{"text":"I've had horrible service here twice. The server, who was obviously stoned as hell, took our drink order and came back with them after 20 minutes. Which I thought was forgivable. The food was good so I let that slide and paid the bill and left, the second time I came here I swear, the service was so slow, it took an extra thirty minutes to drop the check, and NO ONE was in the place, except for some drunk dude at the bar.   The scottsdale location is always good, maybe it's just this one being near asu."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world good, the hype is real..they serve these English hot pockets that are second to none.  First, they're original, but even their ingredients are quality, you don't get that processing taste and full of flavor. I had the Pilgrim, and it was thanksgiving in my mouth, minus the dried turkey and football.  Drinks are nice and stout as well, so I can not give them less than 5 stars.. service was a little lax, but it was a bit busy so, take that into consideration. I will be back as soon as I get back out east, there aren't any west side locations."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome.  Everything you read in the other reviews is true.  Pastys are hot pockets of pastry filled with love.  I had the peppered steak pasty with the peppercorn brandy sauce and it was amazing.  My server Justin was awesome, very friendly and understanding that this was my first visit.  The location in Tempe is small but full of character.  Sit at the bar and watch the food being made.  Even the cooks were friendly and willing to talk about what they were doing.  Absolutely have an Irish Car bomb (Guinness with a shot of Jameson whiskey and Bailey's Irish Cream).  They are only $3 a day, every day!!!  The place is a bit hard to find but it's totally worth the work.  Your efforts will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always head there for special occasions. We have tried most of the pasties and have not been disappointed"}
{"text":"Why isn't there a place like this where I live?  I am seriously going to be looking for excuses to come to Tempe so I can eat here again.  Decent beer list, and pub food with a large vegetarian section... very rare!  I had the portabello pasty and it was fabulous.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Cornish Pasty. Very unique building with 3 different levels and 3 different atmospheres. I sat on the top floor honestly because that's where most of the people we're sitting.   Staff was great, very attentive and friendly.   Food was unique. Basically a delicious meal wrapped up into a pastry.  I ordered the scotch egg (which was good) and the Tikka masala pasty which was great.   One thing that concerned me was that you can't make edits/special requests to the food. That screams frozen premade food to me. BUT my meal came out using delicious and not previously frozen.   Prices are very good. All pastys are around $11 and they have an ok happy hour.   If I had my way with this place, I wish I could get 2 or 3 pastys for the same price. Lots of different options to choose from so I really would have liked to try multiple of them vs the one big one.   I would definitely come back here to try the different pastys as the number of options is great.   Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Went in after a day of shopping with my mother. We walked into the bar side and decided we wanted to sit in the pew benches on the restaurant side instead. We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun. Great lunch! Will go again when I'm in Tempe. Another plus: enough for left overs!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to eat! The food is always delicious and the beer selection is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been here more than a handful of times and I really WANT to like ...No! I want to LOVE this place ... but I can't get over how dirty it feels when ever I am here. I love the menu, which is very English to me... Lots of pasty options. But when a place is dirty and sticky, I can't get around the fact that my food is likely not prepared in the most hygienic of states either. This past week we opted for this for a quick bite while we found ourselves in Tempe.. again, I like the menu and there are a few ciders, mine wasn't cold and ciders need to be icy to be tasty. I wasn't wow'd by the Oven Chips.. a version of the French Fry, which were drenched in oil and not one bit of crisp.. my Guinness Stew Pasty was lackluster, but it sounded great on the food splattered menu..  and again... this place is filthy, downright to the disgusting bathrooms. Pass."}
{"text":"By and large, I am a huge fan of the American revolution, \"give me liberty or give me death,\" and all that jazz. However, the tainted, revisionist history textbooks that brainwash our youth these days cleverly gloss over the greatest void created when the british were expunged: exquisite hand-held edibles. Over the last 200 years, the sandwich has had its day, the hamburger did its best to satisfy, and fringe cultists have clung to the wrap, shawarma, burrito, or gyro for solace, but now you can have the real deal in all its glory! Soft, flaky, golden crust that makes every Marie Calendar's pie, Hotpocket, and Toaster Struedel hang it's head in shame! Variegated, creative, symphonious fillings that arch like piping hot rainbows over your fortunate tongue. I have to stop now, or else I won't be able to resist driving the 11 hours from salt lake to salvation. Ironically, given this verbacious soliloquy, my favorite pasty is probably the pilgrim."}
{"text":"Super good food and beer. Open bar and kitchen so you can see how it's done. Perfect spot for hipsters and foodies."}
{"text":"Best pasties on the planet!!!! Awesome atmosphere and delicious food, plus an awesome alcohol selection."}
{"text":"Been to another one in Old Scottsdale and it seemed better. Very dark but music was good.   No TVs to watch games.   Food was Good but not great as expected."}
{"text":"Staff is great, food is amazing, and the beer is cold.    What more do you want    !!!!!"}
{"text":"Really cool place, great food, beer selection, cool friendly staff and eclectic ambiance."}
{"text":"There are quite a few good-looking varieties of the pasty on the menu - makes for a difficult choice. When you do make a choice, you'll end up with a flavorful pastry filled with tasty ingredients."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. They really are setting the bar for current & future Arts District establishments ( everyone else should look to them & Velveteen Rabbit for how it's done ). Beautiful space, great food, awesome staff and a really great beer selection ( I never had the same one twice ) served by a sweetheart of a bearded bartender. Downtown Crown should be scared, they don't have long for this world with Cornish just across the street, and good riddance!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here if your some pie crust guru believes your own crust is the best.  This isn't betty Crocker.... This is Betty Crocker on crack. By far one of THE best pot pies I have ever had.  The crust (which I ate several minutes after I husband delivered it to the hotel room) was perfectly crusty and well seasoned.  The interior of my \"pasty\" was flavored to the up most perfection with delicate little carrots and chunks of chicken.  I feel like someone finally tapped into my dreams and made the perfect pie.  I feel like nothing will ever compare.  It's a blessing I don't live here or I would gain a zillion pounds.  Oh- and those frickin curry potatoes.  GOD BLESS. stop already.  I can't handle the goodness."}
{"text":"Good food, ordered two different ones for pick up. They were both pretty good, nice to have something a little different. The location is totally random is a old strip mall but don't let that stop you from checking it out."}
{"text":"Great food and a good price and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I've never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. I kind of liked their old \"hole in the wall\" location, but this one is right by the Smith Center so we always stop by after a show. Hubby is from England and he says these are the real deal."}
{"text":"Low lit and chill with good music. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty and a Hoegaarden. If you need a break from America and need to step into the next best thing to a British Pub - go here."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. We ordered the chicken pesto pasty and it was fabulous!! The only thing we didn't love is the wait staff wasn't incredibly friendly or welcoming. Despite this, we will definitely be back!   We went again yesterday and the waitstaff was more friendly! Great food every time."}
{"text":"Incredible food , Great staff , atmosphere , all around a pleasurable experience. Tell your friends one of Tempe's Greatest restaurants.  Its worth the trip.... Thanks Dean !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food , Friendly staff, great atmosphere, And import beers from places I've never heard of before.... Had a awesome evening there the hardest part was leaving. Love the new place very well put together !!!!!   5 stars all day long in my book. try the meat and cheese for the safe people and carne Avado if ya like a little spice in your life. desserts are yummy too. We will be back soon thanks again....My wife recommends the pasta salad !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It really is as good as it gets. I've been there 4 to 5 times and have tried a lot of dishes. Bangers & Mash was ok, but I really loved the Chicken Tikka Masala. Soups are amazing, and come with slices of bread & butter. It's really heavy. Oven chips is the best side I've had over there. Deserts are amazing as well. They have lot of drinks but I tend to go with what the staff recommends. I've never been disappointed.  Tip : It might look a bit shady, but don't let that deter you. Take the leap of faith and trust me, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty rad little place tucked away in a strip mall. Wasn't sure what to expect after a few people had described pasties as similar to a calzone, or spanakopita, or basically meat wrapped in dough with extra things. I was shocked to see a huge menu with literally every food group you could imagine, all wrapped in dough. You can get eggplant Parmesan, a Reuban, Chicken Tikka Masala, a Cheeseburger, Greek veggies, etc. EVERYTHING but the kitchen sink.   The beer menu was pretty extensive too which was cool, and I suppose that's what draws the young, hip crowd in. The place was packed on a Friday around 7pm, with people waiting for tables! We sat at the bar and I ordered a Rogue Dead Guy Ale with my Cheeseburger pasty. Something to note: they do not carry mustard.   It was pretty good, really filling and dense. I couldn't finish it-which is a rare experience for me, but I'm glad I had my first pasty experience! At only $9 bucks it's quite a deal and warms your bones on a cold day."}
{"text":"I tried the southwest chicken pasty and it was very tasty. The crust was thin, crispy, and flavorful. The mixture of chicken, cheese, beans, corn, and salsa inside had a nice and slightly spicy Mexican flare. The pasty was something like $6 and plenty for one person. The food is definitely the high point for this place.  The place was very busy when we arrived with about 8 people and we had to wait a long time to snatch a table (we were on \"the list\" but they don't appear to actually honor any such arrangements versus a free-for-all). There was also only one server running around the whole place, so it was difficult to place orders, get refills, remove leftover encrusted plates, etc. The drinks are priced relatively low and there were many types of beers on tap, which probably makes it a popular place for the college crowd.   Overall, this might be a nice place to actually dine if it had better service and wasn't such a dive bar rather than an eatery. It would be nice if there were separate areas for a dinning room and bar. Right now, it seems like it really wants to be a bar, but it happens to randomly serve some good food."}
{"text":"Terrific beer selection and deliciously authentic pasties. They were playing some great punk rock, too. BTW, they mentioned that they are moving to a much larger space soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas. I live nearby, and it took me nearly two years to 'discover' this place. The service is fantastic and friendly. The beer selection on tap has some great craft beers and the pasties.... Holy wow. Flaky crispy crusts and delicious well seasoned fillings. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"I had eaten at the Cornish in Tempe az, so I couldn't wait for this to open! I strongly recommend this place. Will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"A friend in Las Vegas recommend CPC to me so I stopped in while staying the night in Phoenix. The server was super friendly, and the food was nothing short of amazing. The place had a really cool atmosphere, and I will probably eat there every time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great traditional Pasty's and great service. The new location is really nice as well. If you are in for some comfort food and a cold pint this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed since it's tucked on the side of its complex.  However, upon entering I was pleasantly surprised. It's fairly small with the bar on one side and booths on the other but it's full of big, loud, and alternative personalities. The music they play is awesome and the workers are all really cool.  The food is awesomely comforting and filling. The amount of vegetarian pasties they offer is incredible. The veggie pesto chicken is extremely flavorful, the eggplant parmesan is chocked full of various delicious veggies like zucchinis, broccoli, spinach, etc., and the veggie mexican is an awesome take on a typical breakfast burrito. The portions are always huge and I always leave extremely happy on my overall experience."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, no matter which location I go to. The ambience is really European, and has a rustic feel to it. The furniture is nice but not super comfy, and the tables are decorated in a very interesting way. The food is innovative, and their pasties definitely stand out. I've tried a number of them, and two of my favorites are the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala. Service can be a little slow, especially during the busy hours of lunch and dinner, but it's worth it. Their soups and salads are great too, and highly recommended. I've even had their pasties to go sometimes, since they are one of the very few places that are open till midnight everyday. Great work guys!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend after a volunteer project and I was not impressed. First off, the entrance to the restaurant is not on University Dr but rather on S. Hardy Dr.   Upon entering, my eyes had to adjust to the extremely dark lighting and interior. There are several entrances to the place so you might have to walk around a bit to get to the main dining area. We walked through the bar area (which smelled like a college pub) to arrive at the main dining area which was fairly empty. There was only one other table occupied besides ours and a couple patrons at the bar. After, we were at a loss of what to do as no one directed us towards a table or told us to seat ourselves. Finally, we asked the chef and he said you can grab any table you want. My friend went up to get menus herself and we perused for several minutes before our waitress arrived. She was helpful in taking our order but she certainly took her time in attending to us and serving our food. Which was confusing to me as there was only one other table she had to attend to.   When I asked her what the red wine gravy was made of, she was confused by my question and did not answer correctly. She did state that the alcohol evaporates however I could clearly taste it when I ate it with my pasty.   This place's only saving grace was its food. I ordered the Oggie pasty which was wonderful except the meat tasted slightly undercooked. My friends all loved their pasties and the flavors came together beautifully.   They did split the check between four credit cards.  Overall, I would not come back, nor would I recommend this place to others. At post, take your food togo because the atmosphere of the restaurant definitely downgrades the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing......everything there has been good so far, been going there for years now, since they had one location that resembled a dark hallway,lol."}
{"text":"This place is a bit obscure. It is kind of hidden from the main street as it is facing the residential road. I almost missed it on my way here! Once you go past the black door, you enter a dark, dimly lighted bar. There are large booths for large parties and tables for small groups. The bar extends throughout the entire place so there is plenty of seating. The restroom cleanliness is typical for a pub and is well maintained. There are plenty of TVs if you looking to watch a game there.  Since this place is known for their pasties, I decided to try one out. I ordered The Chicken Greek Pasty to go along with my Hoegarden beer. The portion size is just about right, wasn't too big nor too small. The pasty was hot and fresh. What made it really good was the sauce that was provided with the pasty. I almost didn't have enough for the entire pasty! My one gripe about the pasty is that I wish it had a bit more chicken. Other than that, it was superb.  This place has a good happy hour menu and a pretty extensive selection of beers on tap and on bottle. The service was good for the most part. Other than forgetting one of the sauces for the people of my party it was pretty good throughout. They delivered our food and drinks in a timely manner and was helpful with the first timers with what to order. I wish I can give this place 4.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll have to give it four."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co. is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas. My only regret is not finding it sooner!  The food is outstanding-- every single flavor of pasty is delicious, you can't go wrong. I think of a pasty as a combination between a pot pie and a turnover, but truly, a pasty is a pasty. There is a whopping selection of delicious vegetarian pasties (and even a few vegan ones), and meat lovers can rejoice because there are about 20-30 super hearty meat pasties! They all come with unique homemade sauces. The soups are to die for. The sides are little slices of heaven. The deserts are drool-worthy. AND THE PASTIES ARE AMAZING! You can take them home to heat up but I prefer them fresh out of the oven at their location. The best part is that the family recipes that the team uses are tried and true AND CONSISTENT. Everything is always good. There's never an off day. I find myself Shazaaming their music on the regular. Their service is outstanding. All of the employees are so incredibly friendly and kind and just plain awesome!"}
{"text":"Dim and a bit moody when you walk in, but nice and cozy the minute you finally take a seat. To put it simply , this place serves comfort food at it's finest. The assortment of meat pies is phenomenal. Although you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, my personal favorite is the Cajun. Between the flakey, moist, buttery crust and the spicy chicken, it is definitely a fine creation. Come check it out. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This small venue has more space than before, bring your friend's!  Really good food, beer selection is decent and the service was friendly, and efficient.  Great place to relax and enjoy a casual evening out, without having to venture to the pricey Mill Avenue area!"}
{"text":"I so appreciate their move to downtown. It's much better than Commercial Center. I do miss the parking at the old location. With the construction in downtown, plan ahead on where you are parking.  After living in England, I'm picky on certain foods.  The Scotch egg is good. It's almost great. Many people including my friends are afraid to order it due to it not being something that most see.   I tend to stick to my traditions and get very British like pasties. All have been good and have met my need for British food."}
{"text":"Couple things.  First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didn't know that they delivered... Now you do!)  You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  It's a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol.  *TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasn't even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food.  At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way.  Cornish Pasty's (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version.  Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS.  Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!"}
{"text":"this place is so darn cute!  You might miss it if you are driving too fast.  The food is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I had the pot pie, mmmm was that tasty.  All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.  The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.  With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.  The dessert was out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu! I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!"}
{"text":"First off, a note about the ambience. The door is tinted black so you can't see inside, but once you open it, you'll enter into a dimly lit, but lively set up accompanied by friendly waiters.   So what'd I eat? I got the Bangers and Mash pasty coupled with red wine gravy. It's packed with pork and sausage meat cubes (it tastes better than it looks) and mashed potatoes. It's reminiscent of the microwavable pot pies my mom used to feed me when I was little, except this one's much, much better (thank goodness).   I also sampled my friends' selections. The Mexican is fajitas-filled, and the Pesto Chicken stands on its own league, but broke apart after the first few bites. I personally liked my pick the most, but I have a more traditional pallette. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the pasties."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the Leek/potato soup with Stilton (I was curious about the combination, and it was perfect!).  I also had the Oggie pasty with gravy. Many vegetarian options. Friendly server. Lots of different places to sit, I found a quiet place upstairs. Will definitely come again when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm ecstatic they have added another restaurant downtown and glad it is Cornish Pasty.  The food at Cornish Pasty is consistently good and reasonably priced.  The problem I have with the Monroe location is that it just seems a little dingy and dark to me--more like a bar than a restaurant.  Also, we've been at least 4 or 5 times and the service ranges from bad to mediocre.  The last visit we ordered a salad and a pasty and they brought both at the same time.  Our waiter said if we wanted our salad first, we should have stated that.  Really?  I'll continue to eat at Cornish Pasty because their food is good, and I'll probably continue to save money on the tip . . ."}
{"text":"I've driven by, and each time I have said \"I must go there soon\". Well, I finally went and will become a regular. Let's start with the ambience: dark yet open. The table set up feels like hoards of friends will be joining the party. The music was excellent: All Metal. The employees were welcoming, especially our Server, who genuinely engaged us in a conversation about the food. She knows her craft and made the entire food experience all the better for it. Now to the Pasty: Flakey crust is not easy, but this was perfectly sublime. The filling (I had the Porky) hit every note. The meat had its own, yummily distinctive, flavor, as did the veg. It was as though each were cooked individually, then combined at the last second, to keep the integrity of the flavors. This beautiful combo was swathed in a pastry blanket, and crimped in the traditional style, then cooked so there were little dark bits of carmelized beauty on the underside. My favorite moment, other than the first bite, was getting to the end, where all the juices had hit the thicker part of the pasty crust. This is the stuff of memories. Literally. It's been 45 years since I have had a REAL pasty. I am so thankful to have them back in my life. I will be back soon. I plan on working my way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you how to find this place. Their address says they are off of East Sahara, but I ended up turning on to Commercial Center Drive on my right going east coming from Las Vegas Blvd. If you hit Maryland Parkway, you have gone too far. They are in the same plaza as The Green Door, Lotus of Siam, and Komol, which is right next to them.  Now that you have found the place, you still kind of have to do a double take when you get to the entrance for there are no indications on the doors themselves. All you can go by is their Cornish Pasty sign at the top of the building.  Now, what is a pasty you ask? According to Wickipedia: A pasty (/pæsti/, Cornish: Hogen; Pasti), (sometimes known in the United States as a pastie or British pasty)[1] is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England. It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, without meat in vegetarian versions, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. After baking, the result is a raised semicircular food item.  So now that you know what the technical term is, let me tell you my version, or should I say my good Yelp buddy Chris \"Downtown Chris\" R's version is. Basically, its a gourmet hot pocket, but a hundred times better. Mainly because when you order it, it is made from scratch. When you take that first bite, it's obvious that it did not come from a freezer straight into the microwave. Some people compare it to an empanada. Some think its similar to a chicken pot pie. Whatever you hear, let your own taste buds tell you the truth.  When you first enter the establishment, just the magnificent odor herbs and garlic emanating from the kitchen will tell you that they are whipping up something extraordinary in the kitchen. You have a bar in the middle and you have some pretty good sized tables and benches to comfortably seat your party. The lighting is bit low which could be a good thing for you lovebirds on a first time date or otherwise.  As you check out the menu, you will find that just about every option is mouthwatering. With me, I finally went with the Mexican (8.50). It is Mexican-spiced and simmered steak strips, potatoes, eggs, jalapenos and cheddar. Comes with a side of sour cream and salsa. I also opted for a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese (3.50).  Since me and the wifey were sharing, we were thinking this was enough food. We were wrong. It was more than enough. The Mexican Pasty we ordered was basically a giant hot pocket cut in half. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes came in a medium sized casserole type of bowl with plenty of melted cheese on top of it. This could of been a meal in itself. Needless to say, we had plenty of it left because we were saving room for dessert because my wifey has a sweet tooth.  Again, looking at the dessert menu we were confounded with the delectable options we were gonna have to decide to get. So we ended up getting the Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty (6.00). This concoction has peanut butter, bananas and raspberry jelly whipped cream and raspberry sauce. Comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The best way I can describe this item is that it's like a deep fried peanut butter jelly and banana sandwich topped off with raspberry sauce. Instead of milk you have it in the form of a scoop of vanilla ice cream to wash it down. This was a nice sized item as well and we could only eat half of it. I know my wife was happy for she had something good for lunch the next day.  Service was excellent. Our beverages were constantly filled, food came out in a timely manner, and she answered any and all questions we had with a smile.  Lastly, here are their hours. Mon-Sat 11 am to 12 am Sun 11 am to 10 pm  I love the fact that they close at midnight Monday through Saturday because sometimes, you just happen to be hungry around 9 or 10 because you had an early dinner or was forced to eat your in laws cooking, etc. Whatever your reason is, these guys are here for you!  So in closing, I don't normally do a long review. But when I do, its usually a 5 star worthy place and then some! It's not always that you find a place that you can bring your family where you can get great food with generous portions at great prices and great service. I suggest you make your way here because I  guarantee that once this place gets that much more popular, the only complaint you might have would be that you had to wait because the place was packed!  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #34"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.  The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.  They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it.   I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.  Highly recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Ask any of the staff for their favorites and you won't be let down. They also have lots of vegetarian choices and even some vegan ones! The draught beer selection is tops and the bottled beer is awesome too! As a bonus in my book... There are no TV's or gaming to distract you. This is a great place to meet with friends and have an actual conversation to catch up over savory and original food. Save room for dessert. I highly suggest the STP or Banoffe Pie."}
{"text":"I have eaten Cornish pasties from Elko, NV, which have traditionally been popular with miners.  These were tasty, huge pockets pregnant with ingredients, relatively inexpensive ($2-2.50 each) When I heard of the Cornish Pasty in Vegas, I decided to stop in today for lunch since I was in the Arts District to pick up an art piece from one of the studios.                                                                 From the entrance door I went to the left and was told to seat myself.  I sat down at an empty long bench, furniture looked like church pews, which I thought was cool.  When I told the server I wanted water for a drink (this is supposed to be a British pub), she asked me if I wanted to sit in the back.  I looked back and said, Where, in the dark???  She said Never mind, and everything went downhill from then on.  BTW, I am a mature Asian woman who must have looked out of place in a hip British pub that happens to serve pasties with beer and ale.  There was a youngish couple occupying a longer church pew next to mine and I wondered if they were given the same treatment?                                                                         I was glad to see that there was a Vegetarian/Vegan section in the menu.  My first choice was the Balsamic Portabello but was told they did not have it. The Veggie Pesto Chicken that I ended up eating was tasteless, and the dough was hard.  I found the service slow, and the server never came back other than to give me the bill.  She definitely had an attitude and should not be in  the service industry.  Gave her a measly tip to go with her measly and rude attitude.  I will not go back to this place nor recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"English food should never be labeled as boring and the Cornish Pasty Company will prove it. They offer all of the pasties your heart may desire. But what is a pasty? No, I am not referring to the coverings worn on women's chests. They are baked pastries that usually have a savory meat filling and its semi-circle shaped.   I have been to this delightful spot on 4 different occasions, so it is about time that I write a review. Yum yum yum, It's my go to main street place and my favorite place to bring people who are not a fan of spicy hot food. I am unable to choose my favorite pasty because I simply have not tried enough, but I definitely suggest getting a pasty with beef. The Guinness Stew and the Beef Pot Roast pasty are the two stand out ones.  I have tried a few appetizers, but I cannot say this is a place that I would go for appetizers. So far they have been unimpressive. The meatballs were a bit bland but had good sauce, the liver pate tasted exactly like what I imagine wet cat food to taste like, and the curry fries were okay.   But do not fret; you can fill up plenty with the different pasties, awesome beer selection, and the most incredible desert. One of my yelp friends suggested we try the Sticky Toffee pudding and I am so glad we tried it. It's like a caramelized bread pudding that was moist but crunchy and filled with a perfect not too sweet flavor. We had it with a side of ice-cream, but they had a few different choices of sides that go with it.  Come here for pool, conversations, sitting in church pews, good pasties, and beer. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"176 reviews before mine...what more could I possibly say? I'll just give you a few highlights:   **If you've never had a Cornish Pasty, it will be a new and very enjoyable experience for your taste buds.   **I don't recall the name of our server, but if everyone there is as helpful and friendly as our guy, you'll be in very good hands.   **The salads are inexpensive and delicious. Order one before your meal. You know you need more greens in your life.   **I enjoyed the narrow, small size of this place; it felt cozy. I'm not sure what they do for parties larger than 4 though.   **Arrive. Sit. Order. Enjoy. Leave. Return. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat...."}
{"text":"Frickin' unbelievably awesome.  I want to go back every week until I've tried every single variation.  I had the carne adovada pasty.  Delicious, spicy, meaty... mmmm!  My man had the lamb vidaloo, and that was equally spicy and soooo tasty.  I got the banana carmel graham dessert thing too.  OMG!!!  So freakin' great.  Awesome.  Unbelievable.  Not sure I did the crampdness of the place, we ordered our stuff to-go and will probably go this route in the future.  Yum.Yum.Yum."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town. It's something different that I think real \"Foodies\" will enjoy. Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it's worth going to over and over again.   I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty. But if you're ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive."}
{"text":"I've been too this place a couple of times. It's pretty delicious! The first time I went it took way too long to get our food, but it was still good. The next time I went, our food came out pretty good. The royale cheeseburger pasty is my favorite. Their caramel graham cracker banana pie is pretty good for dessert too! This place is very unique with a cool atmosphere. I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"A quick tip from another reviewer that I found helpful: PASTY rhymes with BLASTY. If you say \"PASTE-EE\", that's something else completely.   VEGAN REVIEW:  Wandering into Cornish Pasty from the bright AZ sun is a shock for the senses. I was momentarily blinded, because of how dark and dimly lit the restaurant was. After taking a minute for my eyes to adjust, I saw a couple empty tables and two waitstaff. I did not know this was a seat yourself kind of deal so my brother and I just stood at the doorway and waited for instruction. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress told us to seat ourselves.   We came around 2pm, so many of the vegan pasties had been sold out and I was left with the choice between the vindaloo and the greek flavored ones. Upon the waitress' recommendation, I went with the vindaloo. My brother and I also ordered the Oven-baked Chips to share.   The Vindaloo Pasty was spicy and filling, but probably not something I would order again. The vindaloo filling did not offer much excitement in the flavor department, and eating THAT much vindaloo filling was kind of monotonous. I really wish I came earlier so I could have more vegan options to chose from but my mistake is your benefit!   The pastry part of the pasty was delicious! It was crunchy and had a wonderful pastry flavor that is hard to describe. If they sold a pasty full of the pastry, I would buy that in a heartbeat! When comparing  my pasty to my brother's, I could tell they didn't glaze mine, which is a comforting to see because they probably used an egg wash.   The oven-baked chips were 10/10.They were crunchy, crispy, and satisfying. You can't go wrong with fresh baked fries/chips!  Overall, I would visit again (but earlier) to try more vegan pasties."}
{"text":"I am a die hard pasty fan and was dumbstruck with joy to find this place in the middle of downtown Phoenix!  The restaurant has a fabulous dark wood (but open air in front) ambience and enthusiastic in-character wait staff who seemed to love pasty as much as I do.  It was *so* hard to chose which one to order.  As I was in the Southwest, I opted for the southwestern style Carne Adovada with pork and chili peppers.  Yes, it sounds weird for a Pasty.  My reasoning was that if this was going to be good anywhere, it would be here in Phoenix.  And it was awesome!  Succulent pork, mildly spicy chilli peppers, with a small amount of rice and beans (hard to notice actually).  Really unusual to have a pastry crust over something like a burrito, but it worked.  In speaking with the server, I learned that this restaurant has other locations throughout the country, including one in Boston.  I may have to look into mail ordering from this place..."}
{"text":"How often do you see a pasty shop in US? I went to Cornish Pasty with a lot of expectations (since I'm a big lover of pasties). Maybe because of my high expectations, I found the pasties to be just good enough. The sticky toffee pudding was great though (again, how often do you see sticky toffee pudding on the menu!).  Service staff is very nice and friendly . Food takes forever to get."}
{"text":"One of the girls at work had her Tech go out for lunch for us.  I've never had pastry like this other than at faires back east.  She got the Mexican and also the Greek pastries and we shared both.  I really liked the Mexican a lot, it was delicious and had a good kick to it.  The Greek was also good, but I liked the Mexican a lot more.  Since this was a take out that was brought to us, I look forward to visiting the location in the near future.  I'm not too happy of where it's located, not the best part of town, but it will be worth going there."}
{"text":"Went there last night and decided to eat at the bar. We had such a great time with RJ the bartender. He was attentive and social. The food was great and ambiance was even better. If you want a hipster/fun restaurant the Cornish Pasty is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Holy cow how have I missed this place for over a year?  Remarkably in this little patch of Las Vegas it's hard to find a decent reasonably priced meal, especially after 9pm.   Cornish Pasty is a unique spot in the ArtsDistrict. A pasty is sort of like a Stromboli but much better as executed here. I'll be back often but for this review it's about carry out. The Chicken Pot Pie Pasty approaches metaphysical perfect and likewise the apple pie pasty. If they hadn't been out of some of the other items it would be a 5 star review.  Check out the extensive menu and if you're in the area stop in. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Good: Tasty pasties, creative flavors, and a casual vibe.  The Bad: Hipster prices. $9+ for a single pasty, no matter how filling, is slightly overpriced. Also, there was still leftover food crusted on one of our plates. And while I'm riding this gripe train, what's the point of bolting down your benches so damn close to the table?  Overall: The quality is there; the ambiance is appealing. Not really a huge \"wow\" experience for me, but a solid food choice nonetheless (for Arizona)."}
{"text":"Love them. Go there all the time. The food is always amazing. I always make sure to take out of town guests there. The unfiltered blood orange cider was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The food is heavy, not especially tasty, and the interior is very dark. Lots of people like this place and I've never figured out exactly why."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from first bite to last. For a first time experience it was amazing. My fiance and I are always looking for local places to check out and we enjoyed it so much we've decided to turn this into a weekly date night for ourselves!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 5 and luckily we were able to sit in back.  The place is small and bad for groups.  Aside from that the food is awesome and the beer is cheap!    I grew up on pastys in Wisconsin, my Dad's would be called a beef stew pasty.  The variations this place has is awesome.  Good stuff!  Go!"}
{"text":"Attention Yoopers: this is not just the best Pasty shop in Vegas, these are downright the best pasties that I've had at a restaurant. For those of you wondering what a \"yooper\" is, it's a person from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and we all LOVE pasties (pronounced: \"Pass-tee\", not to be confused with the \"pay-stews\" that you might find at many other establishments in Vegas.   Critiques: there is only one pastie, and it is the Oggie. All others are delicious counterfeits. Additional critique: they'll try to serve your Pasty with gravy, but all Yoopers know it's eaten with ketchup, there is no other way."}
{"text":"Alright, first I thought it was pastRy with an R. Then I was corrected and told that it was paste-y like the skin. Now I find out it's past-ee. Lol I'll never get the name right, but regardless, this place is so good.   Don't let the run down plaza deter you from trying this place. It's right next to Komol with tons of parking so you can't miss it. Upon walking in, it's in the darker side but your eyes adjust eventually. There's little tables for the more intimate date, a bar to enjoy a few drinks and large tables with church pews to accommodate large groups. The skinny menu has a history lesson on the origin of the pasty. I felt more knowledgable after reading it. The menu has a large variety of pasties with or without meat, appetizers and a long beer list. You'll be reading it for a while.   So far, I've tried one pasty with meat (pesto chicken) and one without meat (eggplant parmesan) and both have been delicious. They really put some thought as to what ingredients would taste good wrapped together with dough. And they did an amazing job. They are made fresh to order so they come out super hot so be careful. The crust is buttery and flaky. They are packed full so don't expect to finish the whole thing unless you're really hungry. Both times I've had to take the other half home for lunch the next day. You have to try this place ASAP. The next one on my list is the asiago chicken! Can't wait.   P.S. Get the banana bread beer if it's available. You'll thank me later:)"}
{"text":"My banger & mash Cornish pasty win gravy was amazing. It took a while to come out, but I was content with drinking the Kronenberg 1664 while we waited. Staff were nice, and I will be back to try the royals, the pilgrim amongst other pasties."}
{"text":"Great hot pockets and beer!  I don't know what pasties are but the best way to describe them is gourmet hot pockets or calzone.  The menu offers many different kinds of pasties - steak, pork, lamb, Italian, meatball, Mexican, veggies, etc for about $10.  They also have soups, salads and sides.  This place was already busy around 5pm on a weeknight.  The place was big on the inside and very dark.  Service was friendly and fast.  There's happy hour daily between 3p-6p where you can save $1 off draft beer, wine and liquor.  Four Peaks - $6 for 20oz local beer.  Light and refreshing. Vindaloo Lamb $11 - Tasty and slightly spicy. Oggie $9.25 - Delicious steaks and potatoes! I like the side of gravy that came with it.  Easy parking in the strip mall parking lot.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"WOW!! My Mom used to make us pasty's when we were kids, unfortunatley they were never this good! The Bangers and Mash was excellent, M\my wife had the Shepards Pie which she loved! You can never go wrong here with the beer/cider choices, Strongbow & Boddingtons on tap. I will definately return."}
{"text":"Reasons Why I Love CPC:  GREAT FOOD GREAT PRICES GREAT ATMOSPHERE NICE STAFF DELIVERY!!   I had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.    The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency.    Another time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch.     I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus.    My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.     To be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner.    Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING!   Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well.    They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!   Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did."}
{"text":"The place felt like what I imagine a Vampire den would be like.  The interior was dark and dreary with a low black painted drop ceiling and black curtains covering the windows. I thought the black lace curtains were especially creepy. Old church pew benches need some serious upholstery work. The glass light over our table was broken and dusty. it wasn't one of the newer fixtures but one of the old ones that hangs just above eye level. all this accentuated with some very deep hard 70s and 80s rock music with some pretty amazing guitar riffs but very odd for a restaurant. The restrooms during our visit were completely ignored by the staff as they were dirty, and unattended for probably hours in a busy restaurant. They are also ignored by the owners and managers because of broken fixtures like paper towel and TP dispensers bad paint and lighting and a lot of graffiti.  Service was ok, took orders brought food, that's it. there were 11 empty glasses on the table when our party of 4 left. Maybe managers can find a better way to get a side of lemon slices to the table as mine arrived on a plastic drink lid.  The bacon wrapped meatballs arrived hot and greasy, they tasted fine, but I had to re think my salad order when I notice only 3 poorly chopped pieces of browning romaine lettuce that was used to garnish under the caldron that held the meatballs.  All of the pasties looked smaller then I remember and so was my Greek salad, Maybe I am just spoiled by the \"Scottsdale\" location but the salad bowl was tiny and deep and chipped. It was also the first time in many orders that I thought I never want to order that again. We almost always start with one, but this time I ordered my own.  This growing chain has garnered kudos, admiration and recommendations from me plenty of times, so I am aware that it can be great, but in this case the older child has been neglected and run amuck."}
{"text":"13 of us..(British Ladies in Vegas) went last night.I tried to book because there were a few of us but they don't take reservations.Everything I wanted to drink was out of stock.But amazingly the cider I wanted suddenly appeared for a group of regulars!A lot of the pasties we ordered were off the menu,including all of the Vegan ones.We waited an hour and a half for our food,and it was difficult to get a drink!The food was ok and the waiter was a dick.Also the smell outside is horrendous!We meet every month for lunch/dinner,but we certainly wont be going back or recommending it.I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the hype. I had lamb vindaloo and it was meh. Just meat and potatoes. I might be willing to go back and try something different, because 800 Yelp reviewers can't all be wrong. But if I went here without seeing the awesome reviews, I would probably never return. I was expecting something spectacular and was disappointed. The service was also extremely slow. The waitress barely came around and that always makes the experience suck."}
{"text":"OK.  Never even heard of these things before, but man I wish I had.  ate the Guiness pot pie one and, wow, it was perfect.  Had it with 2 guiness beers.  Yep, it was just right in all the right ways."}
{"text":"Delicious pasties! I'm still stuffed from our lunch here today but the food was so good that I kept eating and eating.   Atmosphere: the place is actually really big inside so lots of seating. We were seated at a small table right away. I think it's converted garage or warehouse and they've brought in what looks like church pews for seating at big wooden banquet style tables in one portion of the restaurant so good for small and large groups. The bar is in the middle with wrap around seating and they also have table shuffleboard so a little entertainment as well while you're waiting for food. :)  Dining: the food was so good. I mean, I was with a British guy so the bar is set high with him when it comes to pasties, and he likes their pasties so that says a lot. I had the Shepard pie pasty, he had the classic (steak, veggies, gravy, etc) and we shared meatballs (wrapped in bacon), chips (French fries), and he had a liver pate with bread. So a lot! The meatballs were really well flavored, the pasty filling (lamb) and seasoning was perfect. Oh, the cocktail I had was delish (passion fruit something or other).   Service: we were seated right away, our waiter was nice and how he remembered all we ordered is beyond me. It was busy so he was really busy so I'd say the good came just slightly on the slow side but I really say that lightly because it's a busy place and he seemed to be juggling a lot so kudos to him.   Anyway, give this place a try! I don't think anyone would not like it!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix- regardless of the location. Each location has its own spirit and draw, but no matter which one you go to you're going to get amazing squishy soft bread with your soup, and a crispy buttery pasty of one of dozens of varieties. In the many years I've been going to CP, my favorites have shifted from the tikka masala to the lamb vindaloo to the eggplant parm; the fillings are super creative! Come to the new downtown location for some free pool upstairs. Oh! And don't forget dessert. I'm not a fan of banana but if you ask they will sub strawberry on the banoffi pie (Strawnoffi anyone?). Amazing. I go out of my way to make CP a part of my plans when I drive up from Tucson."}
{"text":"A year later, and they're still so good...filling for cheap.  And I just discovered their desserts!  I love that you can purchase them half baked; I was able to take their tasty PB&J to enjoy back home in CA.     I'd still recommend calling in for take out, since they do take awhile to bake.  But it's all worth it."}
{"text":"England! I was meeting a friend for dinner and I was trying to thing of an appropriate place. A former co-worker, one of the project that we did together was to built the Current TV UK facility (mostly in London's Bloomsbury but also in Southampton area) and though that having some pies with a pint would be a great way to reminisced.  This place was perfect. Good choice of beers and pies (in the traditional style but also in the Cornwall style of pasties, which is their specialty). The place is very friendly with tables laid around a large bar.  It is located in \"Commercial Center District\" which is a weird and rundown collection of strip malls but once you go over the psychological shock and come inside, you'll feel just like in England and will have a great time!  Food is very good (well, this is english food, so try to put it in perspective) and service is convivial."}
{"text":"Exceptional beer selection.  Wide variety of pasty options.  Music is spot on with anything from alternative/blues/classic rock.  Clean and well kept this place is casual date suitable.  I haven't had a pasty I didn't like."}
{"text":"This is the best place to visit for food or fun in downtown, the \"pasties\" are amazing, aptly describes as giant hot pockets, but SO MUCH better! Try the royal with cheese l, or the pilgrim, can't go wrong, friendly staff (especially Jessa) service with a smile, and a great selection on tap, you will not regret stopping here for lunch, I promise!"}
{"text":"Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative.   If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality.   Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean.   I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites.   Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.  If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.    After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.   Edit (4/30/2014):  Food's still good... but...    The service has gone down hill. What was once a staff of edgy, unique, and skilled individuals. They are now mostly pretentious hipsters, with a bad attitude and below standard skills at basic service."}
{"text":"Love that the Mesa location is close to home, plus open late on weeknights!  I want to echo the positive things said about the food, as well as the service - very friendly, helpful, and efficient. I usually get my pasty to go, but may have to hang out sometime at the Mesa shop.  They've got a lot more space than the original Tempe store, interior's stylish, porch has lots of seating, and they offer a very respectable beer selection."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe. For under 10 dollars you can get a good meal that will fill you up and it tastes delicious as well. I've been here around 5 times and I always try to get something different than my last visit. If it's your first time at this place I suggest you go with the original Oggie. So far I've tried the Oggie, the Italian, the Meat and Cheese, Bangers and Mash, the Reuben, I can't even remember them all.  But you won't be disappointed with this place, the food is consistently good every visit. The only drawback about this place is that it's pretty small."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week. Parking can be a challenge, but if you plan ahead you wont be completely annoyed by it. We sat downstairs in what once was Monroe's bar. I had the cajun chicken pasty and broccoli cheese side and chips. My pasty was really good, I didn't really like the ham in it, but it was still good. I tried to have it excluded but since the pasty takes time to make, they are not able to modify what is listed on the menu. We had great service and loved the dark speakeasy feel of the downstairs of the restaurant. I will definitely be back for more. Oh and the most important part, they have coke products!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Beer and bread, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"As far as pasties go, this place is the f*ckin' sh*t.  Sorry, I didn't know I was so passionate about pasties, or really what the hell a pasty was before I Yelped this joint for lunch.  Thank the pasty gods I did too because if my gullet could have handled the gastric barrage I would have eaten half a dozen of these delicious meat/cheese/veggie filled wonderlands.   If you're a regular, I'm jealous of your uninhibited access to CPC.  If you've never been, allow my review to sway you.  Go, enjoy and don't let the blacked out storefront, dive-y atmosphere, or bearded culinary artisans dissuade you, you will thank me."}
{"text":"New, bigger but Better?  Gone are the days of long waits to sit in a subway car's width to dine, the next two store fronts and patio are now part of the cornishpasty co.   As time goes on some this place move a bit more upscale, lighting so dim I was blind for the firs Prices have gone up about a dollar or two since the early days.   One thing that has not changed is the great pasties."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The atmosphere is nice too, when you sit at the counter you can watch them cook. Its the best place to go in the winter too. Nice cold beer and a hot pasty. *drool*"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here. The food is amazing. The atmosphere is cool but parking is a pain. That's the case is most of downtown Tempe though so no surprise here. I am so glad they expanded because the original layout was tiny. The expansion is awesome! Also love their Mesa location."}
{"text":"You have a lot of choices when it comes to food in Tempe but Cornish Pasty has been a staple of the area for years. There's a reason why they're one of the best reviewed restaurants in Tempe.   You might also notice their success has them expanding to multiple locations. It takes awhile for these new locations to find their legs, but Tempe is the original Pasty that started it all. An excellent staff and unique atmosphere compliment some of the best food you're likely to find in the area.  Oh, and they have an extensive assortment of beers on tap, many imported. They treat the beer with respect here, ensuring every pint is served up fresh. It sounds gross, but many restaurants don't properly take care of the hoses that connect the beer to the tap -- you end up with half your beer sitting outside of the refrigeration and going stale. Pasty's staff make sure everything is fresh like any proper bar -- something unique for a restaurant to do.  My personal favorites include the Cajun Chicken, Tikka, Meat and Cheese and the Royale. Honestly, order anything off the menu and you really can't go wrong.  Make sure if you order chips to ask the server for the 'wild' style, which includes baked garlic and fresh jalapenos. Adds an amazing kick."}
{"text":"The thing with Las Vegas is that if you wander off of the strip, you feel like you're probably a couple of wrong turns away from being in the background of an episode of COPS. This is kind of a drag, because a bit of exploration can result in finding some great places to eat.  Anyone who's set up shop in this particular strip mall owes kickback to both internet foodies and Lotus of Siam. No tourists are going to come to this area and stick around unless they've got the safety of the herd to assuage their fears. There's nothing rational about pulling into a place that houses an Adult Day Care center, several seedy karaoke bars, and other storefronts that look unsavory enough that if someone told you they were a swingers' club or a brothel, you would absolutely take them at their word.  The owners of the place seem to understand that the internet is basically the hand that feeds them, so they advertise a free beer if you check in. Good on them.   Cornish Pasty Co. is catty-corner to the front door of Lotus of Siam. If you exit Lotus and look out the front, it's the first shop in that closest line of shops on your left. (Two stores further up is a Thai food place whose passive-aggressive call out to potential customers reads, \"You'll Never Know If You Don't Try It.\" I find that I cannot argue with this statement...)  Seating inside consists of a few tables, a few benches, and seats at the bar. This was a British-style eatery, so I opted for the bar. We ordered some draft beers and appetizers. My friend opted for the Scotch egg, I went with the oven-baked chips with garlic, and the third member of our group for the oven-baked red potatoes.  You can probably safely pass on both of the potato products and not feel like you missed out on anything. The Scotch egg, however, what pretty awesome. Sausage and eggs are great, sausage and hardboiled eggs are also great. Unlike other places I've had this, they serve the egg quartered which makes it much easier to eat and enjoy.  I opted with the Meat & Cheese pasty, which is sausage and cheese inside a pastry shell. I love pretty much all pies, meat or otherwise, and this was no different. The red wine gravy was an excellent, rich complement to the pasty. I might consider bringing an ice chest the next time I'm up here and getting a couple to take back to California.  Filling, reasonably priced, and delicious. These big fancy-pants celebrity-chef Strip restaurants are looking less and less interesting every time I swing by Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"Good, very good comfort food. We had a cup of leek and potato soup with fresh bread and followed that by splitting a pastie. Yum. The atmosphere is friendly and the food is delicious, The waitstaff is young and efficient. We liked it so much we went back the week after and I had a vegetarian Greek, artichokes and really good olives. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I know Phoenix isn't known for their Pastys but this place is so freakin amazing I think it could put us on the Pasty map!"}
{"text":"Food was soooo good, love this place. The staff is friendly and always helpful."}
{"text":"Everything here is awesome! Try the Red Queen cocktail. My husband and I split The Oggie pasty and it was awesome! The crust and the gravy were so good! The mushy peas and oven chips..awesome! Chocolate bread pudding... Amazing!! They play my favorite music too! The Smiths, The Cure..."}
{"text":"Got the adobado pastie , lots of flavor really good. Also got the Greek half salad, was delicious, and a good size. Next time I'll get one or the other,  sufficient to fill me up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the shepherd or sheep herder's pie it was phenominal!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Beers and pasties are great. Service is fabulous. Desserts to die for. Don't think, just go!"}
{"text":"I was living in Cali and my BF in Arizona.. My BF and friends took me here on my first visit to AZ and I was afraid I wouldn't be a fan... I was SO wrong. And, once I ate their if I found out they went without me (after I had gone back to Cali) I would get so upset!  The location and exterior is very unassuming, actually you might miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. It's tucked between a discount bread store and an Italian place in a slightly run down little strip mall. Initially, when you walk in it doesn't get much better... Its a hallway basically with about 8 tables that seat 2, 2 tables that seat four and a table all the way in the back that will seat 6-8. They also have about 14 seats at the bar. It's dark and in the summer it's WaRm too.   But, once you grab a table (it can take time on a Fri or Sat night) you are in for some good eats.   I love The Porky, Bangers & Mash & Carne Adovada. BF loves the Lamb & Mint. Friends of ours typically go for The Cottage Pie, Royale with Cheese or the Greek Chicken. Typically we stay with the \"traditional pasties\", but I recently tried the Carne Adovada (considered a premium pasty) and it rocks. So, BASICALLY we've never been disappointed.   And the red wine gravy that they serve on the side... Yeah, I could drink it (you will want to too).   And while there are a TON of pastys to choose from... at least once you have to order their pasta salad (order it w/ chicken). Spinach, bow tie pasta, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, onions, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and chicken tossed in a yummy pesto vinaigrette.  This is a spot that we always hit early on a Sat or Sun... rarely are we interested in braving the Fri night crowd... And, don't go with more than 4 people unless you want to sit at the bar.  Hard Cider and a pasty... my perfect Sunday afternoon.  *I was torn on giving the CPC 4 or 5 stars because of their ti-ny seating capacity... but it adds to the character of the place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Hearty portions (I can't finish half my meal). Delicious food and great atmosphere. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Super tucked away. But search and you will find. This place is so cute and never disappoints. They have some brews to choose from which are pretty darn good... and I don't even like beer! What I go for is the food! It's different, has a some mining history and you won't regret stopping in."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. It's in the same shopping complex as Lotus of Siam so I could never hit it up as long as Lotus was open. Last Sunday night, it was on. The place was small and seemed more bar than restaurant. The vibe was trendy, \"hipsterry\" and industrial which translates to the chairs being a bit uncomfortable.   We were in the mood for some serious meat pie and my husband ordered the Meat and Cheese pasty which has pork, sausage, cheddar and swiss cheeses. I went with the Cheese Steak pasty. We ordered a side of mushy peas but they were out. Out of mushy peas?! Sacrilege! They must bake the items to order because the wait for our food felt pretty long. Definitely longer than 20 minutes. When the food finally arrived, I was surprised by how large the portions were. The steak in my pasty was flavorful and the pie was piping hot. The crust was dense enough to hold all the filling yet flaky on the outside.  We decided to end our meal with tea and dessert. We ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. The toffee pudding was the undisputed winner of the two and we should've gotten two of that instead. At the end, the meal was pretty cheap and the pies were delicious but were definitely too heavy for me to crave as a regular meal. Not a lot of places in Vegas that serve legit pie and the Cornish Pasty Co. satisfies."}
{"text":"Came to the Cornish Pasty, by the looks of the outside, knew instantly it was the type of English dive I would love. Once inside seen the tattoo'ed waitresses, cooks, and bar tenders and knew this place was way above my expectations. Once I looked over the menu, which is extensive, had to decide on a meal. Went with the Shepard's Pie, made with minted ground lamb, veggies, and mashed potatoes, inside a pastry. Crazy I know, but absolutely fantastic. Staff was attentive and wanted to make sure my experience was great. Definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What's a pasty? G-d-like predesessor of the hot pocket! CPC is a great place for carnivores, omnivores, and veggies alike (probably vegans as well). They offer a huge menu ranging from Indian- inspired pasties to more traditional English versions. It's difficult, but save room for desert! There have been many stressful nights when all I wanted was to trade my periodic table and graphing calculator in for one of their apple caramel pasties. I have also heard wonderful things about the Strawberry Pavlova and the Banoffee Pie."}
{"text":"This location has been recently remodeled, I think it could still use some more work as their Mesa location is so much nicer but the food makes up for it.  The only downside, is the pasty take a little while to bake, but just sit back, relax, and sip down on a beer or any other drink from their bar, a local gem."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I went in expecting  traditional style pasties and maybe a few other items on the menu.  I was surprised to see the variety of different pasties they have, everything from chicken curry pasty to their Thanksgiving themed \"Pilgrim\" pasty.  I tried the Pilgrim and Rosemary Chicken pasties, and both were excellent.  I'll definitely go back and try some more when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"The food is really, really tasty. I got the Pilgrim, because I love Thanksgiving dinner, and it did not disappoint. The cranberry sauce for dipping was a perfect touch. And it was super filling. When ordering, the waitress told us it didn't come with any sides - we thought it was kind of weird, so two of our group ordered some fries for the side. As it turned out, the pasty was deceptively small looking and was actually incredibly hearty. I could barely finish it and I had hardly any of the fries. Sides really aren't necessary!  The major downside, and the reason for 4 stars, is the rather uncomfortable interior. I don't really mind that it's dark or grungy, but my main complaint was how loud it was. The music was so loud, my dinner mates and I could barely carry on a conversation since we had to basically shout to be heard. I suppose if you're drinking and being loud anyway it's not too bad, but otherwise it's not the best place to actually eat there. In the future I'll stick to take out."}
{"text":"My friend out of state was visiting and just landed from her plane ride. She requested for filling food and we were looking at a few \"New American\" places downtown.There so many new options for restaurants these days but most of them are tapas style or mediocre food. Then I thought of Cornish Pasty.   This place is for those people who want delicious filling food but don't want to try anything \"ethnic\". The flavors of their food are familiar but always done well and if you get one of their pasties then you'll be sure to leave fulfilled. They also have a great beer selection to add to their \"new pub\" ambiance.   This restaurant isn't new but it's in a plaza that's often forgotten even though it's filled with amazing restaurants."}
{"text":"What a pity that the words pasty and tasty don't exactly rhyme despite the spellings, and despite the fact that Cornish pasty is so fkn tasty! The word \"pasty\" (in the context of Cornish pasty) rhymes with the U.S. pronunciation of the word \"nasty\" (how perverse is that!).   Traditional or non-traditional, authentic or otherwise, I have enjoyed every one of the pasties I've tried here. My favorite among the savory pasties is the cottage pie pasty. Well, is it even possible to go wrong with seasoned ground beef, mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, carrots and peas all stuffed into a buttery, flaky pie? I think not.  The chicken tikka masala pasty contains diced potatoes and green peppers (not what you'd expect in chicken tikka masala) along with curried chicken.   The sweet pasties are great, but they are a rather large portion for dessert. The sticky toffee pudding is some of the best I've ever had.   The interior of the restaurant is very dark. Not sure what kind of effect the owners were going for, but whatever it was, it was completely lost on me.   The Cornish Pasty Company started in the Phoenix area, and has expanded into cities like Las Vegas and Boston. I'm just waiting for them to come to New York City!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I adore this place. The vibe is excellent, the food is to die for, and the dim candlelit lighting just makes for the perfect ambiance. It's so... comfortable in there, but in the best way. Now, my husband isn't the biggest fan. His complaints are that the benches are hard and uncomfortable and he doesn't like that you sit with others, but hey, you win some you lose some, and I think Cornish Pasty is winning! (say that like Charlie Sheen and it makes it 10x better)"}
{"text":"This place was recommended. By a friend it's super cool dark punk steam decor. Waitress was very friendly we had the scotch egg as an appetizer and it was okay nothing special. I had the Pilgrim Pasty it's thanksgiving in a Pasty it was amazing I definitely come back again"}
{"text":"First time here after hearing great things.  It didn't disappoint.  DH had the Bangers and mash I had Cottage Pie.  Both were excellent.  Perfectly brown and flaky crust.  But the Apple pastry dessert definitely finished off.  If I could go for a bottle of cider and apple pastry I would have left Happy!!!  Will definitely go back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of pasties and great selection of craft beers. This is definitely a cool place to entertain some guests visiting from out of town or just to hangout for date night."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. Real cozy and busy. The people were really cool and the food was great."}
{"text":"Great food! Atmosphere was still lively and comfortable at 1am. They have several floors and seating areas for different ambiance. Food and service was on point!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Basically they serve gourmet hot pockets in a very cool environment.  These things are awesome.  I don't get to go here enough, but I get the Pilgrim when I do!  I am not a beer guy, but it seems like they have a great selection."}
{"text":"Hail the Pasty.  This place rocks so much I can't even put it into words.  It is definitely one of the places in the entire valley that I recommend to travelers.  Everything is made right there, in front of you almost.  Their selection is vast and pretty much everything is awesome... I suggest the Reuben.  Desserts are good, check out the banofee pie.  Hoegaarden on tap plus others, and the kicker $3 car bombs all day everyday.   We have a winner.  This spot is legit!"}
{"text":"Never had a pasty before. What a treat! Hot, crispy crust. Young hipster vibe, but music from the 79's we loved. Great service. Eat on the patio- loved the ambiance!"}
{"text":"When I first started researching some food options for my trip to Arizona, Cornish Pasty Company kept popping up. At first I tried to ignore it, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. So many rave reviews about this  'glorified hot pocket'. I'm thinking, yes I like hot pockets, but I don't know if I could take that affinity to the restaurant level.   Cornish Pasty Company happened to be literally less than a mile from our hotel so we had to check it out. We got there right before the dinner rush and barely waited for a seat at the bar. I decided on the chicken tikka masala and the bf got the peppered steak. He was intrigued by the bleu cheese. We were both happy with our orders. There is a decent wait from the time you order, but just think of every minute going towards a perfectly baked pasty. Now I understand how people can compare it to a hot pocket. This is the epitome of hot pockets and I can't find the words to a description that justifies how good it is.   Our waitress and the kitchen guy we chatted up were both suuuper nice. The waitress was very attentive and quick. The place itself is pretty dark (literally, dim lighting) and has that euro dive bar feel to it. I enjoyed sitting at the bar, feeling like a local and watching the kitchen staff work those ovens.   The food alone would have gotten me to love them. To top it off, they have THREE DOLLAR irish car bombs!!! Their receipt even says \"IRISH CAR BOMB... F... YEAH\" haha, they definitely know what's up.   No doubt I'll be back for more the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A few of us from work went here for lunch one day. What a treat! Cornish Pasty is a small little place, but the food is just the opposite. Each of our dishes was more than we could eat in one sitting. I had the Cajun Chicken Pasty and it was perfect! Not too spicy, full of bacon and the side of chipotle was amazing! Totally worth more than the $8 for size and deliciousness!  The staff was super friendly and once we sat down, they were right there to take our order. The wait time was pretty short. However, we got there at around 11:30am, and by noon there were no more seats available. Obviously the rest of Tempe knows just how great this place is. So if you want a seat, be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait. If you do wait though, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night with a big group for a friends birthday.  I've never had a pasty before and didn't know what to expect but it turns out it was one of the most delicious things I'll ever put in my mouth. My boyfriend and I shared the Bangers & Mash and a Chicken Pot Pie. So amazing. The service was also awesome! We sat on the patio and Jill was our server.  She was attentive, made awesome food and beer suggestions, brought tons of samples, and a free birthday shot for our friend. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, when I walked in I had no idea what to expect. It was dark and very subdue. The waitress was very friendly and took our order promptly. Once your eyes adjusts to the darkness its not bad at all. The food arrived quickly and was nice and fresh.   I ordered the \"Bangers and Mash\" and my wife ordered the \"Shepherds Pie\". We ended up splitting them so we could both try half of the other. I have to say it was really really good. The crust in which the \"pies\" are baked in are flaky and tasty.   I slightly preferred the \"Bangers and Mash\" (Homemade pork with sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, & an extra side of gravy.) over the \"Shepherd's Pie\" (Ground minted lamb or seasoned ground beef, with peas & carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and cheddar. With a side of red wine gravy) But she got it with the ground beef instead of the minted lamb so that might have made a difference.   All in all my only regret was I did not save room for dessert, well next time, and yes there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 34/100  Came here on a Wednesday night to find this place not too crowded. There are people at the bar area and at the upstairs game area as well.   My boyfriend and I say down and ordered. There weren't too many tables but we still waited over 30 minutes to get our food. It was 9 pm when we sat down so needless to say we were pretty hangry by the time the food finally came.   Service was ok, food was ok. What's so special about this place? Its like blaze except they need to bake the pastry a bit more."}
{"text":"If I could, I would eat here everyday.  The pasties are amazing, the beer selection is quality and the atmosphere is unique, in a great way."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best dive spots in Tempe.  Its hard to find but its awesome.  You wont be let down."}
{"text":"Cool spot. I was a little sketch when it was in a strip mall, but we gave it a shot anyway. We were greeted promptly after walking in, and we're sat immediately. Jill, our server, gave some awesome recommendations on which pasty's to try. We got the Masala, and the Lamb Shepherds pie. Both were excellent. Full of flavor. I can't wait to come try the others. I just moved to the area and this is definitely a repeat spot. Service was on point. Price was too low for the quality. I would've paid more. Give it a shot if you want some old fashioned English pasty's."}
{"text":"Delicious patsy pockets o'love that will leave you enchanted and sick with desire.  A true Las Vegas gem."}
{"text":"I went for the first time last night and what a cool place. Nice dark atmosphere where you can hangout with friends and have great food!! The potato and leek soup was phenomenal... I also tried the Oggie Pasty and it was awesome!!! This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I went to CPC with my husband for lunch, we had a Spicy Asiago Chicken & a Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, with a beer each. We liked the draft selection, it was nice to have kronenbourg 1664 on tap. We both enjoyed, it and are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"OMG. The pasties are SO DAMN GOOD. I have been twice and have yet to deviate from my regular order of the Thanksgiving pasty (I think that's the name of it). Turkey, sweet potatoes and stuffing in a pasty, served with the yummiest gravy. They also give you a side of cranberry for the ultimate Thanksgiving experience. Their homemade lemonade is delish...Like Hot Dog on a Stick delish. The service can be slow (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars), so don't go if you are really hungry. Last time I went I ordered the tomato soup. It came to my table cold, but tasted delicious. They also have a large selection of beer, which I recommend because it leaves more lemonade for me!"}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty is sort of my go-to place when I have friends coming in from out of town and I want to take them somewhere fun.  Almost all of my friends give me the \"Duh\" face when I recommend we go eat at the Cornish Pasty.  \"What's a cornish pasty?\"  If I had a nickel for each time I heard that question asked, I'd have enough money to... I dunno, I'd at least have enough money to buy a 40 of Mickey's.  Or a can of Sparks.  There are so many different pasties you can choose.  Everything from Mexican to Greek to traditional American fare to the classic bangers and mash British faves.  And they're all good.  A lot of their better ingredients are homemade.  Each pasty has love baked right into its flaky crust.  I don't each there as much as I used to, mostly because I sort of exhausted myself, but I love bringing friends so I can relive my experience of the first time I went there.  Everyone else has pretty much already said it, but this is absolutely one of the best places to go eat.  If you've never been, you should really go.  The food is great, the beer is great and the whole atmosphere is so damn jolly you can't help but, at the very least, enjoy yourself with friends for the night.  Quite legitimately, this is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"We stopped here looking for something different.  Everything was excellent.  The ploughman's platter appetizer was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with great food.  The orders are huge and I suggest sharing a meal.  The ingredients are fresh and it's all top notch from start to end.  Eat here"}
{"text":"Love this spot! And the food is amazing! I always try to order something new when I come here and have not had one bad pasty! The upstairs area has become one of my favorite places to hangout with friends and grab a drink and play some pool! Definitely worth checking out this downtown location!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted to love this place. My mom used to make us beef pasty's as a kid and I really wanted to love it. I was SUPER disappointed. I got the roast beef pasty and it took forever to arrive. Which was ok, I figured it takes a while to cook one, however, when it did arrive it was just warm. I expected it to be piping hot, as a fresh baked pasty should be.  I assume it was ready but sat waiting to be brought out and cooked off.  I would have sent it back but didn't have time. I didn't care for the red wine gravy, would have preferred a basic brown gravy. I will try it again and probably just get a more basic pasty. So bummed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Unique atmosphere and tons of options as far as I pasties go. Really good food and layed back service/atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay. I'm angry.  -1 Star (For being cross)  Food is simply not supposed to be this savory, this delicious, this damn fine.  - 1 Star (Cornish Pasty is too good)  Meat/gravy/vegis that comes wrapped in a golden crust is simply not legal. I had something called the \"Cottage Pasty\".  -1 Star (Golden crust legality issue)  I noticed that on the menu, there was no chance that they'd make Pasty boxing gloves for me to wear, and punch my own face with this delectable treat. This is a problem for me, as I'd like to have their food around my face in greater quantities.  - 1 Star (No Pasty boxing gloves on menu.)  I feel that dark wizards got together to create this unnatural feast. It must be unholy food, as these pasties should not be this desirable and fabulous.  - 1 Star (Dark magics and too tasty ingredients)  However, if this establishment were to ever disappear from my locality, I would throw myself off of the tallest castle that I could find, while yelling \"for the PASTY!!!!!\".  +5 Stars (Please never stop.)"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is love, Cornish Pasty is life.   What other place has so many delicious options for vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters alike? Since I'm a vegetarian, I often have to settle for salads or unfulfilling meals when I go out to eat with my friends. But that's never the problem at Cornish Pasty! My absolute favorite there is the Veggie Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty. Although all the Veggie options I've tried have been just extraordinary! Thank you, CP for all that you do. Be back in soon for more delicious times!"}
{"text":"The bartenders were all on one side of the bar. It took over 15 minute's to get a drink. When a bartender did tell me that he would be with me in a second, it took a couple more minutes for the different bartender to take and fill my order. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"There's three things I love: good food, beer and cool people. All are in abundance at Cornish Pasty.  This was my fourth visit to this location and I can't wait to keep coming back to try new items on the menu.  The service is always great and consistent every time I go here.  Attentive, yet not overbearing.  Friendly, but not in an ass-kissing kind of way.  I dig the food and their style.  Located in Commercial Center right next to the other \"famous\" Thai restaurant.  I keep joking that this place merely serves fancy Hot Pockets. While that may be true it's leaps and bounds above what you may remember having as a kid. Nothing frozen and microwaved here. These bad boys are hand made from scratch right in front of you after placing your order. Part science, part art, with a dash of love gets you some of the best pastry-filled goodness that will ever cross your lips. Don't let the perceived size fool you, these things are very filling and if you order a side you're likely going to need a to-go box.  I re-heated my last order the next day at home and it still tasted fantastic.  Great food, a unique beer selection, cool people and a really nice atmosphere all for a low cost.  My meal is typically no more than 20 bucks with one beer.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great spot for vegetarians!! I got the mock chicken and rosemary and it was fantastic!! Fun environment and a great selection of beers on tap. It's definitely not the healthiest I will say that."}
{"text":"Did you know this 3rd location opened?!  I didn't until I walked by their sidewalk cart. Wow, what a great idea. Take your pasty on the go just like they were originally intended.  Yes, I ate mine in the car while driving back to work.  Also, did you know that they have a vegan version that is AMAZING? Thank you Cornish, I really appreciated this today!  The only complaint was the $15 it cost from essentially a sidewalk card for a pasty and tea. Just a little high in my opinion."}
{"text":"I do not visit Phoenix often, but when I get the chance, I would always come by here. If I were to live here, then I would go here quite as often as I go eat Korean BBQ. I'd say its one places to visit if you are in Phoenix if you're interested in meat pies!  Parking: You can find parking in the back, and enter from the back although it does not look like an entrance. Someone will notice you and seat you.   Environment/ Service: The ambiance is casual and dark inside. They were attentive and had our order out in an orderly fashion.   Food: I don't know if I can recommend any filling because there is a good list of different kinds of pasties I still have not tried yet, and so far the ones I have tried are all delicious in its own way. I have tried the chicken pot pie, the peppered steak, and oggie. I like their filling to crust ratio. I hate to not get enough filling, but here,  get full off of the filling because the outer crust is thin, crisp, and not soggy."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see another taste from Michigan making it's way to the valley.  I like to describe to people a pasty as a slightly harder calzone with meat and potatoes stuffed inside of it.  If you can think of a winter food which can warm your soul, this is it!  The thing which makes Cornish Pasty unique is pure selection.  You can get the original style, or get the pasty stuffed with a whole slew of offerings with sides.  (The price range is roughly $9 on average).  Personally my original style pasty did not taste as good as what I've had in Michigan (where the treat is popular as far as the US goes), but it was still really good.  What will keep me coming back is trying all of the combinations on the menu, I'm sure there is a 5-star winner in there!  The desert menu also looked very good, I ended with a PB&J pasty, it was very gooey on the inside and the scoop of ice cream complimented it nicely.  They also have an apple pasty and some sort of banana pie treat.  Once again i will be back!  If you are a Vegas foodie, you'll recognize the area from Lotus of Siam, is it nice brand spanking new Summerlin? No, but the location near the strip and surrounding neighborhoods makes for a very easy in and out.  The inside is very nice, not too small, but not too big with low lighting.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Try a pasty!  If you're a beer drinker, they have a nice selection. The setting is small and cozy. Another favorite with us locals!"}
{"text":"Every time I go in I find something new that is my favorite. This time it was the bread and butter..unghhh. Must get every visit, now. Also the broccoli/cauliflower bake is a must get. Any pasty you choose will be a winner. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"The ambience and the service provided is very good. The beer that they serve here is great and with the food my personal favourites are Cream of Leek - Potato soup and Veggie Mexican Pasty!!  Do visit this restaurant when you're at Tempe and you'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good things can come from Arizona!  Flaky bread pockets filled with meats, cheeses, and veggies. Served piping hot, we get it Cornish Pasty, your food is on another level! Their new location has ample seating, a full bar, a great local beer selection and awesome ambiance. The cold industrial look fits the British feel, but not the food served which is filled with warm, bright, flavorul happiness.   First time here? I recommend the Royale with Cheese, or my nickname for it, \"The American Wet Dream.\" This Hot-Pocket on steroids is filled with Hamburger, French fries, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, and cheddar swiss cheese blend. I huge sorry goes out to my arteries! Please don't ask me if it's good, just re-read the above. Honorable pasty mention goes to the Bangers and Mash pasty stuffed with housemade pork, sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and a side of gravy.   Dudes, wear sweat pants to hide that food boner and ladies, nipple covers are recommended. Looking for a reason to a explore the Arts District via your tummy, well pop a squat my friend, you're here."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place that is also open late (thank heavens, because my girlfriend and I often don't eat dinner until past 9 PM). They also have the best shepherd's pie pasty that we've eaten too. If you need a drink, look no further than their hard cider. The cream of leek, potato and Stilton soup is also a must-try. We ate here two nights in a row when we were down here in the Phoenix area a couple years ago and would almost eat here every day if we could.  If you're traveling through town and want to take some pasties for yourself and friends back home, give them about 20 minutes notice for a mass order and they'll get them nice and hot for you.   Back home in SoCal, we have the Olde Ship. We tried the mushy peas here as well as the sticky toffee pudding. Our consensus was that the Cornish Pasty Co. has better mushy peas (the Olde Ship puts mint in theirs, which we found to be kind of weird), but the Olde Ship does sticky toffee pudding better. But we'll definitely come here again if we're in the Phoenix area.  The staff is also very nice and are a fun bunch to talk to (they seem like a bunch of laid-back, easy-going college students)."}
{"text":"O-M-G so so so delicious and so so so full!!! I have been wanting to come here for a couple months. Absolutely amazing! I tried the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup. So yummy with the homemade bread. Bangers and Mash pastie was amazing! Piping hot right out of the oven. I didn't care if I burned my mouth. Topped it all off with the Shirley Temple Pudding (aka Sticky Toffee Pudding) Delicious beginning to end."}
{"text":"This place is great! Unassuming on the outside, but inside they have a great warm atmosphere and the best pasty this side of the pond. I wish we'd found this place early in our trip, not as we are heading out. We'll be back here for sure! Great vegan options!"}
{"text":"Wow...we loved this place!  I had bookmarked this as a place I wanted to try a while back and I wasn't disappointed.  Never before had I had a pasty.  Clearly, I've been missing out!    This place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.  My wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!  We had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!"}
{"text":"my friend recommended this place to me because I mentioned I was going to AZ for a work trip.  I was with my big bosses and some other coworkers and we all went to eat here for a quick bite and drink before catching our flights.. My friend made a great rec because all of my coworkers had a good time and I got the credit for picking the location :P  We tried three different pasties and all three were delicious. Can't recall the actual names of them.. .one was the curry based one, the other was the thanksgiving one.. and the final one was one with the gravy sauce.. everyone loved each one and we just shared a whole bunch family style  Another plus about this place is their collection of beers .. mm... i'm not the biggest fan of beers but the beer that the bartender recommended to me was really good..  .. if i'm in AZ again I'll probably wanna stop here again for sure"}
{"text":"Got into Phoenix for business very late and my nearby hotel had a bar/restaurant, but the kitchen had already closed so the bar staff told me that I should go to Cornish. I walked over and loved the idea of the walk up bar/patio set up, but ended up going downstairs which had a bit of an underground club feel (all the way down to the eclectic choices in music). I ordered a roast beef sarnie with a horseradish sour cream and a drink. The drink came out right away and the food too a bit of time, but it was well worth it. It was VERY fresh out of the oven and I burned my fingers several times but I kept eating because it was so good. Two days later (today), I brought my coworker back here for lunch and had soup and an appetizer. They were also good. I may go back tomorrow before I leave!"}
{"text":"Again I am glad I checked out this restaurant after getting such high praise from YELP viewers.  This place is really hard to find,  I drove around for at least 15 minutes in the strip mall.  I almost gave up when I saw it.  For this reason I cannot give the restaurant a five.  If you are not really determined you will not find it.  Also it was really dark inside the restaurant.  Now to the food,  I had the meat and cheese pastor with red sauce and it was delicious.  The sauce was really tasty and compliments the pastie.  It was worth spending the time to find the place.  I saw other pasties on the menu that I want to try so I will go back soon."}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty Company for the charming atmosphere, great beer selection, and last but not least the food. If you come here sit at the bar and order a cajun chicken. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Banoffee pie is outstanding! Best desert ever, big enough for 2 or 3 people. The staff is pretty chill, sometimes the service is a little slow, but it's still good food."}
{"text":"If you have never had a pasty before in your life, you need to ask yourself what your problem is, and get down the the Cornish Pasty Company, ASAP!!!!!  I'm not going to go further, just go, find the one that looks best to you, and get it, you will NOT be disappointed!  Not to mention they have Hoegaarden on draft!!!"}
{"text":"When we decided to go to Cornish Pasty, I wasn't sure it would be a good choice.  My friends made the selection. When we walked in, the place was packed and, with open seating, we had a difficult time finding a table.  However, once I began eating I totally changed my mind. The roast pasty was delicious. Full of roast beef, vegetables, and gravy in a great tasting pastry. And quite a sizable portion that my wife and I split.  I also had a cup of potato leek soup. It too was very flavorful. The soup was only lukewarm but it tasted so good I ate it anyway. I should have mentioned it to our server but it was St. Patrick's Day and they were so busy. Considering the day and how busy they were the service was excellent. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Friday after the Diamonbacks game with a friend who knew where the place was, I would have never found it on my own.  You go down the stairs to a long narrow room, very dark with booths on one side and tall tables in the middle. There was only one girl handling service so she was swamped. We ordered two of the pastries from themenu, and a beer. The beer arrived. It took 30 minutes for the pastries and one of them was not what was ordered. The waitress apologized and took it back. We waited another 35 minutes for the correct one to arrive. By then the place was packed and so noisy that it was hard to hear. The manager came over an apologized, saying the waitress was doing her best but she was all alone on the floor. He said, and did, take one of the pastries off the bill. I told him it was not necessary but it was removed. Nice guy, with a goal to have a successful downtown restaurant, cannot fault him for that. The acoustics are bad as all the surfaces are hard and the sound just bounces off and around. Everyone there was having a great time, that is for sure. It is a popular place and seemed to have a loyal following. I am happy to see downtown businesses doing well. The food was OK, not much more. Seems this is a place to meet friends, have drinks, a bit of fool and a lot of loud, noisy conversation. I liked the place, but it is not for me, but for young folks, go and have fun."}
{"text":"The pastys (pasties) are decent, at least the ones I have tried.  The Walnut Mushroom Soup is about as tasty a veggie-based soup that you will find in this town.  Heavenly.  It's so rich that I get it in the \"cup\" size, since I think the bowl size would be sensory overload.  Go there just to try the soup - seriously - it's that good."}
{"text":"cozy, loud and wonderful place.  delicious food and beer."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite spots in Tempe. The food is terrific and the beer selection is solid. Where else can you get a 32 oz. mug of Founder's Porter?  The great thing about Cornish Pasty is the food selection. They have something for everyone! Not a fan of lamb? No problem! Try out the Carne Adovada - it's a delicious Southwestern concoction featuring red chili pork, Mexican rice and hatch chilies. Plus it's served with sour cream and salsa!  Seriously, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I know someone that used to work here and was told a lot of cool things I don't think most people know about such as the lighting is very dim inside to replicate the setting of a mine. Anyway, great selection of good quality beers, the large long tables to sit at unless you're at the bar stool like me, great tunes all the time, and a mellow crowd. Last but not least, The Pasty! I have a different one every time I go and I haven't been disappointed yet. The system they have in place in to bake them and give you the proper order is insane but works. Some other time for that. Overall, great place, cool area, and somewhere you should for sure check out."}
{"text":"While visiting the Tempe area for a conference as ASU, a member of our group of four was adamant that Cornish Pasty was \"the\" place to eat in Tempe. The rest of us had never even heard of the place, so we were excited to give it a try.   I would give our waitress 5 stars.   But I must take a few stars away for other issues. To begin, the place itself is really dark (kind of divey) which I'm not a huge fan of. Others would probably like it, but at 1pm, I want there to be a little bit of light in a building so I can see what I'm eating, others at the table, etc.   The pasty was \"ok\" in my opinion. The pastry itself is flaky and was pretty good. It seemed though that the filling varied at the table --depending on what you order, you may get something dry. I ended up getting a pasty that was supposed to be filled with spicy chicken and green chile but the chicken wasn't that spicy. The chile was just \"ok\" considering that we're in the southwest.   Drinks seemed expensive (and I'm talking about sodas here) and they charge for refills? I ended up getting a water.   Overall, I wasn't as impressed as others clearly are. Maybe we came at a bad day/time for the pasty. But I don't see myself stopping by the next time I'm in the area to find out."}
{"text":"The food is insane here! Although I must admit, it is hard for me to order anything other than the 'lovely bit'o salmon.' My bf gets the rosemary chicken (delicious!) and he is stuck on his fav as well. We did try a couple of appetizers and food off of our friends' plates and we are always pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything is :). The beer selection is always great! The service... hit or miss but this is one of the few places where I wouldn't let that steer me away. We come here to get our fix at least once every couple of weeks. YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited for a late dinner and drink. My cocktail was made to perfection and the Reuben pasty was delicious! They have Great selection of craft draft beer."}
{"text":"Incredible food!!  I'm salivating just with the thought of this place...even 1000 miles away!  The ambience is dark with lots of commotion, people talking, laughing and loving their food...some look like they are in a date with their pasty.  I had the \"Lovely bit of salmon\" pasty, and wish I had room for more! Quite filling and promising as explained by the server.  I hardly ever drink, but couldn't resist with their interesting selection of beer, I indulged a wild blueberry beer(can't remember name).  Would have given a 5 star rating....BUT my pet peeve-\"Restroom Condition\" prevented that and lost a star.  When you open the restroom door a heavy stench of piss hits you right in the nose! Don't go to the restroom prior eating-you might lose a \"Lovely Bit of Appetite\"!!! No cleaning log sheet either. Suggestion: remodel Bathroom and keep cleaner."}
{"text":"Peculiar to find an establishment like this in Phoenix, but welcomed never the less. The layout of this place can be confusing. There's either a long, dark strip of bar seats or a regular table area, cut off by the bar. They had quite a selection of pasties, but I went with the English Breakfast. It was quite the sweet and savory combo. The dough itself held everything well and it had a nice, flaky texture. The ingredients were OK, but it lacked any robust flavor. I dont know if this is staying true to the British cuisine or what, but everything was a bit mild in flavor. I was also taken back by how big these things were. They truly are the size of a calzone rather than an empanada. Service sucks here, but at the same time, it kinda fits the vibe. Lots of college kids, overworked and understaffed. I think what this place offers is worth trying, but unless they have something special that  Im unaware about, dont expect these pasties to rock your world."}
{"text":"This is the real deal and being British I would know.  They have recently moved, great new restaurant, obviously The Cornish  Pasties are spot on especially The Oggie but their mushy peas and oven backed chips are great. Lovely lunch and cool venue in the evening with a bar, pools tables, darts and a shuffle board."}
{"text":"This visit marks my foray into the wonderful world of pasties. A friend of mine lived in England and continues to rave about these savory treats.  After visiting Cornish Pasty Co. I am sold. I had the Cottage Pie pasty, an exceptional blend of beef, carrots, peas, mashed potatoes and cheddar in the most beautifully golden crust I may have ever enjoyed. (My primary take away is that Cottage Pie is Shepherd's Pie with beef standing in for lamb.) I took my more than generous sized pasty to go. While I waited, I sat at the bar and enjoyed a cider which was on tap. The two bartenders who took care of me were very friendly and quite forthcoming with information about the menu.  I can't wait to go back and have a proper sit-down meal. The long tables and bench seating would be great for a large gathering of friends in a quaint, intimate setting.  One pasty is plenty for a meal. There will probably be leftovers. I loved the red wine gravy!"}
{"text":"The food, the experience, the service...this place is tops in my book!  Some of my friends and I had driven by this place a few times and finally made the decision to stop in for dinner.  Unfortunately, we made that decision without realizing that the day we'd chosen was also First Friday.  This restaurant is located in the heart of the First Friday festivities, so I would strongly recommend going on a day where it won't be so busy and parking won't be a huge problem.  Seriously, though, if my biggest complaints were parking problems and a huge dinner crowd, then clearly this place knows what they're doing.  The food was amazing.  They tailor make each main dish with specific sauces to pair well with it and the appetizers are also delicious.  Our amazing server was so slammed and battling a broken soda machine, but still managed to make our first (definitely, not last) experience fantastic!  What really got me was that this restaurant offers a \"half-baked\" option on their pasties where you can place an order for pickup and finish baking them at home.  Still tastes just as amazing when half of it is baked from the regular oven in my home while I'm wearing my pajamas.  Highly recommend...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best deal in Vegas!  Bomb ass food,cute servers and affordable prices!  It is located in a odd strip mall. Both of my uber drivers couldn't find easily but I assume it's cheap rent. I ordered the Ruben Pastie and it was so perfectly tasty. I wish we had something like this in Cali. The portions are really nice which is a pro and con. Pro since it's very filling but Con since I want to try more variety. Even though I was full from the Ruben I ordered Dessert. It was a cold graham cracker bottom with thick Carmel,bananas and whipped cream! It is big enough for four people. I am stuffed but happy. The vibe is chill with rock/punk music playing. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! The shell to the pasty's is so flaky and yummy, reminiscent of quiche, and the plethora of choices is to die for!"}
{"text":"Who: Cornish Pasty Co.   What: Chicken Alfredo Pasty (Me) - Quite yummy, just a tad salty; Greek Chicken Pasty (Friend) - Pleasant, needed a bit more chicken; 2 Newcastle pints (tap) and 1 iced tea.   When: Friday night - early enough to grab the last table in the joint. Come 8:30, it was getting crowded. Good vibe.  Where: In a yucky strip mall. Like nearly everything else in this state.  Why: Because we're tired of the same old crappy take-out options. Because we wanted something fresh. Because it got good reviews on this site. Because it's an independent food joint with a bit of authentic culture to boot. (They've got Pavlova and Banoffee Pie! Holy effin-A!)  How: awesome was it? Quite. Nice atmosphere, see all positives noted in other reviews. Little things detracted from a five-star giving. However, I will be back. And not for a meaty pasty next time. For one of their delish-sounding desserts. Check out the menu at their website. Yuh-hum!"}
{"text":"I think that this place is so cool for some reason. It's definitely unique and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I came to order food to go with a co-worker yesterday (3/3/2017). We sat at bar to wait and they offered us waters right away while we waited. I ordered the shepherd pie pasty and is was delicious!! It went great with the red wine sauce that comes with it! I also ordered the Carmel apple pie pasty which was very good as well, my only complaint is the whipped cream was bland. Like no vanilla flavor, no sugar. It was like eating whipped half and half or fluff with no purpose since so tasteless. My other co workers complained about it too. Portions are big, even with one pasty, you'll have leftovers.   The place just opened across the street from my job. You enter from the street into a bar area to the left and a few tables to right (plus the tables on patio out front). In the middle is stairs going down to a basement level. I didn't go down there, so not sure if it's for workers or open to public. Then there are stairs on both sides of the restaurant going up to another floor with more tables to sit and eat. I really liked the feel and look of the place. It was packed with lots of people. Staff was very nice and helpful. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great beer, best food around. You will not be disappointed, don't let the atmosphere fool you."}
{"text":"Food is unique + tasty and they've got a great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ambiance... The service... The music... The accommodation... The food... It's all just awesome. It's located in commercial center next to our favorite Thai place, komol.     The lighting is perfect for the environment. The bar is old antique looking wood and the booths are all old church pews. The music is eclectic mixes of sounds like old modest mouse, iron and wine, interpool, joy division... Etc... The menus are awesome and their wine and beer selection is great. The Pinot noir is awesome here, get a bottle.     They offer a great selection of appetizers... The mushy peas are vegan and delicious... My boyfriend enjoyed the jalapeño curry as well (it wasn't vegan) :(. Our friends got the chips and said the hp? Sauce is out of this world. They offer homemade soups and salads as well.      The pasty selection is double sided! They offer a full section of vegetarian options and even offer veggie chicken and daiya cheese... I ordered the vegan pasty minus the pasty. Basically... I had them prepare the insides of the portobello balsamic pasty with curried potatoes and extra veggies.., and they baked it to perfection. We will probably have to come back and splurge our carbs on a vegan patsy one day for sure. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food as well.     Our server was really great. His name began with an H and he had a beard. Seriously so so patient and knowledgable about the food. He was also the bartender and held down the restaurant like a total pro. Oh i forgot to mention the decadent dessert... Looked amazing! Couldn't eat it but everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"You'd never guess from the outside what deliciousness awaits you behind those doors. Perfectly reminiscent of a  dark, back alley English pub in the best way. Cool, laid back atmosphere.  We were here at lunchtime and there was a pretty good crowd in there but we were seated with no wait. My husband, father and I each had a beer and then checked out the large menu. Excellent selections and even had a vegan/vegetarian menu for those that get into that sort of thing.  I had the Guinness stew pasty, which was perfectly cooked and reminded me of amazing winter comfort food. It came with a side of sour cream and chives sauce which was good, but I highly recommend asking for a side of the red wine gravy. It's awesome! My husband had the Cajun chicken pasty which was just a bit spicy and delicious. My dad ordered the porky pasty and he was impressed as well. Also had a side of the fries which were hand cut and just a bit over cooked on the sides and perfectly done in the middle. Just the way fries should be.  It's a bit of a drive for us since we are in North Peoria and we ventured to the Tempe location off of University, but worth the drive. We will definitely be back and also hit up their other locations when in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying this review is probably pointless, since I doubt any of you will read 780 reviews to make a decision. But this is my favorite meal in Tempe. The wait staff is great, and not the fake \"hi welcome to blah blah blah I'm so happy you're dining with us can I take your order\". This is truly a great part of Tempe culture. If you feel uncomfortable here because it's hipstery or whatever else, may I suggest any of the corporate food chains in Gilbert?  I have never had a bad meal here...EVER. With all that being said there is really only one Pasty worth ordering that is the Shepard's Pie. Look I get it there are like 50 other ones here to choose from but save your time and just order the Sheppard's pie."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday after finding it on Yelp.  It was just great.  In addition to a wonderful pasty, the atmosphere was very cool.  The staff was very friendly and service was great too.  I wish we had one in San Antonio!"}
{"text":"I hoped for more from Cornish Pasty Co.  I ordered the Rosemary Chicken (pictured) and while the chicken was pleasantly moist, there was absolutely NO hint of rosemary.  The peppers were fine, but the entire pasty was overpowered by the taste of vinegar the peppers were soaked in.  :(  I also ordered a half-baked Oggie (pictured) to go for a friend and am told it largely tasted like a pot pie.  I guess that's fine if that's what you're looking for, but the only flavor stand out seemed to be the wine-flavored gravy.  The dining room near the entrance was rather small, but it seems they're expanding into the space next door to create a second, larger dining room and second bar (pictured.)  It's unclear if they intend to continue remodeling or if it's complete, but it currently has a combination of very dated details as well as newer, more modern ones.  The second dining room is filled with old church pews for seating which I have mixed feelings about.  I'm happy to see they've been re-purposed, but can't help but wonder how many funerals they've \"seen.\"  It's slightly creepy while trying to eat.  The server was nice enough, but I have a pet peeve about restaurant cleanliness.  It was rather slow and the server amused himself between visits to the table by playing darts with another patron.  I could care less how he spends his down time, but would have appreciated seeing him wash his hands after touching the same darts other people have used.  Who knows where THEIR hands have been???  If I ever pay CPC another visit, I think I'll skip the entree and try dessert, instead.  Or better yet, skip the dessert and plunk down $3 for a Happy Hour Car Bomb and hope they offer free WiFi by then.  Hopefully, the bartender's hands will be clean."}
{"text":"Been coming here since day one, which was about 10 years ago. Wow has it grown! Always come hungry and leave satisfied. It's a great experience during the day, but way better at night. Place looks like the bat cave. Rosemary chicken ftw!"}
{"text":"Starters: Very cool wait staff.  Good vibe in this place...seriously.  They had old Talking Heads buzzing in the. background.  Leek, potato, stilton soup...Yowza!  Pomegranate tea was a nice alternative to a pint.  Salmon pasty suggested by my vegetarian waiter came out hot and unexpectedly firm...which was awesome.  Dillsauce rocked.  Thin cut potatos and asparagus...Double Yowza!  I am totally in for more of this."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, very tasty. I will come back for sure!  I had the chicken pot pie my wife had the Oggie. The garlic chips are off the hook. If you like pasties this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Oh fuck yea!!! Best customer service of my life!!! Coming back here everyday and receiving the ultimate service!!! Best is the biz if you ask me. Wow amazing every time!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin with this place, but I'm soon moving from Tempe and I'll be missing this place as much as anywhere else. Every Pasty I've had is delicious, and I am particular to the Cajun Chicken. My wife always gets the Veggie Cottage Pie, and swears by it.  The atmosphere is fantastic for a casual dinner and drinks with wife, sig other, or friends. Has a decent import selection for drinks (not large, but well ranged). The wait staff is always friendly. My first return trip to Tempe will lend itself to a trip or two here. One of the few unique and home grown places in Tempe that are worth a visit."}
{"text":"We recently hosted our company holiday party at the downtown location and had a truly AWESOME experience! The event coordinator Aaron was so great, he went above and beyond to ensure the food was perfect, the bartenders were prepped and we had everything we needed the entire evening. The staff was wonderful, very accommodating and quick to get drinks made for 50+ people! I would highly recommend this venue for any event you may be hosting! Our holiday party was a smash and it was largely due to an awesome host, amazing staff, and of course, delicious food."}
{"text":"You can drive by this place 100 times and never even notice. However, once you do notice and let your curiosity draw you inside, you will never forget. Amazing food, ambiance and staff. Certainly a favorite."}
{"text":"Had the carne adavada pasty there. It was quite good. Interesting they could combine two distinctly different types of cuisines and have it work so well. Whomever came up with recipe for the meat knows what they are doing!"}
{"text":"YUMMY PASTIES, and no i'm not referring to the ones you're used to. Pasties here are thin flaky pastries filled with many savory options from american to indian influenced   one pasty is perfect as a meal & the crust is what makes them so good ---oggie: the beef wasn't the best but the potatoes were flavorful! i liked the red wine gravy that comes as a dipping sauce!  i can't wait to come back & try other options  NOTE: in terms of atmosphere don't expect to walk into grandmas house because they serve up pasties, think dark dive bar (which was perfect as a low key lunch after our crazy night)"}
{"text":"Very hipster, but the pasties make it worth coming back. It's tough to stray from my go to: The Pilgrim (it's like thanksgiving in your mouth everyday of the year). They have over 20 different varieties to choose from though, so it's sure to please the entire group.  TIP: Wash it down with one (or two or more) 3 dollar Irish Car Bombs all day everyday"}
{"text":"Vegan pasties are bomb ! Large quantity for a good price. Servers are always super chill and friendly. You can see them making the food there in front of you which is nice. Atmosphere is nice as well/rustic vibes."}
{"text":"Awesome... You can't go wrong with any pasty... Also, I'm extremely partial to the Irish car bombs.  Not a bad place to pregame before mill :)"}
{"text":"My sister brought me here. I usually doubt her preferences but had an amazing experience. The food was incredibly tasty! I had the chicken alfredo pasty and an Iron Maiden beer (so hard to find in Vegas!) and I left this place in a food coma. It has a dive bar vibe, similar to those in Hollywood and it does get quite warm in there but what do you expect, they actually use real ovens! The servers were great and got to you as quickly as possible. Even the cook gave us some recommendations. I'll be back for more! This will be my go to winter eatery."}
{"text":"Pro: Cool beers (as in lots of cool brands), cool place, you get to watch the food being made. Lots of meat options and lots of veg/vegan options. Has a Happy hour!  Con: bit hot inside even at night."}
{"text":"Whenever my family and I road trip through Phoenix, we make sure to stop in and have a pasty. We originally came in because my British husband wanted to come and have a pasty. He was pleasantly surprised to find they were comparable to the pasties back home. My daughter and I also enjoyed our meal. We ordered the shepherds pie pasty, Oggie pasty, sausage, scotch eggs, and sticky toffee pudding. Everything was tasty .    We recently tried their new location in Flagstaff and it was exceptional!  Give this establishment a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This narrow restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall in Tempe near ASU. Popular among the hippy type, it reminds me of my time in Portland, OR. There are only a handful of two seater tables and one long bar for seating. The restaurant fills up fast at dinner time and is a very tight fit to try to find an open seat among patrons and servers.   I ordered the Royale with Cheese. I would have liked to have it without mushrooms but the pasties are pre-made so no changes or substitutions can be made. Luckily the mushrooms were pretty big and easy to pick out. The pasty was delicious overall but the meat was a bit salty. The menu says it has french fries but they are really just potatoes cut like fries and not actually deep fried. I liked that. I was afraid the french fries would make it too greasy but they were a great addition.   My friend had a Cottage Pie Pasty. He said it was delicious and had no complaints. The red wine sauce complimented it well.  As I noted above, this place can get pretty busy and the servers run around like crazy serving and bussing tables. Service isn't superb but the food really makes up for it. Go here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So my friend (Jason B.) suggested this place...and I was not convinced by the name...weird images of pot pies out of the movie Sweeney Todd, floated through my mind...I know that is so horrible! Sorry if I grossed anyone out with that! Then to top it off, it was almost impossible to find, because it was so dark!   The place is long and skinny, and when you sit at the bar you get to watch people make the calzones (for lack of a better word) which is fun! It was kind of weird at first to have a conversation, but you get comfortable!  We decided to order 2 and share, so we could try more variety. We got a meat and cheese, which was served with a red wine sauce. Maybe because I am not a fan of red wine I didn't like the sauce!?!? But the pastry was so tasty! The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy!   We also ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, wow was this spicy! Don't get me wrong I can handle spice! And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing!   I am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.  But please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry. Fresh hot out of the oven with jelly sauce....oh my! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! When you go, and you should, don't forget dessert!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Cornish Pasty has opened up downtown. I loved going to the original location in Tempe while I was at ASU and the new downtown location does not disappoint!  This new location is massive. They have an upstairs dining area, a ground floor section with church pew tables like the original Cornish Pasty, outdoor area, and a downstairs area with a lounge bar vibe.  I typically got the delicious vegetarian eggplant parmesan pasty, but I decided to try the Lovely Bit of Salmon and it was indeed lovely. The salmon was delicious and tasted amazing in a pasty filled with asparagus, tomatoes, spinach and potatoes. I also tried out the Apple Caramel Pasty with ice cream for dessert which was delicious.   I've read some other reviews about slow service and have to say that I experienced the opposite. While there, our waitress came up to apologize about the wait for our food (which really didn't seem abnormally long) and us offered the free dessert. How amazing is that?!?! Talk about amazing customer service."}
{"text":"I think my issue was I'm not a fan of a Pasty. The waitstaff is really nice and knowledgeable. Seating is kind of uncomfortable( seats and tables). Place has a pool table and other cool things to do. Okay fri night bar hangout spot."}
{"text":"Curl up in this cozy, (and by cozy I mean totally and utterly tiny) dark pub with friends, a boddington and a Cornish pasty, preferably of the \"thanksgiving dinner\" variety. There are of course other amazing Cornish pasty flavors which my Phoenix mates have raved about, which I've yet to try, mainly due to the fact that I live in Los Angeles. I trust their tastes though, so you can believe that everything on the menu is definitely worth a go. The atmosphere takes you right out of the States and puts you smack dab in the middle of London on a misty summer night. A tasty way to stay-cation. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Still love this place! Came here on a 1st Friday and it was slammed. We waited 20 minutes for a table, the hosts were basically just the servers. There was a love show going on in the back and the music was loud! I loved everything about it this night and gladly waited because I knew it was going to be great! Our food order was taken and we waited another 20. My boyfriend destroyed the Cuban and I got the Italian and mashed potato. Everything about this place is divine! So glad they came to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and had the lamb and mint pasty which was cooked perfectly .... we also ordered the scotch egg which is one of the best I've tasted in Vegas .... the salmon cesar salad was also a great compliment to the our main .... will be back again."}
{"text":"New type of place for me with giant, not frozen, hotpockets? I'm down. Was excellent and the service great also. Been back twice since going here a couple months ago.   Is really small so plan on a wait. Or go to the Mesa one which is huge compared to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"I like this place so much. Here was so good and portions were huge. They've got free pool, but the balls and tables are really old and janky. But i love the atmosphere here. Would be back!"}
{"text":"Have visited Cornish pasty 4 times so far. It's one of the unique  places to eat in town. Dimlit even in Daylight and always busy during the lunch hour. But the staff are fast and efficient and they take care of you. They explain pasties for the ones who are new to the place. I tried both mock chicken pasties(Asiago mock chicken) and the real chicken (chicken Tikka masala) pasties. Both were good with the real  chicken being much better with the side of yogurt. Pasties as such are like a bigger versions of samosa for Indians. But they are different. And this is a must try place atleast one time just for the uniqueness of the dish. Have not tried the desert pasties yet...!!!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely different from the one on Guadalupe. It's not in the best area of town and when you go inside, it's kind of like a dungeon. All the windows are covered, it's super dark and almost creepy like. However, don't let that scare you away! Their food is still the best ever! You must try their cajun chicken pasty. Yumyumyum!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing Cornish Pasty for awhile, but couldn't figure out a good occasion to visit. Then, one night I decided I wasn't starving but wanted something new to eat, and ended up there (and ended up eating a ton anyways!). The space is surprisingly large, I expected something like a deli and I don't know why. We were seated at a window table but the entire back area is a bar with billiards and shuffleboard. There were just as many people hanging out at the bar as there were dining in the restaurant section. It's obviously a cool place to be even if you aren't planning to eat.   We started out with a couple Boddington's on draft and tandoori wings. I love Indian, but Tandoori chicken isn't a dish I usually order. These wings though were really great. They're incredibly flavorful but give you a sense of eating healthy, especially with the yogurt dip. I loved the cucumbers but wasn't a fan of the tomatoes that come with. As always I could use a little more heat but these wings are a solid appetizer.   For pasties, I ordered the Guiness Stew and my boyfriend had the Royale with Cheese. The Guiness Stew was stuffed with tender meat and vegetables and had a comforting, home made feel to it. The cheddar was a bit excessive at times, and could overpower the flavor of the gravy. The Royale with Cheese by comparison was like a flavor explosion. Immediately I tasted the salty, thick bacon and it reminded me a bit of corned beef? The hamburger was actually a solid hamburger, not loose bits of ground beef as I had expected but this was much better as it gives you something to bite into. Obviously the french fries get soggy in the pasty and I didn't feel like it added much to the experience. However the Royale with Cheese was the favorite for both of us and it's going to be hard to not continue ordering this in the future. For dessert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. The cake was moist and came sizzling in toffee with a side of vanilla ice cream. Perfect portion to share.   All in all I'm excited to make my way through this menu but also just hang out here. It's close to the Artifice so it's perfect for bar hopping away from Fremont East. I'm always glad when a long-bookmarked eatery fulfills all my expectations. Cheers to Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"My first trip here but it was worth the wait. My colleague and I enjoyed the Chicken Greek and Peppered Steak. Service was quick even on a busy Friday!"}
{"text":"Vegan Southwest Pasty was incredible!! Very spicy but worth it haha! My server was great, I'll definitely be back for another."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The meatball appetizer wrapped in bacon in red wine gravy was to die for. After recently relocating to the downtown area I finally got around to trying this place and I can say for sure I'll be here all the time. I was even told I could pick up to go and bake at home on the way home from work! They have free pool and a good selection of beers. Also on Sunday they have a blue grass band in the afternoon! And have I mentioned how incredible the food is. Weather you a local or just visiting if you try Cornish pastys you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Best Cornish pasties I've ever had outside of Cornwall!!! The real deal. Nom, nom. Great beer and atmosphere too."}
{"text":"What can I say this place rocks! Great food and $3 car bombs all day every day!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably Tasty  My friends and I went to the Cornish Pasty Company for a bite to eat, and  all I can say is; the food was unbelievably tasty. Everyone cleaned their plates and wished there was  more.  Each person in our party ordered a different flavor, and each bite  was better than the next.  Lets face it, what's not to like?  Take flavorful meat, cheese, unique vegetable combinations, wrap it up in a flakey pastry, then bake it until hot inside and crispy outside.  Serve it up with a side dipping sauce, it doesn't get much better. While your waiting  for your delicious entrée, take advantage of the great beer selection the Cornish Pasty Company has to offer.  Sip on a ice cold draft from a great selection while your delicious entrée is baking.    The Cornish Pasty Company has a great atmosphere, very casual and comfortable.  Wish my phone wqs working because I would have taken pictures. I would  definitely go back to the Cornish Pasty Company again and again."}
{"text":"Great good but it never fails, everytime I come here and order a non-pastry item, they are out of it. Not sure why. But when available, the food is delicious and the service id Great 90% of the time. I noticed when the bartender is in their 30 's and above, they are attentive. But when they appear younger, the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Well done Cornish pastries of many flavors.  Filling, savory, well-priced, and with a good atmosphere.  We sat outside on a perfect spring evening in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I didn't know what a Pasty was until I came here. I had just flown in from California and I was hungry. I did a quick search and found the Cornish Pasty. The food was absolutely amazing and so full of flavor. The staff was friendly and the place had a true pub feel to it. I ordered the cheesesteak pasty and the roast dinner pasty. My favorite was the cheesesteak. I ordered the apple pie pasty and pb & j pasty for dessert and they were equally delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, I thought this place was shut down. Windows were black, no eye-catching sign, etc. Come to find out, it's open, and all that adds to the ambiance of the place. I didn't care too much for the dark pub eating experience, though.   As for the food, I ordered two  pasties and a desert. I liked the the pasty crust, but the fillings lacked flavor to me. The dessert was the best part! Good ole' Apple caramel pasty with ice cream!   At least I can say I've tried a Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this spot and I have got to say its probably my favorite place to eat in AZ. My fiance and I eat there at least once a week. I have eaten every Pasty on the menu, and I honestly don't think i have been disappointed once (maybe a thing or two forgotten when we do take out but they always make up for it)   It is a super original spot to take your family if you are in town. There is a nice dining room with a bar and an outdoor patio on the north side, and then on the south end there is a whole other local bar spot called \"The Beast\". A lot of people don't even know it's there. Its a super hip dark lit bar with comfy couches and a stage area that has some old church pews as tables setup. There is a couple pool tables and dart boards. They have live music sometimes and serve the whole Cornish menu. Its pretty much just another part of the same restaurant, but for us locals. A part of the kitchen is behind the bar and you can see how much preparation and fresh ingredients go into these pasties.   Check out their spot on Mill Ave. also for a shot and a late night snack. They usually have the whole menu available as well. Love this restaurant like I love New York pizza. And thats a lot!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm one of those people who would usually find what I like on the menu and stick to it, but here, I mix it up, have eaten almost everything and I've never found anything I don't like. It's also not a bad place to grab beer or glass of wine if you're into that. Anytime I have friends or family in town this is one of the first places I want to bring them."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!! I can't imagine it's the pastry cuisine!!! The restaurant outside is dark like closed, don't be afraid ,just come in and have a sit. Your  stomach would be full of satisfaction and fun."}
{"text":"The food is good, the beer is good, John is an asshole though ; )"}
{"text":"I had never heard of the Cornish Pasty Co until I came across the hundreds of awesome reviews on yelp..... thank you yelp!!! This has become one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Since discovering the Pasty Co, I have been twice in less than a week with no notion of slowing down!   This spot is tucked away in the back of a shopping center with a small sign letting you know it actually exists.  Although it can be hard to find, this is one of the things I feel leads to the overall experience of the restaurant.  Inside the restaurant its dark and cozy - total pub feel!! Also, the staff is extremely friendly.    Pasties I've tried: ALL AMAZING chicken pot pie bangers and mash reuben  chips (french fries) with garlic apple caramel dessert pasty"}
{"text":"If you want some hearty meat and carbs, come and get some delicious pasties, which are what they're famous for! I kid you not their tandoori wings and cheese broccoli were also surprisingly delicious!  Food-wise, great. I tried their shepherd's pie pasty and it was just so savory and flavorful. We completely devoured the perfectly seasoned and grilled tandoori chicken wings. The cheese broccoli was just another way to ramp up our fat and calorie intake without any regrets.  Love the vibe there. People were all chilling and staff were friendly. It was kind of confusing at first. It was not easy to find, being tucked in the corner at the back with no bright signs or large entrance. We managed to locate this restaurant. When we walked in, we didn't know who the host/ess was, so we had to wait at the entrance to see if anyone would come and greet us. Finally a waitress walked to us and seat us at a picnic table outside. There were at least two large community tables out there, and people, probably mostly students, were just hanging out, drinking, eating and having fun. It's just a very relaxing way to spend the night.  Great place to eat and hang out! Prices were pretty reasonable too."}
{"text":"Went late night yesterday. Place was crowded but the service was top notch. Banger and mash, chicken tikka masala pasties were amazing. Drinks came out fast and were good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"If you ever had 3 days of meetings in different cities each day, spending more time at the airports than the hotels, you will discover that you can end up eating non stop because food is available everywhere...at the meetings, at the hotel, in your luggage.... and you  eat sometimes just to pass the time.   At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows  Dinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:  \"How about pastys for dinner?\"  He went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....  \"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"  \"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"  Still thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.  \"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.  We arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.     It is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.    Sitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.  I wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is Atlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes.   WHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.  My buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.  If ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.  After dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel..."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and has amazing food. It is like nothing I've experience in Vegas before.  It has a dimly-lit Pub Style atmosphere.  The menu is filled with a good selection  of British comfort food and a great selection of beers. The prices are very reasonable and most options on the menu have a solid serving size. I would highly recommend this place for all adults  meetings  or dinners  and would be great for  a date   definiately bring your friends or co-workers it willbe a great time all around"}
{"text":"With Bobby Y. recommendations four of us decided to check the place out. It was somewhat a cozy place with neat seating (church pews and metal molded seats...interesting).      As soon as we sat down, waitress told us their tap beers were down (drop one star). She was very helpful and helped made some suggestions. Awesome suggestions by the way!      Banana beer is a must. I tried the ginger beer which was very refreshing. A bit on the sweet side. Beer selection is great, but if your looking for wine, you have one choice of wine in each kind.      If you have never had a pasty, you gotta come a try. They are yummy! The choices of filling is very flavorful and the pastry wrap was flaky.     The dessert was very sweet. I can only take a couple bites. Maybe too sweet for me. Overall experience, will go back again to try the other beers and pasties!"}
{"text":"The prices are pretty good compared to a lot of places, and the food is unique.  I wasn't much of a fan, I got the bangers and mash pastie and the Cajun chicken one, I liked the Cajun one better, but neither were great imo.  I'm also not a fan of the lack of service.  There are no waiters but no real line or counter to order at either.  Felt weird and disorganized, which was proven when a drink order and a good order was messed up.  Probably a cool place to hangout and drink beer, but not really set up for dinner."}
{"text":"So good! I had the chicken alfredo pasty and boyfriend had the bangers and mash. I'll never eat a Hot Pocket again! Happy hour is only 3-5, so get there early and enjoy a dollar off beers (not sure if this is drafts and/or bottles).  The place is small...and I'm all about cozy establishments, but when it smells nasty and the bathroom feels like an outhouse, I'm getting take out in the future."}
{"text":"Very cool little place with delicious food. A bit pricey and portions are small. But the taste and atmosphere puts it over the top for me."}
{"text":"The pasty looks small enough that you can conquer the whole thing, but don't be fooled! It will fill you up quick!!  My favorite is the Guiness stew!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great atmosphere and really good food. So many choices of English pasties- traditional, vegetarian, new versions. We went around 8:30 and got a table right away. It's our second time back and would come again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to update my review to reflect the fabulous customer service I received in response to my original 1-star post. Almost immediately, I was contacted by the owner, apologized to, and refunded for my entire meal. As if that wasn't enough, I was also invited back for a \"re-do\" of sorts, and I will definitely take advantage of the offer. The way this issue was handled is a sure sign of a 5-star business, and Cornish Pasty deserves to be recognized. Cheers, and thank you!  BTW - if you read my original post, you will see that the food and its quality was never the issue. These pasties are delicious and the beer selection is top-notch."}
{"text":"Great food, mediocre service.  Not someplace to go with a big group or kids, but if you have a little time to wait - it's worth it!  If you like mushrooms, you must try the Mushroom, Walnut, & Spinach Soup, it's amazing!  I come from a long line of miners from Cornwall, and pasties were a staple growing up.  These are the closest to homemade you will find.  Although, they could use more rutabagas, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The eagerly anticipated Cornish Pasty downtown did not disappoint!  All your pasty goodness in the heart of downtown.  They had a blood orange citrus cider on tap that was delicious and of course the pasties were all we expected them to be.  They were very busy but someone stepped in to serve us and apologized for the wait.  So happy to have our own Cornish Pasty closer to home!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Disappointed to discover we were unable to eat at our initial choice with our 14 yr old, we were wandering the very eclectic neighborhood and found this welcoming spot. We're very familiar with pasties (family made from scratch with home rendered lard) and thought we'd try. We got a window seat, a delightful frosty cocktail, a great brew and a time to make the perfect selection for our late lunch of pasties. We shared three & loved them all. The crust was beautiful, golden and flaky. I wish we could have taken some home with us!!! Go, go often, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. I mean hipster kinda cool. Great open kitchen, English draft and beers, and the menu is all pastries. They had great combinations and a long list of vegetarian and vegan options which is an extra thumbs up for me. Food I had the vegetarian tikki masala which had a marinated \"chicken\" with a cucumber yogurt sauce. It was good. Crunchy pastry, good amount of stuffing. The boyfriend had their hamburger pastry to which he didn't have a liking to so much. What I did love was their potato leek soup and the home made bread that came along with that. The soup was excellent, very flavorful and starchy, just the way I like a potato base soup.  We also had the broccoli and cauliflower bake and oven chips with jalapeños. The bake was just alright with a heavy bechamel cream sauce that was definitely under salted. The oven chips were just under cooked fries. Meh....  Staff The staff is was very casual, which is cool. Our waitress was cool. She git out food order and didn't bother us much which I appreciated.   I would definitely go again and just order a big bowl of soup and baskets of bread:)"}
{"text":"This whole restaurant is about 10ft wide and 20ft long, and it is always packed. Now that I know better, I try to grab a seat at the bar for a little more elbow room; there are a few larger booths in the back too.   My boyfriend took me here on our first \"real\" date, and I'll have to admit that I was pretty impressed in spite of myself. I ordered the Pesto Chicken (decent) and he got the Lovely Bit a Salmon (much better). In subsequent visits I would discover the Royale with Cheese which is my favorite pasty so far. Also, the Mexican and the Carne Adovada are fantastic menu options.   Outside of the pasty realm, almost everything else on the menu is worth trying. The Greek Salad has to be my favorite of the salad choices; the dressing really makes this dish. Comprised of homemade caramel sauce, bananas, thick graham cracker crust, and whipped cream--the Banoffee Pie is to die for.   And now for drinks...they offer a pretty good beer selection. And Car Bombs are always $3.00 (yes, please!). The happy hour is alright, but Wednesday Wino Day is the best drink special ($3).   We can't wait to try the PB&J pasty for dessert next time we go back!"}
{"text":"Scotch egg  was good a little on the dry side, must try the Tandoori wings! The atmosphere was very chill, we hung out upstairs doing some people watching, fun! My old fashioned drink was nice and strong, the way I like"}
{"text":"Awsome food.  Good cream-based mushroom-spinach-walnut soup, had great portobello-chicken-balsamic pasty with homemade marinara sauce, and mushy peas (made from fresh peas).  Great all around.  They also have a great assortment of beers and English-Irish hard ciders.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"WOW! As an appetizer we started with the Chips and added the garlic. They were perfect amount of crisp and seasoning. Next, we ordered The Oggie and Chicken Pot Pie. They both had the red gravy that was the perfect touch. Both pasties were great!   The service was okay considering they were pretty busy. However, food came out very quickly.   Everything on the menu looks so delicious. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I'm sure I agree with just about everyone else's raves about this place, so here's my own spin on the place:  I love love love that I never knew puff pastry could be so versatile and delicious.  Lovely bit o salmon is just that! The veggies inside are perfect! And the sauce mmmm!  The Royale is named so appropriately!! If you like burgers, you will Love it!!   Service is good, always someone spunky and friendly.  But my main reason it's awesome??? I reheated my Lovely Bit o Salmon in the microwave 2 days later, and it was still astoundingly fresh tasting but perhaps even more flavorful?!  That might just be a culinary miracle.   I recommend this place to anyone, visiting, living here, young, old, meat lovers and not."}
{"text":"My Grandma used to make Pasties for us when I was a kid, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant in Tempe. For those who don't know, a pasty is your choice of filling baked into a delicious flaky crust, wrapped all the way around. Then it is cut in half to eat. Kind of like a hot pocket, but way way better. :)   My favorite pasty is the Carne Adovada. Perfect amount of spicy and cooled off with the cheese and sour cream. The Italian is also very good. They offer a wide variety of choices, something for everyone, along with a vegetarian menu. I am also told the deserts are superb, but I am always too full when I get to that point. Usually there are a few people assembling the next batch of pasties behind the counter, so that is kind of neat to see. Pasties are premade, so there is no customizing the filling.   They have expanded so there is A LOT more seating room. In the past I would not have gone with a group, however now they could easily accommodate. Good beer list also. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Before I went to this lovely hole in the wall I had never even heard of a pasty -- I actually read about this place on yelp and wanted to give it a try!  They have a great British vibe with a very eclectic feel to it.   Great beer selection.  I knew I was going to love this place when I saw that they had Strongbow on draft :)  I usually get Cottage PIe or Bangers/Mash... you can't go wrong with either of those.  Their greek salad is amazing too... and definitely go for the garlic 'oven chips' if you go there... very tasty!    My mouth is watering just writing this review  :)"}
{"text":"I love to be impressed with a place I go to for the first time. My daughter has been to Cornwall and fell in love with \"pasty's\" and chips and all else that was Cornwall, so she was really excited to give this place a try. We went around noon on Labor Day and the parking wasn't a problem at all. The service was great...and the food was much better that I had expected (some urban legend about English food and all that has made me wary in general). It was so very good. I ordered the cottage pie pasty , my daughter ordered the veggie oggie and an order of 'chips'. We also ordered a 'to-go' 'bangers and mash' pasty for my wife - they offer to bake it halfway so it can be finished at home. My wife LOVED it. Overall, the pricing is very fair, and while the pasty isn't huge (like so much american-sized food) it was the perfect amount and kept my belly full for the rest of the day. I don't see any reason to give this less than five stars. The only thing that would have made mine better would have been a large glass of ice cold milk to wash it down with. Looking forward to giving the Cornish Pasty at try on a Friday/Saturday night - the bar looks terrific."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome here. The food was amazing, they have a great beer selection and we even got desert and that was equally amazing. We ordered the Chicken Asiago, Carne Adovado, the Oggie and the Greek Chicken. I am definitely a fan and will be back. Looks like this is going to be another stop on our tours for out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"I'm such a friggin' idiot that I just recently discovered this joint.   Hands down, my new favorite place to eat.  On our first visit, I tried the original 'auggie', which is essentially steak and potatoes.  It was fresh, hot, seasoned perfectly and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  A decent cut of meat and it went along perfectly with the red wine sauce pairing.  The wife had the chicken pot pie and loved it.  The proverbial cherry on the top was the dessert PB&J sangwhich.  Best.thing.ever.  Oh and they have a great beer menu.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! very cute place. Has 3 floors based off what kind of atmosphere you want, which i thought was pretty cool! very pub-ish feeling, but with a romantic touch. The food was very yummy, different concept which I loved! We had the Chicken Tikka pasty & the Peppered steak pasty along with a couple of glasses of wine & of course had dessert - chocolate bread & butter pudding with ice cream. I highly recommend it if you are in downtown phoenix!"}
{"text":"New to downtown great vibe upstairs and a basement. The mood is casual and free pool upstairs. Friendly staff and great atmosphere all together. Need to visit this place. It will stay on my list to frequent."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. ...extremely good! What they do, they do well. It will leaving you craving a pasty...matter of fact I'd love another one right now! I'm glad they've opened the second location closer to us. You should definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"I do not know what to say. I love Pastys!!! And for get about the dessert. Soooooooooooo good."}
{"text":"To call these tasty pasties fancy hot pockets is an utter travesty, mates. They are so much better than a hot pocket. They're simply the bee's knees! Since the restaurant upgrade (from just a tiny hallway) there is much more space available and the patio is quite brilliant for groups! The atmosphere is moody so when British New/Dark Wave from the 80s plays it feels rather fitting. Service here can be a tad rubbish at times. My last visit I was a bit gutted because it seemed like they were out of a lot of items. Oh, bollocks! I suppose that's what I get for waiting until midnight to grab nosh and a pint. However, no matter what I order at Cornish, the grub is always smashing. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Cool atmosphere, great food and awesome service. The prices are decent and there are plenty of vegetarian options. It's a chill place to grab dinner and a drink.   Also, the deserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday,  and I loved it.  I called a few days ahead to make a reservation,  but when I arrived and told them I had made a reservation they looked at me like I was crazy,  but they had enough space for us all so that was fine.  The food was a good price,  drinks were a good price.  The server was very attentive and was able to manage out large party perfectly (I was also wearing a Sailor Neptune outfit and she knew that right away,  dorky I know,  but it was a cool touch for me,  lol)  I will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for us when we're in AZ. The newly expanded area is a plus, but we usually try to go right before lunch to avoid a rush. And helps w/ food time - but trust me the wait is worth it! I've tried several pasties - shepherds pie is one of my favs! Sit at the bar and watch them work - so neat!"}
{"text":"I can't rave about this place enough.  Not expensive, great vibe, great music, communal or private seating, tons of food options.  My favorite pasties are the Mexican, the Chicken Portobello, and the Royale with Cheese.  Also, you REALLY can't skip the Banoffee Pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"I was here for the 1 yr anniversary. Very cool spot. Live bands, good food and booze. I had a classic sheppards pie and it was nice. Savory and piping hot the serving size was generous. Great crust as well.  The bar was packed but staff was excellent and we never had to wait for a drink. Very accommodating to our party. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"First visit here.  Coming from England the Cornish pasty was amazing. I had the lamb and mint filling and my wife's first time eating a pasty and she loved it.  Came with good size portion of chips and some good old Heinz beans.   Great service, chilled atmosphere.   Recommend to people visiting from UK and first time pasty tasters."}
{"text":"Be still my heart, this place has awesome comfort food and personality to spare! I am in love with the cream of leek, potato and stilton soup that our server recommended (this came with amazing fresh warm bread-sigh). The pasty's are also amazing, I suggest that you share one unless you are feeding a college kid that loves leftovers, the portions are huge. Go NOW. I prefer the decor at the Tempe location, but the vibe at the Scottsdale location is rocking on a weekend night. Great food and great casual fun."}
{"text":"I grew up eating pastys, prepared by my Grandmother and Mother.  The food served here is every bit as good as those wonderful meals from years ago.   6 of us visited this location for lunch, everyone of us had a delightful lunch regardless of what we ordered.  I an sure that you would be hard pressed to find a Cajun or Mexican pasty in Cornwall or Wales, they are excellent entrees served here.   Advice:  Allow time for baking the Pastys, I not sure of the logistics at CPC, but it takes some time to bake a pasty even if prepared ahead.  This is not Subway, add that they recently opened and are still making changes to the building service will be slower than a Fast food place.   Yes, Pastys are a lot of dough, and it's substantial.  It needed to hang together being carried down into a tin or coal mine.  An 'official' pasty is closed on the side rather than the top, and this rim is used as a handle and not usually eaten.  CPC closes dinner pastys on top and dessert ones on the side, Mom's were always the opposite.  One suggestion, pre-cook or use fully ripe apples, they were a little under done. This is really good food, eat in or takeout.   Plan ahead to leave enough time to enjoy you meal, or order to go and finish baking at home.  Really great food!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite food place in Vegas! This little hole in the wall restaurant serves up the most amazing food! It is a true diamond in the desert! While I have not had a pasty I didn't like my favorite is the Eggplant Parm and for desert the Banoffee or Peanut Butter banana pasty."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. It's finally open. My husband and I have loved Cornish pasty for so long and were so happy there is finally one close to home. If you are asking yourself, \"what is a pasty?\" Just think of the most fancy and delicious hot pocket with fine and gourmet ingredients that your brain can handle, and multiply its deliciousness by 1000. And then you're close to a dish from here. Just go. You will love it. And have a banoffee after!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. It's a great place for me and my husband since I'm vegetarian and he's a meat eater. They have a wide variety for both sides and I believe they always offer a couple vegan options as well.   My favorite is the Veggie Mexican (Quorn brand \"ground beef\", egg, jalapeno, potato & cheese) and he loves the Royale with Cheese which is pretty much a cheeseburger and fries wrapped up in a delicious crust! We each usually have half a pasty leftover for lunch the next day if I can keep myself from overstuffing myself because it's so good. You also definitely have to try the Banoffee Pie(graham cracker crust with banana, homemade caramel & whipped cream). My mouth is watering just thinking about it! They also have a pretty big selection of beers I've never heard of if that's your thing!   The space is pretty small but I feel it kind of adds to the ambiance. My only complaint is that it's so far away. We need one in North Phoenix!  GO EAT AT CORNISH PASTY NOW!!!! (and bring me your leftovers!)"}
{"text":"Come here a lot and always have a good time. Not today! We were seated and gave a drink order because I didn't know what I wanted. The server took forever, disappeared and came back with water, no beer.   Moved to the bar, ordered three things and a beer. Barman forgot one of the lunch items so had to come back and ask again and totally forgot my beer.   Food was good, not excellent and  the service was terrible. It's a bit of a trek from where we live so I doubt we'll make the effort again"}
{"text":"Had the roast beef sarnie pasty and the salmon pasty. I would have the roast beef sarnie 1000 times more...absolutely delicious. The salmon was a bit dry in the other, but I understand why given the time it took to bake the dough completely. The service was friendly and attentive and had a good joke ready when I pronounced the name of the dish incorrectly. The decor is really special in here, with church pews used for most of the seating. Haven't seen that in Vegas before! Happy it moved to the 18b area and look forward to returning. Also, appreciated their thorough veg focused menu! Love seeing more options for folks who choose to be more plant conscious with their food intake."}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere is perfectly in line with my personality.  Low lighting, great music, pretty chill staff. With that said, onto the food...  I have eaten here about 5 times or so now, and it has quickly become my go to place.  I love the PILGRIM, it's my favorite one, and a must try., also grab the Scotch Egg, and top it with a Guinness."}
{"text":"Two word review. Food poisoning.  Not a clean place and proof you can put bad meat in a pie and sell it to consumers."}
{"text":"Amazing change up for a Saturday night. This place is about a half mile from the stratosphere casino. So if you are staying on the North end of the strip, then this place is a quick commute and worth the detour. We started with the Tandoori chicken wings, which came with a nice mint tzatziki sauce and veggies on the side.  Yum perfectly seasoned. Next we dove into a Shepard pie and peppered steak pasty. Both where super crispy and filled with savory goodness. The menu here is a decent size and truly there was nothing on it that I think would not have been tasty! To wash down our pasties we tried the pilsnar and another grapefruit smelling draft that was light and out of sight. To finish off our gastro adventure we opted for the sticky bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. Absolutely devine. The service was on point and very helpful with picking the hot items. Don't miss this British pub!"}
{"text":"Amazing in it's simplicity yet every pasty is remarkably different.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Okay, I had been pronouncing the name wrong for awhile.  I knew it was Not pronounced Paste-eee, (like what strippers wear over their nipples) but I said it that way anyway. Then one day someone eaves dropped on our convo, and corrected me. So now I say it right most of the time..  Anyway, this place is great.  Its cheap and its good.  The last time I came I had the Oggie.  Its one of their traditional pasties.  It has steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy.   I am always attempting different pasties everytime I come. And every single one has been great so far.  Hubby had the Cajun Chicken and that was good.  Their pasties run from $8-9.50.  You get a nice portion size and if you really feel like sharing you can do with one.  But I recommend getting your own and doing a nice switch with one half of your pasty.  Much more fun that way and worth the calories!  It has expanded since the last time I was there.  So if you walk in and see that cramped area where they do all the cooking; keep walking and you will see that it opens up to a nice spacious area.  We learned the hard way.  After sitting for awhile, we were watching the cooks take out pasty after pasty.  We kept looking around, wondering what the hell?!  We thought we were the only ones.  But I finally decided to see what was up, lo and behold!  A whole new section.  Overall a wonderful place"}
{"text":"Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.  With restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.  If you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.  As soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.  The first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.  The Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.  Never able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.  The Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.  Cornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their homemade bread and their broccoli cauliflower cheese bake as I've never actually eaten anything else on the menu.  Their homemade bread is fabulous!  I'm one of those who prefers side items to entrees in most cases and I love their broccoli/cauliflower side and homemade bread.  I get them every time we order from here.  They make a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I guess I really don't understand the amount of reviews and stars this place has received. Service wasn't anything to rave about, the facility was a bit dank, the seating outside was very uncomfortable, and the pasty I had was definitely nothing to run home and tell mom about. I'd understand the ratings if the prices per pasty weren't 9+ dollars, it'd be a cool place for college kids to get an ok sized hot pocket for a decent price, if they were more like 4 dollars.     I ordered the bangers and mash, steak/sausage and mashed potatoes wrapped in a crust. Not sure what expect from that, but it tasted just as it sounds. Again, I'll reiterate, not worth the price per pasty and definitely not a 4.5 star establishment nor a 4.5 star product."}
{"text":"To start I will say, this place is fantastic. That being said, the service is just OK. I have never had bad service but I have had mediocre service; long waits for easy things like refills, and forgotten order items, but all that can just be a fluke. I am in love with the food and even the people there. Everyone is cool to be around and no one is rude.   There aren't substitutions or \"create your own\" options, but as an extremely picky eater, if you can't find a pasty you like, you should probably go to burger king and have it your way.  Also the beer menu is great for Beer snobs, and welcoming enough for average beer drinkers alike. I don't drink wine, but it looked like a long list of options.   All in all this is a near perfect establishment. If you are looking for a unique place to take someone and fill up on home cooked flavors, this is the place in Tempe. I happen to prefer the N Scottsdale Rd. location, but to each their own."}
{"text":"This is a must when in Phoenix! I loved it all, the service, the environment and of course the food! We had a Greek salad (crisp, fresh and healthy) the peppered steak pasty (delicious, big enough to share) and the peanut butter and jelly dessert pasty (to die for) Highly recommended"}
{"text":"love this place!  traditional pub style place with lots on tap including Strongbow Cider.  I went with the Bit Burger Pilsner and a peppersteak pasty and it was awesome as usual."}
{"text":"The food is always great but tonight the service was just horrible.  Erik our \"server\" came by maybe once. Our salad came out with the food and our soup after all that.  My husband had to go to the bar for our drinks since he never came back for our drink order. Going back for food but hopefully another server."}
{"text":"Both Cornish Pasty Companys are great restaurants.  I have yet to order any of their fare and not like it.  Although the food is scrumptious, the ambience is the major draw of these restaurants.  It is a warm and friendly place to hang out, enjoy great food, and spend quality time with your friends."}
{"text":"Omg the most delicious pasties! I split the traditional pasty and chocolate bread desert with my husband. We were both stuffed at the end, and very satisfied. Dessert is enormous, we couldn't finish. I will definitely be back.  Want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Dude, I am like Lil' Jon guest backin up Usher with this place \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!\"  Friends have been telling me this place is fantastic for months, but I think my imagination of this place hindered me...I imagined a dirty beige dining room with blue checkered table cloths, rickety wooden chairs, like, MOM art on the wall, and cutesy crap with bad beer and hot pocket like \"treats\". Some late times at Time Out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the Vegan Pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. At 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, I was STOKED. I woke up the next morning, counting DOWN THE HOURS till I could dial that number for the vegan goodie. She recognized my voice, and I didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-I ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies.   My companion picked me up, and its on the HARDY side of the University and Hardy, fyi. We walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. Dude...were we in the right place? This place was SLEEK-black and white decor, clean, hip, I mean, like URBAN chic man, but not pretentious. Since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends.   The real star of this story is really the Pasty-I learned I could add some Quorn (the best meat substitute EVA), but that was ok. My food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. Not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, I mean, there was nothing wrong with it-NOTHING. Like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? Yeah? Yeah? This is the bomb. AND even though I was starving, I could barely finish it, but I felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all.   I even have their sticker on my CELL PHONE to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right. I fucking BLINGED my cellie with Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"Was in town for the Great American Foodie Fest. Went in with my crew & was surprised by the hipsterish vibe. Our waitress Kasie was upbeat & attentive. The Guinness pasty was so delicious paired with my draft Boddingtons. Thanks AZ for not disappointing!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have seen any other Cornish pasty places around so it is hard to rate this place but they were pretty good! The original is good but I preferred the more unique ones such as the mexican or chicken masala. It is a little pricey but it's certainly a one of a kind place around here."}
{"text":"Food was a five, service was a three.  Way understaffed, but if you don't mind the wait the food is unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"First time we came here, I was a little scared lol. The setting is dark and a little tattered but the food made up for it! This is my second time here and while the food is still delicious, I'm disappointed that we ordered 40 minutes ago and only my daughter has her food because another server gave ours to another table! Now, we have to wait for ours to be prepared, guess I'll get it to go now. Maybe next time, the server can pay better attention. I was wondering how the table that got our food had theirs before us and we were the first people here today!"}
{"text":"Killer spot. When I was traveling through Phoenix I got recommended to hit this place up for dinner. I was very stoked to get introduced to this place. It had a feel that it belongs in Portland. I never thought I would find s place like this in Arizona. Do not miss out on this spot and hit it up. My only problem is that I don't have this place in my home town."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. Drinks were great and the food was up to par. Flaky crust and great filling. My friend and I had a great night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok so I don't know whom I should be exactly pissed at here...   Yelp....my neighbors....citysearch....  HOW HAVE I NOT FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE?????  Okay Yelp, I can't be mad at you because your little mobile application showed me what was close to me for lunch when I was down in Tempe at the Japanese market buying some Echigo beer which I discovered while at Yasu.  Amazing, simply amazing, I saw the outside of this place and was like, \"well here we go, another smokey pub filled with old timers\"  But as I passed through the front door I felt as if I had been magically transported to somewhere back east, a hustling bar with employees shouting orders and pressing fine pasterys and a decor that would make even Gordon Ramsay proud.  I had the traditional being that I've never had a \"patsy\" before and it was simply amazing, beef, potatoes and a red wine gravy that made my mouth go, um what the hell just happened?   They have a huge variety and it was really cool to see one of the kitchen members sitting next to me trying out one of the new recipes and critiquing on it.....huge brownie points in my book..   Best part, 10 bucks for lunch including a 3 dollar tip. SCREW YOU ECONOMY! I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was originally going down the block for some Filipino food but decided to reroute and found myself at Cornish pastries. walked in and sat at the bar. atmosphere was a little different than I'm used too. they have church bench seating for larger parties or community seating. nice selections of beers. Menu is not too big n not too small. Bartender was friendly and helpful with suggesting her faves and what customers like. I asked for banana beer but was told they were out but when I looked up I found it myself. No big deal as long as the food is good right? I decided on the asiago chicken and chips w/ cheddar n jalapeño. Asiago was spot on, bomb.com, delicious with my dogfish IPA to push it down and chips to snack on. this place definitely interesting and delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"this go-around, i ordered the cottage pasty, vegetarian. filled with quinoa meat and lots of potatoes and veggies. it was divine. the wife and i split the banana desert with graham cracker crust and caramel drizzle....caramel dollop that is.   super rich and sweet. it was delicious but i felt my teeth hurting afterwards. we'll go a little more savory next time!  still an awesome place with over excellent service."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!  Loved everything about this place. I had the Cottage Pie and my friend had the Cheese Steak and both were excellent. Little confusing to find and looks closed from outside but worth the confusion!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Flying in late last night from Chicago, I took this opportunity to eat outside.   Their \"house rule\" of being allowed to smoke on the patio after 10 pm; however, ruined the delicious pasty taste and my experience. It is also not legal and it will be reported."}
{"text":"I came to Cornish Pasty with the fam, all of whom had already been and promised me, the first-timer, that it was absolutely delicious. I trust my uncle with his wine suggestions, my aunt with her food ideas, and my mom with my life, so surely they would not steer me wrong, no?  They were all right (and Mom, T, G, if you ever read this, enjoy the \"you were right\"!) as Cornish Pasty was absolutely frikkin' delicious. For starters, their vegetarian options were extensive. I have never seen so many veggie options at a place that the fam described as \"meat pies, but they'll probably have something for you.\" After careful consideration of the menu (and updates from the waiter on what was available), I chose The Greek (veg). Along with our pasties, the table split a few orders of fries. My pasty was soooo good with all my favorite parts of Mediterranean food wrapped up in a hot crust. Emphasis on hot. I had to wait a few minutes to be able to eat my pasty without burning my tongue!  Now, note that we came on a Sunday night, meaning that after a busy day, some options were out of stock, much to my cousin's chagrin when his Scotch Egg was not available. You're better off maybe not coming after a super busy day if you want as many options as possible to choose from. Our waiter was super upfront and apologetic about it, though. He was also tops in cross-checking with the kitchen staff as to which, if any, pasties contained coconut, coconut milk, oil, etc. due to an allergy.   I foresee many family dinners here in the future, so I look forward to eating my way around the vegetarian menu. Hope you enjoy CP as much as my fam does!"}
{"text":"This was good grub though parking was a pain.  I had a greek salad, soup and a pasty that were tasty."}
{"text":"Haven't had a Pasty since my last visit to Lead/Deadwood,. South Dakota. (where they used to sell them to the miners of the Homestake Gold Mine).  Chose the OGGIE....the original...it was perfect, hearty, and delicious. I will definately be back!."}
{"text":"So I guess a month ago they moved? CLOSER TO ME!!!:) Totally not upset with that move. Love that I am able to get here faster and closer now. If you have not been here before well you should.  This place has a very hipster / trendy vibe going on. The clientele looks great in there. Right when u walk in now there is large party seating to the right, smaller party seating to your left and a massive bar that connects the full service bar to the bar where the staff preps the food so you can watch. The prep area is very open.   We sat down at the bar. I have had this bartender at the old location but can't remember his name because it wasn't even on the receipt but he was tattooed heavily and had a massively rad beard. He was awesome. Knew his stuff and his beers so great interaction with the staff there. He let me sample a few beers and I always appreciate that.   We started with the Scottish egg. Which seriously is my new favorite appetizer. No joke. It's a hard boiled egg covered in sausage and bread crumbs served with a mustard sauce. It was so good I had to order one to go. By the way when I said I took it to go I meant it made it half way down the street on the walk home and it was gone :) whoops   I had the Cajun Pastie it had Cajun chicken, bacon,  ham and Swiss with a chipotle sauce. The sauce was not good honesty so I used the mustard sauce from the appetizer to dip it in. Better move. The pastie itself was great. My partner said he wish he got another one to try but he said this one was great. Just wouldn't get it again. I would get it again but there are so many pasties I haven't had I think I can spare getting another.  I will most defiantly be back. I'm happy I can walk here in 20 minutes. Maybe a host on would help. We stood there for a little wondering where to go. Other than that no complaints at all and I love that :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I love this place. Literally everything on the menu is delicious. Although to be honest, I have only tried their pasties and their deserts. I know that they serve salads, I just think that is a waste of a meal, and i can make a pretty excellent salad at home. I switch between the vegetarian and the meaty versions fo their pasties and they are both delicious. So vegetarians, have no fear.   The drink specials are very nice as well. I like to get the enormous mug/pitcher of hard cider with my meal. SO GOOD!  I was very happy when they expanded. Sometimes it could be hard to get a table. I'm looking forward to them opening up the patio. I am not sure if that is complete yet."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing. I had the vegan balsamic portobello with dahlia mozzarella. So good. And great beer to go with it. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Good eats--if you order the right one! There are tons of pasties (like a calzone in a pastry crust) to choose from, but go with the rosemary chicken or the thanksgiving (is that the name? turkey, stuffing, cranberries, you get the picture) and you won't be disappointed. Save room for dessert, though, as the banofee pie is amazing (graham cracker crust coated with a thick layer of caramel, covered in mounds of house-made whipped cream and topped with bananas). YUM!"}
{"text":"Great food-I really enjoyed the Guinness stew pasty.  Unfortunately, it is a bit pricey ($24 for a pasty, beer and broccoli) and service was slow (1.5 hours for lunch) even though the place was not very crowded."}
{"text":"I try to stop in regularly because the vibe here is so amazing, yes its a little dark inside, maybe a little cramped too but the food is ridiculously delicious! I have tried a different pasty every visit and have yet to be disappointed. Every try was fabulous. The waitstaff is always on point and friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating this type of pasty so my review may or may not be helpful.    The pastry part was tender and flaky but the filling was way too salty for me.  I got the Eggplant Parmesan.  I was in Arizona for a wedding and I wanted to try some local fare so I ended up here. Although it was an interesting experience, if I visit Arizona again, I will not be eating at Cornish Pasty"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here because there was a large piece of glass in my cup and I had told the manager and my server both of which did nothing after about 20 minutes I kept telling him it was an issue and they finally brought their attention to see if they could help me with my situation. I could have choked in this piece of glass and that could have caused a really big problem. The food is pretty good however due to the fact that the service was so negligent impassive I don't think I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Over rated! Doesn't compare to the pasties of the U.P. over priced for what you get too. I don't think I'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC.  I've never been disappointed.  Great food-great atmosphere-try it for yourself you won't be disappointed.  I've never left this place without feeling uncomfortably full."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, and they had a surprisingly solid beer selection for a small place."}
{"text":"I've been back twice this week. What a treat, highly recommended. Everything is made fresh to order, eat at the bar and watch them make the Pasties ! The old location was run down and small, the new one is great, plenty of seating and easy to get to. They have a huge selection of dishes for both meat eaters and vegetarians.  Well worth the trip for any foodie visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"A staple of Tempe. If you visit ASU town and don't come to Cornish, you effect up, bro.   Gotta get the Mexican Pasty! Very bomb. And the Reuben.. my absolute favorite.   They've got vegan options and killer happy hour specials too.. $5 car bombs? Sick!"}
{"text":"We love this place and go as much as we can on weekends. Love the tandoori wings and you will not find a Pasty you won't like. The problem is trying to pick one, they have a huge menu. Great beers on tap too. Large outdoor seating is nice too."}
{"text":"If Brits immigrated to Phoenix to try their hand at making Hot Pockets in a dimly lit bar, you get this."}
{"text":"Every time I order to-go here I always have to wait an additional 15-20 minutes after I've already given them 25 minutes to prepare the food. One time I waited for 45 minutes and this is of course after giving them about 20 Minutes to prep the food (yes that is the estimate they give too). However,  they do have tasty food. My favorites: garlic fries, mushroom soup, chocolate bread pudding with ice cream and crémé anglais (although sometimes they forget this part of the dessert when I ask for it), and the eggplant Parmesan pasty. But, please, work on your to-go orders! Just make them and don't make people wait THAT long, especially after we came within the time frame that you said it would be ready!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! It was a little hidden, but I was so determined to try these pasty things! Well worth it, let me tell you. Everything was super flavorful and everyone was super friendly."}
{"text":"The first time I had a pasty was while I was in Bath, not far from Stonehenge. Fast forward a few years, I'm told of Cornish Pasty Co. Dang, these things are the best! I typically call in my order and by the time I arrive (10-15 mins.) it is all ready for me to take home. Oddly, I usually do this on days when I'm hurting from a terrible hangover. Their menu, which is available online, has so many options and they all seem freaking incredible. However, when I'm hungover I usually want something very filling and comforting. So the very first pasty I called in was a shepherd's pie, then I'm asked if I want lamb (a true shepherd's pie) or beef (a cottage pie). Lamb, of course! It was so delicious it's the only one I've ever gotten. I just can't seem to bring myself to deviate and that's not really like me, especially when everyone raves about all the others. Someday. I'll surely be going back, maybe one day I'll actually eat there and enjoy the ambiance and maybe, just maybe I'll try something new. This place rocks! The service is great and they're all so friendly!"}
{"text":"Food is fun, anything you want wrapped in a thin flaky crust.  Pizza, fish, steak, veggies.. You name it they put it in a pocket of crust!   Beware the place is LOUD and food takes a min on the weekends, but this is a great place for you and your friends to grab a beer on Friday night and laugh the work week away."}
{"text":"Man that was tasty, great price great service. Need to open one in Christiana Delaware thanks"}
{"text":"To start, the only reason I found about Cornish Pasty Co. was through great yelp reviews.  It turned out to be near right near my work so me and a coworker went over during lunch.    The first thing I noticed was the extensive menu.  There were so many options and I personally really had trouble making my decision.  I finally went with the lamb and mint pasty.  We sat down and after 30 minutes our pasties was still not out, so we decided to get them as take out instead  After taking them to go, we found the pasties to be very delicious, but still the restaurant deserves only 3 stars.  The order took too long to make (I understand it's specialty restaurant, but 30 minutes for lunch is too long for the dish to come out).  Then, when we did the take out instead, the waitress did not give us utensils.  Also, the meal was around $12 which I believe is a little expensive for lunch.  I might be back because the pasty was delicious in the end, but I think I need to lower my expectations on the customer service and cook time of this establishment."}
{"text":"Fantastic little hot pocket. I really love the crust and the stuffing inside. I have ordered a few and I think my favorite is the one with the steak. Forgot what it was called. But u can't go wrong. It's delicious! Don't be fooled by the entrance. Once u go inside. It's like another world."}
{"text":"What I experienced here is definitely not for the health conscious, but I did see salads on the menu. I opted for the Royale Pasty, which is basically a hamburger in pasty form. The food took a while to make it's way to the table, which is understandable because it is baked. My Royale was nine bucks and is served ala carte. No salad or fries on the side here, however, the Royale is made with fries on the inside. With a drink, lunch was north of twelve bucks, excluding tip. The service was good and the drinks were never empty. The atmosphere was nice with some classic rock 'n roll playing throughout. Looks like they've got a nice selection of beers on tap too! I'd put it at three and a half stars, but have to round to the nearest whole number. Good enough to round up for an even four star rating."}
{"text":"I ordered what I wanted and they came back and said they were out. We ordered again and again they came back and said they were out of both of those too. Then they would not let us change anything with any of the items (my friend was lactose intolerant and I didn't want tomato etc) This place suckkkkks I'd never go back."}
{"text":"Great place! Some of the best off the strip food I've ever had in Vegas. I had the shepherds pie pasty and garlic chips. The garlic chips are the best I've ever had. Try this place now."}
{"text":"TASTYEEE! I tried the cajun chicken pasty & it was delicious! Great flavoring on the chicken rub and I love that it was such a big size! Ended up taking 1/2 home for later. Since Im not a beer drinker I also love that they have a cpl ciders on tap. Loved the scrumpys! Shuffleboard table needs some sand but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is SUCH an awesome local's place. I was weary to try it because they don't do ANY substitutions with their food. However, the server helped me pick something that would work for me and it was absolutely spectacular. VERY tasty.  If you like fine dining, this is not for you, at all. This is a dark dive pub in a random part of town, but that's the beauty of it...it's hidden from tourists!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The Cornish Pasty is great, the ambiance is laid-back and cool, and the people are really welcoming and always remember regulars. It kinda has a Sons of Anarchy vibe. Also, I've hosted a few parties here and the team does a great job to get the food out at the same time and to accommodate everyone."}
{"text":"This place is great! I took my mom before a play and we didn't experience any of the slow service that others mentioned. The food was unique and tasty. We each picked a pasty of our choice and then split the mushy peas and roasted potatoes. Top it off with tapped hard cider and I was in oral heaven.  There was far too much food for two people to eat in one sitting. These little sandwiches are deceptively filling. And the incredible number of options from which to select from is a little mind boggling. My suggestion would be just to settle on one and then figure on a few return visits to round out the list.  Tables are tight, so this is definitely not a place to take the whole posse, but that's not a huge down-grade. The music is fairly loud and as I mentioned, I was there early, so I can only imagine that it must get really loud when the place is full. Amazingly, mom commented that she liked the music (who knew she was a Green Day fan) and thought the atmosphere was charming (not how I would have described it, but clearly its a place that is even parent friendly). She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...  A couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider?? (takes me to my happy place)!  This is a great unique food alternative for the down town Tempe area."}
{"text":"Food wise ... AWESOME all the way. Bring in a big appetite as these are very filling. I was stuffed despite of coming for late lunch and with a big appetite. I have never tried pasty before so I can not vouch for how authentic it is however our server explained this dish very well ... a pastry and calzone had a baby. I loved the fresh baked pasties.  The one star is taken away only because we went here for late lunch and the first 3-4 items we asked for were all over. Good sign I guess however I wish the server let us know before hand. Instead each time we asked for something the server had to go in come back again and tell us to pick something else. I will definitely come back to try the chicken tikka and lamb mint.   Anyways ... so in this visit we tried the Shepherd's Pie Pasty & Salmon with asparagus & dill pasty both were good but I liked the salmon one better since it was juicy and unexpectedly good. I have never had salmon calzone or pastry so I thought this was very innovative."}
{"text":"Not based on the food, since I've eaten at other locations many times and even ordered online. My review is based on the employee who thought it would be funny to talk like a jerk when I asked him a simple question about where to park. Dude you make pastry's. I know it must suck being you, but seriously change your attitude and stop trying to impress your coworkers by talking like an a hole."}
{"text":"First time I have a pasty! I called them the \"British version of an Empanada\" and that's the reason I really liked them ;-) I shared with a friend and we ordered half and half Guinness  stew and peppered steak Pasties. Both were DELICIOUS. We had a couple beers and we finished with a apple pasty + ice cream and a toffee + ice cream... Was heaven ! Haha"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a weekday evening.  Slight crowd, but not too busy so they were able to accommodate us.  The atmosphere was a dimly lit bar, but things were not what they seemed after food and drink were served.  The staff was really friendly.  Server explained menu and drink offerings.  I ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty as well as a Crispin hard apple cider to drink.  I expected this flakey goodness to be just empanada like, but it was much more of a hearty meal which surprised me.  I enjoyed tasting the warm sausage, onions, and mashed potato filling as well as dipping each bite in the gravy sauce.  The cider just complimented the pasty nicely and made a nice dinner."}
{"text":"You cannot find pasties like this anywhere, and they do so many different kinds it's crazy. Everything is great here. Believe it."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not a 5-star review is the horrid smell that started in the parking lot and wafted into the Cornish Pasty Co.  I don't know if a gas line had broken or if this was trash rotting in Commercial Center - whatever it was, it was extremely unpleasant.  That said, my pasty was a savory, delicious hot pocket/pot pie filled with portobello mushrooms, red pepper and cheese, all wrapped in a scrumptious crusty (but not too crusty) dough.  My very picky lunch date enjoyed her eggplant parm pasty and said she would be back again soon.  Not too many places in town where you can enjoy a filling lunch for $10 per person.  There were a lot of vegan and vegetarian options as well as the beef, chicken and pork pastys for my meat loving friends."}
{"text":"Great food, super nice staff and the atmosphere is really cool. Nice big place too. I highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to come in here for quite sometime now. My brother is a big fan and my good friend Steph has been recently praising it's glory. So we went in for lunch today. I had looked online at the website ahead of time at the menu and was impressed with the beer list, as well as the selection of pasties. I was expecting it to be all chicken-pot-pie and shepards pie but it was not the case. It's a very skinny joint with a small amount of seating. I did notice towards the back a booth, which would be great for a big group but parties of 2-4 is probably best. We started off with some beers, which was nice because the pasties take about 20 minutes to cook. Just enough time to quench your thurst and may I just say any place that can make a black velvet (not too many) from there draft is directly put on to my favs. I  appreciate it! I had the Chicken Takki Masala pasty. It was delicious! Perfectly spicy and flavorful, the colors were also fantastic! I did however wish there was more chicken it it, which was cooked and spiced to perfection (the potatoes were as well but the chicken was just wonderful).  Steph had the Greek Chicken pasty which was also delicious. I think next time I'll get one of those for myself. I will definitely be heading back here! Not only was the food good, but they had great tunes on, great service, and good-looking cooks!"}
{"text":"Wow... very flavorful Pasty! Never had one before I went here, and I was amazed by the amount of spices they put in my chicken pot pie pasty.  I figured since this was British food, it may be \"boring\" and not super flavorful.. but I was wrong. I had a nice white German beer there as well and it paired very well.  My girlfriend and I also split some \"chips\", they were like potato wedges... a lot of spices and flavor on those as well.  Nice place to take someone on a date for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely can recommend. We walked from a nearby hotel at lunch in 109° heat and were very glad that this fine restaurant was so close. I enjoyed an Old Fashioned ($9) as we read the menu and then ordered a delicious Cubano pasty ($12) and enjoyed the beer that our server, Lucy, recommended to go with it. My wife liked a Meet & Cheese pasty ($10.50) and an Au Bon chardonnay ($12). Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went with family including a kid after Sunday performance at the Herberger. Everyone was happy with their pasties even the kid who said she didn't like mushroom but eat the whole thing. Excellent beer choices and I had a really great cider. The place is large with room for darts and pool tables. Great family place with great food. Waitstaff was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is just great!!!!ample selection of both pasties and beer!!perfect combination!plus they have happy hour!cant get much better than this!!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised how tipsy I am whenever I leave this place. Not complaining. Just watch out for those 13% beers. They'll getcha.   When it comes to the pasty's, I typically am a meat and potato kinda chick so I lean towards those kinds. I love the pilgrim.   The soups and appetizers are all to die for, especially those little meat balls. Mmmmmmmmm  Bring your wallet, it's not a divey downtown shit hole by any means despite the location.  And you may want to have someone walk you out to your car if you're alone just because the area can get \"interesting\"."}
{"text":"One of the original gastro-pubs in Arizona.  Great beer, and even better food.  Can't say I'm a fan of the dessert pastys but the everything else is amazing.  You can get traditional ones such as shepard's pie, oggies etc. or you can tikka masala which is amazing.  The place is small and you have to be okay with having heavily tattooed/pierced servers wait on you.  The place is small, but comfortable.  I'd be happier if the music was more English but other than that I have no complaints!  Plus the pictures of coal miners are a bit depressing.   Due to seating constraints, I wouldn't recommend large groups, I'd say mostly two or three at the most."}
{"text":"I sense a little confusion in the concept.  The food is modeled after portable miner food, refashioned into gourmet hot pockets for college students. Mood is one part hip-two-years-ago, one part strip mall location, and one part coal miner attitude, assuming coal miners are generally grumpy and self(preservation) involved*, and don't care too much about kitchen discretion.  That's where I'm going to stop being critical, because it's such an honest, delicious meal they're serving up, and the price ain't cheap, but it's about right.  Selection - vegetarian and otherwise - will kinda blow your mind.  Excellent libation offerings have me further more likely to stop in again next time I'm in town.  *I don't know what coal miners are like, really.  I only have my photograph-driven notions.  And if I were a coal miner, I'd be grumpy."}
{"text":"A friend gave me a heads up on this this place and we dropped in for a late lunch to check it out.  We ordered beers and then I had the Oggie pasty and the wife had the Shepard's Pie.  When we saw our dishes we planned to eat half each and take the other half home for supper but once we got started we knew we were going all in.  Both dishes were simply excellent.  We added some strawberry/kiwi thing for dessert to finish it up.    Great food, fair pricing, hip interior, and our server was attentive, professional, and knowledgable about the food.  Well done.  Bonus:  We are Vegas locals and the quirky location and understated exterior make this a perfect place to take out-of-town guests, who tend to love off-Strip spots like this.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Love love Love great food, great people, great vibe, fun place play pool and darts. Vegetarian menu is very good as well."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this location isn't as good as the one further East.  I come here on occasion with co-workers for some good food and good beer.  The service is hit or miss, so is the food.  Even though I always order the same pasty, it doesn't always taste the same.  Once it was freezing cold on the inside and it was pretty disappointing so I had to send it back."}
{"text":"Lets start with location- a little hard to find. But thats not a huge deterrent. The building is obviously old, and because of that I think its hard to keep the place cool when its 111 outside. It was a little warm in there.   Now the food. I started with the leek soup and omg it was tasty! The hubby had the garlic jalepeno fries and they were meh. A little burnt with no real garlic taste and a few canned, chopped jalepenos dumped on top. The pasties were pretty darn good. I had the minted lamb. The hint of mint was evident but not overwhelming like it could have been. My husband had the bangers and mash. The sausage had a wonderful sage flavor and the dish on the whole was on point. I think that one was better than mine, but both were good. The red wine sauce was definitely as good as everyone says! The banana bread beer was ok. I didnt see what all the hype was about. Now for dessert! OMG!!! That banoffee pie!!! There is something magical about that caramel. Im surprised more people havent raved about it! The sticky toffee pudding was on point as well! Yummy!  Now service- I dont typically comment on service or factor it into an overall rating, but it was a little awkward. The guy wasnt too friendly, nor was he attentive. Not horrible, but just awkward is all I can say. I felt a little uncomfortable asking for anything."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life?!  Will you please open a place in Phoenix metro area!?  Better yet, a Pasty stand outside in downtown Phoenix would be awesome!  Yelpers, this place is delicious, has A+ service, all in a wonderful, chilled atmosphere.   They have a pasty for any taste!  Dessert was off the charts!  Go try it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat. Very yummy pasties and you can wash them down with a nice selection of good beer. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here on New Year's Eve day. Always a good vibe inside. Went upstairs play some pool in order some beers. Very cozy and dim environment.  First time I'm trying to food over here. I got the spicy Asiago chicken Pasty and I also tried the carne adovada Pasty.  I really like the carne adovada Pasty as opposed to the spicy Asiago chicken. The port in the carne adovada was really juicy and flavorful. You get a side of sour cream and salsa, which I just lather onto the Pasty. Would definitely recommend trying the carne. The spicy Asiago chicken was okay, I'm but I'm not too big into the Hatch Chiles, and there was less flavor with the chicken compared to the pork. Wasn't really spicy in my opinion.  Spicy Asiago chicken was around $10.50 + tax*  The carne adovada was $12 plus tax.  Really like the free pool tables that they have upstairs, easy way to pass the time. Also good window seating upstairs.  The Waitresses were super friendly and attentive.   Come check this place out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique restaurant, delicious food, a cool chill atmosphere, and a place that is open late, this is where you want to go. It's the perfect relaxed date spot, or putting for a group of friends.   First of all, the food is amazing! A Cornish pasty is sort of like an empanada meets a calzone, and the filling is representative of a popular dinner dish. Basically, back hundreds of years in England, they used to serve pasties as a way to provide a full rich meal to the miners. The meal, which usually was potatoes and meat on one end and sweet filling on the other, was baked inside bread with a crimped side for ease of holding it. This made it so they didn't need plates, and the crimped end made it so the dirty miner hands had somewhere to hold without getting all the food dirty. Anyway, Cornish pasty took the idea, and made it gourmet, with tons of varieties of pasties with some having mashed potatoes and steak or hamburger and french fries. And they have a slew of vegetarian options. I think they can do gluten free, but you would have to call at least a day in advance. My personal favorites is the Bangers and Mash and the Spicy Asiago Chicken. I also highly recommend the red pepper soup with fresh homemade bread.   The prices are reasonable, and the location is downtown next to some fun downtown businesses.  They have a great beer selection. The restaurant is huge, and has an area more bar-like and one more restaurant-like. You can also snag a nice table next to the window."}
{"text":"First time trying this place! Not from the area, but I thought the idea is very unique. I compare it to an American version of an empanada. I was trying to be healthy so I ordered the chicken tikka salad. The dressing for the salad is a yogurt sauce. I thought the sauce wasn't that flavorful in the salad. I think it was because the salad was more wet so the yogurt dressing was pretty diluted when mixed in. The chicken in the salad was pretty good and moist. I guess this place wasn't known for salads so I think next time I would get what they are known for. My friend got the bangers and mash. It was so good. The mixture of sausage and mashed potatoes made it taste really good. The sausage was well spiced and marinated. They included a sauce/gravy on the side but it was not necessary. The whole thing was super flavorful and good. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Holy wow! So amazingly good. I brought a group of coworkers here from up north and they were skeptical until they saw the menu, amazed when the food hit the table, and thanked me profusely when we had finished. The variety of menu choices is astounding and each pasty is better than the last. I've been coming for years and remember when it was a teeny tiny place with a couple of tables and a bar. The restaurant is beautiful, wait staff attentive, and the food is not to be missed. Do yourself a favor and order a side of garlic mashed potatoes for the table."}
{"text":"Oh my this is good food - like the different treatments for wings and of course the Pasties..."}
{"text":"At first I thought, how could a business sell only pastys and survive? And then I had one. And now I find myself craving them constantly. So good. glad it's expanding though because it's very cramped at the moment."}
{"text":"Didn't even get any cornish pasty's here but let me tell you one of their specials:  $4 Irish Car bombs.    We were supposed to go bar hopping afterwards but the night started and ended here...and I mean ended.  Service was a bit slow when it got crowded (1 bartender running the whole show) but it was all good.  Funny what $4 ICBs can do.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Update:  I had their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It's $12. They cut it in half for you so you can share with someone if you'd like. It wasn't big but half made me full. It's salmon that's marinated. It comes with sautéed asparagus, roasted tomatoes, spinach, and red potatoes. It was the perfect combination. Not one ingredient was more powerful than the other. It all blended well together. The crust was kind of too dry but if you put sauce on top of it, it's amazing. You have to pour the sauce over the pasty because it crumbles right away when you cut it. The salmon was great. It was cooked right. I definitely recommend this dish to anybody.     ------------------------------------------------------ This place has a really awesome venue! It's fun and can hold up a group of you have a large company. They have two pool tables and shuffleboard which are all for free!   We got their apple with ice cream. It was good. The crust was  cooked well and it had a good crunch to it. The ice cream was a basic vanilla so it was whatever. I would get it again. I just went for dessert.  I would definitely come back again and try more on their menu. I would love to bring a group here. I think it could be a lot of fun. The staff were great. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty....a more traditional Arizona fare simply does not exist in Tempe. When I bite into an Oggie, I imagine all the \"Cousin Jacks\" in the mines from Bisbee to Jerome eating their pasty and leaving the arsenic tainted crumbs to pacify the \"knockers.\"  Dean, a native Cornishman, has blessed Tempe with the perfect belly filling fare for students, workmen, and tourist. His gourmet twist on the classics with curry and vindaloo will satiate the most hard-pleased epicure.   Have a pint and a pasty soon, and see what you have been missing."}
{"text":"Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever!   but it was just perfect in ever way!!!   They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food....  its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :)   my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!!   i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing)   WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share....   My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine   we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves....   all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place...   i cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The place is small, great food and service I've had the Pilgrim and salad  and home made dressing was great! I want the recipe.   The service is always good and the drinks as well.  The Mesa location  we sat on the patio and it's bigger inside was a little loud."}
{"text":"Delicious, hearty, cheap eats on the way to the airport or when you're in the Tempe area.  Pasties are a British calzone-type food. I had the Shepherd's Pie and it was delicious. The beers are very inexpensive and quite worldly for Tempe, AZ. Even though their outdoor area is in a parking lot, it was pleasant and quiet on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while, having heard a ton of good things about it, and yesterday my wife and I finally made it in.  So so glad we did.  This is a cozy little pub with a great vibe.  There were a bunch of folks in here and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Great beer menu too!  After seating ourselves, we were promptly greeted and drink orders were taken and, we took about perusing the impressive menu of deliciousness.    My chose to try the traditional (aka the oggie) while I went with a bangers and mash pasty.  We also opted for an order of the garlic fries to share.  Everything was awesome. The fries were perfect and so so delicious, with just the right amount of garlic.  And the pasties.. oh the pasties.  They were so so so good. Probably one of the best things I've eaten in the last year.  I had a bite of the oggie, which was excellent. The potatoes and meat and other ingredients all complimented each other perfectly.  As for my bangers and mash pasty it was amazing.  The sausage and mash and seasoning were baked perfectly together in a delicious pastry. I just cannot emphasize how great this was. Just amazing.   All in all we loved our experience here.  We will be back often for more of these amazing pastys.  The menu is extensive, so I would imagine pretty much anyone could find something to like here, and we are looking forward to trying everything they have on offer.  They've also got some great sounding deserts, but we were too full from our meals to sample them today.  We'll definitely be back to try these as well though."}
{"text":"Pretty good!!!   I wouldn't hesitate from ordering again.  Both my husband and I are satisfied.  Got Greek one with tzatziki. Yummy!!!  Wish it was healthier.  Husband got bangers and potato and devours it."}
{"text":"Dark & dink, among the whispers and the music lies the CPC! -- Don Don Da....!  Halloween comes and it goes, but not the CPC. First thought was how dark and weird this place was when I first walked up and opened the doors!  What is this a vampire joint!?  Why so dark!?  I guess the sun will melt away the patrons.  I've heard about the meat pies of the CPC and finally made my way here.  I ordered The Oggie - The Traditional Pasty.  Not bad and very good to say, but I do recommend having it during the winter months.  It's pretty hot during the summer here in PHX if you haven't notice.  I would say the CPC is a seasonal restaurant and perfect during the cooler months.  Unless you need your meat pie fix!  Service was good overall and quick.  Needless to say they had more employees that day then Vampires. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I wasn't sure what I was getting into coming here.  Co-Workers took me here and I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was described to me as a bread with your choice of filling.  Pretty much a big fancy Hot Pocket.  I didn't know what to order because everything sounded good.  I ordered, I think the Roast Beef Sarnie and my friend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala.  We ended up sharing the other half of our pasty with each other to get a taste of the different fillings.  To me, the Roast Beef Sarnie was good.  Nothing that jumped out and screamed wow.  I did like the Chicken Tikka Masala best.  It legit was full of that Indian flavor.  I would order that again.  The Broccoli and Cauliflower Cheese Bake was very good too.   So with that being said, Happy Eating's!"}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem and well worth the find! Do not let the location deter you from this food experience.    The service was impeccable. The waitress Dylan greeted us with a smile and took personal time to explain the food concept.  For drinks we had a non/ alcohol beer called \"Buckler\" and White Pomegranate  ice tea. Our meal started off with a garden salad served without a lemon pesto dressing, followed by an appetizer called \"Scotch Egg\". The main course was the Cajun  and Shepherd pie pasty. I took my husband and we sampled  these dishes together. We both had big grins on our face with each bite. The next time you are in Vegas and you want to hit the jackpot, take a drive off the main road and discover this pot of gold! Big shout out to the owner Scott Brunstetter and his amazing staff."}
{"text":"Eek!  This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a \"Meh, I've had much better experience!\"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something....   Service~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....  Food~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....  So for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!"}
{"text":"one of the best food in town.. their soups and the shepherds pie are awesome"}
{"text":"Well, I can say I finally say I've eaten at the highly regarded Cornish Pasty.  On the interesting scale, I'd give it a 5. The dark, pub-meets-art-museum (complete with church pews for seats) look of the inside is kind of neat. The servers, completely stereotypical hipster in appearance, all seem nice enough. The menu and food are very different than anything I've seen before.  We ended up ordering the Meat and Cheese pasty and the Mexican. Both were good, and came with the appropriate sauces.  If I have one complaint, it's that pasties are pre-made. So if you don't like a certain ingredient or are allergic to something, there's no ordering the pasty of choice without it; you'll just have to find something without it in it. It also makes me wonder how long some of the less popular pasties have to sit and wait to be ordered."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call this place our spot. Love the food & atmosphere. Comfy couch!"}
{"text":"Oh, so good. Bless you Dean Thomas for coming to the states and making your awesome food. My 2nd visit to AZ, also..My 2nd visit to Cornish Pasty. I had to come back and it did not disappoint. Had the Guinness Stew Pasty, so tender and tasty. HAD to finish with the banoffee pie, again did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"So I'm sure they're tired of being compared to Hot Pockets, but the best explanation I can come up with is gourmet hot pockets at their best. The food is absolutely killer here; I've tried four of the pasty's (pronounced liked nasty with a \"p\" not like tasty with a \"p\"-well at least that's what I've gathered from listening to the staff) and they've all been amazing. The best part is it isn't only the traditional meat cheese and potatoes. The options are all over the place and you can even bring your vegan friends. You can get a beer from the other side of the pond and the ambiance definitely feels like a good pub from across the Atlantic.  The only reason they aren't getting five stars is because my most recent visit; the bartender eating his dinner at the bar was clearly more important than my dinner. It's ok; it's not like with a hot meal I'd like to chase it down with a beverage of sort. The kitchen guys have always been extremely helpful and I appreciate them. The food is amazing enough and diverse enough to where I'll be back frequently, just hopefully not during my bartender's dinner time."}
{"text":"The flavors in the pastys burst in your mouth! Their service is excellent. I Love this place. This is a must go! Oh, a note about parking. Parking is on the street and sometimes a little hard to come by. I say be patient until you find one; its worth the trouble."}
{"text":"We don't have one in Tucson but if we did I would come at least once a week. The food was great. I had the offee and my wife had the the porky. Of the two the porky was the best.  If you're in Phoenix or Tempe and driving up from Tucson make sure you come here . You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Literally, anything your warm heart desires...into a pasty. Great comfort food and big enough to take the other half home for later. Ordered a veggie rosemary chicken and the hubby had a philly cheesesteak. They have an indoor restaurant, the grunge bar, and an outdoor patio with heaters. Waitresses were very friendly and fast. Highly recommend. Will come back to try other different pasties when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"You must eat here!!! When my son comes home from college, this is where he wants to eat. The Pilgrim Pasty (pronounced past-ee, not pastey) delivers Thanksgiving year round, and the Chicken Tikka pasty brings you all the way to India. Their scratch-made bread is the best we've EVER had, and it is even better when dunked in their potato-leek-cheese soup. But wait- there's more. You have to save room to share the Chocolate Bread pudding! They serve it with liquid cream or ice cream (or both) and we cry every time we finish it because we have just tasted heaven and have to go back to the real world. Just eat here and thank me later."}
{"text":"Ordered cornish pasty on door dash, the pasties were fine but when we took a bite of the banoffee pie, instead of whipped cream it was covered in sour cream. Called to tell them and their only response was it's impossible. Not impossible, very clearly sour cream in both taste and smell. They refused to acknowledge there was an issue, much less do anything about it. A very sour ending to our meal.  My guess is a lazy employee didn't feel like whipping the cream and grabbed the already creamy sour cream, putting that in the confectioners bag instead.   ,"}
{"text":"Over-rated, I tried this place 4 months ago was a bust nothing impressive. Tried it again today and still the same nothing changed. I will not try for a third time. I got chicken pot pie, lamb vindaloo"}
{"text":"Ambiance, service, food and drinks were all good. I tried the cheese steak pasty which was very good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went to the Phoenix Goldwater location just last week and couldn't get enough! It was fantastic. The Vegas location, however, is a big letdown. It's in a not-so-great part of town with a nondescript storefront bar. There is no dining room and the atmosphere is COMPLETELY different. If you like dark, rock music-filled dive bars, this is your place. The one server was the best! As for the food, only about half the selection as Phoenix (NO SCOTCH EGGS)! The oven chips were good, but loaded with so many jalapeños, I couldn't finish (and I'm usually good with heat). The pasties were much thinner than in Phoenix. Mine fell apart in my hand and that's not supposed to happen. The filling was great, though. I just think I'll wait to go back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Would get five stars but we had the worst I mean the worst waitress ever!!!! Tall long dark haired lady. There was 10 of us and two menus to go around asked a few times for more menus they never came. Also asked probably six times for a child booster before we got it. She also forgot one of our dinners and it took 15min to come out after everyone was done. I'm pretty sure she is completely stoned out of her mind!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Cottage pie pasty, it's the same as a Shepherds pie but with ground beef instead of lamb. It was pretty good! I loved the flaky crust and the cheese! I wish I had ordered a different one only because I discovered this isn't my taste. I'll be back though because it was still fresh and amazing even though I picked one that wasn't for me. SO MANY vegetarian and Vegan options as well! That's impressive! I will be trying those asap! I love the decor it's really fun and adds to the atmosphere, even though the church pews are not comfortable.   I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to try all the pastys!"}
{"text":"SO YUMMY!!! An excellent laid back environment. All employees were nice. I think he was the manager/owner with the red beard was super friendly. Can't wait to try every pasty on the menu. We had the chicken Alfredo and lamb mint both excellent. Only weird thing was that we didn't know what door to enter from and didn't know that we just seat ourselves."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch before the Cubs/DBacks game and I ordered the Shepherd's Pie with minted lamb while my husband ordered the Cajun Chicken pasty. Both were excellent and filling. The sauce/gravy were both perfect for the dish. The only change I would recommend would be a side of vegetables or something."}
{"text":"It's always really lively here, but I love it! The restaurant is very narrow and deep, if that makes sense. Service is great, but it can get busy.  I love pies and most of the pasties are kind of like handheld pies/calzones, but better! There is a myriad of fillings and flavors, including options for vegan, gluten-free, etc. The crusts are flaky and delicious.  There are other things on the menu too, but obviously, if you come here you have to order a pasty! I think they have a good alcohol selection too as a British pub, but I don't drink much so can't give an opinion on that.  Prices are not cheap but fair. The pasties are a decent size. Come here to try something different!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this one existed until recently. I like that it's consistent across the board at all locations so I won't have to worry about the quality. The only difference is really the seating arrangements.  This place is a little more spacious than the Mesa location. This time, I got the Mexican? Something to do with Mexican. Tasted pretty good and all my friends had a good time. I think there were about 12 of us and the waiter served us pretty well. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere, great prices. A little loud inside but a must try place in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating a Cornish Pasty and it did not disappoint. Every bite was a perfect blend of ingredients and bread -- making me feel just like Ben Wyatt from parks and rec and his love for calzones. The Cornish Pasty truly is the best delivery system for food.   Recommendation: get the Reuben and wash it down with a ginger beer. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"had the cajun chicken pasty..so delish! great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The amazing reviews drove us to try this place.  It was not as close to the ASU as we thought it was, but it's a pretty cool place with decent food.  A patsy is an English version of a calzone with a huge variety of fillings.  We had a Royal with cheese (cheeseburger), lamb with mint, bangers n mash and eggplant Parmesan.  All were quite good but nothing spectacular.  The Greek salad was delicious, as were the oven chips (French fries) with garlic.  Great selection of brews and a very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cornish is great and one of my top go-tos!  It is such a great concept and culture for a restaurant.  There are several locations in the valley and they all have a slightly different vibe with a laid back foundation. It's definitely a hipster crowd but not in a way that will make you sick to your stomach if you're not so hipster.  The tables are mostly long picnic table style which makes the scene effortlessly chill.  The menu concept is simple yet eclectic.  It's a menu full of pasties with so many variations for every taste bud out there.  There's the classic British ones and also some fun twists on Italian, Greek and Mexican flavors.  My favorite part of the menu is that they have a whole selection of pasties that are meatless and vegan.  They use meat substitute that tastes delicious!  It's a really nice treat for any vegetarians or vegans out there who are sick of eating salads at every restaurant.    I recommend visiting Cornish often and with all of your favorite people in life!  It won't let you down as long as your embrace it for what it is - inexpensive and chill"}
{"text":"We just moved offices and landed near the Tempe Cornish Pasty Co.  It's certainly an office favorite.  There is very limited seating so we usually go before 11:45 or after 1pm if it's a lunch rendezvous.  The food is amazing and unless you're from the UP, chances are you haven't had anything like it.  There are a ton of different pasty options.  Every time I look over the menu, it's like Christmas all over again.    Service can be a tad slow, but I realize that perfection isn't pre-made.  The beer selection is outstanding as well.  The staff is solid, very polite, and usually showcase a nice selection of body ink.  Don't be scared to try some apps or lighter fare.  EVERYTHING there is great.  Also, they offer half cooked Pastys.  So you can swoop in grab them and finish cooking at your leisure.  Although I usually like posting up a the bar and taking in the great crowd and atmosphere.    It's a weekly stop for me and I don't see that slowing anytime soon.  I also frequent the location in Mesa (corner of Dobson and Guad).  It's a much larger location with a slighty more upscale feel.  Same great food and service."}
{"text":"Visited them in December 2016 on my birthday. It was like a vegetarian haven for me when I looked at their menu. Loved the rustic godown ambience they have. Friendly server and great food.  I ordered one portion of mushroom walnut spinach soup and vegetarian chicken tikka masala pasty @ $10.25 and my husband ordered a chicken pasty Everything was delicious. When ever we are in Vegas again will surely visit this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what else can really be said, I just moved a few blocks from here, and it's really tough to avoid coming here every day. That's how much I love this place. The tandoori wings are amazing. I really wish they had bigger portions. The spicy chicken pasty is really great as well.   As far as ambience goes, I love the dark ominous vibe it has going on. It's ALWAYS pitch black in there. I don't know if that has anything to do with the lethal heat Phoenix has, but I love it. The service is always great, the staff is very friendly, the beer selection is good and reasonably priced, and Iron Maiden is always on the radio. Whats not to love?"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in PHX.  Hot Pockets and Beer?  Yes, please."}
{"text":"I will have give this one another try because I was not too thrilled with what I ordered. Good concept and a nice little hole in the wall place especially if you are on a budget like me :)"}
{"text":"We're a big fan of the Scottsdale location and we stopped here for lunch during Tour de Fat. The pasties are fantastic, although the waitress said they are discontinuing the Chicken Alfredo pasty, which is my favorite. I guess I'll have to find another favorite. Hubby likes the Chicken Vindaloo pasty. Scotch eggs are also delicious. The crust on the pasties is awesome- just right to hold together without being too heavy. Service at this location was fast and friendly even though it was pretty crowded and we were out on the patio. Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"this place is great---they have a few places in Arizona---then they moved here --and this place is great---so now they are going to open another place in town----the staff is great and love the waitresses cute////////////marcella"}
{"text":"Wowwwwwww, definitely coming back for more! Sure, it comes off as hole-in-the-wall, dark, and a little sketchy, but don't be afraid! Great beer and heaven stuffed in buttery, flaky crusts awaits you beyond Cornish's doors. Staff was generally not too friendly, but one of the many dudes with huge plugs is cool.   Come with a group of people so you can enjoy dessert. I almost died eating two pasty's by myself."}
{"text":"I've been here once and really like the atmosphere. I had my first pasty there which was something with pesto, delicious, and angel sauce! It'[s a local spot for me, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and I got the chicken pot pie pasty today. DELICIOUS. Such a homemade feel to it, and my partner got the Cajun chicken pasty. We are both satisfied with this food and the new location. It looks really trendy and will most likely get more business now that they're in a better area."}
{"text":"After multiple visits and having tried their other offerings, I'm upgrading my rating of Cornish Pasty Co to five stars. Last night it turned out my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I couldn't even touch dessert (the very appropriately named strawberry pavlova) until this morning; a Porky and mushy peas was all I needed for 12 hours straight.  My new life goal is to eat one of everything Cornish Pasty makes. I might die in the process, but I'll die happy."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing!    1) I love a place with an open kitchen.  It makes me feel better about the cleanliness of things(even though that's probably just in my head)!  2) We were greeted promptly and seated promptly.  DING DING DING!  3) Drinks were filled the entire time.   Didn't have to ask once!  4) It's got a pretty cool vibe.  The ambiance is very chill & comfortable & it's in a convenient Central location.   5) Good size bar, stocked with a bazillion beer choices!  I don't do beer but the hubby was excited about this!    6) The food was amazeballs!  What we ordered:  Cauliflower & Broccoli Bake: At first I was all,  I'm good on this,  but let me tell you this was the best broccoli/cauliflower I've ever tasted.  This was still bubbling when the server brought it out covered in cheese and breadcrumbs.  Sooo good.  I almost didn't want my pasty!  Almost...  Bangers & Mash Pasty: Golden brown on the outside,  filled with ridiculous, savory goodness & a red wine gravy... I wish my stomach were bigger!  Veggie \"Chicken\" Pot Pie Pasty: My hubby said the fake chicken was seasoned perfectly.  Usually he's still hungry after veggie meals,  not in this case!  He was stuffed to the gills & happy!  Overall,  we really enjoyed this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Love the food, atmosphere & awesome beer selection!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and decided to bring home pasties, you can finish baking them at home. Wow. The food I brought home was great. The red wine gravy was wonderful. I brought home 4 different flavors.  All great. Will be going back for sure !!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Wonderful food at great prices. My friends and I ordered a variety and shared them (which is the best way to go). The carne adovado pasty was delicious with the right amount of heat. The Greek chicken...so tasty! And the peppered steak with Stilton cheese was hearty. Unfortunately, we were too full to get dessert. I guess we'll have to come back again!"}
{"text":"Really good!   My daughter took us there on our first day in Arizona and it was a great choice.   Service was great. Food was excellent.  The food is very fresh. And they have a great selection at great prices. It's a little dark inside but no impact to enjoying the food."}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty! The beer selection and food quality are second to none. What a unique style of food and laid back atmosphere; what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place in Tempe!! Great food, great beer selection, awesome atmosphere. Highly recommend!! Would give 6 stars if possible"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS GOOD! Haven't had a pasty I've been disappointed with so far! My favorite is the chicken portobello ! Their oven chips and meatballs for appetizers are great as well! The pastys and made and baked fresh, so it can take a little time to get your food, but it is so worth the wait! Great prices on alcohol! And their desserts are SO good!! My fave is the chocolate bread pudding! A MUST everytime we good!      The only con is the staff/service ! Sometimes we get great servers that are very attentive and keep our drinks filled.. Other times it takes forever to see our server and to get the bill to pay!"}
{"text":"I had this place on my radar, so when fellow yelper, Loon E. and his girl were in town and suggested this place, I was all in! Walking inside it seemed dark, but I liked it. We chose a table and menus and waters were quickly brought to us. Loon had a beer I tasted that was supposed to be ginger flavored, but the ginger taste was very faint. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide what to order because it all looks so good.   The menu consists of signature, premium and vegetarian pasties, soups, salads, desserts and an interesting variety of appetizers. To start I ordered \"Oven Chips\" priced at $3.50 plus an additional 50 cents for cheese I wanted on them. The chips are hand cut British style and baked in the oven with cracked pepper and sea salt. I thought the chips were a bit on the soggy side. I wondered if it was because of the addition of cheese that made them soggy, but after tasting the oven chips with jalapeno and no cheese that the others at my table were sharing, they too were mushy and soggy to me.  I ordered a \"Carne Adovada\" pasty priced at $9.50 and WOW! After the first bite, my taste buds were dancing with joy! This pasty has simmered pork in a New Mexican red chili stew, rice, chilies and cheddar. It also comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. There is so much great flavor going on in this pasty! I honestly never even tried the salsa that accompanied it because the pasty itself has such good flavor on it's own, but I did really enjoy it with the sour cream. I must come back and eat this again! I sampled some of the \"Bangers and Mash\" pasty and thought the first bite was okay, but the next was a bit blah. The red wine gravy that came with it was too salty. I have to say that it isn't something I have ever had before, so I truly can't compare it to another, but the flavor wasn't for me.  Our server was just great! I wish I could remember her name to give her a proper shout-out, but I can tell you aside from being an awesome waitress, she knows all about Emoji and how everybody needs a little in their life! ;)  If you wanted they have an option to take a part-baked pasty home to bake when you are ready to eat it. The part-baked pasties are sold at a reduced price, but they make a certain amount fresh throughout the day, so I would recommend calling your order in to make sure they can have the pasty you want ready to take home. I want to come back at some point to try out some of their other sides and try baking a pasty at home to see how it turns out. With the variety of pasties here, if a certain one doesn't work for you flavor-wise, give another one a try! Maybe you will find a favorite like I did!"}
{"text":"Both times I've been to Cornish Pasty I wasn't disappointed. However, I was also never really excited about eating there, nor did I leave feeling like, \"Wow! That was great!\"   Basically, meh?"}
{"text":"Okay, before I get into praising this place as a go-to spot for anyone within a 30 minute driving radius, a couple peculiarities about this place: 1.  The ambiance is dark and pub-like. No getting around that. If that works for you, cool; most parents with little kids, however, will feel out of place, and not because of anything wrong.  I came here with my newborn and 3-year-old after the zoo, it felt awkward but was worth it for the food and beer.  If you come when it's comfortable outside, then you can sit outside and not be in the dark. 2.  It's easier to see this place from Hardy Drive than from University Drive.  Ok now that's out of the way. The British pub ambiance here perfectly matches the food and beer. Great curated beer list, and the pasties are awesome. The bean dip starter had an interesting vinegar flavor, and came with great crackers (they were softer than normal crackers and I'm pretty sure house-made). The bread that came alongside the soup was definitely house-made and had gravitas. It was great! When I ordered my Rosemary chicken pasty, my server recommended a brown ale. It went great with my meal!   The crust was perfectly dense and flaky, and the insides breathed Rosemary while all the chicken and other vegetable flavors supported each other while sitting in a delicious sauce.  My mother in law is a vegetarian, so she ordered the onion and cheese, which I tasted and was FANTASTIC.  Service was really good and friendly throughout, and the food and beer support the time-travel and country-transporting effect that the ambiance offers. Definitely a go-to dining experience, even if you don't drink beer."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place, but was with a friend that last minute got a call from another friend to meet there for dinner. Upon checking out the menu, I was pleasantly surprised at all the vegetarian options available. They even had the quorn brand imitation meat, which in my opinion tastes the best. I really wanted to try the Veggie Rosemary \"Chicken\" pasty, but unfortunately they were out that night. I decided to try the Veggie Spicy Asiago \"Chicken\" pasty, and it was amazing. It had a croissant-like flaky crust, and the flavors blended together perfectly. The staff was friendly and the prices were good. I'm definitely going back to try the Veggie Rosemary \"Chicken\".  Edit: Went back to try the Veggie Rosemary Chicken pasty and it was awesome. My friend was with me from out of town and had the Veggie Greek pasty, and loved it as well."}
{"text":"The food is divine. I wish I worked/lived closer. The are super friendly and fast. The place is a cave, but you don;t notce once you take a bite."}
{"text":"Picked this based on Yelp reviews. Lots of choices of pasties and the two we had were top notch. Would come back if we lived in the area. Coming out of the bright sun the interior was very dark, after a while we got used to it, but still needed our phone lights to read the menu. :( Service was good and the afternoon atmosphere was quiet."}
{"text":"If there were more stars they would get them! Food - awesome beyond words, service was good and fast but we went early. I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and Yelped a few places to try. My friend and I decided to go to Cornish Pasty in Tempe. It was dark and open seating, definitely had a pub vibe inside. We decided to sit outside at the patio to enjoy the Fall weather.   I got the Oggie and my friend got Shepard's pie with a side Oven Chips - added the garlic and jalepenos. I love anything pie crust and these pasties definitely hit the spot.  The minced lamb from the Shepard's pie was  cooked perfectly and not too gamey. The Oggie was a classic and a comfort food. Oven chips were like french fries cooked with minced garlic and jalepenos that weren't spicy at all. I found out there's a location in Vegas and will definitely have to visit there to try the other pasties."}
{"text":"We ran to Lotus of Siam for lunch and got hit with an hour wait. I remembered seeing this place pop up on yelp a few months ago and decided to check it out. It worked out great because it's 50 yards away and we had parked right in front of it.  We weren't sure what to expect but when we opened the door we knew we had found a cool spot. The server was friendly and we grabbed a table right away. We ordered the chips and two pastys.  The chips came out and were excellent. I loved the amount of cracked pepper. Tasty.  Both pastys were super good. I got the traditional and my friend grabbed one of their specialty pastys.  We left full and happy. Enough said."}
{"text":"I almost dont want to review this place, because I like it being my little secret. The food and drinks are great, very cozy atmosphere mixed with comfort food. The people are fun. The food is authentic and the menu is a pretty decent size. My two favorites are the chicken pot pie and Philly steak."}
{"text":"Great location, food and staff. Cornish Pasty delivers the best quality food and service every visit. I love the Italian pasty! Everything from their pastys to dessert have been consistently amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with a cozy vibe. We came here because we wanted to try something different and interesting. Everything comes in kind of a hot pocket style. There is a pasty for everyone here, and lots of vegetarian options. We ordered the chicken pot pie, beef stew, and leek soup. All very good and lots of different beers to pair it with."}
{"text":"Grown up hot pockets! What's not to love?! The restaurant had a cool vibe and atmosphere. The service wasn't bad. They were out of the chilled bean dip we tried to order, though. The pasties were quite tasty - it was our first time trying them, and we were impressed."}
{"text":"The pasty has officially gone down hill in my opinion. The daytime bartender during the day is very nice but slow as molassess. Always waiting for a drink/food/bill.   Tonight annoyed me to the point of not coming back for awhile.  I ordered a salad to-go with dressing on the side. When I got home the salad was smothered in dressing; not a huge deal.  Came back and they replaced it. Once home I opened it to find missing ingredients and a freaking hair. Not cool."}
{"text":"this was just ok. didnt think it was anything special. the gravy and the crust were good though.  it was also hard to find because it is hidden behind the AM PM and you cant really see the restaurant from University since it is technically not on University since it is in a small strip mall."}
{"text":"Salmon Cornish is Devine. Accept nothing less than this delicacy. Also, for non beer drinkers who want in the beer club there is a pink beer that's so good it tastes like a cocktail!!! Ask your server! It's on tap. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm sure not  a lot more can be said that hasn't been already in previous reviews but I just had to add my two cents and say this place is wonderful and I'm glad I got back to the Chandler area on a visit so I could have the fortunate experience of eating here (I learned about it on Yelp in San Diego).  I was introduced to pasties on my trip to Michigan last November and had them a few times there and I will tell  you the one I had here was way better than any I had there!  Perfect crust, perfect mixture inside--I just wish I lived near, or that they would open a branch in San Diego area!  I got the lamb and mint pastie and it had a mild but distinct lamb flavor (sometimes I order lamb dishes that just taste like beef so I appreciated this) mixed with the veggies and mint.  Very Delicious.  I would have loved to try a dessert but I was too full and had no frig in my motel to take leftovers back to. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly, too.  I will definitely add this to my list of must-go places for the next visit!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't the Midwest have one of these?  I wrote corporate an email saying they need to open one in the land of fat people, Illinois."}
{"text":"No - this is not a review of the pasties that women wear to cover up nipples underneath their clothing or instead of bathing suit tops... this is a review for Cornish pasties... and to be honest, I didn't know what they were either, until I read the 133 reviews that came before mine!  So, I finally made my way to Cornish Pasty Company today after months and months of seeing the reviews roll in, and now I know why there are so many CP fans.  This place is great!  It's kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable - and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties, which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients, and many of them sound super yummy; i had a hard time deciding what to order...   I went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  I'm thinking perhaps next visit I'll try a salad - maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?  Either way, I'll be back - it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!"}
{"text":"This is a lively restaurant with quaint wallpaper and vintage photos of miners. Since pasties were invented as a convenient lunch for miners in Cornwall; the menu features a bit of history.  I noticed they have a variety of vegan and vegetarian pasties.   The menu is full with regular pasties and premium pasties in addition to salads. They also have a large drink menu and beer menu. Sides are separate and not included with the entrees.  I ordered The Oggie and Cottage Pie per server's suggestion. The crust of the Pasty was buttery, flaky and delicious. The Cottage Pie was like Shepherd's pie in the pasty dough and was perfectly stuffed with ground beef, mashed potatoes, cheese and veggies. So delicious!  I was glad I finally made it here today. Food took 15 mins to come out, not too bad.  Such reasonable prices and quality food. This is a great spot regardless of the size of your party or your type of outing."}
{"text":"I have had several pasties and they were all good. They have a good beer list with huge mugs available. I like the classic rock that they play, and the dive-bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible! I have been to the other location on Dobson prior and was thrilled when I realized this Cornish was right by my home. I decided my friend and I would meet up here for drinks. On this particular night the resturant was packed, like usual. My friend and I saw two open seats at the bar and sat down. About 10 minutes later the waitress told us she would be with us shortly.   When we hit the 30 minute mark, I was nothing but enraged at the terrible customer service. I told my friend that I wanted to go somewhere else. As I was getting up and gathering my purse, the waitress comes over and had the balls to tell us she was just about to take our order. I informed her that we were leaving because she took 30 minutes to get to us. She should have just let us leave and not say anything. The fact she even acknowledged she was a crappy waitress enraged me more.  So why the three stars? When you're not waiting FOREVER for service and you actually get the opportunity to eat their pasties, your mind will be blown! The food is delicious! The only downside is you don't want to show up at ANY Cornish starving because it takes them a little while to cook them bad boys. I assure you that you won't regret the wait though!"}
{"text":"Best food ever! Order the Royal with Cheese and the Banoffe Pie. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Over an hour wait at lunchtime. I'm glad they're popular but they have to figure something out - people need to get to work.  15 minutes before anyone even came to the table and other 15 to get drinks. And then the food didn't come for a full hour. Food was fine but definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Here's the scoop. I LOVE the Cornish Pasty. LOVE. However, this location severely lacks compared to the one in Mesa off of Guadalupe Rd. The service is not as prompt and observant. We waited 10 minutes at our table before someone came to get our drink order. Once we got our drinks, we told her we needed just a few more minutes before ordering our food, but she didn't come back to take our order for almost another 15-20 minutes. Perhaps it was just out server, so I don't want to assume they are all like that. HOWEVER,  their pastys don't even compare to the other location first and foremost. Their vegan pastys are not as well made either and fall apart every time I have had them from this location. They were also out of mushy peas, didn't offer us more water or beer when we were all clearly out of drinks. Just little things that made it less of an experience than the other location. Like I said, I LOVE cornish pasty and will always continue to go and refer friends, etc. but do yourself the favor and drive the extra 10 minutes to the one on Guadalupe. It is BOMB."}
{"text":"I had eaten here a few years ago when they first opened, but didn't remember too much about it other than cheap Irish Car Bombs.  It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.    I'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.    I could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.  As for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"\"Pasties\" sounded, well, how can I say this delicately? Yucky. Since I ate them I had read up on them a bit and understand that they are a traditional British favorite, made of uncooked meats and vegetables baked into a pie shell. But, I still had my doubts...  I hesitantly ordered the Oggie -- my server told me it was the most traditional -- and my Significant Other chose the Lamb and Mint (?). The restaurant had an upscale \"vibe\" --- entertaining cooks, nice servers, smiling diners, and interesting music on the satellite radio. The prices were very reasonable and the portions HUGE. I can't say I am yet a big fan of pasties, but if you are, this place has a lot going for it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far, but I absolutely loved the pasties my husband and I got.  We will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! Is there anything on this menu that is not delicious? Great service! The manager, Tyler was so helpful and accommodating to my special requests. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Tempe area. A++++"}
{"text":"Finally ate here last night after wanting to forever! Got the shepherd's pie pasty and it was so good. Gravy on the side was a perfect addition. Very filling too. As always, the place was pretty crowded but we were seated quickly and I really liked our server. I would definitely go back- and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Get ready to eat! These Pasties are not light and no you won't just eat half and take the other with you. My vegetarian pasty was so good i ate the whole thing there. I was very impressed that I was able to share this experience with my Vegan friend and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ok. So you've come to Lost Wages for fun. If you intend to eat while you're here, and I know that's optional for some  visitors,  run don't walk to the Cornish Pasty Co. I promised myself I wouldn't give a good review because I hate waiting in line for great food. But it's so damn good I had to. Stop reading. Go. Forget about not knowing what a pasty is. You're gonna love it.  And I won't be able to get a seat."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I love this place and miss it. Super tiny space, super filling delicious pasties. The faux-chicken they use (quorn) is incredible and very realistic. My fav pasty is the balsamic portobello, the dessert pasties are also tasty, granted you have room. Only downside is the size and wait time."}
{"text":"I am writing all the way from San Francisco because of my terriffic cravings for the absolutely most delicious Cornish Pasties anywhere!  First of all, what a great value! Each of these pasties is rightly proportioned for me for two meals. I have a Guinness or sometimes a Stella and I am as full as can be! The other half makes a great surprise for a good friend or lunch tomorrow, and they only cost about ten bucks.  My favorite thing on this menu is the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and this is coming from someone who always hated Shepherd's Pie as a kid! Inside of this delicious golden crust there is seasoned ground beef, browned onions, garlic mashed potatoes and what tastes like tilamook medium cheddar. These guys serve it up with a side of what they call \"red wine gravy\", but it tastes like a borderlaise to me -deep and beefy with plenty of thyme.   If I could eat anything everyday without ever getting fat, this place makes the short list!  *mwah* belissima!  Oh and I really liked the Carne Adovada Pasty with the sour cream on the side too!"}
{"text":"Wow, from the Portland area, but I'll go out of my way to come here any time I come to Phoenix. About 5 minutes from the airport. I had the Guiness stew pasty, it was awesome. Rest of the family had Ruben,   oggie, chicken pot pie and cottage pot pie. Everyone loved them. I tried all and they were all great. Guiness had the most flavor. Ruben had red cabbage."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Good beer and even better food. Their royal with cheese is my favorite! But they're all great. Plus vegetarian options for my daughter! Gotta try it if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Picture this...3 $1 bills (which may or may not be from a bet I lost (or won) at the strip club)...an affinity...a propensity...nay, a proclivity! for Irish Car Bombs and a menu that says 'CAR BOMBS: ALWAYS $3'.  Those 3 words, squiggly symbol and numeral made me squeal and giggle with glee. The music they were playing was also very appeasing.  Monday night, Hubzilla and I were looking for ADVENTURE!, completely exhausted with the usual suspects that we pick up for take out, we headed down to the college town affectionately known as \"Tempe\" and whipped out the handy dandy Yelp App.  Up jumps \"Cornish Pasty Company\" at the top of the list.  Eventually we found it tucked into the back of a strip mall (weirdly unexpected location...but sooooo glad we didn't turn away).    Down to brass tacks:  The menu has a bunch of stuff on it, yummy-sounding stuff, inexpensive stuff...After a brief conference with our server (and a couple of car bombs to lubricate our speaking skills) we decided to split The Oggie and The Peppered Steak.    The Oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it, the flavors just kinda...pop.   The Peppered Steak, by default, was the 2nd favorite, but was also very yummy. I just wish that the peppercorn brandy cream sauce that came with it wasn't cold. Some people really like that, I guess, but I'm a warm-to-room-temperature-or-hotter saucy kinda chick.   Next time, I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu (they have creme anglaise!!!). I REALLY look forward to going back (soon) to try more pasties!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food, Rock n Roll playlist, decent customer service. Basically a cool place to hang out with very tasty grub. Had the Lamb Vingaloo, very spicy so if you don't like spice beware. The only downfall was the parking. I needed to keep fillin the meter, besides that I would recommend this location if ya just wanna hang with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place I was thrilled when I flipped over the menu and found vegetarian and Vegan Pasties! Super delicious flavor for vegan I tried the vindaloo...yum if you are vegetarian the tikka masala is where it is at. My mom had the rosemary Pastie I had a bite and was super in love. The server was super attentive to filling up out waters even though we were just getting take out! Will be back soon on my next cheat night!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service!  Large portions.  Location is a bit of a hole in the wall, but it has it's charm."}
{"text":"We almost always try and seek out new spots to dine on the weekends. Cornish Pasty came up and  so it was decided for lunch. If you dined at Komol, you won't have a hard time locating CPC...its right next door!  Its a little dark as you step inside, two tops along the right side, cool usage of church pews for communal dining on the left, and counter style dining up at the bar. Perusing the menu, it was kinda nippy, so we decided to start with some cups of soup. Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton for Wifey, and Cream of Tomato for me. The Minion in me also spied a Banana Bread Ale, so I ordered one after our waitress said they had a couple left...only to be disappointed because our waitress failed to double check the bottles inside the Banana Bread Beer box...:( Our soups arrive, so we dig in. The homemade bread was delicious, but sadly the soups were so thick and salty, we only got halfway before calling it quits.  The Pastys(Thank Goodness!) were delicious and filling! Wifey's Pilgrim Pasty had all the flavors of Thanksgiving wrapped up in a perfectly crisp pastry casing. Equally good was my Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty-rich, hearty, and just enough spice to go perfectly with the Mint-Yogurt Sauce. The Toffee Pudding and Bread Pudding also sounded great, but we were beyond stuffed! Great reason to look forward to another visit. I will also pass on the soups but hopefully they have a new shipment of Banana Bread Beer too!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Vegetarians and meat eaters alike will be delighted by the innovative menu here I LOVE that they use QUORN vegetarian meat replacement products and not shitty Gardein or Morning Star! Brits will be very happy with the menu options here too obviously i.e. scotch eggs, mushy peas, banoffee just to name a few.  I like the cider they have on tap also delicious cocktail varieties. Only thing I wish they would get is Magners cider on tap then I'd be here way more often! As a veggie I personally recommend the Veggie 'chickn' tikka pasty"}
{"text":"I love eating here! I love getting take out! They are very nice, the hipster thing is fine, you aren't made to feel unwelcome, but the cool people are just sooo cool! :) haha! The Cajun is yummy, bangers and mash, the burger one with thousand island is soooo yummy! Oh, but the tomato soup.... oh my heavenly goodness!!"}
{"text":"Very good pasties. To call them \"fancy hot-pockets\" would not be giving them enough credit. Itty-bitty little space inside, though. Can be hard to get in during busier days/hours. Good stuff."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!! Yelp is the best thing since space travel!!!  I would have never found this place, and it is AMAZING!!!    Note:  it's BEHIND the Mexican food place - I almost drove away - very glad I didn't!    I can't even describe in words how amazing the Shepherds Pie is!!!  The lamb is OFF THE HOOK!!!  Some sort of red wine gravy / sauce...  I could drink it straight!   You know the kind of meal that makes you sigh, relax a bit and remember your grandmothers house?  Yeah - that's this place...  The staff looked like a mix of biker gangs and turned out to be the friendliest people in Phoenix!!!    Got hooked on Crabbies Ginger beer there too!  You'll have a GREAT dinner!!!  Enjoy!  PS: asked about desserts- BOOM!  Some sort of caramel pie with whipped cream and bananas!  Insane!!!  It's like eating diabetes!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is off the beaten trail - not on the Strip and slightly outside of Old Vegas - but Cornish Pasty is well worth the effort to get there.  The physical location looks like a reclaimed auto body shop. They stripped it down to the bricks then built the bar and food prep/cooking area in the center of the building. Seating is in the perimeter. Something I appreciated is that the seating areas have some fixed tables/chairs with generous spacing between the chairs and tables. I've been seated in some booths where I am literally wedged in.  So, what is a \"pasty\"?  They are whatever savory (or sweet) concoction you can cook in a pie crust. Pasties originated from the Cornwall section of England which happens to be where my English ancestors came from. Pasties are the English cousins of calzones and empanadas.  For drinks beforehand, my sister ordered the restaurant's take on an Old Fashioned which used Mezcal. I would come back just for that cocktail - it was that good. I got an apple cider that you would never guess was hard cider. It should carry a warning label. It went down so easily I could easily have quaffed the entire pint without coming up for air. What I appreciated was the pasties take around 15 minutes to bake which means you can relax and enjoy your drink before the food comes.  I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie pasty. My partner ordered the Oggie, apparently the first creation of the chef. My sister ordered the Salmon pasty. We split sides of Cole Slaw. The table went quiet for five minutes as we launched into the pasties. Each was served with a dipping sauce. My pot pie had a rosemary gravy that was divine. My sister could only eat two thirds of the salmon pasty. Unless you want to cart home leftovers, you might want to consider sharing.  Last but not least, dessert. We ordered the Sticky Toffee. OMG!! It is served with vanilla ice cream. It could safely be shared among two or three people. I guarantee you will leave in a with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"great food with vegetarian options. great environment, dive bar feel, lots of locals. kinda dark inside but ambient. outdoor patio. I love it here, also love stopping by the hole in the wall location on Mill Ave for a quick drink and lunch or to post up with my laptop."}
{"text":"Very good I recommend this restaurant good costumer service create food everything in their menu I like it very clean."}
{"text":"It's sad, I love the food but I recently drove across town to pick up my 5 pasty offer and they give me a tofu and a chicken pasty instead of beef and then ignored me when I complained, who does that?  I can tolerate the loud music and lack of parking but not being ripped-off and ignored.  Revised, ok they did respond and are offering to return money for wrong pasties.  That means a lot."}
{"text":"This place is unique, huge and delicious.  The servers are incredibly sweet and attentive. I had the royale with cheese for lunch not just because it sounded delicious, but because of the awesome name that brought a smile to my face.  The dish was a. Ice portion and so very flavorful.  The price is affordable as well. The tough part is the parking, but the experience makes it worth it."}
{"text":"A clear favorite!! Every time I am on this side of town I make it a point to come here. Affordable, absolutely delicious and I order a partly baked to take home for my kids for dinner. They wrote the instructions and dinner is served. My kids love it!"}
{"text":"Very delicious pasty. I had the spicy chicken asiago and my wife had the Pilgrim. The portion was generous and the flavors were all there. The jalapeno and black bean dip is excellent as well. Hannah took great care of us too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Odd experience. Our waitress, who might have also been the manager, seemed extremely flustered. She did not come by the table after serving our food, apologized for the poor service, and then cursed when my friend asked for change. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Excellent:  * They're open late!  * The pasties reheat really well @50% power, which was my primary goal. I bought 4 of them for a couple days of food in my hotel room while in town for work.   The Good * The Pasties: Lamb and Mint, Shepherds pie, italian, and Bangers and Mash. (Bangers and mash and italian were my favorite). I tried all 4 the night I bought them, when they were hot and fresh.  * They were a little dry (particularly the lamb ones), and it would have been nice to have some sauce INSIDE the pasty (maybe that makes them soggy though?) * The red wine sauce was really good, but was a little salty when I added enough to help with the dryness.   The Bad:  * None! Maybe the price is a little high? almost $10 seems a little high... but overall, I was happy.   I will happily go back when stocking up on a few days worth of food."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place just located in the downtown Tempe area. I do appreciate how the lighting is nice and dim that fits with the ambiance of the food and drinks provided. I have never really understood the menu specialties, and it was simply put as a calzone style of meals. With that I went with the meatball pastie, that included fresh sliced meatballs, basil, fresh marinara and mozzarella. This pastie is one of many that they offer depending on your cravings.  Next time I will make an effort to try out the other Pasties and the wonderful flavors to expect !"}
{"text":"Went for great craft beer. Had a great pasty too. Decent service. Clearly popular with the ASU students. Worth stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm just excited that this place will make a Vegan pasty. You gotta call an hour in advance so that he can make the dough..and he leaves off the eggwash (so yours is a bit different looking than the others) but hey, its a different food in a veg-lacking AZ.  Both of our pasties were somewhat oversalted, so 4 stars for that. However, don't let that deter you. Most food in AZ tastes oversalted so maybe its just me.  I'd say 'not good for groups\" (meaning larger than 4) cause the place is kinda small."}
{"text":"Found this place by searching Yelp and was close to the area of a great ice cream shop I frequent. Had the meatball pasty and was so good came back the next day to try the chicken pesto. Highly recommend and cute little spot with multiple levels for seating."}
{"text":"Cool place with awesome outdoor seating. I'm visiting Phoenix and found this place on Yelp. Wow, the food was amazing and the service was really good too."}
{"text":"As a Brit a long way from home, I couldn't believe it when my friend took me to this little gem hidden away in a random Tempe stripmall. The dark grungy decor and Hipster clientele seemed straight out of Capitol Hill in Seattle!   I had the original Cornish pasty, like what pasties are in the UK. Though the pasty menu is extensive and creative with lots of veggie options too.  It was fantastic!  Succulent steak chunks and vegetables wrapped up in the delicious pastry crust. Very authentic!  Also had the mushy peas, true British chippy style.   For dessert I had to have the sticky toffee pudding as that's my all time favourite 'afters' from home. It arrived in its own black cauldron with a side of creme anglaise. Absolutely amazing! The sweet gooey toffee inside was perfectly warm and runny. My friend and I quickly inhaled the whole thing in a few spoonfuls.  Overall it was a great dining experience here. Lots of beer choices too. I shall be back!"}
{"text":"Even things that sound like they won't be good - actually turn out to be great. The food is uncommonly good.   THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS PLACE IS: the waiters have no uniform and they all dress like hipsters. You can't tell who is bringing your drinks and who is just a bassist in an alt-rock band."}
{"text":"I cannot even explain how much I loved this place. Between the food and beer list I couldn't be happier. Had the chicken pot pie and died over it. Definitely not the most comfy seating arrangements but over all really great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great beer! We will be going back for sure and brining our friends!"}
{"text":"Talked a friend into going to Cornish Pasty for dinner on a Friday night, so off we went to the Tempe location.  We arrived around 7ish and the place was packed, guess that's good sign right?  Only seating available was up by the bar, so off we went.  After checking out the menu I knew I wanted to give the Peppered Steak a try, it had sirloin steak sautéed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini & stilton cheese with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce and for a side I ordered some British Chips. The pasty was delish, the flavors blended well together, and the crust was perfectly cooked I was pretty happy with my pasty,,,,,,,  Until I tried a bite of my friends, who ordered the Carne Adovada which was simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies & cheddar and came with a side of sour cream & salsa, Oh My Lawd, that's just a perfect pocket of food! Instantly I had plate envy and no longer wanted mine, which was delish on its own.   Service was great and friendly, sitting at the bar was cool, and where we sat we were able to watch them prepare some more pastys to be cooked"}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious. The ambience is great. We just found a new place to hang out. Great beer and food! A real gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Being British stuck in the middle of the desert I have to say I nearly broke down in tears when I discovered this place. The joy of eating such delicious and American adapted English cuisine makes me very emotional. Satisfying me mentally, physically and culturally.  In a world where people actually rate gross, breaded, stale fish patty's from Pete's fish & chips as legit British food I had given up on life. How could such basic and easy British cuisine be so poorly executed? Maybe it's the desert heat? Even Brit owned restaurants here are poor... until now.  There is no wonder they are spreading across the valley so quick. The parts here are incredible and they have approx 1 billion options. There is only one style of Cornish pasty in England but the owner has adapted a bunch different styles and flavours in order to keep hold the average Americans attention (this can be difficult).  Overall a great experience, even though this place feels a bit like a dungeon I'm really ok with this as the teriyaki pasty gives me life."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I tend to stick to the more basic and traditional style pasties now, as the more unique ones just seem a little odd to me. I can't say I've ever had anything I didn't like though. Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat & spunky restaurant in the Art District downtown.   About the restaurant:  * VERY spacious  * decor is mining themed (considering the type of food they serve & its origin)  * tables are unique - some tables are long won church pew benches  * kitchen is in the middle with clear glass, so you can see how they make the pasty  * ample selection of the pasties  * serving size is quite big   [ CONS ]  * parking is limited (or far). But it's the art district downtown, so it's kind of expected  * the bathroom needs better lighting  * I ordered the shepherd's pie pasty & it was a bit to salty for me   Overall, it was a great experience & I'll definitely be back to try their other pasties!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty horrible and the food was decent but fries were in consistent and our server was all over the place and a little quiet and was horrible at refilling drinks. We had to remind him a few times in what we alerted drinking. But we still are good people and left he a 30% tip and we will try this place again in a few months."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty has such delicious food you'll easily come back for seconds. I've only sat in the bar area where there is a full size shuffleboard table and a couple billiard tables, but it's got an awesome feel.  They've got great craft beer on tap with a friendly staff. I did enjoy that they use Jameson bottles as candle holders letting the wax flow down them for lighting. I'd suggest the bangers and mash pasty as it was killer!  Overall a cool place to get a bite, only thing is the parking lot is really small."}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about this place.  I had to try of course.  L and I had our god-daughters for the day.  So we try to take them to different place to try out.  We found great parking and walked in.  It is seat yourself, but most of the empty tables were dirty.  So we sat at a dirty one waiting for them to clean up.  The staff came pretty quickly to clean off the table and gave us menus.  I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty and a side of roasted potatoes.   The chicken pot pie was very good, but the potatoes were slight under cooked.  The service was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is consistently amazing! The decor, staff and food are great. I always get the chicken pot pie and the sticky pudding which is probably the best dessert I've ever had."}
{"text":"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said, but when you have over 1K reviews and almost 5 stars, you know everyone is onto something. I had a standard pasty and it was so tender, flavorful, and just short of jumping for joy while eating it. The meat tasted like it was slow cooked for hours, the potatoes were soft but not soggy, and very well seasoned. The serving is also huge so if you have a big appetite, this will fill it. No sharing!! So far I've only gotten the pasty down, but I can't wait to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"I think I had hyped this place up for myself. After reading all the reviews and looking through all the yummy photos, I had expected the food to taste extraordinary. I had the chicken tikka masala, which I expected to have more curry sauce but it was dry. The yogurt sauce complemented the pasty since it gave a cool taste to the dish. This pasty is worth a try if you are looking for something interesting.  My fiancee had the Oogie, which tasted dry and had scarce amount of steak chunks. If anything there were more potato chunks than steak chunks. The sauce that came with the Oogie did not taste good and made me want to throw up because it was a wine gravy sauce that tasted like expired sauce. I definitely do not recommend the Oogie.  Warning: The pasty takes about 15 minutes to order, so do not come here hungry and expect to get your pasty right away.   Overall, I do want to come back and give this place another try if I am ever in town."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  I just need to go another 15 times so I can try all the vegetarian pasties.  I should know better than to order a side though, but was told by our server that the broccoli and cauliflower bake was really good.  Didn't care for it.  Wished I would have saved my 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Came on a chilly Sunday (it happens in Phoenix too)!  Has a pub like feel...some outdoor seating available.  Restaurant has downstairs and upstairs as well.  I tried the Guinness Stew and Lamb Vindaloo pastys - both were very delicious, but my favorite was the Guinness Stew.  A Cornish Pasty is a meat pie that you basically eat with your hands.  But there were plenty of vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and it's darkness!!  Favorite pasties:  Vegetarian balsamic mushroom with mozzerella, spinach, and a side of marinara.  Peppered steak, the blue cheese in it makes it!  And for dessert the pb&j with banana!  GREAT BEERS!"}
{"text":"Very unique place!  Loved the theory of remembering a miners lifestyle.  A huge selection of variations of the featured product.  Large portions so leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"This place is heaven!  I had the porky, which was so dang good.  It was fun to sit at the bar and watch them make pasties while I waited for my food.  Truly homemade food that is super fresh.  I'm glad a friend recommended this establishment to me.  I will be back.  There are so many more things on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"The gravy... Is to die for, I could eat a bowl of it! Can't go wrong, close your eyes and point at the menu. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I don't get to the U.K. often enough, so this place is a bit o' for me: just enough $$ spent on keeping the inspector from shutting the place down, the rest of the hard-earned margin goes into the owners' pockets.   I have no idea what this long sliver of a place used to be, but it's become heaven for publovers since - a bar that stretches all the way east to Apache Junction with barstools stretching all the way back to the Flintstones, and teensy little 2fer tablet-tables squeezed into the longwall across.   Seemingly dozens of line cooks doubling as servers, seemingly dozens of taps serving wonderful fermented grains, and the meat, fish and veggie pies - my island ancestors never had it so good!"}
{"text":"I came here because it was highly recommended by a friend, this did not disappoint! I wasn't really sure what a pasty was until I looked at pictures and read about it. It's similar to an empanadas and you can choose your choice of filling and it's baked inside! When we first came to this location we were a bit confused on the location, it's actually off to the side of this plaza and it's pretty dark inside, so you always have this pub/bar feel to this place. Service was a bit slow due to only having one server working but who really eats at 2pm, right? Well I guess we do!   I got the chicken pesto pasty and let me just say I was amazed by how good it was. I was able to taste the pesto, the chicken was moist and it was incredibly cheesy inside! What a great combo right!? I loved every morsel of this, I was actually kind of sad when I finished because I wanted another one but was too full to eat another.  My bf got the roast beef pasty and he loved it as well, it had a nice peppery flavor to the beef and the cheese went so well with it. Meat and cheese are two awesome combos!   In the future, when I'm back in Phoenix I'll definitely be back here for more tasty pasty!   Total for 2: $35"}
{"text":"Really great food all the times I've been. Servers are never super outgoing and friendly but who cares, they are busy doing a million things and it's pretty much always busy. Don't get me wrong, the service is always good, and my beer never stays empty for more than a minute or two, if that.  It's got real character, a dark little hole in the wall place. Most of the time I sit at the bar, and the cooks make up for what the servers may lack in conversation or banter. I like that the cooks have a tip box too, that way I can hook it up if the food or cooks go above and beyond which is most every time. I'm scared to go to the other Cornish pasty because I'm afraid it won't compare... It looks a little too clean and contemporary and in my experience the original is always the best. Not a ton of people know about it, so it's great to take first timers there. The menu is vast, unique, and offers plenty for every taste. Every time I've taken a newbie there they have always, always, always been a big fan. Keep it up fellas, your doing great."}
{"text":"The food at Cornish Pasty is unique, freshly made, and delicious! For the vegetarians, I highly recommend The Greek ($8.50) and the Balsalmic Portobello ($9) - both are flaky, delicious and oh so flavorful! My mates enjoy the more traditional meat and gravy pasties and rave about The Oggie (steak + potatoes) and The Royale with Cheese so there's something for everyone and you really can't go wrong!  Service Very attentive and friendly. Relaxed yet polite servers. The waiter kept a close eye on our beverages and offered refills on our water. I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip.   Physical space Beware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art. Some inscriptions may have been written by Lady Gaga during her carnivorous costume days or a confused co-ed (e.g., \"I am meat\"). In any event, once you find the hidden restaurant delicious pasties and friendly service are just a few steps away!"}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed as others......the Reuben Pasty was terrible!  The meat was dry and hard and lacked flavor.  I will give them credit for the tasty crust.  I was looking for a Michigan type of Pastie.....but didn't even come close.  People were nice and place was clean....they do have a huge menu, but nothing this Michigander liked."}
{"text":"I called about 20 different restaurants in Downtown PHX to find a space where I could host my husband's 40th bday dinner and about 30 guests. Most downtown restaurants require a $150-200 fee just to reserve a private or semi-private dining area, and any party larger than 20 people would require a prix fixe menu and/or a a buffet style at a per person cost billed to the hostess. I didn't want to charge my guests, and I couldn't afford to pay for all of them myself. I also didn't want to limit what they could order with a prix fixe menu. When I called Cornish Pasty on Monroe, they happily worked with me and didn't seem phased by this at all. (I even visited the party and called again in advance to make sure there wasn't a catch!) They even allowed my guests to order and pay for  their own food on separate tabs, which I can understand is probably a nightmare scenario for a restaurant. The tables they reserved for us were in a semi-private area up in the second floor loft where all the pool tables and dartboards were. So, it was a lot of fun for our guests. The server was superb - as responsive, quick and accommodating as you could expect for that many people. He even worked to secure us an extra table during dinner rush hour when it became clear that 5 people to a bench was not a realistic estimate. Everyone said their pasties were on-point and a perfect start to my husband's 40th birthday pub crawl downtown. Well done, Cornish Pasty! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible and portions were great. Friendly service and knowledgeable staff. Decent beer selection.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yum!  Despite enduring the inevitable pasty v. pastee conversations (with my own party as well as the one that sat next to us), I have nothing but kind words for Cornish Pasty Co.    My Pepper Steak Pasty was delicious with Stilton blue cheese, zucchini, leeks, and big chunks of steak.  All of my favorite flavors in a nice, cute little package!  Boddington's on tap!   Please, tell me, when are you coming to San Francisco?"}
{"text":"CPC is a fantastic niche restaurant that will put your grandma's pot pies to shame.  I've ordered the majority of their pasty menu over the years and haven't gotten something I didn't like...  The only drawback is the time it takes to prepare the food.  Busy or not, if you didn't call your order in, you'll wait 20-30 minutes for your food.  This place is both meat-eater and vegetarian friendly, so it's a safe place to bring your group of hipster friends who disagree about diets.  Pricing is more than fair at about $10 per pasty."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but the place is great. Food is hot from the oven and the toffee dessert is to die for!!"}
{"text":"The food here is to die for...  I'd highly recommend the pilgrim. It is a Thanksgiving party in your mouth... I love leftovers over the regular Thanksgiving meal and this pasty puts those leftovers to shame. The other meals we've had there have also been freaking amazing. Mix in some craft beer and it's a perfect night out.   The only negative thing I can say is that both times I've gone they've been rather busy... But busy is good so just make a reservation or go off of peak hours."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. To say I really enjoyed the food is an understatement. I didn't know what to expect.... but it definitely blew me out of the water. There's a lot to choose from on the menu & they even have veggie/vegan options!! **Do not skip dessert** I would recommend the apple pie. Great atmosphere & service. Really glad my cousin suggested this place. I shall be back every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Well. No doubt that the food is great. Service is just so-so.   They need to check back especially when waiting for your check  / work together as a team. It works for sure!   The down side is a party of four waited over a hour to sit. They asked the waiter with the beard. To merge. Two tables together. They were seniors. And he said they could not do that. (The tables that are on the right side when you walk in).  I felt so bad for them  they were complaining about it. It was a very easy fix. To keep guests happy and returning back. And. Also word of mouth goes way far!!!  So please accommodate the guests in any way you can. It's not a big deal     Also turn and burn. The tables. Makes $$$$.  For all!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try some of their soup after seeing another patron with some last time and I'm glad I finally did - despite it being nearly 110 degrees outside. Served with bread & butter to sop it up with, their Cream of Leek, Potato, & Stilton soup is A+!"}
{"text":"I first went to the Cornish Pasty Co in Tempe in December. I was addicted immediately. Amazing vegetarian pastys, craft beer - what else do you need? Following a plan for a family Vegas weekend in February, I found out that they opened a location in Vegas. It was a MUST do for the weekend. On Saturday I brought my family there. There was 8 of us, and we should have called to make a reservation because they were super busy! But they found a space for us. Unfortunately for being pretty new and very busy, there were some hiccups. But for me - I'm in the restaurant industry so I get it. They were out of a lot of the pastys on the menu. They ran out of glasses so it took a whole to get our drinks. My dad's pasty took a while longer than everyone else's to come out. Etc. Our waitress was super sweet though (I think her name is Mandy?) and apologetic about everything. Food was obviously AMAZING (we all agreed!). Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian pasties are very good, even non-vegetarians choose to order them. I like the mexican one the best but I've heard the chicken pot pie, cheeseburger and asiago chicken are great. There is a great beer list and I always get Irish car bombs when I go. And the guys who work here are sexy. It's usually busy but you can order a drink while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and felt like walking into a british pub but with groovy open windows open to the sun. I had a Cubano Cornish pastie. It was divine. Also got a scotch egg .. also good. The service was a little slow but the seats were comfy. Delighted to find a place that's focused on this little known delicious element of british food and yup I'm british avd these pasties are the real deal."}
{"text":"I have visited this place only once. From outside, I was not able to guess since the windows were blacked. This restaurant is long and narrow. Tables are cramped, but that does not dilute the experience.  Food is good, love it. Their food also contains Tikka Masala variants (this taste is still debated whether it originated in England or Indian subcontinent). My overall experience was great. Looking forward to visit it again."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the atmosphere or cleanliness of the place but great pub food....delicious fresh lemonade a.d we split 4 different pastys and all were delicious....shepards pie, chicken pot pie, the traditional , and bangers n mash....all with a delicious red wine sauce or chicken gravy.  Save room for dessert...chocolate bread and butter pudding with ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since 2013. They have a very nice set both inside and outside . They have same dishes since 2013. But the quality of their food is excellent.  I again visited them in Sep 2017 since I was travelling back to  Phoenix. Again same awesome experience in service and food quality. I really miss my days in Phoenix when I used to be regular at their place . I have been to both Tempe and Scottsdale location and both are equally good."}
{"text":"The ratings are accurate - this is a 5 STAR place!  I had gone to Tempe to check out a graduate program at ASU and decided to give this place a shot. I started off with an Old Speckled Hen draft (great beer selection by the way) and a Greek salad. After much deliberation on what pastry to order, I finally settled on the Peppered Steak. The flavors of the pastry were rich and the side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce was extra tasty. It was a slam dunk meal!   The service was good and the atmosphere was very friendly. It's a great place to go with a group or take a date.   *Just a note - I went to the location on University that is tucked away in the back of a small strip mall. It is dark and does not have a lot of signage so it could be a little difficult for first timers to find even with a GPS."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was blown away by the sheer number of choices! Everything sounded good and it was hard to nail it down to just one. I really wish I would've came with hubby so we could have each selected different ones and split them. I finally decided on the Cottage Pie. Seasoned ground beef with mashed potatoes, peas, and carrots all wrapped up in a buttery crust. The filling was spot on with the ratios. It came with a red wine gravy that was excellent. It was very filling and I can't believe that I was able to eat the entire thing. They had several different side options that you could purchase and many of them sounded good however I chose not to get any because the prices seemed a little high for one person. I really liked how the restaurant has three different levels that you can choose to dine in as well as an outside patio. They had a wide assortment of beers and cocktails but because it was my lunch hour from work I stuck with an iced tea.  Too bad because honestly the iced tea tasted kind of off."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we eat here. We always get 2 orders of the tandoori wings so we're not fighting over who had more, lol. The pasties are always cooked perfectly. The pasties are pre made, so no customization."}
{"text":"went here on a double date over the weekend  i have been here many times and love it  the rest of the group it was their first time. they all loved it  all of us will be back in a few weeks  good food and always ice cold beer i will be back many times"}
{"text":"I was excited to try their vegan pasty & went during First Friday, expected there to be a wait, but there wasn't! The menu is limited on vegan options, so I ordered the curry bean dip w/ veggie sticks, the vegan 'philly cheesestake' (the only other vegan pasty option available that night was the southwestern) & a pasta salad no cheese or pesto.   The curry bean dip tasted like spicy curry, but it lacked real flavor. It needed something else, maybe salt? The philly cheesestake was excellent!! It was made with the most well prepared mushrooms & the rue was perfect. The pasta salad even without dressing was really tasty & was a very large portion.   I gave it 4 stars because the dip & i wish I'd had more options to choose from. I'm going back for sure though!"}
{"text":"This was my first ever pasty so it's not fair to judge the food without comparing it to other pasties.  Reason for the 1 star is due to service and flies. The waitress said to seat ourselves at any of the area on the left side of the restaurant and made us change to a table after we chose one of the longer booths (3 guest total)... understandable even though there were only 2 other parties  there.  The entire time there were several flies at our table and another patron booth. Waitress just fans the flies off with the menu at our table and the other booth. Never offered to refill our drinks. She brought 3 separate checks and we all paid in cash and had tip money down on the table as well (she saw this). We all should have gotten change back. She only decided to bring back 2 of our change. It wasn't worth waiting to ask her about it, figured she was just adding it to her tip. I wouldn't go back to this location. Sorry. I think if we had another individual with a more welcoming personality, it would have changed our experience."}
{"text":"Had a British friend give us a couple of these to try a couple of months ago (via take out) and even heated up at home they had us with that delicious crust. The \"Oggie\" and the Italian were loaded with lots of meats and each had it's own sauce to go with. Decided to try the place for lunch on Friday and the wait was a bit long, especially considering we were the first ones in the door at 11am. It got crowded really fast and ended up waiting over 20 minutes for our Bannoffee Pie dessert (which was SO, SO sweet but very tasty, taken in small bitefuls). Either way, the Rueben Pasty was very good but I wouldn't order the chicken pesto one again. Too heavy on the mushrooms and artichokes, not enough meat. And something about these pasties beckons for MEAT! My husband and I are both Cornish Pasty Fans."}
{"text":"Reminds me of my Grandma. They are great. Partially Baked. Take them home. Cheap and easy dinner for the family. Good homestyle meals."}
{"text":"Lot's of really great beers on tap. Awesome atmosphere, staffed by really cool people and not overpriced. The food is extremely delicious, yet simple. There are a wide variety of pasty's for everyone's taste buds, including vegetarian minded people like me. I highly recommend this place for a drink, dinner or taking a date! It's definitely a good mix up to the usual fare, but be forewarned the pasty's are quite fattening--as is the case with nearly everything that tastes good!"}
{"text":"Never really eaten at a place like this, but it was actually very good. Environment was really lively and loud. Went here on the weekend so it was very busy. Very small place so with a lot of people there isn't much room to move around. Also there is only two bathrooms, so there was a little bit of a line to use it. Prices were fair for the amount of food you get. Overall a fun place to hang out and eat."}
{"text":"i like this place. It's informal, inexpensive and it's kind of fun.  You have to applaud how efficiently it's run and where else can you eat a pasty? Some are great and some aren't but it's a good place to stop for lunch.  $10 and you're golden."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Cornish Pasty Co. for years now.  I love the atmosphere of this little place, it is small and cozy. The service is good... i have never had a bad experience with the service and had a couple of really good ones. I actually wrote a poem about one of the waitresses but I'm not going to go into that.   Now with that out of the way I can talk about the food. I love these little Pasties! My personal favorite is the Pilgrim... but the Chicken Rosemary, Stake Rosemary and Cajan are wonderful too, not to mention the Bangers & Mash, and Shepard's Pie.   After all this... one of my families favorite this to do is just order a half dozen pasties to go and bring them home and just smorgasbord!"}
{"text":"Okay, firstly I would like to say that this restaurant used to be one of my favorite places in town and after my last experience here I will most likely never be returning. I will elaborate on why this experience was so horrible. It was on a rainy day about a month ago from today and I can remember everything distinctly.   I wanted to show a couple friends one of my favorite spots in town so I decided to bring them to try a pasty for the first time. We were all in great moods hanging out laughing and having fun. When we sat down we were greeted by our waitress she seemed like she was annoyed by us which is strange because we are all polite and kind and not being rude to her at all. She told us to give her a sec and she would come by to take our drink order. 10 minutes go by(this is fine the first time because we are enjoying eachothers company and in no hurry)... she comes over and takes our drink order... LITERALLY OVER 15 MINUTES GO BY and she returns. I order some apps for the table and I let her know we would be having someone else join our party and we were waiting for them to show up. Our wings come up. She drops them on the table and they hit the wood loudly and the plate spins around. She walks off quickly. She leaves us with an order of wings with no napkins, no plates to eat over, or dishes to put the bones in. We found out our friend would not be joining us right before the wings dropped so we were all just going to place our order but since she ran away so quick we couldn't order. She eventually comes over probably because it was getting to that point in time where we could just possibly walk out from lack of service and we decide to just go ahead and place our order... as for the food it was all good. It's always good. But the service is enough for me to never return to this establishment especially because I used to be a waiter and I always take care of people, leave good tips and I'm always polite and kind. The funny thing is if she was busy none of this would have mattered and I still would've left her a great tip  but we were literally the only table in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for a holiday event not knowing what to expect. I've never heard of this place nor did I know what a Cornish pasty was.  We knew the event included an open bar, food, live music, and appetizers which all lead up to a good night out. There was a private area sectioned off for the event. I didn't get to experience it as a normal customer walking in. However, we had such a great time at the event, we completely plan on coming back for another night out!   Initially, upon entering, I felt that I was walking into an upscale punk rock pub. I loved the vibe - dark walls with modern décor, live band area, clean space, friendly bartenders/waitstaff, multiple types of seating with long tables and billiards by the bar. There was live music and the band was freaking awesome - played covers to a lot of 90s rock/grunge music. The appetizers included a variety of sliced deli meats, sliced apples, and a variety of cheese. The open bar was just that. I enjoyed two mandarine flavored vodka and soda - the bartending staff served it with a smile, and I didn't wait long for a drink at all. The overall service at the event was great - everyone we encountered was kind, helpful, and attentive. The also had a serve yourself water station at the bar which was nice in between drinks (no one wants to be THAT drunk person acting a fool with social media evidence to haunt forevermore). The pasty buffet that was set up to serve yourself. It included a variety of pasties such as Vegan Pasties, Oggie Pasties, Chicken Tikka Masala Pasties, and Carne Adovada Pasties.     Now, this was my first encounter with a Cornish pasty. What struck me was how incredibly similar Cornish pasties are to Latin empanadas. The biggest difference is the stuffing (it would be a stretch to say you're going to find a rutabaga in an empanada). The Cornish pasty crust is also more buttery and flakier than an empanada. However, both dishes have half moon shape with a similar braid along the edge/seal.  My husband and I sampled 'The Oggie' which had a steak, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga mixture--think super comfort food. We also sampled ' The Carne Adovada' which was a spicy mixture of pork red chili stew, Mexican style rice, hatch chili, and cheddar cheese. That was my favorite since it kicked it up a notch in the spice department.   I checked the normal menu out, and the food is very reasonably priced. You're looking at $10 - 12 per pasty. The pasties themselves are generously portioned. You won't walk away hungry. However, you could always add a side or dessert to fill er' up. This is a perfect place to come with a group of friends to enjoy a chic pub atmosphere, drinks, some music, and Cornish pasty comfort food. The music at the event was loud - it was hard to have a conversation. However, the bad was so good that it didn't bother me one bit.    Photos: The event was dark and loud - so please excuse the poorly lit photos/videos. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my boyfriend today. YUMMMMMM! They have 2 vegan pasty options each day and some other vegan friendly sides. I tried the vegan southwest pasty, the baked beans with jalapeños, and the chips. OMGGGGG! Seriously so delicious. Everything was so fresh and so flavorful. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had been bugging my husband about coming to this place for months, when he finally agreed to the idea.  We had eaten pasties in England before and he was not a fan, so he didn't know what to expect.  This place totally changed his opinions about pasties.  The beer selection was pretty good, but my husband ordered beer in a bottle that the menu stated cost $6.50.  When the check came, it cost $10.  The menu should probably be updated to reflect current pricing.    We ordered an Italian and a BBQ chicken pasty.  The expeditor brought out our pasties and we just started eating.  We realized that one of the pasties he brought out was not what we ordered.  It turns out he gave us the wrong order.  They all look the same on the outside, so how were we to know?  He apologized and they gave us the one we actually ordered to -go for free, which I thought was a really nice gesture.   It was also really cool to be able to watch them make the pasties right in front of us while sitting at one of the bars."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Arizona.  I've thought about it often since we visited in December.  Great vegetarian options.  Great beer options.  If you're in Arizona, SERIOUSLY, put this place at the top of your list!  Of all the places AZ friends recommended us, this was for sure the very best.  Yuuuuuuuum."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is delicious! They recently expanded the floorplan to accommodate  larger groups, and now have an outdoor patio for cooler nights. The food is simple but delicious, filing but not super greasy. I love the classic pasty just since the rutabega is prepared with just a tiny hint of crunch left,  just the way I like it. And the dipping sauce is awesome. I wish they would bottle that stuff and sell it. Only downsides are the really, squinty dark interior at night, and the wobbly recycled pew benches. Staple those shits down, guys! Otherwise, a super awesome place with kickass food."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie- was kinda garlicky, like raw garlicky, awesome chunks of white meat. Comforting  Chicken tikka masala- holy cow. White folk made this? High five! You nailed it! Think chicken tikka masala samosa!"}
{"text":"I previously had a great meal and great service here but on Saturday that was not the case.  We ordered and waited about 30 minutes for our food. Waiter was no where to be seen. Dinner arrives and we both had the same bitter burned taste in our meals even though we ordered different meals. It was not in every bite, just some ingredient made it taste terrible. The waiter was not around at all so we had noone to tell. I had to go up to the bar to pay the bill because there were no servers walking about. I won't be returning. Terrible service and something in our food made it inedible."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is fantastic, service is very friendly, and it's reasonably priced. The red wine gravy is to die for!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot in Tempe! Such a surprising treat from such a hole-in-the-wall type spot. The beer selection is quite nice and their pasty's (pronounced Pass-Tee) are perfectly prepared. I've had everything on the menu, but keep finding myself ordering the Pilgrim over and over again. Definitely finish it off with the banoffee pie for the overall experience.  They also have a vegetarian version of nearly all their pasty's which is quite nice."}
{"text":"Quality food but not my kind of thing.  Music was too loud with few customers there during lunch time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants on earth!  Any time I'm in Phoenix I never miss an opportunity to come here. Awesome beer selection, and the food is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  It will leave you stuffed too - the dang thing is huge...  we had the oggie and mint lamb.  Favorite was the cubana."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great here.  The bartender Mikey is hella cool, too - from Hawaii.  Great customer service!  I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Here, i've shared my birthdays, hangovers, dates, heartbreaks, general celebration and merriment. I've showed up in jeans, sari, PJs, mini-skirt; and its always great fun. Ive tried most things on their menu, but tandoori wings are to die for!   The service is sometimes not the best, if you are in a large group. So be patient and talk to your server. Also, it can get loud, because everyone is trying to talk on top of the music. You might want to sit outside if that bothers you.   Make sure you visit the restrooms. They are great fun!"}
{"text":"If you are not familiar with a pasty, it's a savory pocket pie that was originally made to be a portable meal for miners in England. Cornish Pasty Co is one of my favorite haunts. It's hot pockets for foodies. Great food, prepared with fresh ingredients. Everything is made from scratch, from the delicate crust to the savory fillings. They have a huge selection of different fillings (about 35), including a big selection of vegetarian selections. One of my favorites is the Veggie Rosemary Chicken (or non veggie version too). The sides (oven roasted potatoes) and salads are great too. They're open late, so I often stop here after a band gig when I'm starving and sit at the long bar. Service is usually very good."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co. is a little hard to spot when you get to the plaza.  I was thinking it was near Lotus of Siam so when I walked by LoS and didn't see it.   I was a little confused to where it was.  That was until I looked around and noticed it was across the huge parking lot from me.  Ugh!!   Everything was good when I got inside though.  Anyways, on to the Pasties.  When I saw pics of them on yelp, I had a general idea how big they were.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of ordering two pasties and getting super stuffed.  I didn't anticipate how dense one of the pasties would be.  I went ahead and ordered the Royale with Cheese since it seemed pretty popular and to balance it out with a veggie option, I went with the Balsamic Portabello.  Royale with Cheese --  http://bit.ly/1ngvJrW Hamburger, (medium or well) French fries, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, cheddar Swiss blend, Side of ranch, 1000 island, ketchup, or BBQ sauce. The Royale with Cheese was good, but I'm not sure if it's something I'd order again.  It was way too dry for me.  The fries and puff pastry combined made this pasty a little hard to swallow even after spreading the special sauce around it.  The beef hamburger inside was pretty good though.  Balsamic Portabello --  http://bit.ly/1ngvu07 Balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and fresh basil. With a side of marinara. I'd say that my favorite between the two Pasties I ordered was definitely the Balsamic Portabello.  It was pretty much like eating a calzone.  You just gotta love gooey mozzarella and mushrooms.  The pastry on this one wasn't as dense as the Pastry on the Royale with Cheese.  Overall, I was pretty impressed with their Pasties and liked how many different types of Pasties they made over there.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd probably visit them quite often to try all of them."}
{"text":"What a neat place. We were bar hopping, so we stopped in for a beer. Great many on tap as well as in bottles. There are 3 parts to this place, the bar downstairs, where you can watch them make Pasties, the upstairs bar, where there is also darts and pool and the basement which doubles as a speak easy.  We sat watching them make the Pasties (a folded pastry case with a savoury filling, typically of seasoned meat and vegetables) and I vowed to come back later during the week. Get the chance right before leaving for the airport and ordered the Pasty we watched them make. Wow, so delish! I ordered the meatball with buffalo mozzarella and basil. Yummy. Their potato, leek and stilton soup is also delish.  Great place for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Cornish Pasty and I will definitely be back! I loved everything! Their beer selection, specialty cocktails and food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Not one to often give a review. But this place is a wonderful date destination! Nice and artsy, great music, and outstandingly reasonable prices. 5/5 so glad my friends took me here a few months back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. It was pretty packed and turned out to be a long lunch. Took quite a while after ordering to get the food. Our server said they make everything from scratch, so maybe that's why.  I had an ice tea, which is fresh brewed, and it was pretty tasty. Our glasses went empty a few times, but our server refilled 3x.  I ordered the rosemary steak and a friend ordered the rosemary chicken so we could try each. I preferred the steak, but both were really good. it comes with a side of mustard sauce, which really added to the flavor. it was a ton of food, and definitely could have been 2 meals.  i look forward to going back and trying something new. there were a lot of things on the menu that looked really good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Try the chicken asiago or chicken pot pie pastry. Go hungry very very filling and flavorful! Fresh/friendly/delicious  Great beer selection too"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! If you have never been here then you are missing out. We absolutely loved the food. Of course it is not a light meal, but hey what do you expect by the pictures you see. We also had their dessert and it was fabulous. The restaurant definitely has some interesting group style seating but it is definitely unique. I am sure we will be back here again before we leave the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Definitely save room for dessert and get the banofee. My favorite dessert ever!!!  Service was incredible. Garret did a fantastic job. Patient with all our questions and brought us everything we needed and was super friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  Would be a great place to come back in the evening and hangout.  Had the Cottage Pastey and it was fantastic!  Well worth the trip downtown to eat here."}
{"text":"The restaurant will take you by surprise the second you walk in. Expect a dark modern bar setting. Located in the run down Commercial Center, you wouldn't expect such a nice interior.  Menu is pretty simple.  Their specialty? Pasties!  What are pasties? Pasties are fairly large pastries that are filled with meat and vegetables. You should expect an over glorified hot pocket. Their portions are generous! Don't let the size fool you, half will probably fill you up. Sister re-heated my leftovers and had it the next day.   I got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Massala Pasty which was good but not great. The flavors were there but the texture of the veggie chicken was odd. It might just be the kind that they chose to use. I will try a meat pasty next time.  Ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding served with ice cream for dessert just for the sake of ordering dessert. We were so full from the pasties that it was hard to enjoy this.   The service is great, we sat at the bar and got to see them put together the pasties as we ate them, which was comforting...you usually don't get to see what a restaurant does with your food.  Meal for about 3 ran us about $45. Good deal.  I'll be back to try the banana bread beer that everyone is going on about soon."}
{"text":"This was a unique dining experience.  The setting was subdued Irish pub. Dark polished wood, dim lighting, candlelight, and a variety of tables made this place inviting. The service was top-notch with the servers being knowledgeable of their items and making excellent suggestions.  The food. I had the Meat and Cheese Pasty. Homemade pork and sage sausage, swiss and cheddar cheese, in a wonderful pasty crust. It was so tasty. I also had some rich garlic mashed potatoes with cheese. It was a lot of food with half coming home with me. Saving room for dessert, I had the Apple Caramel Pasty. Melt in your mouth heaven. Cinnamon, apples, and caramel all melt in your mouth in a fluffy pasty crust. A delicious meal."}
{"text":"Now this here was a good recommendation and a pleasant surprise.  This location is literally a hole in the wall (or a small hallway through a wall).  You have a tiny path to walk between tables squished up against the wall and the bar.  Behind the bar is where the employees are cramped between the ovens and the cooking area/bar making stuff up for the customers and tripping over one another trying to maneuver around in that tiny space.  Now...don't be distressed.  It was actually a good experience.  I stopped in after work by myself, pulled up a seat at the bar.  A nice young lady from behind the bar came up to take my order.  I had never been here before, so had some questions.  Also, not being a huge onion fan (at least if they are really strong) I asked about the Porky, which aside from onion in the ingredient list, looked quite good.  She assured me the taste was mild and I would not notice.  I took her at her word and she was correct.  I did not notice and enjoyed my porky.  I got it along with a hard cider and garlic roasted \"chips\" (fries).    All in all...I was impressed by the good service, very knowledgeable staff, and in general, good food.  I think I might enjoy some of the other pasties(sp?) a bit more...but the Porky was good and quite flavorful.  The fries...the garlic they baked them with didn't really stick...so it was hit and miss...but overall...still good.  My only complaint really was by the time I got a beer, meal, and fries, it was nearly $20.  $7+ for the entree, $5 for the cider, and ~$3 for the fries.  Somewhat pricey.  But otherwise, good.  Top-notch service."}
{"text":"I love this place.. there wings are so good and they always know wat sauce that blends.. if u love hot pockets and those stuff... must try this place... u won't regret it... they also have a bar that u can chill and have a drink and enjoy the company of friends..."}
{"text":"The walnut, mushroom and spinach soup was awesome. I also had the vegetarian pasty. I brought back half to my boyfriend and he was amazed that it wasn't meat because it had so much flavor.   We had decent service. (Although it would be nice to have the server identify the cheeses on the cheeseboard.   Great sour beer on draft as well."}
{"text":"Every single time Ive been here whether with my family (kids and all) or with friends, this is the best in town for great food or great drinks or both. They have pool and shuffle as well."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and some good pies! what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I finally made it here after being hounded by a friend to go! What a fun, unique place that gives off cool vibe while also being low-key. They have a church pews for seating, a large bar, great music, and artwork to pay tribute to the Cornish miners.   I never had a pasty until I came here. They're similar to what most know as a calzone or hot pocket, except MUCH MUCH better. They aren't stuffed with pizza toppings, but rather, complete meals such as hamburger and fries or steak and cheese! Cornish offers a variety of options. Of them are hearty dishes and vegetarian dishes. A specific number of pasties are pre-made each day so be aware that the one you may want might not be available.  And to that note, whatever ingredients are in the pasty are there to stay. Also bc they are pre-made you are unable to remove items from the pasty. I assure you though, they have a large selection to choose from so keep an open mind!  I had the Peppered Steak which comes filled with steak, mushrooms, leeks, zucchini, and blue cheese. Umm and they serve it with a peppercorn, brandy cream sauce! The pasty shell itself is flaky, has a very light hint of sweetness, and holds it's shape very well. One pasty is more than enough for one person. I had to cut mine in half and saved the other half for dinner the next day. To top it off, I also ordered a side dish. The Broccoli and Cauliflower Cheese Bake. Just order it. It's cheesy and crispy and it has vegetables! Pretty legit combo.   Notes:  -The location is off the beaten path in a plaza where there are also other hidden restaurant gems. The area isn't very great, but there is a lot of traffic from others also seeking new food to eat.  -The service is solid. Drinks on time. Good suggestions are given. Food comes out fairly quick.  -The food is not only delicious, but it's an experience! This is a great place to bring several people with and share pasties. I did this on my second trip and was able to try 3 other pasties in one sitting.   BTW it's pronounce \"pas-t?\" or \"pass-tee.\" There's my bit and I hope you give it a try at least one time!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The ambience is unique. The service is...friendly.  Literally for a year or two, I had a friend telling me to come to Cornish Pasty Company. He made it a point to visit this place every time he came into town, and he felt strongly that I should do the same. Now that I'm actually living in town, I made this happen. And I must say, I'm sad it took me this long to get there, because I've been missing out!  First off, a pasty is a wonderful, flaky pocket of deliciousness. It's like the best pot pie crust wrapped completely around a variety of different combinations. The crust alone is fantastic, and when you put those fillings in it, I couldn't get enough.  When I walked into this place, I kind of wondered where I had gotten myself. The Tempe location is nearly pitch black inside. On a positive note, it's a nice place to go in the middle of the hot summer here, because it was nice and cool inside. There's also a nice porch to eat outside if the weather permits. Seating is on a \"help yourself\" basis, and I think this may lend itself towards the servers not necessarily noticing you immediately. That's what happened to us, both at the beginning and the end of our meal.  I had the Pilgrim pasty, which is essentially a Thanksgiving meal all wrapped inside a pastyl. It has turkey, grilled onions, sweet potatoes, chicken, and stuffing, and is served with a red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. I'm a sucker for cranberry sauce and for Thanksgiving in general, and this totally hit the spot! Normally I'd have been in a bit of a spot trying to decide among the various delicious-sounding options, but when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. One of my friends had the Meat and Cheese pasty, and it was solid as well.  I just looked at the menu again as I was writing this, and my mouth is watering now. There are so many other great selections, and I'm eager to get back and try more.  In summary, great food and unique atmosphere, but don't be in a rush, because the service isn't all that speedy."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Cornish Pasty on numerous occasions and have always had exceptional service and food. I drive from Mesa to this location for a reason. Recommended."}
{"text":"If you truly want an experience sit at the bar and watch as the team puts large batches together and executes the process of each Pasty. It is Comfort food at its finest. Tons of vegetarian options, and creative concoctions. A huge variety of beer. One of a kind service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! I was surprised at how many different types of pastys they offered, I got the pesto chicken and it was delicious! The crust was perfect, and the filling was generous. My daughter got the rosemary steak pasty and she loved it! The staff was very friendly and attentive. They also have a very big selection of beers...I will definitely be back to the Cornish Pasty Co!"}
{"text":"First visit to this place today, and we were not disappointed. Very comfortable place with friendly staff, and delicious food. The pastries and dessert are awesome."}
{"text":"Cornish has some of the best food in the valley! We love their pastys and the scotch eggs are one that will always have me coming back. Tim definitely gave the best service we have had there by far. He was efficient and nice and gave great advice on the food. We will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in before the show at the Onyx last night for a casual dinner. Wow! Best variety of pasties I have ever seen. I had the cheese and onion wit HP sauce on the side. My sister hand' had HP before so had to taste it, thumbs up as a condiment. I love Guinness stout, they serve Murphy's, a decent alternative. My hubby had lamb and bro-in law went with chicken Alfredo. We were stuffed and all our choices were great, best outer crust I can recall having. Better than what we got our hands on during the last trip to  England. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I downloaded the yelp app just for this place. I'm already a fan and can't wait to come back. I enjoy eating vegan dishes when I'm dining out and I was pleasantly surprised that they had vegan options even though I didn't expect it at all. There's something for everyone.. Greek pasty's, Italian styled pasty's, Indian, traditional, and even vegan and vegetarian pasty options.   I got the peanut butter and jelly to go.. I'm pretty excited about that one too. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love this place, but skinny long bearded bartender is a jackass and has a bad attitude. Not good for business ."}
{"text":"A great way to hit 300 reviews!   We had heard only good things about this place, both on Yelp and from friends and co-workers that have been. We headed in and the black out curtains immediately made it feel like nighttime inside. After picking a seat at the bar we took a look at the menu and debated on the options.   I opted for the Shepherd's Pie (Cottage Pie) Pasty and he went for the The Oggie. We then decided to share a side of \"chips\" (i.e. fries). The best part of sitting at any restaurant bar, is getting to see the workers do what they do. This place was even better for that idea since you could not only watch bartenders mixing up drinks, but the kitchen was front and center, so we were able to watch our food be made from start to finish!  The food took a bit to come out, but each order is made fresh and the fries are baked, not fried, so it's worth waiting for. Both our Pasties were delicious and very filling! The fries were cooked perfectly, and it was nice to step away from the fried food world and still enjoy a great stuffed pasty and fries.  The staff was very friendly and checked in on us regularly. We were so stuffed we didn't get dessert this go-round, however, it isn't out of the cards for the next visit!  Overall: A A quirky \"hole-in-the-wall\" bar with amazing food, fun staff, and great ambiance. Go!"}
{"text":"Many months later review.  The food is delicious, inventive, and reasonably priced. What else can you ask for? I like the ambiance as well as the abnormal amount of hipsters you find here. I hardly ever see hipsters in Phoenix except for here! Also have good beer selections to go with the food!"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to the Arts District. On Saturday, I was at an event across the street and wanted some late night eats and according to Yelp this one of the few places within walking distance that was open late. Thank you for having late night hours for those that need your delicious pasties after a night of drinking and dancing. My friends and I inhaled our pasties (I got the Cuban which was delicious)."}
{"text":"First timer impressions, Yesterday, I decided to try this place with some friends just because of the great Yelp reviews it had. It did not disappoint at all. The food was delicious, I tried the Guinness Stew, Bangers and mash, and the Roast Beef (we shared some bites), all were amazing. We made plans to return this Friday and will probably become regulars."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I try to come here as often as I can. The peppered steak is my fav thing on the menu. Great place to come out with your buddies and have a beer eat some pastys and just hang out. Cornish pasty co for lyfe"}
{"text":"Yo, the food here is incredible. I have yet to try a pasty I didn't enjoy. If you've never had a \"pasty\", think huge empanada with delicious fillings, baked in a flaky, bread like pie thingy? You get the point. Great selection of beers which is an obvious plus, and free pool! Like billiards, pool. Don't get too excited. Pretty accessible as well being right off Charleston, so do yourself a favor and check this spot out.  Did I mention sticky toffee pudding? K byeeee"}
{"text":"This was so good. I guess it's a new location and the atmosphere was great. The kids loved the Scottish eggs and out pasties were all good. Had salmon, chicken, and bangers and mash. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"All I can say is pretty damn good...  If you're looking for some comfort food this is a spot you must check out for sure.  Good beer, food and atmosphere is dark and somewhat mysterious in a good way."}
{"text":"I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can't quite do it...  The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.  I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the \"premium\" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me.   Even that, I can write off to personal preference.  What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself.   It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back.   On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made.   I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses).   My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the \"kitchen\" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...  I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.  Maybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden..."}
{"text":"This review is only for the food. Our son works here. When he came home to visit, he brought us some of the pasties to try. OMG. These were so good. I tried both the Mexican and Italian pasties. The Mexican pasty had just the right spiciness and the Italian pasty was super rich tasting. When we visit our son, we will make sure to actually come in for a visit."}
{"text":"Incredible!   We called ahead to order for pick up because we wanted a night in but were feeling too lazy to cook. We ordered the \"Meat and Cheese\" - pork sage sausage and cheeses with red wine sauce and the \"Peppered Steak\" with Stilton and roasted veggies with peppercorn brandy cream sauce. Oh. My. Gosh. So good. So good that the next day int he middle of my work day I felt compelled to look them up on Yelp and give them a big thumbs up. The sausage was amazing...a generous amount of fragrant and flavorful sage. Yum! The peppered steak had just the right amount of Silton to be utter perfection. We were worried about ordering that one because it is easy to overdo it with such a strong cheese...but they totally have it down.  For dessert Boyfriend ordered the Banoffee pie which he loved. I did not like it because it was a LOT of graham cracker crust. If you like graham cracker crust this pie would be perfect for you. The caramel and cream and bananas together were heavenly.  By far, the crown jewel of the meal was my Strawberry Pavolva. It is made in a crisp meringue shell with fresh whipped cream and fruit. It was to die for! So so good. The texture was incredible. It is definitely big enough to share...but I'm not sure you will want to. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst place during an event night. If you Cannot handle a crowd the shut your doors. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Sometimes getting a table takes a while but it is worth the wait. My favorite is the carne adobada pasty and their apple dessert pasty (YUM!). The people that work here are always super friendly and prompt.  My favorite place to sit is the bar by the entrance because my friends I enjoy watching them make the food and striking up conversations with the people working there... sometimes weird convos but always entertaining. :)"}
{"text":"As a Brit and new to Vegas, I was feeling nostalgic and was really interested to see how good this classic good staple actually was. The menu was vast and varied, lots to choose from and the best part is they had a lot of authentic fillings, things I'd see back in the U.K. The portion sizes were very generous and the sauces were ideally paired to what you ordered (cranberry sauce, gravy, HP, ketchups), just a shame they seemed to try to fancy up the HP with weird spices - it's a classic as it is! We also got the scotch egg as my American partner loves them, as do I. It was nice, although a little too much paprika. I'm used to the good old ones full of sausage meat and served cold, which didn't seem to be an option here, but it filled the gap and did the job. Thankfully we got a seat at the front near the window otherwise I worried we wouldn't have been able to see our food - very dark in there! In general, very nice and if I ever crave a pasty, I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"Place was great! I got the roast dinner pasty and it was amazing! My boyfriend got the chicken pot pie and it was very good but mine was better! Wanted to try the dessert but we are saving that for next time!   The environment is really chill and laid back, defiantly a place to hang out with friends and drink and play pool. They also have a shuffle board table.   This would be a great place to have a birthday dinner with friends because you would be able to enjoy a great meal and immediately got to the bar area for more fun an drinking! And it is downtown so the after party could be anywhere on Fremont, grab a cheap room at on of the casinos down there (el Cortez, golden nugget) and don't worry about driving.   It is a sit yourself type of place, service is good she was very nice wish I caught her name. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix, it was mid-day and I was a little hungry. Noticing a sign for the Cornish Pasty Company, I decided to see what they had to offer. This rustic pub /restaurant had both upstairs and downstairs seating. Friendly wait staff and interesting and extensive menu. Lots of Pasty options.  I like beer and I am an avid coffee drinker .... so, it is no surprise that I needed to try the coffee infused beer. It was cool and refreshing on a hot day in Phoenix - surprisingly tasty. To compliment my beer, I ordered a pasty called the Pilgrim. I was delicious - small pie loaded with roasted turkey, grilled onions, stuffing and sweet potatoes. This came with a dipping sauce of red wine gravy and cranberries.   Good food, great atmosphere, helpful staff and competitively priced."}
{"text":"The food here is pure awesomeness.  I truly love the cornish pasty company. They offer plenty of healthy alternatives and they have a decent craft beer selection. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Hey, this place is really good. And they have sweet music. And it's cheap. And there might be some alcohol there. Go."}
{"text":"It was my first visit.  All my co workers have been talking  about this place....with that said,  ..........walking up to this establishment is not impressive.  Please do not take a 1st date here.  All I have heard is about the expansion..and thank goodness!!   This place is dark, the staff look like they are all on tour of some skating boarding ESPN tour  in town.  BUT!!!!  The staff  (who look like skateboarders) were great!  Each one of them so friendly, polite and very attentive.  Beer selection-par none...excellent selection on tab.   The expansion section is inviting for large groups...which was perfect for our work HH. MENU- as my friend would say......UNBELIEVABLE! I took home a Carne Asada concoction and it was sooooo good.  The calzone idea is great! When you can come up with creative stuffing you can't go wrong.    Ambiance 3 ..too dark for me  Staff  5+ -very friendly, attentive & polite Food 5+- the calzone spin -UNBELIEVABLE...so good.  even take home. Beer 5 -great selection on tab......can't get that everywhere."}
{"text":"Went here with my nephew when he picked us up from the airport. First thing we ordered was a real deal English brew \"Old Speckled Hen\". Had a few when we were in England and enjoyed it again in Tempe, AZ. The menu is plentiful! Lots and lots of delicious choices. My wife and I shared The Oggie, my nephew had the Cajun. They were incredible! The place has a unique atmosphere and the food and drinks came out quick"}
{"text":"Cool venue but the blandness of the pasty leaves much to be desired. Service is also neglectful"}
{"text":"All the pasties are delicious, I love taking new people here so they can check it out.  So far nobody has complained.  Very happy that they have 10x the seating now."}
{"text":"The food was fun and delicious. I'm not sure if this is true authentic British food, meaning I have always heard that their food sucks. :-/.  Well this was a good time and great food. I had the Reuben and my love had the pilgrim. Lots of food and very good. I gave it 4 only because the service seemed slow, but the place had just opened so I'm sure she was doing a lot of prep work. She was very nice though."}
{"text":"My friend has told me for years that I NEED to come here. So much wasted time...... I plan on making up for it though, I'm officially obsessed. So yum!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with Cornish Pasty Co.  I grew up in the U. P.  where pasties are a regular dinner, and today, I got a taste of home.  I tried the traditional pasty, the Oggie, and it was like going home.  My friend Had the shepherd's pie pasty and it was also delicious!  I definitely want to go back several times to try all the different variations they have come up with.  I hope they expand to more locations in town, preferably somewhere in the Southwest!"}
{"text":"Been to this location about 10-12 time, also been to the Mesa one 15-20 times.   Came to this location to tonight for the first time in probably a year or two and the service was so awful I felt the need to share.  I hate to do it, because the food really is good and they have a solid beer selection and decent prices, but this was the worst service I can remember in 15+ years of eating out.  Service here has never been great, but this was the worst I have seen it and compared to most other places around Tempe that have excellent service it was pretty abysmal.  It was only slightly busy when we got there, most tables were taken but usually only 1-2 people at a 4-8 person table.  We had a mediums sized group, 7 or 8, and were able to find a table outside.  Took probably 15-20 minutes before anyone came by.  The table hadn't been cleared from the people before us so fortunately there was already a beer menu there. Server did not clear or wipe down the table at all, just asked for our order. The menu has like 5-6 rotating beers, asked our server what they were. Rather than just tell us what the 5-6 were, he made us ask individually (they are categorized, seasonal,IPA, etc.).  He ended up having to list off almost all of them anyway (we ordered 3-4 of them), and this was the first indication that things would be difficult.    Drinks and food came out relatively quick.  No real issues here but only half of us were eating.  Server was not terrible friendly or helpful.  Acted annoyed when answering questions or having to wait at all.  Everything was bare minimum effort and it wasn't because it was busy.  The big problem came when the check came.  First, they pretty much ran us off.  No one asked for the check, it was 9:30 at a place that closes at 12, and the place was basically empty, but he just dumped the check without saying anything.  Put everything on one check, when the group was clearly individuals, and then pretty much refused to split it (3 different people asked).   Told us we could tell him amounts and he would charge them.   He had charged us for one item we ordered but they didn't have, I let him know and he said he would remove.  We do the math, give him cards and checks, and he brings it back.  Tells us pretty rudely we are $6-$7 short.  5 of that was his failure to remove the $5 item he billed us for and had just said he would remove.  I let him know that I am not happy that a) he billed us for an item we didn't get in the first place and b) had to ask him twice to remove.  Rather than just apologize, he gives me grief \"Whoa Buddy, nothing to get mad about\".  At this point it had probably taken 15 minutes just to take care of the check and everyone at my table was pretty annoyed.  No one had ever had this much difficulty with a check and he honestly would have saved himself a lot of work and hassle had he just split it from the beginning and not fought us about it every step of the way.  Would generally recommend the Pasty, but will avoid this location like plague from now on.  Been coming here since the location was essentially a hallway, but will not anymore.  Head to the Mesa location instead."}
{"text":"When my parents came into town from the northeast we had been on a search for a restaurant that had both \"meat and potatoes\" choices and vegan selections. So we went and adored it.  Needless to say when it came time to plan our wedding we chose the Cornish Pasty to cater it. They were so accommodating and gave us a wide variety of food. The manager John was super helpful in making sure all of our expectations were exceeded. We got 26 different varieties of pasties not to mention large portions of salad, Cole slaw, and mashed potatoes (which will make you weak in the knees!). Everything was fresh and hot and there was a flavor for every one of our guests!  We got so many compliments not one of our guests was disappointed. This made our day even more special. I cannot emphasize enough how important it was for us to have an organized, stress free meal due to the chaos of the day.  We have definitely found our new favorite restaurant.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"A very intimate setting restaurant. It's very dimly lit inside. There is a bar area as well as a dining area. They offer appetizers but are well known for their pasties. I tried the chicken tikka masala pasty and loved it. It's a very decent size portion and comes cut in two halves like a pizzone. Will come back again to try the other selections!"}
{"text":"This was my second time to the Cornish Pasty and I must say that I really enjoyed the food.  I don't think that I understand the concept of the restaurant though.  You walk in and it is like someone forgot to turn on the lights.  I have no idea why it needs to be so dark but it is hard to enjoy your meal.  I am all about a dive or a little hole in the wall but the decor and tables in this place are just too much to get over.  I mentioned to a friend that they must keep the lights out so you don't notice how bad everything is.  The waitress we had was just horrible.  She took forever to come by and when she did she was put off by our questions. She was able to offer a few recommendations as this was my fiends first time there.  When it comes to the food I loved it both times.  The three stars is based on the quality and taste of the food. Maybe next time we come by we will sit on the patio"}
{"text":"Allows a good experience for our family.   We enjoy the wide variety of pasties. Our daughter likes the Caesars salad too. We like to visit on Sundays after church, but it also looks like a great place to hang with friends at night.  Pool tables, shuffle.board, darts and entertainment is available in the bar area."}
{"text":"This was my second time in Phoenix and since we were staying around the Tempe area I could not let the opportunity pass us by of not trying the most Yelped place in all of Phoenix! I've never had a pasty before so I didn't know what to expect but judging from the pictures I had a general idea of what it would taste it. We came in fairly late around 10pm and since I was going to run the Arizona 1/2 marathon the following morning I opted for one of the lighter dishes. They truly have a wide variety of what would go in your pasty from burger, to Alfredo to even Indian chicken tikka masala. I ordered the salmon one, which I did enjoy. The crust went perfectly with the well cooked salmon. There was also spinach with dill sauce and other things that I can't remember. If I was feeling adventurous and didn't have to worry about eating light I would of ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala since our server said that was one of her favorites. Although we had no room for dessert we ordered a banoffee pie to go. This was really tasty as well great combination of bananas, gram cracker, whipped cream and caramel. From that Yelp picture the caption says it's Banana Cream pie, don't make the mistake of asking for it because our server corrected us and told us it was Banofee pie, haha! The inside of this place is a hybrid between a dive and a pub because it was dark and had community style tables. Our server was pretty good I guess but nothing memorable in terms of outstanding customer service. I can see why this is a popular spot among ASU students. Most if not all the pasty selections are less than $10. Even half a pasty is filling so you could even share one. Pasty places aren't too popular so I would definitely recommend trying them out. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but if I'm in the Tempe area I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Yesterday I decided it was time to introduce another friend to one of my favorite restaurants in the East valley.  We went to the Tempe location which is a lot farther away from home than the Mesa location.   But that doesn't matter because the drive is always worth it.  I like this location because it is the original.   This time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \"Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.   The chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalapeño and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie. It has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me. Another perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.  I know it's 7 am but I am heading to the refrigerator for the other half of my Banoffee pie."}
{"text":"I give credit where it is deserved, so thanks, Sean M, for introducing me to this place.  I love Cornish Pasty Co. The entrees are almost like hot pockets, which excites me. Normally when I come here I order the Eggplant Parmesan Pasty. It is so delicious! I could probably continuously eat them even though I am stuffed! No, Tabatha, you need to contain yourself.   The service is great and friendly. I really love to come here."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Cornish Pasty moved. When I was following the directions, I was so confused! This place is very spacious and I love how they used pews for seats. It was kind of awkward to get a seat at first because the waitress started to clean and then never really said that's where we were sitting, so that was a little weird. They didn't get a lot of their order I guess because the first couple of things my friend wanted they didn't have, like ginger beer and cole slaw. Coincidentally, the waitress was like \"We barely run out of things it's just those two you asked for.\"   Leek potato cream soup: I was a fan of the bread it came with. They give you this thick white bread that you can dip in your soup. The flavor of the soup was really good. However, after awhile I got tired of the consistency, very heavy, and I only got a cup.  Pilgrim: My friend and I told the waitress that we were splitting it so they were nice enough to cut it and put it on two different plates. We also got our own cranberry and gravy. This pasty turkey, cranberry, sweet potato, and gravy -- basically Thanksgiving in one bite. They give you the cranberry on the side, but I was kind of hoping they put it inside the pasty. This was pretty tasty with the gravy. The gravy was light which balances out the pretty heavy pasty.   Oven chips: I wasn't a huge fan. We asked to get it with cheese and jalapeños, but no cheese to be seen! I wish it was there because they put the jalapeno seeds in it and was way too spicy. My friend had to save it for the end because her mouth was burning. I just avoided all jalapeno at all costs. I wasn't a fan of the way these were cooked and definitely needed some salt or something.  Everything is rpetty reasonably priced, $8-$12. They have vegetarian options on the back! I really want to try their regular pasty, just to get the full experience."}
{"text":"We had a group of six last night.  Odd entrance but don't let that disease you.  Had excellent drafts, then a diverse menu, and some sides.  Food was spicy lamb vindiloo and fresh on a cod night.  Service in the person of Sarah was helpful, and very attentive.  We had so good experience we split three dessert s. Outstanding evening!"}
{"text":"Started with the incredible-edible Scottish egg! Bangers and Mash Pasty was as good as as they promised!! And saved room for dessert- Bannafee Pie!!! You could watch the chef making your meal and tell these guys know what they are doing!   Unsure about strip mall it was located in .. Took an extra turn or two to find it....but assured new location will be bomb!!   Must Try for locals!!"}
{"text":"i visited here for the first time on a sunday night before a concert. service was a tad slow, but the waiter was very nice & the food was great! i ordered the cuban & my friend ordered the royale with cheese... mine was WAY better! we also ordered the cheesy fries (chips) w/jalapeño & the jalapeño was insanely spicy! couldn't even eat it! this place is yummy & there are a ton of pasty options! i'd def come here again!"}
{"text":"I am from Michigan and grew up eating pasties from the U.P. I was so excited to find this place!  We got the original and a chicken pot pie and both were excellent!  It was worth the drive for sure."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I became a regular at when I moved to Phoenix 3 years ago. I love this place, my heart will always have it. Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is great. From the garlic mashed potatoes with cheese, to the vegetarian pasties to the P,B, and J pasty, it's all great. The employees are all helpful and extremely nice. A perk for me, is that I get to sit at the bar and watch my food get prepared. I love that. Great for lunch and especially great to pre-party before going out on Mill."}
{"text":"we NEED one in Tucson!!  my aunt introduced me to this place a few months ago and I couldn't get over how amazing the food was and how awesome the vibe is in here. super diverse crowd eating Cornish pasties in Arizona like it's no big thing.   flying back from cabo last weekend, stopped off for dinner on the way back down to Tucson and it was still amazing. and my brother liked it (and that kid doesn't like anything)!  just open up a small shop near ua campus in Tucson and we'll be all set, Cornish dudes."}
{"text":"We were told of this little restaurant by a client of mine.  Food was good.  Fresh, flavorful and unique.  Only a couple setbacks.  The music playing was quite loud.  It was hard to hear my husband speaking while sitting across the table from me.  Also, the restaurant was very dark and gloomy inside.  My husband tripped over a black wooden box set against the wall while seating ourselves.  This was a Sunday afternoon setting in the Tempe location that we visited the restaurant.  If you want good, home cooked pasties, and don't mind the dark atmosphere & loud alternative music, this is a place to enjoy a great meal at a good price.  Bring your flashlight so you won't trip."}
{"text":"I have been coming to CPC for 6 years and I've never had a bad pasty yet. My favorite are the Lamb Vindaloo and the Carne Adovada!! I promise you that once you try a pasty here you will be hooked for life!! Their apple dessert pasty is also as delicious as it sounds!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is a must if in the Phoenix area. I have never been to a place quite like it and loved the quirky vibes. Food was amazing! Come with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and their quality is incredibly consistent. Been loving this place since it was in Commercial Center. Now the location is close to my office so I will be visiting often for lunch. The pasty is like a really good and really big Hot Pocket, but A LOT better. They have many different types of pasties(sp?) to choose from so there is bound to be a flavor that tickles your fancy.  Another great option is ordering a pasty for take-home. They will make the pasty and you can take it home and warm it up."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am from Grass Valley, CA. It had the largest strike for gold in 1849. Cornish miners were largely the main work force in the town. This place takes me back to the historical side of my hometown in an intimate bar setting with great staff. The food is phenomenal and they serve my favorite beer! Wells Banana Bread Beer. It's great with an Oggie and pepper corn sauce!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in a couple weeks ago for something a little different for dinner - and we had a good time! We both had a beer and ordered a pasty. The food took a little longer than I typically care for, but when it came it was worth it, and the environment was cool to hang out in."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and service! This is our 3rd time coming here and it is great as usual!"}
{"text":"From the outside, it doesn't even appear to be open anymore! They really need to do something about that because of a few months earlier we drove up and decided it was closed so we drove away. This time I tested the doors because reviews are still being written. I am glad I did.  The place is weird though and dark inside.  We decided to eat outside and enjoy the nice weather. Unfortunately for us, the cooks go out to smoke within the distance of the seating area, and we actually had people smoking across from us. I assume no one follows the no-smoking law? Onto the food....that was our biggest surprise! It was wonderful. I tried the shepherd pie one with ground beef and loved it. And the chocolate bread and butter pudding for dessert were fabulous.  Now that I know it's open I would visit more! But please take note of fixing this place up to correct some issues both inside and outside."}
{"text":"More delicious than real british food ever could be!   reasonably priced and a fun place."}
{"text":":-) love the sunday vibe. Music, smiles, good crowd, great good, great service. They offer a huge selection of Whiskey and Beers out this world, seriously... have a drink for me. Type of music is 70's/80's/90's Retro Classic Upbeat Keeps you alert. (foots a bouncing). lol."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Don't be afraid of the outside because the place looks clean and new on the inside. Funny name pasty, but tried two pasties. Both were delicious and very filling. Oven chips are so crispy and not really greasy. Had Hibiscus tea and for dessert I had Shirley Temple's Pudding. All was excellent! The seats are interesting as well. Some are old cast iron tractor seats and the rest is old church benches. Like I said, interesting!"}
{"text":"This is our hangout and go to restaurant and has to be my first 5 star review, considering the number of times I have visited.  I first went to this restaurant in 2014 and there's no stopping since then. The place is very hipster, dark and packed. It definitely seems like a Sherlock holmes, batman night out.   There are days when I crave for their Mushroom soup. Its one of the best soup i have had. They have creamy, walnut filled mushroom soup, served with house made bread and heaps of butter. You will never get tired of their bread. Cream of tomato with croutons is good too. We generally order Tandoori wings for our appetizer, which is cooked to perfection, not spicy and served with celery and ranch. When it comes to pasty, they are the boss. Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more. Spicy Asiago chicken and chicken pot pie are our next options. Please save room for desert, each ones unique but Apple caramel pasty you will not be disappointed.  They have a wide range of options and this place is definitely heaven for vegans too. The service is really good and you will find a lot of young hip crowd. The price is definitely reasonable and a great place to hangout with groups. I will keep visiting this place."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Cornish Pasty. I love the vegetarian options and the fact that they have a daily vegan menu is awesome. This is a great place as a destination or a before/after place to grab a quick bite. The food is consistent and the service has always been top notch. They pay attention to the lighting and music volume which is super important. So glad it's near my neighborhood. Great job Cornish Pasty."}
{"text":"What can I say about how awesome this place is beyond what's been said in the other stellar reviews?   Staff is friendly and always attentive, and the food... OH LAWD THE FOOD. It's like, remember when mom would make comfort food that was hot and delicious and gave you that feeling of complete bliss? Yeah, it's like that, but with beer.   Anything with the red wine sauce is delicious. My favorite so far out of the 5 or 6 I've tried is the Shepards pie pasty. My mouth is watering thinking about it right now...   Boyfriend and I split a pasty if we're looking for a hearty but light lunch. Dinner time though, it's on.  Oh and the SOUP. Potato leek is the bees knees but I really love the texture of the walnut soup as well.   Keep doing what you're doing pasty masters!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here. I'm not sure if I got something that you should get. BUT the bread or crust was really excellent. The service was good as well. All in all it's different than the average place to eat ."}
{"text":"The Shepard's Pie Pasty was really good. I really liked the dark ambiance of the restaurant too. Good food, good beers and good times!!!"}
{"text":"As if this place needs more high marks.  I used to drive by the place all the time and my so at the time used to joke about Cornish Pastys being what Cornish strippers wore in non nude establishments.  All I can say is yum!  So one day, we took the plunge and stopped by after work.  It's dark but not dank.  Narrow but not crowded.  Tasty but not super fast.  Pasty may not be a good every day staple.  But it sure is tasty!  I have tried at least a half dozen menu items and none have steered me wrong but for the real \"flava\" I'm gonna recommend you stick with the more traditional stuff.  Otherwise you could just end up eating a calzone in disguise and seriously... who wants to eat a Cornish calzone?  The staff is nice, and friendly.  The vibe is decent and if you like meat (or veggies)  and potatoes (which may technically be a veggie but is class by itself you know) stuffed into delicous bread.  You will feel as if you have died and gone to heaven.  Do not be fooled by cheap imitations! This is not some gussied up hot pocket or some savory pop tart! This is the real deal!  After eating this you'll be ready to go into a coal mine and work for .. well no. That may be stretching the truth.  But the food is really good.  One time, I preordered from this place and got a bunch of parbaked Pasties for a Christmas Eve celebration.  They were a big hit."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Ordered the Cajun and it was spicy and dlishish!!! My husband had the Shepard pie and it was even better...the only downside is the location and parking suck."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger royal pasty is amazeballs! Plus today's musical selection was Motörhead and you can't go wrong with meat and metal music!"}
{"text":"OK OK, so I gave it another try and you know what, I'm convinced that it is actually pretty damn good!   The key is....order your pasty well done or extra hot or whatever you want to say. I even heard another guest sitting behind me ask for theirs cooked extra hot!   So this time I ordered the Pilgrim....Turkey, Stuffing,Sweet Potatoes and grilled onions served with a side of their Bomb-Diggety Red Wine Gravy and cranberry sauce. (see pics) LOVED IT!!!!  I'm craving it!  I ended up splitting with Nathan S. and also got to try his Chicken Tikka Masala (see pics) which tasted very much like real authentic CTM.....although I did feel it was a bit spicy for my taste I liked it and the yogurt sauce helped cut the spice.   So that being said I ordered 2 Pasty's to go to bake at home and let me tell you that is the ticket! The hotter they are the better they taste!!  The Fam agreed they were a hit and once again Super Mom saves the day!   P.S.  Strangely enough there was no mention of our dessert???? NATHAN? I'll let you take care of that. I guess you didn't like it?"}
{"text":"Good Service, Fun time has a really good vibe. The service was however a little slow but it was busy in there so I was fine. English style is really cool and the menu is a wide ranging not in number but scope and everything I have had is good so for."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night with my husband and two friends. It was an interesting experience with a few hit and miss dishes. The place is located on Main street in Downtown. The parking is limited and away from the location (street parking primarily) so be prepared to walk a bit if it is busy! The place has a dark bar setting with cool black/white photos of Irish children. It definitely pays homage to their culture that started pasties to begin with.   FOOD: We had the following dishes:   Scotch Egg - hardboiled egg wrapped in sausage & breadcrumb w/ honey mustard. This was an interesting dish that was okay. I wouldn't order this again. The egg tasted over cooked and dry. I am more of a runny yoke type of gal, so I don't think this was a good dish for me to try.   Cream of Tomato w/ Crouton soup was SO TASTY! It was rich, creamy and warm, which was perfect since it was really cold outside. I would come back to try this again.   The Oggie Traditional Pasty - Steak, potato, onion & rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy. The red wine gravy is amazing!!! Even the pasty dishes that other people ordered that didn't come with the side of red wine gravy ordered it because it was that yummy. GET THIS! If I could add this to ever carb dish I had, I would. lol The Oggie pasty was good, but it tasted amazing with the red wine gravy. However, BEWARE - THESE DISHES ARE SUPER HEAVY! I  could only finish half of mine. I reheated it in the oven the next day and it was still tasty.   Oven Chips w/ Garlic and Jalapeno. This is hand cut British style chips cooked in the oven seasoned with cracked pepper & sea salt. I'm not sure if the kitchen messed up, but the chips we received were soggy. I enjoy more crisp fries so we didn't eat much of it. If you enjoy soggy fries, then I would recommend this dish for you.   People at the table also ordered the Guinness Stew and Cajun Chicken. However, I didn't try it but the person who ordered it said it was yummy.  BAR: They had a lot of beers on draft and a full bar. I would definitely come back here to drink the hard ciders again. :-)   PRICE: All the items were reasonably priced. Everything was around $9-10 a pasty. The cup of soup was $4. So I would say Cornish Pasty is about $15-$30 a person depending on what you order.   SERVICE: We were greeted and seated the moment we came in. Our server did an excellent job checking on our table.   Overall, the experience was okay. The red wine gravy was the highlight of our meal. But, I wasn't too fond of the soggy chips and the Scotch Egg entree. Service is great. I recommend ordering the Oggie Traditional Pasty and Cream of Tomato soup.   Happy Dining,   J Tran"}
{"text":"This place is delicious (as EVERYONE says). It's really not somewhere you can go often though because the food is SO heavy. However, you must go at least once in your life.   The wings. GET THEM. I think it's the tandoori chicken ones? They are indian inspired and probably the best wings I've ever had.   The pastys are really hit or miss. Some of them are delicious (um, the lamb one...!) and some are just okay (the reuben..eh). Drinks are normal, they ran out of the beer I actually liked so I had to settle. But, my friends did like that they always have $3 Irish car bombs so that's definitely a plus!  I've been to the ones in Tempe and Scottsdale and the service is a little slow but the waiters/waitresses are super nice."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  have had cornish pasty in Bathe, England and fell in love with these little pockets of goodness.  I love that they have a great selection for veggies and meat-eaters alike.  I like that you have the option for communal seating, and love the BIG steins of beer!  The servers are always pleasant and I cannot wait until the one on Monroe street opens!"}
{"text":"Took some coworkers here who had never been to Cornish Pasty.   We sat downstairs in what used to be the old Monroe's bar.  Which is always a happy trip down memory lane.  I nerded out on everyone and explained the story behind the pasty.  Our food took a lil while to get to us do to lunch rush hitting.  To be expected downtown.  I had the vegan vindaloo and it was so delicious.  Another coworker got the Italian and she loved it.   All in all everyone had a good experience and loved the downstairs cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"i've seriously had hot pockets that tasted better than the pastie i got here last night. i ordered the royale, and i don't know if it was the mushrooms, or the seasoning they use on the burger, but something was off and it left a yucky taste in my mouth for hours after i ate it.  i am a very picky eater, and the pastes cannot be modified. most of them (90%) contain onions or some other strange vegetable that i don't like so it's really not a good place to go unless you like a ton of shit thrown in a pastie. i think it's too much sometimes. the mashed potatoes were dry and not very garlic-y whatsoever.  our waiter was an asshole. i ordered a black and tan with strongbow and a nut ale and he informed me that they wouldn't be good together. refusing to take some douchebag's advice, i ordered it anyways and it was delicious. he didn't care to check on our table at all throughout our meal, and no waters were brought to the table...halfway through we got switched to a very nice young lady. i didn't mind the set up of the bar, it was very english pub-like and actually enjoyed the atmosphere. the beer selection is impressive.  i was disappointed after all of the great yelp reviews, i was expected to be blown away by these delicious little tasty treats - unfortunately they just didn't get it right this time."}
{"text":"More than anything, I appreciated Dean's response to my initial (unhappy) review.  The fact that he responded to the concerns I brought up in a professional and constructive manner, by mentioning that he would address them with the staff, was sufficient to persuade me to give it another shot.    My boyfriend and I just gave Cornish Pasty Co. another try, and were very happy.  The service was very good--our waitress, Katherine (sp?), was excellent, and did a great job of describing beer selections and making menu suggestions.  I ordered my usual pasty, but we also tried a few other menu items (some of the soups/side dishes), and they were excellent.    I am glad that this visit was a positive experience, and I hope that this trend continues in the future, as I will be glad to continue my patronage here."}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas local, I'm always searching for a unique and delicious restaurant that isn't full of tourists and preferably located off the strip. I've driven by this establishment a few times during my visits to the arts district and finally decided to give it a try today.   The atmosphere was exactly what I was seeking. Unique, off the strip, Arts District, smoke free, eclectic, and welcoming. The decor is warehouse meets English pub. The wait staff was friendly and way cool and very attentive. The bar area is set off in the back, with a string band setting up in the stage, which was a pleasant surprise. We arrived around mid-afternoon on a Sunday so the entire setting was just awesome. The band was amazing and they also have pool tables, shuffle board and darts - all for free.  Let's talk about the menu. Wide arrange of appetizers of what you'd expect to find at an English pub. The pastie selection was huge. Everything made fresh daily so a few items were gone by the time we arrived, but there was still plenty of delicious items to choose from.  I ordered a Maker's and coke, and shepherds pie pastie. My husband ordered a Boddingtons and chicken pot pie pastie. Everything was hands down DELICIOUS. The pasties were fresh and served hot. The crust was perfection and the taste - NAILED IT.  We will definitely be returning. My only regret is that it took me so long to stop in and give it a try. Hooked. Delicious. Go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by around 6pm on a Monday with a friend, the place was pretty empty so we were able to find a spot very easily...the first person who saw me looking around approached me with a huge smile and told me they had 3 levels and to sit wherever, very nice first impression.  Ordered the broccoli & cauliflower cheese bake to start which was pretty good, had quite a bit of cheese and veggies...then I ordered the Cajun chicken and my friend got the Italian. The crust was perfect and all of the ingredients worked well together. Overall the service was great and we had a good time, only reason I gave them 4 stars was because our appetizer and the pasties came out at the same time which is always annoying to me."}
{"text":"Very unique place to eat.  Has a little bit of everything.  Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good selection of beers and food is on point. They have Darts, pool and shuffle board! My friends and I loved it. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am upping my review to 5 stars.  I recently made my second stop here and got pasties for 2 dinners.  We had some that night and I froze the other two for a later day--today in fact--when I needed to have a good dinner done quickly.  After volunteering for the National Park Service for 10 hours today, I came home tired and hungry.  I had taken the pasties out of the freezer, they were thawed, and in 20 minutes, I had a good dinner for the two of us.  We have now tried the Oggie, a Cottage Pie, a chicken Alfredo, and a peppered steak.  Tonight's peppered steak had sirloin pieces, leeks, zucchini, and Stilton cheese.  The sauce was excellent.  My wife enjoyed her chicken Alfredo.  The staff was super when I was there and I know this place will be on my stopping list often!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever ordered from here is delicious.  The staff is friendly and the beer looks great (I don't drink during lunch :()   The restaurant is a bit small making it challenging if your in a big group.  The good food takes a bit of time and can be a little heavy for the middle of summer.  I recommend checking this place out and enjoying the unique food they have to offer."}
{"text":"Yep. I'm in love with a pasty. My buddy April F. and I decided to check out all the hype. We went during our lunch break so it was not very crowded. As much as I am familiar with commercial center (no, I'm not a frequenter of the Green Door), the location was not readily visible. It's in the middle part of restaurants in the center of commercial center. The decor is very hip using old church pews for seating. The music must have been on a British Rock playlist which I appreciated.   ON TO THE FOOD!!! I ordered the Oggie and she got the Cottage Pie. Maybe it was because it was the middle of the day but I was informed that I could not order mushy peas (my favorite!!) and the pasties took about a half hour to come out. WORTH THE WAIT!! I slowly cut off a piece of my piping hot pasty, dipped it into my accompanying red gravy sauce and gently placed it into my awaiting mouth. SO DELICIOUS!!! I washed it down with my fresh lemonade (no alcohol since work was after lunch boo!). Perfection.   I really like that you can order half baked Oggies to bring home. The service was good despite the seemingly long wait for the food but I get it takes a bit to get those bad boys nice and crispy. We will definitely be back and definitely during a time when we can wash our pasties down with some of the beer on tap. Next time, I will also attempt to save room for dessert since it looked pretty amazing.   In summary, WORTH THE HYPE!"}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to find this place? It's kind of tucked away on the side of a shopping mall with very little fanfare. If you peek in you may think its just a bar, and indeed, they have a great selection of beer for such a small restaurant. However, it's much better than that. The Pastys--large hot pastries stuffed with meat and/or veggies--are fantastic and come in dozens of traditional and not so traditional varieties, including many vegetarian-friendly versions. Some of these utilize fake meat so something of the taste of some of the traditional meat pastys can be enjoyed by all. Some of the more eclectic pastys have Greek and Indian flavors. They all come fresh baked (you can watch the crew make 'em) too!   For $7, I was nicely filled, and got to people watch the varied crowd and crew of Cornish Pasty, all of whom seemed to enjoy making these unique hot pastries. In fact, they were so busy it was a little hard to get some attention. For example, I waited comically long for my bill to be picked up and charged.   No worries though. I can read my paper or talk to my friend while I enjoy the warm memories of my pasty."}
{"text":"Wow! My son I and went here on a whim and I am so glad we did.  The meat and cheese pasty is tasty and filling.  We are a condiment family but there is no need for help on these babies.  Although the gravy and dripping sauce were superb, we hardly touched them.  The restaurant is dark and unimpressive but don't let that deter you.   Our server was super nice and responsive.  The order took a few extra minutes but it came out piping hot and fresh.  The entire experience made us want to visit the UK."}
{"text":"This place was a winner.  I don't eat around Tempe too often and when I do I'd like that experience to be unique.  I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.  To me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.  Inside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)  Their draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.  Most importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.  We unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\""}
{"text":"Hoku the best ! Great as always, very friendly knowledge about food and beer   The pastes are to dye for.  We had again the masala   Kinda spicy but the yogurt side  made it very pleasant The pasta salad it's a must to try !! We just love this place and Hoku ! Commercial center must be proud of this little gem !"}
{"text":"And, my dear friends, that's four stars based on takeaway ALONE -- I can imagine, when accompanied by the legendary array of British beers, this will easily make the coveted five star mark. Yummy, greasy, down-home comfort food goodness... and enough vegetarian selections to keep me going for quite a while. Looking forward to having a meal there!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is AMAZING! Whether you want something for lunch, dinner, or even a filling hangover meal, this is your go to place! Every time my friends visit me here in Arizona, it's one of our first stops that we make! Great food & tasty beer!"}
{"text":"Best stopover for food when you're lit (weekends or weeknights), done after work downtown, and also takeout.  Had about 7 different pastys by now, main is the bacon and cajun cause their sauce on the side brings it all full circle.   I can always get one thing from here or multiple things so definitely a regular here.  The other pastys are a little heavy but they have a lot of selections to choose from.  You won't ever regret the pb&j pasty with ice cream!"}
{"text":"It's like a buttery, flaky, delicious dream... I had the Guinness stew pasty and wanted to melt into it's savory, filling, and yet delicate arms for at least the whole afternoon instead of the 15 min it took me to devour that delicious pie. I ate it in the car and was so mad that I wasn't actually sitting down to fully respect and enjoy it. That was Saturday. It's Monday. In the meantime I have also had the chicken tikka and balsamic portobello, unapologetically. If I lived closer to this place I might need my friends to stage an intervention. What's also amazing is that they will sell them half-baked so that you can take them home and finish baking them for later consumption. Not as flaky and perfect as when they do it in their ovens, but still delectable. I will be back to try EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Finally a good solid English style pub and pie place in town. The location is in downtown the only challenge here is parking. I tried the chicken Tikka masala pie  which was awesome. And my friend tried the vegan option.   These are really big size pies, giant ones folks. It's enough for ones dinner Good spot, and I will be back to get my pie fix. A must try if you're in downtown. U will not be disappointed  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE!  For vegans, vegetarians or meat-eaters, this is definitely the place to go if you want hearty food, a good cider (or beer) and a hip place to eat!  (Call ahead if you're vegan so they can make your pasty up fresh w/out the butter.)  The taste...well, to die for.  I've had both the meat and the veg pasties and I haven't found a bad one yet.  Usually I can only eat one pasty...but if you starve up for a bit beforehand and have enough room, the desserts are awesome too.    The ambiance of this place rocks!  Black and silver, British-pub nostalgia is the theme, and you'll find that the waiters are cool, hip people and the staff, busy busy busy right in front of you cooking up the next batch of pasties. So, if you come alone, no worries...prepare to be entertained by the huge staff working in the kitchen (which is right across the bar from you).  Alone, with friends or even w/the kids, there's something for everyone here...there's even a yummy peanut butter and jelly pasty for those picky kids (or discerning adults ready for dessert)!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot...downstairs is a small, intimate dining area with a bar and large, comfy booths. Romantic if you want it to be. The main floor has wooden booths...not as comfortable as the ones downstairs tho. Pool tables upstairs!  The food...we mostly eat vegetarian pasties...the Cuban is my new favorite other than the ever-delicious Tikka Masala. Lovely bit of salmon is tasty too.  Ask for the vegan pasty of the day...the vegetable vindaloo is one is great. Cider on tap. You can't go wrong here. They even have gluten free items...you can bring your paleo friends and make them jealous by eating a pasty right in front of them. ;P"}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant. When I pulled up I thought the place was closed, till I drove around the corner to see everyone eating outside. I walked in to what looks like a blues club, very dark lit but unique with huge tables. I ordered the Original Pasty with the \"chips\" and it was so good. The service was awesome, and I'm going back with my family as soon as possible."}
{"text":"If no star was an option! We stopped in on a Friday night and despite my better judgment we waited for 20 minutes and decided to leave. The hostess could not provide a wait time as people tend to hang out. I'm pretty sure it was cooler outside than inside. It was dark, dingy and disappointing. Although I did not see the hostess list before we arrived I'm pretty sure tables after our arrival were seated first. We left and pursued another venue."}
{"text":"Interesting pub concept. Many beer selections that are nice with the pastries, of which there are many diverse cuisine choices"}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is friendly and place is small and intimate. Food is amazing!!!  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. I am a guest at the Hilton right next to this place. I sat down , the waiter intentionally got the order from people who came 5-10 minutes after me. Then he gets my order I wait for the food 30-40 minutes. In the mean time the other party had a soup and a pasty already and enjoying their conversation. I just flew into Phoenix and had skipped lunch and dinner. I am hungry but I was ignored the whole time. I felt weird sitting their looking like a fly on a wall. I came back and ordering at 12.30 am Uber eats and waiting for my dinner at the hotel. What a day!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss the nights that started with a meat & cheese pasty and a pint (yes, a pint) of Ketel One & Coke.  Great food & strong drinks, what more does a guy need?"}
{"text":"Ok so there are plenty of great reviews of this place already but I'm going to throw mine into the mix as well.   The food here is fantastic, but if you've ever walked in there around lunch time you could probably figure that out from the crowd. Everytime I come in I try a new one and I'm always happy with it, I've yet to come across a pasty I didn't like here.  When it comes out you might not think it's that much - but portions are deceiving because the food's pretty heavy. My main tip to you is only eat half and then pause to let it sink in - take a break to drink your beer or something. I always force myself to save the second half and it makes me much less sleepy when I head back to work after lunch :) Plus it makes great leftovers."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. The atmosphere was fun. And our waiter was so helpful. I can't wait to make the trek back out there. I may even take the hubs this time!"}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty has been a favorite of mine for several years now. The food is amazing. I'm working my way through the whole menu, and I haven't ever ordered something I didn't like. The desserts are fab, too. On top of the food being great, the ambiance of the bar is great. My friends and I love to go there just to grab a beer, even if we're not in the mood for food. Great service and selection. I recommend this place to everyone looking for something new."}
{"text":"Another great local restaurant. Atmosphere is pretty chill. The food is good! Pasties are a must have and there is one for everyone! I suggest the Scotch Egg and/or Tomato Soup for starters. Definitely worth checking out when your downtown."}
{"text":"This place is great! The pasties are like being back in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. All the employees are awesome, the whole place is just relaxing. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"3rd time here and by far the service, food, and environment has been 100!  This is the place to go for a good filling and great drafts! Recommend ordering the meat & cheese with oven chips! You will not be disappointed with portion and that wine vinegar sauce is FIRE!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Love the food love the vibe. Salmon Salad amazing!! Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem.  An explanation of the food just doesnt do this place justice.  I am currently on my 10th different pasty (Just tried the Pilgrim) and I haven't been disappointed in one yet.    There is a great vegetarian menu as well.  I haven't ventured into this area of the menu yet, but all of those choices look just as delicious.    Every time I try a different pasty, it becomes my new favorite.  I'm sure you will feel the same way.  Dont pass up the $3 Irish Car Bombs!  Its so good when it hits your lips."}
{"text":"I have tried both the pesto chicken and the spicy asiago chicken. Neither were really that amazing, as I was expecting from the reviews. It was good, but not amazing. My friends that I've come here with agreed. The people who work here are so nice though, service was great. The pasties are very filling, you will leave stuffed (I couldn't finish a full pasty in one sitting).  I'll probably go back sometime to try one more pasty, maybe I was just expecting too much?"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm DELICIOUS! I had the carne adovada pasty and the BF had the cajun chicken pasty. We were both in love! Stuffed with meaty awesomeness! Fresh ingredients and fresh out of the oven. They are cut in half and one should probably eat the other half as a midnight snack or meal the next day, but why stop when it's just so darn good!? The oven chips and other potato option was also amazing! Great outdoor area with giant tables. Lovely beer list. Friendly service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went here with a group of 7 after a show at the Smith Center. The staff was friendly and attentive. They helped us make selections and gave recommendations. All the sides were spot on and all seven people were satisfied with their Pastys. The best of the sides was the curry roasted oven potatoes, which were crispy and nicely flavored with curry. I had the bangers and mash pasty. They make their sausage in house and the sausage had a nice burst of rosemary. The red wine gravy complements the pasty in the best way. Desserts were also delicious. The best dessert was the sticky toffee pudding which was served bubbling hot in a mini cauldron with a side of cream anglais. I can't wait to come back and taste even more of their menu."}
{"text":"There's a few places in town that I end up trying after awhile that just don't live up to the hype or high ratings that really disappoint me. Cornish Pasty was not one of those places.   You have to love a place that actually sells out of things- that means they are serving up and dishing out quality food! Those sell out items would be things I need to order earlier in the day next time.  Anyways... Cornish Pasty moved down town from the famous plaza that Lotus of Siam was previously at. They house a very low key and chill restaurant and bar that also has some pool tables. I also hear the back area hosts concerts at time. They have a big selection of beer on tap and a full bar. The center of the space is the kitchen where you can watch the chefs preparing the different pasties and other dishes like wings and their famous scotch egg.  Oh yea! Pasties are basically small meat pies. This restaurant has literally like 40 different ones ranging from your typical and non typical meat filled options, vegan and vegetarian options, and also dessert pasties! I had their cheeseburger one with thousand island and wow it was like an in n out burger on steroids. The crust was perfectly crusty and buttery and the meat filling was seasoned by the gods. WOW! I also recommend their tikka masala and the Reuben also comes highly recommended. One pasty is a big portion and if you are having a couple beers I can definitely see someone splitting one of those bad boys.  I loved Cornish Pasties and am excited to go back. Everything ranges around $7-$12 and for the food quality and uniqueness of the dish I just think it was great. The bar tenders are great and the restaurant is well kept. They definitely get all the stars."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and am so glad I checked it out! My friend had the tikka masala salad and I had the pot pie pasty. The meat was flavorful and the salad fresh, my pasty was perfectly seasoned, held together well, with a flaky crust that practically melted in my mouth. I could hardly finish half, and the other half is in my fridge for dinner! I can't wait to go back and try the cottage pie pasty next."}
{"text":"Awesome! This was one of the first places I tried since moving to Tempe and it is so good. Don't be fooled by the strip mall appearance from the outside, what awaits you inside is the most glorified hot pockets you'll ever taste!"}
{"text":"Totally Impressed!!   Don't let the location deter you... This is a hidden gem of great food.  It's worth the trip, locals and tourists will like this place.  We came here today for lunch because of Yelp and were very happy with the results. Although kinda dark inside, the place is welcoming and the waitress was really nice and took care of us as we listened to an eclectic mix of music from Bowie, Joy Division, and Dick Dale which really set the mood for a good time.  We ordered curry potatoes, an Oggie pasty and the Reuben pasty.  All food tasted great and was hot!  Cooked to perfection with great flavor.  The only criticism I have is some chunks of corned beef in the Reuben were large dices and tough to chew..I was hoping for only sliced meat, but it was still great.  My husband is from Michigan, where pasties are well known and it's pretty hard to find a good pasty anywhere else, except here... we will definitely return."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the Cornish Pasty (pronounced past-tee), you have not really seen the heart of Tempe. It's a little place, not really good for groups or kiddos, but when you enter you truly fee the atmosphere shift, and guess what? Now you're part of the cool crowd. The food is so good! I love their mushy peas for a starter (although half of the time they are out) and then the Pilgrim to seal the deal. It's like a Thanksgiving party in your mouth any time of the year! All of their food is great, and this place is always busy it seems. Don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you like being in small spaces with a million loud drunks. Mid-afternoon is the best. The servers are usually pleasant, but some have a better-than-you hipster attitude. But hey, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on Tempe's best kept secret!"}
{"text":"It was one of those...why haven't I come in here sooner kind of things?!?...Let me tell you just how yummy it was! The vegetarian cheese tray app, omg me & the bestie were in heaven. We love trying out new things...First time eating a pasty and they did not disappoint-vegan and veggie ones were bomb...took a cottage pie home to my picky meat & potatoes hubby and he devoured it! Coming back-I need more cheese in my life...lol Ambiance was very cool, loved the church pew seating! Cool for groups or date nights!!!"}
{"text":"Swung by for some lunchy lunch at 12 PM on a Thursday for a departmental meeting.  This place came highly recommended from our #1 analyst, who's also an astute foodie =)  Service: \"Dylan a.k.a Mommy\" was taking care of us.  Except for our ace analyst, this was everyone else's first visit.  Dylan explained to us that the pasties were pre-made, so you couldn't add/remove ingredients which I rarely do anyways.  She gave 3 pasties suggestions, we tried them and they were all a hit.  100% af!  She kept the waters filled and service didn't waiver after this lunch surge of 4-5 parties appeared out of nowhere around 12:40ish...  Pasty+: I had my first Scotch Egg this afternoon.  Great appetizer that compliments the pasty coming. I went with the \"Royale with Cheese\" Pasty - Hamburger, French fries, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, cheddar Swiss blend, all inside a pastry?  This sounded like a cheeseburger combo stuffed into a pastry that I wanted to know more about! The ranch dressing was the perfect compliment.  It seemed a little salty to me, but my tolerance for salt is lower than most people.  I'm not complaining at all, the Pasty was awesome. Just an fyi. We shared the bubbling sticky toffee pudding with an ice cream on the side.  It came out steaming in a small kettle and was fantastic.  Next time, I'm getting one for myself. =)  Value: Pasties were $10 and the appetizer Scotch Egg was $5.50.  For the tastiness of the food vs the price we paid, that's hard to beat.  The portions were perfect as we were content but not stuffed.  Ambiance: Industrial inside with a English theme and VERY spacious with lots of seating.  We saw a section with Church Pew seating, (Sorry, forgot the trigger warning =) 2 Bars, 2 Pool tables and the longest bar top shuffleboard game I've ever seen.  Ultra hipster vibe with music in the background at the perfect level as to not disturb table conversation.  Summary:  I'm definitely stopping by here in the evening in the near future.  The beers on draft were high quality and I love the spaciousness and vibe in general.  If you've never tried a Pasty before, this is the place to be for your first experience.  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Great place and nice staff... Delicious food and variety .. definitely we'll be back"}
{"text":"Vegan review: The downtown location of Cornish Pasty has much to offer vegans and vegetarians! The location itself is awesome. You can pick between three levels (basement, main floor and loft) and the patio - which is a rare treat in Phoenix. It's the perfect dark, cool spot to beat the summer heat.  They have a vast array of vegetarian pasty options and always have up to four vegan options on hand. I've had the vegan southwestern pasty before and enjoyed it, but had a hard time believing it was vegan! They used a mock chicken - probably Gardein - and vegan cheese. However, the vindaloo is my favorite of the vegan options. The first time I had it, it was almost too spicy for me (which is rare) but my second try had the perfect amount of heat. It was a little heavy on the potatoes, and they could have been cooked more, but it was filling and delicious. The best part is always the crust!   Service is fast and efficient - no issues. And the location is close to everything. So if you need a cool place to eat and drink in downtown Phoenix, don't overlook Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"Am i just ordering the wrong thing?   I have been to Cornish several times over as its kind of a go to spot if in the area that you don't have a terrible wait for. Also the fact that it has a shuffleboard table, and pool table is fun as well to keep you entertained as you have a bite/drink. But there was only once on the 4-5 times that i have been where my food was overly impressive, and that's when i tried my friends Reuben. I have ordered the All Day English Breakfast, a Royale, and the Pilgrim and all had this odd dry chalkiness to them. I stole a bite of my buddies Reuben and it was moist and flavorful, so that has what had me come back on more than one occasion in hopes it was just the ones i ordered. It's not bad food, it just seems to be hit or miss with the taste of whats on the menu. I don't make it a point to eat here but i will give them a chance from time to time."}
{"text":"Omg ! The Peanut butter pasty is to die for !!! I got mine with an apple cider and it tastes like the adult version of my childhood. Mama used to make my pb&j's toasted with bananas and this is the closest thing to how mama made it . It's incredibly naughty but I you're wanting a meal that tastes like a flash back to your past and you have a constant sweet tooth like myself then this is what you should get. The atmosphere is laid back and the drafts are unique . This place is a must go!!!"}
{"text":"Second time I've came back to this place, the first time that I came I had already eaten - saw the menu and decided I had to come back and try something!  My date and I ordered the pilgrim and the herbed beef - they were both delicious. My only complaint was that the center of mine was a little cool, other than that the food was great.   They also have a nice list of craft cocktails, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had the meat and cheese pasty and the banaoffee pie again. Still just as good.  Really busy for a Thursday night and a little slow on the service because of it. Enjoyed it much more the other times when sitting at the bar, so definitely suggest doing that if it's available. Also, disappointed in the music choices - it was like swing jukebox music and did not fit the restaurant at all. While the food is super delicious, for the price (~$8.50) the pasties should come with a side of mash or something.  Definitely do not pass up on dessert either."}
{"text":"I've been to the Cornish Pasty Co. in Tempe many times and have paid visits to the Chandler and Scottsdale locations as well but this is my first visit to the DTPhx location since it (seemingly took FOREVER to be) opened. I really love what they did with this building with the garage doors and patio seating. It was perfect for the overcast cool day and we came in here to check it out for lunch.  Unfortunately, my time here was marred by the extremely slow service. When coming in for lunch in a place downtown, on a Monday afternoon, the servers should be aware that everyone has to get back to their own jobs within a certain time frame. Pasties that are made ahead with a couple of ice waters should not make for an hour-long visit. We also made the mistake of getting a dessert which just tacked on more time and we had to flag down the server to get it to go after sitting waiting for 15 minutes. I've never had a problem with wait times before so I can't  say if the staff just wasn't on their best game or what, but it was really disappointing. I absolutely love CP Co. but I'll make sure to skip this location unless I have plenty of time to spare."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places to eat in Vegas.  There are a lot of great places that are even vegan, but there is only one I know of where the best Pastys (like a calzone but a million times better) and fine beer abound.  The ambience is great - casual pub with good music ( Neon Knights, currently, Dio era) and the service is always pleasant and low key.  If you are an Australian and are looking for the hard monsters from your homeland, sorry.  If you are anyone else and want to eat something incredibly good, come here.  If you want overpriced strip junk or to be coddled go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We took our friends to the new Old Town Scottsdale location and sat on the patio on a beautiful Friday evening. It's much more charming then the Tempe and other East Valley locations we've been to. The food is always delicious--I love the red wine gravy that comes with some of the pasties. The service was really neglectful that night and we were charged twice for one glass of wine that we asked two other servers to bring or find our server. We got it straightened out. They are very nice; just not 'on it' that night."}
{"text":"Somehow there's maybe 1-2 British/Euro pubs in Tucson, but Phoenix has the whole market covered, including this establishment. I've always enjoyed meats and savory ingredients stuffed inside pastry dough, and I'm glad I tried my first ever pasty here.  The cool part about this place is the open kitchen concept. Sitting at the bar, enjoying a pint with your pasty and chatting it up with the bartender, you also get to see the pasties being made from start to finish.   The prep and wait time are both worth it (about 25-30 min wait). These things are a meal in themselves and the quality of the ingredients is very fresh. I went with a classic shepherd's pie. Lots of ground lamb, potatoes, peas, carrots and cheese. And the pastry was cooked perfectly. Washed down with a proper pint, you get a satisfying meal.  The only downsides were of no fault to the restaurant itself. A lot of the patrons seemed to be bar hopping as a few drunk girls didn't know what pasties were (pronounced rhyming with \"hasty\" thinking it's the decorative thing you put over your nipples) and asked for really specific mixed drinks, one guy broke a glass by the entrance, and one 40-something Guy Fieri type didn't know \"what are those pastries.\" The music was loud and likely a playlist the cooks put together as I wouldn't think of Metallica and Black Sabbath pairing with pasties, but I give it a pass because they are hard at work and just want hype music.  So, do check this place out for a proper pasty, but don't feel obligated to eat in house. They also ship their products, which is a plus until they open a location in Tucson."}
{"text":"My friend has been telling me that this place will blow my tastebuds away.  I wouldn't say it blew my tastebuds away, but it was very good.  Decor: I like the music and the vibe of the spot. It's very mellow the booths kinda seem like old church benches.  Food: I had the potato and Stilton cheese soup to start. This soup packed a bunch of flavor and is perfect for dipping the sourdough bread it's served with. For my main dish I ordered the pesto chicken pasty. The lady I was with ordered the chicken Alfredo pasty. The chicken pesto pasty had too much artichoke for. The Alfredo pasty didn't have nearly enough Alfredo sauce. It was pretty dry. I will def go back to try more tho, it's hard to choose with so many pasty options.  Service: the service is the main reason for the 3 stars. If I had better service, I would likely have given this spot 4 stars."}
{"text":"Started patronizing this Cornish Pasty location when they were just a hallway and a kitchen.   The place was awesome, with food you couldn't get anywhere else in town, and a great selection of craft beers.  It was fun to sit at the counter and watch them make the pastys.   I wish that I'd reviewed the place previously, as I would have given them 4 stars over probably a dozen previous visits but I wasn't really a Yelper then.      Now the place has expanded significantly, and it appears business volume has kept up with this expansion, which means they are almost certainly profitable.   And that's what makes my last visit so hard to understand.    First, our table in the back corner of the dining room -- the glass surface was broken from what was likely a few too many full plates and empty pints being forcefully put down on it, and it appeared as if many a beer had been spilled on that section of the table because the metal latticework under the cracked section of glass was a mysterious dull brown moldy/mildwey color for a good 2\"-3\" to each side of the glass.  But the lights were dim and it didn't smell so we decided to ignore it.    Second, the men's room -- I stepped in here after we ordered but before our food was delivered.  This was one of the most disgusting restaurant men's rooms I've ever been in.  There was a lot of urine on the floor, broken tilework and molding everywhere. There were several paper towel dispensers, all of which were empty and appeared broken anyway, so I was forced to go find toilet paper to dry with after washing my hands.   All of the toilet paper rolls were sitting out on the back of the toilet or on top of what at one point had been a functioning tp dispenser.   To acquire some toilet paper meant picking the roll up off of a surface that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days or maybe weeks.  I wish I hadn't glanced at the toilet.  There are dive bars that don't even serve food with bathrooms that are 100x as clean as this one was.   Third, our food -- When I came out of the horribly filthy men's room, I should have immediately cancelled the food order and taken my family somewhere else for dinner.    That men's room was a sign.    My beer was not hot, but not cold, just cool.  It should have been a lot colder.  The three of us all ordered different pastys, mine was the Royale with Cheese, and we all felt sick late that night and into the next day.  If just one of us had felt sick, chalk it up to something else, but Cornish Pasty was the common denominator.    Finally, our service -- Our server was actually great.   She was prompt, checked up on us frequently, and got our orders exactly right.  She did a fine job, and the other stuff we experienced was not her fault.  I tipped her out well.  What I noticed though, was that while the place was slammed, other employees were, at times, inexplicably wandering around the restaurant with their phones held out in front of them, distracted, not paying attention to what was going on around them.   Not sorry to be an ass here - you're at work.   Snapchat your friends and Pokemon Go ANY OTHER TIME except for right now.      I don't care how slammed you are, how unique your food is, how close you are to the largest university in the nation or how many times I've been there in the past and been happy.  You can't manage a restaurant this way, there's absolutely no excuse for it.   If this place were to have received a health code inspection the night I took my wife and 17 yr old daughter there for dinner, I have no doubt they would have failed.   This is management's responsibility and ownership should hold them accountable."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The food is great here.  Had the meat and cheese pasty and could not stop eating it.  That red wine gravy is to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing. This is one place you really got to try out. Overall the service is reatty dam good (most of the time.)"}
{"text":"When I was told we were going to Corrnish Pasty I thought it was some kind of kinky strip club...I wanted food not freaky. When we walked in, this restaurant was dim yet inviting at the same time. We sat at the bar around the \"kitchen\" which was neat to see them make everything. To hear the story of how a pasty came to be was interesting, but the actual pasty itself...well that was simply AMAZING! I particularly enjoyed the chicken pot pie pasty and the strawberry pavlova for dessert. If you're in the area and want to try something new, Cornish Pasty Co. is the place to go."}
{"text":"One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.  Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.  Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.  We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! You feel like you're in a little, off beat restaurant in Chicago or New York, instead of Phoenix! The service is very friendly. It's a small place but the food is excellent and big! If you've never had a pasty, you must try it! It's like a pastry filled with love!   I usually get the Cajun Chicken Pasty which is filled with spicy chicken, bacon, ham and swiss cheese! Today I'm trying the pork sausage, potatoes and cheese!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what a \"pasty\" was before coming here, and I was actually a little wary of trying something that sounded like nipple coverings.  Thankfully, Cornish Pasty is lacking tassels and the like, simply serving up deliciously magical pockets filled with wonderful themed concoctions.    My personal favorite is the reuben, where the pastrami and corned beef is tender, juicy and chewy at the same time, the buttery crust is perfectly flaky, and the 1000 Island dressing is something I enjoy smothering everything in.  I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.  Their craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.  Much more comfortable, less claustrophobic, and easier to get around."}
{"text":"Calm before the storm on a Saturday night. Awesome environment regardless. Art is really different which sets it apart from other pizza joints. Pizza IS REALLY FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Say it with me... PASS - TEE.  These do not go on your nips.  They are delicious pastries stuffed with meat and cheese and all manner of amazing things.  It's also one of the few places in phoenix where you can order a draft Boddingtons to wash it all down.  I like sitting at the bar and watching them make the pasties while you drink and eat."}
{"text":"I've been on quite a tear recently with my \"To Try\" bookmarks. Late this afternoon, I was suggesting to my friend that we pre-game to make sure we were full after restaurant #2 (more on that in the near future). This place popped up in our brainstorming and we went for it.  Cornish Pasty Co. found an home in a rather decrepit plaza which happens to be home to the legendary Lotus of Siam. CPC is right next to Komol, and you'll wanna know that the parking spots right in front are angled in the wrong direction if you're approaching from the street. A bar proudly dominates the center of the restaurant, and tables line the outside. We sat at the bar for a change of pace, although we weren't imbibing any potent potables tonight.  I originally wanted only one pasty, but my friend convinced me that we should get two so that we could each try two. Conveniently enough, the pasties are cut in half, and they were willing to provide extra dipping sauce for free.  I tried the bangers and mash ($9.00) first: sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes with an interesting red wine gravy. Friend didn't care for the wine flavor, but I appreciated that it wasn't just plain gravy. Second up was the lamb vindaloo, which I ordered for the lamb-ness although I found the vindaloo was dominant. The Indian spices, unfortunately, are not in my wheelhouse, the spicyness was definitely a challenge for my delicate / capsaicin-sensitive tongue, and the yogurt sauce was just odd and didn't quite complement the lamb vindaloo. I'll take the blame for most of this, but I'm going to hold the yogurt sauce against CPC.  I've gotta say, though, that the pasty shell around each of the fillings was quite good. Very flaky and golden brown, yet not burnt at all, and just the right thickness so as not to distract from the filling. I'm sure that I will enjoy the experience more fully next time when I only pick pasties that are appropriate for my palate, but I still highly recommend that you try the pasties promptly."}
{"text":"Finally!  I have been wanting to see what this whole Pasty meat pie thing was all about.  We finally found ourselves on this side of town and in need for a quick casual dinner so we decided to come to the Cornish Pasty Co.  When  you walk in, it looks like a bar with a few tables around, it's a tiny little place but very cute and cozy.  We took a seat at the bar but realized we were seated right in front the sneeze guard window where the chefs make pasty's right in front of you.  We decided to move on the other side which was a little more open. We ordered the cottage pie and a bangers and mash with a side of the oven fries with garlic and jalepeno.  Even though you would think the cottage pie (ground beef with mashed potatoes and peas) sounds too much like bangers and mash pasty, the flavors of the meat were both really different.  Both pies were delicious and when paired with the red wine gravy, made it that much better.  The pies were bigger than we thought and we ended up eating only half of it since we wanted to save room for dessert.  For dessert we went for the chocolate and butter bread pudding with creme anglaise.  The dessert definitely meausured up to the pasty's and were delicious as well.  I already want to come back and try them all!  *It's pretty much an open kitchen and if you are sitting at the bar, it may get a little warm since you're so close to the kitchen and the ovens are running all day."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company is one of those rare places that makes you feel like you're somewhere special. A unique concept - at least I've never seen any other pasty restaurants around - makes this place truly one of a kind.  I have two favorites when I'm there. 1. the Royale with cheese with a side of ranch. 2. the pilgrim with a side of red wine gravy. The Royale with cheese is what you think it is - burger related. It's hamburger, cheese, onion, mushrooms bacon, and the best part - fries all snuggled into a flaky pasty crust. I like to dip mine into ranch for that classic burger tastiness. The Pilgrim is thanksgiving dinner. It's turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and onions. Served with a side of cranberries and gravy.  I always have a hard time choosing between the two because they are both so delicious.   The place itself has a cool, laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly.  The pasties do take a while to make though so expect to wait a while. These are not fast food in any sense of the term. If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Especially at lunch.  Also, their seating is really best set up for groups of two.  This is not a \"take the whole family out for dinner\" kinda place. They have a couple tables in the back that can seat four but the majority of tables are two-tops and then there is space at the bar.  No question, Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite places in the valley."}
{"text":"English style pasty, fresh homemade dessert also. Just opened 2 months ago, reasonable prices. I definely come back to try more different pasty!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that a few weeks ago I ventured back down to Tempe for some pasties and was pleasantly surprised at the level of service I received. It was like night and day from the first time. The server was so sweet, so attentive and she really couldn't have been any better!   I got the chicken tikka masala pasty and it was delicious, but a little too spicy for my taste buds. My bf and I each got a shepherd's pie to go and had them for lunch the next day. They give them to you partially baked, recommending you cook them the rest of the way right before eating. As we both ate them at work we cooked them that night and just re-heated them in the microwave the next day. Even reheated in a microwave they were so good!   Special props go out to the amazing server that bumped my rating up to 4 stars. :)"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy that I will normally take orders home too! Love it! My favorite, which is tough to choose, might be the Cottage Pie."}
{"text":"Pros:  Great food, large food and beer menu and great layout with three floors. Friendly staff.     Cons:  poor execution and preparation . When we came, thy ran out of several entrees as well as basic items like chips (French fries) and most appetizers.    I have been to the other Pasty locations in Tempe and Scottsdale and they are great.  This location needs work."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with lots of people. Some people don't like British food, but I enjoy it. It takes awhile to get your food, but if you call ahead for take out, they get it to you quickly. The only issue I have with this location is the lack of parking. It's the same as anywhere in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of my cousins and some fitness. We were a large group and our server was able to handle all orders and got them all correct. I arrived early and ordered the pie smasher drink, it is very tasty if you like bourbon and what makes it interesting that it has a balsamic vinegar reduction in it.    For my meal I ordered the Reuben Pasty and it was delicious every bite til the end. Definitely recommend this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Always.. So..Delicious.   This place does it right. In an assuming building in the commercial center off of Sahara Ave., This place is a welcome addition to the local food scene.  Seriously fantastic. I'm a big fan of fresh baked goods, savory or sweet. Cornish Pasty has it down.  I've had 5 or 6 different Pasty's.. and both the mushroom walnut spinach soup, and potato leek are two rich and delicious reasons that I frequent spot place!  Service is friendly, and the price for a meal is just right. Give it a bite! You'll be glad you did! Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"The carne adovada pasty is delicious! Self seating, just go in and find your own seat. The atmosphere is very unique in a good way. I just wish it didn't take so long to prep the pasty!"}
{"text":"Kristen and I are practically regulars here. I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome.      The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be.  The food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews.      If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. You having nothing to lose."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place ever since I'd heard about it last year, since we were in Vegas for the week we stopped by for lunch on Monday. First off the space was really well done and was in the Las Vegas arts district which is definitely worth a visit as well. We ordered some oven roasted chips (fries) and split a pasty that had beef, cheese and onions baked inside. The crust was the best part, flaky, buttery and perfectly done, and the filling was tasty too. The chips were good too, and the portions are large so we split the pasty and the chips. There is also a large full bar in the back and very interesting pics of Cornish miners since that was were the pasty originated."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Located in the strip center of the Siam Thai restaurant and next to Komul Thai restaurant. I came in for lunch during the week and the place was fairly quiet.  I heart the decor and layout of the place which is on the smaller side. This was my first experience eating a pasty which is was staple of miners in Britain and is a pastry folded over with a filling of meat, vegetables, etc.  - The selection here is very diverse and the pasties are made fresh daily.     I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton cup of soup served with fresh soft bread. Oh it was delish and I finished every drop. My pasty choice was the Lamb and Mint - Lamb, potatoes, rutabaga, onion, and fresh mint. Instead of the side of red wine gravy I requested the chicken gravy to meet my allergy diet requirement. It took probably 15 minutes for my pasty to arrive and it was cooked perfectly crusty crisp on the outside and the inside filling hot and flavorful. I asked for extra sauce which my friendly waitress promptly fulfilled my request.   I'm definitely going to returning here again!"}
{"text":"I like that you can spend couple of hours here eating drinking and playing on pool tables. I like their soups and vegan options.   The tikka wings are the best."}
{"text":"I was here on Wednesday night with a group. The service was weak at best and we were never told about Wino Wednesday - wine is supposed to be $4 per glass before 6.  That sort of stuff is so annoying.  And she wasn't any help with selections either.  But of course the food does not disappoint!  The Leek and the Red Pepper soup were great - the bread is awesome.  Loved the cheese steak pasty - would have liked to of been asked which side I wanted - the mustard cream was good - the red wine gravy would have been better.  As long as the food is this good though / I'll keep coming back and try to rely less on the service. Knowing what to expect makes it less disappointing and it wasn't the worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pros:  The soups, especially the mushroom.  The bread. The pasties have been on point. The wings, which was a great surprise.  Cons: The soups are too salty which is unfortunate b/c I go mainly for the soup.  Uncomfortable seating. Too dark. Sometimes takes a bit for a server to notice that you've sat down."}
{"text":"You had me at Hoegaarden and lamb vindaloo pasty.  I came in here a little drunk from cheap drinking at Ra and was starving!  My friend and I looked over the menu, and couldn't decide between which pasty to get.  Luckily, the waiter was extremely patient with us and even helped us decide on which one to get.  We ended up with the lamb vindaloo and the chicken alfredo.  It was only a short wait until our pasties arrived.  They were huge!  Way more than enough for two people.  Both were extremely delicious and flavorful, and I loved the sauces that came with them.  I would definitely recommend getting different pasties so you can split them up and share them.  Great food at a great price!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"When my co-workers offered to take me to lunch for my birthday I began to think outside the box for places we had not tried or perhaps had never even heard of.  I found Cornish Pasty Co. and that fit the bill rather well.  I spread the word and requested we give it a try and the co-workers obliged.  So five of us piled into a tiny compact car and drove the couple of miles to the Commercial Center on Sahara and went to one of the dining establishments there within.   We were the only dining party in the entire restaurant.  No surprise since we were there at 11:00 AM right when they opened.  Obviously we were seated right away in a corner booth with what seemed to be old church pews for benches.  It was not the most comfortable seating but it worked.  I did notice some intriguing bar stools around the bar area.  They are old metal tractor seats.  I also noticed the loud hard rock music playing.  I heard the White Stripes, Iron Maiden, Metallica.  Not bad.  It took us a few songs to carefully look at the menu and make our meal time decisions.  I settled upon the eggplant parm pasty.  It was stuffed with cheese, eggplant, zucchini, brocoli and basil.  Served on the side was a small cup of marinara that tasted very fresh.  My boss ordered a reuben pasty that looked amazing.  I don't recall what everybody else ordered but it all looked good and everybody seemed happy with their meal.  I was the only one who finished my meal.  The lightweights of the group all asked to take their meals home for later.  One eaven ordered a pasty to take home for her husband to bake that night.  What a clever idea that is.  A take and bake option at an otherwise dine in establishment.  We are fans and have added Cornish Pasty Co. to our rotation of dining out options.  Now I just need to go back after work to try a pint of Boddington's Pub Ale on draught."}
{"text":"I like the mushrooms pesto pasty I had treated my friends her on bday and they liked the chicken tikka pasty the servers are good"}
{"text":"Having learned to love pasties while living in the upper peninsula of Michigan, I was delighted to find this restaurant with it's traditional and authentic Oggie.  The pastry crust was perfect,  the filling savory and tender, and the wine gravy   unexpectedly delicious. I truly wish they would open another location in Colorado Springs or Denver."}
{"text":"What a joy to finally come across town and eat at Cornish Pasty. Located in the Arts District on downtown LV, you might miss it driving by by its unassuming exterior. However, once walking past the massive iron and wooden doors, you're greeted with a dark, eclectic interior with a British pub flare.  There are some long communal eating tables, fitted with church pews for seats, and of course many two and four or more tables with chairs. Overhead lighting is dim and each chandelier or fixture is different from the next. On one side of the bar there's also pool tables and shuffleboard tables, and kitchen in the middle, the other side a large bar with a plethora of beers on tap, many speciality crafted from different breweries, and full spirits and wine.  Since meat pies are the main staple (called pasties actually, you know the British influence for colorful analogy is apparent). There's so many choices, it's almost too hard to choose. They also have appetizers such as tandoori wings (outstanding), Parliament wings (delicious), jalapeño bean dip with house made pita chips that are somethin' special, salads and soups, everything in unique and creative flavors.  Now, onto those pasties. As I mentioned before, the wide selection is almost too hard to choose. I choose the chicken tikka masala (my fondness of Indian won me over). It was spicy and delicious, a tad too heavy on the green bell pepper flavor for my tastes, but the red spicy curry chicken and cubed potatoes was still excellent. Would still order again. My hubby ordered his fave meat pie, chicken pot pie/pasty, a standard mix of peas, potatoes, carrots, in a toothsome gravy, he said it was delicious. Our two pals joining us ordered the Guinness Stew pasty, steak, potatoes, etc. in a Guinness spiked gravy. Our other companion decided on the Roast Dinner pasty, steak, candies carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts in a cheese and rutabaga gravy. He said it was fantastic. They have red meat, pork, chicken, fish and vegetarian choices.  Dessert was ordered, although we were so stuffed, we decided on the apple-caramel pie with vanilla ice cream, so scrumptious, and the dark chocolate bread pudding, which was heavy, but divine.  Service was awesome, our server was attentive, friendly and expeditious. Total bill, minus tip, for four pasties, three appetizers, two desserts, 4 microbrews and a vodka-club was $140. Not bad for the pleasing atmosphere, food and service. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"EVERY. SINGLE. THING. WAS. AMAZING! Pastries, bomb ( and inexpensive!) Moscow mules, the English tea, the place is really cool looking, the service is great, I fell in love with the church benches, highly recommended  Update: We're back. Today we feasted on #bangersandmash #theitalian #royalwithcheese #portobellochicken #shepardspie and #roastedredpotatoes ... #highlyrecommended"}
{"text":"Heavenly! You know it's good when you feel bad about not finishing the whole thing. I wish we had one of these back home. Morning flight and this was our last stop.  I'm so glad glad we came here! I love the bar atmosphere and the service was seriously great."}
{"text":"MUST TRY: Potato & Leek soup!!!!!!!!!!! Arguably the best soup I have EVER had, and it's served with warm bread. The Pasties are also so delicious, of course. The crust of the pasties literally melts in your mouth. We also ordered the Chocolate Bread Pudding....wow! The liquor in the bread pudding also gives it a nice, warm kick.  Service was great, and the waitress took her time giving recommendations since it was my friend and I's first visit. The vibe is sort of hipster, but so relaxing.  Will definitely be back!   UPDATE: After coming in nearly every week for months, I've made a couple new observations. I really wish they would work on their customer service. There is only a couple of waitresses that actually do their job. The rest seem to disappear indefinitely. Food is still amazing and well drinks have good amount of liquor."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! The food is finally something different from the normal bar fare you find at most places in this area.  If you've never had a pasty...stop reading this, get in your car, and drive to Cornish Pasty Co.  They have a gigantic menu with everything from veggie pasties, to indian and mexican pasties, and everything in between.  So far I've tried The Rosemary Chicken, The Pepper Steak, The Pesto Chicken, and The Mexican, I'd say The Rosemary Chicken was my favorite, but it really depends on what kind of mood you're in, there's really no way you can go wrong with any order...hey anything with that much butter in the crust could never be bad!!! ;)  The only thing I would change about this place is the happy hour.  A dollar off drinks doesn't really blow my skirt up.  Maybe some food specials???  Well, at least Irish Car Bombs are only 3 dollars all the time...but I don't always feel like forgetting the entire night...hmmm, guess I'll just pay full price for my experience...it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The space is cozy, the drinks are cheap, and the food is homemade.   Short Version: Hot Pockets!  Long Version: Hand-crafted dinners of seasoned, good-quality meats and veggies (or vegetarian options) wrapped in a flaky, buttery, baked, melt-in-your-mouth carbo-load of a crust. The menu runs the full spectrum and includes the standard list of limey choices plus salmon, mexican choices, indian, vegetarian, and even a cheeseburger complete with french fries - IN the crust! Food is hot and fast, service is outstanding (anyone can and will help you), and the soups are to DIE for - chunky yet smooth, appropriate levels of salt, and fresh ingredients with flavor that really pops.  They also have $3 Irish Car Bombs. Boo-YEAH!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The food was Amazing and Simple. I ordered the Porky which has pork, onions, apples, potatoes, sage and a side of red wine gravy and fell in love with this dish. This dish was perfectly blanaced with just the right amount of sweet and saltiness and the crust was perfect.  They have a pretty good drink selection here and the service is great. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been going to here since the day that it opened and even had them cater my graduation party when I got my degree from ASU. If you cannot appreciate Cornish Pasty Co you have some sort of problem dealing with restaurants.   They will not molly coddle and treat you like you are some sort of special patron. They are just too busy providing some of the best pasties ever created. Service is not what you come here for, pasties are!  Be sure to ask them what the Vegan selections are, they are usually pretty amazing. Especially if you put gravy on them! (The gravy is totally not vegan, neither am I...having evolved as an omnivore).   Now they have a patio, as well as more seating and a nice bike rack! Classing it up CP! Just kidding, this place is not classy, which is why it is so beautiful and amazing."}
{"text":"This place is open, but it doesn't look like it from the weather beaten facade. When we came in, it smelled gr at! We had the potato soup which tasted great, but to me the potatoes we undercooked and maybe not well washed as a few bites were gritty. The soup came with fresh baked bread which was delicious. The oggi pasty was very tasty. The tikka masala pasty looked great when it came out as well. However, we noticed just after our waitress brought us a side of tahini that a cockroach was walking down the wall towards our food. We alerted the waitress and moved tables. She was apologetic about the roach, but it got away. Our waitress brought our bill to our new table right away, but there were no breaks on the bill. We had lost our appetite so we paid up and left. The cockroach is stil there. If you see it, say hi to it for us! Two stars for the food."}
{"text":"Went for a  solo late lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. Really friendly service that took the time to explain the menu and beers. First, the place seems super clean. Also the great beer selection is reasonably priced.  I had the Oggie pasty and loved the perfect and pepper potato, beef and rutabaga filling, which worked very well with a cold Joseph James beer($4!!). My goal is to try every pasty on the menu(except the vegetarian ones!) Great place to dine alone or with others."}
{"text":"Once again, another brilliant addition to the rejuvenation/promotion of the Downtown Arts District... a dangerous walking distance from the Hop Nuts Brewery tasting room! On a rainy Christmas Eve after slaying the beer board at Hop Nuts, bro and I sauntered over here to fill our bellies with pasty goodness. I've had pasties in London in my lifetime, but my brother is new to the concept, so here we go on our British food adventure!  We decided to split a Shepherd's Pie pasty and an order of the oven fries. Sadly we were already so full of beer that we couldn't fully enjoy the enormity of their amaaaaazing beer and cider selection! Plus, $4 car bombs!!! It's ok.... definitely next time ;) This place is SO BIG, so we opted to sit on the service side (where the seats are recycled church pews, haha). The other side seems to be more of a bar (with pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, etc.).  Anyway, the food came out fresh, after somewhat of a longer-than-expected wait. But let's keep in mind that each pasty is handmade and freshly baked, so that's completely okay :) But the Shepherd's Pie was perfection! Perfect ration of ground lamb to veggies, seasoned super nicely with a touch of spice (not heat, but more flavor), and the crust was to DIE for. Oven fries were also surprisingly flavorful -- you can't go wrong with sea salt, cracked black pepper and roasted garlic. (And of course we left the to-go box there, booooo.)  I cannot wait to come back here and show off Cornish Pasty Co. to all our friends and family! Especially the beer connoisseurs -- they will go CRAZY for this joint! Cheers to wonderful service, finely done food, and a super impressive beer board!!!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place and still do...great food, drinks and service. The downtown locations is quite nice. Hey, chef, I know it's the rosemary chicken pasty but you don't need 10 sprigs of rosemary in there next time ok, I don't want to eat a christmas tree....  I'll still be back though!"}
{"text":"When my voluptuous girlfriend said we were getting pasties in Las Vegas, I titillatingly thought, \"Ohhhh, I hope they are the ones with tassels.\" As we drove into the seedy and run-down Village Square shopping area, going past the Lotus of Siam, the hunt for pasties was on. Then oops, we walk into the dark and junky interior of a bar. The pasties were really English bar food and similar to a Wellington or a meat hand pie.  \"The Oogie\" pasty had potatoes, onions, rutabagas, and unevenly distributed beef. My favorite filling was the rutabaga which added a different dimension. As a pot pie prostitute, I loved the thick and hearty crust. The super beefy gravy on the side was also very good. Even though I love lamb, the lamb and mint version had a strange taste that I couldn't pinpoint. I couldn't eat it.  When I first saw a photo of a Scotch egg, I immediately wanted to try one. Just seeing a runny yellow yolk spilling over the fried sausage began my elusive hunt. I found it here, but they used a hard boiled egg that was cold. The egg was served on a salad with honey mustard dressing on the side. This dish seemed oddly like institutional food, but that might make sense because that would describe most English food."}
{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite place!  The potato and leek soup was seasoned perfectly and the bread....come on R u kidding me. I bought a whole loaf and took it home. I got the oggie and was not disappointed at all. Husband got bangers and mash and it had so much flavor. I loved that everything we ordered was seasoned perfectly and didn't need to ad salt and pepper. The taps are rotation too which is much appreciated and I always lie a place that understands good beer rather than bud light. I can't wait to come back and try another one!!!  I live in summerlin and wish I had one there but it is worth the drive for me!"}
{"text":"Really dig the food here.  Everything tastes great.  My wife was a big Cornish Pasty food fan prior to us finding this place, and I have to say that she made me a believer when she brought me here.  The food is tasty and bona-fide as far as I can tell.  Did not know that they made the Tempe location dark on purpose to mimic a mine--thought it was to go along with the emo/Goth/lots of tattoos and face piercings crowd that appears to be in attendance--which is great if you're into that sort of thing (we're not).  The Mesa/Chandler location is a bit more open, lighted, and civilized (in terms of face piercings).  Very pleasant and helpful service coupled with tasty victuals, minus the face piercings = 4 stars.  Hate to have my personal bias short them a star, but it is just a bit off-putting if you're not expecting it (and if you show up wearing your Sunday best)."}
{"text":"Was looking for a unique place to have my last vacation meal and this place did not disappoint. I got The Pilgrim which was delicious, and I managed to finish every bite. Liked the ambience here a lot too - was expecting a grubby pub, and although this place had the pub feel, it was definitely more upscale than your typical pub. Great place to try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"So far not so good. I had to go through 4 different beers to find one they weren't out of. We ordered a scotch egg as an appy...nope, out of that too. So we ordered the Cornish meatballs...and strike 3. I hope when I get my food it at least tastes when I get it."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we found this restaurant after spending the day at the nearby Botanical Gardens (which are not to be missed).  The place was dark on the outside - blackout curtains.  We thought it was closed.  But when we went in, we found a lively place, full of waiters with beards and tatoos.  The pasites came in many varieties - as a party of 3 we shared all and they were different and delicious.   A not to be missed place."}
{"text":"Took my parents to lunch here on a family trip to Vegas. Loved the look inside, ample seating, the church pews were a nifty touch. Menu offered a hearty selection of pasties, including veggie options, all freshly made and ready in about 15 minutes. Go hungry because this is not the tiny pasty you may have seen at a fair. Happy that we made the time to stop here."}
{"text":"First time to this place. Had been looking forward to the get together with my friends. Drinks and food were all yummy. Service and outdoor seating excellent. Definitely will go back again. Try the potatoes w cheese and garlic and we loved the Italian pasty. Ask for some ranch, it's home made and very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit for me, any time I'm in Vegas or Phoenix. The food is delicious. The portions are just short of hearty but not disappointing in anyway. I would recommend getting the pilgrim"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the look of this place, but that was all. Everything is a Pasty! I had thought the English Breakfast was an authentic English Breakfast. Silly me, it is all thrown together into a pasty and not a very good one. The cooks really turned my husband and I both off. I thought anyone preparing food had to have hair nets, especially giant, facial hair. The thought of free beard hair falling into the pasties was a gagger. All the employees looked like they should've worked at Harley Davidson. The music was way too loud for an afternoon. We all had to shout to converse. I would go there to drink and play darts or pool, but the grungy employees and no variety other than what goes in your pasty, was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"We had the chicken pot pie pastie and the traditional (beef, potato, rutebega, cabbage) pastie. Kids and adults ate and enjoyed. The pasties are delicious and huge. I would have liked the filling to be a little more saucy. I know the wine sauces served on the side are meant for dipping and that would have been nice if we like wine sauces but no one in our family does. Tastes like your Cornish grandma is in the kitchen lovingly making pasties for all to enjoy. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Go here for the food and to have one or two drinks. This is definitely a place to start a long night in Tempe or a place to order take out from when you are just watching a movie on the couch all night.  Their European beer selection is pretty decent for a place that just one fridge holding it's entire beer selection (Yes, they have Boddingtons).   The Pasty's are great! I typically order the Bangers & Mash one, while my girlfriend orders Chicken Pot Pie with extra gravy, which she swears by. I've read good reviews about their desserts, but I've always been too full.   Definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is super awesome! Lamb and Mint was delicious, I recommend trying something new each time... I received excellent service, and every staff member I encountered was unique and friendly; and really seemed to fit in with the \"mood\" of the place.  Seating inside is a little awkward, I believe there's just a bunch of pews lined up and from time to time you'll get sat right next to a family that likes to use their elbows.  Deserts are to die for: Try the Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have loved each pasty I've gotten. The lamb vindaloo had a nice kick of spice and the sauce complemented it perfectly. I'm a slut for a runny egg so the full English breakfast was delicious too! I've tried the wings and they were super spicy but in a great way, also had a really nice flavor. The banofee pie was also delicious, wasn't super heavy so it was a good end to the meal if you want something sweet but are already pretty stuffed. They have a good selection on beer, and the staff is always courteous if not a little slow sometimes. I'm lucky enough to live right next to this location and usually come around 5 or 6 and there are a good amount of people but seating has never been an issue. Overall, a really tasty place I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best Pasty in AZ!  I love the vegetarian Mexican.  It can get pretty packed during lunch may want to call ahead if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"I love the Past Company.  Everytime we go the food is delicious, the staff is awesome and the beer is flowing.  Stopped for lunch for a break from Christmas shopping and got ordered our usuals.  God I love the Roast Beed Sarnie."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I usually get the Chicken Rosemary Pasty, but I ventured to the Italian this time.  I wouldn't make it my favorite, but it was still excellent.  Their selection is broad.  They have great crust.  I love the Apple Pasty for desert!  Now if they would only open in Henderson."}
{"text":"I try to make a monthly visit to the pub and get my grub and drink on when I can.  I love the atmosphere but the seating situation can be bothersome at times.  The food is good ol'fashioned heart stopping goodness coupled with cold brews and service that's mindfully busy.  Bring talking and thristy company because it can be a wait sometimes but when you have patrons guzzling down mad amounts of brew I can totally understand."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner and were not disappointed! The service was great and very fast (we told them we were starving, because we had just flown in form Ohio). The place itself is rustic and mismatched and super cool. We sat on the main level in wooden church pews and loved the atmosphere with the bar and hanging lights. And most importantly our food was delicious! They had a ton of vegetarian and vegan options, which we always appreciate. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty, it's been a long time. A few friends introduced me to it way back in my freshmen year of college and I don't remember it being memorable. Being that it's been a while, I decided to try it again with a friend who loves it. It is a loud, dark restaurant with the window shades down and minimal lighting, so we opted to sit outside since it was a nice day. Plenty of seating available and our server came out within a few minutes with some menus and our drink orders. I got the veggie chicken tikka masala pasty from their wonderful vegetarian section and my friend ordered the chicken Greek, her favorite. I was pleasantly surprised with my pasty, I loved the Indian spices and the flavors worked together well. The portion size was just enough that I was able to finish it and be full. They use Quorn for their veggie chicken and it's got a weird texture but mixed with other ingredients in a pasty, it works.   Lots to choose from here, veggie and meat lovers alike. There's locations in Mesa and Scottsdale as well, with one set to open in Downtown Phoenix sometime. Check them out! You're bound to find something you like."}
{"text":"I used to work in downtown Phoenix and this place was slated to open for a long time. I'm glad it's here and I got to visit for dinner this weekend.   It's an interesting setup; they've got some outdoor seating and you walk in to what seems like a small space. However, they have a basement as well as a second floor, both set up lounge style. They really took a creative spin and I thought it was great. The hostess greeted us and gave us the rundown: we seat ourselves and the server comes by with menus. We chose to sit downstairs and I loved all the booths and private spaces. It was dark in typical CP style but didn't detract.   My friend and I ordered waters and their oven chips as an appetizer. Delicious! They came with complimentary jalapeños and garlic topping and the potatoes were crispy and flavorful with no hint of greasiness. My first choice of pasty was unavailable unfortunately so I went with one I've tried before, the veggie chicken tikka masala. My friend got the veggie Mexican. My order came out wrong and I received the veggie cottage pie instead, and I decided to take it instead of waiting longer for my original order. We split our pasties and I liked the Mexican but not the cottage so much. However, our server was apologetic about the order mixup and didn't charge us for the second pasty.   I do love the buttery flaky crust (props if you get my reference haha) and I learned that the crimped edges means those are the vegetarian pasties. Way cool! Despite the snafu, I will come back to CP. This is a neat location to check out in downtown Phoenix, walking distance from other entertainment venues."}
{"text":"Great place right in the Arts District.  The pasties are delicious and the service was excellent as well!  Nice selection of pasties. Traditional as well as some creative additions.  Ambiance is awesome and casual with no slots lol.  Good bat selection as well.  Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Kinda low key in the Commercial Center. Easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for. Small divey pub with a bar and church pews for seating!   They have tons of variety in the pasties (past ease), whether you're looking for meat, fish, or veg. A nice touch I like is they have an individualized sauce for each pasty. My personal favorite is the Royale with Cheese with the Thousand Island dressing. It's like having a whole Big Mac meal, fries and all, wrapped up in a convenient meat pie. Appetizers are tasty here too. You gotta try the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake, and the oven chips with garlic and jalapeño.  Lastly, the desserts. A few options here, including strawberry pavlova, pb&j pasty, and caramel apple pasty. The showstopper is the STP aka Shirley Temple Pudding aka Sticky Toffee Pudding. It comes in a little black cauldron, with the toffee bubbling in top. I get mine with a scoop of ice cream. A bite of the gooey warm buttery pudding with the cold ice cream :p"}
{"text":"Sarah was an awesome bartender and knowledgeable server. Customized our drinks perfectly.  The best!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this, and today, I got my chance to try out the Cornish Pasty Company.   I will tell you now, this is a place for a true foodie. This is a dark restaurant, one that puts you in the kitchen. Literally. If you find yourself disturbed by seeing real kitchen professionals running around, then avoid this place.   Walking in, I felt like I was going into a dive bar. All of the kitchen staff is motley, and I loved it. We took two seats at the bar, and were greeted by an awesome server. She got us Guinness (poured perfectly, that gets a star), and we got to check out the menu.  Vast, is a good phrase for this menu. If you haven't had a Pasty before, I like to think of it as a Hot Pocket that doesn't make you want to die.  I got the Cottage Pie Pasty, and my friend got the Italian Pasty.   Our pasties were served on very distinct metal plates, with a sauce side. I had a red wine gravy, which was incredible. Tart and not thick at all. It was excellent. My friend had a marinara, he replied that it had a nice spice to it.  The food was excellent. My Pasty was filled with ground beef, potatoes, peas ,carrots, and cheese.  Warm, gooey, and it felt good being in there.  That is what I would say is the key to this place. You have to love it. You have to love feeling of the warmth every time the oven is opened, along with the following scent of roasted herbs and spices. The staff, rushing around, looking more like roadies than cooking professionals.  This place is real. It's alive. And it's good. Check out the menu, and go there. I will be going as much as possible."}
{"text":"One if my favorite restaurants in town for a fee reasons. The food is craaaazy good and unique. I dont know of anywhere else you can find this type of food. It really changes it up from the monotonous hamburger, pizza or tacos I usually eat. Second, and very importantly, the service has always been phenomenal. The staff is so friendly. Particularly, Shonn, who was totally down to earth, informative and clearly a hard worker. Our previous visit was with another waiter who had a beard and kind looked like Shonns twin and he was super helpful and nice too even though it was very busy. The ambiance is very relaxed and trendy. I like how dark it is and i dig the music selection. This is a must visit yall!!!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this this place.  Finally got to try it and it lived up to my expectations.  Went traditional pub and ordered Sheppard's pie.  It was Delicious and savoury.  A wide a selection of beer for a relatively short list.  Very friendly staff for for very casual dinning."}
{"text":"It's good, not amazing, but good, and would try it again. The pasties are hearty and filling, but out of all of the choices, there really wasn't one that sounded that great to me. Got the cheese and onion, and it was good. Mashed potatoes were good too. The atmosphere is good, and a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Grew up on Pasty's as a holiday food treat for most of my childhood. Move up to Phoenix and realize there is a really cool place that makes delicious pasty's, serves a gazillion good beers and has a chill vibe? Sign me up! Oggie pasty is old faithful, love the filling and the gravy that accompanies it. Had many others and haven't been disappointed. I would like to try some of the more exotic models butttttt that og pasty is just so. damn. good. I really like the inside decor and furnishings, music can be uh... eclectic, which adds to the cool vibe. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Updated review for the new location.   Same awesome food, same reasonable prices, same great service. Ambiance still comfortable and mostly unpretentious -- the new building is much bigger, with pool tables and much more seating, plus bonus high ceilings with exposed ductwork for extra hipster cred.   The only downside is the parking. I was a HUGE fan of the old location in the unpretentious, crummy-fabulous Commerical Center; this new spot is a slight bitch if you're driving a car. There is street parking in the Arts District, which depending on day/time might be free....and there's a big free lot across Charleston, by the Arts Factory. But you can't just park out front and walk in, like at the old place. (Tip: there is a back entrance, so if you do park in the Arts district, you can come in thru the rear alley instead of walking all the way around the block to the front.) Also, there is no bike rack...but we locked our bikes to the iron railing next door, which seemed to be OK.  But the parking inconveniences are made up for by the improved people-watching: big plate-glass windows up front offer a primo view of the crazy pedestrian traffic on Charleston.   I have probably tried 75% of the menu so far, and it has all been excellent! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I have to say this one of the tastiest places I have eaten. Not only is it authentically British, but the air in the place resembles exactly that of a pub. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly staff. Great music. I will be coming back without a doubt.  The price is great and the food is filling. Some authentic British selections without a doubt. Shepherd's Pie Pasty is the bee's knees. The British oven fries with cheese is a great starter. Looking forward to happy hour next time."}
{"text":"I grew up eating pasties in the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan so I was happy to see a place that had them on my recent trip to the Phoenix area. The reviews were really good so we came by to check it out.  Food wise, the pasties were pretty good but smaller than what I was used to in the UP. We tried a few different ones and some we liked better than others.   They do have a decent beer list here.  As for the place itself, it was really dark inside and did not seem very clean. Black ceiling, black shades, low lighting. Also, the service was slow. I had ordered a beer and watched it sit up on the bar counter for a while before the server eventually brought it over. Same thing for the 2nd beer, there it sat and a different person eventually brought it over.  I liked the food Ok, but probably wouldn't come back if in the area again. Too bad the place isn't a bit nicer inside."}
{"text":"Whoever said that British food was gross and bland has never tried this place. The owner Dean is an amazing person with a passion for his food and it shows in everything that is served. The best Guinness in Arizona to go with a filling Oggie, the traditional pasty. I found this gem while at ASU and make a stop there every time I'm in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem . The pasties they serve are top notch, filling and yummy"}
{"text":"Is it damning with faint praise to  say it's the best restaurant of its type when there's no analog within the city?      Until now  most of my experience with the pasties, or bridies as we called a  very similar dish In Scotland, has been uniformly  bad in the USA.  E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.  This was so much better than I had hoped.  That they had draft cider too was  even better , a rarity in AZ, but perfect sense given the origin of the pasty in the English  West Country. Should have been Scrumpy ,a man can dream can't he?   The complaints about them not being traditional fillings is , well, odd. There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is true.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering.   Onto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.     Fillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good.   So why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Literally every item was delicious. The Cajun chicken is probably the best. Devin, our waiter, was AMAZING. So AMAZING, we went back the next day for more. So sad they don't have this is TX. Considering taking another trip to AZ just for the tasty pasty. Sweet sweet pasty. LORT."}
{"text":"I came here with some fiends because they really love this place and raved how good their pasty is. I was blown away how AMAZING they are. They have so much variety of pasties and also had a full page of VEGAN/ VEGETARIAN options for me. It is so hard to find a place with delicious, no scratch that, highly delightful to the taste buds place like this. I am going here again this weekend and trying me another delicious package of phenomenon. I love you Cornish Pasty. Please be my cicisbeo."}
{"text":"Wow - not to pile on someone else's review but this place is a \"hidden gem\"!  And one of my customers told me that here's a few of these places around Phoenix??  Is this true?    Anyway, the only complaint I have isn't really a complaint at all - it's more like. Nice surprise.   So, they actually have quite bit more of a food offering outside of the menu that's displayed on Yelp.  Not sure if that's a \"Yelp\" issue or maybe a technical upload mishap from the establishment but...and again, this is MOT and issue, but they have a whole slew of additional appetizer options as well - like this sick delicious curry bean dip - amazing.  Sort of like beans meet curry meet humus - yum!    I went with the Oggie, since in a Michigan native.  And, having eaten my fill of pasties (trust me, I've eaten a LOT of pasties), I consider myself an expert. These pasties in my humble opinion are as good as my sisters' - just don't tell her I said that.   Like many others on here, they're correct. The atmosphere is great - service is more than excellent and he food just rocks.  If you don't like this place - I really don't know what else to tell you.  Even their \"vegan\" pasties are good.  Although I'm bett'en there's still lard in the pie crust... :D. So there you Vegans!!!  Na na na. Just kidding.   Enjoy - it's a 5 plus-plus fo-Shizzel."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in tempe!   MUST TRIES!! - Italian Cornish Pasty (new:) ) - chocolate bread budding   This is literally one of the best restaurants i have ever been to and it is so cute and small and the staff is sooooo friendly. Please try this place, i guarantee you will love it!!"}
{"text":"Great, unique food and a nice selection of beers.  There isn't much more I'd ask from a restaurant.  The ambiance is very casual and dark but it's a great place for a large group or even solo dining.  The menu is fantastic and makes you want to come back again just to try another pasty.  With a dough wrapped meat/cheese/veggie mix you'd think this would be very heavy but it isn't.  They don't overload with fats or cheeses so the meal remains balanced and tasty.  Happy hour M-Sat until 6 just adds another reason to stop by."}
{"text":"i swear i wrote a review for this place before...anyways, here goes again.  Great beer, great food.  If you never had a cornish pasty before well you are missing out on a lot. The chefs here put a lot of thought into each pasty because the flavors really compliment each other and the crust is nice and flaky (how i prefer).   This place is a pure dive bar... if locals scare you...don't go around here because that is all you are going to get.   Thinking about cornish pasty co. is making me hungry. i am going to have to stop by sometime this upcoming week to meet this craving now...thanks yelp..."}
{"text":"The first time I ever had a pasty was in Michigan when I was 10 years old. My grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven. When Cornish Pasty Co. announced they were going to open in Tempe back in 2005, I was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite.   Since 2005, I've tried many different pasties and still can't decide which my favorite is. The Oggie is a good standard- it's what my memory from Michigan tastes like only better. The Pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with Turkey. Honestly, my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies. I don't care what is inside, as long as that crust is flakey and warm. Mmm... One time I ordered a small Greek Salad and now I have to order it every time I'm there. The dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so, so good... the only down side is that I'm still tasting it hours later. It's that strong! To finish up, you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with crème angelias AND ice cream. The bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, which I love. The husband isn't too crazy about it (\"bread pudding shouldn't be crunchy!\"), but that means more for me!  They have happy hour starting at 3pm, which includes drink specials. I've only ordered a Gin and Tonic here and as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn good. One time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some, just so I could have my drink. I felt pretty special that night.  We have been to the location in Mesa and the patio is really nice, but the original restaurant has rustic charm. Whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth, you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner. It's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance.   Anytime we are in Tempe, this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends. If you are ever in the area, definitely stop in!!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO GET: The meatball appetizer! They come in a cup with glazed onions, yummy sauce and croutons at the bottom. The hibiscus tea is refreshing too. Fiance got the meat and cheese and loved it. We didn't bring any leftovers home!  I Wouldn't recommend the Rosemary Chicken. Can't really taste the rosemary and its honestly not very flavorful.   Atmosphere is really cool and eclectic and has a great vibe to it. Our server was very attentive and service was great. Go check it out."}
{"text":"If you have never tried a \"pasty,\" it is addictive comfort/bar food if done well. These guys DO IT WELL!!!!   This is a fun little pub, with an awesome selection of beer on tap and otherwise, great decor and friendly staff... A perfect neighborhood bar to meet friends for some cheer! I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner! No wonder it's a Best of Vegas choice! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Any other Yoopers out there looking for a pasty? Cornish won't disappoint! The neighborhood is sketchy and the restaurant is a little run down. Actually, really run down- you should probably just take out haha. They have SO many types of pasties! My three favorites have been the 1. Bangers and Mash 2. The Oggie 3. Porky - in that order.  The basic pasty is made of meat and potatoes in a flaky delicious crust. They have a bunch of different fancier versions of that on their menu. Pasties are a bit messy, but they're a great to go snack!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place. I stopped by about 2pm. The windows face north, and its dark inside, with the glare from the front. The menu was hard to read in the dark. They do have many options, which is great, but also made it difficult to decide. I went with the Cajun chicken and maybe it's just me, but I was disappointed. For me, it's a huge serving, so I barely got through half. I took the other half to go. I got home, put it in the fridge and well, forgot about it. I will go back to try a more traditional version. What would make me really happy is to see a sampler plate with mini versions. I understand they cannot be customized, that's ok. Service was a bit slow and not overly personal. I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"Weird dining experience. Delicious food and really cool bar, but it's really dark and kinda dingy looking inside. Vegan and vegetarian friendly - tons of options for many diets. Can't wait to go back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"So amazing. Almost every Pasty i've ordered here was absolutely delicious.   I went with one I've never seen on the menu, as I was visiting since I've moved. I got the Royale With Cheese. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a glutenous treat.  The only thing I would change is: Knowing your server knows about you, make it not as dark and if you should seat yourself."}
{"text":"We were downtown and decided on a whim to have dinner here. I must say my first time having a pasty did not disappoint me! The only bad part was ordering the Cornish Meatballs for an appetizer and not being told they were out of them until after the rest of our food was brought to the table and we asked about them. I'll definitely be back for more pasties!"}
{"text":"A fantastic addition to Commercial Center!  Cool reclaimed church pews, great selection of draught beers and delicious food!  We shared the traditional Oggie, filled with tender steak and potatoes with a side of wine gravy.  My GF had the half salmon salad - the salmon was fantastic!  I had the sausage salad - it is huge!  Tons of sage sausage with crispy romaine, roasted red peppers, feta, served with a yummy mustard cream dressing. I read that their sticky toffee pudding rivaled Gorden Ramsay's.  I can compare them but I and tell you that Cornish Pasty's is delicious.  Served in a lava hot pot ( I know I touched it - I never listen), it is bubbling with a delicious caramel sauce.  The cold vanilla ice cream is a perfect partner.  I can't wait to try the other pasties!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch.  Saw a article in the Las Vegas paper.  I had the Oggie (traditional for me of course) and my wife had the Bangers and Mash.  Both were excellent.  I am a genuine Yooper having eaten my first pasty over 60 years ago.  The Oggie was better than many of the ones found at roadside Finnish Pasty shops in Da UP (Upper Peninsula of Michigan) and on par with some of the homemade ones I've had.  Next time I might try something different because they have a huge variety."}
{"text":"My only experience with Cornish Pasty Co. stems from dining at their Mesa location last summer. Despite a few service quips, I was pretty impressed. This particular location, situated on Monroe Street, is a bit different in setup, but still excellent in regards to food quality.  First off, be aware that you'll need to seat yourself. Mesa's Cornish location has a hostess. This might result in some confusion. There are three levels, but I've only eaten in the basement by choice. The area is filled with multiple leather/mobster booths and a seedy \"dive\" feel. Ideally, it's where I would hang out if I wanted to hide from the rest of the world and just eat pasties and play board games all night.  It's really hard to recommend pasties here, because everything we've ordered is excellent quality. It really boils down to personal preference. I've never been a big meat/potatoes guy, so I'm more drawn to their Italian-styled pasties, while my girlfriend always defaults to their Pilgrim due to her love of traditional Thanksgiving food. There are no disappointments to be found here, which is the result of ingredients that are solid quality and a shortcrust that packs flavor and fluffy texture.  For dessert, despite the constant Yelp recommendations for the banoffee pie, we struggle at passing up their chocolate bread and butter pudding. The booze inclusion is subtle and satisfying. It's warm interior with a crispy outer-shell just makes it irresistible, but eventually we'll cave and try something else.  Cool environment, great food, and reasonable prices for what you receive. How can you not Cornish give it a strong recommendation?"}
{"text":"I finally got to try CPC before an ASU football game last weekend.  When we walked in there were a few other confused looking people crowded in the doorway. We were there about 15 minutes to 6 and apparently there isn't a hostess until 6. So along with the other people we fended for ourselves and my hubby and I found a table for 2. Usually dark and small places make me claustrophobic but I actually liked the atmosphere. It was like a comfy cave. And I loved the fact that I smelled curry in a pub.   It took about 10 minutes to get any service. Which slightly annoyed me because if we would have gotten served earlier we would have gotten happy hour prices on our beers. But luckily the server was great. Really sweet, funny, and informative.   The pasties do take awhile to be made, but that's okay because we had 32 oz beers to enjoy! They have a good, but not huge beer selection.  My husband ordered the oggie which he really enjoyed. He loved the sauce it came with. I ordered the pesto veggie pasty. It was very tasty. The pasty itself it so buttery and flaky. And the filling had Quorn brand veggie chicken which is my favorite brand of vegetarian chicken. So yummy. Next time I definitely want to order a spicier one. Italian style was good but I can imagine a Mexican or Indian one being even better!  Overall, worth the 20 minute trek to Tempe!"}
{"text":"I was eagerly anticipating this opening as I work right around the block and love Cornish Pasty Co. It seemed like they took forever to open but they finally did and I was psyched!  I avoided going there for the first few weeks as I heard it was a bit crazy and unorganized. I have been there twice for lunch and once for early dinner/happy hour.  The food is pretty much the same, delicious as always. My favorite is still the veggie chicken tikka pasty. The service is very chill and friendly, just like the other locations.  The atmosphere is very special. It is an old, historic building and has three very cool levels and a nice patio for people watching. The basement is my favorite. It reminds me of a speakeasy.  My only complaint is they do not have a happy hour. We went there thinking there would be and we were disappointed to be informed they don't have one \"yet\". They need to work on their happy hour game! Us downtown workers love to get our drink on and we love our happy hour so hop to it Cornish Pasty Company!"}
{"text":"Cornish pasty has a real gritty restaurant ambiance that surprisingly works great. long tables with what feels like church pews for seats, cement brick like walls. My favorite part is when walking in the glass case displaying all the Chefs hard at work creating the pasty's. There is a a bar in the back of the restaurant with pool tables for those who are over 21.   Their menu has a vast selection of pub style food including Indian dishes. I was looking forward to trying the leek soup and shepherds pie pasty but to my dismay cheese is already in everything. They did offer to call in 24 hours in advance to request menu items with no cheese, however I don't know if I will be doing that. Their dessert PB and J Pasty was to die for."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co. is a really fascinating little restaurant off the strip.  It's not advised to come here just via taxi (as getting a taxi back is a toughie) but if you can make it out and want some unique pastry entree food, it's highly recommended.    So the pasty, which I learned, was like a better quality hot pocket (I know - bad analogy - I'm sorry!).  They have tons of different kinds from different meats, sauces, and inspirations from vegan to meats to ethnic types.  My friends, for instance, got the chicken alfredo while another went Greek.  I went Indian with the chicken masala pasty.  It was solidly delicious with flavors that really tasted like I was eating a chicken masala dish inside this pastry with the yogurt sauce.  Price-wise, it came out to about $12+.  They also had some small side dishes and dessert although we didn't pick them up this time around.    Their beer list is also amazing.  From the weird to the solid, they had a quality list.  I had the ginger beer which was terrific (they even had a banana bread beer which I'll try out the next time).    Decor-wise, they were definitely going for the British pub vibe which it gets down pretty well.  Don't be too fooled by the old-looking exterior which just seems more reflective of the strip mall that it's in.  Staff was very friendly as well and parking is plentiful if you have a car.    I don't think the food will completely floor those looking for a fancy dinner or a very experimental dish.  However, for those looking for something affordable and different should give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Don't let the building fool you. Such awesome food! I had the salmon pasty which is pretty much a pastry and sandwich put together. The service was great and attentive. The atmosphere is definitely comfortable and casual. For dessert we had a banana dessert which tasted almost like a boston cream pie."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, a lot of food for the price. The place was pretty cool to look at. I ordered the chicken pot pie it was tasty. I would go again, they had a bunch of different things on the menu if your adventurous with your food."}
{"text":"Seriously everything is delicious! Irish Car Bombs are kind of part of the experience, so get used to it."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid when you walk into the dimly lit space that mimics the feel of being in a coal mine.  Cornish Pasty Co offers up a wide variety of pasties that are very good.  I think this my new spot for lunch on my way to the airport.    Good beer too."}
{"text":"This is normally a five star place, so I hate to rate it any lower but the service we received from one particular waitress was sad. I've been happily bringing people to Cornish since they were at their old location but I was embarrassed to have brought my family the day this girl was working. I didn't catch her name but she was shorter, blonde-ish, had ripped-style clothes on, and made us feel like we were an inconvenience. Party of five came in on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm. I understand just because there may not be many people does not mean there aren't a lot of things to do, but our waitress was careless and had a passive attitude. She took forever to take our initial drink orders and did not come back to check if we wanted refills. I'm a thirsty bitch and usually have 2-3 beers, so she missed a sale.  The food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious, as always. Not once while we were eating did she check in despite servicing her other tables, and as we finished she did not clear any plates away.  When we paid, we gave her cash and asked her to split the remaining balance evenly between two cards. She hastily gave us a pen and told us to write the amounts we wanted charged because she didn't remember what we ordered then walked away.  Buzzkill for the meal. I'm not trying to be a whiny asshole but I've worked in service and my family who was with me that day still do. This wasn't a life or death situation, and it may not seem like a big deal, but I feel like this type of half-assed service can really do damage and should be avoided."}
{"text":"Although the pork pasty and mushroom+ soup were delish, the Indian spiced chicken salad was lacking.  Fast service but the loud planes, irritating patio music, along with the bothersome flies, had us scurrying along.  This was not our first time at The Cornish Pasty.  We now prefer the Guadalupe location.  Homemade soups, brews, and pasties are quite good."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time the other night and we were not overly impressed. The ambiance is that of a Dark/Gothic dungeon, very dark and kind of all over the place as far as arrangement of tables. They were decently busy for a Tuesday night (Hey some people like that theme, just not for us). Music playing in background, most of which seemed like death metal.. not really for us, made it seem less of a pub feel. Restrooms were stocked and decently clean as a positive. Okay so the Food... we had 2 different Pasty's the Cajun Chicken and the Indian Curry($11 each). Both were good! No complaints there, not amazing but definitely good! It is almost like a baked stuffed pie, that is mostly what is on the menu for food other then a few appetizers. The $4 irish car bombs were cool, 1/2 pour of typical irish car bomb but hey its $4. The beers were unique and different ones available in different sizes. Mostly European beers, which makes it rather expensive, a few $6 beers, most were $8-13. Spent $60 after a few beers and 2 Pasty's. This place is an acquired taste I would say, probably won't return."}
{"text":"Love this place! I ordered lamb n mint pasty covered in red wine sauce.. Meat was well done. Got the indian flavors bursting in my mouth with my first bite. Also tried the chicken tikka masala and it is uber delicious ... must try for all food lovers !!!"}
{"text":"My husband had tried the food at the Arizona location and loved it so we had to try it in Las Vegas too.   My husband and cousin had some hard ciders that they loved.  We shared an order of garlic mashed potatoes with cheese that were very tasty.  We each tried a different pasty. My husband had the Royale with Cheese. It was meaty and delicious.  I had the Chicken Pesto which had great mushrooms and artichokes in it.  My cousin and his girlfriend had two different pasties which they loved.  The food was great. The ambiance was amazing and the server was superb.   We had a great time and I plan to go back for my birthday in a few months!"}
{"text":"After dropping off family on the strip after a day out, we were quite peckish and stopped in on a Sunday evening. We've heard of the place and wanted to give it a try since it moved to Charleston Blvd. It wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away, in these amazing pews salvaged from a church in Philly. Right off the bat, I found 3 or four pasty's I wanted to try, the first being the Peppered Steak. Sadly, our server for the night, Sean, came right off and gave us a list of 4 of the sold out pasty's, that being one of them. He said first Friday weekend wiped them out ( excellent! ) I opted for  The Guinness Stew Pasty. My husband chose the Full English Breakfast Pasty and a pot of tea. I had the German Pilsner from Japan - a suggestion again from Sean. I am a Stella drinker and he said I would like this one, and again, I did! I was not bothered by the wait, I know that these pasty's need to be in the oven for a certain amount of time and I understand the process.We were able to enjoy the care put into the restaurant decor, subtle industrial / public house. The smells coming from the open kitchen area were amazing. Patience is a virtue. When we finally got our meals, the wait was worth it. I mean really, what is 10 to 15 minutes out of your life, especially when you are spending it with family and friends? The tastes of the stew were spectacular. The meats were tender the veg inside melded perfectly. The Full English actually had an egg that oozed yoke.. I have no idea how they did it. The chips with garlic were enough to split and we also shared a sticky toffee pudding with a delicious bowl of vanilla ice cream.. that sucker is HOT when it is delivered to your table.. so give it a minute love..the roof of your mouth will thank you. We are delighted to say we cant wait to go back! They not only have a full bar, they have a pool table and darts!  And THANK YOU for calling it just a CAR BOMB. No need to be rude and call it something else!"}
{"text":"I've never had a pasty that wasn't delicious here.  The Carne Adovada is particularly good!  Great food and a good selection of craft beers.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! This place is three floors of amazingness. Downstairs is a dark and gloomy seductive pub the middle floor is open air and upstairs is a great pool area. I love this location so much more than the Tempe one, all sorts of fun and the same great food! You have to check it out and make sure you get a pasty they are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever had British food before but if pasties are a good representation of British food, I'm a huge fan!  My boyfriend and I came here day after our half marathon run right.  We were looking for something tasty and different to try in Arizona before we headed back to San Fran.  Based on the reviews, we picked this place and didn't regret it one bit.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala which was perfectly cooked.  Don't know how they do it but everything was perfectly seasoned, the chicken was very tender, and the potatoes perfectly cooked.  Great meal in a pocket, my favorite kind of easy to eat fair.   My boyfriend was disappointed that they ran out of the peppered steak.  His frown was turned upside down soon enough after he had first few bites of his back-up order, Rosemary steak.  I had a bite and it was definitely was really well seasoned, beef was tender, and the flavor combination was great!  Thank goodness I planned ahead for dessert.  I only finished half of mine so I could have room for their chocolate bread and butter pudding which did not disappoint.  We had it with creme anglaise and it was a delicious decadent chocolate goodness.  Be warned, the chocolate brandy is very strong in this one.  On the service side, it wasn't a busy day and our waiter was super nice, attentive, and the food came at a reasonable time for it to be freshly made to order.   Overall a great experience, and I'll definitely come back to try a few other pasties."}
{"text":"If you have never been inside of a British Pub atmosphere before, prepare to be AMAZED (dimly lit, great music, chill/ friendly staff).  The Cornish Pasty Company is offers over 50 different Pasties! I came in on a late Thursday night near closing time and there were still a good amount of people inside. They didn't seem irritated that we came near closing time either, but instead, they were very welcoming and accommodating.   My recommendations: Do yourself a favor and get the bashers and mash and shepherds pie! The crust of the pasties were so PERFECT. Beautifully flacky and not soggy even though inside of the pasty was filled with steaming potatoes and meat.   DON'T skimp out on the desserts either!! Their caramel apple crumble pasty was AMAZING. Just like the pasties for the shepherds pie or the bashers and mash, the apple crumb was encased in the lovely pasty crust. It not overly sweet like many other desserts even though it was drenched with warm caramel on top. I don't typically get desserts but I was just feeling it on this day. This dessert did not let me down was the best way to end the meal."}
{"text":"You won't find better flavor profiles at any 5 star restaurants on the Strip. The food here is absolutely ON POINT!  Light, flaky pie crust and incredibly delicious fillings all baked to order. I'm going to be dreaming about this place for quite a while. AND it's right across the parking lot from Lotus of Siam and next door to Komol...crazy to think that you can get such high quality food in an old run down strip mall in Vegas. DO NOT SLEEP ON Cornish Pasty Co."}
{"text":"Good variety of pasties and drink. A bit small, so not much elbow room. One of my favorite places in Tempe for lunch. Pretty noisy and packed later in the evenings.  A good change of pace if you are looking for something out of the ordinary for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best English foods I have ever had. Their pasties definitely pack in the flavors, not very well known for English food. I would highly recommend The Royal with Cheese. It's sort of their twist of a hamburger and fries stuffed in a calzone. The servers are very friendly and welcoming. Give this place a try, you are in for a pleasant surprise :)  The only issue I have is how long it take to make one once you have ordered. I would suggest to call ahead and order before eating there. I can understand the high price for just one pasty (around $9 per pastey not including a side) because they make each one by hand with fresh ingredients. The restaurant can work on the interior design as its a bit confusing, a mix between modern and old style English pub. Not a big fan of the church pews for seats because its hard to sit upright while eating. Its just awkward. If you can look past the odd decor, this place in not at all that bad."}
{"text":"English restaurant/pub located in the arts district of downtown Las Vegas.  The restaurant is decorated very uniquely with old and modern touches. Some of the seats are actually church pews.  The menu has a variety of stuffed pastries, traditional like bangers and mash to Italian variations like meatball. I had the meat and cheese which was beef with Swiss and other cheese. It was delicious. The pastry itself was fresh and tasty.  Reasonably priced and good service."}
{"text":"Flaky tender pastry, neat atmosphere, and Scottish beer. This place is tops!  We enjoyed an order of oven chips (fries) with garlic and jalapeño on them; a peppered steak pasty (about $9.00) (you have to likeStilton blue cheese to like this one ) I loved it; and a crisp Crabbies Ginger Beer from Scotland ($6.50).  5/5 will be back."}
{"text":"I base my knowledge on pasty's on this establishment and what I've learned is, THEY'RE DAMN GOOD! I love the crust and the variety of fillings Cornish offers. There is a pasty for everyone. Whether you're a meat lover, vegetarian, or vegan, they have something for you. Oven chips (French Fries) is pretty awesome but my favorite side is the Broccoli and Cauliflower Bake, its delicious! I also LOVE the Shirley Temple Pudding. The beer selection is pretty good and they also serve wine. One of my favorite parts is being able to pick up a par'done pasty and finish baking it in the comfort of your own home. All in all I'm definitely a fan. I recently introduced my coworkers and they all enjoyed the food as well."}
{"text":"I love this place and I come as often as I can and always bring new people with me to show them this cool spot! I am super bummed though that they took the Rosemary steak off the menu! It's my favorite and I come across town for it sometimes! This is my request to bring back the beloved Rosemary steak!!!!"}
{"text":"Almost dive bar type British style pasty bar.. There are numerous pasties to choose from, even about 10 vegetarian / vegan ones. (It's paw-ste?... not p?-stee )  There is a rotating tap list, with a great variety & a few local beers.... Along with a bottle list that changes every-so often.  Odd music playlist but the service & company make up for any weirdness.  The pasties are great. I had the Oggie... Just short of amazing! I was disappointed with the mushy peas, though.  Over all a great place for dinner and a drink & to just hang out."}
{"text":"This place wasn't originally on our itinerary, but I'm incredibly glad we ended up here. Delicious food, relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, and decent prices. If you live here, you should come. If you're visiting, you ought to try it."}
{"text":"Went to the Dobson and Baseline location first tonight and left within 5 mins....dirty menus, dirty table, not comfortable staying....drove over to this location unwilling to give up.  Had a great experience.  Good food, good service, fun pub atmosphere with great grinding music.  Took leftovers, two pasties home along with dessert.  Yum."}
{"text":"The Pasty is in the corner of a pretty nondescript strip mall, and was tricky to locate the first time, but I am so glad that the Cornish Pasty and I found each other. I love coming here with friends for a great beer and a pasty! The decor is a mix of traditional pub fittings and industrial touches, and there's a pretty hip soundtrack on to match. The atmosphere and the servers are casual, but I can't say that I've had bad service here before. The pasties are fresh and flaky (note: they can take time to bake up!); the bread pudding took me to heaven: warm, chocolatey and oh so rich! I also recommend the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake."}
{"text":"Although I've only been here once, I do plan on returning when I find time. I found this little hot spot to be very appetizing. Its a great atmosphere, amazing food, and the service is fairly speedy... and attractive :)   will write more when i return for seconds!"}
{"text":"3 floors and outdoor seating to this pasty specialty and tap beer restaurant/bar. Bartender Sean took such good care of us. He recommended beers and even split a huge Shepherds pasty, one half for now and the other half  to-go for later. Very satisfying and filling. Beautiful Phoenix night. Fun and yummy food. They also have wings, greek spinach snacks and other tasty appetizers. Desserts, too."}
{"text":"Traveling through and found this place; wish we lived here so we could go all the time. Great drink menu, dark ambiance (as many Irish pubs are), great, friendly service and amazing food. We let our waitress pick our appetizer (Scotch eggs) and our meals. She brought 2 pasty's cut  in half so we could share. Mine had turkey and sweet potatoes and my husband had beef with blue cheese (many other things inside too but these are the identifying characteristics). Scrumptious is the best word for all of it.  Everything on the menu sounded like.something we would want. We couldn't decide and that's why we let the waitress pick. She couldn't go wrong. And... Everything was so reasonably priced.   This has inspired us to look for a good similar pub at home. This is a must visit place."}
{"text":"These weren't the \"pasties\" I was thinking of...  Joking, obviously.   I was here to celebrate a friend's birthday. They told us 20 people would fit at one of the long tables. Uh, no. Not unless we all sat shoulder-to-shoulder with our arms squeezed under the table. Oh well, all 20 people weren't there at the same time, and a few people stood, so the 14ish people that were sitting, were comfortable. But, being a looooooong bench at a table, it was kind of a pain when the person in the middle wanted to get out of their seat.  The pasty I had (some southwesternish thing, I think) was okay. I've never had a pasty before and if I ever return (which I have no objection to), I will order something different. The drink menu listed cider on tap. They didn't have any. I don't know if it was just that night, or permanently, but I was sad. Our server was great, though. For a busy night, he was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Walking back from a business meeting we stumbled by this restaurant which was close to our hotel.    Walked in and went up stairs to get seats.  Walked up the stairs and saw they got billards on the second floor.  Pretty nifty.    Ordered \"The Oggy\", which was a crispy tasty pastry stuffed with sliced potatoes, chopped steak, and sauce on the side. Also, I ordered a Guinness to accompany the oggy pastry as well. Delish!  Btw , they got a few selection of IPA for those that are IPA drinkers."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and I always take people here. Usually has a good crowd and sometimes can be difficult to find a table. Good prices and drinks."}
{"text":"Everyone in the family loves this place. Who wouldn't love anything, from almost any cuisine, in a hand-held pie?  My favorites are the chicken and rosemary, vindaloo and chicken tikka masala.  The food is brilliant, drink selection is great, atmosphere is dark-n-divey and the staff is great.  (We had one unfortunate experience with a trainee at the Gilbert location, but otherwise, always great at the Tempe one.)    My husband and I went on our first date here, so it's also our anniversary spot."}
{"text":"FOOD: I don't know why Cornish Pasty is listed as British food. Most of the choices of pasties are not British at all. For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry.   PRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch.   SERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly.   ATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either. Maybe if it was the Sex Pistols...  SKINNY: Cornish Pasty is great lunch spot at best, but doesn't offer anything that will blow your socks off. Interesting food with decent taste. I'll probably be going back."}
{"text":"Yes, the pasty's are lovely and filling and also lovely. BUT to my surprise earlier today when I asked, mostly in jest, what was for dessert, Dylan (legendary server) told me I needed to have the Banoffee Pie. What? Banoffee? What? Never heard of it, but after hittin' it pretty hard, never gonna forget it. Wow. Easily the best dessert I've ever had and I've had 'em all.  Homemade; toffee, caramel, whipped cream, measured banana slices, mashed up against a memorable graham crust....annnnd scene. I'll be back for more of the Banoffee and for another pasty and a Guinness or three. See you there."}
{"text":"Cornish pasty is so bomb. When I'm in Phoenix, we usually end up here at some point throughout the night for pasties and drinks. I've tried like 3 or 4 different ones and have not been disappointed yet. There are three floors in this bar, which is crazy to me living in the bay. But it's really cool and guarantees you can get a drink quickly and strongly at any of the three floors. Downstairs is my favorite, if I'm being honest- it's probably the best floor to end your night at. Upstairs is for the start of the night, before getting TOO lit. I'm going back to phoenix in about a month and I'm drooling right now as I type this thinking about the Philly cheesesteak pasty I'm ordering as soon as we hit Cornish Pasty"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch. Although it seemed a bit busy we were allowed to chose our own seating. 71F in Phoenix, you bet were sittings outside on their cool little patio. I ordered the Reuben. Nice and fluffy crust with all the fittings you'd expect in a Reuben. I loved my food. My friend complained that it was too hot and burned his mouth a couple of times  The real bummer moment for me was when I finished my food. I found a rather large piece of hair underneath my pastry. I let my waitress know and man was she embarrassed (it wasn't her hair). They were cool enough to take care of me and apologized many times. I get it, shit happens. But it's always the cool ones who actually do something about it and not just shrug to shit happening. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great food, but the atmosphere is a bit dingy and the servers aren't that friendly."}
{"text":"Many people have commented about the location of Cornish, but don't let that stop you. Each time I have gone it has been late afternoon, early evening. But having lived in Las Vegas for many years I remember being in that area at all hours of the day and night (Anyone remember Mary K arcade) and never had any issues  This was my second time to Cornish Pasty Co. Both time I came with family and kids. The youngest being 15 months old. Each time we were able to find a table with ease and the staff was very attentive and helpful with suggestions and tips. We had some questions about some of the beers on the menu and the server was able to give a good description and offered to get us a sample. Because of her knowledge and those samples we ordered beers with our meal as well. I think the most frustrating thing about the menu is that everything sounds so good.One thing that we figured out on our own is to have backup plans for everything you plan on ordering in case they are out. My son wanted an order of mushy peas and they were out and then again when we went to order dessert they were out of the Banoffee Pie. Other than that everyone was extremely happy with their orders. The over chips were on point, not too crispy that they were dried out, but not too mushy either. The garlic mashed potatoes were another hit off of the sides menu. I was a little disappointed with the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. I read in one review that is was like a vegan mac and cheese. Well to me mac and cheese is creamy and gooey. The order we got was more like an au gratin and not very creamy. Was still very good just not what i was expecting. Last really good thing is that the food is well seasoned. I didn't once have to ask someone to pass the salt or pepper. Kudos to the staff.   A few other things to keep in mind there is no custom ordering of pasties. They are made in batches and cannot be customized.   All of the desserts are large enough to share between at least two people. The Banoffee pie and Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding are good examples of that.   My Favorite is the Stocky Toffee pudding, again you can share it but after 1 bite you won't want to. either way i don't see how you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"I frequently travel to Las Vegas for work and usually I'll try to get out of whatever hotel/casino I'm staying at for at least one meal despite how exhausted I might be.  This one had been on my radar for a while as I had become curious about what a pasty might be after reading Harry Potter.. too many times.  This curiosity became a fixation after reading American Gods and Neil Gaiman's exquisite description of this delightful food item... again, too many times.  I finally made it over there a couple trips ago; I was seriously exhausted after my work day (a quick, one-night trip) but the restaurant happened to be right between my office and the hotel.    When I arrived at around 5:15, it there were a handful of other diners seated with no wait for a table and a mostly clear bar.  I ordered a cocktail (some sort of whiskey concoction, I can't recall which one specifically) and waited about 15-20 minutes for my order of two Shepherd's Pie pasties (one to-go for lunch the next day); I didn't think this was unreasonable as I am always willing to wait for good food and I would imagine pasties could take some time to assemble and bake.  The wait was totally worth it; that pasty was delicious!  I was so glad I took a leap of faith with ordering a second one for the next day.  I'm curious about the other options and all the interesting flavor combinations but I would not hesitate to return and order the same thing.  I highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"This place really is doing it right.  The pastys are tasty and large.  Service is friendly, but can be a little slow when the place is packed (Mesa location).  They recently expanded so I'm hopeful that they can keep up witht he added capacity."}
{"text":"Positive: The place is absolutely stunning! Was so excited to bring friends here for a drink.  Negative: Was shocked that a round of of 4 pints of LOCAL brew came out to $30! $7.50 pints?... Seriously obscene! This is probably why it was dead on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, this is not the kind of place you can treat friends. Seamus (across the street) is standing room only because their pints are NOT $7.50 lol  The George & Dragon has us spoiled with their $5 British Brew! Cornish Pasty is pretty tho... sigh. : \"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food outstanding beer. And the service is amazing. I am starting to run out of adjectives for this new find. I have been meaning to get over here for a while and finally made it.  Even the music stands out."}
{"text":"Cornish pasty = upscale hot pocket  I had the shepherd's pie pasty and Cole slaw. Both were fairly tasty. The Cole slaw had great crunch but was too oniony. The pasty was perfectly cooked unlike a hot pocket which is either frozen in the middle or scorching hot. The pasty had a lot of different flavors going for it and a good gravy accompanying it. Also the restaurant has a good vibe to it. All in all, the pasty was good but not good enough to come back.  HOT POCKET"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by co-workers when it was in Commercial Center. Awesome place, and great food! They've since moved downtown. Even better, closer to work so most of my office went the other day. By far the worst service ever. To be fair, we all got there at different times but within a 10 min window.  Our waitress got our drink orders as we got there and delivered them within mins of ordering. Efficient enough, however it took her almost 30mins after that to take our order. It then took another hour to get our order served to us. Seriously? Should have got up and left. Food is still good but not enough to get me back over there any time soon."}
{"text":"I never knew how much I loved pasties and English food until I came across this place. I used to frequent the previous location in the commercial center which was a tiny fraction of the size it is now. Parking isn't as convenient now but they make up for it with all the extra space inside and neat finishes/ambiance. They even have a couple pool tables now and space for events and live music. There are SO many exceptional items on their menu, but I'll just highlight my favorites.   Most of the pasties I've had here were vegan. During my last visits, they typically offer 2 different vegan pasties at a time. And surprisingly, there's a good variety of vegan choices they offer time to time (you can call ahead if you're curious to know what they offer that day). I think I might have tried at least 6 or 7 of them total throughout my visits, and I loved every single one. Even with vegan ingredients, they still achieve a perfect, flaky pasty. And they are so big, I almost always have left overs.   I highly recommend the mushy peas here as well. They are vegan last I checked. Even if you don't think you like peas, this side dish will have you eating your veggies in no time.  I was so afraid the first time I tried this that it would be like baby food, but they always get the texture right, and it remains as the one item I always have to order on every visit.  I am typically not one for sweets but the sticky toffee pudding (with ice cream) here is probably my favorite desert in town. It's heavenly and evil, it's sweet and savory, it's hot and cold, it's messy and beautiful.. it's like a gf/bf that drives you crazy - that's this dessert.  This is a place where you can taste freshness/quality in ingredients and appreciate the hard work that's put in the food. Other highlights include rad music (most of the time), iced teas (also great in cocktails), stellar staff/bartenders, and basically all the other food/drinks I didn't mention."}
{"text":"Cool little spot with great pasties! Tried quite a few options here over a period of time and they are consistently delicious and authentic too.  Large portions so go hungry.   Large selection of beers and always a good cider on tap.   Service is always top notch.  This has become my go to place in the area. I have brought many friends through and they enjoyed it too.   Have to try the banoffe pie...tastes of home"}
{"text":"So glad it's FINALLY open after waiting so long. The building is gorgeous inside and out. Was a little disappointed though. We were given a full menu, then a soft opening printed out menu with limited pasties available. I asked if the pasty I wanted was available and it wasn't. So I picked another one and my friend picked his off the same menu. I asked when will the full menu be available?  She said they've run out of things since they've been so busy. **I hate this excuse, you knew you were going to be slammed as hell, people have been waiting and waiting for this location to open; why wasn't enough inventory ordered to deal with the deluge of customers and orders you know you'll encounter? We ordered our drinks and chatted etc, 25 min pass and the bartender comes over and says to my friend they're out of the pasty he ordered. So he had to pick another one real quick. Why weren't we told this 25 min ago? We were thinking our food would have been coming out shortly. We waited over an hour and finally had our food show up. We were upstairs and it wasn't packed. Soft opening or not. Hopefully all pasties will be available soon and not running out again. The pasties were good when they arrived. I had the Reuben, was glad to see homemade 1000 island, my friend the meatball. The meatballs were extremely salty though. Definitely to much added to the batch. We got our check and we were charged for the Peppered steak pasty on top of the other two so had to tell the bartender we never received the peppered one since you said it was 86'd. This new location is going to be very busy so I look forward to a lil better experience next time like I've had at the Tempe and Mill Ave location."}
{"text":"Humble atmosphere. Great to watch them make the pasties right in front of you. Good serving. Lots of choices."}
{"text":"Soooo excited there's a Pasty near me!  I visited today and had my favorite Sherpards Pie.  It's best to pre-order as it takes time to cook these babies!  Call ahead, unless you're on a date ;) The service was great, the food was just as I expected and enjoyed the nice breeze where I sat just in front. It's a very classy place to eat, so stop complaining about some disrespectful prink writing on their bathroom walls, and enjoy the amazing food and view.    Parking was not bad, just had to park in the public lot for $2.00 around the corner.  Sure, it's not parking in front, but you're talking about a prime beautiful location, so pay the $2 for public parking and enjoy yourself.  I'm excited to visit again soon and try other tasty selections."}
{"text":"Ok the 3 stars are only for the food, the service deserves 5 plus. My wife & I visited this establishment on a Friday evening for our weekly date night. I don't remember the gentleman's name but we sat at the bar & he is from Hawaii. He was incredibly attentive & helpful in ordering our food & drinks. As far as the food let me set the scene. I am originally from Michigan & Pasties are a part of life there, every Grandmother passes down her Pastie recipe because they are such a part of that region. Traditional Pasties are cubed beef with onions, potatoes & parsnips sometimes with carrots & most people eat them with either Ketchup or Gravy. The dough should be flakey & buttery. I ordered the OG and the filling wasn't bad just very dry but the crust tasted like dried up cardboard. It came with some sauce that I can't even explain, maybe it's a Cornish gravy I'm really not sure. I ended up getting Ketchup to try to moisten the dough. My wife had the Chicken Pot Pie version & you would imagine it would have some sort of gravy inside but nope it was as dry as popcorn. We also got the Charcuterie board & it was fabulous. Again I can appreciate the fact that you are trying to put out enough to cover demand but you might want to find a pastry chef to help with making the dough. It seemed as if it was over mixed & over worked making it tough & tasteless. Equal parts cold butter & lard will give you a much flakier dough. I'm not writing this to bash the restaurant I'm only hoping to improve it. You have such potential & I wish you nothing but the best."}
{"text":"What can I say about one of my new favorite hangout spot? I'll try to make it short and sweet.   -The pasties are tasty, unique filling and reasonably priced (Love the chipotle sauce on the cajun chicken pasty).  - They have an awesome selection of spirits.  - The atmosphere is great (outdoor patio for when its nice outside and a dark cozy inside when you are out in a date).  - The desserts I've had so far have been very good (You have to have the Banoffee pie its legendary).  Overall, a great spot to go hidden in a small shopping center on University and Hardy. I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to go for a great meal and a cool vibe. The only reason why I'm not giving them five stars is that sometimes the pastys can be a little small, but taste-wise they always deliver! Great place for families, college students, anybody really! Service is always good as well. I recommend this spot for anyone who hasn't been. It's truly a place everybody should try!"}
{"text":"Great Food!  We shared a Pilgrim, the Original Oggie, and the Broccoli/Cauliflower bake.  The food and service was awesome!  We wished it was brighter inside so we could see our food."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had Postmates deliver this at about 1:30 in the morning. The food was hot, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My second time here. If you are expecting a traditional sit down restaurant this isn't it. It is dark with low light and candles. The cooks in the open kitchen look like a bunch of skater boys. But if you want a great Cornish pasty you are in the right spot. Go traditional and through in a scotch egg and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The best word I can think of to describe this place is charming. My boyfriend introduced me to this place and at first I was thinking of a fancy hot pocket (not something im particularly a fan of). As I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere from the dim lights to the dingy checkerboard floor tiles, it reminded me of one of those hidden treasures I used to find burrowed around NYC. I ordered a hibiscus tea which if you are like me and enjoy unsweetened tea you will absolutely adore it. I poked through the menu and nothing really caught my eye until I came across the lamb vindaloo and I had made my decision. The food took a while to get there but considering the very chill setting and laid back personality surrounding this place it shouldn't bother you at all. It tasted great the only improvement they could have made was maybe putting a little rice in the pasty as well but to each his own. What really made this pasty delish was the cream sauce that accompanied it. I brought the heat down while complimenting the flavor. When all was said and done I was stuffed and had leftovers. We also go the garlic mashed potatoes which are equally as amazing but I would advise against getting them for take-out because they only taste good fresh. Me and my boyfriend love this place so much that we started a project where we get Cornish pasty once a week. He is starting at the top of the menu and im starting at the bottom and working our way down and up and trying every single pasty on the menu. Oh yes....its happening."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! We enjoyed Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie, Bangers and Mash and Oggie Pasties... All delicious! Would've been 5 star if my review was on food quality alone.  The only server working was very nice but because she was the only one working, service was very very slow. Regardless, we will be back. Just allow extra time for possible slow service."}
{"text":"\"What on earth is a pasty?!\" and \"Where on earth was it located?!\" These were burning questions that became an obsession until I couldn't take it anymore. The juvenile humor in me kept thinking of nipple tassles and it being located near the infamous Green Door only fueled my misconception. Seeing this place given 4.5 stars, mostly from respectable Elites made it too irresistible for me. I didn't want to miss the train! I had the darnedest time finding CP inside the vast commercial center and even gave up after driving around aimlessly the first time. But I was a determined little you-know-what so I did a little more research and found it. Oh happy day! It's located next to the green storefront of Komol. A dark venue inside with a large bar and church pews with special molded iron barstools and a history lesson on the tin miners who originated the pasty. It holds true that as a \"hole in the wall\" type of establishment,  this place has excellent food that draws all types of foodies.  My daughter who is a foodie in the making ordered the OGGIE...the very first pasty on the menu. It's filled with steak, potatoes and rutabaga served with a wine sauce. Tender pieces of beef with soft potatoes and the bright pop of the rutabaga. Let's just say, she cleaned her dish with not a crumb left. I decided to make up for not finding it the first time, by ordering 2 pasties. The Pilgrim and the Chicken Tikka Masala. The Pilgrim is taking the best Thanksgiving leftovers and rolling it up in a flakey crust and the best part is having ample gravy and cranberry sauce to go with it (they will offer more upon asking). The Chicken Tikka Masala would rival any good Indian restaurant and served with a nice mint yogurt. Tender chicken breast so full of flavor and it tastes good even after sitting in the fridge a few days and reheated. These pasties are all handcrafted and made ahead of time then par-baked for 90 minutes. When you order, they are finished in the oven, then served neatly sliced in half with a perfect crust in every bite. Be sure to save room for the Shirley Temple pudding because it is life changing. It's served HOT in a mini caldron that is like 900 degrees which carmelized the sides of the pudding into a chewy crust, and you must get it with vanilla ice cream. Imported british treacle cake (just don't smell it lol) is so moist and has this toffee sauce on top that comes to you bubbling...careful not to burn your mouth. Bring everyone you know, they will thank you for introducing this unique eat to them. If they can't make it, you can get any pasty par-baked and taken home. Believe the hype!"}
{"text":"All around good experience. The energy here is great. The food was amazing. Service was a bit slow but not so much that it interfered with our experience. I would say this may be my new favorite restaurant!  Update: been back twice....yes...this is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Such great comfort food. The pasty is a family favourite of mine and finding this place (there are several around the Phoenix area) was a godsend. There is plenty of good choices to be made from the menu, with old regulars like the Oggie to more boutique pasties.. salads are great and healthy - we often have a salad and share a pasty between us.. and sometimes not!  However, this place does a great job at living up too the famous Cornish pasties of old.. New flavours with traditional style = great food! Plenty of beverage options and staff who go the extra distance to make sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"I have a small history with pasties.  Having close friends that have been eating pasties since before Christ was born + hanging around said friends for 20 years = a small history with pasties.  I recently heard about this place on Yelp and every time I saw the name, I managed to over and over mis-read it as pastry.  My only defense is that I keep getting those forwards from folks that say it doesn't matter the order of the letters or even if all of them are there, you're brain will figure it out anyway.  i guess this time my brain figured wrong.  I digress...  It never occurred to me that this little known dish would have it's own establishment run in its honor.  Of course, once I finally clued in that it was pasty and not pastry and stopped acting like someone hopped up on pills, I naturally invited my pasty-lovin' friends to share in the experience.  They too were elated at the variety of pasty options and the fact this was the restaurant's purpose and specialty.  An added bonus is how f'n cheap it is.  Talk about a steal!  This place was packed!  Someone said to get there before 8 or 830, but it was 7 and overflowin'.  We managed to fit 5 of us in the awkward geometrical booth built for 3.  My two pasty veterans ordered the Oggie with ketchup since that's what they grew up on (minus the rutabaga).  They both liked it, but thought it was a little spicy due to the rutabaga and the fact they are both ridiculously sensitive to spice induced heat.  One of their sig others ordered a chicken pasty of some sort which he thought was just okay.  The other +1 and I had the shepherd's pie and there wasn't a crumb to be found on either plate.    Our waitress seemed completely unfriendly and a little standoff-ish.    She warmed up as the meal progressed, chatted with us, and she ended up being a great waitress.  One of the guys drinks diet coke like he's in some sort of contest.  After he downed the first one in record time and the waitress gave him a curious \"you need a refill already\" look, he warned her that he drinks a lot of diet coke and will be gettin' a lot of refills.  About two minutes later she came back with a pitcher so he could refill till his thirst is content.  Rock star move on her part.  We all left full, happy, and ready for the next phase of the evening.  I'll definitely be back again - maybe even for lunch since I work relatively close.  Just remember pasty, not pastry.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I first went to the Mesa location but had to try the original one.  I was surprised to see that both places are very slim and long.  This location is very small.  How small you ask?  Small enough that the staff constantly has to stop what they are doing to step aside and let other coworkers pass.  They were good at it though.  I love trying different types of food, and if it's a small local I am definitely in.  After checking out the rave reviews I gave them a shot.  I loved my pasty (Pass-tee) at both locations but I was denied the shepards pie one in Mesa because they were out.  I lucked out and finally got it at this location.  Boy was that good.  Ground lamb just has a better flavor note to it that beef doesn't bring to the table.  We also had a little half salad and some roasted potatoes.  Both were tasty and the roasted potatoes have a coat of fresh thyme on them and didn't have the fat and grease factor of fries.  In a place this small it is impossible to have bad service.  You can literally reach out and tap the staff if you feel neglected, that is how close they are.  Why do they get minus a star?  Because I am 6'5\" and had to assume a yoga pose that I am neither familiar with, nor comfortable performing due to the closeness of the stool to the bar.  I could have chosen a table, but I live to drink in the experience.    They have several beers to choose from, bonus points for not having American piss water on tap and having a little variety.  The place is very casual with some personality too.    A little tip for those like me who broke the record for most U-turns within a 100 yards.  The place faces west on the NE side of the intersection between University and Hardy.  A little tricky at night because the sign may not be on and the little shopping center address isn't lit up either.    Great food, friendly and social staff.  Unique little place.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"4.5 but our waitress was great and the atmosphere was good so I'm rounding up.  Chicken Tikka Masala with Tahini sauce was great. Would definitely get that again.  Oggie (traditional) was good, but not impressive. I'd recommend it if that's what you're looking for, but I would maybe try a different traditional pastie like bangers and mash."}
{"text":"Its a bar that happens to serve meat pies. The food was good, but the ambiance of the restaurant was dive bar. Servers were nice and knowledgable / responsive.  Good Beer selection - I had take out.  Might give them a try again, although its not memorable."}
{"text":"Good beer selection (including local brews), good service, tasty pasty's - good standby downtown (i think this is a chain however). Not fine dining, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the shepherds pie pastry. It was a very unique pastry filled with meat and potato. The bar style restaurant is also a unique place to hang out.  The only negative comment I can make is that the music was not to my liking and was very loud. This made having a conversation difficult.  However, it is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I finally went for the first time with a group celebrating my best friend's birthday, and my own experience was sadly disappointing after hearing such great things. (Unlucky on Friday the 13th!)   First, their website does not distinguish what is available at this location from what isn't (and so I couldn't order what I had planned to get, the Rosemary Steak pasty; I got the chicken version instead).   Second, as to the food, what I got was tasty... until I bit into something that didn't seem quite right... Was it chicken skin? Nope, not with that color and consistency. So I pulled it out, and it turned out to be a large piece of wax or parchment paper... INSIDE the pasty. When someone else at the table mentioned it to a server (not the one actually handling our table, but he asked if we needed anything as he went by, so be aware their attentiveness is very good, and I was actually willing to let it go), even he was surprised it was inside the pasty, as he said it \"sometimes happens that paper gets stuck on the outside.\" (Inside or outside, it's still a problem they apparently know they have with the food prep, based on his statement.)  Third, although our server said she could not (would not?) separate the checks due to how busy they were that night when we asked upon first being seated (party of 7), she did at least run multiple payment methods for the single check (cash thrown in by some of us, and two cards used by people who didn't bring cash), so that was still a little inconvenient for us as a group -- not to mention confusing, so I hope she still got her full intended tip with all the confusion we had with having to do our own check and payment splitting (see next paragraph). Though, now that I think of it, I wonder if the check had the tip automatically added on, as some restaurants do that for parties of 6 or more (or is it 8?), in which case she would have been tipped doubly-well since I don't think any of us bothered to look for pre-charged tipping.  Be aware, despite the problems with my food, everyone else in the party was completely satisfied with their food and desserts (I envied my neighbor's apple pie pasty, it looked amazing). Even though my entree was removed from the bill, I still put in more than enough money to cover my part of the check as if it hadn't been removed, and so it should have gone to the server as part of her tip. She was having a rough night, they were REALLY busy, the problem with my food was not her fault, so she still deserved to be tipped well, made even better by the kitchen's mistake, in the end. (My logic is, just as a server shouldn't have their wages hurt just because of a Happy Hour, I always tip the server based on the regular prices for what I order and get served.) If the check had been separated, the extra tip would certainly have been guaranteed, though. (just saying)  All that being said, the place is deceptively huge on the inside, the menu is very broad, and I'm sure I will give them another chance (hopefully with less paper inside the food)."}
{"text":"It's hard to pass up a really fancy hot-pocket. Especially when the stuffing is anywhere from pesto chicken to the royal with cheese to traditional European eats like shepherd's pie to veggie and vegan options. All warm and delicious and folded into a flakey crust. Yum.   The staff has always been friendly and helpful when torn between two different pasty. They're knowledgeable about the menu and the beer selection. The ambiance is pretty chill and dark inside. A great place to go with a lover or friend. Or family haha.  Do what you like, but if you're in the area I highly recommend you get your booty over to Cornish Pasty and eat some of this tasty goodness."}
{"text":"Great food! Great beers on tap! They own it with there vegetarian selection. Plus Dean, the owner is pretty much a bad ass. Thanks for the t shirt old neighbor!"}
{"text":"Went to the downtown location before my flight out and it was exceptional. I only had an hour but because I knew what I wanted, I had more than enough time. You cannot go wrong with the peppered steak. Let me say that again. You cannot go wrong with the peppered steak. Do yourself a favor and order one right now!  I have eaten at three of the locations around the PHX area and I can say that this one has the best ambiance."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding, and thought that Cornish Pasty would be a hit because the bride's side of the family originally came from the U.K., and they had out of town guests from England.  We had a group of over thirty, and I was a bit concerned about how it would go.  It was wonderful.  We sat in the patio, and each guest placed individual orders for both food and drink.  The staff was wonderful, and the service was quick, congenial and faultless.  Not only were they not intimidated in the least by our somewhat rowdy group, they seemed to genuinely enjoy working with us to make a memorable night.  The food was wonderful, and stood the test of the British relatives.  I had never been to Cornish Pasty before, and was looking forward to it as I had recently traveled to London, and thoroughly enjoyed the food.  I had the Bangers and Mash, and it did bring back wonderful memories.   My review would not be complete, however, without mentioning Shirley Temple's Pudding.... PERFECT!"}
{"text":"WOW! this place is sooo good, stop by and grab a beer and pasty. They have a good selection of English beers to go with the array of pastys available. These things are like big hot pockets and they are delicious!   Did i mention $3 car bombs"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and chill yet invigorating atmosphere. Take the time and talk with the chef or server. They won't steer you wrong, keep your mind and options open."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place has pasties like nothing you can imagine.  The pub itself is pretty nondescript, but the food is out of this world.  I'm a fan of all kinds of meat pies and meat filled pastries, so this is right up my alley.  Their pastry is crisp and flaky, and their fillings are exquisitely prepared.  Service is adequate, about what you'd expect from a pub.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get.  They've got a huge range of flavor combinations, from chicken pot pie to lamb vindaloo.  I've never had one I didn't like.  Most of them are unbelievably good, and even the flavors I haven't liked as much would still be the best dish at most other restaurants.  They'll sell you parcooked pasties that you can freeze and finish baking later, so whenever we're in Vegas we always pick up a few to take home with us.  It means we can look forward to amazing meals with no work."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The service is on point. The atmosphere is awesome. This place is awesome for lunch and dinner or some late night hang over food."}
{"text":"Popped into Phoenix for business and yelped this place, as usual I was not disappointed. The food is excellent, had my infant son with me and the staff were amazing and so helpful. Had a really great time with friends and the beer selection made my day!"}
{"text":"This place quickly became one of my favorite spots to eat down town. Their Pastys are delicious, so many options to choose from but my favorite is the carne adovada. The rest of the menu is great too, the pasta salad is perfect for sharing  and so are their oven chips.   My favorite sever is Jason, he is always so friendly and gives great service. I've been there when he's super busy and always does his best to inform you of it and apologize for the wait, which makes you know that he's aware of you and is doing his best to get to you.   With this being said, last night was a different story. My friends and I took 4 new people to check out Cornish for their first time, we bragged about how amazing it is and were celebrating my best friend having just had a successful event across the street. We went in and unfortunately ended being waited on by Shonn who didn't smile, greet us and right away gave the impression he was pissed off. We ordered drinks first (Irish car bombs) and when he came back with them we asked if our friend who had just joined us could get one too. You can tell he was pissed because he wanted to take our food order so he could move on with his tables. I understand he was busy, but we were very patient did not rush him, we wanted to order food because we were all starving but we wanted to get the celebration shots out of the way. He eventually started taking our order and what made me go off on him is the fact that when one of my friends asked \"what's the best meat pasty?\" He replied \"there is over 40 options on the menu, go ahead and review it and let me know when you are ready to order\" and then looked at the next person for their order. I don't care how busy you are, if our table has a question for you, you don't give a smart ass reply. We then informed him we were done with his service and when we went up to the front to ask for a manager one of my friends asked a cook if Shonn's attitude was always so bad and he replied \"only if the costumer deserves it\" this came from someone who had no idea what had happened, didn't know us, and felt that we were deserving of this treatment, just because he wanted to defend his buddy. We have always been nothing but nice to everyone there and to get two people treat us so poorly just felt so aggravating.   We spoke to Hoku, the manager who handled the situation and apologized for our bad experience and took care of our shots. If it wasn't for him and the other sever I would never go back even if I love the food. These two jerks almost ruined such a great night for us and almost lost 9 costumers.    I plan on going back, but I will refuse to ever be waited on by Shonn."}
{"text":"After eating here about a dozen times, I've sampled most of the menu, and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places for lunch when I have the extra time and even better when we are able to spring for a beer. There is something for everyone on the menu here. I have tried a variety of their pasty's, but lately I've been stuck on the chicken portobello pasty. So good and the pasty crust is delectable. At some point I'd like to try a dessert pasty, but that might have to be a special trip.   The only small negative to this place is that the service can sometimes be slow. Also, note that it's pretty dark inside, so if you're with people who like a lot of light to read the menu this is not the place. They've increased the seating a lot, so it usually isn't hard to find a table, but it's usually pretty busy."}
{"text":"The service has actually been much better the past few times I've been here. I don't know if they hired more servers or what, but I appreciate it."}
{"text":"greatest place.  despite it being in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood- we saw two women walking in the parking lot with laundry baskets on their heads - i thought i was in a nat geo special!  - and it being really, really small and dark - i like it.  amazing vegetarian options - in fact, i think they have most of their regular options in vegetarian form.  and great beer on tap.  you don't mind waiting a while since it does take a while to bake these when you have a good beer to drink.   they even have the pastys raw so you can take them home and cook them there.   i highly recommend this place.   now all i ask is that you open one near desert ridge!! also..like i said, have some time to spare, since it does take a while for them to bake the food."}
{"text":"Imo, Cornish Pasty is the best place to eat downtown. From the location, to the nice ambience of the place, not to mention the food and drinks. Cornish Pasty has it all. They must have over 30 different types of pasties stuffedwith anything you can think of. including vegan options. Everything is fresh and prepared daily, you can taste the quality.  Not only are the pasties delicious, but the apps are great including baked wings, fries, and soup. Been here for lunch and dinner and never had an issue finding a seat but I do prefer sitting at the bar. Speaking of the bar, they have tons of good beer on draft and cocktails as well. Love the fact that after you eat, you can walk off all the food around the Arts District and check out all the cool spots."}
{"text":"Best pub atmosphere in town. Great food, staff is AWESOME at the bar. Would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more than five stars, this is one of my favorite restaurants, period.  I remember when this place opened, being British I was on my way over there as fast as I could drive to get a fill of a much-missed pasty. Back then there was only one location, and it was tiny tiny tiny. It's so exciting to see this place grow and expand like it has.  I've tried their entire vegetarian menu and it is awesome, with so many options. Their veggie tikka masala is my favorite. Freakin' good sides, too. I love their garlic red potatoes. Great beer list, I love their recent addition of a rotating sour beer.  Usually get good service.  It's dark and a bit dingy, sometimes a bit loud, a atmosphere that I think works well for the establishment. There's plenty of outside seating with heat lamps, too."}
{"text":"Amazing pasties good beer. Definitely has an edgy  dark, dive bar, dark and a little smelly atmosphere. Wait staff is great.  We had a meatball pasty which was great for an adult palate but a little basily for my eight year old. I had Guinness stew pasty and husband had cottage pie pasty. Soooo good! Scotch eggs were okay but a little overdone.  Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Five old guys went in at about 8pm on a Friday night. It was very crowded so the host seated us in a back room. The dimly lit room was filled with booths and it was dark enought that all of our 50+ year old eyes needed a candle or flashlight to read the menu. One guy even tripped over a hidden step that was sticking out from a sofa. Yes we laughed and made fun of him. The place has a bit of a dive bar feel. Just what I like. The music selection was excellent, deep cuts both modern and old. Loud enough to listen too but still hold a conversation. In this back room it was bar service only meaning we had no waitstaff. The people behind the bar were talkative, friendly, entertaining and very efficient. The menu is filled with a number of exotic pasty fillings, unlike the ground burger ketchup and potato mixture mom used to make. Nope, this is the real deal and ranges from chicken pot pie to salmon. The food was excellent, the beers were big, local and cold.  My only complaint is that the back room temperature was hotter than hell. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I have now eaten at both the Mesa and the Tempe locations of this company. This review is only valid for the Tempe location.  Several companions and I visited the Tempe location for dinner. The food was very similar to the food prepped at the Mesa location, but that is where the similarities end.  Compared to the Mesa location, the Tempe one is both a lot smaller and darker. I felt like I was going into a dungeon since our table was in a dark corner all the way in the back.  Our food was good, but the lack of sanitation was very apparent. Our utensils were dirty and had to be replaced, and then the replacements were found to be dirty and had to be replaced. This was not a good sign.   Floors could use a good vacuuming, as the area around us was littered with all sorts of items from pieces of food to pieces of paper and even a cigarette butt! I'm not sure how a cigarette butt got on the floor, since no restaurants allow smoking anymore, but there it was, saying hello to us.  Service was much slower than the Mesa location, and our server had a laissez-faire attitude that did not speak well for them. They were more interested in chatting with other servers than waiting on our table.  I've given the three stars only because the food is the same tasty dishes that are served in Mesa, but as far as I am concerned, this place needs a visit from the owner and from the health department."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience this past weekend at Cornish Pasty! We were able to celebrate our 20year high school reunion with over 50 people in attendance! It couldn't have been more fun. Special thanks to Hoku for helping to create such a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst service you will ever encounter. The very first time I went to this place I was told to take a seat anywhere I would like and they would be right with me. I sat down and waited for 20 minutes to not even being given a menu. I walked out and told myself I would never go again. Well, yesterday a friend of mine told me to go here with him and I have them a second chance. When I got there the waitress sat us down didn't have the order I wanted so I ordered another order and then waited 40 minutes for my food while there was only 3 other people sitting down. Here is the worst part though. The waitress that served me couldn't feel my water up because she was too busy at the bar sitting down talking to a bartender rather then helping customers. After eating it took us so long to even get a check that I got up to ask a cook if I can just pay him. Around the corner comes two of the employees who were sitting at a table talking to each other to finally come around and give me my check. This place is the most unprofessional resteraunt in all of Las Vegas. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! If you like terrible service and mediocre food then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Had the Shepard Pie and Chicken Pot Pie. Wow these things are awesome. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. When I first walked into the dark bar room style restaurant I was a little aback since I had my 2 and 3 year old kids with me. Opposite, the staff was kind and nice, gave the kids drinks and entertained their weird 2/3 year old questions. This place is awesome, if I lived in Phoenix I would be there much more often."}
{"text":"With 1,079 reviews (and counting) and a 4.5 star rating, I'm not sure what else can be said about the Cornish Pasty Company.   The food is always delicious, almost any beer you could want is a flowin', service is excellent and the atmosphere is on point.   Back in March one of my childhood buddies was visiting from Boston, and we hosted a Homecoming/Reunion party for him here.   I have to hand it to the staff for how well they handled our wild, crazy, LOUD group of 15+. Our drinks were never empty and I can't recall any hiccups on anyone's orders.   Also, on this visit, I finally shared some Banoffee Pie with Greg G.  Ho Lee Fook AMAZING. Why did I wait so long to try it?! Graham cracker, caramel coated crust with pillowy whipped cream and banana slices.   If Greg and I hadn't known each other for almost 20 years, I may have fought him to the death for the whole thing!  Any place I can get out for well under $30 after a filling entree (Lamb Vindaloo Pasty is my fave!) + two pints of Raj IPA is a winner in my book.  Don't ever change, CPC!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I WAS a huge fan of Cornish Pasty. I am a frequent visitor of the Tempe location, and this experience was a HUGE letdown. I called in to place my order for pickup \" Can I get XXXX. No we are out of that. Ok what about XXXX. No we don't have those either... what about XXXX. Ummm let me check, not we don't have those...\" finally after finding a Pasty that they actually have available I am told it will be ready in 15 minutes. I head down to the restaurant and give the server my name. I am told it will be another minute or two. 25 minutes later I ask how much longer it will be. Oh sorry there was a technical difficulties so it will literally only be another minute... 30 minutes later my food comes out. No remedy for the situation and no sorry about your hour lunch that was wasted. To top it off as I'm signing my receipt one of the cooks come up to me and says \"Oh your XXXX\" that's really good timing your food just came out... um no jackass I have been waiting in your restaurant for over an hour now its god awful timing...  Ok so after all of that grief I get back home and open my pasty to find it charred black on the bottom... I give up. Cornish Pasty will not get my business anymore.    ***Update, the Owner has reached out to me after this incident and is working with me to make amends. I decided to visit again a few days later and i received great timely service, they have a full menu now and food was ready when i got there and was fresh and delicious.Thank you for your effort. ***"}
{"text":"sorry to sort of buck the trend, but  I wasn't overly impressed. the service was friendly, but a little shaky. they got my order wrong, and I ended up eating part of a chicken sandwich, when I had ordered a vegetarian pasty (and yes, I am a vegetarian). they also served me tepid coffee, and I did overhear some slight staff bickering. the overall atmosphere is very hipster, dark, with fairly loud music playing (good tunes, but a little too loud). the booth was so flimsy, that every time I leaned forward to take a bite of food, the seat tipped with me completely. now the pasty...good flavor (if too many at once), but far too rich and unnaturally dense for me. and way too SALTY. after eating half of the sandwich, I felt like I was overloaded with salt (and full). how do you place items like cheese, olives, dressing, and meats in a pasty without there naturally being too much sodium content? you don't. not without things like lettuce, tomato, etc. (didn't have any). it desperately needed a salad to go along with it. it was nearly as salt-horrific as their neighbor, rosita's mexican food (not recommended). and anyone who thinks this is healthy food is mistaken. this place could make a vegan fat.  the only reason they get 3 stars is because of their unusual menu items, the fantastic side we ordered (broccoli and cauliflower cheese thing), the delicious desert (banana cream crusty thing),  and the potential for a better pasty experience next time (mental note: for god's sake, order a side salad!!)."}
{"text":"If you like bland,heavy,tasteless food with a poor beer menu then this is the place for you.I am never going back! Did I mention the poor service?"}
{"text":"Food like no other place! Wonderful food, great drinks, and even better dessert.  A true gem!    My family and friends feel welcome and whether empty or packed the service is on point!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few times since 2004.  Haven't been in many, many months.  Love all but one of the pasties I've tried, thus far.  Great to know that you can call ahead to custom-order!  Also, you may call ahead and have your order started so that it's ready by the time you arrive!  (It took one of my pasties 50 minutes' preparation and cook time from phone call to my table!)  Best to order a few and share!  Keep in mind, one of these pasties could contain up to 1200 calories or more!  One word: BUTTER.    Vegan pasties are also available, but you must call ahead to have them made."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, huge menu with tons of vegetarian choices. I recomend the Chipotle sauce and the garlic potatos with Cheese."}
{"text":"I have been to several of their locations and have not been disappointed. I have also tried varies patsy's and have enjoyed every one of them. Recently tried their roast dinner which also was fantastic. Tried a blood orange draft beer which I would highly recommend if you like blood orange.   This particular location is defitinely unique. Tri level building with a basement in Downtown Phoenix. I believe there was a bar on each floor. We sat up top where there was a billiards table and tons of windows."}
{"text":"One of the best stuff i have had... Jst dont forget to end ur meal with Shirley's temple pudding... Its one the most amazing desert i have had"}
{"text":"Really good Pasty place. Had the bangers and mash(awesome),Italian(awesome), and carne asada(ok)."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to eat in the valley. We first stumbled into Cornish Pasty with the thanks of Yelp a lil over a year ago. Been coming here ever since. I love this original location and its gotten even better with the expansion. For the money you really can not go anywhere as good in Phx. My wife usually can share one pasty and be plenty full.   As for which ones to pick my favorite is the Cajun chicken and the Meat and Cheese. I've also tried the pilgrim, Italian and original all which are really good. I'm just a meat and potato type of guy so I like the more basic pasty.   Overall a great place to come. It's dark, walls painted black, and usually good music playing. I've only come here for lunch so I can't speak for the night time scene but I'm sure it's chill and fun."}
{"text":"Having a mom from England, I am very picky with my Brit food. This place knocks it out of the park! So tasty, great service, great ambiance! Highly recommended! Just go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"If you've had real British food, then you'd probably think this place is on par with your previous experiences.    I think the concept is cool.  The food is OK but somewhat uninspiring...but then again this is British food (not a knock, just the truth).  I tried the Turkey pasty and Salmon pasty.  As for taste, I definitely give the edge to the salmon.    For dessert, I tried the Strawberry Palova.  It was good, but very rich so I could only a eat half of it.  The best thing about this place is that its very affordable for those who eat on a budget.  We had two pasties, dessert, 3 glasses of wine and a Sprite for less than $50.  If you've never been, I definitely recommend checking out this place."}
{"text":"I need to confirm that the Cornish Pasty Company is a pocket of heavenly yum yum. My husband got himself a peppered steak, I grabbed a salmon asparagus pocket and my daughter snagged a meats and cheese version. Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale.  Right away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier. I was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated. I could bring my veggie friends/family here too. I knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go! Update: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy."}
{"text":"So I feel really bad cause honestly I don't usually post bad reviews of places people rate highly. But I mean come on ten bucks for something that a hot pocket could beat out?  I liked the fresh lemonade but the pastry and the fries were just plain awful. I got the chicken Alfredo and the meat was deff not fresh the marinara was decent but not great just not very good at all. It's hot inside the restaurant more than what I find comfortable a little too dark for my taste and the seating isn't very inviting either. Not to mention the shady part of town it is in yuck.and another thing that bothers me if this place is so fresh and great why can't I order something without onions?  I wad told if it had onions on the menu they could not take them out that screams frozen or bagged product to me."}
{"text":"The worst service i ever got. Left bed Fore our food even made an entrance. I will. Ever come back here again"}
{"text":"Good place to eat! First time to have a pasty and it was delicious! Make sure you try the mushroom and walnut soap!! Very good! The bread that came with the soap was just as good! Nice place to hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Fancy hot-pockets?! Amazing. They have a great vegetarian & vegan selection as well. A little annoying that you're not able to change the ingredients in the standard pockets (they're pre-made), but they do offer a huge selection that helps make up for it. The atmosphere is laid back & great place to grab a drink & make new friends at the community tables or the bar."}
{"text":"Great dishes enjoy the atmosphere. I liked their stout beers. New location is bigger and better with the pool table and bar. Good prices. Sticky pudding dessert is a must have."}
{"text":"Was hard to find at first and looked very intimidating, but once you got in it was a very chill environment/pub. Friendly people and low key. Oh yeah, AND GREAT PASTIES(rhymes with last)!"}
{"text":"Gotta say I was skeptical the 1st 15 mins I was here because everything that could go wrong was. The wonderful Erick helped me decide on what to eat and the manager Dean created an amazing Cajun Chicken pasty that was cooked to perfection. The pasty itself was a little bland, but I'm happy it wasn't overly salted. The Chipotle sauce that comes with the pasty was perfect. I can't wait to come back and try more food."}
{"text":"God, I love this place. Every location is awesome. The food is always great. I've never had a single problem other than having to wait because it's packed with so many other people enjoying the awesomeness.   While I do love the pasties, it's great to venture to other areas of the menu as well. Their handmade soups are fantastic and I try to always save room for some. I've had both the Pavlova and the dessert pasty and I could go in for those alone.  They usually have great music playing and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Soooo...I convinced my Grandpa to come here with me which was no easy feat.  He is 94, very stubborn, and only eats Italian and American food. He is a regular at Samstown Buffett and Olive Garden (which he thought was a little local joint with authentic Italian....boy was he surprised when I explained to him they were nationwide and almost as common as McDonalds.).  Anyway, as soon as he saw the menu, he said, \"I don't think we can eat here.  There's nothing here we like.\", meaning him of course, because I eat everything.   The menu has a few soups, sides and salads, but everything else is basically a meal served in a hot pocket style bread wrapping. Almost like a pastry, but don't get it confused, because this is pasty with no R.  And they are real quick to correct you on that every time you mispronounce it too.   So, I ordered a cup of the Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup at the urging of the waitress. You ask what is Stilton?  Well, so did I. The waitress said it was like a blue cheese...as she is explaining this, I was shaking my head and turning up my nose.  Then she said, yeah I don't like blue cheese either, but this is good. So I ordered it.  Mistake!  If you don't like blue cheese...don't get Stilton anything!  It actually had a pretty good flavor, but then the aftertaste of the blue cheese creeped into my mouth.  Yuk!   Luckily she took it off the order.  LOL!  Ok, so I don't eat EVERYTHING. ;)  Next I ordered the potato chips, which were very well done. I also asked for plain, but could tell they had garlic on them. They were strangely hard on the outside, but still soft in the middle. I actually liked this texture  as weird as that is. The garlic was good, but I wanted to share with my Grandpa and he doesn't like garlic.  Didn't really matter, because he took one bite and was over the texture instantly.   Lastly the pasty I ordered was the bangers and mash.  It was pretty good. I loved the pastry outside of the bread. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the sausage had a good flavor. The waitress said the sausage was made in-house too.   My picky Grandpa ordered the chicken pot pie, which he really liked. HaHa, I told him he needs to venture out and try new things.  He kinda agreed, but I'm not stupid....I won't be taking him next door to Lotus of Siam anytime soon.   I'll be back, because I really want to come and try some of the different options. Who's in?  :D"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was sooo fresh and delicious. Also the staff there is very friendly and accommodating. They have a great vegan and vegetarian selection!! I've never had anything quite like it. It's almost as if a pot pie and a hot pocket gave birth to a sophisticated child, but whatever the case it was delicious."}
{"text":"The food was great! I wanted to eat outside but it allowed pets outside in its seating and bar area. The waiter was friendly but never came back to see if we needed refills."}
{"text":"FUCKING FINALLY!  Been to plenty of CPs around the valley and this one is distinguishable only by its decidedly downtown vibe. But what really sets this place apart is the truly inspired tap list: Gulden Draak? 1664? Bacchus? Fullers ESB??? YES PLEASE.  Factor in Lou Reed blaring on the stereo upon walking in and this afternoon just went from 6 to midnight"}
{"text":"We have seen this place a few times when we visited another place and were really curious as to what this place is.  Never having a Pasty before, I really wanted to give this place a try and see what the food was like.  Its also a bar, so you get the best of both worlds here, food and drink.  I had the Shepard's Pie Pasty and it was WOW...If you like Shepard's Pie, this is a place you have to try because I can tell you have have never had anything this good and its a Shepard's Pie like none I have ever had.    The menu has a great variety of choices and if you do not know what a Pasty is, it is what ever kind of meat and veggies you want inside a dough folded, cooked and cut in half.  It is definitely a meal and the prices are not outrageous.   The only sad part for me but hopefully great for them is that they are moving from the current location to Charleston and Main.  The parking will not be anything like it is here at this location, so I hope it all works out for them.  The other thing is the bar currently only serves beer and wine and at the new location they will have a full liquor license which can only be a positive.  I would highly recommend this place if are looking for good food, a friendly staff and an all around nice relaxing time."}
{"text":"This place serves delicious and affordable British comfort food and beer. The atmosphere is unpretentious, cavernous, and it feels like you are in Harry Potter. The pasties are essentially upgraded hot pockets on steroids and deserve to be devoured immediately.   I enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) and Peppered Steak the most. They were served hot, generous, and satisfying. The side of oven chips with garlic and jalapeno (on request) made for a great combination and only further induced my food coma.   Adding more to the mix, the sticky toffee pudding was fantastic. I'm not sure who concocted this dessert, but they deserve all the accolades they get. Limited seating, but ample parking, come here if a pang for comfort food sparks."}
{"text":"Another great visit to Cornish Pasty. We prefer to sit on the lower level of this gorgeous three-story restaurant. We were served by a bar tender and started with the tandoori chicken wings, very tasty! We split the cheeseburger royale as our entree, which we both enjoyed other than picking out the mushrooms. My only complaint about Cornish is that you cannot customize because they make the pasties ahead of time and just bake them when ordered. We were offered a nice selection of adult beverages and enjoyed the dark and swanky atmosphere this level offers. A good value for the food and just a neat place to bring out of town guests or when looking for a great meal when in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and loved it. The potatoes and stilton soup was to die for. Before tonight I had never had a pasty but I'm a fan now. I loved being able to watch them make them right in front of you. Hubby had the chicken pot pie pasty, and I had one with steak and bell pepper. We finished the meal with the to die for caramel apple pasty with vanilla ice cream. Yummy. The bartender was so sweet and ran the place well. We can't wait to go back. A true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Got in late on a flight and this was one of few things open. What a great find! I had the bangers and mash pasty and the chicken pot pie pasty (I couldn't decide). I couldn't pick a favorite because both were delicious. I also ordered a side of the broccoli and cauliflower bake since the entrees were not served with a side. It was good, but not really meant for take out, so I can't hold that against them. They did their best to package it up. All food was served hot out of the oven and was prepared quickly. So yummy! Beats late night fast food any day! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"GuuuuuuuuuuurL!!!!!!!!! This place is amazing and sooo tastey! I usually try to keep my focus on one particular item but I caaant! Now, every time I try Cornish Pasty I will get something diff ( So many menu items! ) and complely satisfied errrry single time!   Okay but tbh there is ONE thing that makes me set time aside for the drive there --toffee bread pudding (aka TBP). Lately I've taken my orders Togo, besides who doesn't love streams of melty vanilla-ice-creamed all over the best toffeed cake -and slowly, real slowly, extracting all its flavors with the press of you tongue. Yummm....   Ah! Forgot what I doing for a sec! Not much else to say..... You must Do!"}
{"text":"Came in after work for a late night dinner to go, around 1 am. I gotta say RJ, the bartender, was working so hard! I was really impressed with his efficiency taking care of multiple patrons. Good work!"}
{"text":"My first pasty experience and it was a good one. Think of pasties sort of like adult hot pockets. This place has a unique, fun vibe and tons of pasty options.   A++ for all of the vegetarian options and even a couple vegan options. I also love the interior.. it's super roomy inside which is kind of unexpected for a downtown spot. They even have a pool table, shuffleboard table and long bar area towards the back.   As for food I went with the Veggie Chik'n Tikka Marsala and the Oven Fries. The fries were so good! I got them with garlic which you definitely need to be a garlic fan because it is quite powerful. The pasty was also pretty good. I liked the yogurt sauce on the side, but I think I'd try something more traditional next time with cheese or potatoes.   I'd definitely be back again to try more. Also love the Moscow mules, so good!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to with a group of friends with out the tourists crowd  near you... Good chill music and great selection of beer... The food.. Well that's another story.. One word.. \"Yum\" the great place to try the tasty pastries that bring a smile to your face after..."}
{"text":"We have lived next door to this place for over 2 years before we ever ate here. WTF were we thinking, this place is AWESOME! Great Service! Great Food! Oggie is my favorite. Salmon is fantastic and the bread is delicious! We always have seen a lot of people over there and now we know why."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors and extremely unique the only down side was the 45 min I had to wait after I ordered my food at 4pm."}
{"text":"I love both locations. It is a rare menu that has so many things I would actually eat without subtractions. I have only been 4 times (and tried something different each time) but I want to keep coming back. I am working my way through a long list of pasties that I want to try. Keep in mind, I dont drink alcohol so I am not eating this stuff just to accompany a Guinness or Strong Bow. I really like it. All of it.  My only complaint is that the Tempe location does not allow for groups larger than 2. OK, they have a couple of tables for 6 but thats really it. If you dont get there before the dinner rush, you dont get to sit with your group."}
{"text":"the food is so good and so many choices but like many of the reviews the service is a little off but for unique and tasty food i can deal I've only been to the Tempe one so i can't speak for the other ones yet"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. The atmosphere was very dark and lowly lit. No reservations needed...you find a seat. Tried the leek soup. It was delicious. Also tried the chicken pot pie...was very good. Big portions I had half to take home."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a 3 on my first try and I'm more than willing to try it again.   The restaurant is pub like setting.  Don't be afraid of the hood :)  What is behind my 3 stars is that everything I ate was salty.  When we had arrived, we got lucky because it was not at the time busy.  There seemed to be only one person on the floor taking care of the bar and the orders.  I had to chase him down for a refill on my tea.    I started off with Mushroom walnut spinach soup.  Its the consistency of chunky baby food.  I think what I should have done was see if I could of taste tested the soups they had available before choosing this.  I attempted to finish the soup but really couldn't because of the saltiness.  Even dipping the bread didn't help.    I love garlic fries, so I went for the garlic oven chips.  Its almost like steak fries.  It wasn't smothered in garlic as I would have wanted to my liking, but again the over seasoning of salt overwhelmed the \"homemade\" taste.    For my pasty I had the shepards pie.  I have a thing for shepards pie so that was why I chose that.  Now my description of a pasty is a combination of a Empenada/Porowski (If you know what those are), but on steroids.  You may think that the portions look small, but if you are not that hungry, I bet you will take your other half home.  I went for lamb in my pasty and as I took a bite, I thought that I should of went the latter.  The gravy has more of a wine taste than regular brown gravy.  So, I attempted to put Siracha on it, but they had the Lum Kee Siracha.  Must get the rooster one.    That was my experience, from my point of view.  I'm not willing to give up on this place.  I'll find a pasty that I like so I can enjoy along with other yelpers that liked Cornish Pasty Co."}
{"text":"From the outside you would never expect such a comfortable and friendly little bar. The food is fantastic, music is always great and I love the ambiance that comes with such a tiny and dark little bar. That may be a complaint for some but it feels so much more comfortable and inviting to me. The wait can sometimes be long but it is worth completely worthwhile. I'm very excited for the expansion project to get underway, this restaurant is perfect."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a co-worker, my husband and I decided to try this out.  We had checked out the website and menu, so knew what we wanted to try.   First thing, in a lot of pictures, the place looks really cramped and small...wrong!   When you first walk in, there's a narrow hallway with a bar on one side and small 2-seat tables on the other.  But, if you walk around the corner, it opens up into a pretty large dining room (there's also a bar in here), as well as a nice sized patio. We seated ourselves, and were immediately met by Hannah, our server.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We perused the menu, but we both pretty much knew what we wanted.   I ordered \"The Pilgrim\" and my hubby ordered \"The Reuben\".  While we waited for our pasty's, we were able to enjoy the music playing.  Lots of our favorites, so the wait didn't seem like too long.   \"The Reuben\" is basically exactly what it sounds like...a reuben sandwich in a flaky wrap.  It was served with a side of 1000 island dressing.  My husband loved it, before I had a chance to ask for a bite...it was gone!! \"The Pilgrim\" is like a Thanksgiving dinner in a pasty.  It had roast chicken (during the holidays they serve it with roast turkey, but honestly, I couldn't tell the difference), sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions.  It was served with a side of cranberry sauce.  OMG!!!  It was delicious and moist.  The chicken was so juicy.   Each bite reminded me of the day after Thanksgiving sandwiches...only this wasn't leftovers.  I devoured it!  My husband, who doesn't like stuffing, kept saying that when we go back, he's gonna order it.  Delicious!!! The flakiness and flavor of the dough is wonderful.  Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed. We're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"This is the best Cornish Pasty shop in the whole USA. The first time I came I took four to go, today I'm back for more.   For the authentic Cornish taste, drink with scrumpy cider.   Don't forget to turn the menu over for Over Chips, Mushy Peas and more all as sides."}
{"text":"What is a pasty?? and why was I pronouncing it paste-y like my skin, rather than past-ee like I am supposed to pronounce it?  Last Saturday night after the Rebels won a nailbaiter vs Boise State, we got a rita and some nachos at Paradise Cantina.  Then I decided we should continue dinner at Cornish Pasty Co. because it was nearby and everyone was rating it highly.  We sat at the bar, which has some very cold barstools!!!  There is a purse hook underneath the bar which is a great feature.  Our server was very cool, did not catch her name.  I got iced green tea which was great.  Eric R. is still not on the black tea bandwagon and only likes hot green tea, so he stuck with water rather than get British black tea.  I ordered the pilgrim (roasted turkey/chicken with grilled onions, stuffing, and sweet potato) served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce (gelled, the best!) - and Eric R. got the chicken tikka masala with the mint yogurt sauce (tahini was the other option).  While we waited for our meals to be prepared, we watched a chef in front of us at the bar prepare the lamb vindaloo pasties (what I almost ordered, and will definitely get next time).  I was intrigued because the night before, I had learned how to make dumplings.  Now in front of my eyes, a chef was making essentially a giant dumpling, using egg wash instead of water to seal the dough but crimping it similarly!  I felt my parallel universes collide.  Our pasties came out piping hot and cut in half.  Eric R. learned something new about me that he didn't know (and that is hard for a married couple): that I really like gelled cranberry sauce and even enjoy the canned one.  I never think about it though so I never buy it or talk about it!  The pilgrim was very delicious.  Eric R. asked to swap halves so we ended up eating each other's first halves.  The chicken tikka masala was very moist and the curry sauce was spot on.  Eric R. thought it was a tad too spicy for him which means mild for me :)  Then we started on our second halves and ended up switching plates entirely.  He really liked the red wine gravy and I was quite happy with the CTM.  The vibe is cool and it was a hot spot just for people to drink while we were there.  It is located just north/left of Komol.  Whenever I go to Commercial Center, I will have to choose between Cornish Pasty, Komol, and Ma Dang...that is tough!  There is an extensive vegetarian menu too.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly fantastic!  Wow, when I pulled up this place I thought--what a dump!  I wasnt sure if it was even open or abandoned. I took my chances and went in anyway.  My first thoughts upon entering were--let me leave! The walls were painted black, super dark and just didnt look that great.  But there were people at tables and at the bar, who looked like normal folks so I said screw it, let me try the food.  Wow!  I was blown away at how good the food was.  The pasties seriously tasted just like the ones I had in the Uk!  There was nothing divey about the service or the food or the beer.  Total shock!  I highly recommend this place for Brits in the Vegas area missing a bit of home!  Will definitely come back.  Dont let the outside or inner decor fool you!  Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Greek pasty and it was awesome. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that it was a bit expensive for how big it was. But it tasted amazing and was very fresh... just too expensive for the size."}
{"text":"The broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is better than the oven fries! It has a fantastic crunchy topping. They also have a great beer selection and several yummy desserts to pick from. All the pasties I've tried were delicious."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday and didn't have any trouble parking or getting a table. Not sure if that is because it was the middle of the day... or if its because its summer and so no students were around. Anyway, they have the same awesome food as the other location so I was well satisfied! This time I ordered the bangers and mash and it was fantastic. I love the red wine gravy dipping sauce. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Pasties were authentic and fantastic.  Not dry or over cooked in any way. The server forgot to send in our order, but he comped a couple of our Boddingtons, so that is ok.  Next time I'm in town, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This spot is great! I've had the porky and the traditional and they were both on point. Staff and management are amazing and very attentive. They also have a great beer selection! 1664 and boddingtons on tap and coors original in bottle (surprisingly hard to find places) I plan on coming here a lot more!"}
{"text":"Just had the Bangers and Mash with the Red Wine Gravy... Totally awesome I usually get the Lamb & mint. But wanted to try something different.  What a great Pasty will definitely get again.  This is such a great place, you definitely need to take a trip especially if you have never tried A pasty before.  Also Great Beer Selection."}
{"text":"I thought pasties were those patches that cover a woman's nipples, but in this case they refer to a raised semicircular comestible made in the tradition of Cornish miner's lunches. After seeing all the Yelp reviews, I had to make it to Cornish Pasty Company. Great options for vegetarian and carnivore alike. Great beer selection on tap. Service here was great, the staff seemed to genuinely want to make it great. They definitely have a system here to serve up all these pasties, from freezer to fridge to oven, but the end product was still fresh and served piping hot. A unique experience, and definitely worth a visit. Now where in Phoenix can I find the other type of pasties?"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Vegas! I've been to the UK many times and this place is the most legit pasty place I've found in the states. Super fresh outer crust which they make daily and your pasty is baked to order. So you will have to wait a bit to get it, but it's well worth the wait and the uber ride out to this off strip eatery. Every person I've brought here has enjoyed their food. The giant post apocalyptic strip mall looks daunting, but trust me, you want to eat here."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is a downtown Las Vegas hot spot. It is placed in the eclectic arts district with a wonderful variety of food for both meat and non-meat eaters. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable about their seasonal beers, and their items are reasonably priced. You can order anywhere from a vegan chicken salad to a vegan pasty. Their meat pasties are equally delicious. There are so many different types, that you are bound to find one that hits the spot for you. This is one of the few spots in Las Vegas that you can find rare beers.   Try the potato leek soup The cheese charcuterie plate The Greek salad with veggie chicken The Mexican Pasty  The rosemary chicken Pasty  Also, you can actually order the pasties \"half cooked\" and bake them at home! Such a wonderful asset."}
{"text":"The kitchen was slow on cooking up the pasty that I ordered up.  Besides the lag during the lunch run, the peppered steak pasty with mushrooms and leek, was a bit on the salty side, but very homely to eat.  It was surely a filler and complimenting with a beer, which they have a variety to choose from.   There were other pasties to try as well. Thanksgiving is coming up so I was on the edge to try turkey with stuffing pasty, but was thinking that I will have a feast of that in the coming month!  One staff knew his pasties so he recommended well.  They have 3 tea selections and it was refreshing for the warm day.    It's a spacious pub and sort of looks antique.  It suits the pub pasty experience.  Lots of room for dining!   Comfort spot!"}
{"text":"So glad I yelped this place! I would have never came in on my own. Outside looks like a hole in the wall that might not even be open. Once you walk in whole different story! My new spot! I ordered the cauliflower as appetizer, salmon and peppered steak. Don't know exact name but they were great! Service was good too!"}
{"text":"The \"lil bit o salmon\" is off the chain! Hearty and delicious! Service is always welcoming and the desserts are awesome! I hate that it gets so crowded at lunch - but thats what happens when you serve up solid food for decent prices!  You have to try this place, definitely a hidden gem in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Bloody awesome. Seriously.  Ok, my significant other and I walked in around 8 pm on a Friday night. I think if we came a little earlier we'd probably have to wait for seating. We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.  I don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.  Everything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.  It'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games."}
{"text":"I love Cornish pasty. I've never had a bad meal at any of their locations. My boyfriend and I love the pilgrim, the Italian, and the chicken pot pie pasty, but we're excited to try some of the others! I've never been to their happy hour, but drink prices are already pretty low and their deals on HH look amazing too. Even better, they serve 32 oz beers on draft!! The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the service is often slow, especially at Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I visited this restaurant over the weekend. We had a different original perception of what it was, never having actually had a pasty before. I ordered the reuben pasty and it was good. The meat had a good flavor, some sauerkraut and the thousand island was brought on the side. The meal was a good size and left me satisfied - although I kept thinking about Sweeny Todd while eating the lunch.  The one downside I found with the restaurant is that we arrived near opening and even though we were the only two in the restaurant, the music was so loud that we could barely hear each other talk. Otherwise, it was a pleasant accidental finding."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall greatness. Sorta pricey though, but, if you're a potato fan this place will rule your soul -- and you will have no complaints."}
{"text":"First visit to the new location and I have a few thoughts:  The new location has street parking only.  Let me repeat that, STREET PARKING ONLY.  Almost prefer the old location in the Commercial Center where you never had to struggle to find parking.  There are no televisions at all, not even one.    They have a paper beer list with 24 beers; and the server volunteered that four of them were not available after the one I tried to order wasn't available.  They undercharged me $1 for the beer I did order. (menu, $10; my receipt, $9)  The new location has street parking only.  Let me repeat that, STREET PARKING ONLY.  The food item I tried to order (cottage pie) wasn't available.  Server didn't inform of unavailable menu items when she brought menu.  I asked how the \"Cornish Style\" cole slaw was prepared and the server vaguely said \"it's our take on cole slaw\" and volunteered that it wasn't ready yet and still being made.  The new location has street parking only.  Let me repeat that, STREET PARKING ONLY.  I was there early in the day and they were not busy.  Service was good.  My food was good.  It is frustrating when a restaurant I like doesn't live up to their potential.  It's not hard to edit a Word document then print 20 copies of your beer list, so your customers  have something accurate and your staff isn't on the front line saying sorry, that's not available over and over.  It's not hard to have a pre-shift meeting and communicate to your servers what menu items are not available, so they can, in turn, communicate to customers.  It's not hard to manage the kitchen and have the items listed on your menu actually available to sell during your operating hours.  Or, maybe it is?  The same management team who decided to relocate their restaurant to a location with NO PARKING AT ALL is managing this place and the first impression wasn't a good one.  I hope they succeed, because I like the food here and I've always enjoyed the locations in the Phoenix area.    Overall, a disappointing experience today.  If you come here, lower your expectations with regard to what's actually on the menu, and bring your patience when you park.  Or, just take an Uber."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding food. We were warned by a friend that this restaurant is I'm an unusual area - a strip mall of sorts. And they were right. We were also told the food was great. It was outstanding. So many types of Pasties, they make their own sausage. And some really great combinations. I had the Carne Adobavo pasty. Filling was spicy and excellent. Service was great, too.  Besides, really wonderful to have such good food and get off the strip where everything is overly packaged even when the food is great."}
{"text":"Now, we might have gotten some strange looks from other patrons cause we brought Baby C here cause well...this place IS a pub after all.  But they do serve food and we weren't ordering Baby C car bombs or anything and he was behaved - so those people can go \"Sit On It\"!  J ordered a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup and an order oven chips with garlic.   My Pasty - The Mexican J's Pasty - Bangers and Mash  The soup was awesome - he shared a few spoonfuls with me and Baby C.  Baby C went crazy for it!    My Pasty - Very tasty.  The right amount of spice.  Not oily.  Very filling!  I could only eat 1/2 of my pasty.    J didn't like his pasty all that much.  He said it was extremely salty and heavy.  Wished he would have ordered something else instead of trying to go somewhat authentic.    The oven chips were kind of a disappointment.  I wouldn't order them again due to a good portion of them being still on the raw side.      So it was kind of a hit or miss depending on what you ordered.  Might be able to talk J into going back again and have him try a different pasty."}
{"text":"The service gets more and more dismissive every time I come here.  I wait longer and longer to be acknowledged and the waiting periods of being ignored after initial contact get bigger. At this point, I feel like coming back here knowing this is comparable to holding your breath under water...the longer you wait, the more it sucks; but for some inexplicable reason you keep trying to outdo yourself and beat the clock. But the beer is cold and the pasties are tasty...and one day I'll remember to wear my horn rimmed glasses and not cover up my sleeve tats, maybe that will help."}
{"text":"Love the food at Cornish. Great beer selection. Usually the staff is on par, but a ton of turnover so you never know."}
{"text":"Delicious! Can't wait to go back! Had the Moscow mule and an Italian pasty, thoroughly enjoyed both. There are so many other things on the menu I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"I'm glad we finally have one of this in las vegas. If you never had a chance to try any of these restaurants you must go. To give you an idea their menu consist of a pastry filled with pretty much anything you can think of. Their menu are pretty extensive, they even have vegetarian options! Their atmosphere is pretty chill and laid back. Just imagine your typical British bar and thats pretty much what you will find when you visit this place. Oh the best part of it: they have several beer options including some ginger beer!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastys and salads! Great atmosphere,  fast service. Cute location near historic hotel."}
{"text":"Nice food and drinks.  They've serial options for vegetarian as well. Lovely ambience.   A cool place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome Pasty's!!  So many pasty options! A bit dark inside but, great spot for a cold winter day... great concept and delivery! I will stop by anytime I'm within 50 miles! Where is the pasty shop in SF??!"}
{"text":"I have to give this four stars for quality and fresh ingredients of the food. I sat at the counter top and watched them make my pastry. It was great! Think of the a very fresh hot-pocket with dipping sauce. Service was fair; they could be a little more friendlier."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The food is good, but and a very big but , their service is horrendous. So so bad ,  This is not the first nor 2nd time I've had  a shitty experience.  This place NEVER ANSWERS THE PHONE HOW CAN YOU ORDER FOOD ?!?)??  I called literally 30 times today no one answers cos they are prob putting the phone off of the hook  The foods 4/5 but the staff and their lack of fucks is very very apparent and ruins the whole damn experience. Which is sad because this place is good...."}
{"text":"A unique experience all around... dimly lit ambient place which used to be a hole-in-the-wall serving a large selection of beer and their famous \"pasty\".  I always get their lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, lamb & mint, cajun chicken, and Lovely bit of Salmon. I find that Newcastle Brown and Boddington's goes great with most of their pasties. Be sure to try their Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"Visiting Tempe for a few days, loved this cozy little spot in a busy college neighborhood. We sat at the outdoor bar (love!) to order drinks and pasties. The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable and provided us with excellent recommendations. Both pasties were fresh and delicious. I asked about leaving out black olives from mine, but they're all pre-made, so special orders are not a thing. Otherwise great experience. We would eat there all the time if we lived in AZ!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. The service is incredibly slow and the staff is very rude. It took us 15 minutes to even get water/menu and that was only when we ASKED for it. It also took us about 20 minutes to get the check picked up. And again, we had to ask for it. The food itself can be pretty good. But today when we went, they were out of half the menu. Incredibly unprofessional. I had to order something that was disgusting and did not even finish it due to how gross it was.   I have been multiple times before and ALWAYS have slow service with rude staff. Please please do NOT go to this restaurant. I will not be coming back. I really hope the owners read this but I do not think they would care anyway."}
{"text":"First time eating Pasties and I'm impressed! Quite the local favorite. :)   I had the pepper steak pasty and it did not disappoint. Pepper steak pasty was very filling but not large in terms of portion (it must have been all that starch from the baked bread). The various ingredients were fresh and right out of the oven hot. There were some nice mushrooms, peppers, and onions that complimented the pasties very well. The pasty may have been a little too salty for me but it was still delicious.   Another notable item was the oven chips. They were very delicious with its combination of flavor with the garlic and jalapenos. The ketchup that came along with the oven chips seems to be very fresh rather than using a bottle of Heinz.   Overall, a good impression from eating here after a long day on the road to Tempe."}
{"text":"Best food experience I've had in a while.   It was nice out so we sat on the patio. The inside is also really dark and I bumped into my partner so inside was out of the question. Other than the lighting the inside is pretty cool. Large bar as well.   Their vegetarian menu was almost just as long as their meat containing pasty list. They even had two vegan options! I had never had a pasty before and I probably shouldn't have another again unless it's from here (we don't have much food like this is San Jose). Came out hot and pretty fast. I was impressed. Really flaky on the outside and hearty on the inside. Like a hot pocket on crack x1000. Delicious.  The service was the cherry on top. The staff are incredibly friendly and genuine.  I think our server's name was Garrett(?) He was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love the pastries every single time-- they have so many delicious options-- my favorite is the Chicken Pot Pie. Also the \"low key\" ambience is interesting and something i can appreciate when trying to relax. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is all made from scratch. Their vegetarian/vegan portion of the menu is quite large. The prices for the food are average. I'm a sucker for restaurants with good food and beer which is exactly what Cornish Pasty is."}
{"text":"When people talk about heaven on earth, be aware...they are discussing the Cornish Pasty Co.  This place is A-MA-ZING...oh yes, it must be sounded out.  I had friends in town from San Fransisco and they surfed Yelp to find a good place to eat in Phoenix...Cornish Pasty Co sounded awesome...and totally lived up to our expectations.  So much so that after eating there one night, we returned the night after for another round!  We sampled quite a few things from their menu...the Royale with Cheese was badass, the Chicken Alfredo pleasant, the Cajun wickedly delicious and spicy...and don't forget the Pilgrim, which is like having Thanksgiving bundled up and delivered to you in a wonderfully delicious pasty package.  AND the portions are big enough that you can eat half and be full, so the goodness can be enjoyed as a heated up lunch the next day!  BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!  We couldn't resist dessert...  Night One:  Banoffee Pie.  Thick layer of graham cracker, wickedly thick layer of RICH caramel, a spattering of banana slices and then fresh whipped cream.  FREAKIN AWESOME.  AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!!!  Night Two:  Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty.  Imagine amazing pastry smothered in chunky peanut butter, drizzled with raspberry jelly and encasing bananas...now top that with some more pastry, more jelly and whipped cream...not the sickening sweet shit that comes in cans...fresh, cool awesomeness disguised as a white blob.  THIS is the amazing Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty...God's gift to man.    My advice...SEEK OUT CORNISH PASTY CO, ALL YE FOOD LOVERS!!!  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food service and atmosphere.   1st Time here.  Wife loved the Chicken Tikka masala Pasty Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love going to the Cornish Pasty location on Dobson and Guadalupe for an indulgent pastie and a glass of wine.  The last time we were there we sat up at the bar and watched the food prep. It was quite a production of sputtering sauces, fillings and rolling of dough.  The vibe is upbeat. Who needs sports screens on all sides of the room-- food, wine, and thee is enough."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I had no clue what a \"Pasty\" was before a friend took me here. Much to my delight, it's just a really good Hot Pocket (no offense, Cornish Pasty)!   This place is pretty cool... it has phenomenal food and a really cool and relaxed vibe. I'm not a beer guy personally, but they seemed to have a pretty good selection to choose from. They also have a ton of different pasty options to pick from and my favorite (up to this point) is probably the Italian. They also have a good selection of salads and soups on the menu too.  I definitely recommend checking this place out of you have never been here or if you're a fan of really good Hot Pockets (again, no offense to Cornish Pasty Co.)."}
{"text":"Spectacular peppered steak and Stilton pastie, great service and, well, finding pasties in a Las Vegas strip mall was the best thing that happened last weekend.  They also have dry blackthorn cider on tap, which for a somerset boy like me is perfect.  If there was one of these in the Bay Area I'd pretty much live there. My mouth is watering just writing this review..."}
{"text":"Excellent! They have so many different flavors that it's hard to choose. Also, they have lots of vegetarian options, which I love. I can usually find something I can eat pretty much anywhere."}
{"text":"I know I'm in the minority by rating this place so low but I did not enjoy my experience here. I've been here twice and both times felt uncomfortable by the service. I wasn't sure if it was seat yourself or if I should wait for a hostess. I came in, looked confused and was welcomed by an annoyed face and gesture by a cook. Overall, it was a dark, confusing and unwelcoming place. The food was fine but not enough to balance out the rude service."}
{"text":"TL;DR: A novelty concept (just selling pasties) turned into surprisingly well-fleshed out restaurant and bar--a huge selection of food in a great environment!  Absolutely delightful.  An entire restaurant that serves pasties. F*** yeah.  Came in--must have been a side door or something, by accident--to a dimly lit, long skinny room with tiny tiny booths along the wall.  Almost seemed to have a punk rock vibe going on.  Sat down, checked out the menu, found two pages of different pasties to choose from, almost all of them tempting choices.  Ordered the lamb and mint, and on a whim, poked my head into a doorway off what I thought was the main room.  This place is HUGE, and it looked like what I thought was the main room was actually just a little alcove.  There was a full bar, and LOADS of seats.  The food came, and it was delicious.  Filling, hearty, tasty--everything a good pasty should be.  Wish I lived here so I could try out more of the selection!  UPDATE: Returned and got the English breakfast and lamb vindaloo pasties. Keep the English breakfast, ditch the vindaloo!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night, but this just didn't do it for me. Dropped in, no one to seat me, figured I'd seat myself. Waited 5 minutes for a server to say hi and offer me a drink, another 15 to get some water and get my order taken. The server didn't know which Vegan Pasties were available that night so she checked, it was only the Vegan Greek Pasty (the menu stated at least two available on any given night). As a vegan, that was my option, so that I got (with a side of chips).   A good twenty minutes later everything comes out. The pasty was ok at first, full of sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. About halfway through I bite into a huge chunk of Mozarella (not vegan) and put the rest down. The only vegan option available that night was in fact not vegan. Really guys? At least the chips were ok.  Waited a good twenty minutes after I was clearly done eating before my server offered a check and to-go box. Overall the service was extremely slow and inconsiderate (I didn't really feel welcome), the vegan food wasn't vegan, and I still paid $15.00 for what amounted to a sandwich and fries. Maybe it was an off night, and I know a lone customer isn't a top priority, but I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Yes please!  Again, on business travel my boss and I went here right after landing at 10pm on a Monday night.  I was starving and tired and this place was awesome!  Total dive, great beers on tap, and the pasty are phenomenal.  Hot pockets on steroids!  Great variety; vegetarian, Indian masala, chicken pot pie, cheese steak.  Total guy place if you ask me - but plenty of ladies inside :)  You eat with your hands, the beers are enormous and it looks like it frat house inside.  I will be going back to the Cornish Pasty every time I come to Tempe."}
{"text":"Delicious. These pasty things are fun and yummy and there are a ton to choose from. The sides are big enough for two people to share and the signature pudding dessert thingy is a must. Damn good. Can't wait to go back.  (Minus one star for slow and indifferent service on our second visit.)"}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this location and haven't done a new review in a couple of year so, to start the new year, let me just say that the Cornish Pasty Company is still a great place to go have a delicious pasty and some suds. They have a nice collection on tap and even more beers, I believe, in the bottle. I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.  My favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:  The Peppered Steak The Greek (vegetarian)  I'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This is an awesome diamond in the rough and worth the trip every time.  In fact, just the mere thought has me drooling and thinking of making a trip there.    I have been to both locations - this one and the one out in Mesa.  Although the one is Mesa is closer to my house and the food the same quality, I prefer the ambiance of this one better so my husband and I always try to stop by when in the area.    I'l admit I'm not very adventurous when eating new things at times.  I find a favorite and stick to it.  I have tried about 5 different pasties but my favorites I always come back to are the Oggie and Chicken Pot Pie.  Their soups are also wonderful.  The potato leek is very hearty and filling but the Mushroom, Walnut and Spinach was a wonderful surprise.  I would never have tried it because it seemed and odd mix of flavors but I saw an episode of \"Check Please AZ\" where this soup was raved about so I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  The complexity of flavors was out of this world.  A huge beer and a warm pasty, the casual atmosphere and aroma of the mouth watering red wine gravy all blend into a wonderful dining experience.  For the value and the quality this is a \"must try\" for everyone."}
{"text":"Got addicted to these while in England, this place is the real deal. One of the few places I have found that can make a proper shepherds pie. My GF had the Guinness stew, also excellent. I am going back to try the mint lamb. All the crusts have been flaky and cooked to perfection. Warning, we almost drove by thinking the place was closed, when you step inside its like a pocket dimension. Looks tiny on the outside but is really a large place with a nice patio. They have a large tap selection for those like me who like trying draft from all over."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! You can't go wrong with any of the pasties. I also love the mushroom walnut soup. It's a great place for groups."}
{"text":"This place has expanded and that is great news because it is a must go.  I have tried many of the pasties and everyone is delicious.  The beer is great along with the irish car bomb special.  The atmosphere is great but the food and the beer is the reason why I continue to come back.    Another suggestion would be to try to soup.  It is a secret bonus."}
{"text":"Any good city has places well-suited for kicking off a great night. Cornish Pasty is one of those places.  With so many filling options (meat-and-potatoes for the all-American, East Indian cuisine for the globetrotter, eggplant for the vegetarian), all your friends can find pasties they like. And the $3 Car Bombs are tasty and potent.  As a take-home option, Cornish Pasty offers discounted half-baked pasties you can finish at home. But I prefer to sit at the bar, have a few drinks and watch the cooks prepare pasties from ultra-fresh ingredients.  Note: Seating is limited at this location, so be prepared to wait or go during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"It's kind of hard to give a place a 5 star rating on simply one visit, but this place deserves it! Besides having a pretty good beer selection, their food is amazing. I couldn't think of anything to knock about Cornish Pasty. Great food, great service by very enthusiastic employees, and a very good beer selection. What more can one ask for? I will be back on this trip, and any time work sends me to Phoenix."}
{"text":"3 DOLLAR CAR BOMBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh i wish i live in AZ right now.....  when we first got there and i saw the outside of the place i was like 'really..........?' don't get fooled by the apparence! step in and you will not regret!!!!   we shared a carne adovada, lovely bit a salmon, cheese steak, and chicken tikka masala... oh they are ALL soooooo good!!! (my favorite would be the carne adovada and the chicken masala!!!!!)  the banoffee pie was a prefect ending to our meal.... & another car bomb! oh i wish i live in AZ again!!!!!!!!  what diet?"}
{"text":"Wow! Who knew a neighborhood gem could pop up in Commercial Center?!!  Upon a recommendation from another business, I went with my date.  We are a bit adventurous but had no idea how awesome this place could be.  Commercial Center is a very diverse plaza, and it is deceiving from the outside of the restaurant as to what to expect.  When you enter, it is indeed a totally different experience.  The menu has something for everyone - including vegan and vegetarian.  We had the Spinach, Mushroom, and Walnut Soup which was absolutely amazing.  The curried potatoes were also very good.  It took me a few moments to realize most of the items are, indeed, served inside the tasty pastry.  The eggplant parmesan pasty was definitely better than any eggplant parmesan I have had.  The Caesar pasty was also very good.  We ended with a peanut butter and jelly pasty ... mmm!    A very nice selection of beers and very comfortable place.  By the time we left, the place was packed!  And for the amount of food, the check was very modest.  Service was great, despite the busy night.  I am going back again and bringing more friends!"}
{"text":"I mean its a gourmet hot pocket place. Hipsters plague and ruin this place but the 4 stars is because some things on the menu aren't great while others really shine. There is some definite inconsistency in the vibrance of flavor across the menu. Drunk me gives this a 5/5 though."}
{"text":"If you like English food this place is great. From an American's point of view the food is average. The funky location in the Commercial Center with a very low key exterior made the outing interesting and adds to the appeal.If you have not had an English Pasty before it is basically a Pot Pie without the pot. Service was great and the draft beer was really cold (as opposed to the English tradition). My English wife had a traditional Pasty and reported it was very high quality and authentic. I tried the red Curry pasty and it was fine but  was constantly reminded by the photos on the wall that a \"pasty\" is basic food intended for coal miners.This is a good place to visit if you are looking for a working class English pub experience."}
{"text":"This is a must try. It was very loud. After trying to yell at each other, we gave up on talking. There was a live band and a special event. The scotch egg was yummy. I had the Ruben and hubby had the spicy lamb. They were so full of flavor. It's a place we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty never fails to disappoint. I love that they have lots of vegetarian options and even a couple vegan options! They have a great beer selection as well and super cheap Irish car-bombs (my favorite) during their happy hour. The staff is always super friendly and on top of things. I'm so happy a place like this exists!!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, the mining theme is hard to ignore. There's a long bar on the left, a long row of tables on the right, the decor is black, and the photos are all of early 20th century Cornish miners hard at work. It felt a bit like dining in a mineshaft, which seems to be the place to munch on Cornish Pasties.  We stopped by here on our way out of Phoenix back to CA, lured by the proximity to our hotel and the good reviews.  The pasties are substantial - my wife only finished half of hers. There's a variety of fillings - I had the bangers and mash, my wife an Indian curry. Both were tasty if a bit salty. We stayed full most of the trip back to the coast.  The server was friendly and efficient; our drinks never reached bottom before being refilled.  We'll likely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I loved the overall vibe of this place as well as the service, and of course the food. Actually, let me reitorrate how awesome the food was. I am a vegetarian. Typically this means I go to a restaurant and I have one or two options; not here! There was an entire page of delicious things for me to choose from. We also had their strawberry meringue dessert and it was a perfect, light, refreshing treat to combat the hot weather."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 10 if there was one. The taste of this food, and the English Pub feel of the place captured my heart! :) It's dark inside, and they were playing punk rock, and other rock in that same sort of vein.  I ate at the bar. The bar tender is happy to make recommendations. For beer I had a 14 oz Bitburger, and then a 14 oz Kronenburg 1664. Both were cold and refreshing.   My appetizer was the crispy and flavorful scotch egg. It's a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage with a fried outer crust.   My meal was the bangers & mash pasty. This must be what they serve up in heaven. It's a golden pastry filled with pork, sage sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes. It comes with a side of red wine gravy. Un effing believable!  Finished my meal with a nice neat 12 year scotch. And I'm in love."}
{"text":"What a strange night at Cornish Pasty.  The service was superb so I tipped 37%, and while I ate I heard some great Johnny Cash, Waylon and Neil Young over the restaurant speakers.  I also heard a woman at a nearby table say, \"That is the most disgusting bathroom I've ever seen in a restaurant.\"  I wanted to just sip and chill for awhile after dinner, and I joked with two servers that they should now switch and play Led Zeppelin.  15 seconds later two things happened:  the country music playing was increased dramaticlly in volume (I was amused---did I do that?), and I now felt cold air conditioning blowing on the back of my neck (I was less amused since it was 10pm and prior to this the heat had been on all night since it is January).  I now had my hoodie on over my head as the AC poured down upon me for the next 30 minutes, then I exited, wondering which hamfisted manager makes such decisions, and why."}
{"text":"My wife and I were headed to another restaurant when I spotted the sign and made a quick u-turn.  The restaurant had reopened at this location the day prior and it was obvious the move was a work-in-progress. We were seated at a long table on church pews.   A wide variety of pasties are offered with us deciding to share one filled with lamb, mint, potatoes, rutabaga, and onion that was accompanied by a side of red wine gravy.  The pasties are prepared in batches and then baked to order.  We found the shell was flaky with an ample filling that was complimented by the gravy. This proved to be a more than satisfying lite lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced, the staff is amazing with great customer service, and they have great beers on tap as well as a nice selection of wine.   The interior is comfortable with large farm style tables for groups.    I frequent this place at least once a week - it is that good!"}
{"text":"Just got in from CPC, and had a great time!  Our server was great, and she got us started right away with drinks. This time around, I got the cajun chicken, J. got the chicken asiago, and S. got the chicken alfredo. I was super pleased with my pasty (past-ee), the chipotle added a great kick, oh and I got a side of garlic mashed potatoes that are bomb.   *insert $3 irish car bombs*  after chatting it up a bit, J decided he wanted dessert and after asking the server which was her favorite, we got the Shirley's Favorite, which is some sort of cake baked in a cast iron pot, served with ice cream, with was muy delish.   All in all, it was a good time had at CPC."}
{"text":"There probably isn't much left to be said about the awesomeness that is The Cornish Pasty Co. in Tempe, so I'll keep this brief. I'm a HUGE fan of the Cajun, it is absolute perfection with an amazing chipotle sauce that is the perfect compliment. Since I started going here, I've also come to enjoy starting off my meal with their garlic roasted potatoes (great to share with a friend). I've also tried the meat & cheese, which was great even though despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of sausage unless it's in a patty and comes next to some eggs and pancakes. Had a bite of the Italian as well, quite tasty in it's own right, although I picked out the big chunkier tomato, just a personal preference.  If the Tempe location is a bit cramped for you, and it DOES get pretty hectic in there sometimes, there's always their Mesa location which stays true to the formula but offers more seating room if you choose to dine in.   Don't make the mistake of not trying CPC at least once, I've introduced many friends (and even my parents) to this spot, and I've never gotten a single complaint. There is enough diversity on this menu that you can find someething for just about any range of tastes...hands down one of the most obvious 5 star reviews I've given."}
{"text":"Once we figured out which door to walk in through, the rest was pretty good.  If you do not mind the loud noise and the low lighting, the food and service is decent. While we all liked our food, there were quite a few issues/missteps that prevented this from being a higher rated review:  - The pasties seem to be all premade, as we had no options to remove even a single simple ingredient on two items from our 6 ordered.  The waitress told us that all are \"partially baked\".  - My son asked if the Mexican was spicy and he was told only mildly.  Well that's all relative and even for a kid that knocks off chorizo and hot wings without an issue; found it on the spicy side.  - Wife's came with an option for sauce; she said BBQ and got 1000 island.  - \"Chips\" came out soggy  Overall the food was decent and the portions on the large side.  I just wished they did a better job on putting it all together.  That said, we would come back here again to give them another try when we are in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely Yummy! I have convinced non-experimental eaters to even try this place.  They are convinced this is pretty dang good too!  My husband and I usually get a couple pasties to go and because we can never decide which is best, we usually end up trading off half way through.  The only downside to this place is that there is no delivery!  I would place orders here for lunch more often if there was!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm impressed.  I had never tried \"British\" food and when it was explained to me that the Pasties are like gourmet hot pockets I was not looking forward to trying it. I was actually very scared but since everyone else was onboard I thought I would try them out. I tried out the Portable Chicken pasties and was very happy with my selection.   It turns out they are somewhat like a gourmet hot pocket or calzone. The listed ingredients are baked inside and the outside is a bread crust. All the pasties come with a dipping sauce that just adds to the yumminess. I have eaten at the restaurant (Tempe location) and also placed a large order for work and both were a great experience with excellent customer service.  This place is so good I will continue to order month end lunches from here.   Food- Excellent Service- Excellent, owner very nice and friendly Establishment- good parking but get's very busy. The only off thing is that it is very dark inside the restaurant for some reason they have dark curtains covering every window."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service is generally fantastic.  I recommend either the Peppered stake, Carne or the eggplant if your vegetarian. Beer is good, the water is filtered (not everyplace on mill does this).  I really can't complain. It's a hometown spot for sure. Props to the owner of this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.    The main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1  The second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.    The crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo.   Give it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy."}
{"text":"I cannot say ENOUGH good things about this place. The patio, the service, the food, the atmosphere... Awesome awesome awesome. I had the Veggie Cubano  and my friends all love the mushroom walnut soup. I would definitely go back, and I highly recommend this rad pasty place."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 3 years now and it is one of my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix Metro. Now that they have expanded the restaurant I don't really have anything negative to say about the place at all. Their food is fantastic, the atmosphere is laid back and the prices are very reasonable. I've tried several of the Pasties and while they are all fantastic my favorite is the Lamb vindaloo. If you haven't been here yet it is a must try!"}
{"text":"I order the Carne adovara as my first  Pasty and a salmon Caesar salad delicious!!!. Great and friendly wait staff who brewed a fresh pot of ice tea for my order.  Great eclectic vibe here. Open kitchen concept where you can see them make the pastys on behind the center bar.. I really like what they have done here. A rock restaurant feel.. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is open til midnight. Late night foodie here. And the food was pretty yummy. We had the chocolate ale bread pudding which was alright (good but not my cup of tea) but my friend said to try their toffee whichever it was dessert, so that is on my list for next time. The pasties are always really good and with beer you can't go wrong. Place is dimly lit, people working there are really cool, and whichever mood your in, you can't go wrong in a place like this."}
{"text":"Great food. I have been to 2 of their locations and they are always good. My favorite is the rosemary chicken. Awesome flavor. Sauce is the perfect match to go with that pasty."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've stopped by Cornish Pasty, and...I have no idea why.  I could say I haven't been in the neighborhood as much, or that their lights are a little too dim for my liking, but those are nothing but excuses and as I write this review on an empty stomach, my mouth is watering at the thought of these pasties.  I think I know what we're having for dinner.  The menu and dining area have grown since the last time I had dined here.  It's no longer small and cozy, but a lot roomier but still holds the cozy vibe that I love.  Unfortunately, that involves the dimly lit room, but I always order more or less the same thing anyway and there's always the light from my phone if I needed to read the menu.  The pasties, needless to say, are delicious.  Think of something along the lines of a chicken pot pie, but shaped like a calzone.  And tastes way better.  You'll have to try them for yourself - they do not disappoint.  They do have a variety of beers on tap too, and I would highly recommend pairing one with your pasty!"}
{"text":"Like seriously, this is an awesome British pub hangout! It is spacious, laidback, hipster friendly. Those dang pasties.....yummmm. Delicious, flaky, buttery pie dough wrapped around your favorite filling. They have so many to choose from....Steak, Chicken, Lamb, Meatball, Salmon..... It's hard to choose a favorite. It is packed inside and very filling. It is essentially the best Hot Pocket you have ever eaten. They had decent beer and drink selection. Also a couple pool tables. You can watch them make the pasties when you walk in! It smells so good as soon as you walk in. You can also order the pasties partially cooked to be brought home and baked in your home oven. This is my new downtown hangout!"}
{"text":"Excellent pasties!! This place is located inside the Commercial Center shopping plaza, in the center row of shops. The restaurant itself is very upscale inside, with a decent size bar inside.  The side of garlic mashed potatoes are a must have. They were large enough for 2 people, perfectly seasoned with little bits of skins in there, yum! The chicken tikka masala pasty was well seasoned and very spicy. The crust was a beautiful golden brown. The pricing here was very reasonable for the serving sizes as well. A great all around meal!"}
{"text":"My mother & I went as a recommendation from local Downtown Tattoo Artist Eric Ayala. Never having British food before we weren't sure what to expect. We previewed the menu online first. Website is super accessible & easy to use. Parking is located on the side of the building & was not hard to find a space. The atmosphere inside was perfect. We thought it was a bit dark in the back of the shop so we opted to sit in the front near the windows. When you first walk in you can see all chefs hand making the Pasties. Menus had LOTS of options to choose from. I had the Cottage Pie Pasty & my mum had The Pilgrim. Both were absolutely delicious. Very nice comfort food. Can't wait to be back. Will definitely revisit when the weather is cool & I'm looking for a hearty comfort food!!!"}
{"text":"I came back! I missed Sherly Temple's Pudding!!! The flavor still the same as the first time I ate! Awsome!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the new location. Went during a nice day so we sat outside. Finally a place where I can eat vegan and my boyfriend can eat meat. I only wish you could order more styles vegan. I really want to try so many ones!! Oh my at that vegan coleslaw was like crack I need that recipe. Oh and the womens bathroom I dunno why but I was in love with the floors and wallpaper."}
{"text":"Since my last review in 2008 I have probably been here 20+ times. The food is always top notch, but I have to say since the recent expansion the service has really suffered. On each of my last 3 visits it has taken over an hour to get my food. I am patient (especially when the food is so delicious) but the lack of concern from the servers is a bit much.   Last time I came in I ordered the tikka masala salad, now I know they may be busy, but over an hour for a salad is pretty poor service. The time before that I was served a cold pasty and you could tell it had sat for quite a while before making it to my table. Each time I pointed these things out and was met with blank stares or a passive \"we're working on it.\"  I think I will wait a couple of months before returning so they work out the kinks in their service. I still love the food, but I don't usually have 2 hours for lunch."}
{"text":"Most people measure their lives in important milestones - your first kiss, marriage, buying a home, the birth of a child, a big promotion. My own timeline merely has two distinct halves - the time before I ate at Cornish Pasty and the time after. Every memory, every experience, every relationship before I put that first savory bite of pasty in my mouth is merely a shade of everything afterwards.  What had I been doing with my life? Had I really tasted - really, truly tasted - food before? With the fervor of a religious convert I questioned everything I once thought I knew about the gastronomical experience. Some people might accuse me of hyperbole, but rest assured, they're either idiots or they've never actually eaten at Cornish Pasty.  I favor the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty. Think of an ideal Salmon dinner - complete with asparagus and rosemary potatoes - rolled up into a perfectly baked calzone-like dough crust and that's about what you're eating. Served with a mustard cream sauce, it's about the tastiest thing on which you'll ever put your filthy mouth.  If that weren't enough, there're about 100 other pasties that will make your taste buds weep for joy and then ask for more. But wait there's more, they have beer. More specifically, they have Guinness, which happens to be the perfect drinkable compliment to the pasty. Funny how that works, huh?  Enough talk, go get yourself to Cornish and have a life-changing experience. You can thank me later when I see you at the next Pasty Lovers Anonymous meeting."}
{"text":"Absolutely fucking amazing pasty! I had the Guinness stew pasty paired with a merlot and thebBoddington nitro beer. Delicious! I wish i can have it every day!!  I bloody love the vibe there. Awesome choice of metal music. The waiter was cool. There was some sort of handmade artist market thing in the back room that friday we were there."}
{"text":"Maybe this style of food is just not for me, but I found all the pasties (hahah sounds funny) plain and tasteless. I was really excited to try this place due to the overwhelming compliments and awesome reviews on Yelp. But we were all pretty disappointed.   We got the Oggie, Bangers and Mash, Lamb Vindaloo, and the Lovely Bit a Salmon. None of it really stood out and it was just too much breading and potatoes... On the flip side, all of their sauces were really good. Moreover, I usually love any kind of dessert but we got their Strawberry Pavola and it was weird and interesting.. but interesting in a bad way. The dessert looked pleasant but it was basically a mountain of whipped cream with strawberries, kiwi, grapes and syrup on it... uhm no thanks.  At least the service and the beer was good! But I guess the reputation about British food stands firm; bland and heavy."}
{"text":"Original location fully renovated and looking nice....please don't come so I can keep this gem to myself and regulars and plus 1's."}
{"text":"Great food great ambience. Great place to throw party for friends. The beers are really good and the service is also good"}
{"text":"My first time to this place that we stumbled on and oh my gosh, heaven! When we first entered into the restaurant in the middle of the day - It was very dark. I thought we were going to bar to drink some irish beers and I was about to turn around and go back out to see if this was the right place but, the chef immediately greeted us as if he knew \"Hi, come in - have a seat anywhere!\" The restaurant looks like a bar you could have fun during Happy Hour with friends after work - needed cold beers - YES! But, because it was during the work week and mid-day, we really wanted to try their cornish pastry dish. I'm so boring I stuck with the original \"Shepard's pie\" and my husband/I shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Absolutely, delicious. The Pastis (Pastry) was just so warm, flaky, buttery tasting, and just melts in your mouth after each bite. I probably could just eat the pastry all by itself - it's so good. The meal entree, I think it was a huge size for one person to eat but, as the history goes it was for feeding the miners, Lol! I didn't think I would be able to finish my entree but, surprisingly I did. I was super stuffed though but, my kane (husband) wanted dessert - so crazy! So we shared the toffee pudding - ohhh so glad we did. The toffee cake came in a  cute little cast iron bowl with melted toffee all over and nice vanilla ice cream on the side - we both ate it so fast, we didn't even blink and puff - was gone!  Our waitress was so nice and kept coming back to check in on us, filling up our waters, seeing how we were doing, and being amazing! Can't wait to go back again...Yummmy, I'm hungry already just writing about it! LoL"}
{"text":"I like this place for mainly the beers and atmosphere.  The original one in Tempe is the best, of course, but the others are pretty cool.  The food?  Well, I'm not the biggest fan of British inspired food but it has a very home cooked feel to it.  If you like calzones and such, you'd like pastys.  So far I've had the meat and cheese one, and the curry one.  Will make it back to try more."}
{"text":"We love Cornish Pasty, but are not thrilled with this location. I've been here a couple of times now (we usually go to the one in Mesa or Tempe) and both times the service was very slow, didn't really care that we were there ordering a decent amount of food and the food did not come out as hot as it does as other locations. That leads me to believe the server just didn't bring us our food right when it was ready. I had to get up and go find him to ask for a dessert and check.   We probably won't go back to this location because of the current wait staff but will definitely go to the other spots!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna get my one comaplint out quick. Service is slow and either thier system or servers are not well equipped for geoups over 3 doing split orders. Normally that would cause me to give a plave bad ratings however this place is just a staple the food is too good the beer options never disappoint. Could be a bit cleaner. But its faults don't out weigh its positives."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix unexpectedly for one night and needed a place close to our hotel to catch up with friends.  Based on Yelp recommendations tried Cornish Pasty.  Thankfully, we were able to sit outside where the noise level was much less than inside.  If you want to visit, don't come here on Friday night and sit inside!  Restaurant hard to find as there are no signs and windows covered in black curtains.  Pasties were excellent!  Didn't love the red gravy, but it was ok.  Had appetizers and salad and dessert, all very good and vegan or vegetarian friendly.  The chips (french fries) were delicious, although a smallish portion.  Four of us easily shared a full size garden salad.  I have not had a pavlova since visiting New Zealand 20 years ago and would come here just for that, it was fantastic.  All the desserts are huge too!  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is oh so good, great atmosphere and bar specials.  Sometimes they have live music.  great place to just chill or hang out with a group"}
{"text":"The pasty is a very interesting food. It's kinda like a calzone, sorta like a burrito, a bit like pot pie, but it's definitely it's own thing.  This restaurant is fantastic. I seriously enjoy coming here. I used to live down the street, as a matter of fact. The atmosphere is very mellow. The new expansion is very nicely done, although I do miss how charming it was before. If you're a craft beer person, you'll be at home here. On the busy nights, plan to spend a bit of time waiting for a table (the expansion has improved the wait time, though)."}
{"text":"This should be a 2 1/2 stars. Wish I could give it more.The pasties are good but not traditional. I found them a little over-spiced but the pastry was rich and flaky. Wish they offered a plain meat, chicken and pork gravy as the reductions and sauces just aren't complimentary to all flavors of pasties and pies. Husband got a chix pot pie, gravy tasted like there was vinegar in it although it was supposed to be \"thyme chix gravy\". He has an ulcer and it made him feel ill. In all fairness, I would eat there again as I feel they deserve another try. Service is excellent. Friendly, helpful and fast. For this alone, give them a try."}
{"text":"Good food but service is slow.  Did not really like my dessert of the Bread pudding.  it was dry and not very tasty.  I will for sure come back when the mood for a good Pasty."}
{"text":"We love the Scottsdale location because it is brighter but the good is great in both locations. We always bring family and friends with us and they all love it! It is fun to taste different kinds. My favorite is the one with turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and stuffing!"}
{"text":"Top 3 restaurants in Phoenix, nothing else can compare. I do wish they had more vegan options -- I'm a vegan because I dislike meat and cheese, why would I want fake cheese? I can't imagine anyone wanting that. Regardless, I pick around it and smile for days"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the pasties are delicious, but the service could be a little bit quicker. It's always busy so maybe they just need more employees to keep up with all the hungry customers."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley! Delicious food, comfortable atmosphere and late hours (serve food until midnight except for Sundays) is the reason my girlfriend and I frequent Cornish Pasty Co. The different kinds of pasties they offer are VERY diverse (anything from exotic flavors like the \"red curry chicken\" and \"lamb and mint\" to traditional flavors like \"italian\" and \"reuben\"). Of the 38+ flavors they offer, I have probably tried about 10 of them and haven't found one I didn't LOVE! I live 40 miles away form this location but never do I mind the drive, it's always worth it! I recommend the Carne Adovada and the Hibiscus tea is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my faves. This place is perfect! All pasty will be cooked to perfection and takes about 15 min. We come here about 1 a week. Great music and good beer complete your selection...  Ah, and if you have any space left, try the dessert... one mode delicious than the other!"}
{"text":"So I've been here 4 times now. And the most recent visit was the most disappointing. Service 3 out of the 4 times has been terribly slow and inattentive. I was suffering a cold so I opted just to try some soup this time around. I got a cup. The cups are extremely small for the cost. When the cup of soup arrived with two slices of bread, I asked my server for just an extra slice with which to finish off the soup. She didn't return until I was finished with my meal. She brought an entire plate of bread. I was surprised, since I only asked for a slice, but thought she was being nice since it took her so long. Plus I was eating with coworkers and I thought the extra bread was courtesy for the table. And yet I was surprised to find I was charged for the bread when I got the bill. It was labeled as a \"side of bread\" even though I only asked for an extra slice for my soup and she never mentioned the cost nor that she would bring me so much to count as a side. I really don't appreciate bad service and bad communication, considering the extra bread didn't even arrive until I was finished with my meal. Also, she could have mentioned she would charge it as a side. I ordered dessert in advance - so the bill wasn't small. This place seems to get more expensive than it's worth. I'm not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place but could have been a bit cleaner. Good food though. True moms and pops shop experience"}
{"text":"Small restaurant that serves all kinds of British pasties. Takes a while to get served though but the pasties are great. You can choose so many kinds. Don't take a big group here since it's a small place. Too bad there isn't another one in the Valley besides Tempe."}
{"text":"Got the Lamb Vindaloo and a beer. I love lamb, but I don't love spicy. It was a little spicy for me, but still delicious.   GET THE LEEK SOUP. Amazingggg."}
{"text":"Very unique menu, wonderful British fair! They have so many combos of them, and if you don't eat meat they have a great veggie part of their menu too! They have a ton of different import beers also."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will be returning for sure! Walking in you smell the dough baking. The kitchen is open at the front. The decor makes the atmosphere. Unique pieces everywhere you turn. The waitress was super nice and cool. Let's talk about the food! Amazing. I ordered the chicken Greek one! It was so hard to narrow down which one I wanted to try. My critique is a little less artichoke and more olives. I can't wait to come back and try another!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place isn't English at all. I went in tonight and sat at the bar for almost 20 mins and had no service. I eventually I gave up and left. This place felt like a locals only place and had a weird vibe. I know I won't go back."}
{"text":"The amount of times I've come to pasty and not gotten service within 30 minutes of being sat is inexcusable. Servers will literally make eye contact with me and continue to walk away. I am a server at a restaurant in town and can't believe that the people that work here are so clueless. The food is delicious, but not worth waiting 30 minutes on a night when the restaurant is dead in order to get greeted. To go is the way to go, but even then good luck getting a simple hello!"}
{"text":"I had the Italian.  My two lunch buddies had the Pesto Chicken and Reuben.  I tasted all and it was GOOD!  First time here, definitely not the last.  Bar type environment.  Spacious table seating.  In the commercial center on Sahara next to other food choices.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just went today with a few friends to have everyone try what I've been raving about since I've been to the location in az. This venue did not disappoint. Good service. Very friendly. The food was as delicious as I could remember. I had the Mexican. That is by far my favorite. If you have space after, the banofee pie is delicious. Definitely a must try if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cool spot! Checked it out early Saturday morning. The tomato soup was delicious. Also tried the fries, chipotle chicken pasty and Alfredo pasty. All were really good. Server was friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites, has the right mix of laid back ambiance, excellent beers and tasty food!"}
{"text":"\"It's pronounced pas-tee, pasties go on your nipples\" our server clarified for us.  We walked into a huge industrial looking building with a pool table and games and plenty of seating for groups and couples. The noise was a little loud but nothing out of the ordinary, and we were sat within a minute of waiting.  The alcohol selection was plenty and the food is strictly pasties with some soups and salads if that's not your thing. Plenty of vegetarian options as well.  I ordered the Mediterranean style pasty and it was a bit messy but tasted good, my fiancé got the royale which seemed a bit more traditional I think and tasted even better than mine.  He ordered the Hefeweizen beer and I had the jimtate, mine was okay but I'm a bit picky with mixed drinks and his beer was great.  Overall a good experience going, especially if you're looking for something different to try in the downtown arts district of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a must go to if your visiting Vegas.  The pastry used to envelop the food is like no other.  It's an upbeat crowd with amazing food.   The food can be described as comfort food.  Anyone in town for day or for a mini vacation don't leave without checking this place out.  My favorite is the meatloaf with mashed potatoes or the Shepard's pie  food heaven at its best.  If your a foodie you will not be disappointed.   Prices are so reasonable, servings are so huge two can easily eat.  Not that you will want to share.   I take all my guest to eat here, and no one is disappointed.  These guys ROCK!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Cornish Pasty Co since they opened, years and years ago. When they were still serving your pasty in a basket, cheap tables and chairs, no liquor license, you always saw the owner there working and the menu was so short.   Oh, how its grown, and I love it even more now. The new expansion is awesome! The beer they have on tap is fantastic, the staff is always welcoming and friendly! They've done such a great job. I recommend this place to everyone and I try to visit at least every couple months or so. Every time someone visits from out of town, I make sure to bring them there. If someone has never heard of it before, I tell them all about it. Many people have been pleased by going after I tell them about it! I've never heard any complaints. I only have 1 of my own, and its never stopped me from returning. I had one bad pasty, too much garlic. I can't say how many times I've visited, but its always been a very enjoyable experience. I will keep returning, keep talking them up and still bring in new visitors with me!!   I love the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, Pesto Chicken and Rosemary Chicken. I always want to try new ones, but I love getting the ones I know I already love! Oh, and you must try the banoffee pie! I'm not a sweets or dessert person, but oh my, it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Oh my!! From the service, beer selection, setting, the food, you cannot go wrong with this spot! I immediately felt like I had been transported to a hip English Pub the moment I walked through the door. Our sever Sean was on point from the start. Not simply asking what I wanted to drink, but going further to make sure I got something I would really enjoy. He brought me a few tasters to help me narrow my search. That's spot on service as far as I'm concerned.  The food: Awesome! We started with the Tandoori Wings and fell in love. I was torn between a few different pasty options and took Sean's suggestion to order the Royale With Cheese while the fiance ordered the Cubano. Both were perfection! I couldn't actually finish my pasty (I'm a pansy), but I'm looking forward to having it as a late night snack :) You have to visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"As a Michigan native, I've had plenty of pasties, but this place takes the pasty to a whole new level.  The dough is perfectly crisp and flakey, and there is a pasty to satisfy any taste.  A whole page of awesome vegetarian options too.  But don't stop with the pasty.  Their side dishes and soups are also delishious, and they have an excellent beer selection.    From the outside, you would not expect this place to be so unique.  They're tucked off University in a strip mall, and half the time they forget to turn their sign on.  Don't let that fool you, they hold pretty late hours.  And, they're always busy so if there's more than two of you, be prepared to wait for a table.  The atmosphere is very casual and unpretentious.  The waitstaff is very friendly, and I think there's a mustache requirement for the guys.  From a seat at the counter, you can watch the kitchen prepare your meal.  It's pretty impressive how they operate in such tight quarters without burning or stabbing eachother.    Bottom line, this place rocks."}
{"text":"Not a single complaint! Food is amazing.  The beer selection is beautiful, service is good & the aesthetic is pretty rad."}
{"text":"Delicious flaky pasties. Great downtown location - came here after seeing a show at Valley Bar. Appreciated that they were open late. They also have an extensive beer selection. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the Bangers and Mash and Guinness Stew pasties. They're big enough to share, unless you're a starved madman."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is such a great place to find your comfort food.  The pasty crust is like the perfect blend of a light pizza/pie crust browned to perfection.  Cornish pasty has fillings for every palate whether you prefer a spicy, or more traditional filling.  My personal favorite it the Carne Adovada...so good and served with salsa and sour cream.   Don't miss their mushroom walnut soup which is my favorite soup ever.  They make their bread fresh each day and it's amazing.  Tandoori wings and lots of beer choices make this a favorite go to place for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"Wow great pasties lived in England for three years theses are better. Love the Royal. Mick"}
{"text":"sooo...I finally got a chance to try this place. Its in the same mall as lotus of siam...the green door..the tranny bar and the 5 dollar crack head hooker stationed at the entrance to the mall.. Affectionately known to me as something for everyone mall. First thing is you better not have a larger then regular ass ,as they have these pretty cool seats but they are pre molded metal and if you have junk in the trunk your gonna be spilling out and uncomfortable.Other thing is that if your wearing shorts prepare for instant arctic butt and leg chill..the seats are cold. Again,as with most places in vegas they have ONE waitress serving a packed restaurant,this is a pet peeve of mine,its called SERVICE,if you track potential clients you should be able to gauge fairly well when the crowds will roll in,to not do that is just disrespectful to customers.Anyways....I ordered the leek and stilton soup for starters,I can only assume they make this to order because it took a good 20 minutes for it to come out. But,when it arrived I was very pleased,excellent soup and a side of nice bread,both very good and satisfying. I ordered the sheperds pie Pasty.Again if your in a rush forget it, I assume these are made fresh to order,it took about 40 minutes for it to arrive.But,if you plan on the extra time its definitely worth it,savory and satisfying,very good fresh food. My waitress was so overwhelmed that i just jumped up to the bar to get a refill on my coke. Honestly I don't blame the waitress for this lack of service I blame management for not properly staffing the restaurant.If the service had been proper this would without a doubt been a 5 star review. They also have a ton of beer choices. In summation I would return to this place the food was great,I just hope they address the staff issue,it was a bit frustrating,but in the end they made up for it with their delicious food."}
{"text":"have already been to the new location 3 times. same great food, same great beer, same great service, but, man, what a lay-out! three floors with a bar on each. pool tables, church pews, dim lighting, brick walls, 80s metal playing, beer flowing. wow-woah-weeeee. (i did that in a Christopher Walken voice)  typically, i am a str8 Oggie or Bangers and Mash type of guy with the occasional sprinkle of Shepard's pie. HOWEVER, new developments have occurred in my life. and just between you and me... wow-woah-weeee. I am talking about the Roast Dinner. order it. Roast Beef, potatoes, rutabaga. And then, just when you are lulled into a savory sense of security BAM that Ms. Candi Karat and Sir Sprout von Brussels come in and do a number on ya! bing bang BOOM! POW POW! YAWK YAWK YAWK YAWK.  excuse me. just go and i will stop embarrassing myself"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. Came here with three pals on a Saturday evening before a Sun Devils football game. Loved the food (I had the \"traditional Oggie\") and enjoyed a pint of cider on tap. Looking forward to bringing others here. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate diet killer!  All I can say is that the food here is different and it's awesome.  You simply have to experience it for yourself.  I've only eaten here twice because I am limiting myself to once a month.  I actually schedule eating at this place in my phone.  It's that good!"}
{"text":"Food is top notch but service is a tad slow and disorganized. Anywhere I can get a speckled hen pint and a pasty is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"different unique and fun, met a friend for lunch  had side salad, shared the fries garlic style and the huge Shepard Pie Pasty."}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE with Cornish Pasty Co!  If you've never had a pasty (pass-tee) before, picture a big pocket made from buttery-flaky crust and filled with your heart's desire!  They have nearly a dozen delicious, vegetarian pasties to choose from!  I love the Veggie Oggie filled with veggie-steak, potatoes, rutabaga and onions.  Mmmmm!  Pre-order 45 minutes before hand and they'll custom make you a vegan one!  My only complaint?  Since the place is so small it can really heat up because of the ovens.  Be prepared, it can get pretty hot in there!"}
{"text":"Soooo tasty! I am sold on the cajun pasty! Service was ok, I think the pasties take a really long time to bake, but they are worth the wait.  Wish I lived closer to it!"}
{"text":"Had a couple friends highly recommend this place. Great atmosphere and fantastic food! I had the Carne Adovada and it was DELICIOUS! The food came fast as well. My friends and I were very pleased"}
{"text":"If you've ever thought to yourself, \"yeah, light lunch...that's stupid, I'm starving.\" then Cornish Pasty will be your friend.  It's a cozy, low-key joint with the most comfortable church pews I've ever sat in, a great beer selection, and an extensive menu of Pasty's that all look absolutely amazing. I've tried about 7 different kinds, and my favorite is the pretty traditional Sheperd's Pie, which is ridiculously good.  The crust is light and buttery and delicious, and the fillings are always amazing. They also have a ton of vegetarian options, which I have not tried, but one of my Veggie Co-workers waxed Rhapsodic over. Apparently it's hard to do vegetarian Chicken pot pie?   Deserts are crazy good, as long as you don't mind a sugar/cream coma. I'm personally a huge fan of the Puddings, both Sticky Toffee and Chocolate bread. ooohh, so good.  Pros: - Really good prices for the food you get, friendly staff, and unless they are totally packed, a very quick lunch spot. - Puddingsssssss. - If you like playing menu pokemon, it will take you at least a solid month of coming every day to catch em all, and so far, 7 in, they are all delicious. - Easy parking - I think staff picks the music, and it's usually pretty awesome.  Cons; - I don't even want to know the calorie count.  - Nearly impossible to Not Get Desert."}
{"text":"This was truly a surprise. I read the reviews and decide to give it a try and I am happy that I did. The restaurant is hidden and very unwelcoming being surrounded by so many other bars and restaurants. The inside is dark and small but the food makes up for all the down falls. The menu has so many to choice from it difficult to decide what to eat."}
{"text":"First time at the downtown location and we loved it.. it feels like it's been there forever .. that old world charm.  We chose to sit upstairs in the black leather love seat chairs by the bar.. the bartender brought us menus and when the guys couldn't decide on which beer to have he brought them samples.. awesome service!!   From our seats we could see the pastys being made.. they sure make it look easy..   I ordered the chicken pot pie.. it was delish.. that pastry crust is perfect with the veggie, chicken & gravy filing. We shared the garlic roasted potatoes, also very good!   We'll be back to enjoy a drink and some pool.. and make our way through the menu. Lots of vegetarian & vegan options."}
{"text":"Got the Pilgrim, Turkey fresh off the bird, sweet potatoes, stuffing, grilled onions. Side of red wine gravy and a cup of cranberry sauce. Even John Wayne himself would be proud of this pasty, pilgrim! Place has cool vibe and I will be back"}
{"text":"You know sometimes you find these hidden places and it's just like really where was this hiding all my life. I had to search for it but found it and was well worth it. I had the scotch egg and the original pasty, I think it was called the oogie. Pastry was crispy and sauce was delightful. Scotch egg was nice because you don't see those anywhere. I like these places because they are so different and you don't really find anything like this here in Vegas. I would definitely recommend searching it out because it's worth the find. The food is tasty and the beer selection is interesting also. Will be back soon. Thank you for a great lunch."}
{"text":"I finally made it here after promising myself forever that I would try this place.  I have to say, I liked it!  Upon entering, the place was pretty small and narrow.  It's almost like a long hallway.  To the left, theres bar seating, with some really high chairs-thats where I sat.  To the right, against the wall, theres some tables for two lined down the side.  In the back, there seems to be a set of larger tables for bigger parties.  The place is kind of drab and dark.  Not what I had expected.  Dark tile, dimly lit.  The kitchen area is immediately behind the bar, and you can watch the people work as they make your food.   The staff here seems to be a younger crowd, early 20's.  Kind of hippie-ish, but in a good way.  They all seem to work really well together.  I kind of got a student feel when I was in there.  When I sat at the bar, I was greeted immediately by a really nice guy, who offered me a menu and asked if I needed any help.  The menu is really large, with a nice variety of pasties to choose from.  I got the Philly steak pastie, and it was really good!  I think they make it fresh when you order, which I loved.  The servings here are large, and I was unable to finish my entire pastie, so please remember that when ordering.  Aside from a minimal wait, I had a decent experience.  I didn't care for the dark n drab decor, but overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great pasties! The food is good and the beer selection is excellent as well. The indoor seating area is a cool dark communal seating section, and the music is usually British punk or hard rock, which is sweet."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere with a variety of music. I tried the spanikopita and the rosemary steak pasties and there were very good and paired with good dipping options.  Im giving 4 stars because service severely lacked. We we're passed by several times and only offered refills when we we're clearly irritated. It could just be an off day because it's a slow Sunday morning and they maybe just aren't on the ball as usual. I'll try it again when it's busier and hopefully service will be better. There are pool tables and dart boards and soon will have a pool tournament so there seems to be a fun vibe and effort to be than a standard downtown restaurant which I can appreciate."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Yummy draft beers & delicious pastys. I like how many vegetarian options they have! I don't feel left out at all coming here with my meat eating friends. The Greek pasty is my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"first time here just before heading to the airport so I wanted something filling. cool waitress - my first pick the Cajun chicken was out. ordered the Reuben pasty. that hit the spot! so it's different from a Reuben - no bread but the crust is good. the sauerkraut isn't as tangy as I like, but maybe that's the way the Brits eat? the meat was tender and more cube like.   it's got the ambience of a dive bar haha.thats cool. I'm sitting at a small table for 2 with dim red lighting and heavy metal playing across from the kitchen. first thing I noticed was the heavy smell of curry! interesting since this is clearly not an Indian restaurant.  got the banofee pie - it's kinda like a banana cream pie with graham crust."}
{"text":"It's dark, loud, and to be fair, sometimes the service is a bit shoddy, but the food is absolutely wonderful. The Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. This is the place I take my family or other visitors when they come to see me in Tempe. The pasties are absolutely one of a kind, with a taste you can't get anywhere else. I'd recommend the more traditional English types, by the way. Some of the weirder pastry flavors taste like merely their constituent parts: eg the lamb vindaloo just tastes like lamb vindaloo in a pastry. However the 'Oggie' or the pork with apples, they transcend their own ingredients like King Arthur riding a spectral dragon of flavor, reminding you of foggy London streets and rolling green hills of sheep!"}
{"text":"This place had been highly recommended and my Mom, sister and I went there tonight. The waitress had an attitude from the moment we got there. It was very noisy and the music they played unless you are a heavy metal rocker was not pleasant to eat while listening. We ordered, it took the food 20 minutes to get there. There was a mix up and the waitress comes by to let us know she had ordered my food wrong and they were preparing it. She then asked if I would like a side salad, and I said yes. My Mom and sister were done when my food arrived. The waitress never came back to check on us, and then cleaned up the plates from my Mom and sister. I felt rushed. She finally came back and brought our check, to which I asked if she comped mine, to which she said no, she comped me a salad. After I asked for it to be.comped, she stormed off shaking her head. She never did ask how our food was and she overall was extemely rude.  The food was ok, however, the service was horrible!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Beer selection is great too. Sat at the bar very friendly and attentive staff"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I wish we had a pasty place where I live!  I came here randomly on a whim, and was not disappointed.  It's amazing how many flavors of filling they have here, and from what I tried, all were great!  I loved the lamb vindaloo and the accompanying yogurt sauce.  Delicious.  My friend got the original pasty, and this was also good-- perfect for people who have a mellower palate.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, people seem to love to work here, and they also love their facial hair-- our server was rockin a great hipster moustache.  Servings are generous, service is excellent, parking is easy.  I would love to come back here again someday."}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome!. Great customer service and awesome food!  The pastry chef I don't know his name but he's one cool dude."}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing. My daughter and I split an order of The Most Garlicky Fries on the Planet and each got a pasty. Mine was the Bangers and Mash and hers the Chicken Portobello. Two people could easily split one. It's just wonderful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"cant go wrong ! plus 3 dollar car bombs"}
{"text":"Glad I gave this place a second try . The atmosphere is dark like a coal mine on the smaller side  of the restaurant and we   went with a good appetite and was famished by the time the food got to us even though  we watched them make it right in front of us .( watching prolly didn't help, and it was during a busy time at night when all the night people are out  )  But the service and the  food are goood !! I Loved my  second try pasty !! I got the chicken pot pie and only slightly regretted it after trying a bit of my husbands which for the life of me I can't remember the name of .. . the  filling is hot and not soupy   (which was a pleasant surprise)  the pasty   crust is flaky thick and made to perfection-and i'm picky about pastry  pie type crusts . the apple  caramel pasty was like heaven and after a whole pasty each then the apple caramel  my husband and I had a hard time polishing it off  each of our halves  of it but it was delicious ! being skinny very hungry big eaters is quite a feat !  when we lived literally next door I wanted to see what the hype was about cause every night it was super busy ,so my husband tried to surprise me with a pasty the first time I wasn't a big fan it was the lamb with min combo and i just didn't like it at all .I'm not a crazy fan of the dark cave like decor or the loud music either .. just not my scene .  But if I want good comfort food I'll once in a while I'll order to go . the price is a bit too high( for  people on a budget to eat here often )   but the food was so good i found it  makes it worth the price .we spent around $24+ for just two people ...  ."}
{"text":"When I saw the name \"Cornish Pasty\" I immediately felt like I needed a peasant dress and a goose following me around in order to visit this establishment. Boy was I wrong; I fit right in with my ripped jeans, straight bangs and tattoos!! The people at this place rawk. (yes, I actually typed the word \"rawk\")  Anywho, this place is absolutely amazing. They have a whole entire page of veggie creations that make me salivate just thinking about them! I have had the Veggie Mexican (by far the best IMO), the potato and onion and the cottage somethingorother... and oh brother, I loved them all.  I think that the small dining space, worn seats at the bar and the fact that you can see your food being prepared adds to the experience.  My only complaint is that it takes a bit to get your food, but they fill your drinks while you are waiting, so I can deal with it.   They also have Irish Car Bombs. Very cool. Very, very cool."}
{"text":"I never bothered going out of my way to Tempe since I knew this would open here. It just took forever! Like YEARS of anticipation. So...does it live up to the hype? Yeah, kinda, enough to be a happy return customer.   CPC's draw is an abundance of stuffed pastries that give diners dozens of choices. They range from the traditional, with stuff like roast beef or hamburger with gravy. But that's a snooze. I like the southwestern varieties like Cajun Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, and even their vegan meals, which I believe was some type of veggie vindaloo. My only complaint: the slightly sweet dough tries to be one-size fits all, but misses the mark. There's something about the bread that can work great with chicken and peppers, but can totally miss when fused with other styles of cuisine. It's not a big deal.  They're all much more filling than they appear. There's something for everyone. It's good. Whatever you order, start of with their wings. They are *huge*, the 'HP sauce' is delicious, and I just can't get enough of the Stilton sauce. My friend swears by the pate if that's your thing.  Aside from dining, keep in mind there are 3 floors, so it shouldn't be tough finding seating. The basement and second floor have a dive-y feel to them, which is good for socializing when Seamus and Valley Bar are just too loud for ya. To make things better, there's a limited cocktail menu, and a formidable assortment of roughly two dozen beers. You'll need them, as it seems impossible to bring anything out of the kitchen in under a half hour.   Overall, I'm just not seeing a reason to avoid this spot despite a couple of faults. It's one of those few restaurants you can take everyone to, and have your entire group at least content. It's that sort of reliability, along with variety, that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I think they filmed Hostel here....glad I didn't loose my life though!  https://youtu.be/DLxonzr9Iew?t=9s"}
{"text":"So, I came in here early for First Friday, because I have eaten at several other locations in the past, and was craving some comfort food.  I made sure to come early to avoid a long wait.    When I walked in, around 5:00 on Friday, the place was at most 1/4 full.  I decided to sit back in the bar area, as I was by myself.  I ordered my glass of wine and water pretty quickly, but it took almost 15 minutes to get the wine.  I was told, \"sorry for the wait.  They are a bit backed up.\"  My thought was:  If it's taking this long now, what about when First Friday really gets hopping?    My server didn't take my food order until the wine was brought, and I ordered the chicken greek pasty and a side of roasted potatoes.    After this, I saw no server at all for 20 mins.  She brought my side of potatoes by itself.  No pasty.  I went ahead and ate them, because if I waited they would have gotten cold.  About 12 mins later my pasty was brought.    Don't get me wrong, the pasty is delicious.  It just seems pretty unorganized and messed up for an event like tonight.    The servers were nice, though not terribly attentive.   Took a bit to get my check paid also, which was frustrating."}
{"text":"Food is the same but this location has greatly expanded.  Although it still gets crowded sometimes, you can now come at 6:00 on weekdays and probably get a seat.  I was a bit concerned however about the outside area which is poorly maintained and dirty.   I know it's outside, but you can still clean tables get the splinters out of the wooden seating.  Are the portions a bit smaller?  If so, all to the good.  This still has a college handout ambiance but most of the patrons are not college students, so perhaps Cornish Pasty could encourage their servers to dress just a bit nicer and act a bit nicer."}
{"text":"Oh my f*ing God.  I don't have enough good things to say about this place! !! The food here is fantastic!  My boyfriend and I always start of with the oven Frys with jalapeños and garlic.  You can't go wrong with anything off the menu, my favorites are the chicken pot pie,  salmon,  and shepherds pie."}
{"text":"Kudos. You are consistently amazing. Had the Ploughman's platter for dinner last night....and lunch today. Highly recommend it & any of your pasties. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.  My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey.   I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place."}
{"text":"If I could marry a Pasty, I would.   I love this place. They even have some gluten free options on the menu so I can bring my husband along. Great beer list, nice vibe and ambiance."}
{"text":"This is our families newest favorite.  Love the pastys!  We try a new flavor every visit.  The beer menu is awesome too!  3 valley locations.  Find one!!"}
{"text":"Terrible location, AC was broken but the pasty was amazing!!  Great local spot food is very well done"}
{"text":"YAAAAASSS. Just go. You'll see what I mean.   This place is eclectic and modern and the food is so good. I've been four times now and my first visit was just in September. It's now November and I don't live in Vegas. That kind of says something about it. Amongst all of the great eateries in Vegas that are casual or fancy, this is such a chill place. It's off strip and closer to downtown, but it's worth the trek. It really is.   The pasty has a rich history and it's basically like a pot pie with a full crust over a filling. My friend likes to describe it as an empanada, but it's baked.   I've tried so many things: bangers and mash was the best of all I tried, from Cajun chicken, curry chicken, spicy asiago chicken, Italian, salmon, thanksgiving and a few others I've forgotten. Always so full of filling, lots of flavor, juicy and with a perfect crust.   Just do it. That's all I can say. I love this place and really love that it originated in Arizona and made its way to Vegas! Yess!"}
{"text":"When walking in, this place is very dark but oddly friendly. The staff is helpful and outgoing. They have an outdoor patio that is dog friendly. The prices are not too expensive and the food is great."}
{"text":"Its all about the sticky toffee pudding...And I love the pasties, but I love their sticky toffee pudding better than Gordan Ramsey's."}
{"text":"When i first saw the name of this place, i thought \"pasty\" was pronounced with a long \"a\" sound. I was wrong! No nipple pasties here (at least none seen). I'm not a beer drinker, so i can't comment on that, but i am totally obsessed with the cottage pie (with beef)! It's the only pasty i order. I know i should try the other delicious-sounding things on the menu, but THIS is the BEST! You must order it! Then order the dessert with strawberries and kiwis, piled high with some type of meringue or whipped cream. I forgot the name. As soon as i sunk my teeth into it, my memory went away! You gotta check out this place!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, service, and drinks. Everyone was friendly, we could actually talk with the chefs as they made the food. Really nice pub type atmosphere, but with a focus on the awesomeness of the Pasties.  TRY THE SALMON."}
{"text":"What a unique spot! It's huge, with seating on both sides of the kitchen and a full bar in back. Some of the seating is family style with long rectangular tables and church pews. There are a couple of game tables (including pool) and rock music playing in the background.   I started with the jalapeño curry chilled bean dip, mushroom walnut spinach soup, and garlic jalapeño oven chips. All were good, but my favorite item I've tried so far is the Vegan Greek Pasty...DELICIOUS!! I came with 7 other friends during one of my visits, and every single one of them enjoyed their pasty. I tried some of the vegetarian cottage pie pasty, and I must admit that the non-vegan dough tastes even better than the vegan one. I read about the mushy peas in a couple reviews so I had to give that a try as well. I have no idea why they have received so much praise. We passed them around our table of 7 people, and not one person liked it. Maybe you have to be a huge pea fan to enjoy it? For dessert, we had the peanut butter and jelly pasty. It tastes just like it sounds, and was the perfect ending to our meal.  While I'm not a strict vegan, I'm probably close to 90% vegan so I originally came here because I heard that this place had vegan options. On their website, it says they have at least 4 vegan pasty choices daily, but when I visited the restaurant, their menu said they only have 2 vegan pasty choices daily. When I asked the server, he said they only had 1 vegan pasty available that day. This was the case for 2 out of my 3 visits. So my only complaint would be that I would love to see more vegan options here. Hopefully that will come with time.  I really do like this spot, so I will continue to be a loyal customer. It is a great place to take friends and they are open late (til 2am). The concept is very unique, and I have not seen any other location in Vegas that offers such a wide variety of pasties. I also do like the fact that their menu includes a bit of history about the pasty; otherwise, most people might just think they forgot the \"r\" in pastry lol."}
{"text":"I went to college at NMU in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where the pastie is King. These were as good if not better than Jean's Pasties which Are THE BEST in the UP by far. Music's loud, beer is good, and the pasties are beyond explanation."}
{"text":"Service tends to be slow just because they are busy every time I go during lunch but well worth the wait. Trippy restaurant with some trippy employees and amazing food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After viewing Yelp for many years I finally decided to start an account of my own and enter the wonderful world of review writing. What better restaurant to start with then my absolute fav, The Cornish Pasty. I live in San Diego and every time I come to Tempe it's always an absolute stop! Their menu is large and diverse and can please anyone! My favorite part is the vegetarian options that are amazing, even if you are not vegetarian. I have gone probably 5-10 times and every time try something new and love it. I have looked for places that sell Cornish Pasties in other locations over the U.S. although have not been successful. I wish I could wrap this place up, put it in my pocket, and take it with me on all my travels!   P.S- the PBJ dessert is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"An unusual find in Vegas.  I grew up on the UP of Michigan so am familiar with pasties. I never really cared for the traditional ground beef/pork,potato, rutabaga, and onion versions.  This place has them but also a huge selection of other options filled with stuff I like to eat.  I had the veggie Mexican and enjoyed it. They had some desserts that looked awesome but I had to pass.  Here is a tip- let it cool a bit before eating.  Anyone from the UP will understand when I say this place would have a lot of old Finns rolling in their graves but let em roll. I'd come back anytime."}
{"text":"I asked my daughter where she wanted to go and have dinner. She texted me back, \"Cornish Pasty\". I thought that she had dropped the \"r\" in Pasty. I, not being of supreme intelligence, thought it was \"Pastry\". So, I Googled, \"Cornish Pastry\". The search result returned \"Cornish Pasty\". Still, in my supreme intellect, I thought, oh they dropped the \"r\" in Pasty. I clicked on the link to their site and then I realized that I, again, had been fooled by my supreme intelligence and in fact, the correct spelling was \"Pasty\".  Now, on to the hard part. I still hadn't had my V8 moment because I didn't know that a \"Pasty\" was a culinary item. As I began to search the menu online, I thought to myself ( I would have thought to someone else, but no one was around) \"Hey, wait a second......Pasties are a dish!!!\". But, now having seen the fare (albeit electronically), I knew I would love this food.  As with previous reviews the place is narrow and small. But, what they lack in structure, they make up for in ambiance, knowledge and service. I ordered the Bangers & Mash and my daughter ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. All I can say is WOW. The pasties were excellent. And, for dessert we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding with creme anglaise. One of the best desserts I have ever had. I have truly expanded my culinary palette."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat downtown! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The food is really good, my favorite is the guiness stew pasty and their potato leak soup! Also their bread and butter is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food and a million options stuffed in these little buggers."}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty, doesn't matter which location, the food is always great. When I get take out for home, I stick with Oggies and Pilgrim pasties. But a couple of friends recently moved here and this is a regular meet up spot for us and we even celebrated our birthdays here on a Monday night.  Other great savory pasties I have enjoyed are the Guinness beef stew, Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie and breakfast all day.  Desserts here are huge and can be shared by 3-4 people. My favorites are the Banoffee Pie (not for those who hate whipped cream), sticky toffee pudding, and apple pasty. The PBJ pasty is also good but I don't usually go for that flavor for dessert, might make a good breakfast? Skip the chocolate bread pudding, its pretty dry.  Whatever you do, order the Transatlantique Lambic Kriek beer!! I don't drink beer at all, but I am in love with this one."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I go to this place at least once a month if not once a week. I grew up eating pasties, so I was really excited when this place opened. Bonus: the food is consistently delicious. My boyfriend loves their soup, so he'll order take out whenever his allergies are acting up. They have so many pasties to choose from, so we literally come here any time we have friends from out of town. We especially recommend it to our vegetarian and vegan friends. Whenever we have something to celebrate, we come here. So yeah, it's really great."}
{"text":"Very, VERY solid addition to Eastern Las Vegas.  It's blowing up on yelp, and I can see why.  First of all, if you haven't ever had a pasty, get over here.  They are large pocket sandwiches stuffed with all kinds of ingredients.  They are large and they are FILLING.    I had lunch at CPC on a Monday.  The place wasn't crowded at all, but a couple of tables came in after I sat down.  It has a nice combo of 2 top tables and large booths, plus about 16 seats at the bar.  I had the meat and cheese, which is pork/sage sausage with swiss and cheddar cheeses.  At $9.00, this is a great value considering the ingredients and size of the meal.  The crust was buttery and flaky and browned perfectly.  They clearly have the cooking of these things down.  The pasty was full, no bite was without meat and cheese.  The cheese was melty and the sausage was juicy.  It was a winner without sauces, but they offer you sauces!  I couldn't decide, so my server gave me both the cream mustard and the red wine gravy.  I liked both, but the mustard was the winner.  It was like a milder Dijon, and added so much to the sandwich.  I think the gravy needed to reduce a bit more to make it thicker and cook out a little more of the red wine flavor.  I got the side of garlic mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese.  I thought this was a normal sized side dish, and I was mistaken.  It was easily enough for 2, probably 3.  I liked the potatoes, they were as advertised:  garlic, potatoes, and cheese.  Simple and quality.    I got the wife the rosemary steak and oven fries to go.  Fortunately, when she ate, I got bites of both dishes.  The rosemary steak was again packed full of ingredients.  I may be mistaken, but I think it was even larger than the one I ate, which was huge.  The rosemary and potatoes make the pasty fantastic, it's basically a meal in and of itself.  The oven fries were long and crisp, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  This is another large side dish, easily shareable.  The dishes I took to go were hot and fresh when my wife ate, no loss of quality.  Overall, this is a cool joint.  Friendly service, and the food was great.  Good addition to Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice.  So I tried my first pasty today, and damn is was good.  I had the Shepard's Pie which was filled with meat, peas, carrots, and potatoes all covered in cheese and then stuffed in a flaky crust. They have many different kinds (about 25) so I guess I need to go back 24 more times or so.  They also have really a really good beer selection but I would rather drink all day at a place like Casey's Moore's and then stumble down here for the food.  Minus one star for not being around when I went to ASU and lived just down the street from this place, I could have biked home from the bars with a pasty in my hand."}
{"text":"The pastry is a place to get lost in. It's so dark and moody and the tables so long you can bring a big group and have a great time. Really cool bar that reminds me of and older style diner. Have to try one of the pastries. It's basically a hot pocket with really fresh ingredients to describe it for a philistine. Bring some friends and try this place out!"}
{"text":"I never reviewed this place?  Sheesh, what kind of Yelper am I?  When I heard Ween being played over the speaker, I knew that this place was something special--someone's got some character here.  The metal menus also caught my attention.  The Cornish Pasty Company specializes in Britain's answer to the calzone, and they do it in a delicious way.  You can get your dough stuffed a large variety of ways--from traditional shepherd's or cottage pie, to Italian and even Indian. Friendly service.   They have something for every taste, so stop by, order a tall one, and dig into one of their flaky creations.  No need for formality--just come as you are, relax, and get into the vibe of this unique spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food (I had the peppersteak pasty) - friendly knowledgeable staff! Our office orders from here regularly and picks it up and we have been in here a few times as well! I have also been to their other location and it is just as great! Great Job guys!"}
{"text":"Myself and friends had a great experience here. Very friendly and informative staff. We had a big party and they accommodated us very well. I encourage anyone having a special event or party to have it here. Environment and atmosphere are very nice. I give them a A+"}
{"text":"Most of their pasties that I have tried were very good. My favorite is the peppered steak. I would have given this place 4 stars, but my experience at this location was disappointing to say the least.   I called in for pick up at 12. Person said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got there around 12:25, which means my food should be ready to go.   Asked the waitress if this was where I picked up. She said it is, hold up. I wait on her. Then she give me my check and I sign for it. She then completely ignores the fact that I am even there, attending to everyone else, while I'm still clueless to where my order is.   I wait another ten minutes before I stop her and asked if my order was ready and she goes and check. I noticed upon arrival that there was a to go order in a black bag sitting there. The guy sitting next to the bag told me it's been sitting there for a while. She then tells me that order was mine. Had I not said anything, I would have still been there waiting not knowing when or where my order was.   What's the point of a to go order if it's as slow as if I was dining there?   Aside from that, the food isn't bad. And the gravy on top of the pasty just adds that much more flavor.   The atmosphere provides a great little hangout spot on the second floor. Pool, darts, bar, and tables accompanied by the church-like seating."}
{"text":"First off, I should mention that I'm not the biggest fan of savory items baked in a crust, ie empanadas, pot pies, etc.  But I couldn't ignore my fellow Yelpers checking into this less than a month old establishment over on the Eastside and the raving reviews.  Thanks to all the Yelpers who reviewed this before me, it definitely helped knowing exactly where they are located.  And where's that?  Commercial Center - Lotus of Siam and Green Door fame.  They are located next door to Komol, so keep driving and you'll find it there.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  But we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar/counter seating with large and small tables around.  Because it was Superbowl Sunday, the place was empty so we had our pick of where to sit.  The waitress was so happy to see us come in since previous Sundays bring in a good lunch crowd.  We started off with the Oven Chips with added Garlic \"Hand cut British style chips, cooked in the oven, with cracked pepper and sea salt.\" ($3.75)  It came out piping hot with ketchup on the side.    The Husband was immediately intrigued by the soups and went for the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton (Cup $3.50). It came with homemade bread and butter.  We liked the blue cheese flavoring in the soup and the dense bread that accompanied it.  The Husband chose a Signature and Traditional Pasty - The Oggie \"Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup.\" ($8.50)  He asked for a side of HP sauce too.  I got a little taste, but ultimately the Husband devoured all of it.  It's a pretty good size and for someone who drank most of the soup and finished the whole pasty, he was full!  I chose a Premium Pasty - the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) \"Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes.  With a side of mint-yogurt dressing or tahini.\" ($9.00)  I'm always skeptical about getting chicken breast because of how dry it can be.  This was not the case at all!  It was super moist, tons of flavor, and just really good.  I ate half knowing that I would be hurting if I even tried to finish the other half.  (I did eat the other half the next day and it was just as good! The toaster oven couldn't heat it fast enough for me!)  What I really liked about their pasty is the ratio of filling to crust.  There's a lot of delicious filling and the crust isn't excessive or dried out.  Ultimately, just really good.  I took a quick peek at their dessert menu and was bummed out that I was too full to order anything.  In retrospect, perhaps I would have split one pasty so I could order a dessert pasty too.  Nonetheless, we came back about four hours later and picked up a Strawberry Pavlova \"Homemade crisp meringue shells, filled with freshly whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi fruit and grapes.  Finished with raspberry coule.\" ($6.00) to go.  It wasn't the most exciting to look at when you take it to go, but it was nice.  Next time I'm going for the Apple Caramel Pasty, Shirley Temple's Pudding, or Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding since those seem a bit more unique.  They offer a pretty extensive beer menu that had the Husband wishing he could sit awhile and have a drink.  Happy Hour is all day on Sundays from 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 12 am on the other days, which means $1 off beer and wine.  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays also offer a special on the the certain alcoholic beverages.  Overall, we are liking the pasties that the Cornish Pasty Company are offering and are happy to see them in Vegas.  We only wish they weren't so far away on the other side of town from us!"}
{"text":"Omg. This place is great.  But terrible idea if you plan on drinking.  The food was sooo good, and too filling to the point where alcoholic beverages didn't sound good to me.  I had the mushroom soup, my friend had the tomato soup. Both were amazing.  Their homemade bread really makes the soup better when you dunk it in.  We shared a pasty.  It's like a fancy hot pocket.  Or different types of white people kind of burrito.  The crust of the pasty is so flakey and perfect.  And it's filled with meat and veggies and amazingness.  I love this place.  I have nothing bad to say.  The service was great too. As busy as it was, the guys were kind and attentive.  We sat at the bar, and I was surprised at our service cause of how busy it was.  Most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  They seriously need a bigger restaurant though.  It's so hard to get a group of people over 3 or  more in there."}
{"text":"Had a lamb vindaloo pasty, it was delicious! Like the way that food was prepared to order."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was very nice to ! We ordered the veggie chicken tikka pasty and the pesto pasty. Both tasted really good. Their deserts are delicious too."}
{"text":"I love this place as much as I love the English accent.  Cornish Pasty is moved beyond expectation by its consistent vision of, quality products, fresh food and employees that love the food so much one can taste it.   What else can a yelper ask from this location.  Its hard to find location but once you know its always a debat, Cheba Hut or Cornish Pasty, sometimes it depends what I did earlier in the day.     Its so hard to give 5 stars out but this place deserves it, I can't deny the whole experience and the restaurants dedication to food.   I also heard they have a great deal for Irish Car bombs."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner at Cornish Pasty tonight! I had the Bangers and Mash Pasty and Hubby had the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty. Had the hot baked beans on the side. Everything was delish. Amazing pastry. We really wanted to do the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert but were too stuffed.  Nice layout with plenty of both outdoor and indoor seating. We chose indoor since it was 105 outside. Very friendly service too.  We will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Heard about this place when it opened but didn't get a chance to try it until this past weekend and whoa was it delicious! So good that my boyfriend and I ended up returning the next night, bringing some new customers along with us.  Night 1:  I had read some reviews on here to kind of get an idea of which pasties to try -- I can't recall the last time I EVER went out and ordered one off a menu -- as well as some recommendations of their massive craft beer selections.   I start off with a beer, ordering the Banana Bread beer which was pretty tasty. The bartender then told us that was a popular beer and they only had a few left. Glad they still had a few available (I guess some other Yelpers had mentioned trying to order this beer, but the place had ran out)  A lot of people had recommended the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, so of course, I decided to take their advice. Boy am I glad that I did, because it was amazing! A little heat in there from the curry-esque flavors (i'm kind of a wuss with heat), but served with a side of tzatziki sauce to cool it down some. Perfect pair. (another reason this place deserves a high-five is because every pasty comes with a side dipping sauce and everything, in my opinion, is better dipped in some sauce)  My boyfriend order The Chicken Greek, was was also pretty yummy (I definitely liked my better though). We also ordered the Oven Chips with added garlic -- the garlic is cooked with the chips giving it a nice burnt flavor (burnt in a good way)  For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding which was next to orgasmic. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.  ---  Night 2:  We decided that eating here again the next night wouldn't be a problem, so we brought my parents along to share with their taste buds.  I ordered the Bangers & Mash Pasty, with a pork-sage sausage and the normal components that are included in B & M with an extra side of red-wine gravy to dip it in. My bf tried the Peppered Steak because he loves blue cheese and he said it was so good, better than The Chicken Greek, but a bit messy (or maybe he's a messy eater). My mom got the Chicken Tikka Masala, and my dad tried the Lamb Vindaloo. He said the Lamb VIndaloo was a little too spicy, even with the tzatziki, but it was still [super] delicious.  For dessert, we of course ordered the Chocolate Bread & Butter Pudding, as well as trying the Shirley Temple's Pudding (RIP Shirley) and the Banoffe Pie, all of which was equally yummy. The Banoffe was not a savory as the other 2, but still pretty good.  If I lived closer to Cornish Pasty, I would eat here maybe every other day. Good food, good beer, and the price isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Whoa. This place is huge and very well ventilated compared to their last location. Complete with pool tables, craft cocktails, and yummy food, this place is definitely something else. The only downfall is once they're out of a certain pasty, that's it for the day. I can only hope they have better and more consistent options for vegans!"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here, never been. My wife told me to glance at the menu before I went there since it was my first time. I didn't listen to her, I never do. It doesn't work well in my favor.....anyways, on to the Cornish Pasty.  I ordered the Cubano, house pulled Mojo pork, ham, swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. Served with mustard cream sauce, spicy mustard, or extra yellow mustard. This pasty was tasty. Large and in charge, I was able to take half of it home for leftovers.  Atmosphere is good, gets busy so get there early especially if you're meeting others.  They have other items like soup and salads which all looked pretty good but I had to have the Cubano. It was tasty."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been to this location.  They have really added additional space to the place which makes finding a seat much wasier. The downside is that the place is dark and somewhat dungeon like with horrible lighting.  The food was good, the beer selections were ok but could be easily improved by the additions of some more local and less pedestrian beers,  We will continue going to the Mesa location and avoiding this one. Same food but better atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical because English food isn't exactly considered a fine culinary experience. (For some reason I think of bleating sheep and porridge whenever i think of English food?) But I had the Oggie's (traditional) pasty and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The crust is flaky, but not like a croissant. It's tougher than that. The pasty came with a very nice gravy that tasted a bit like a mild A-1 sauce. The selection of European beers is quite wide.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, tons of vegetarian options, usually very good service. It is small, so be prepared to possibly wait for a seat or choose to sit at the bar for faster service. They also have great Irish car bombs here.   Don't pass up the dessert pasties either...the apple one is yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. The food is all reasonably priced, especially for the portions you receive. I've never had the beer here, but the iced teas are very good. I've also had the soups, pasties, and the apple pasty dessert and have been extremely satisfied with all of them. I try to get a different pasty each time and haven't gotten a bad one! Some tend to be a bit lighter like the eggplant, or you can get a heartier one like the shepherd's pie.   All of the server's are very nice and helpful. If it's a Friday or Saturday night i would make sure to get there early or send someone ahead of your group because it can get a little crowded."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and quaint! My husband and I stopped before an event and had a drink and shared a plate in the basement bar. Ariel was our bartender and was great but the most amazing part . . . I left my phone sitting on the bar and left for the show (I know, I'm a moron). We called 20 minutes later and Ariel had turned it in and the street level bartender offered to personally hold it himself until we returned to pick it up after the show. True to his word, he had it in his pocket when we got there 3 hours later.  We will definitely be back for the drinks, food and especially the service!!"}
{"text":"I'd leave 0 stars if I could. Service was terrible. Food was less than mediocre. Hot pockets at home are better. Again, service was horrible. Won't come back ever again."}
{"text":"Attended a Brits In Vegas here and loved the food. Beer list is heavy on American craft beers. Owner was quite pleasant. Excellent atmosphere and look forward to going back! Lost a star for the disinterested server who appeared not to care. Had to ask multiple times for water. Oh well, can't wait to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Ok I tried this place from recommendations from Yelp and they were all true. I had layovers for 3 nights in a row and ate here 3 times! It is so good I want to try everything on the menu! All the ingredients are so fresh and the meat is so tender and beautifully seasoned! But the Dough is to die for. Baked to a perfect golden brown crispy melt-in-your- mouth goodness. Today I was craving another pasty but was too far from Mill Ave to go back but discovered the other location on University and got a roast beef for lunch and 2half baked pasties to go so I can enjoy them at home. Don't miss this place. The two locations in Tempe look like great places for craft beer but can't attest to that as I was going to work and could not imbibe, but both locations have seating and have a very laid back feel. I am telling all who will listen to try this place. I will be in Vegas in two weeks and will seek out their location there!"}
{"text":"This place is mentioned regularly in some of the local hipster publications -- which makes sense, as it's located in the \"18b\" Arts District\" of Las Vegas.    Despite being anti-hipster, the food reviews & fact they had vegetarian items made me interested in trying the place.   I finally did so yesterday -- a Wednesday evening around 8PM.      My first & only issue was trying to find a parking space.   They don't seem to have their own parking lot, and there's no parking on busy Charleston Ave in front of the place.    Also, despite their efforts, the reality is that the Arts District -- full of interesting antique stores, some bars, and other artsy places -- isn't in the best of neighborhoods, so I put extra care into finding what I thought would be a relatively safe place to park my car.   I did find an \"OK\" spot about a 45 second walk away.    The Cornish Pasty wasn't very crowded, and it's apparently 'seat yourself,' so I ended up sitting at the counter, directly in front of where someone was assembling pasties & putting them on racks for baking.   The first menu I grabbed was for booze -- they've got a fair selection of beers, etc. and the prices seemed pretty good to me.   The next menu was the food menu, which was pretty extensive, and has a section specifically for vegetarians like me.  I did have to sit around for a couple minutes before a waitress acknowledged my presence, and by then, I was ready to order.    Being hungry (as usual) & assuming the food would be good, I ordered a Vegetarian Rosemary Chicken pasty to-go, a cup of (vegetarian) Cream of Leek soup, Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes, a Cheese & Onion pasty, and a Banana Bread beer (because it sounded intriguing).    I don't eat soup often, but the Cream of Leek soup was great!  It came with some bread & butter.   The beer was brought along with the soup.  While it did have a hint of banana bread flavor, I guess I need to lower my expectations when it comes to the level of flavoring.   I'm glad I tried it, but next time (& there WILL be a next time that I visit Cornish Hen), I'll try a different beer.  The order of Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes & my two pasties (one bagged to go) arrived about 10 minutes later -- a total of about 15 min after I ordered.  Both items were extremely hot, but I couldn't resist trying the pasty.   It was fantastic, as most cheese & onion combinations tend to be (for those that like cheese & onion...).  It came with some sort of sauce to pour atop it or dip bites of the pasty into.  Dunno what it was, but it added an interesting flavor & I used it about half the time.       The Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes were great too, though my brain & belly were both determined to keep stuffing my fat mouth with the pasty.  The potato dish was large enough to be an entree itself, and I ended up bringing the 2/3rd that I couldn't finish home.      It'd be cool if they could have a smaller portion of the potatoes, to be a side dish for the pasty.    My waitress asked if I was interested in dessert, but my belly was so full, I didn't even inquire what they had -- maybe next time.     Food was great, prices good, atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect for a place in the 18b Arts District -- somewhat loud music, though it was great -- a lot of 1980s 'new wave' type stuff -- Modern English, The Cure, Madness, Billy Idol.  Not the place to have a quiet, romantic dinner at, but a fun hangout/restaurant with great food & drinks, plus some pool tables, located in an area that is very interesting to explore (during daylight).   I checked, & there was no wifi offered by the establishment, but several open WiFi hotspots --*seemingly* offered by the Arts District-- available from within the Cornish Hen.    Keep in-mind as you read some older reviews that The Cornish Hen moved to their current location in Fall of 2016.    Some comments may not be applicable towards them now."}
{"text":"This place has at least 40 pasties to choose from, an extensive craft draft beer list, great service, a relaxed chill atmosphere and all reasonably priced. What a find! We wanted a night off the strip and the arts district delivered."}
{"text":"Incredible variety and it's all so delicious. I got the tikka masala pasty and a dessert and both were phenomenal. The atmosphere is also very cool, low light and casual but nice."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food. Happy I came in. Didn't know what a pasty was, but now I know and it's delicious! Had a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage...this makes me so happy. Cajun pasty, it's was good night."}
{"text":"First things first: Don't pronounce \"pasty\" to rhyme with those things strippers use to cover their nipples (um, or so I've heard...). It's pronounced \"pass-tee.\"   Pasties are a traditional lunch food for miners from Cornwall in the UK. They go back hundreds of years, and you can read the menu to learn all about that. Dean, the founder, head chef and all-around professor of pasties, will be happy to add even more, being the good Cornish lad he is.   Now, there are a bunch of things I like about CoPaCo. First, the pasties range from the traditional to the totally off-the-wall. The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough. The kitchen crew at this place proves humans built the pyramids - these guys work their tales off keeping the pasties coming, and they make Amish barn raisers look lazy.  Second, it's just a fun place. There's usually good, hard rock 'n' roll playing over the sound system. It's a place where you can have some ribald antics and loud laughter and nobody cares. It's laid-back and unpretentious. The staff is courteous, though they can get a bit harried during the busy hours. But they'll always try their hardest and be friendly.  Third, there are some great desserts. The bonofee pie (graham cracker crust, whipped cream, bananas, caramel!) is my favorite.  What could be better? Eh, I'd ditch the taps that disgorge Kronenburg 1664 and Hoegaarden and drop in a fewer higher-octane brews. In the meantime, the cooler is full of bottled selections. The Skull Splitter is awesome!  Keep in mind that even though I gave it five stars, this is not a fancy, high-falutin' sort of place. It's absolutely perfect for what it is: a fun place to gather with your hooligan sidekicks, eat creative twists on the Cornish pasty and listen to some rock music. Brilliant!"}
{"text":"I have had the Cornish Pasty Company bookmarked for well over a year here on Yelp and finally took a day off in the middle of the week and decided to give them a try for lunch. OMG! What took me so long. I ordered the Bangers and Mash with red wine gravy and my guest had the Royale with cheese. Both were absolutely delicious. These things are like pot pies in pockets. The crust is pheonomenal. The filling is tasty. I will definitely return. The pasties are a hearty size and enough to totally satisfy. We ordered the Banofee for dessert at the recommendation of fellow Yelper's. We each took a bite and had to pack it up to go. We had no room for it but it was ooey, gooey, whip cream, banana, caramel deliciousness. Our server was attentive and checked in with us often. I shall return in the very near future.  The pepper steak pasty has my name on it..."}
{"text":"New location, new menu items, but same wonderful taste! Cornish Pasty is now located in the Arts District right on Charleston. I did like the feel of the old location, but this is much better. Larger space, long bar and not so many dark corners for spiders to jump out and bite you while you dine.  On my visit back my hubby and I had the liver pate for the appetizer. Omg the flavor was amazing. I would have been perfectly happy with that and my glass of house white wine. But the meal got even better when our pasty came out. The downside to Cornish Pasty is they don't always have all their pasties, but the upside there are so many choices you will quickly forget what you originally wanted. On this visit we had the Meat & Cheese Pasty. When they brought out that lovely pocket of tasty goodness with sauce to dip it in. Wow! Heaven on a plate! I'll be going back again and again for sure!"}
{"text":"The eats here are excellent. When it gets really busy, the service can be a little slower than what's normal, but that's expected for any restaurant with food as good as Cornish Pasty Company.  My favorite thing to get is the Shepherd's Pie Pasty with extra wine sauce. I'd take that stuff home in a bucket if they let me."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very filling & delicious food (very vegan friendly), and a good variety of beer.  The menu is extensive, with two rows, front to back, of all kinds of different pasties. They have three or four varieties of vegan pasties: spinach & artichoke, Southwest, mushroom w/ balsamic vinegar, and Greek. I've tried them all and they're all good, but my favorite as of now is the Greek vegan pasty- SO flavorful, chock full of sundried tomatoes and different kinds of olives.  Sadly no vegan desserts. (I'd change this to 5 stars in a heart-beat if they fixed that!) If you're vegan, they recommend calling ahead of time to make sure they have the vegan dough for making the vegan pasties. They run out very often.  They're super friendly here. They want to make sure you're enjoying their cooking. The service is A+.   The atmosphere is great, too. Relaxed, quiet, and intimate.  Warning: hipsters completely fill the place up during dinner time. It's a real hipster cave."}
{"text":"I brought a group here for my birthday, the wait was worth it. I ordered the pilgrim and it was delicious. I love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Much like their fare, this place looks pretty unassuming on the outside but on the inside is filled with yummy goodness. I'll admit I was a little put off when I first walked up to the door of this place because it seemed just like a college bar or something and I expected something a little different. The friendliness of the wait staff and comfy and casual atmosphere of this place won me over pretty quickly though. After reading reviews here I decided to order the chicken tikka masala and that did not disappoint. My brother got their original with steak and potatoes and he loved that as well. Those little things are really filling. I came in ravenously hungry thinking I would have room in my stomach after finishing the whole thing, but after half I was already satiated."}
{"text":"This place is great.  had the Rueben and Tiki Masala chix. So good.  It filled you up.  Beer menu is large with options.  Staff fun and friendly.  We also had this huge cheese and meat plate. It was awesome.  recommend it."}
{"text":"I have now eaten at this place over a dozen times, and it's still five stars to me. Never ordered anything I didn't love. Amazing they can do that from their tiny little kitchen. I'm currently having an affair with their Greek pasty--in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian forms, it's amazing. Their tzatziki sauce is out of this world--and I don't usually like yogurt-based sauces. In fact, I can't think of a yogurt sauce I do like! Other tzatzikis fall flat in comparison. This one is great! We love the Italian, Cajun, Oggie, Greek, steak... oh, and do NOT forget the sticky toffee pudding for dessert! OM NOM NOM."}
{"text":"Iain was an amazing bartender who provided excellent customer service to me and my group. He's also super funny. I will come back to this location again! Also, he has the sweetest tits"}
{"text":"Liked this place better than I thought I would. \"D\" asked me out for late lunch so we met here around 2pm. It was hard for me to find, it's located BEHIND the AM/PM more on Hardy than University in my opinion. We walked in what felt like the BACK door and immediately were struck by the cramped style of the restaraunt. I wanted to run back out and go to the bar next door, but \"D\" really wanted a pasty. So I gave in. We walked to the front and sat at the long table with the long bench. That didn't feel as cramped as the two-seater tables.  we both had pomogranate ice tea, which was delicious after I added sugar to it. I ordered the Chicken Greek Salad Pasty and he ordered the Peppered Steak pasty.  When the food came out about 10 minutes later and I dug in, I finally knew what heaven on a plate tasted like. Both Pasty's were cut in half so he and i switched half of each others food. OH! MY! My chicken greek salad pasty was delicious, the artichokes and sun dried tomatoes were so scrumptious. I loved the dressing as well. It was all so good. The peppered steak was also delicious, although I'm personally not a fan of mushrooms and it had many in it. But besides that really great food. I loved it.   They were deceptively filling, so I want to go back and try just the dessert. Was too full to try it this time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ, and a great place to come with friends for great food and beer. The best pasty is the chicken pot pie, it's to die for! And the staff are all friendly and efficient. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are large, so we always have leftovers to take home. Cornish is the best!!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company always lands on my list when someone asks me where to get a good meal in Tempe."}
{"text":"I haven't had a pasty in a long time and I'm a bit lazy to make it (all that dough rolling)!   I got the Lamb Vindaloo and it was full flavored delicious. The lamb was tender and I was really digging the sauce. I had a side of mint yogurt and even without it, it was good. I most definitely would get this again as it's up my wheelhouse.  The BF got shepherds pie which had a solid filling and it was a nice take to have a crust on it for a different texture than traditional.   We also got the sticky toffee pudding (Shirley Temple Pudding on the menu). It came in a individual cast iron so it is hella hot! Don't burn yourself on it! I liked this because then the middle is soft, but you also get crispy edges if you eat from the middle out. It was a solid sticky toffee pudding.   It was a positive experience so the following week we came back with a friend.   I got the Peppered Steak this time and it was also a solid choice. I liked the stilton cheese in this one and it didn't really need the mustard sauce that came with it. The BF got the porky and our friend got the bangers and mash. Both were happy with their choices too.  I find our waitress super adorable and she's friendly and pretty attentive both times we've been in. We're checked on, we have drinks refilled and paying in a timely manner has been no issue.   Definitely a fan of this place. The crust is perfect crisp consistency and the pasty are filling. It's a good spot for various types of taste too as there is a filling for just about everyone. I'm not normally in this area, but the BF and I will make this a regular spot I think."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Oh yeah. My bf and I went here for dinner tonight. I was craving some Thai food but lotus of Siam wasn't even opened yet and already had a huge line :/ so we went here instead and boy was it yummy.  My bf had a peppered steak pasty which was pretty good but in my opinion a boys pasty lol I had a carne adovada pasty (my bad for spelling it wrong in the pictures) it was good but I wish I would have ordered a shepherds pie pasty instead omg they looked good. Next time for sure because we will definitely be coming back. The oven baked potatoes delish as well :))))   Definitely a must. Go go go!  Oh yeah and I think my bf would recommend the Scottish crabbie ginger beer (idk if I wrote that correctly)  It was too gingery for me but he absolutely loved it :)"}
{"text":"What a gem! It's so deceiving from the street, I had no idea that it had a lower level and upper level with billiards and darts. I was able to sample a few different pasties: the pilgrim, the Cuban, and Guinness stew. All so very good but my go-to would be the Cuban. The tap list is also good and features some local to AZ as well as from MI (yay!) It's one of a few places open late in downtown PHX and definitely my fave."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere with USUALLY excellent service!  However, our waiter today couldn't remember what was said from minute to minute, resulting in multiple bewildering errors such as:  -Blaming the bartender for not knowing which beer we ordered when we only ordered a single beer between the two of us, and that was through our waiter. -Offering the beer for free but in the wrong size and then ultimately putting it on the check anyway. -Leaving us at our table for 15- to 20- minute spans without service at least three times, once seriously appearing to snap out of a blissful haze and remembering that we exist just because eye contact was accidentally made. It was as if he seriously forgot that he was at work. -Blaming the computers being down for the fact that, even after kindly being reminded of our two-item order when we were finished eating, he could not commit it to memory for long enough to bring us a check with two items listed on it. Maybe you should carry a notepad? -As we stood up, cash in hand, to simultaneously pay and finally leave the place, we pointed out that he charged us for that beer. Naturally, he overreacted by crumpling up the check and saying our food was on the house. Okay... if you say so! -Lastly commented under his breath that he noticed we didn't tip. Wtf is 15% of zero? Especially when you did a total of 5 minutes of work in the hour and a half we were there, 30 minutes of which we were actually eating? You think the fantastic food we got to eat was worth less than your service? Absolutely not.  VERY UNPLEASANT. Jesus Christ. Your nonchalant, buddy-buddy attitude doesn't change the fact that you treated us like shit.  We tried to call the manager just to let him know that his waiter is insane, but the manager had his back and acted like we were being ridiculous for trying to give him a heads-up... Seriously, don't blame your computers being down for the fact that our waiter, your employee, was obviously stoned out of his mind.  So basically I want to rate this place five-stars for the food and the bartenders, but we will unfortunately be avoiding this place from now on."}
{"text":"Everything is so good here, my favorite is the salmon though, and the portions are surprisingly filling. They have a great beer selection too. If you want to try something new, try the scotch egg.  It's located in a plaza so lots of parking available."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and wanted to give it five stars but I couldn't! The atmosphere is very dark with a musty smell. I felt like it was very dirty but couldn't see, so I'm not sure if it was! I went during lunch time so maybe that's why the customer service was so bad?? I would have put all that to the side if the food was amazing but it wasn't. First off it's pre packaged... I asked for no onions and she couldn't do that, which was super sad!!! Only to find out that it was filled with 90% onions!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't know by driving by, but this place is . Great interior space, service was great, food was really good...portion sizes were spot on. You'll leave full. The bar area looked well stocked (didn't drink on this trip). Great place...will be back.  Oggie, side of garlic mashed potatoes, homemade lemonade, Rueben...all really good."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just wonderful.  Wide variety of fillings (sheppards pie, peppered steak and chicken & Brie) that were very tasty; something for everyone.  I also thought the sauces; brandy one and the creamy mustard were my favs.  Only real negative was how dark it was; jet black walls and ceilings, dim lights, but that wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"I went with four friends, we each got a different one and we each got to sample. Together we got the Italian, The Oggie, Meat and Cheese, and Mexican. They were all really good. I don't know how traditional they were, but I'm not an expert so who cares.   They were filled with filling, delicious, and worth the price paid. I would definitely go again, because there are many others I'd like to try. I can see how one would be hard to finish alone though, as they are pretty filling. One would easily make two meals for me, and I really love to eat.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off its pronounced Pasty like past. Not pastey. Ok had to get that off my chest because honestly that's how I was saying all along in my head. Had this place bookmarked for a while and decided since we were nearby to try.   Right off the bat when we walked in I didnt feel like I was in Las Vegas anymore. I literally felt like I had transported to England somewhere. The vibe is chill and laid back they have some booths and tables and seating also around the bar area which is where we sat. I liked the fact that the kitchen is an open area behind the bar and you can see them preparing food and cleaning and whatnot , nothing to hide. Very clean and well kept kitchen and bar area. We  came at night and the lighting is very dim , somewhere you could sit with friends and relax after a long day and  enjoy some good food and brews. Speaking of brews they have beers on tap here I've never seen anywhere in Vegas. Including Belgium beer and Irish beer.   We were greeted promptly upon entering. I was overwhelmed when I recieved my menu because I wasn't expecting so many choices. They literally had every cuisine on the menu. Mexican pastys , Greek , Italian , Indian you name it I'm sure they have it. Me and my boyfriend decided to order two and share them I'm a sucker for anything Thanksgiving so I decided on the pilgrim and our other choice was the Oggie. I wanted to order fries but they both had potato In them so decided not to. I'm glad I didn't because the Pastys were huge.   We shared the pilgrim and half of one of the Oggie. The Pilgrim was stuffed with sweet potato , onion , stuffing which I don't remember tasting and turkey. The Oggie which was my fav out of the 2 had steak , onion , rutabaga , and potato. Both came with red wine gravy and the pilgrim came with cranberry sauce of course. I liked the gravy but I felt like the Pilgrim should have had a turkey gravy not the red wine gravy. We split both pilgrim and half of one half of the Oggie and it was more than enough for 2 people. Probably because they put so much potato. Which is my only complaint. I feel like there should be some more meat. The pilgrim had enough turkey but more potato and crust to meat ratio on both.    So next time I will choose one that doesn't have potato with so many to choose from it was really hard. Next time I will be more prepared."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years!! Sooo good!! Cajun is a must... Hands down!! Super flavorful and the chipotle sauce it comes with is awesome. Warning:  if you try the Cajun, every other one you try (although still delicious) makes you wish you had gotten the Cajun."}
{"text":"I love this place. Why you ask? It has my very favorite beer of all time! Franziskaner Hefewiezan! The vibe is cool and is a great place to hang with our peeps on a friday night in the arts district. The food is legendary meaning cornish pasty dates back to the 13th century on cornwall england. The menu is expansive."}
{"text":"I'm a little late posting this but figured it was better late than never: the following happened a few months ago at the Tempe location.  Let me start off by saying I really, really like the food and they have a great selection of beer. The problem was with a waitress (she's blonde and thin) and how she treated me during our last and final visit to this restaurant. During our meal, I asked for a recommendation for a beer and gave her characteristics of beer I like as well as a recommendation for a pasty (I am really not picky but I cannot handle a lot of spice). I ordered both things she recommended and both turned out to be really not what I wanted at all. She recommended a beer that was really hoppy (when I had told her I like pilsners) and a spicy indian pasty that had a lot of curry (I'm sure it would be great for people who can handle spicy food--just a reminder that my issue with this restaurant is not with the food). During our meal she was really inattentive and it took around 30 minutes to get our check after we had asked for it. Because my boyfriend owed me money from earlier that day, I tipped lower (around 12%) and he tipped higher (around 30%) so our average tip on our meal was OVER 20%. We decided to leave a good tip because, despite the poor service, he really enjoyed his meal and we have had good experiences there before.   This is where things get really, really bad.   After leaving, I realized I left something on our table and approached our waitress and she gave it to me. After I thanked her, she said \"thanks for the (expletive) bad tip.\" I could not believe that she cursed at me for a tip that was over 20% and I was completely dumbfounded. I tried to find the manager but was unable to. It's a real shame that she ruined my experience with Cornish Pasty. All of my friends I was with as well as others have vowed to not go back there."}
{"text":"Delicious combinations of meat and other goodies wrapped in a beautiful crust. It's a hot pocket for people with taste buds. So many menu options and they all sound delicious. I went with the Philly Steak Pasty and it was awesome. Packed with flavor and cooked just right. Hopefully I will get over there again to try another one soon.   The chips were delicious as well.  They have a nice beer selection and the service is pretty good. The chairs at the bar I found a bit uncomfortable for someone of my size but still cool to sit at the bar and watch the guys prep some of the pasties.   Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Read about this place once in a magazine and added it to my list of restaurants to try.  Well, today was that day, lucky for me.  It is dark, narrow and noisy.  That is neither good nor bad, just my observation.  Staff is young and friendly, tho not what I would call professional.  Typical college attitude.  Again, neither good nor bad, just a fact.  Menu is amazing.  I love pasties and couldn't decide which to order.  There are also 4 soups and each one sounded better than the next.  The bread is homemade and to die for, served warm with a soft inside and crispy crust, as it should be.   There are 4 or 5 homemade potato dishes that I will attempt next time as well.  None of the frozen or instant variety here.  Can't wait to try the mushy peas.  Last time I had those were the real deal in London, but I am confident these will compare, if not exceed.  Service is fairly slow, but everything is being made as you order, so good quality, fresh food takes time.  Everything and I mean everything is made from scratch.  Very impressive considering the narrow, tight small kitchen, which is open by the way for all to see.  I have no idea how they work in there, but they do and they do it well.  Prices are great too. $6-$8 a pasty and should be enough for most appetites.   $2.95 a cup of soup with bread and butter.  I will definitely be back until I taste every pasty on the menu."}
{"text":"One morning I decided to surprise my wife for a nice english brunch before our eventual trip to London. Maybe I can find some nice brunch place around home. Lo and behold there was cornish pasty. Just open not too long ago and within stirking distance of my home and my belly. Boy oh boy did I packed the baby item and put the baby in the car fast.   Got there in a jiffy, park in the street around the corner and boom. Lamb vindaloo pasty and oggies pasty are up for the order. Absolutely authentic and great experience. Food comes a little slow, but hey they making it fresh for you. I dont mind waiting as long as the baby is calm and collected. Good service from our server and pretty cheap for brunch. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Dark historic building, laid back almost English Pub vibe. Great service and simplicity. Pick your Pasty, no substitutions. Have a beer. Try the tandoori wings. I always gravitate to the Lamb Vindaloo; but it's hard to find a bad one in the bunch."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with hubby after reading about this place in the Las Vegas Advisor.  What a great recommendation.  The area is not the greatest and we weren't sure what to expect entering the door, but inside you can sit at the bar or at tables/chairs lining the walls.  Service was good; menu has a vast variety of pasties.  We had the Bangers & Mash and the Cottage Pie.  Both were excellent.  Flaky pastry and ample fillings.  Definitely returning and recommending to others."}
{"text":"I'm really a fan of Cornish Pasty! This place is very affordable and the pasties are so yummy and filling! The Pilgrim is really good, but my favorite so far has been the peppered steak.   Our waitress was also really nice & the atmosphere is pretty interesting. They are also open late so it's a good place to get a nice bite and drink!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pastys with many varieties. Their other locations outside of California are just as delicious"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the service the waitress provided last night.  I'm out celebrating my friends birthday and the waitress had the nerve to have an attitude when I told her I didn't want the fries I had ordered because they never came.  She proceeds to tell me she didn't even put the order in because I was questioning the fries on how they were cooked.  She then proceeded to waive her hands in the air at me. Saying she ASSUMED I didn't want them?!.  Im so glad I kept my cool on that chick and she walked away.  I will NEVER step foot in that place again.  Not to mention the food sucked I ordered the wings and they tasted half raw.  This place was the joke of the night.  Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Few British pubs in the area and this place gets it right! Awesome beer selection and the prices can't be beat. Try the shepards pie pasty if you have never tried one- simply fantastic. It truly felt like we were back in Europe... Try something different and go to Cornish Pasty."}
{"text":"Tried the Roast dinner last night and it was so delicious I couldn't stop myself from eating it even after I was full! Also, I ordered their \"sage\" mixed beverage and that was great too!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty has been a go to place for my friends and I for several years. The food is always delicious, the servers are generally friendly, and there is a good atmosphere. The only  downside is that you usually have to speak very loudly because the music is always loud."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in all of the Valley! The good is wonderful. If you've never had a pasty think gourmet hot pockets. Any combo you can imagine and more on the menu. Are newly expanded location is great. more tables but no loss of the UK pub vibe."}
{"text":"\"Oi, this pint is cold!\"  I call to the barkeep.  \"Bloody well right.  We're not in London mate.  This is America\" and a laugh.     America, the land of \"Hot Pockets\".  Hot Pockets, pasties; toe-may-toe, toe-mah-toe.  Only difference, these are bloody good.  For the traditionalist, the Oggie; traditional Cornish pasty is hearty and comforting.  A \"stew\" of  beef, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga stuffed in a well seasoned, perfectly cooked through, semi rich pastry shell.  Despite the filling being moist, and the bottom being thin, it is still firm enough to pickup.  Impressive.  A side of mushy peas with it's baby food consistency and vegetal flavor provides the perfect accompaniment.  The crust lends itself well to non traditional pasties.  The chicken tikka masala hearty with a pronounced Indian curry taste, mild heat but somewhat dry chicken breast.  The Shepherd's pie with its flavorful, juicy, gamy lamb, creamy potatoes and root veg also good except for the odd addition of cheddar cheese,  Finally bangers and mash (sausage with onions and potatoes in a red wine gravy) good eats.  The slight acidity in the red wine gravy brings out the sage flavor of the British banger.   Beer works best with the pasties.  Very good selection including many British offerings.  Reasonable, off Strip pricing.  Great, off Strip service.  A single pasty is a meal and at less than $10 each, good value.  It's not perfect but at this price, who's complaining."}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorites. Very savory food, good drinks and a unique vibe. When I went in I felt the restaurant was versatile in that it could be casual or semi-fancy. I got the Oggie since it was my first time and it did not dissapoint. Nice flaky outside and hearty meat and potatoes on the inside. Looking forward to trying more of their entrees!"}
{"text":"Holy shit. I wish this place was closer to where I live.   I loved this place. Awesome vibe, excellent service and that Pasty...oh man. It was a massive party in my mouth! The bread was soooo perfect, and the fillings they do there were awesome.   We shared the -  Tikka Masala - pretty spicy with an excellent curry sauce. Nice big chunks of meat and potatoes... Pesto Chicken - very savory and full of flavor.  Seriously, the bread is amazing.   The rest of the group we were with got numerous other Pasties and non of them were disappointed. They all looked and smelled amazing! I cannot WAIT to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Coming to this place is always a treat. The food is amazing and they have vegan options that are delicious which I love. I almost always get the vegan vindaloo and it never disappoints! The service is always friendly, fast and over all great. I love the atmosphere and they have a walk up window if you're not feeling like going inside. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Baked goodies at Cornish Pasty done the right way!!!  These guys make divine pasties enough to satisfy anyone's palate.  It's like a hot pocket except it's made phenomenally better. They are freshly baked and piping hot out of the oven.  Lots of pasties to choose from Signature, Premium and Vegetarian.  My favorite pasty so far is the red curry chicken tikka masala. It was very delicious, had a kick to it, thank goodness for the ranch.  After that I ordered there Shirley Temple's Sticky Toffee Pudding with Vanilla ice cream. Seriously, the best pudding I've in Las Vegas.  Place is awesome, and I thought the staff was friendly.  I'll definitely be back to try some of their other pasties."}
{"text":"What the...? A Cornish pasty place in Tempe, AZ? I've had a hankering for a pasty for quite some time and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to the upper Midwest.   For starters, I like the menu here. Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties. There are about a dozen different kinds of pasties on the menu ranging from traditional (beef & potatoes or chicken pot pie) to unusual (salmon or Mexican), for example. The pasties are pre-made and warmed up to order and come with sauces. The red wine gravy I tried was very good. There are a few side dishes like chips, slaw, and beans, and some good looking desserts. (I can't say how they tasted; I had a second Strongbow for dessert.) They have several beers on draft and some bottles, too.   I thought the portion size was decent, but certainly not huge, and the prices fair, especially considering the next nearest pasty place is probably hundreds or thousands of miles away (aside from the CPC's other location, obviously). The pasty seemed authentic and pretty consistent with what I grew up with, but it was a bit salty and a bit dry, though the gravy helped. The flavors were good, though, and I enjoyed my Oggie (their main beef pasty).   The place is small, dark, and divey. There's a single row of tables mostly two-tops along one wall and about a dozen seats at the bar. Dark clothes, visible body piercings, and tattoos seem to be a prerequisite for employment at this place. I got the sense that this place turned into a heavy-metal bar in the evenings, though I could be wrong. I certainly enjoyed the Queen playing when I got there, and the two guys that waited on me at the bar were friendly, cool guys, and the service was efficient.   This is a place I'll visit whenever I'm in town. There's just nothing like it outside of England and the upper Midwest."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced. The beer selection is very nice. The oven chips take a long time to bake, worth the wait. The menu has a nice vegetarian section. The deserts are amazing. Good for lunch or a first date."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this location is so very on point. I love the upstairs seating, it really does feel like you're in a different world. The lighting is much improved from the Scottsdale location - I can actually see my fellow diners and the food that I'm eating. The pool tables and dart boards are definitely a plus.  Moving into the food...I had the vegan soup of the day, it was veggie noodle. Nothing special but the bread is always good. We also ordered the vegan vindaloo pasty with curried potatoes and \"chicken\" it was a big spicy for me, but I was able to enjoy a few bites. We ended the night with a really tasty apple pie pasty served with vanilla ice cream. It was really freaking good, went like the snap of a finger.   The service was chill, but attentive. You bet I'll be back at this location!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places. Doesn't matter which location you visit, the food is always crazy delicious. Great customer service....sometimes it gets a little slow during the busy times, but they always make up for it by acknowledging it and apologizing for it. They've even offered me a free glass of wine before. They always make sure you leave happy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.  The broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order.   The pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.  With so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Just thinking about Cornish Pasty makes my mouth water. I highly recommend the Royal with cheese. CP also has a great selection of local drafts. Good service, music and a kick-ass extension of the bar which overlooks the back of the kitchen. And the bread they make (from scratch) is a secret recipe (for good reason) so flaky and delicious!"}
{"text":"If I had infinite funds I would come here everyday. This place is amazing and I have yet to order something I did not love. The lemonade is some of the best I have had and the oven chips to share are a must every time."}
{"text":"Cajun chicken is good. They forgot to put our appetizer in which was whatever, but once we got our food it was awesome. By the time I finished my food, my pants went MOIST"}
{"text":"This place does have really good food, just expect to have lack luster service for the most part.   The last time I went here, my boyfriend and I were meeting up with his family for dinner. We entered the very dark and cramped restaurant and walked around looking to see if his family had already been seated. We stepped over into an open area to call them to see where they were when one of the cooks behind the bar barked at us \"WHAT?? CAN YOU NOT FIND A TABLE??\" like we were horrible human beings.   When we were seated, our waitress looked incredibly bored and plain disappointed to be serving us. The only person that seemed remotely interested in making sure we had what we needed was the guy that filled our water glasses and took our plates. He was awesome.   I know all the people that work there are cool and dress like they don't give a shit, but c'mon this is the service industry right? maybe they should try a little harder"}
{"text":"Wow!  I'll keep this short since there are over 100 great reviews on on Yelp for the Cornish Pasty:  1.  I didn't know what a pasty was until today.  It was truly amazing.  2.  Red wine gravy.  I've never tasted a red wine gravy like it.  Compelling.  3.  Excellent beer and cider selection.  4.  Small place, great environment."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall, filled up the hole in my stomach.   BTW pasties are HUGE, but never the less I managed to put one down with one of their delicious beer. The quint little place serves some of the best calzone style food. Would not recommend calling it calzone while you are there. You can pick through a list of ~25 different kinds of pasties, which just makes me go back and back.   The Pilgrim.What great combination of ingredients, it's like thanksgiving in a large covered shell."}
{"text":"Really delicious food with tons of variety. The location isn't the greatest but otherwise a fantastic restaurant and bar. Definite must try if youre in the mood for something different. ANNNND they have a variety of vegan options!"}
{"text":"The PastyCo represents the best of the Arts District.   It's a locals' spot,  yet it isn't.   Opened in December, this is authentic British /Cornish pub food.   And don't let folks fool you about British pub food.   Done right,  it is damned tasty!   Cornish Pasty does it right.   The space is big and accommodates all sorts of folks.   You can bring a group of 8 and find a community table.   Or you can head to the bar as a single dude (or girl) and find friendly service.  There are also lots of 2-tops dotting the walls.     They have booze.   They have cider.   They have wine.   They have plenty of draft beer choices.  There is something for everyone here.   As a guy who has made several trips to the UK,  this is the most authentic pub experience I have found in the states.   Try it - u won't be disappointed.   The Oggie and the Guinness stew are highly recommended.  But there are lots of vegetarian choices as well.   A shout-out to RJ who made my 2nd trip to Cornish Pasty Co the first of many.   He does \"orientation\" extremely well and gave me a history of the place.  But mostly,  he made me feel like a regular.   Thanks man!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, super chill, great food. Nice place to burn some time.  I always feel at peace here."}
{"text":"good food, different - never would of thought there was an english flavor in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, ok wine selection, REALLY GOOD FOOD. The pasties are essentially gourmet hot pockets- a variety of different boiling hot meat/cheese/veg/sauce combinations presented to you in a warm flaky pastry. There are so many combinations that you will DEFINITELY find something you like, whether you're a meat-and-potatoes person, an anything-with-extra-cheese person, or a vegetarian.  The place itself is pretty small. It has a very unique character. It's pretty dark, and the staff is a friendly gang of textbook alternative, slightly goth hipsters. It's a great place to go early in the night or if you're looking for a more low-key place to drink and munch."}
{"text":"The place was dark, very dark made for the ambiance, we liked everything except the bug crawling on my dates plate, where the waitress said oh here, grabbed it with napkin and sat plate back down. Needless to say we shared my plate. We now know why it's dark"}
{"text":"Dropped off at my no-tell motel at night I was directed to the offerings near me that, due to my delayed flight, were all closed. I went to Cornish Pasty as the Yelp app informed me that it was the only thing open and I had not eaten since 7am Central Standard time at this point and it was about 11pm in Vegas.  Imagine my delight when the nearest place that was open also happened to have really kickass vegetarian options. For most of my CES 2017 stay I would wander over here at night and grab something as my internal clock was off and I had little desire to keep standing and do any more industry parties.  Really good food, clean bar, people who were there let me sit at the bar, eat, drink, and read my book without saying \"nobody goes to a bar to read a book\" and me having to explain that I went to a bar to eat some food, not be in my hotel room, and play on my phone, not socialize.  So grumpy mctiredpants me approved."}
{"text":"The food and service here are great. I've been to Cornish Pasty company a few times now and have never been let down."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall surprise. It's in the commercial center off of Sahara, which is a very run down facility. Stepping into the Cornish pasty Company, you find a modern clean up well designed establishment. Very hipster-ish in its presentation. The beers and the Pastys were perfect. The portions were big and the place smelled wonderful."}
{"text":"So my friends from ASU had mentioned this Irish pub place that served what was called a \"Pasty\". From the sound of things, it was a hot pocket/pie sandwich type deal. They mentioned an array of options from pepperoni to peppered steak etc. All that being said, decided we should go there for dinner the night before I left Arizona. Especially after I saw 860 reviews with 4.5 stars up here on yelp. That's virtually unreal. Never had seen such ratings with as many reviews. Any who, drove up to what looked like a dead shopping strip with a bunch of stores/restaurants that looked closed due to the dark tint of the windows. When we opened the door though, it was actually pretty mind blowing. Walked around from what I guess was the front door to the bar side. Honestly, first thing I thought coming around that corner was that this place looked like something off the set of man vs food. Can't really explain it but if you're familiar with the show and happen to make a stop, you'll understand what I'm saying. So we sat at the bar and got our orders. I wanted something spicy so I looked out for something that I thought would match my liking on the menu. Found the Cajun chicken pasty which was spicy marinated chicken, ham, bacon, with chipotle sauce. My girlfriend ordered the bangers mash which was mashed potatoes, meatloaf and gravy. My Cajun chicken was amazing. Spiced to perfection as was hoping. My girlfriends bangers mash was ok. Not as much flavor as my Cajun chicken but still pretty good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It definitely lives up to the 860 reviews and 4.5 stars, a rare occurrence. Only mishap, which really isn't a mishap, is that if you decide you want to add any custom pieces together in your pasty, we were told you would have to make such request 24hrs in advance. These guys make the sandwiches hours in advance so that it's just put into the oven upon order. So if you're the type to want to customize your order, I suggest you call in advance but you likely won't make the a wrong decision with any of the available options."}
{"text":"We were hanging out at Hop Nuts & got the munchies. Placed the order over the phone & walked over. Ordered the veggie chikn pesto pasty & took one home to the husband for him to try. It was that good. After Hop Nuts we came here to hang. Fun restaurant & bar! Our waiter was very friendly & service was fast. Their Irish car bombs are only $4 and the perfect size! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"They did a real nice job on this classic comfort food. I had the Guinness, which was like beefstew in a pasty; just moist enough to be succulent but not so much that it destroyed the pastry. Which, by the way, was just about perfect: thick, cooked through with a deep brown finish; fried perfection. Wife went a little non-traditional with a Ruben pasty; just what it sounds like. Looked great. We also had a side of their fries, thick cut potatoes skin on smothered in cheese and very good bacon.   Down side, the service was erratic. They were clearly having a problem in the kitchen...shorthanded maybe. Our fries (billed as an appetizer) came out more than half-way through dinner. I think our waiter was the manager and he did his best to keep us informed on what was up...stuff happens. One bad night doesn't kill the experience for me.  Decor of the place was industrial with what looked like old church pews at broad wooden tables. The building is an old warehouse style masonry and open truss construction so it is loud; not much interior furnishing to control ambient noise but everyone around us was friendly. All in all; good food, nice staff, nice addition to the Arts District and I will go back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is amazing! Food is fantastic. What an awesome venue and great addition to downtown Phoenix. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time last night - the Mesa location is sooooo much better.  My boyfriend and I walked in and went to the patio. It wasn't overwhelmingly busy, and we sat down at a table. It took 20 minutes to even grab the attention of a server to order drinks. Our server came back with the wrong beers (really?) and then a different server greeted us (45 min. after sitting down) and we told her we were being helped by someone else. So the original server comes back with our beers and takes our food order - by the way, they do not have anything gluten free here, despite what other reviews say. The server said they don't ever have gluten free dough or anything. So that was a huge bummer, because my boyfriend literally couldn't get anything on the menu other than a salad. We finally got our food and it was fantastic (I got the chicken pot pie pasty).  Service was \"meh\" at best, food was great. 3 stars. I don't think we'll be going back to this location, though."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great food. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome, very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Service is slow and has gotten worse since expanding. Food variety is great and the boutique Pastys are very filling."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Honestly my favorite place to eat out at! Everything I've had from here(Vegetarian) has been so damn good! Great customer service! I needed help choosing a beer my first time here & my server was very helpful, let me try samples! I ended up finding the perfect beer! The prices are CRAZY affordable. The portions are HUGE! Every time I go I order something new & I'm NEVER disappointed!!! Love this place so much I even ordered it through Postmates one day because I was too lazy to go in person. If you haven't been here yet or are thinking of going, GO! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food, Boddingtons on tap, chill environment and friendly people; what else could you need in life?"}
{"text":"Honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely worth the trip from Mesa."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite restaurants but it was not as good as last time. My Pasty was a bit burnt at the bottom as well as my husbands. When we were first walked in it took a while for anyone to acknowledge us and then we were simply told to sit wherever we want. I hope next time I come its as magical as I remembered it being."}
{"text":"Delicious.  From the moment you get to parking lot the aroma is outstanding. Although I thought my Alfredo pasty was good, the pb and j pasty dessert was my highlight. It was a amazing. All the desserts sounded bomb. I can't wait to try them all. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Can't get any better than these \"gourmet hot pockets\". We're addicted and frequent this place often. All the locations have their own unique qualities and consistent menus."}
{"text":"This locale has a menu full of Cornish pasty choices. They are a pastry with savory fillings, sort of like a hand held pot pie-comfort food to the max!! They also have a nice beer selection featuring many local brews. Started off with fresh chips and added melted cheese. They were fresh cut fries and really worth the calories!!   We ordered the cheese and onion and the Greek chicken pasty. The crust was so delicious, amaze balls really! The cheese and onion pasty was filled with potato, turnip, onion and cheese. Very tasty and satisfying (a tad salty though). Washed it down with Koffee Kolsch ale from Huss brewing company (local to Tempe AZ). This was a spectacular golden beer with a coffee and vanilla finish.   This is a great casual place with a unique food offering that I haven't seen stateside in all my travels. Small indoor bar with about 5 tables plus additional outdoor bar and seating."}
{"text":"Great service, cold beer and an interesting product.  Had lunch and the food was great. The servings are large and you can share an appetizer plus a pasty with a friend."}
{"text":"The Tempe location got a nice bit of redoing and is now a lot bigger, but the southern half of the place is still hilariously and charmingly small. I love sitting so close to the cooks.  Tip: they half bake pasties for the next day late at night, so if you order one then it's noticeably different. The super fresh 11pm cajun pasty I got after (during?) my bachelor party may be the most delicious thing I've eaten. The bar's got wonderfully cheap car bombs, and they leave a nice note on the receipt when you get one."}
{"text":"The BEAST! Embrace it.   The Beast is what you call the divey bar off to the right with pool tables and a killer jukebox. Full bar, full menu. Open late.  If you don't know, now you know."}
{"text":"ive been here twice.. the first time was decent. my friend and i shared a couple pasties. nothing too exciting...   the second time was better.  i shared the pilgrim and the chicken and pesto.  the pilgrim was pretty good.. its just like thanksgiving--turkey, gravy, stuffing, cranberry sauce.   its worth a try!  they enlarged the place and have a ton more seating, so that was helpful!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few cherished instances in which you should believe the hype.   If you've ever craved a Hot Pocket in the slightest, you will be in a crust-induced heaven here, and they are diet-restriction friendly with a long list of vegan/vegetarian options in addition to an already generous, creative list of possible pocket stuffings. For example: Roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing. Thank you.  I opted for the Eggplant Parmesan, and I enjoyed every last bite (even though my last bite was taken the following day because these things are huge and leave you with more than enough to take home).   They also offer the traditional pasty (The Oggie with Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga) part baked for $6 to take home and finish cooking, a very thoughtful, smart offering.   The environment is 10-times nicer than I anticipated it would be. I had assumed it would be a counter-order place, but it is actually a sit-down restaurant with a warm, cozy atmosphere and a big wooden bar for throwing back libations.  I will say our service was slow, but apologetic, and given the long list of beers, we had plenty to keep us entertained. If you're looking for comfort food and beer, go chow like a Yooper."}
{"text":"my bartender did not blink once, incredible, thank you ian!  great servers, bartenders, food, and draft selection. love this place."}
{"text":"This place looks like a tiny dive bar in a ghetto strip mall. I was very nervous when we decided to give it a try but it had excellent Yelp reviews. It's hard to find good British food in Vegas, unless you go to an overpriced celebrity chef restaurant on the strip. No thanks. However, the food was excellent! The food was delicious and reasonably priced. Our server had a great sense of humor and actually seemed to enjoy her job....that's harder to find than you think. I went back a few weeks later with a different group and had the same great results. I would eat there weekly if they would open another location on the west side of town. For now I'll have to settle on trekking across town every other month or so, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty because it reminds me of my Aussie friends...not English, I know, but bear with me.  One of the best things to get when you are hungover is an Australian meat pie or sausage roll...same concept.  My favorite has the be the Oggie because it's exactly like other ones I've had.  Love it and a must do!  Plus they serve bottles of Chimay...LOVE Chimay.  AND they have Pavlova, another Aussie favorite.  Hmmm, the Aussies are just British criminals, aren't they....it's close enough.   You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Always a good time. Excellent soup, especially the tomato basil. Comes with fresh homemade bread!   Great food, drinks, music. I'd recommend this little hole-in-the-wall to ANYONE :)"}
{"text":"I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone.  Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret.  I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it."}
{"text":"I have been trying to come to The Cornish Pasty Co for a very long time now and I was not disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious. Being from England myself I can honestly say these are the best pasties I have ever eaten. We ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty and also the Cajun Chicken pasty. Nothing short of amazing. The Bangers and Mash took me back home after the first bite, perfect sausages with great mashed potatoes with grilled onions, yummy. The Cajun Chicken was a great twist that I have never seen in a pasty. Delicious chicken with ham, bacon, and swiss cheese, oh and lets not forget the chipotle sauce to dip in. Also ordered the oven chips with cheese and jalepenos. Everything was piping hot and fresh, made right in front of you if you're at the bar. Place is nice on the inside with dim lighting, staff was great and friendly, their looks and personalities bring the place alive. Large selection of beers and wine from all over the world, no hard alcohol here. Only negatives is the no hard alcohol as I'm a Jack and coke kind of guy and the location is a little hard to find as it's in a large complex. Don't let the black exterior stop you from entering, it will be your loss. I will be returning very shortly!!!"}
{"text":"Fun/hipster vibe with 3 levels - lower lounge, first level bar tops, second floor billiards and bar top tables. Great group of friendly staff. Wide variety (that's an understatement) of pasties. Delicious Greek salad with excellent green garlicky dressing. The Guiness pasty has much cheesy goodness and some hearty flavor and good presence of rosemary. You can see the staff making fresh pasties front-of-house as you sip a brew on the first floor. Their desserts are all house made and the dark chocolate brandy bread and butter bread pudding is excellent (with the creme anglaise of course!). The banofee pie is great as well. Looking forward to trying the Tikka Masala salad or pasty."}
{"text":"1. They offer Rogue on draft. 2. They have umpteen billion different pasties. 3. It's not in North Phoenix or Glendale (read my reviews of places in those locations) so you are almost guaranteed to not dine next to redneck, lifted truck, white trash. 4. Service is really friendly. 5. Great soundtrack.  I wholeheartedly recommend it. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already so I'll leave it to that."}
{"text":"The place is unique and in a weird location for Vegas. The menu for pasty's is extensive so it's hard to choose.  The food is good relatively inexpensive and made fresh and hot. The fresh fries with cracked pepper and salt were great just go easy on the jalapeño. Will have to come back and try the other selections."}
{"text":"Always good. Great environment. Great beer options. And the food is awesome as it always has been since I would go to the one in tempe"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked up on this place while walking on Mill Avenue before a movie...OH MY! DE-LICIOUS! We had the 2 types of wings--- the sauces were SPOT ON! The tandoori wings and another kind - WOW!  Then the pasty; the thanksgiving one -THE BOMB AND the rosemary chicken - POW! The seating was limited and tiny but we sat at the bar. There's PLENTY of setting outside but it was a little chilly. The dishes coming out of this TINY kitchen in the back is crazy good!!"}
{"text":"Great food and piping hot . The pastry is outstanding . I had he Royal and it was better than any burger I've ever had"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere here! Definitely a lively feel and the open kitchen gives you a chance to watch the chefs hard at work hand-making each pastry. Good draft list too!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food. But don't come in a hurry. It should not take a group of 8 2 hours to eat. Dealt with a server and a bartender...both gave the same excuse on the excessive wait for anything 'Sorry, we are slammed. Been running around.' No...there are 3 tables here. You were rolling silverware and you were chit chatting with someone. Saw neither one ever actually running around anywhere. Will be back cause the food was THAT good. Just expect a long wait and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Last night, my fella decided that we should go somewhere new for dinner.   I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and picked Cornish Pasty Co.    I love the layout.  The bar is cozy, with tables along the walls, and a decent amount of seating at the bar.   Our server was very polite, offering recommendations, and confirming that we had made good choices.   The food: The Leek, potato and Stilton soup:  YUM.  I really enjoyed this...in fact, even if I didn't enjoy the rest of the meal, I'd STILL come back just for the soup.  It was full of flavor, and served with a slice of thick bread that was delicious and dense, but not heavy (if that makes any sense whatsoever.)   We decided on the Lamb Vindaloo pasty, and the Spicy asiago chicken pasty for dinner.   Now...I know that lamb vindaloo is Indian.  I know that Indian food is spicy.   I wasn't prepared for how insanely hot this was.  My fella LOVES spicy food, and it was almost too much for him to handle, even with the tahini.   My lack of spice-endurance aside (I only had about 3 bites before I almost died), the lamb was REALLY tender, and the vindaloo was delicious.  I wish I could handle spice better.    The Spicy asiago chicken:  WHY on earth would I order two spicy dishes?  I'm a masochist, I guess.  But this one was much less spicy:  chicken and a ton of melty asiago cheese with black beans, corn, and hatch chilies, served with sour cream and salsa. I LOVED this.  I actually ate so much I was uncomfortable after, which I haven't been doing lately...but I couldn't help it, it was THAT good.  The beer that my fella ordered was a little weird...I sadly don't remember the name of it, but it was kind of a stout, and the small taste she gave us was awesome.  We ordered the $7 glass (which is ENORMOUS, by the way) and it was awful.  Super bitter, with a weird color and texture....not pleasant.  We didn't even drink half of it.  I think next time we'll stick with Guinness.    The only real issue I had with the place was that sometimes the music seemed to be a little too loud, but it wasn't awful..especially when the music switched over to Bauhaus and Joy Division.  :D  Also, kudos for stocking PG Tips tea!!!    I enjoyed Cornish Pasty a lot, and look forward to going back and trying other pastys...the shepherd's pie is on my list!"}
{"text":"During my last Vegas trip I finally got to experience this place--worth all the hype from my friends! First of all, it's way off the beaten path, which is great. Second of all, lots of reasonably-priced tasty homemade pies, with a good selection of veg-friendly choices! Third of all, a great beer selection. I got their Veggie Mexican (Mexican-spiced Quorn© brand vegetarian ground beef, egg, potato, jalapenos, and cheddar. With sides of sour cream and salsa) but I had to get it to go and didn't get around to eating it until breakfast the next day. My hotel room had an oven so I was able to heat it up properly and it was still absolutely delicious! Very generous portions and really well-made. I'm a fan! Speaking of fans, the only downside for me was their lack of good AC--we were all wilting in the place while the ceiling fans and ineffective AC struggled to battle the heat. If you can't handle the heat, get your pie(s) to go; they're worth it.  STEPH JUDGEMENT: Great homemade pasties and a solid craft beer selection make this place a winner."}
{"text":"Great food, at a decent price, the reason I am giving a low two star rating is because of lousy service, and horrible new location. First off let me say the pasties are good and I had a salmon Cesar salad that was great. But the service was bad, when the three of us first walked in I stepped over to one side to see if there was an actual tables available,  instead of at their church pew, bench tables, and the waiter who's name appeared to be Sonn De Mon, in a quite rude tone told me to wait a minute and he would  Seat us. When I asked for an actual table with chairs he again rudely informed me there weren't any and we would have to set here, and he lead us to a bench table. It took quite some time to get our order placed, and when he brought the soups, he brought one that was wrong, I told him it was wrong and he claimed that's what was ordered, he came back a minute later , and said he made a mistake and switched the soup out for the correct one. Later he poured ice tea in one of my friends water glass. When it was time for us to go we asked for three to go containers, he brought us two. The service and the location is what brought this down to a two star in my opinion, the new location has no parking, there is only street parking and a parking lot about a half a block away."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this downtown location, because we love the Tempe spot, but we were left very disappointed and physically ill. We waited 10 min for water, then a new waitress appeared to take care of us. She let us know that this wasn't her area and she's only here helping out due to being short staffed. No big deal. We waited another 10 min for water and 10 for the two drinks we ordered. They seemed to be out of a lot- lemonade, beers, vegan Pasties. Again, not a big deal. We waited 30 min for our food and when we got it they didn't give us silverware. We waited 10 min with hot food in front of us for the waitress to come back with only 2 sets (there were 5 of us). We dug in anyway, and it wasn't until we were 3/4 of the way done that we got the other 3 sets of silverware. On top of it all, 3 of us came down with severe food poisoning. We didn't eat anywhere else, so it had to have been from here."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the commercial center outlets is this unsuspecting Gem. Nothing snooty on the outside. On the inside palate heaven awaits. Took 3 of my co-workers there today, impressed with the menu selection and variety of pasty flavor combinations including multiple vegetarian selections. But I'm a meat kind of man. I had the Carne Adovada pasty, filled with delicious Mexican spiced pork paired with salsa and sour cream and a Wookey Jack dark rye IPA. Crust was baked to perfection, flaky and delicious. Beer was prompt and wonderful. Friends had Bangers and Mash (with house made sausage) and the Pesto Chicken (house made pesto), we inhaled everything. Great fast service and turnaround and you can watch the creation of multiple pastys near the bar area by the friendly rag-tag crew. Good selection of draft microbrews and canned beer to satisfy your thirst. Looking forward to their new digs and cocktail menu when they make the move downtown in the future. Regardless this remains a great place with takeout or dine-in for a great meal."}
{"text":"Incredible food.  Amazing service.  The server was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable.  Every pasty was delicious, and they always have a few fully vegan options.  Also tried salmon with the salad and it was cooked perfectly. Don't expect a super quick meal, but settle in with a draft and let the food win you over."}
{"text":"Best food in Tempe. The cuisine appeals to many different types of people, from young to old. Probably not a place to take super young children, but teenagers will love it. It has a dark in divey feel. The customer service is awesome; from the guy that finds you your table, to the waitstaff, bartenders and the cooks. This is a must see restaurant in Tempe!"}
{"text":"If you can find it you will enjoy it - It's a tiny place located around the FAR left side of the plaza on the NE corner of Hardy and University in Tempe.  The Pasty, I was informed, is a long ago English mining tradition. Which breaks down to it basically being a \"Limey's\" take on a burrito. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limey  We tried this for lunch on Sunday - Her cheese steak pasty was amazing, and my chicken pot pie pasty was delicious too. The crust is so so flaky, and the \"oven chips\" with jalapeños were the best I've had. This is NOT fast food, so don't be in a rush when you visit."}
{"text":"OMG so good! Plus, the cooks control the jukebox and they have incredible taste in music.   Minus 1 star for being out of three different beers.  Plus 1 star for having awesome bar/waitstaff. Dylan was great, kind, and patient.   This is definitely a worthwhile place to eat, though from the outside, many will pass it right on by. But if you like local haunts, and want to stay off the strip, but don't want to cab it downtown, get a Pasty ...or three!!!"}
{"text":"All the positive reviews speak for themselves.  This is a great place to get your eat on and have a couple pints.  There is a pasty for everyone, really.  If you can't find one that suits you, then you need to become anorexic, let your hair fall out and start eating through a feeding tube. Sorry to all the anorexics out there, but seriously, the selection at this place might cure your illness, all I'm saying is you could try."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I have been here many times over the years and I don't think I have ever had a pasty that wasn't delicious. I honestly believe that you could open the menu, blindly point to any one of their pasties, and you will have a delicious and satisfying meal.   Oh, and don't forget, both their bottle and draft beer selections are any craft beer fans dream."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great atmosphere and fantastic food. Must try the chocolate bread pudding!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly. They answered all of my silly questions.  The beer selection was great and I was able to sample things. I even met one of the owners and watched him make pasties with fresh ingredients.    Speaking of food. OMG! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way! I finally got around to trying this place and, damn, I'm sorry I waited so long. It's really fantastic food! Yeah, it's in a sketchy, post-apocalyptic-looking shopping center and all, but the food is absolutely phenomenal! I almost regret even posting this review because I kind of want to keep this place as much of a secret as possible. I could go on and on, but I'll spare you. In a nutshell: They offer a wide variety of pasties. So many, in fact, I can't see ever choosing one without being a little bummed you didn't go another way. They are hot, filling, freshly-made comfort food at it's best. That's really the best I can do here. I lack the vocabulary to do them the justice they deserve. You just need to try one for yourself. You will not be disappointed. If you are, you are probably a real jerk. The dining room is small and cozy and (yikes!) dark. All of which, I dig. The seating sucks, though. It's either big, communal tables or some of the most form-fitting chairs I've ever let get to 3rd base. They had a delicious dark beer (can't remember the name), but I couldn't handle sitting on those seats long enough to drink more than 2. (Yep. The seats suck that bad and I'm still giving them a 5 for their food) Beyond that, the staff is friendly and attentive and the like and the prices are very reasonable. You can actually do it \"take and bake\", for a discounted price, if you prefer. We did a caramel apple pasty that way and it was awesome. So, yeah, this place is a fantastic find and, no matter how badly I may want to keep it a secret, I can not recommend it highly enough. I think this calls for a \"BOOYAH\"!"}
{"text":"This is a spot that has yet to have a con in my book. a huge variety of pastys that have all been delicious. great filling with a perfectly flaky crust. and they always have just the right sauce to really compliment the dish. everytime i go i always get the garlic mash potatoes. cant beat $4.50 for that size portion. its a meal in itself. and im a sucker for a scotch egg. Their beer selection was fine for me but my beer snob bf wasn't that impressed. he never is."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is just excellent! Very small place, feels like it should be in new york city or something...  Every pasty i've eaten here (probably 5 varieties) have been EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Great food service was slow but it was a busy night, the royal with cheese is amazing"}
{"text":"A friend of ours recommended this place for us a year ago and this has been a family favorite. They recently moved their location but still the service and food are amazing. The pasties are always fresh and filled with the right amount inside. They have variety of pasties to choose from but my ultimate favorite that I would recommend to anyone is the Mexican. Please keep doing what you guys are doing because after every visit you guys kill it! I recommend this to everyone I know! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and myself decided to make this our last lunch before Christmas stop.  And while I have been here a couple of times before . . . I noticed that I had never written a review.  I had The Royale with Cheese a side of their British Style Baked Beans, and a Boddington . . . the pasty as always was out of this world, hot, juicy, cheesy, and full of flavor . . . the beans were a disappointment, dry, lacking in flavor, however, very spicy . . . the beer was a little on the warm side and had to let it rest before I would drink it.  Ultimately, you come for the pasties, and as always they were great . . . with a little work on the other two items . . . five stars is easily attainable . . . and yes . . . this place is as always is definitely on the I WILL BE BACK list."}
{"text":"Never thought I would be walking into a place with the word \"pasty\" as part of the name! Because one of the times I've been, we discussed/showed a nonnative English speaker the differences between pah-sty and pay-sty. Quite the conversation that evening, and I will never think of them again the same way.  I never knew that this place was a Must-Do until looking it up afterwards! The only thing the guys in my volleyball group said we were \"going to a place nearby [to Mitchell Park] for beer and food\". I love beer. And I love food after a few hours of sand volleyball. Score points for them getting me to Cornish Pasty Co!  We walk in and I'm definitely taken back to some hipster dives and British pubs I've been to in my time. While it was a little too dark for my liking, I get the hipster feel they're going for since that's the majority of people I've seen there. The service has been wonderful - cheerful gals who consistently ask if they can help in any way and know their stuff.   The beer list is small, and I like it! Within two weeks of my two visits, the beer menu had changed. There were a few breweries that hadn't changed, but the styles had. ALL THAT is what I call quality. Even better, the two servers were knowledgeable about the entire beer menu each time. They must do extreme taste-testing before the beer menu goes out [which I'd be totally jealous of!]. The food is even better - my fellow volleyballers love the soups, and we all agree on the pasty's. I love love the Bangers & Mash Pasty, and the Oggie looks delicious too. You just can't go wrong with them... unless they are sold out for the day. My next goal is to try their desserts which sound very appealing!"}
{"text":"Great Pasties. My favorite is the Reuben, you get a lot of meat and the texture of the pasty is awesome. Lots of food as well!"}
{"text":"Great food with great selections of tap beer here.  The only thing that bothered me a lot is that our waiter is really inpatient. This wait staff with blue hat has no smile at all during the whole two-hour dinner service, and makes all three of us feel that he's trying his very best to kick us out as soon as possible. Not showing any customer service at all."}
{"text":"I had the cajun last week with a giant 34oz cider..  The food was awesome.  Pasties are typically pre-made, although by pre, I think they mean within the last 20-30 minutes..  Mine was fresh out of the oven.  So delicious.  Never eaten anything like it.  The service was great, everyone was very friendly.  I sat at the bar, so I got to watch the chef's preparing the next batch.  Be sure to tip those guys too.   I'll be back soon, with company.  I have a few more pasties to try.."}
{"text":"For me, this is an acquired taste. The pasty that I got had a strange and pungent smell to it even though it was delicious. We sat at the bar when we came here and had a chance to observe the surrounding a bit. The bar area makes you feel like you're being taken back to the good old \"Irish\" country pub.  I don't know if I will come back because my pallet isn't Irish enough. However if you like pasties, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Second visit, just as good as the first:  Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup with Homemade Bread and Butter  Cheese Steak - Onions, Green Pepper, Mushroom, Swiss, Red Wine Gravy  Chicken Pot Pie - Carrots, Red Potato, Green Beans, Celery, Thyme and Chicken Gravy  The Pilgrim - Turkey, Sweet Potatoes, Grilled Onion, Stuffing, Cranberry Sauce  Banoffee Pie - Graham Cracker Crust, Caramel, Whipped Cream, Bananas  Apple Caramel Pasty - Apples, Cinnamon, Caramel topped with Ice Cream and Whipped Cream  Moving from sweet to savory (and then back to sweet) our arrival at Cornish Pasty Company was met with a raucous crowd enjoying any number of craft brews but seated swiftly as Led Zeppelin, The Who, and The Ramones competed for air time overhead we were greeted equally quickly by an excellent (and funny without being fakey) young server who understood our time constraints in terms of making it to the game and took our whole order at once noting that she'd place the order in a staggered manner to make sure food wouldn't pile up while still leaving us time to make it to ASU by kickoff - a plan that worked flawlessly.  Knowing from my last visit that the pasties would all be excellent - and they were - what truly wowed during this visit to Cornish Pasty Co was actually the soup, a recommendation from our server as \"her favorite thing on the menu\" - a dense, creamless potage with a hefty mushroom nose and a subtle vegetal note on the tongue while the walnut base added a lingering smoothness that went well with the hearty housemade soda bread and cultured butter.  Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is a cool place with good food.  It is in an old run down building that looks pretty bad from the outside, but has a lot of character and is interesting once inside. Don't let the appearance stop you from eating here though, the food is quite good.  If you don't know, a pasty is a bit like a cross between a pot-pie and calzone.  They have amazing combinations of meats, veggies, and spices so that everyone will enjoy something (if like pot-pie type foods in the first place).  One time, we called ahead and ordered food while driving to the restaurant.  When we got there, we were seated and food was on the table in under 2 minutes.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"My friend was really itching to try this place and even though it's not \"gluten friendly\" per se, they did offer a couple of salad items that would work for me. When we got there it was really dark inside, almost like a throw back 70s lounge feel, especially with the music they played. We were told to sit anywhere. Our server was Sarah who was absolutely wonderful. She was really on the ball, a great server, and anticipated our needs in advance. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, my friend got the Porky pasty. Our food came in a rather timely fashion despite it being a very busy Friday dinner rush. I enjoyed the salad, the portion was huge. The chicken was tasty and there was plenty of tomatoes, cukes and dressing (on the side). My friend really enjoyed the Porky and even took some home, as it was quite a lot. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place when we first walked in. The darkness really didn't convey fun and friendly but the service was great and so was the food so it more than made up for the initial shock I felt upon arriving. Sarah, keep being awesome, all servers could take a lesson from this gal."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while we were our out sightseeing. It's located on the corner of a not so great looking part in downtown. We decided to stop in because we were starving. Outside the place doesn't look like much, but inside was out of this world! They had tables and booths that looked like old church pews. The decoration is very mid century British and you can watch the cooks make your dishes right in front of you. The staff was so inviting and friendly. The menu has dishes that are very British and some more Americanized.   We ordered the Royal with Cheese and Pork patsy. My mom had tomato soup and a pasta salad. The food came out fairly quickly and was so tasty! My mom raved about her soup and salad. Our patsy were so unique and filling! They are VERY heavy since they had a meat and potato base, so just a half of it filled me up.   The surprise was in the back when I went to the bathroom. They have a large bar area in the back with pool tables and a dance floor. Next time we'll come back later at night and check it out and grab a drink.  If you're looking for unique tasty food with great staff you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with pasties while in england.  CPC is a little yuppified -- real pasties are served from street vendors or behind a counter to travelers about to get on a train or walk down the street.  I had a chicken-pot-pie pasty and it was delicious.  I don't think I'll eat in again, but only order to go because the PLACE WAS LOUD!  Heavy metal music played loud enough that people had to shout.  The din was harsh and loud enough that I was itching just to get the hell out and away from the noise.  Forget desert.  Just get the hell out."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie I've seen this place under hot on yelp a ton and I always read it as \"Cornish Pastry Co.\" and not being someone who really goes to places for desert I never even read reviews. Yeah, whoops on that one.   Almost everything I have had here has been great. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great find. Tucked away in Commercial Center. The interior is quiet and comfortable. Major bonus points for having no TV's blaring. This is a place to have a real conversation over lunch and a beer. The service was super. They were very attentive."}
{"text":"This place kinda has a hipster vibe.  They play folk music, which I like.  They serve very unique menu items.  I had never heard of a pasty prior to going there.  Its a baked pastry with some sort of combo of ingredients inside. The outer crust reminded me of a chicken pot pie.  The seating is different. The tables are so long and the benches are pew-like, you could potentially share a table with some strangers.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of at this place is that the pasties are pre-made and you cannot customize your order. For instance, I ordered the Vegetarian Greek and I HATE olives but I could not get mine without them.  So I ended up just picking them out as I ate.  I also got the potato-leek soup, which I love and many places don't serve.  It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Who knew what a pasty was, or that they are amazing! They are like large hand pies filled with complete meals. This is such a wonderful place. They have a wide variety and even many vegetarian options. You can't help but feel good when you are there. As good as the food is, the experience is equal. It is a very relaxed environment, and by the way, a great list of beers."}
{"text":"This is some tatsy biznass!!! Get the Reuben and call it a day!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much as carnivorous as a T-Rex but my girlfriend is a Vegetarian...a combination which sometimes makes it hard for us to find a restaurant that has something for us both.  We also like to try places that are 'different' as well.  That's why when we randomly wandered in to Cornish Pastry Company we were definitely happy and surprised.  First off, the place has an hole-in-the-wall feel to it, definitely a cool Blue Collar working Pub atmosphere that seemed unique and not kitschy.  The menu has so many delicious options too...plenty of meat filled pockets for me and Veggie options for her and each meal is definitely filling.  I had never had a Cornish Pastry before and the little bit of British history on the menu added to the experience.  The Pastries are pretty much like giant Hot Pockets...but giant hot pockets like your grandma would make if she made giant hot pockets..IE: delicious, filling, natural, and did I say delicious? stuffed with all kinds of meat, veggies, mashed potatoes, spices, etc.  Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Finally! Downtown Phoenix gets to experience the wonderful Cornish Pasty's that the world has been indulging in for hundreds of years. The downtown quarter has needed this unique restaurant and drinking establishment for many years.   In one weeks time it was packed, service was great and the owner was constantly working to make great customer experiences and train his staff.   I appreciated their soft launch menu to ensure they could handle the volume and make all the hungry guests happy.   The food was so good we ordered a third to split and we're so full we forced ourselves to walk away from dessert.   Highly recommend this entire experience."}
{"text":"To get this out of the way up front, the storefront picture here appears not to be the Tempe location. Maybe it's the Mesa place?  The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \"kitchen\" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.  The employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.  At $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.  The place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).  Bottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Hands down this is one of my favorite \"off strip\" food locations in Vegas. Filled with a unique blend of locals and downtown dwellers, this minimalist, hip (yet non-pretentious) establishment is a pure delight. Remember to come hungry as the traditional pasties are thick and rich and will fill you up in a hurry. We tried several different types and they all were delicious. Make sure to check out the divine dessert menu as well..."}
{"text":"Truly awesome food, and a unique option in a sea of tempe's Thai, Mexican, and pub food dominated restaurant scene. While many pub classics exist on their menu, I've yet to see a pasty on anyone else's menu, let alone one as good as the ones at Cornish. My personal favorite is the chicken rosemary, with a side of HP sauce. Oven chips are a good appetizer, since it'll be about 30-40 minutes before you get your food. Awesome selection of import beers. Service is good, even when busy. Only downside is that they feel a bit overpriced, considering how much side dishes cost and no combos are available. For two people ordering pasties, 2 beers, and two sides, expect to pay around forty or fifty after a tip and tax. That said, you'll leave full!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be better. Beer, great music. Hard workers.  Had the bangers and mash with mushy peas... And the Royale with Cheese... AND the Reuben. All very, very tasty. A+ for ambience, too. Great music, and sitting in the kitchen bar adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty if you were a woman I would take you out and treat you right. I would send you flowers and write you love notes. I want you to bear my children and grow old with me. CP call me sometime I miss you everyday we are apart."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance great. I did not love the pasties like the ones I grew up eating in Detroit or even at the Pasty company in Los Alamitos California. The Great thing is the food is really good, just not what I expected."}
{"text":"I finally went here to eat after hearing a lot of hype. It's good, but not amazing. The food is tasty, but I was not blown away. However, for $9, you can't go wrong. I will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here after walking around the Art District. We LOVED it! Such a cozy and comforting environment. The food smelled AMAZING right when we walked in. We both have never had pasties before. I ordered the Vegan Florentine one and he ordered the Shepard's Pie (with beer, of course!). They pasties were so delicious! The florentine reminded me of a calzone and a pot pie combined. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been a longtime customer and the food remains excellent but the customer service needs improvement. We had angry students serve my family  last week, one of them literally slammed our dinner plates on the table. To Go orders are  what I'm doing  from now on."}
{"text":"Meatballs wrapped in bacon!!!  Need I say more?  Waiter was prompt and courteous.  The atmosphere is a dark corner pub with really good Cornish food.  Really good food.  There is plenty of beer to choose from, both on tap or bottle.  The beer is served at the right temp.    Did I mention the bacon wrapped meatballs?"}
{"text":"This place is good, but not nearly as good as my friend said it was. Basically it is just a really good hot pocket..."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere. A little difficult to find, but worth it.  The plaza they are in is run down with a  hidden gem inside The Cornish Pasty."}
{"text":"Pass-tea...not pasty as in nipple tassels or the other term for pale.Every time I come here there's always something I've set my taste buds on having but it's not available. One time, it was banana beer. Another time, it was chicken tikka Massala pasty.  But the service makes up for it. The times that I've been here, the servers were very friendly and chatty. The recommend substitutes for what I want but they didn't have have been great. No banana beer, I got to try ginger beer. No chicken tikka Massala pasty, I got to try veggie tikka Massala pasty. Both of which I probably would've never tried.  Crabbies Ginger Beer:  From Scotland. Very sweet and a mild taste of ginger. Ginger is good for you. Sold by the bottle. 5/5  Strongbow Hard Cider: Your typical apple cider. An apple a day, keeps the doctor away. On draft. 4/5  Banana Beer: From England. This is hard to find even online. Total Wine is out of these beers until who knows when. Your neighborhood grocery store doesn't have this. It's super delicious. Like a banana dessert made better because it's beer. This is currently my favorite beer. Sold by the bottle. 5/5  Veggie Tikka Massala Pasty: I love how I couldn't tell I was eating something vegetarian. I'm a huge carnivore so for me to like this is a big deal. The red curry taste was fantastic. Very filling. 4.5/5  Chips with Garlic: Baked thick-cut fries...chips in English. They bake the garlic with the chips so you get a bit of a burnt garlic taste. I love garlic, period so it doesn't bother me. The chips are slightly crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Ketchup on the side. 4/5  Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding: You can get this with vanilla ice cream or Creme anglaise...or both. The bartender helped me decide between this and the PB&J pasty so you can guess which won out vote. Homemade bread, cream with alcohol. Slightly crisp edges. You can taste the alcohol. 3.5/5  Strawberry Pavlova: The presentation is very pretty and impressive. I did not expect something so pretty to come from a pub. It has a meringue base, cream, kiwi slices, strawberry slices and halved grapes with raspberry coule. It's light, fruity and creamy. 4/5  They have happy hour from 3-6pm and 10-midnight everyday and it's $1 off draft beer and wine. Mondays: 14oz cider for $3. Tuesdays: $1 off all bottled items. Wednesdays: $5 glass of wine. Sundays: happy hour all day. They have Rogue Hazelnut beer on draft - another favorite of mine. You can come here solo, with a friend or with a group - you'd never feel lonely.  The bigger tables to the left of the entrance are church pews. Something about that that makes me feel guilty so I choose never to sit there. The bar is the perfect spot so you can watch them prepare pasties."}
{"text":"Loved this place ...the service was amazing and was great .... I really love the atmosphere in the place in the field....."}
{"text":"Located in the same mall as Lotus of Siam, but across the way, Cornish Pasty Co. was a delight. It feels like a local's place. There were a lot of people with their families and just hanging out after work.   With recommendations from our server, we ordered baked fries and two pasties: the Pepper Steak and Cottage Pie. Often when I eat pie/other things with crust, I wonder if I could have just disaggregated the two components into crust and filling, then eat it together. But this just worked really well! My favorite of the two was the Pepper Steak. It had some sort of cheese inside that just went so well with the meat. The Cottage Pie was good, but I preferred the Pepper Steak because I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes inside. That being said, everything was so good! And very filling. If you're a normal eater, you can just order one and be pretty stuffed.   The service is friendly and hardworking. The chef behind the counter makes pasties like a machine and it's pretty entertaining to watch him work because he's so intense about it. All in all, I would return! The menu was exciting enough for me to come back and try one of the weirder ones, like Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"This place is great. Always a good atmosphere. They have meals for my friends who are allergic to beef and chicken and have vegan dishes. There's literally something for everyone. The downtown location has 3 floors which is cool.  I usually get the chicken tikka masala  and wash it down with an IPA. Great service with a smile."}
{"text":"Cool decor. Good servers. This place is usually packed but worth the wait. I was told you can call ahead for special orders. They have some yummy vegan options without meat and dairy. I don't care much for the vegan spinach and cheese but the Indian one is delicious."}
{"text":"I thought this place was quite fun and unique. I had the rosemary chicken pasty, and while it was good, I found that I wasn't crazy about it with the brie cheese. Other members of my party had a wide selection of the pasties, and overall we were very happy. Portion size of the pasty is quite generous, and I believe most, if not all, come with a dipping sauce.   The beer selection was great. The only disappointment was they did not have black current to do a traditional \"cider and black\" from England.   Overall, definitely worth a visit for locals and non-locals."}
{"text":"The pasties are amazing. My two favorite are the Mexican and the Pilgrim. The Mexican has amazing flavor from hatch chilies, steak, potatoes, and egg with fresh salsa and sour cream. It's like the best breakfast burrito you've every had because that buttery flaky pasty crust can't be beat. The Pilgrim on the other hand is like that delicious meal you make the day after Thanksgiving with all the leftovers. It has turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes. It's delicious by itself but with the wine gravy and cranberry sauce it's become out of this world! It's like what a chicken pot pie wishes it could be and you'll be thinking about that wine gravy sauce at Thanksgiving wishing you had some.   Lastly, for dessert, and no meal at Cornish Pasty Co. can be complete without it, the chocolate bread pudding. Now you may be saying \"But Connor, I've had bread pudding and I don't like it.\" That's fine. It's literally like no other bread pudding. For starters I'm fairly certain the \"bread\" they use is cake. Secondly it's not cooked into a complete mush or gel. The layers of delicious sweet cake are clearly evident when you get it. About four layers on each one typed with creme anglaise and ice cream. Each bite is incredible."}
{"text":"My wife was in Tempe yesterday and picked up two pasties for me, a traditional and a more fancy Chicken Tikka Masala. I ate the traditional last night and it was the best pasty I have ever eaten. I am an Englishman who has eaten a huge number of these delicious pastries, I think the key was the pastry, in England they tend to have too much and not enough filling, this was not the case at the Cornish Pasty Company. Can't wait to eat the second one tonight. I can only review the food, but I will be visiting this location very soon. We need a location in the West Valley!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is knocking the service, this is my second time here and she has been pretty good. The food is fantastic and I'm looking to come back many more times. The Irish working class theme is a nice touch without being over the top."}
{"text":"I just got finished eating half a Pilgrim (that's turkey, sweet potatoes and dressing in a pasty and can only be described as a gift from the heavens!) so I figured I'd give a quick update; food is still amazing!  We come here all the time now - the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup is a staple, ever single order.  Even in the heat of the summer, I still want it.  I'm working my way through the pasties and trying different ones frequently; every one I've gotten has been just terrific.  An unexpected favorite is the Lovely Bit of Salmon, which is just amazing, especially with the sauce.  Service is still very friendly and knowledgeable; a couple of months ago my roommate and I were sitting at the bar and one of the servers was breaking down a half box with a weird ingredient (I think it was like, coconut milk).  I asked what it would be used for; the chef behind the bar that prepares all the dough for the pasties said it was actually a transport box from Costco, because \"nothing in this place comes from a can - we make it all.\"  Yes, yes they do and it shows. Down to the fresh baked bread for the soups, which I now have to order extra of every time because my roommate can suck down 3/4 of a loaf of it.  My little container of cranberry sauce that came with my Pilgrim became my dessert tonight - it was homemade and it was. That. Damn. Good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and didn't realize they had one downtown. I normally go to the one in Tempe but this place is just as good. I was really intrigued with the way this building was set up. It's a two level building and on the second floor they have a place we're you can shoot some pool or play darts. It's pretty spacious and I could imagine coming back with a group of friends for happy hour too shoot some pool. Other then that, their Pasties are the shit!!! I've had a plethora of pasties from here and I don't have a single complaint. My favorite ones are the Chicken Pot Pie, Italian, Carne Adovada, and The Royale with cheese. Excuse me for moment as I wipe the drool on the side of my mouth. Lol. Their service is also outstanding and often come check up on you to see if everything is ok. Kuddos!"}
{"text":"Go there...go there now!  What are you waiting for? My Cornish pasty was one of the best I've ever eaten in the world, and I'm from  pie capital of the world (the UK) so that's a pretty big compliment!  Don't let the slightly dodgy neighbourhood  (okay, I'm being nice here, you are certainly not in \"Kansas\" any more) put you off, and to be honest the black painted restaurant front lacks a little (again being nice) curb appeal.  Just go in...I assure you that you will not be disappointed with the pasties!  Ok, so I am going to speak to the service but I am not putting the blame for the slow service and lack of a \"MUST HAVE WITH PASTY\" side.  The onus belongs on the owners who are clearly over working their one waitress during peak times.  My colleague and I arrived around 11:30 and about 4 tables were full.  Then a table of about 8 arrived. So I wouldn't say the place was packed out.  We waited about 25 minutes (and I'm guessing here) for our food, but it was WELL worth the wait.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful and was doing the absolute best she could on her own.    My biggest disappointment was the lack of mushy peas.  If you've never had mushy peas with your pie (or pasty) then you have never lived.  We're not talking your bog-standard garden pea variety here, these are well-cooked, sloppy marrow fat peas that \"mush\" once cooked (yep, no masher involved here!)  They are a perfect accompaniment to your pie or pasty (along with the most delicious gravy). Despite having mushy peas on the menu, my hopes were dashed when I was informed that one of \"the partners\" didn't make the peas yesterday (yes, this sloppy, side dish of scrumptiousness takes a LONG time to cook).  So, after crying a little into my diet coke, I put on a brave face and ate my pasty without the mushy peas.  As I said, one of the best I've ever tasted!  i had the original (The Oggie) and the best in my opinion.  If you've never had a pasty before, get the original - it's truly a masterpiece!  So, to the owners - get yourself some additional help and get the bloody mushy peas on every day!  I gave you 5 stars because of your amazing food and the service was great but slow, but I can't blame the waitress for that. So, if fellow yelpers make it to the bottom of my diatribe, they can decide for themselves if they are willing to put up with slow service and missing side dishes for an AMAZING pasty (yes...PAST-Y, not PASTE-Y)"}
{"text":"Where am I? Brooklyn? Portland? This place is hip! The staff must skateboard to work because several boards have been left leaning against the bar--one even with a flannel. Btw, the staff are awesome.   Food? Yum! So yummy. Pasties are a new culinary treat filled with deliciousness. I'm so full from eating one and sharing another with a friend.   Wine and beer? Great selection!   Decor? Love it! Great for a date or a group. The big tables manage to feel intimate due to the low lighting and large space of the restaurant.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pasties are awesome with a wide selection. Food takes a long time, even the appetizers.But with a large selection of draft beer, with a drink in hand, time is never a problem among friends.   I grew up in Michigan and was born in the UP of Michigan. I grew up eating Pasties. These are fricking good...."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  Wish I could have sampled all of the options.  So good!  Staff was friendly.  Only downside is location. It's in a run down, almost looks deserted, shopping center."}
{"text":"First off, the food here is so god damn delicious it should be a crime. The pasties, chips, soup, broccoli bake - all of it is good.   The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the service and seating setup. Most of my friends understand that eating here is kind of hellish and is usually to be avoided. The seating is very limited - if you're claustrophobic forget it. If you come with more than 1 (2 at the absolute most) people, forget it. There are two booth-table hybrids, way in the back, but be warned that your server will inform you that at any time, no matter how awkward, complete strangers are allowed to just plop down next to you at the same table and join your party. If you are a Larry David type individual with a need for personal space, you're gonna have a bad time. If it fits, they sits.   As far as the service goes, the soup de jour is \"I don't give a shit.\"   One time we asked for straws and our server just chucked them at us. I've asked \"do you have any seats available?\" and been told \"I don't know, go look.\" We've had employees actually ask us to move, along with all of our stuff, to a different table (yes, really) to accommodate another group. I've been given dirty looks for asking for a slice of lemon in my water. All kinds of heartwarming interactions.  I haven't been to the other locations, but if you're a masochist that loves gourmet hot pockets this location is for you. Otherwise either get really drunk before you eat here, or just get it to-go."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty-everything we had was very good-but the service was non-existent to begin with, but picked up after we complained. Typical college decor (dark, grungy and loud)."}
{"text":"There is no point writing a full review with all the good things people have already said (accurately) about Cornish.  I only write to rank my favorites:  1) Carne Adovada 2) Peppered Steak (omgcreamybrandysauce) 3) Spicy Asiago Chicken 4) Pesto Chicken  P.S. GET THE BANOFFEE- I DON'T CARE HOW FULL YOU ARE.   Only request- more beers on tap please!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place out. Walked in and were ignored for 2 minutes. When they caught our eye, they turned away. Went next door to Rosita's and were seated right away."}
{"text":"Ok, wow.   I'm so glad a local friend recommended we check this spot out when I was visiting from Philly. The parameters I gave said friend were \"I want good food in a lowkey dark bar that won't care if I'm in today's sweaty hiking gear.\" That's what I got, and then some. The place was described as divey but I'd say that none of the negative connotations of that term apply, and only the positive ones. We sat at the bar and enjoyed scotch egg, wings, and two pasties. The chicken parm and the chicken tikka masala were so good I ate until I was in pain..   This place makes the must-go list for whenever I return to AZ."}
{"text":"Eh it was okay we had the shepherds pie vegetarian style. The ambiance was like 80s punk dive bar which was cool but the food was meh. It wasn't terrible but we weren't blown away either. The service was decent."}
{"text":"This is where I take out of town visitors and first dates. The atmosphere is pulled together while also laid back (dark and lit by candlelight but black Sabbath is playing in the background) and the food is unique. Each pasty is it's own experience of varied flavors and textures; it sound simple, but pasty is where I take people when I want them to feel special..minclhding myself when I want a tasty beer and a pasty."}
{"text":"Came here twice recently so this review will cover both times.  Pros: the new restaurant is awesome. Still have the awesome church benches from the old place. This place has an unfinished warehouse kind of vibe to it in a good way. The pool tables are a nice touch. The chips and scotch egg are both great apps. The desserts are all amazing. We tried the apple and cinnamon pasty, good. The Pavlova is amazing. The sticky toffee pudding is incredible. And the banoffee pie is also amazing.   Cons: there are several. First off, parking is non existent. It's essentially street parking which makes it terrible. Both times we went they were out of almost everything we wanted. I think half of our order the first time was unavailable so we had to order different pasties that were not out first choice. Also the first time we went they were completely sold out of the sticky toffee pudding which was my main reason for going. So for the second time I called them around noon the day we wanted to go. They said they only had like 8 puddings left for the whole day so in order for me to get them for our group that night, I had to give them my credit card info over the phone to have them hold the number of puddings I wanted. That same night they were sold out of even more pasties than the first time, but at least I had my sticky toffee puddings.   I'd like to give them benefit of the doubt with all the issues we had with nothing being available due to the new location and the growing pains associated with a  fresh move but after two different nights and the same issues, the frequency of us returning will definitely decrease.  Go for the desserts and don't expect much else."}
{"text":"Was on the way to Houston from CA, and stopped by to eat here at the CPC, and damn it was really really good! I think it's a sin if you pass up this place when in Arizona.  Kinda confused cause when I walked in, but you can either sit at the bar or tables w/ the menus already on there.  Think about it this way. You'll have the best hot pocket ever. and only in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I love Cornish pasty  The bartenders are all knowledgeable and the food is amazing. However on a Saturday lunch I feel like I inconvenienced my server by showing up to a restaurant to eat food. The serving staff for this restaurant seems vacant and unenthused during lunch hours   Chefs are cool tho"}
{"text":"Great bar!  The Carne Adovada pasty was heaven!  We ordered the meatballs and the parliament wings. Dipping the balls in the parliament sauce made them even more yummy!  The music was legit too!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what more I can add. Perfect space with a mining vibe. Perfect 80's metal soundtrack. Perfect fresh ingredients cooked on demand. How this place ended up in Phoenix - a suburb of Phoenix even - rather than the Village or Tribeca is amazing. Don't forget the apps: curried potatoes!"}
{"text":"Glad there is a separate bar on the other side of the place that is actually in the kitchen!  If you can get over the motley types (both customers and staff lol) this is one of the best dive environments in the valley.  Think low class Brit grunge...Lemmy would have hung out here."}
{"text":"It was great again, so good I'm coming back again, soon! KELLY was my bartender and server, she made it a fun and great experience. The food was good and so was the beer! 6/7.  Came back again, I know I was here yesterday, but the food and beer is amazing. This time I was helped by Ian, another great bar tender and server. Had two of my favorite beers, Firestone Union Jack and Double Barrel Ale. They just told me there's one in Vegas, I'll have to take the wife!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I ordered veggie chicken tikka masala. It was really good. I usually get pretty full after eating half of the pasty but I was finish off my entire plate. It was that good. They provided a white yogurt sauce along with it which was delicious. A must a try."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We sat at a bar overlooking the kitchen it was great spot to see the cooks prepare the pasties. Service was friendly and we didn't have too wait long for our food thats a plus! This place is always packed with locals. It has a great atmosphere to chill, have a drink and enjoy some bomb food!"}
{"text":"If you know anything about the history of the cornish pasty, it's that miners used to eat it as meals; there's extra dough on the outside so that the could just eat it with their index finger and thumb - so that their food wouldn't get dirty (even though they themselves might have been dirty from the mines).  I know this because these mines originated in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula in Michigan); and I actually came with two Yoopers - my husband and his good friend. They grew up their entire lives eating pasties. Tough crowd! What's the verdict? These pasties lived up to their expectations! We each got a different one. Mine happened to be Thanksgiving themed; filled with turkey, a wine gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. I couldn't have asked for a tastier pasty. We also ordered a Shepard's Pie themed one, and that  had everything a hearty meal could ask for, lamb, potatoes, veggies. It was delicious!  The only reason I'm knocking a star is that the service was only OK. I waited ten minutes to get a drink, and our appetizer was brought out with our meals, which was definitely unusual. I understand we went during happy hour on a Friday, and they were short staffed, but still.  Overall, I would definitely come back again to get more pasties!"}
{"text":"Like some other previous reviews about not knowing what a Pasty was, I didn't either. The Pasty is SO good though. The atmosphere is great, service is fabulous, and the food topped it off. You can get something sweet or something savory and everything in-between. Definitely try this place out if you're willing to try something new (that's if you've never tried it before)."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Looking for a sandwich/calzone mixed with different things? I had the spicy Asiago chicken pastie which was amazing I split it with a friend who ordered the chicken tikka masala. Either one you can't go wrong with. I also had the 20oz beer which hit the spot. I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a meal that will make you want to take a nap"}
{"text":"Loved the bar side! Great bartender and solid grub. For me it's a spot I could visit multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Oh god. It's like GOD'S VERY OWN HOT POCKET. Fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, though I have trouble bringing myself to get anything but The Pilgrim (served with turkey, cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and deliciousness). Cornish Pasty is great, though you'll likely want to consider takeout: it's TINY and finding a table can be a real pain.  The staff is fun and helpful, even though they're quite harried, and the oven-roasted potatoes are fantastic, as are nearly all of the pasty options, all priced damn well, to boot. If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.  Overall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty is so full of awesome that it is really hard to describe it's awesome awesomeness. It's kind of hipstery so i can't say that i'm their target audience but whatever. I goes and eats where i please. I just throw a few butterfly sticker-tattoos on various parts of my body and blend right in.  I like places with a character and this place has it in spades.  The cooks/waiters/waitresses are friendly and the pastys are good eats!  I must warn that they are more filling that you would think.   Good beer good food! Ridiculously cheap (knock back a few Rogues for me) The dark lighting also makes your friends look sooo much better.  win win.  and win."}
{"text":"Beef is hard and chewy, and the dough is meh. Having had Cornish Pasties in UK, this doesn't even compare. I think they should make their menu with fewer, better choices."}
{"text":"The first visit, I was intrigued. The second, I became a fan. From that point on, I could not help, but tell people about this place. The concept of taking something as simple as a classic meat pie and filling it with some extravagant ingredients might just work. Well, of course it would work. The important thing is perfecting the crust that allows the fillings to shine.   For the most part, this does happen. Some of the pies are overshadowed by strong or overpowering spices, but overall they are delicious. The Porky, for instance, is overcome by sage. All of the other ingredients are taken over by this one spice. The Royale with Cheese is one of my favorites though. To have all of the best components of a cheeseburger in a handheld snack is amazing. My only complaint is the lack of consistency in their menu. Instead of doing such a large selection, maybe to offer specials on certain days or setting specific days for each pasty would make it easier to keep plenty. The soups have all run salty every time I ordered one. The sides are hit or miss. The oven fries with jalapenos and garlic are always delicious.  The beer selection is reasonable and affordable. Although it is not a huge variety, it is enough to over all of the bases."}
{"text":"So they are like hand pie's...for giants! Or for you food from the freezer type of folk...a hot pocket but so much better.  So the place is small, kind of divey but  in a good way. Love the booths, the benches are church pews. The bar is small but sufficient, beer and wine only. Our waitress/bartender (Mandi I think) was awesome, it wasn't too busy on a Sunday around 4pm. She was attentive and helpful, she was a hard worker.  We actually bumped into fellow Yelpers while we were there, Roger T. and family and Norm K. getting some pasties to go.  I was really in the mood for spice so I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and Doug got the Rosemary Steak. We shared some Garlic Fries. Mine was good, good flavor. The outside pastry of both were golden and flakey. Be careful the inside is hot, don't expect to pick it up and sink your teeth in. It was a good ratio of pastry to filler. The fries were garlicy as promised, baked nicely. Doug's was interesting, but it felt a bit salty to me. He ate it all happily of course with a nice English brew. We decided on some dessert, of course Doug got his pick of them because I knew all I could fit would be a few bites. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding...it tasted like a warm chocolate chip muffin with butter, it had some crème on top and ice cream on the side. I liked the crispy bits on the outside and Doug liked the soft warm center. We're such a match.     The prices were good for the amount of food you get.  I would love to go back and try more pasties and desserts!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, and the service is superb!  Wife ordered the Cottage Pie pasty--it was outstanding!  Don't forget the red wine gravy--yummm!  I had the Cajun pie--it was excellent.  We shared the Caramel Apple pie for dessert, and it was amazing!  Definitely go out of your way to try this place--you won't be disappointed!  P.S.  Tip to the owners--open a location in Northern California.  You will make a fortune here!"}
{"text":"Man this place is really good! Beer is excellent. Good service. I just really like general feel of the place. I had the bangers and mash pasty. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A must visit if you around. The food is great and they also have take away. The staff is nice and the food has premium ingredients. Every time I visit Vegas, I love to stop by this place at least once."}
{"text":"Been here 5-6 times and every time it's simply delicious.  They're not a typically defined pasty, but rather served with a flaky crust.  The fillings have lots of flavor and the sauces compliment them well.  Good beer selection too.  All this in a very casual atmosphere with pew like benches used for seating.   Only downsides are the parking and the restrooms.  Generally street parking and sometimes that means a bit of a walk.  Unfortunately, graffiti has taken over the restrooms and they are in need of repainting and some drywall work. Overall, I'd eat here much more frequently if I lived closer.  Too bad for me that I don't, but it's a must eat for everyone that is close by."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous!  It is within walking/stumbling distance of my house and offers car bombs for $3 all day, everyday.  Cornish is usually my default drink stop or eatery when I can't figure out what to eat. Menu is very robust and offers quite a few vegetarian offerings, which is very different and they are actually really good (this coming from a non-veggie).  My favorite is the non-traditional royale with cheese, but I haven't found one I don't like and I've had almost every single one.  They added some side dishes recently to accompany the pasty options and provides a bit more food than I can handle. There are quite a few beer options on tap with some really decent tastes of the UK and others.  I love being able to find Boddington's on draft and they have it here in 32 oz. mugs!  Again, DANGER!"}
{"text":"What a place to eat.  I have never had anything like it.   It's baked meat,cheese,  and veggies in delicious bread.  I was looking forward to the pate but they don't have it in Vegas.   The waitress was incredibly efficient and did a great job."}
{"text":"After living in the UK for many years, I was a bit wary of someone trying to bring me to a pasty shop in Phoenix, but off we went. Huzzah!! These things are great. Yeah, not exactly like the real version, but great in their own right. Lots of crazy options, something for everyone. Love it."}
{"text":"Brand new place, great beer selection, and delicious pasties. I'm always looking for something new, and this fit the bill. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great concept who would have ever thought that a restaurant that makes a 100 different types of British Pies could be successful.  But here you are with this place that blows away anything you would find in Britain that's for sure.  This place has a very eclectic atmosphere that's about the only was to describe it.  IT's got this very long bar area that goes along two rooms and the center of the bar area is actually the kitchen where there a handful of people making these pies all into the night.  I think I was there close to 12pm once and they were still making and baking these pies.  It's actually fun to watch.  The place is dark and loud so if that's not your thing than you might not be a fan but I love it.  All the pies I've had are really good and they do make a least 2 vegan options but they do run out sometimes so just be prepared.  There are also a very large amount of vegetarian pies with fake chicken and meats.  I had an Indian Vindaloo one that was really good and had a nice spicy kick.  All of the pies will come with a side of sauce for dipping and it really ads flavor to every bite.  The service here is top notch considering all the people and commotion of people making pies around them.  The people who come here are all pretty social especially in the bar area.  I've had people buy me drinks here because they are being friendly. Speaking of drinks they have a great beer and wine menu and it's reasonably priced.  Overall this is a place is a must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The Missus & I are traveling together this week (yay!) and stopped by the Cornish Pasty Co. for a quick dinner.  Nice English beers (and cider) on tap - kind of a dive-y ambiance.  Let's face it, we all LOVE finding an out of the way place with really good, reasonably priced food, don't we?  It just tastes better!  CPC delivers on all counts.  It's kinda loud (but I liked the music, so that's OK :) and kinda dark, but that's OK too.  Pasties are English pies miners would take to work for their lunch.  The Missus had the Shepherds Pie pasty (she had the ground beef, but lamb is an option, as it should be) and I had the Indian curry pasty - two big hits!  The pie is crusty, golden brown and delicious outside, nice and delicate inside.  Fillings are yummy, service was great!  The House Special pasty has rutabagas in it, which I despise, and the friendly server was most apologetic that they couldn't take them out, but said if I called ahead they would be glad to remove the offending root veggies with some advance notice - nice of them to offer to accommodate my distaste for root vegetables in general (and rutabagas in particular).  In summary: great, interesting food, friendly service, reasonable priced - we'll be back and I recommend you stop by as well, and see what this whole pasty thing is all about!"}
{"text":"I've sampled enough to make a well rounded review now. The restaurant itself is rather scaled down but still too nice to be considered a hole in the wall. The seating is all hard wood benches and tables. The bar provides a nice view of the kitchen.   Pasties: Lamb and mint: accompanied by a red wine sauce that pairs nicely. The mint isn't overpowering at all while the lamb is very mild and not gamey at all.   Chicken tikka: great flavor of spices and peppers and onions. The spiciness was a bit too hot for me but still tasty  Lamb vindaloo: nicely cooked tender lamb, spicier than the tikka pasty. If you like spicy things you'll love this one   Chicken pot pie: exactly what you'd expect from a delicious homemade chicken pot pie. The veggies are cooked to perfection without being mushy or too crunchy. The gravy that accompanies it is yummy chicken gravy   A bit of salmon: probably my fave so far.  The salmon is moist and not overdone, the potatoes add a perfect balance offsetting the bright flavors of the asparagus, roasted peppers and dill.   The Sticky toffee pudding dessert is gooey sweet salty heaven. I shared this dish and it quickly turned into a race to get more on my spoon. Amazing toffee sweetness with spongy cake and calmed by a bit of cream. This is quite possibly one of the best desserts in town."}
{"text":"Amazing might be an understatement. From the front - a bit undiscerning - behind the doors is nothing but goodness. We had the Royale (cheeseburger and fries) with thousand dressing and the Carne Adovada. Neither disappointed and at a pound a piece - incredibly full of flavor and filling. The oven \"chips\" garlic and jalapeño were just perfect. Cannot wait to come back and try one everything."}
{"text":"Awesome location, both in Chandler/Mesa border and also the Tempe Location...   1st experience in about 2008 in tempe.. Lil crowded for lunch, but well worth it went a few times, then in 2010 experience Chandler/Mesa Newly opened, great look and roomy even though still packs the place, but what do you expect for the great food. Finally made it back out to the tempe location and WOW, they renovated and definitely more room, and guess what ? yes Crowded still..   I have tried almost every Non-Vegetarian Pasty, and loved them ALL.   Favorites are, Cheese Steak, Steak and cheese, Pepper Steak and the Adovada..   1 That i didn't like was a misplaced order on a very busy day and ended up somehow with shepherds pie pasty,, thinking that all the pasty's are great,, cant go wrong,, but should have known as i don't like any shepherds pie that it may be a bad call to keep it... lesson learned.   Working in area and hitting this place about once a week.  Keep up the great work !!!  OHHHH and the BEER..... great selection,, i suggest the RAJ IPA"}
{"text":"A very unique place indeed. Its a narrow corridor with a kitchen on one side and bar and tables on the other. Its interesting to sit on the bar and watch them making the food. The food itself while being really unique was  above average. I would like to give them 3.5 stars for the food and another star just for the layout."}
{"text":"Everyone I know (who is under the age of 50) LOVES Cornish Pasty Co.  It is great for meat eaters, vegetarians, beer drinkers and winos.  They have kept the menu simple and everything they make is prepared fresh-- right in front of you.   My recommendations- start with a large salad-- it is huge and the lemon dressing is terrific.  To drink it's fun to get a snakebite-- Cider+Guinness.  Go for the vegetarian \"chicken\" tikka masala pasty with yogurt dipping sauce all the way!!  Keep in mind, it is just about the most hipster place you can imagine, so you can't expect bubbly customer service, but go for the food- it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Cornish Pasty twice but both times it was fantastic. The first time I shared their signature pasty, the Oggie, and the second time I got one the Veggie Spicy Asiago. The Veggie one was so awesome I ate the whole damn thing and that's a lot of food!! They also have an awesome beer selection. The only semi drawback is that they take awhile to make."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been to the one in tempe and love it as well. This location is new and the resturant is beautiful. Love the bar top. Pasties are amazing and give my grandma's homemade version some competition. Always a stop for us when we leave vegas. Check this place out. Great beer and wine selection and has some cocktails."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Every time! Great ambiance in the restaurant! Tomatoe soup is killer"}
{"text":"Come on, come on now? Don't tell me you haven't been to Cornish Pasty yet. Tonight was first Friday so the joint was jumping a little harder than your average Friday. We arrived to a full house. None the less we still were seated In under five minutes by a cordial host. I won't be the only person to tell you just how delicious these pasty's are. Tonight I had the vegan buffalo cauliflower pasty.....cauliflower, black beans, corn, peppers and vegan cheese. 100% delicious and satisfying. For a side I ordered the baked beans and added jalapeños to really get those beans a jumping. They were the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. Ultra tasty. They had a special on St. Archer tonight $5 pints so that's what I washed my meal down with. (White ale and IPA)  I didn't catch our servers name but she promptly took our drink and food order and checked in on us often to make sure we had everything we wanted or needed.   Tonight the house was packed and the ambience was loud, happy and a party good time vibe. Oh and did I mention live music? Well yes you heard me right, live music to top it all off.   I was too full after dinner to partake in dessert but I'll tell ya though the selection is good and will satisfy the sweetest of sweet tooth's. My style is to go in for beer only, food only, or dessert only. I just don't have room for all three in the same visit.   Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"Never had a pasty before coming here. I'm a HUGE fan, now.  Girlfriend had the Shepard's Pie (with lamb) pasty and I went with the Oggie pasty. We started off with an order of Mushy Peas. For dessert, we had the Apple Cinnamon Pasty and Chocolate Bread & Butter Pudding.  Everything we had was so delicious! My girlfriend said it looked like I was having a food-gasm. (I think I was) The pudding ... oh, my ... the best I've ever had.  The food here is OUTSTANDING. The beer is nice and cold. The service is great. The atmosphere is perfect for a British Pub. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Another delish outing at my favorite whole in the wall.  Three pastys and two Liters of beer for under $50.  Cheap and satisfying lunch for my work force!"}
{"text":"Another great Yelp find. What did we do before Yelp? We suffered through boring, run of the mill restaurants. This little gem, however, is tucked away just off the strip. Great food and good beer selection. My first pasty and I loved it!  I had the Mexican. My husband, who loves pasties, had the meat and cheese. Great!"}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere! All at our table were very pleased with their Cornish Pasties. I would easily recommend any of the great sounding Pasties on the menu. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Wow, never have I though that pub food could be this delicious. Cornish Pasty Co. is by definition a hole in the wall well worth driving too from any where in the valley if you are seeking simple, affordable and downright deliciously satisfying food.  The menu is impressively varied, from typical, premium to signature pasties. I went with the lamb vindaloo and its spiciness left me goofy with delight.  There is no host/hostess at the entrance, so you can either seat yourself at the bar, and you can even hang your purse from underneath the counter!  The service is warm, friendly and efficient. Dinner for two without drinks was a bargain at $ 25."}
{"text":"I just adore this place. First the food - omg everything on the menu is to die for. I love the tomato soup, the cottage pie pasty and I'm always tempted to get a dessert but am too full - they look delish tho. The ambience is so sweet: melty candles in old Jameson bottles, warehouse ceiling, great rock and roll oldies. Lively place for darts and pool too. Good beer selection - I can't find one thing to not love about this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Gem.  So fresh.  I order to go. but next time i will eat in. The out side is very intimidating but give it a minute inside.   The food speak by it self.  Full of flavors and a lot of options.  Even the Vegi menu have a lot.  The service was great, Kendall, great server, attentive, great customer service and friendly.  KUDOS to the chef who make this Master piece of Pastries."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  A usual lunch spot for me and my team members.  After the expansion things were slow for a bit while the staff got the kinks worked out, now it is great!"}
{"text":"I thought the pasty was yummy, the one I chose at least. I ordered the Carne Adovada [$10] - comes with salsa and sour cream. It was realllyy good. My friend ordered the Lovely Bit a Salmon [$11], which had some kind weird herb to it and made it taste unpleasant. I don't think the accompanying sauce helped much. The pasty is also very filling. I ate half and I was pretty much set.  The interior is dark as all hell. I walked in and I nearly bumped into someone. It's probably the darkest restaurant I've ever seen. Each table gets this tiny light that comes down from the ceiling. I can't imagine eating inside.  So we ate outside on the awkwardly too big wooden tables and sat on the immobile seats that are placed too far from the table.  The waiter was very chill. Too chill? Like skater boy chill.   I read that the other locations are better, so I would probably eat at one of those places rather than the tempe location."}
{"text":"Four stars, but I knocked one off because the pasties are pre-made and you can't ask for substitutions.   I've been here twice. I will definitely go back, and I've recommended this spot to friends, but I was pretty bummed to find out last time that I can't ask for more of this or none of that.   Seating is VERY limited. Unless you're going to be there the minute they open, I would call ahead for take-out. If you're dead set on satisfying a craving, you'll want to call ahead to make sure they're not out of whatever you want, too. We found that out the hard way.   All in all, it's a tasty spot. Best for take-out."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for awhile...it did not disappoint! Food was excellent and staff was very friendly. We will be back for sure. My husband wants to make his way through the beer list and pasty menu."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was a little spotty.  The pastie was very nice, but the server did not know what beer that they had.  The neighborhood is slightly sketchy, but fine during the day.    There were 4 of us and the bill was about $52 including drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great spot downtown. It definitely has that hipster vibe. The staff is very friendly and attentive. No hostess stand when you arrive, so it is a bit odd just standing at the front door. But the staff came very quickly to seat us. I ordered the Cornish Meatballs, Chicken Pot Pie Pasty and Lamb Vindaloo Pasty.   The meatballs were delicious. The mustard gravy and bacon were a treat. Highly recommend for a starter. If you just want a snack these are great too.   The Chicken Pot Pie Pasty was good. Rich and creamy and full of flavor. My only dislike was the gravy was too sweet for my liking.  The Lamb Vindaloo Pasty was delicious. Got a good kick to it and full of flavor. Would definitely order that again.   They also have a large selection of beers, tap and bottle. And great pricing for large glasses too.   This is a great place to have a good moderate priced meal before heading out for the evening. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Having lived in the UK, I was really excited to see a pasty restaurant in the States. The ambience was spectacular at this place; the service was fabulous; the smells eminating divine; and the price awesome. But honestly, the pasty dough was very thick, and the filling lacked flavor. I got one of the veggie pasty's since they use Quorn faux meat and that's my favorite veggie meat alternative, which I've never seen in a restaurant! But definitely lacking flavor. The leek soup was the same; very thick and lacking flavor. Would go back here and try again, but not the best pasty's I've had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We found it on Yelp and is a 4 1/2 out of a 5. We were watching Jacob making a \"Pasty\". I highly recommend this place...it's a place you won't just find anywhere."}
{"text":"Good variety of menu items and very unique and different type of food. The salmon filled one is surpisingly my favorite. All the sides are great too my favorite is the mashed potatoes. Everything I've tried is great and even though some of the pasty combinations sound kinda weird it's all worth a try. Only reason I docked as star was because the first time i tried the sticky toffee pudding it came out burnt."}
{"text":"I don't think you can make a wrong choice when picking out a pasty here. Each one tastes so good and the liquor selection is great. Lots of space inside but wasn't a fan of parking and walking there in the middle of the night. Maybe a little more lighting in the front"}
{"text":"Three stars since I've been there once.  What I like is it's spacious, with soothing lights both bright and dimmed, a variety in moods of music I like without splitting my ear drums. And if you're lucky there's top secret juggling to be seen. I felt comfortable as the staff was friendly. (There was one kid with tood but he recovered. Also the decor was classy."}
{"text":"Such a great experience to get my kids to try something new. Only suggestion is maybe not to go on Sunday evenings without asking what they are out of. My son wanted to try a few different things and all 3 they were out of."}
{"text":"Gourmet comfort food at its finest. I love this place so much. Heavy metal music sometimes lol and a staff that you can tell are happy working there"}
{"text":"Got the bangers and mash.... Delicious. The red wine gravy is incredible. Took the food to go, bartender Kayla was super nice and accommodating. Food took longer than most places but who cares because there are so many things to do like pool and darts. AWESOME find!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love these fancy ass hot pockets. The rotating vegan options are always amazing and I am always happy to dairylapse for the Carmel Apple dessert."}
{"text":"Very good! They offer 32 ounce draft beers, $1 off during happy hour, most are around 8 bucks. The pastys are awesome. Had the cajun chicken with ham, bacon, swiss, and chipotle sauce, it was great. The pesto chicken with mozzarella, mushrooms, and artichokes, with marinara on the side was solid as well. Will return again. Small seating area, groups of 4 would be the max I would recommend without split seating."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years. I love all the locations but this original one is my favourite. All the food is made from scratch and prepared right in the open which is awesome. The food in general is phenomenal. I've never had anything that wasn't good. Always a great beer selection and recently a awesome growing liquor selection.  I had particularly good experience lately. Came in with my wife and sat at the bar and was greeted by Josh, one of the bartenders. He was very nice and very informative about everything, especially all of our questions about liquor and beer. He had of great information he shared with us and was able to make us some great classic cocktails that we never knew could be done there and he did them wonderfully. Definitely want to come back when he's working and see what else he can make for us.  It's great to be in a place with such great quality and none of the attitude you get from some places that projects a high end image.   I highly recommend stopping in if you never have."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food, good service! A hidden gem! Had the lamb pasty, delicious! Can't wait to try the tons of other options!"}
{"text":"If a simple cottage pie taste like your mama's comfort food, then can you imagine what the other Pasty's will make you feel? Love this place!"}
{"text":"$50 for a bottle of wine, apps and two bomb ass pasty's! I go once a week now with the new location!  Dylan was dope!  I love this place!  I tell all my friends...EVERY visit...trust me just get the Royale and they order something different and EVERY visit they say ok can I take a bite of yours then say damnnnnnnn so bomb!  GET THE ROYALE!"}
{"text":"I just went there for dinner this evening. I've never had a pasty before, but this place has been recommended to me many times. I have to say, it did not disappoint.   I got the Oggie and my buddy got the Italian. I never tasted rutabagas before, but i felt they worked very well inside the pasty. It was quite delicious, but i have to say, when i return i shall probably try something else.   My buddy said the Italian was great. It was essentially a calzone, but he swears it was better than any calzone he had ever gotten at a pizza place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. One of my favorites in Tempe. So many options to choose from. I recently tried The Pilgrim. It's Thanksgiving dinner wrapped in warm pastry bread. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the design of the Phoenix location. The ground level and upstairs have an upbeat vibe with more activity and louder music. The lounge downstairs is perfect if you want a relaxed atmosphere where you can easily carry on a conversation. The food and drinks are excellent and they're open late. A fantastic addition to the growing night life downtown."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a large assortment of pasties to choose from. A pasty is similar to a calzone, but these are of English influence. My favorite is the Gobbler- it's a Thanksgiving type dinner wrapped up in a pasty with gravy and cranberry sauce on the side. Mmmmm! Some other recommendations are the Shepard's Pie or Chicken Pot Pie. They even have vegetarian pasties. One important fact- you can't modify the ingredients. They come as they are and they are delicious!!"}
{"text":"stumbled in looking for some late dinner on a Monday night.  I was skeptical because from the outside it look like the lights are out and walking in it's about the size of a hallway with a small room on the end.  I'm glad I persevered.  The beer on tap  english and cold.  The pasty menu is impressive -25-30 types.  I chose the Veggie chicken tikka masala.  Nice spice and served with yogurt.  I'm not sure ti's worth the money without a side of some sort but it was damn good and filled me up especially when paired with a couple 20ouncers.  The staff is cool and the music choices rock.  i know I heard some Nick Cave and some Tom Waits.  Left with an order of oven baked fries.  Cooked beautifully.  only complaint is that the jalapeños shold have been some kind of covering instead of served next to them BUT that said the peppers were fresh and hot and minced so fell nicely into the ketchup.  Can't wait to try and grab some for the flight back tomorrow night."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I remember hearing about this place coming from Arizona to Vegas. I asked on the forums here and I even emailed the company. Alas awhile ago they opened and everyone let me know. Due to work I haven't been able to make it until last week. Finally I experienced the deliciousness that is a pasty!!  In a little unassuming shopping center you will see a sign reading Cornish Pasty Co. And when you walk in there's a slightly dimmer place. As your eyes adjust you see the cool pictures on the wall and unique furniture. They greet you politely and now you can explore the menu. On the menu there is the history of the pasty which I say you should read.  Now a pasty is like a hot pocket but these are huge hot pockets. They have a great selection including vegetarian pasties! I'm a meat guy and this particular day I wanted some Indian. No worries since they have a Chicken Tikka Masala(red curry) pasty. Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes. With a side of mint- yogurt dressing or tahini. Man it was soo good. Eating Indian out of this flaky crust. My mouth waters thinking about it. My girlfriend got the Lamb Vindaloo which had lamb, potatoes and spicy vindaloo sauce. With a side of mint-yogurt or tahini. As a side for us we got the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Potatoes. If you love garlic and red potatoes roasted you will love these!  Now Dessert time. My girlfriend got the shirley temple dessert with a twist. Sticky toffee pudding, made with imported British treacle, served hot with crème angalaise, or ice cream. Oh man it was so sweet and warm with the ice cream made it so good. I went for the apple caramel pasty. Apples, cinnamon, and caramel baked inside pastry. Topped with ice cream and fresh cream. I look forward to eating this on a cold day or even our hot summer ones. That's how good it was.  The service was super friendly and the food amazing and unique. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Company has great food.  The only thing is to get there early because when the place gets busy the service becomes slow.  The decor is nice and dark which is nice to get out of the sun now and then.  I had the Lamb with mint pasty and also the salmon pasty, both tasted awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food. I'm not a huge fan of how dark and loud it is inside (Tempe location), but the food was great and our server was top notch. She even let the 5 of us have our own checks without a bat of the eye. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. My husband and I stopped by for dinner tonight. We both had the Oggie and were impressed. The seating situation was a little awkward, with just the two of on a long church pew. My husband didn't want to sit on the bicycle style metal chairs. But seating aside, the overall experience was great. The service was good, although I felt our server paid waaaaaay more attention to other customers who were ordering and sampling different beers. Our server was nice, though. And most importantly, the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooooooooooo good. We just got carry out and are already planning our next trip back. We all grew up in Michigan where up North you can get Pasties at a lot of places , none of which come close to the quality and taste here. Seriously go here , you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Holy moly, why have I never heard of the pasty for the so many years I've been alive!?  Simply put, the pasty is the premium version of an empanada....and a super deluxe version of a hot pocket.    The boy and I drove here Saturday night around 8:30. The place was packed, and we waited about 15 minutes for a place to sit.  We were, as many others have mentioned, confused about where to go to get seated. A guy beyond the counter told us to just find an empty table to sit. I tried his technique and was stopped by another guy who told us to wait, and he'll get us a table.    I asked our server to see what's the most popular pasty, and he said there is one single pasty that sells more than the other.  So I would just suggest go with what you're feeling for the day.  I ended up with The Royales with Cheese, and my boy got the Bangers and Mash.  The Royales is basically a cheeseburger stuck inside the delicious, warm, buttery crust.  It had a weird garlic taste to it, which I didn't care for. The thousand island that came with on the side didn't go well with my pasty.  I still garbled that thing up regardless though.  I tried a piece of the Bangers and Mash, and I'm not a fan of it. I don't normally like eating pork, so I wouldn't have ordered this.  The boy really enjoyed it though.    Now, unto the BEST part of the meal...this is none other than their Banoffe Pie.  I HAD to get this even though I was already stuffed.  I have never had anything like this. Thick, crispy graham with creamy, homemade caramel, topped with whipped cream and slices of banana.  I've got a sweet tooth, and that banoffe was definitely one of the best desserts I have ever had!  I would definitely come back to this place again and again the next time I'm back in Arizona."}
{"text":"This spot would get a 5 if their dessert was tasty. Ordered two different desserts and neither were tasty. Very appealing to the eye but not to the tongue. However, they were nice enough to not charge me for one dessert. BUT, they have an IPA there called the dragoon, it is a must try if you like IPA's!!!  I love this spot!"}
{"text":"Nice place with a laid back atmosphere where you can chill, get a drink and hang out. I can easily imagine that if I lived here I would frequent this place. For the basics, this is a British Pub that serves Pasty's. A pasty is the British version of a hot pocket or their take on the calzone, kinda. It is more crunchy and flaky, in a good way and they seemed to have figured out how to make them repeatably good.  After a full day of hiking and walking around in the sun and sand of the Arizona desert we decided to stop by here for some much needed good food. My friends swore by this food, but I was a little skeptical as I am not the biggest fan of flaky things as main course. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and it was awesome. I completely loved it. They did such a good job with the flavors and the pasty also complemented it very well. I might end up ordering this exact same thing if I go there again. My friends had mentioned that the Pesto Chicken Pasty is also very good and might be on the list of things to try next.  We tried some deserts also. We had the Strawberry Pavlova and the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding. Both were very good and worth having again, but I have a bias towards chocolate so will say that I loved the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding a little more. The warm, moist and flavorful inside with the crunchy and yet flavorful outside made for a killer combination. It tasted very good just by itself and also with the pudding/ice cream.  I look forward to going to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I recommend it to anyone who wants to eat something that is not inside the norm.  This place is very vegetarian friendly! It also has a few vegan options but you usually need to call in and put those on reserve earlier in the day or the day before you go (that's the only downfall).  The fries are also very good! I have always gotten good service as well. I highly recommend it.  My favorites are the TIkka Masala pasty and the Pesto \"Chicken\" (Both of these are vegetarian options so all the meat is soy meat)"}
{"text":"I broke the first rule of restauranting. I went somewhere named after their specialty item, and ordered something else. That's right... no pasties for me.  But, I have an excuse. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding - homemade bread, baked in chocolate brandy sauce until crispy on the outside, served warm with vanilla ice cream. Who looks and that and doesn't think, \"I want that inside of me\" immediately? Nobody.  When I ordered it, the waiter replied with, \"You know what makes this even better? If you ordered a shot of Rumple Minze (peppermint liqueur) and dipped your spoon in it before every bite.\" As if it needed to be better.  Now I might never get a pasty from Cornish Pasty Co., but gaddamnit, rules were made to be broken. And warm chocolate bread and butter pudding, alongside melting vanilla ice cream soaked in booze, was meant to be inside me."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I've been here a few times already and I've never had a bad experience, and the food is absolutely great! We ordered the portobello chicken pasty and the reuben pasty, along with two beers. The food comes fresh and hot, and everything in the pasties are so flavorful. I ordered a 16 oz beer, but they ended up pouring a little extra. Instead of throwing it out, they just gave me a 20 oz instead for the price of a 16 oz. Super generous of them. One pasty is a bit more food than I prefer to finish in one sitting, so I usually eat half and take the rest to-go. Half a pasty is plenty to get full off of, especially if you're having beer with it as well. The service is very good, staff extremely friendly and casual, and very knowledgeable about the food and the extensive selection of beers available. The interior is a bit on the darker side, but the lighting is adequate. You can sit at the bar in the center of the room (but you have to order food as well) if you are keeping it casual. If you'd like more privacy, there are tables (with candles) along the walls.  I would definitely come back as often as I can. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown, this is a great place for the working person, student, or juror to grab a meal.   This place was pretty packed when my fiancé brought us here for lunch. We walked up to the upper level which was dark and had a great pub feel. We took a seat by the windows and waited for a server to come around.   Service: it took a while to get a menu, but once they came, they returned frequently to check up on us and grab the order. Service isn't the fastest here, partially because it's a more casual environment, and partially because the food takes a while to make.   Food: its worth the wait. We ended up getting the Pilgrim after we were told that they were out of the Bangers and Mash. These Cornish pasties are humongous and delicious. We split the one pasty and it was the perfect lunch, but maybe on the lighter side for my fiancé. The thing is, they're dense meals, so be prepared to feel heavy if you end up devouring the whole pasty by yourself (which is always so darn tempting). Sharing is recommended.  The Pilgrim was excellent and filled with a savory mix of stuffing, sweet potatoes, and turkey. Covered it gravy and cranberry sauce, it was too good. Hello Fall.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Having only been here are few times I can tell you that when I find myself in Tempe this is the first place that pops into mind when someone asks, \"Where do you want to go eat?\"  With as many reviews as this place, it appears to cover various aspects.  What I will further drive in is the fact that this is quality scratch food.  Be patient this is not some Hot Pocket fresh out of the microwave. It is real food.   Pasties are not the only thing on the menu.  They have a great selection of salads and soups.  Vegan, veg whatever...they got you covered...."}
{"text":"Laid back deliciousness.  Comfort food for the soul.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fairly inexpensive, lovely atmosphere, large portions....my favorite is the cajun chicken...yum-O!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. My husband and I love British food and this is the place to go if you're looking for it. We ordered the Oven Chips as a starter and they were amazing. Great taste, crisp and fresh. We ordered the Porky and the Shepard's Pie pasty's and both were phenomenal. The portions are huge, and everything was so tasty! Great taste, really amazing food. The atmosphere is very nice and they have a great selection of beer on tap. We will be back!"}
{"text":"All the food is well prepared and tasty, just keep in mind the pastys are pre-made so you won't be able to special order anything, what you read is what you get. The atmosphere is nice and quaint, just a little too dark inside for my liking. Friendly staff and just as suited for large groups as it is for a couple in a date. If you haven't tried it, you definitely should."}
{"text":"I moved around this place in September and have become a regular since but after tonight I don't know how much I can say I'll be coming back.  I sat down at the bar waiting for my call in order, and decided to order a beer. Got my beer, and then bartender proceeded to tell me that I should check out this \"dive bar\" and was saying people like me would like a place like that...? (The way he said it was as if he intended to offend me but I didn't get the reference because I have never been there).Then we got our food and he walks over and says \"you want some shots before you head over there (the bar he referenced), you know we're a bar we got plenty of whisky shots for you\".. Dude had a red beard over a foot and a half long with no tie, no nothing.  I've just been in this industry for over 8 years now and honestly haven't seen someone do something so offensive to a customer in all my time. The whole time the dude had his friends sitting at the bar next to us.. Thanks for putting us down just for a laugh!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  If you've never had a pasty, think of it as a huge empanada.  If you've never had an empanada, think of it as the biggest and best gourmet hot pocket ever...and maybe think about trying some new restaurants :)  Choices, choices, choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce, potatoes, peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.    I'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!  Then there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!    Check out the menu: http://www.cornishpastyco.com/menu/"}
{"text":"Having lived in the UK for 10 years, on my first visit I was a bit worried that the pasties would not be up to scratch. Sooooo glad to say they are extremely good! I'm partial to the \"Oggie\" and have it every time b/c it's so delicious! I ask for extra sauce too, love it   You can also buy pasties (as in 'past' not 'paste') to cook at home and they come out really well: just follow the instructions on the package they wrap for you. If you like beer there's a very comprehensive menu to satisfy all tastes. Vegetarians and vegans are also catered to, with special pasties full of veggies and other good things - I haven't tried those so can't judge, but from the standard of the ones I have had, I'd say those must be very good too. Have room for dessert?? okay then, I highly recommend the chocolate bread and butter pudding: yummy yum yum! of course the other desserts are great too, they even have a peanut butter and jelly pasty ....so bon appétit everyone and try not to get too addicted to these delicious concoctions....& if you don't already know why, read about the origins of the pasty while you wait for yours"}
{"text":"OMG this place was soooooo good and I can't wait to go back for more. My boyfriend and I were headed out to Tempe a couple days ago and I asked him to Yelp some restaurants in the area. He mentioned pastys and all I could think of was pasties that women wear, anyways, I figured that if Yelpers gave it a great review it must be good. As you walk in it is kind of small, yet intimate. Are SUPER tiny waitress came over to take our order (She was super cute and small). My man ordered Cajun Chicken and I ordered the porky pasty with a Boddingtons. MMMM the food came out nice and warm.  I have to be honest that I liked the mans more than mine, his dish was a little spicy and it came with this chipotle style spread that pulled all the flavors together. The porky was good, it reminded me of pub food I have had in Edinburg, Scotland. It was gravy filled with lots of potatoes and meat.  Needless to say, I felt like I needed a nap afterwards; however, we decided to share the PB&J desert and it was GREAT!  Hands down the warmest best PB&J I have ever had.  We ended up paying around $30.00 for 2 bears dinner and desert, not bad."}
{"text":"All I can really say is WOW!  I absolutely love this place... The Carne Adovada is by far my favorite, and a close second is the Spicy Asiago chicken.  The service is always great, and the renovations they've made to the joint are wonderful - it's really a very pleasant place to visit."}
{"text":"Tiffany loves cornish pasty co. Why is it a pasty and not a pastry? I'll never know. But if Tiffany loves cornish pasty co, then I love cornish pasty co, even though cornish pastry co makes a ton more sense, but you can thank Tiffany for not getting dinged on the linguistic mind fark, Thanks Tiffany! So mr pasty co if you see Tiffany give her free beer and Pastys (pastries) and don't spike the drink, just say thanks Tiffany for being a loyal lover of pastys .. whatever the heck that is ... I'm pretty sure it's a form of pastry ..."}
{"text":"Came back to this gem.... And I have to say.... Pav game is on point.... Just saying. Well done fellas."}
{"text":"It is rare to give a restaurant 2 stars when they prompt you to literally throw up. But that is a testament to the pasties being quite good. My partner, who visited the restaurant with me, commented that one chef appeared to \"hate his life\" as he moved his hands between food preparation and a sweaty brow. As a result, my partner opted against ordering meat (which he said looked rancid). At the time I thought this was melodramatic. I was wrong.  I ordered the Peppered Steak pasty, which I devoured hungrily. Over the next 5 hours I became gradually nauseous. Let's just say (5 hours later) the food was less tasty on the way back up. At least with food poisoning, the symptoms end abruptly with the elimination of the rancid food. I was back out on The Strip two hours later (i.e. 7-9 hours after eating said pasties), but opted to drink instead of eat my dinner.  [Updated 7/31/15: Thanks to the business owner for the facts from the CDC. It seems they reaffirm the likely explanation of food poisoning. But in all fairness, I bet this was a freak occurrence, and the food was great. And who knows, perhaps it was actually the Southwest Airlines honey-roasted peanuts I had eaten 15 hours earlier.]"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's hard to find vegetarian/vegan options that aren't salad in a lot of places. Not so here- there are so many choices it's hard to pick what I want! The pasties are large and very filling. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the smokey patio. I enjoy patio seating but it's just not possible to sit on their patio without being overwhelmed by the smell of cigarettes."}
{"text":"I came here a while back based on the reviews from yelp. The place is a dark bar with little seating on the side. The vibe is a cool hang out. It was very dark so I can't be sure but the place didn't seem very clean...  The menu was so creative! Everything comes as a Pasty which is like a thicker skinned hot pocket!! yum! The flavors are tasty things like curry or pesto chicken overall it is good but I feel the baked shell is a little thick and the whole thing tasted quite doughy. Maybe I'll give it another try?"}
{"text":"Get the side dishes or the. soups. They are great and delicious. Also sit at the bar. It's fun watching them make the pastys live."}
{"text":"The food at their Tempe location on University was amazing!!! I was able to eat lunch during the week and the pasty was so delicious!! I love coming here for a nice place to grab a lot of food for a little price!"}
{"text":"Really good food awesome staff. A definitely have to try the pastys excellent place .."}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome! Great beer selection! Cool vibe, love the basement! Met the owner, he is a great guy who cares deeply for the quality of his food. Keep it up guys! Glad you are back to the full menu!"}
{"text":"Yum. Pasties with the seam on the top, and tasty fillings on the inside. The interior of the restaurant was spacious, and when I was there for lunch the servers were staying busy. There is currently a lot of road construction in the neighborhood so finding parking in the nearby area was difficult."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I highly recommend.  I love the theme of the restaurant and the food is incredible! Great quality!!"}
{"text":"All the flavor what else can you say. If they didn't let people smoke on the patio and I didn't walk into a drunken Uni student urinating on the outside patio door ( no lie) This place would be 5/5"}
{"text":"What the hell are you doing with yourself if you live in Vegas and haven't been here yet??!! I've tried almost everything on the menu and I leave happy and full every. single. time. My favorite is the Cottage Pie, but make sure you get the Oggie if you're a first timer; it's the original Cornish Pasty!! They also have vegan and vegetarian options if that's your jam. Dessert are good as well, they keep it simple with piping hot cakes/ pies topped with ice cream. The bartenders are generous and they definitely know what a long pour is. I love that they're open late night; my friends and I have stumbled in here many a drunken night after downtown or going to Velveteen Rabbit just down the street. And you can still keep the party going bc they have Irish car bombs for only $4 ALL. DAY. LONG. Good food, pool tables, strong drinks and hot bartenders. You can never go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences we had in Phoenix. And what a surprise, without Yelp we would have never found this wonderful \"hole in the wall\" in a space the width of a bowling alley. I had The Italian which was Pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes & marinara wrapped in a delicious pastry shell. Imagine a gourmet hot pocket. Mmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"My friend first took me here soon after it opened. Since then I've been hooked. I looooooove the food. My husband and I frequented often during the cooler months (Pasties are definitely a winter meal!).   I'm a big fan of \"The Pilgrim\" and \"Shepard's Pie\". The crowd is low-key and casual and the staff are friendly and accommodating. The only gripe I have is that sometimes the wait can be extremely long. I'm sure a part of it is prep and cook time, but sometimes I feel as though I've been forgotten about. Ordering out takes care of this and it also keeps you from having to wait for a seat during the lunch rush.  So glad to see local businesses like this introduce new food and culture to the mix."}
{"text":"Yyyuuummmmmmyyy new location 4weeks new. Nice and roomy. Cornish Pasty Co. now open hurry on down. Haven't left and planing next trip."}
{"text":"The second I walked in I felt immediately cool. I just moved back to hometown Vegas from a five year stint in NYC so my newly acquired city girl foodie habits have been met with basic disappointment at every turn in the desert. I crave great atmosphere, delicious out of the ordinary foods, and babe watching opportunities in my dining experiences and Cornish did not disappoint.  My date and I split jalapeño chips and each ordered our own pasty. He: the Italian and me: the chicken pesto. Omygoddddd. Deliciousness in every bite. Nice and dark dining area. I'm not a beer fan but they had amazing banana bread beer and I was in heaven.   Also to be noted, at first I assumed the pretty tattooed girls bar tending and waitressing might be bitchy to me or something but lo and behold they were sweet as pie and twice as nice. Struck up a nice little convo about the somewhat obscure female fronted hardcore band on my tee shirt and made excellent snack recommendations as well.  And again big ups on these hipster hot pockets. The servings are huge which means leftovers wooooop. Can't wait to go back. Bonus points for being open until 11 in my neighborhood... Can there eventually be a delivery service for my lazy hungry stoner ass?"}
{"text":"Pasties here are always great! So many options, even for my vegan friend, and a lot of places to sit. Food is always quality and the beer selection is par for a down town Tempe spot. The atmosphere is pretty hipster and the staff look like patrons, so if you like that you will like the service. Service can be a little  slow depending on how busy it is but the interior decorators have done an amazing job with everything and each location. You will always be satisfied with  choosing to eat here."}
{"text":"So, I've been here many times and have not left a review. The food is generally really good and this review is mostly in regards to to-go orders. This is the 2nd time I've ordered the food to go during my lunch and my order has been completely wrong when I get it back to work.   Today I ordered a chicken ceasar salad. I was asked if I wanted it \"mixed\" together and I said, sure. So I get my order, get it back to my office and it's a salad in one box, dressing on the side...and a full, un-sliced chicken breast in another box. Okaaay....maybe \"mixed\" didn't mean what I thought it meant..oh well. So I pour the dressing on the salad and it's ranch, not ceasar. Not a huge deal..just not what I ordered. So then I go to cut up the chicken breast and it is definitely slathered in spaghetti sauce. So now I have a ranch salad and a spaghetti sauce covered chicken breast. Awkward.  Because my lunch hour was almost over and I was starving, I decided, fine..I'll just eat them separately and call it a meal. Both were awful. The chicken tasted like it had been reheated and the salad was wilted. This is a bummer because their food is good every time I eat there so it may just be a takeout issue. So for that reason, I recommend eating there - no takeout!"}
{"text":"In short: Outstanding.  I recommend the Cornish Pasty Co.  The moment we (my wife and I) walked in we were greeted by both waitresses.  We felt welcome immediately.  The bar/restaurant is dark and intimate with a modern English type theme.  Although I did not partake in the libations this trip, it appeared they had a well-rounded selection of beers.  The kitchen is located behind the bar area and is almost a show kitchen.  It appeared that everything is made to order from fresh ingredients.  Our waitress was wonderful.  She was polite, attentive, and patient explaining the menu.  We started off with one of the four soups on the menu.  My wife and I shared a bowl of the hearty mushroom, walnut, and spinach soup.  It was served with homemade bread and butter.......Delicious.  I would go back just for that alone.  We also ordered a pot of English tea which complimented the entire meal.  My wife ordered the Philly Cheese pasty and I ordered the Shepard's Pie pasty.  Before I go on, a pasty is in the calzone family.  The main difference is a pasty is more of a pastry shell versus a heavy pizza dough.  Now that I can compare both, I choose the pasty.  Anyway, the Philly pasty was stuffed with square chunks of beef and accompanied by green bell pepper, onion and cheese.  It was served with a side of a mustard-dill sauce.  I stole a bite from the wife and it was delicious.  The Shepard's Pied pasty was everything it was billed to be:  Seasoned ground lamb, mashed potatoes, and cheddar cheese.  This was served with a side of red wine sauce which complimented the dish perfectly.  OMG......terrific!  Only one complaint........there is no wine menu; however, upon leaving, I mentioned to the caring waitress that a simple wine list is needed.  She seemed very interested and wanted to champion this task.  Now that's an employee who cares and I want her waiting on me in my future visits."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit the Pasty.  First, it is in a hard to find location if you aren't familiar with the hidden restaurants inside commercial center off of Sahara. Situated right next to Komol, the restaurant does indeed have the feel of a pub with the center of attention the beautiful bar.  I came here for lunch and there were about 3 tables full and 3 people at the bar and one waitperson to handle all of us.  As a result, it appeared she was the proverbial chicken with her head cut off, often scurrying past me several times before taking my order, bringing my check, etc.  I have to hand it to her though, she managed to keep my tea filled and was friendly! She had excellent knowledge of the menu and the popular items.  Word of caution: if you only have an hour lunch and it takes 15 minutes each way, don't come here unless you order ahead, this place is not quick, and that is probably because the pastry shell needs time to cook.  I watched them prep my meat and cheese pasty and it takes time.  The pasty is filled with large chunks of what reminded me of square meatballs and a cheddary cheese.  I have to say, I was expecting to be disappointed and not have much filling inside like so many calzones and empanadas I have tried.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised as my pasty came filled to the brim and I killed 3 days of dieting in one meal.  The red wine gravy was excellent!  All in all, the unique offerings here coupled with the extensive pub brew list (including strongbow cider) puts this restaurant on my regular rotation.  Sure there are some bugs to work out with the service (A customer at the bar said yesterday they had 6 waitpeople) and if you don't want pasty, your choices are limited to salads and appetizers, but Cornish Pasty Co. is a welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"Caught me by surprise. One of the most unique menus I have ever experienced. Been 4 times at 3 locations and they were consistently well-staffed, practically invisibly well-managed, and DELICIOUS. A great friend introduced me and I'm your huckleberry if you try it yourself."}
{"text":"Drove 30 minutes to get one of the vegan pasties.   Sat down, ordered a beverage and asked what the vegan daily specials are.  Server told me they aren't making any vegan pasties today and suggested I just get a vegetarian pasty instead.  Really??  NOT the same thing.   If you're going to put vegan options on the menu don't just decide not to.  Either make them or take them off the menu.   Major waste of my time."}
{"text":"How come I've never heard of a Pasty before?!  I was going to be in the Tempe area so I typed in \"dinner\" in the search box and this place showed up first with its 600+ reviews! And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!  Our group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly.   The broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish.   Overall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and bar! It has both an excellent drink menu and an excellent food menu. I always try to have a different pasty every time I go but I tend to gravitate towards my favorite ones which are the \"oggie\" (beef, potato, rutabaga) and the lamb&mint pasty. The staff is very friendly and have even been really kind and patient with us when I've gone with large groups. They can accommodate large groups on their patio, no reservations accepted but it doesn't hurt to call ahead if your group is large enough."}
{"text":"Spicy Asiago chicken pasty. That is where it ends. Absolutely delicious! This place has a good beer selection and offers these things known as pasties (the a is not long... It is not pronounced like those stickers you put on your nips... Thanks for the clarification, bearded bartender). You can watch them make the pasties when you sit at the bar. The bread crust is flaky and is stuffed with the pasty of your choosing (get the Asiago chicken!!). It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. They have plenty of vegetarian options too if you're into that. My boyfriend enjoys the Pilgrim usually. The interior is dark and it was kinda difficult to find the entrance LOL. Pretty hipster joint and the food is top notch. I don't think you can possibly be disappointed."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and it was silica a nice surprise! Supper yummy and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like to try new things, so far I haven't found a pasty that I didn't like. I think the Italian is definitely my favorite.  I personally prefer to take out or get delivery since the actual restaurant is pretty small."}
{"text":"Amazing food - had the lamb vindaloo.  I would drive back here from tucson for lunch it was THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"First impression....Strip mall, hole in the wall.    Door opens-I enter and notice that it has its own unique flare......and then the smell hits and I'm in love.  Once the food is delivered I realize no it's not love, I'm in heaven!!!!  Both locations are awesome.  Cheers to beer list"}
{"text":"Not as busy as usual but our waiter seems a bit overwhelmed and not really into working tonight. Service and \"charm\" is off tonight. Food is consistent and good though."}
{"text":"Once again, I violated the pact held in high regard by my co workers, the Ethnic Cleansing Day, a day where we all get together to try a new eatery that no one has tried and preferably culturally diverse.  I just couldn't resist after trying to hit up Komol.  I had no idea they were right next door to each other.   I heard rave reviews from the pasty kings, no not that kind of pasty (ie. Havasu/Sorting Break/need I say more). I do not frequent places East of LVB north of Flamingo, Don't ask me why.  You will find the CPC nestled in the once prestigious Commercial Center just East of LVB on Sahara.  There isn't very much out there, so hard to miss.  Just don't go wondering into the notorious \"Vista\" area.  The ambiance exhibits a low light atmosphere expected of most British Style Pubs.  The dining area consists of a huge island bar that accompany seats all around.  The majority of the other seating was made up of large tables and benches, some of which were sketchy at best (weight tolerance wise).  Otherwise, even as dark as it was, the lighting was more than adequate and provided a shadow barrier between sections to separate parties.  I started the day with a 20 oz. Boddington draft, while the wifey tried the iced tea, which she loved.  I was excited for the upcoming Pacquiao vs. Bradley rematch and needed to make sure I put some hefty cushion in the tummy for the alcohol waterboarding that was fiXing to take place.  Therefore, I opted for the Pilgrim while the wifey ordered the Shepard's Pie pasty along with a side of chips and mushroom/walnut/spinach soup.  The soup came out first and was hot from the assembly line, the chips (fries) came soon after.  The soup was rich and flavorful with different contrasts, but boy was it salty.  The same went for the chips, for some reason they seemed like they were rubbed and marinated with sea salt because it seemed imbedded in each bite.  We had to douse them in ketchup as an equalizer, believe it or not.  The fake siracha didn't help either, unlike with piroskis and enpanadas...call me crazy.  Without the Bodd, I would have shriveled like a slug since I would have been cured by all that salt.  Beware!  The pasties on the other hand were a hit.  They come sliced in halves on what looks to be served on some sort of ball peen hammered pewter dish, although, it felt skimpier than metal, either way it was a nice touch aesthetically.  The Pilgrim reminded me of the Bobby from Capastrami and is complemented with cranberry sauce and wine gravy.  The Shepard's Pie contained the normal mash but filled with ground lamb instead of beef, wHich was delicious but could have used more peas.  Overall, I would have to rate our experience on a high three, but not quite a solid four, due to the salty chips.  During my second visit I got the Bangers and Mash and traded half with someone for a Carne Adovado.  Yet, it was not enough to change my rating, so CPC lucked out with a rounded up score of four stars (in actuality a 3.75)."}
{"text":"I seem to be attracted to restaurants that sell fancy versions of my favorite cheap eats.. (hello Republic Ramen Noodles!).   Anywho, I decided to check out Cornish Pasty Co based on the fact that my friends seemed to go there a lot, and I had heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. Last night we went, around dinner rush. The place was packed and I didnt know it was a \"seat yourself\" establishment. Our server directed us all the way to the back where we shared a table with some other people. This place has a really cozy feel, its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people. I went with my boyfriend and his brother. I got the Lovely Bit o' Salmon pasty, boyfriend got the Meat & Cheese, and his brother got the Cajun Chicken. We also ordered the oven chips. It took a bit to get our food, but I didn't really mind. When we finally got our order, it was well worth the wait. The Salmon pasty (filled with salmon, asparagus, red potatoes, tomatoes and spinach) was delicious.. especially that dill sauce it came with. The oven chips were amazing as well! My boyfriend and his brother absolutely loved their pasties as well. I even got to try the meat & cheese.. WOW. So good. I'm a sucker for anything cheesy!   Atmosphere wise, the place is really laid back, I liked how a lot of the people there had tattoos and I didnt feel like myself or any of the people I was with were being judged..sometimes we get treated differently just based off the fact that we have tattoos at places which is a big bummer! I did notice this place must be a hipster hangout since I saw a gaggle of them going out the back door, hahaha.   I will definitely be back, as long as I'm good on my diet the rest of the week.. hahah."}
{"text":"There is a giant shopping center off Sahara, crowned by Lotus of Siam, many, many Korean Restaurants, a pool hall with a heavy Asian lean and more empty store fronts than Main Street in Detroit.   Smack in the middle of the center, on the side facing West, is this gem. Which I only discovered because I lost my kid's pet ferret (horrible, horrid parent) night before, and couldn't sleep due to horrific pings of guilt. So I spent all night reading Yelp reviews and discovered Cornish Pasties.   First off- \"pas-tees\". Not like what showgirls wear.   Ambience is sort of off and all over the place, but I hear they are moving across the street from defunct Bar and Bistro off Charleston soon.  Hipstering it up.   Beer on tap is awesome and so are pasties themselves.  Crust is delicate, buttery and not overbearing or too bready, and filling is DELICIOUS!   For anyone who complains about \"potatoes, an OBVIOUS filler\"- that's what pasties are in essence. Potatoes, rutabaga and meat. Everything else is variation on the theme and this place does it beautifully.   I ordered chicken tikka and LOVED the amount of flavor and the fact that the chef isn't afraid of heat. Typically, I stay away from all things bread and left most of the crust behind, but I wanted to taste it and boy, it was amazing. If you are not of pushing 40/slave to slower metabolism mentality as I am, eat up. My party had chicken portobello and liked it, but maybe not loved it as much as I did mine.    One sad, sad downfall is side dishes. We ordered the fries or \"chips\" with garlic. You know that bitter unpleasant weird taste you get from burnt garlic- that's how the fries tasted, plus bland. Mashed potatoes weren't that far behind in the \"do not order\" category. I really wanted to try the soup, and next time I will.   So do go, for pasties and beer, not for side dishes or church pews seating (yup), unless you are into that.    Prices are good, food is awesome (almost) and bring your own company. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found this place by walking around Phoenix downtown... Great service, awesome selection of brew and fantastic food! Will definitely come back next time I am in AZ."}
{"text":"The vegan/vegetarian selection here is awesome, and the food is SO GOOD.  Seriously.  I especially love the sauces that come with the dishes - each dish is perfectly complemented by the condiment it comes with, and it makes for a stellar bite!    Parking is kind of a pain, though."}
{"text":"Well baked hot pasty and fast service make dinning easy here. Tried their lamb mint and mediterranean pasties, and oh my, both are incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"Too many options to chose from! If they were as tasty as my Cubano pasty, then try them all.  Scotch egg appetizer was tasty, and the wings were fine. The music here was great."}
{"text":"I would recommend the chicken pot pie as my number one. It comes with a side of gravy, which is delicious, I also like their hot wings which are very good"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, although the service can vary from decent to poor; there have been nights where the waitress sits on her phone, blatantly ignoring customers.   However, the food keeps us coming back. Unfortunately every time we've been there they have been out of the desserts we wanted to try, but otherwise the food is spot on and delicious."}
{"text":"My pasty was better than the ones I've had in the Michigan UP. The Oggie (traditional) was delicious and filling. Definitely enough for two to share. The pastry was the highlight - buttery, thick, and yum! I wasn't a fan of the gravy because it tasted like thick red wine. Tomato soup was delicious and kid approved."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a very long time....even getting my fix in Tempe my former favorite location. We now have the best pasty place in the heart of downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"All their pasties are DELISH.  Side dishes are also awesome and they are super cheap!  What a great place for late night binging of awesome food and drinks.  Ambiance is just what a British pub out to be."}
{"text":"Best place I've eaten in my three weeks in the Phoenix area so far. Cool atmosphere and great music. Bangers and Mash Pasty was a perfect portion and just top notch. Banoffee pie dessert was HANDS DOWN THE BEST DESSERT I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE"}
{"text":"Update: the owner of this restaurant reached out to me to let me know that they have been working to improve their service and have made significant changes since my visit. I appreciate an owner who reached out to customers and I hope he has improved this location. +1*   Maybe it's me. I have tried several of the Pasty locations and haven't really loved any of them. This one, though, was particularly bad. Granted, I went here with a friend shortly after they opened, so maybe that was part of the problem. We arrived late -ish (around 9 pm). We ordered a Royale with Cheese at the suggestion of our waitress and a couple of beers. We then proceeded to sit there for over 2 hours. 2 HOURS! What happened? Apparently, they gave our food to someone else and didn't realize it. Then they ran out of premade Royale with Cheese Pasties and had to make a new one (or something). I have no idea, but we wasted our whole night sitting there. Then when we finally received the food, it wasn't good. It was super greasy. Not only that, but I wanted a different sauce to go with it and no one came to ask if we needed anything. Let me remind you, we had been sitting there waiting for 2 HOURS and then no one came to ask how the food was or to see if we needed anything...... that is insane. I just ate the greasy pasty without a sauce. The waitress ended up comping the pasty (but not the beers), so that was ok..... I mean, really I feel like they should have comped the entire meal given that their errors interrupted any plans we may have had that night, and their service was so non existent, we couldn't even cancel the order and leave.    PS the decor is nice enough, they have a decent patio, and their beer list was alright (though their draft beers were a bit pricier than other places around town)."}
{"text":"At Cornish Pasty, you get good food, drinks, and service. It's got it all. The pasties are what got me though. The inside is pretty dark but cozy. Not a place you'd have a meeting. They do have outdoor seating though.  Happy Hour: $1 off drafts  Service: The bartender greets you when you sit down and checks in on you at the right time. He's good at knowing when to stop by.  Food: I've been here multiple times, but my favorite has to be the Lovely Bit of Salmon that I recently ordered. I think the dill sauce and salmon combo makes this pasty special. They don't skimp on the salmon. Lately, I've been looking for options somewhat on the healthier side and I would recommend this. You get your omega 3 and a flavorful meal. The Oggie - plenty of meat for the meat lover, very delicious, recommend to dip in the red wine gravy sauce that comes out with the meal  If you live in Phoenix, you should try this place at least once. But that'll be enough because you'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"The service...oh man it was painful to watch our server not even pretend to not be annoyed by our presence. It was about 7pm on a Sunday evening. The bottom floor was dead. We had a group of five and captain sunshine was our server. He looked miserable, walked away every chance he got and made us feel bad for being there. Even after an attempt to strike up small talk to ease him up a bit he still looked pissed off. He kept saying \"I think we are out of that\" but never checked to confirm or suggest something else in its place. The food was pretty good. The chicken pate was odd and something I wouldn't order again. The rest of it was pretty good. The interior is really cool. I think had we not sat downstairs and had better service we would of enjoyed it more."}
{"text":"While living in England I became a fan of pasties.  This place take the humble pasty and goes to the next level!  You can get the meat and potatoes basic or experiment with many of the other flavors.  Delicious and fresh it's worth the trip.   Don't let the modest outside prevent you from getting a great meal inside.  The beer selection is quite good for a small place which is just a bonus after the food."}
{"text":"I have been to the Pasty Co. a couple of times since moving to Vegas 8 months ago. Every single time i am here it reminds me of how it feels to be in heaven. Lol, seriously this place is just amazing. The service is alway spot on, the staff is friendly and welcoming, the food is out of this world delicious, and the prices are just perfect for date nights with my beloved.  True story: this is the first place i took my girlfriend when we started dating and it has become a biweekly ritual to come here. Its our Cheers."}
{"text":"How do they make the pastry so English!? It's true, just one bite can transport you back to Blighty. I don't go for thre silly pasties (Chicken Tikka, Jalapeno etc) but instead opt for the Shepherds Pie or Lamb and Mint. I come here for one reason, nostaligic English comfort food and my god they deliver. The mushy peas are out of a can but that fine I like them too! If I lived nearer I fear for my liver as I would sit around all afternoon drinking the draft 1664 ... tempting but scary! This place is straight out of the top drawer but I have to ask what's taking them so long to open the second location on Dobson (or thereabouts)?"}
{"text":"A quote from my English husband,\"the pasty is awesome!\"  Everyone loved the food. The music is a bit loud but if you can bear the music the food is worth it. Not many options for anyone gluten free as everything but the salads and apps are in a pasty. I was able to enjoy a tandoori chicken salad."}
{"text":"I really just want to point out my experience to the managers, as I don't feel you deserve a bad review for this. But with two separate doors and a very unique layout you must know it's a confusing restaurant. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, however that should be a focus for your employees, realizing that every guest should be greeted and either told where to sit or to seat themselves. I awkwardly walked into BOTH entries and neither time did a single employee say hello or even look my way.   Forgot to mention that prior to arriving I called in to check that there wasn't a cover for the fight (most bars were charging if they had the fight on) and the girl that answered was extremely rude (customer service is SO SIMPLE... it pains me when employees are so bad at basic people skills)! It was hard to convince my boyfriend to even give it a shot after speaking to her.   So after this and the lack of acknowledgment when I walked in I couldn't do it. I left, and very disappointed because I truly wanted to give this place a shot. Maybe I'll attempt another location one day."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the fuss about this place. The restaurant itself is crowded, dark, and dirty. I should mention that I am a vegetarian, and they have several veggie pasty options on the menu but I find them to be heavy and kind of bland. Perhaps this is a better place for meat-lovers. One positive thing that I will say is that it is fun to sit by the kitchen and watch how they make their famous pasty."}
{"text":"Great cider, thats about it...just left after sitting there and being ignored. 1st we get told the apetizer will take the same amount of time as the main dish. Then we spilled a drink, had to wait 2 passes of our waitress to get her attention. When we finally did, she said she would be right back with a towel. 15 minutes later, she has taken 3 more orders in front of us and no towel. We ask to cancel our order and get tje check, only to be told your meal is ready. We refused the meal and paid for our drinks and left a 0 tip. Great to be ignored and left with a soggy table."}
{"text":"Really sexy, warm and fun environment; it's hard not to notice right away. The food is amazing, I had the bacon wrapped meatballs as an appetizer, holy cow amazing! The croutons at the bottom of the bowl was just extra amazing-ness! I had the royale which is basically a cheese burger version and it was unbelievably tasty. The beef is so flavorful (based on the similar taste both the meatballs and royale had) you probably can't go wrong with any of the beef dishes."}
{"text":"Okay, so shoot me - I was not that impressed with this place. I went here for a UYE with a bunch of other Yelp peeps and got to sample a few nibbles off of everyone's plates and nothing left me enthused about coming back.  I ordered the peppered steak pasty for $9.80. Personally, I feel like a lot of these items would have been nice separately, but together, meh, too much going on inside of the crust.  The zucchini in a pasty just gave the meal a weird mouth feel. Not my favorite.  While I can't remember some specific names, I believe it was the Italian that tasted like a mediocre calzone. Whatever you do, do NOT put their Sriracha on your pasty. It is not the Rooster Sauce that we all know and love, but a terrible impostor. A few of us could not get over that fact.  I also had a bite of their beans. Not what I was expecting, but not bad either. Oh, and if you're going to order a side, just know that it's going to come out WAY before your pasty so it will basically be an appetizer. Service is sloooow.  Honestly, this place is WAY overhyped, too cramped and too dark to make it worth the 9 gatrillion 5 star reviews that they currently are sporting."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is amazing. I never heard of this place and went for the first time with co-workers. It's a small-ish place with a bar in the center and tables surrounding. It has a somewhat \"hipster\" vibe.  They have these little pastry type calzone things that are seriously to die for. My friend and I ordered the Italian and Pesto Chicken. The plates are on the larger side but that didn't stop me from inhaling the food. The pastry type things come cut in half and most of them come with a dipping sauce. Both of mine came with marinara sauce on the side. I straight up grabbed that pastry and shoved it in the sauce like there was no tomorrow.  They were both very good but the Italian was my favorite. I couldn't stop eating even though I was full. I honestly haven't had something so good in a long time. This place is a freaking hidden gem. The area looks sort of ghetto where it is but once you go inside and it's like BOOM! Boom in a good way. You seriously need to try out this place. There are so many awesome things on the menu that I had a very difficult time deciding what I wanted to eat."}
{"text":"Great food! First time trying pasty, it was excellent. A perfectly baked pastry dough with a golden brown exterior, stuffed with so much goodness.  I ordered the lamb mint pasty, nicely spiced and served with a flavorful red wine sauce.  This place is a must try when in Vegas. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The best service , and honestly some of the best food I've ever tasted ! I wish they had one on California I would go at least 3 times a week. I would defiantly recommend to go eat here I had a great time."}
{"text":"On a constant search for year-long Thanksgiving meal offerings, Cornish Pasty hit a homerun.  Sweet potatoes, turkey, stuffing and soft sauteed onions with cranberry sauce on the side.  So fresh, so tasty, so satisfying (not the gross full feeling).  Would have been a full five stars but my date's draft hoogarden (he was so excited to see it draft instead of bottled) was warm.  That's a no no"}
{"text":"Great Design - Brilliant English Infusion & Food is Surprisingly Excellent. Had the Mushroom Soup and the Turkey, Cranberries, Stuffing Pasty, (Restaurants version of Thanksgiving in a Light Flaky Pot Pie variation (Pasty) I practically licked the plate. The Mushroom Soup was buttery, nutty and a hint of oil to be similar to truffle oil. I have yet to experience a Mushroom soup that I enjoyed as much as Cili Restaurant at Bali Hai Golf Course originally created by Wolfgang Puck - It was delicious!  The beer selection was fantastic and the Bar/ Broken Church decor was a great twist but the homage to the Miners was suburb - This is the Restaurant to visit regularly and frequently for a variety of reasons. The most difficult and subpar objection to The Cornish Pasty is figuring out where to park. So expect driving around the location to figure that out and then take a brisk walk.  That walk will be worth it."}
{"text":"YUM!!  I am disappointed that it's taken me so long to visit Cornish Pasty, because it's amazing!! The location leaves a lot to be desired because it faces a busy street (Charleston) in the Arts District and parking is not fantastic, but none of that matters once you get those meat pies in your grill!  The restaurant is HUGE! I haven't ventured to the back bar area because each time we've gone, we've had the baby with us. But this is where my hubby wants me to take him for his birthday this year, so maybe we'll get crazy and get a sitter!  I have tried quite a few things here, but there is one thing that I would go back for time and time again - the potato, leek and stilton cheese soup. Holy crap is it delicious!! All of the pastys I've tried have been tasty as well, and I look forward to trying more. They offer such a variety, as well as vegan and vegetarian selections. Maybe even gluten free? I am not sure, but wouldn't be surprised.   The service is always fast and friendly and they have an awesome beer selection. Overall, it's a great place - I would love if they would open a location in Henderson! :)"}
{"text":"I went to visit the location in Mesa, AZ.  It was my first time visiting Cornish Patsy. I don't even know what a patsy is but I wanted to do a phone order. So I called in at noon on a Sunday for a phone order. I ordered the Oggie since it seems like the popular item on the menu. I also wanted to try the oven baked chips, so I ordered that with garlic and jalapenos.   When I arrived there, it had a fun, vibrant bar atmosphere. I like the decor, I noticed the whiskey bottles had this icicles on it. I went to the cashier/front to pick up my phone order. The cashier was very nice and responsive to my needs. Since my order wasn't ready, he kept asking me if I would like a drink. The wait staff also seems responsive and quick to others.  In terms of the food, the oggie was delicious. It was my first time trying an oggie. The outside was baked nicely and crispy. It wasn't soggy. It had a nice crisp but soft texture. The inside filling was soft and the flavors went well together. The red wine gravy also added great flavors to the oggie. Gravy was slightly sweet but also savory, so it brought out the flavors of the onions, potatoes and the beef of the inside of the oggie. The oven baked chips tasted like typical oven fries. The added garlic was delicious but the garlic aroma/flavor wasn't as strong as I would like. The jalapenos definitely added a kick to it, I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy. I ate the fries with the jalapeno and found it to be very spicy. Whenever I had garlic with the fries, it was delicious but I wanted more garlic to it.   Oggie reminds me of San Francisco's version of a peasant pie but slightly bigger and the outside has more flavor to it. It seems buttery, flakely. The SF one reminds me of a pot pie without a crispy crust."}
{"text":"A great place to knock out your lamb craving (one that I tend to suffer from at least once a month.) I recommend the shepherd's pie or lamb vindaloo especially, but I've never had a bad pasty. The soup is amazing and often overlooked, too! Comes with bread that tastes and feels like angels singing on a cloud in your mouth. And the dessert pasties are amazing--I have actually cried real tears upon the arrival of my apple pasty.  Service can be a bit slow on busy nights, but a 32 oz Raj IPA never fails to make the wait an enjoyable one for me. If you like a quiet spot to sit, you'd probably be best off on the patio."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and both times it has been awesome.  A low key atmosphere combined with some original draft beers and throw in hot pockets on steroids and it is a good combo!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place has almost 400 reviews and sits at 4+ stars.   Right there says: EAT HERE! This place rocks.   Granted I like to eat at their other location: more room, out door seating, more romantic...etc. But every once in a while i mingle over here.   Their hibiscus tea is amazing, no sugar needed.  I love love their broccoli cauliflower bake as an appetizer. Fresh broccoli and cauliflower topped with a creamy cheese mixture and baked HOT. Their NEW soup...OMG...its a, shit cant remember its name, like a jalapeno red pepper corn something spicy hot soup. Its awesome! Only get a cup though, cuz you need to save room for their pasty.   I actually have a take out menu in my car, i am slowly crossing off everything i try. They have a large variety, so any mixture you may enjoy, they have. Take some time with the menu.   Desserts usually never have room for them..."}
{"text":"It was ok! Pasties was ok nothing to go out of your way for. But the 2 missing stars was for the mushroom soup, it was super salty that I couldn't eat it :( and I'm someone that add salt to mg food for no reason so go figure how salty that was, big fail"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! This was my first time visiting and I will be going back. I had the Rosemary Chicken and my Honey had The Italian. Delish!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try. It's a bit of a dark dive with ample counter / bar seating in multiple rooms for prep and cooking views. Check out the back bar with pool table action or outdoor patio at other end of the strip mall. :).   Nice (albeit limited) cocktail and wine menu, good draft choices and an expansive pasty menu. If you haven't tried a true Cornish pasty, that alone is reason to visit this spot; I've never seen a wider selection. The pasty is TASTY, that's for damn sure. Be prepared to wait. My Chicken Tikka Masala took more than 30 mins. But, it was rich and delicious."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite place of mine for a long time. There are so many great options on the menu, so it'll take some time to try everything and very hard to pick a favorite.  The staff is nothing short of fun and make dining in a great experience."}
{"text":"This is my guilty pleasure downtown late night spot. Fantastic pastys. My favorite is the Bangers and Mash. Good cocktails, quick service, free pool tables and darts. Three stories with cool dim atmosphere.   My boyfriend loves the IPAs and the Lamb and Mint pasty, and I always get the Bangers and Mash with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Just WOW! ... I love everything about this place from the lighting and music to the food and drink."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Honestly, I had no idea what a Cornish pasty was coming into this place and I was somewhat reluctant to enter until I was convinced to give it a try. I mean, a pasty is something like a calzone but with a flaky crust similar to a pot pie in texture. You then choose from their several selections of fillings and after not too long this wonderful breaded masterpiece arrives at your table. Pair the breaded deliciousness with a pretty good beer selection and a pseudo hipster vibe to get yourself a real unique winner for lunch/dinner.   Legit- Unique and delicious  The flavoring was near perfection Fairly prompt  Good beer menu  Friendly staff  Inexpensive  Lots of parking  Nice decor inside   Meh- Not the best location  Not much curb appeal"}
{"text":"HO-LEE-SHIT!!! This was AMAZING!!!!! To be fair and honest, this was my first time and I ordered 1 thing, the bangers and mash pasty. My review is based on that alone. I wouldn't know authentic Cornish from American fraud... but I do know AMAZING food for a fair price. I'll be back often and I'll bring visitors here regularly.  Well done folks!"}
{"text":"This downtrodden shopping center has another great restaurant.  Believe the hype.  The best English food in town.  Each pasty is unique, delicious and satisfying.  The soups are fantastic and the appetizers are amazing.  Who cares about service when the food is so mouthwatering (although my service was very good).  I like the rosemany chicken with real or faux chicken.  The lamb, steak, eggplant, faux meat and other pasty(s) are creative flavorful recipes, and this is a one of a kind joint not to be missed.  Kudos to pasties."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was excellent! Ordered the \"Bangers and Mash\" and the \"Thanksgiving\" pasty. Both were delicious! The pasty itself was not heavy at all, but close to a pound, so it was filling. The sausage used for the \"Bangers and Mash'' was full of flavor and very lean. Everything was very good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious vegan and vegetarian offerings!  Great beer selections!  Are there other places that you can get  A 32 oz craft beer for $9?  If I had a criticism, the walls are FLAT BLACK and it is a tad bit creepy.  But the food and beers rock!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and I thoroughly enjoy it. The food is served fresh and there's a nice atmosphere - however, it's always so dim and loud that it's really a moodbreaker. Maybe this is the reason I'm not into pubs, and maybe I expected too much, but the food is good and that's the good part."}
{"text":"We got a sneak peek at the new restaurant today!!  It's going to be beautiful!!  Wait till you see the gorgeous copper bar tops and the wooden pews that were brought in for booths. It is spacious and well designed. It looks like the best parking will be on Art Way east of the restaurant or across Charleston.   We can't wait for pasties!!  They hope to open on Monday, the 24th. Congrats on a beautiful new location!"}
{"text":"1st time in Mesa location had the \"Lovely Bit Salmon\" and it was fantastic. Last time in the Tempe location had the \"Vindaloo Lamb\" and it was a totally different taste but same result ... amazing!  Love the story behind the main/only course the Pasty! Perfect restaurant to try every item on the menu.   Also their soup/bread/butter appetizers are delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered two pastys as takout.  One was Lamb & Mint.  The other was Chicken Tikka Masala.    It appears to be a typical kind of bar and pub.  The pastys were very flavorful, but a bit heavy.  I guess this is what a pasty is.  My wife and I thought the pastys were quite good, and the staff was very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This modest restaurant offers a menu that is a throwback from the UK. I love the uniqueness of choices offered from traditional English pasties and some great side dishes.  They offer two pages of pasties with different fillings. I tried three different panties.  My favorite was Rosemary Chicken, it was fresh, a bit creamy and used the right amount of rosemary herb. An interesting and delicious side dish is the Mushy Peas. The heat is spiced perfectly. Also, I love the two soups I tried. My favorite was the Mushroom, Walnut, and Spinach. Great English recipes. I will look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"We were here yesterday on a Vegas Valley Food Tour.  I love the look of the space, kind of gritty, but with old church pews, very cool.  We had the traditional Oggie, which is a pasty with steak, potatoes, etc.  Really, really good.  The red wine gravy on the side was wonderful.  Then we had a dessert pasty, which was the apple caramel pie.  This thing was over the top!  So, so good!  I would come back for that alone.  Unbelievably good!  Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The recipes are biblical. Created by Mathew mark Luke and john, carried by the nights Templar and protected in the same vault as the Royale Crown Jewels of England. Yup. That good"}
{"text":"I got the Cuban pasty, almost the best thing to graze my lips..... get it...ommmmgggg"}
{"text":"I've never had a pasty before, but I ordered the vegetarian traditional and it reminded me of a decent tasting pot pie. I wanted to get one of the mock chicken pasties, but they didn't have any which made me a bit sad. The waitress also informed me that they are premade. The french fries with garlic and jalapeños were cooked a bit too long. The waitress was super sweet and helpful though which made the service great."}
{"text":"The best place for a late night snack or a mid day munch. All different Pastys for your all the different taste buds out there. Delicious unique desserts, great people and atmosphere. You can't go wrong with the great beer and drink selection either. Definitely a regular spot for me, my friends , and fam."}
{"text":"This was my second visit- this with my guy.  (First with my bf and her Brit Husband.  I had to get his approval, since I know little of pasties) ..more side notes-  I am born and raised in Michigan, the miners migrated there (upper) and took their Pasty tradition with-- but in my Ann Arbor area they were known as 'pocket pies'. OK on to the restaurant.  Wonderful, warm, stick to the belly food.  Brit said 5 stars by the way.  I have had soup, cant remember the name, delicious- salad- Greek, delicious.  Second visit- last Friday-I had the Vegan special- packed full of marvelous veggies and a salad- my man had the lamb and didn't say a word cause he was too busy eating!!  Yes - he wants to go back.  Also he is a dark beer lover and many places do nothing but offer the Mexican dark and Newcastle- but here he had not only darks, but some tap gems he also liked. I'm giving this 4 stars because the seats are tractor seats with that BIG hump in front (don't know how the guys like it) for me it was a bit 'in the way'.  If I wanted to scoot close to my guy or up to the bar a bit--hump the bump--no way.  haha Now for the only REAL downside, the elephant in the room-- location.  Seedy, scary, haha, but really the worse part is the famous 'sewer' smell of certain locations in Vegas.  Why the town can't figure out how to 'fix' this I have no idea.  But the location is in that old 'square shaped' shopping center between Sahara and Karen (Paradise and Maryland Pky) you'll find:  Lotus of Siam (good Thai) and Komul Thai (have not tried yet) along with some real creepy looking places.  Don't let that scare you away. Atomsphere:nice, cozy.  Service: very attentive, we sat at the bar. Food: fantastic.  Prices: $38 for 2 inc. 1 beer.  Nice local place that won't disappoint. Food was so good, I forgot to take pics."}
{"text":"We love Cornish and have been many times. I have never gone wrong with anything on the menu. Im always left full and satisfied with a pasty. They have a great atmosphere and large beer and drink selection. Staff has always been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, 3 levels with their own bar. They offer a variety of delicious party's to choose from as well as a great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Our go to spot when we want to go grab a bit to eat! Always great service, awesome food, and good drink menu. Prices are very reasonable as well! Whenever we have someone in town visiting, we will take them here because there is something for everyone and it never dissapoints. My favorites are the pilgrim and lovely a bit of salmon!"}
{"text":"So so awesome. When I have a hankering for back home food and I come across a gem like this place, I am in rapture! Cornish pasties, mushy peas, chips and curry sauce, all washed down with Boddingtons.........perfect"}
{"text":"Simply brilliant.  I didn't think I frequent this place that much, but the waitresses know my drink and order, which is outstanding customer service.  The food and atmosphere is what I expect of a eating establishment.  Can't wait for the new place."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for a pint on tap & a tasty pasty! I love the chicken pot pie, anything with lamb or pork too. It's comfort food to the max & they always get it right. Don't want to dine in? Get it partially baked & do the rest at home! Highly recommend this spot & the music is always great. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall in Tempe.  There isnt much room to sit and it isn't fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go.  A pasty is basically a calzone(only better) with a variety of different types of fillers.  I had the bangers and mash.  The wife had the Italian.  Everything was great served promptly and with a smile.  It's not Scottsdale fancy and that's what I like about it.  Best part is you can get a hearty meal with a soda for under $10.  If you want beer expect to pay a bit more."}
{"text":"I made a mistake. I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty. It was phenomenal! They have such a large menu of choices that I would have liked to try a bunch-but I can't image any others tasting better! YUM! It seems to be all ages (restaurant, non-smoking). Their is a beer and wine bar in the middle. Great place I will be coming here often! Most Pasties average $9.00 each, and they are filling! Wine is $6.50 a glass and Draft Beers are about $5.00 and up depending on brand and size."}
{"text":"A must try in Vegas for a most memorable meal. Great atmosphere, great food and excellent service. Their new downtown location is absolutely gorgeous! Cocktails, Pasty's , and great British desserts! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! They did mess up on our order but immediately fixed it and also did not charge us for the dish. Great beer selection too. Loved it."}
{"text":"A British pub that serves Patsy's.  Patsy's are basically super-awesome hot pockets.  This pub is pretty cool.  It's spacious & clean.  There's plenty of bench seating.  Food & drinks are cheap.  There's lots of great beers on tap too.  The Oggi - $9 - above average - 4/5 A Patsy w/ beef, onions, cheese, and potatoes.  It's pretty good and does the job.  I enjoyed it.  Chips - decent 3.5/5 The chips are pretty good.  They come out super crunchy (almost like a pretzel).  They're not like American chips which I'm used to.  Served w/ jalapenos & garlic.  TIPS: -Located in downtown.  Parking sucks. -$4 Irish Car bombs! :D"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you-  this pub bakery is the place to go to curve any craving! Each of their pastry is filled with delicious ingredients from cinnamon apples to BBQ chicken.   We had heard so many great things about this bakery and we now know why. The servings are huge and the prices and great! A great deal for your buck!   We can't wait to go back and try more of the huge selection they have going on!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy this place. I order the chicken tikka masala every time as it's great! I would recommend this place to anyone! My husband orders the cottage pie pasty and he really enjoys it. This place is a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Going here now is more of reminder that this restaurant is doing all of the right things... I used to go in and it was about 10 feet wide and about 60 feet long. Now it wraps around and its long overdue. I wish that their business was in a better center since the center that currently reside in is pretty abysmal. The food is great and that is all that matter though right?? 4 Stars definitely"}
{"text":"Once again, I visited Cornish Pasty while in Vegas, but this time I brought friends with me. We had gone hiking in Red Rock Canyon on a surprisingly cold, windy, and rainy day so a warm, filling pasty was the perfect food to chase away the hunger and chills.  Again, my husband and I shared the vegetarian rosemary chicken pasty because it's just that damn good. And then we also ordered one of the day's vegan options, a peppered steak pasty. Both were delicious, but I was a little confused as the where the vegan \"steak\" was in the one pasty. After hunting around for it and then asking our friendly server, it appears that NO vegan pasties contain mock meat as this establishment only using Quorn brand products which contain egg, making them vegetarian-friendly but not appropriate for vegans. Good to know but it was a bit perplexing that they don't come right out and state that. Nonetheless, the vegan pasties are still awesome and creative. However, I do hope that Cornish Pasty will consider using one the of many brands of vegan mock meats in addition to (or even instead of) Quorn so that vegans have heartier options. Beyond Meat and Gardein both have delicious vegan mock meats so I'd think it would be a very simple amendment to their very veg-friendly menu.   Oh yes, and hooray for happy hour ($1 off draft beers)! I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala pasty is great. The ambience and every thing is excellent. You can also try chicken pot pie here"}
{"text":"Superb Cornish cuisine.  A very wide range of both pasties and beer.  The wonderful desserts are a hidden treasure on the menu.  Great service and ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Just got to Tempe and this was the spot I chose for dinner. I was tired so I called in for take-out. I ordered the lamb vindaloo pasty, a cup of leek and potato soup, and the Shirley Temple pudding. The person taking my order said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so 21 minutes later I was parking my car and heading in to pick up my food.   Getting into the restaurant was a little confusing. I chose the door that had the restaurant name on it, but once I entered, it appeared that I came through a back entrance behind the bar area. I made my way around to what I'd consider the front of the restaurant and was guided to the pick up area. The guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out. I had a seat while they got it together.  I'd say my pasty was very rich, spicy and flavorful.  I'm used to pepper so I'm guessing it may be too spicy for some. The pasty was full of meat and I didn't feel slighted in the least. The soup was great, would order it again, however, they put it in a styrofoam drinking cup covered with foil, not very travel friendly."}
{"text":"You know when you have those days where you think \"diet? what diet?\" Yeah, those are the days that I go to the Cornish Pasty Company. Because what is a pasty if not a bread pocket stuffed with all the world's delights and 1,000 calories? Well, maybe not 1,000 calories, but it's close- it's also worth it!   Prior to abandoning meat, my favorite was the royale with cheese (minus the shrooms please). My favorite food in the entire world used to be a round patty of ground beef, sandwiched between two sesame seed buns until I discovered this little treasure. A pocket stuffed with ground beef, cheese,  grilled onions (and get this) french fries!! It honestly doesn't get any better than this. That is of course, until I became a vegetarian.  Now my favorite guilty pleasure has become the cheese and onion pasty. Packed with potatoes, rutabega, cheese and onions, and lots of ketchup on the size. Even though I know all the sodium will cause me to bloat up like a blimp later, I just can't resist eating it all in one sitting. There's a robust vegetarian menu, featuring Quorn brand mock-meat which has been delicious each time I've tried it.   And every now and then, when you're determined to stay on the old diet wagon, but everyone in your lunch meeting wants pasties, fear not, they do have a salad menu! The pasta salad is super yummy, and comes with the option of adding meat if you're looking for some additional protein.  Bottom line, there really is something for everyone at the Cornish Pasty Co. If you haven't tried it yet, do it!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after hearing alot of amazing things about it! And it didn`t disappoint!! There are so many pasties to choose from, I`m gonna have to keep coming back! And they do feature other British pub food, bangers and mash, shepard`s pie, etc. Noticed their burger is called Royale w/ cheese( Pulp Fiction anyone?). But back to the pasties!          After much deliberation and asking for recommendations, I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. (I mentioned I have a love of Indian food). And it was delicious!! Flavorful, served w/ a side of yogurt dressing, I was very satisfied!  These are pretty generous in size too and they also feature vegetarian pasties as well but I`m a meat girl!  Great atmosphere and great people! Looking forward to my next stop here!"}
{"text":"The Iron Maiden BEEEEERRR for $6.66!  Oh ya the foods good too, na everything at this place is great."}
{"text":"Pasties are good, yes? The service at this location blows. Who wants to drive all the way to Mesa, though?"}
{"text":"When we arrived it was a little confusing if the place was open or not.  The windows were covered with black shades so we couldn't see in but the sign was lit.  We ended up just picking what kind of appeared to be an entry.  We found out later that we went in through the side which used to be the main entrance, but was too small.  Within a few steps we noticed a very bad smell, but it went away after we kept walking.  We found out later that the smell is from a special kind of cave cheese they keep back there.  The smell was gross and made me think \"turn around and leave,\" but just then we were greeted by a friendly waitress who told us to sit where ever we wanted.  I was surprised at how dark it was in there.  I started with the potato cheese soup.  It was wonderful, but the fresh baked bread really added a nice compliment to it.  I had the shepherd's pie pasty with red wine sauce.  It was super delicious!  The crust was perfectly flaky, the lamb was tender and tasty, and that sauce was so flavorful!    I almost didn't order a desert for two reasons: #1 my husband isn't much of a desert person (and by this time I was so full I didn't think I could finish one by myself.)  And # 2 I was slightly concerned about my waistline.  I went ahead and did it anyway because I wasn't sure when I would get to go back.  I AM SO GLAD I ORDERED the toffee pudding!  It comes fresh baked so it takes a little while...wait dang it, you will not regret it.    It was not the kind of pudding I expected at all.  It appeared to be a little chocolate cake in a cast iron mini cauldron and to its side was a nice pour of creme anglaise.  I first tried just the cake and it was yummy, but then I began to slowly drizzle the creme over the cake watching it soak into it like a sponge.  The next bite was unbelievable!  It was so warm and soft and moist and sweet I thought I'd explode!  Overall, the whole experience was an A.  The wait staff was casual, but nice, patient, and informative and the food was very good.  I look forward to my next venture at this place!"}
{"text":"Meatballs with bacon, Devine. The onion sits so swell the grill gives it a house feel and a beauty for an appetizer.    A server saw us without a plate for cutting and brought my table extra, exceptional show of service.   \"The Italian\" has excessive amounts of oil, not sure if it were the cheese or meats, Pepperoni was not cooked well, home bread was left in the oven too long. But I must say the dish was very delightful, I am a fan of marinara and the side for dipping was just the right touch. Would I recommend, yes.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The absolute best!!! Hands down my wife and I love this place and live near by! Such amazing food! My wife is English, a Scouser from Liverpool and we love to come here and get a Ploughman's Plate, a couple of brews and to play pool on some of the best, most well kept tables! Hats off to RJ and Mike, our favorite, amazing bartenders. A must try!"}
{"text":"As a British person living in LV for almost 10 yrs now, I often get asked, \"do you miss home\" my response has typically been \"I miss the food\" This is where Cornish Pasty Co comes in. I've travelled the world several times and this place does a pasty right. Like many of the reviews say, don't be put off by the location. I'd drive to a war zone for the food here. Our server was friendly and helpful, the craft beer selection is awesome and my wife discovered a new favourite cider with the Aspall, I highly recommend the Oven Chips with garlic, I had the Lamb and Mint pasty which was perfect and then the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was out of this world. It's hard to pick a meal highlight because everything was great. Thank you Cornish Pasty Co. For bringing a taste of home for me to LV. I'll be back. Regularly!!"}
{"text":"I wish we could have tried this place but we could not bear the wait. We arrived around 7 PM on a Friday evening and the entryway was packed with other people waiting to be seated. The hostess stated that she couldn't give an estimate on how long for a party of 4 because a lot of people just \"hang out\". We waited for about 10 minutes but it was so hot and stuffy inside it felt worse that being outside in the 110 degree heat. Maybe we will give it another try in the cooler season."}
{"text":"I didn't realize I'd forgotten to write this review, so to start off 2018 here's my review of Cornish Pasty.  I met a friend down here for dinner. I had trouble locating the place and ended up parking 3 blocks away. Its basically ON Charleston.   Walking in, its a large space with a warehouse loft type of decor. Big bar in the center, tables and chairs all around, pool and darts areas. Nice place to hang out. Non-smoking.   Friendly service, bartender was super nice and super cute. The food is delicious. I had the \"Lovely bit of salmon\" pasty, my friend the Guinness Stew. I ordered a half baked \"Oggie\" to take to my sister. The salmon pasty was just ok, but the Guinness Stew was delicious!. I shared the Oggie with my sister and it was very good as well, but that Guinness Stew was really amazing.   Nice bar with plenty of microbrew selections and of course, hard liquor and wine. They were hosting a party on the other side of the bar so it did get a little bit loud in there after awhile. Well worth coming back to."}
{"text":"imagine hot pockets on steroids the good ones that B Bonds took"}
{"text":"Sorry Cornish!  You have a good thing going it seems but need some polishing/cleaning.  The place was doing a really brisk carryout business while we were there.  Very friendly and eclectic staff.  Good beer selection too.  The pasties were tasty but the temperature of the filling when reheated was not consistent - some hot spots, some cool spots.  I worry that this could be a recipe for food illness.  The star killer came just as we were getting ready to leave.  A small roach came crawling out onto the bar in front of us.  GGGAAAAHHHHDDDD."}
{"text":"I liked this location so much better than the Dobson one! Maybe it is the atmosphere, but to me the pasty even tasted better. I wish I lived closer to this location. Had the Greek pasty, and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"okay, so obviously this place is popular (it has over 1,000 reviews!).  and I generally like it.  but I am advising you NOT to order the bangers & mash pasty.  it was suuuuuper salty.  that is all."}
{"text":"Love Cornish Pasty. First time at this location.   Our well mustachioed server was very quick with drinks and very attentive to our questions.   We had the mushroom walnut soup to start. Piping hot and very flavorful. I liked the crunch from the walnuts and the bread was really fresh.    Lovely Bit of Salmon and the Reuben. Both very good. And still our favorites. Our server also brought out dessert very fast, as requested. Very great meal.   Non-smoking patio was a plus. There was a lot of out door heaters ready for colder nights too."}
{"text":"Love at first sight. Lust at first bite. And now I'm drunk with a red curry pasty infatuation. I don't know how it could have taken me so long to eat here, I've been eyeing this place since I moved here 3 years ago. This is my jam. This is what I look for in an eatery. This is where I want to hide out, drink beers and chat with my tatoo artist about the next ink-scursion.  Small, narrow, dark, perfect level of noise, good music, cool waitstaff, fun kitchen peeps, inexpensive, and friggin delicious. At 9:30 pm there was a line of about 10 people waiting for tables. Yep the food is that good and the joint is that cool.  New mission: try every veggie pasty on the menu and all sweet pasties."}
{"text":"Always seem to go here when I'm in Vegas. Never let me down so far. Always get a draft with shepherd pie or the office. Must try!!"}
{"text":"\"Eating out doesn't have to be a formula. Eating out is about having fun. I get really frustrated when it's badly done.\" ? Gordon Ramsay  Wow, what a location! We managed to snag a sweet spot in the upstairs loft by the windows that look out into Downtown Phoenix. Eleven of us squeezed ourselves into two church pews and a table. We had Oven Chips (one garlic and one jalapeño, the garlic fries were better), a Cobb Salad, and ten different kinds of pasties. Scooby Doo shots were had (Thanks, Simona!), cocktails were stiff, waters were filled, and food was demolished.  Cornish Pasty throughout the valley is pretty consistent but this location might edge out the rest from the views alone.  It's super dark inside as per usual and many of us blind bats had to rely on our phones to light up our menus but hey, it's all good.  Some of my favorites are the Shepherd's Pie, The Pilgrim, and Roast Dinner.  The Italian is also a great alternative to a calzone if you're in the mood for a cheese bomb.  Whatever you choose, I'm sure it will be an amazing bite.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So many great pasties to choose from and I definitely will be back to try more. Perfect comfort food. Nice cocktail menu. The place is pretty huge inside and has a nice open layout. I don't love the location... parking downtown can be a pain and not my favorite area to have to walk, especially if I'm alone. But other than the location, this place is worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"I came here to  this Tempe location only once, about 2 months ago with a ethnic dining MeetUp.  If anyone ventures to order the lamb and mint cornish pasty, please let me know if you find any meat in it!  Cos I couldn't find any in mine, just layers and layers of potatoes.  When I later told another ethnic dining buddy that I wasn't going back to Cornish Pasty, he (not eating with me, but went another time) said he ordered same and could not find the lamb in it, either.  He even told the manager, who said the \"cook musta made a mistake and forgot the lamb\".  See if they \"make a mistake\" on yours, too.  If you order another lamb pasty, LMK if you find the lamb in that one, too.  Eating these pasties is like \"mining\".  You don't see what you are getting till you get there with your mouth and fork, cos it visually hidden inside the pastry shell, so you keep digging and digging for the lamb.  Cost me $12 + for a \"potato pasty\" incl tax and tip.  BaaaahhhhhhD."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch and was totally impressed. From the staff to the food it was easily one of the best experiences we have had since moving to AZ. I would highly recommend trying this pub out. Great food!"}
{"text":"I lived in a mining community in Northern Ontario Canada, and families traditionally made pastys for the mining men. They would take these meals underground in a metal lunch bucket and place them on the machinery to warm them up.  I still have a metal lunch bucket, but have missed making the pastys. Well, the Cornish Pasty Co have captured the spices excellently in the Oggie. Adding many IPAs to the choice of beverages makes this a great social place in the Commercial Center!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find.  Thanks to the folks at Hop Nuts, we wandered over to Cornish Pasty.   We were craving a little something for a late dinner and we were so happy to find this place.    We came in, sat down, had a drink, ordered food and enjoyed it all.   The place is super chill and relaxing.   The pasties we had were really good and just the right amount for a late evening dinner,  I wasn't stuffed, but I was full.   If I was hungrier, I would have had the fries, but all in all this was a winner.     Good show folks.  Will I be back?  Yup... great find downtown."}
{"text":"Lort!!!!! Cornish is SO good! I typically try something new every time I go but there's always something amazing on the menu cause there's SO MANY DIFFERENT ONES."}
{"text":"I ordered four different pasties through Postmates. They were all good, and the  Shepherds Pie stood out as fantastic. I will try others, likely this weekend :-) L"}
{"text":"So, the first thing I have to say is that the food here is amazing. If you care about nothing else except the taste of your food--go here.  If you care about things like: customer service and appropriate wait times (at the University location, not the other one), I would suggest not vising this restaurant.  I've had many experiences with Cornish Pasty. My friends love it, and when it comes to the food, I love it too. (Especially the pork pasty.)  I've only had one good one though--and that was when I sat directly at the bar and told the woman standing there what I wanted.   The a few of the other times happened something like this:  1. Went in alone, waited fifteen minutes for anyone to come over and even wipe down my table, let alone ask for a drink or dinner order.  2. Went there with 4 other friends, waited 2 hours for a table, and the gentleman acting the 'host' was especially rude when we would ask him about how long he thought it would be (roughly ever 30 minutes) and he always said \"Looks like 15 more minutes.\" Then when we were finally seated our drinks came back half empty and my pasty was cold in the center.  The truth is, is that while the food is great the company needs to retrain it's workers. Customer service should be at the top of their list, and from what I can tell it's at the bottom."}
{"text":"mmmm Pastries, and not the bland British kind.  I like the selection, the taste, and the price point!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's not someplace I go to often but I'm never dissatisfied. I love the fact I can get the pasties Togo and make at home. They have a chill vibe and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Being an English chap, I'd like to think I know what a good pasty is all about. I even make my own for our friends here. But this is the best I've ever had, I mean that and I've spent lots of time in Cornwall.  I had the traditional pasty as the benchmark and it was fantastic. The filling was spot on, as was the pastry. The menu was very diverse, with things that should never be in a bit of pastry - Hamburger & fries for example but other things that will be lovely to try the next time I'm there.  As for the atmosphere, I really liked it. There were four of us, with two little saucepan lids. Good music playing, skater feel, bench seats, all in all a good vibe. Please don't think of this is as an English themed place, if only we had things like this there. Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great hearty foods. Interesting touch with the church pews. Neopolitan milk stout was delicious."}
{"text":"HMOG!  I'm in love!  I had the bangers n mash pasty today - my first time to this establishment.  It brought me back to Sunday \"dinners\" when I was a kid in New England.  AMAZING flavor, and my grandmother would have been happy with the pastry.  For dessert, I tasted my friend's PB, banana & Raspberry J pasty.  REALLY?  hahahaha - my tongue is still laughing with delight!  RIDICULOUSLY tasty pasty! I WILL be back.  Please don't deny yourself!!!!   Oh...wait - atmosphere...not what I expected.  Dark, loud music, but my friend and I were very comfortable holding a conversation above the sounds.  My eyes adjusted to the light! (ha) Waiter was very personable, and the service was good.  If you're in a rush, get take out.  If you have some time to comfortably kill, eat in.  Whatever your time allotment to spend, don't forego this restaurant.  (sigh)"}
{"text":"My all time facotite place! Tons of delicious pasties including vegetarian and vegan options. Nice deserts and great sides. I've been taking here family, friends, co-workers...everybody loved it so far! Between dozens of options and flavors anyone can find his favorite!"}
{"text":"Tried their Chicken Greek. It was tasty. But, it didn't wow me. Why didn't it wow me? Is my wow-o-meter broken? Shouldn't the pasty wow me? I mean, this place has got some serious fans. And I totally dig this place. But, again, I wasn't wowed by the pasty. And I really think I should have been.   I need to go during happy hour, when I can pair my pasty with a Rogue Hazelnut Brown."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers & the pasties are delicious. So many options. Clean place. Fast friendly service. They'll even make em to go. It's like an oversized empanada, packed with meat and seasoned nicely."}
{"text":"Love Cornish! Tasty food (you can't go wrong with meats, veggies, cheese, and bread), great atmosphere, nice staff, and $3 Irish car bombs. All. The. Time.   There's a ton of tables here, ranging from intimate booths to huge pub style tables (make some new friends!). A huge list of beers on tap, decently priced. They have a patsy for all, vegan even! I love the Italian. Royale with Cheese is also a good fall back. Hell, even their mashed potatoes are bomb.   Makes for a fun night out. I love going there to pregame, as I mentioned, $3 car bombs. You not only get a good buzz, but also get to eat! Happy hour all day Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place has the authentic flavor of a Cornish Pasty! They have a nice variety and their lemonade a are fresh squeezed and it taste like heaven OMG!   Totally recommended!   Check out their new location on Charleston and Main. Totally worth it. A new place to hit in downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food and drinks. Everything was excellent in that way. We got the chicken pot pie pasty. It was excellent with its own unique flavor. Be prepared for a long wait on the food because everything they make is fresh (it took 35 minutes for our Food to arrive). So if you are starving go somewhere else. I also didn't like how bright it was, and the music selection wasn't on point. I get it it's a hipster bar... just could have been better on that. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the vibe. Will be back for food."}
{"text":"Loved that place (great pastys) until I found a hair - hopefully not of pubic origin - on my last visit (in February 2013)...."}
{"text":"Mikey is so awesome! Helped me out, gave me great service with great recommendations! He kills it for my first time!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place. Located in an industrial area. You wouldn't think much of it. It's a pub so what would you expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The English pot pies are a must. We ordered two varieties . The first was like a lamb stew and the second reminded me of thanksgiving dinner. All very good."}
{"text":"Omg the words hole in the wall comes to mind when you pull into this kinda oldish run down small business park but like the saying goes the best food comes from hole in the walls well this place has a doctor who time capsule that quickly zaps into the UK grabs Cornish pasties and zaps back to Las Vegas and gives you omg gives you a Cornish pasty straight from the homeland only wish is I was staying one more day as Id definitely come back tonight."}
{"text":"love this place. the atmosphere is fun, the place is packed every time I go with my vegetarian friend. so many choices, I want to try them all! service is fast, likely because it's do popular that they want to move people thru once you finish eating. and to be polite, once done, it's friendly to give your table to the next famished folks. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and and good presentation. I had the chicken tikka masala which was perfectly made.  Inexpensive but amazing flavors that will burst in your mouth , make sure you eat here before you kick the bucket"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Came with a group of friends for a nice dinner and the food was just okay, first of all, the item I wanted, they ran out of. So I picked another and again, they were out of it. A friend of mine as well as I, had to order something we were settling on. The cocktail menu selection was very limited, so again, it was choose from this menu of three things or get a glass of wine. I guess I just expected a wider menu for signature cocktails given it's such a niche restaurant.  On top of that, we had a table that was pretty much no lighting except for the two tea light candles. I couldn't even see what I was eating, so that was a bit of a turn off from coming back.   The food was okay, the music was too loud to have a normal conversation, and there was almost no light to even see what was in my food. Probably won't be back here unless someone convinces me otherwise."}
{"text":"About time I left a review for this place. Their pastys are amazing and the service is always on point. Came here with some friends and my camera, and wanted to share a photo I took of the wonderful, dimly lit interior. The lighting sets the tone for an intimate, relaxed hang with your friends.   The beer selection is always kept interesting with their 5 rotating taps, one being local. The standards on tap are always good, but their cocktails are worth the deviation.   I now live out of state, but every time I come home, Cornish off Hardy is on my top spots to hit while in town. Thanks for the good times, good brews, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Top notch. Extensive menu for food and beers, the staff are friendly and the location is good. Pasties are plentiful, both traditional and more exotic. Real vinegar is offered and a must for the fine fries that we shared as a side.  \"Dogs bollocks\"   The highest compliment from my home town of Birmingham, West Midlands.  I will be back...often."}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  This place rocks. Commercial center just got a little pasty better. I have lived here 22 years and am a long time customer of the plaza. I'm so glad they chose this place. The food is fresh the atmosphere is fun. They are now part of the awesome family of businesses at commercial center since 1963. You have to try this place it's what lotus of Siam is to Thai cornish pasty co. Is to pasty."}
{"text":"When I first went hunting for this place, I wasn't sure it was open. Don't be deterred, open the door and be welcomed by a warm, low-key ambiance. Good food and no pressure from the staff. Reminds me of my families' favorite go-to restaurant overseas."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Every time I visit the Pasty, I fall in love with the place all over again. I always get the cream of leek soup and I am never disappointed. I also recommend the chicken pot pie, the chicken Alfredo pasty and the portobella pasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never had a bad pasty. They are so hearty and delicious with a great beer and cider selection. Atmosphere is fun and easy going, definitely a place you want to hang out for a while."}
{"text":"Went over the July 4th holiday and could not have been more disappointed.  Ordered the Royale with Cheese and my girlfriend got a veggie order. From the time we sat down until we got our order was almost an hour! It was a good thing we were staying across the street at San Carlos, or I would've been really annoyed if I had to have drive any distance to get home. The waitress (skinny brunette with glasses) decided it was more important to pay attention to a group of women that came in that bought a bunch of booze than us. When we finally received our food, it was good, but not worth the wait. If you feel like being ignored because you don't wanna by booze with your dinner, this place is for you! Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant, great tasting food.  There are so many pasties to choose from that it is  likely to please anyone.  As a local, I always bring visiting guests here for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. We loved this place for so many reasons. Of course the Pasties.....one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. I got the PILGRIM!!! WAS like Thanksgiving dinner in a warm wonderful yummy pastry served with gravy and cranberry sauce. My husband got the ROYAL....AWESOME!!! My mother in law got the Lamb and mint, and my sister in law got the original. All of them were amazing!!! The atmosphere was interesting and unique....tables in between church pews!!! The service was great!! The owner Richard rocks!!! VERY CUTE!!! He even came to our table to make sure we were happy with everything. I would and will go back in a heart beat!!! Deffinantly will bring all my friends and family here. You really have to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Have to say, I enjoyed my meal here. Was on that side of town opened my bookmarks and was glad to find the Cornish Pasty Co. Was only 2 miles from the casino we were at.   Going in I guessed the Pasty was a gourmet Hotpocket and I wasn't too far off. The breading was incredible. The ingredients were plentiful and the serving size was enormous.   I didn't care for the dipping sauce my Cajun Chicken pasty came with but the spice on the chicken was wonderful. The Fiancee had the Ruben and thought it was very good.   The jalapeno and garlic fries were fresh cut fries (not normally my favorite cut of fries) and they were OMG good. Some of the best fries I've ever had.   The beer list was impressive but they didn't have the first two beers I asked for so I finally gave up and just picked randomly from the visible taps. Three sizes average pricing and very cold.  It was very warm inside, guess they haven't turned on my the AC yet. The  waitstaff was very engaging said the AC would be on come June when it was actually warm outside. No hard alcohol so you better drink beer or wine.  We had a good time and will keep it in mind the next time we are down there."}
{"text":"i still love the food, the place is just super small its hard to move around and go with a party of more than 4 people. If you wanna try it out and have a large group go to the Mesa location."}
{"text":"Woohoo! I've nothing negative to say about this place. Their food, booze and service are always on point. I've tried several of their pasties, so far none to complain about. My goal is to ultimately try them all. See you in 300 lbs!  My husband always gets the same one, The Oggie. And I always wind up wanting a couple fat bites of his. It really is a classic. In the meantime, I'll continue my quest of polishing off their entire menu. Wish me luck."}
{"text":"I love this place, food is great and beer selection in awesome.  My favorite pasty is the vegetarian greek, so good!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place. There were so many selections of 'pie' and the ambience was great. Our server was top of her game and food was really really good. I ordered the cottage pie and the tandoori wings. I loved the wings and the pie esp the gravy. The portions were just right and the prices were not that expensive either. Such good food and great experience. Will for sure go back again."}
{"text":"Lamb Vindaloo Cornish Pastie. Do it! Amazing! As a genuine Glaswegian I can tell you this place is great. It looks like a total shady dive bar when you walk in. It's unkempt and the staff look like they can (and want to) kick your arse but don't be a wee young lassie and get in there. Food was great, I wish I had been able to try more, like the HP sauce wings, but the Lamb Vindaloo won. Servers were really cool and the crowd was an interesting, good people watching, mix. If I am in Phoenix again I will be here again. Done!"}
{"text":"One of my longtime friends is British so I try to find places that will remind him of home so I was excited to try this place. I went with my family and a friend who spoke highly of the restaurant. It was a Saturday around 11:30am and we were able to greeted & seated immediately.   The food took an average amount of time cooking and came to our table hot out of the kitchen.  The quality, taste and presentation was what I expected based on the pictures from the website.   Splendid.   We had the $4 car bombs (woohoo), the egg appetizer, the Full English Pasty, Bangers & Mash Pasty, & Veggie Pasty.  I would have loved to try the desserts but was full on 1/2 of my Pasty.  The prices are good for the amount of food you get.   The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was relaxed.  I've never been to England so I don't know how it compares to tradition, but if it's as good as these than I'm sure I'd love them.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"I can't. Please contact me back so I can edit this. This is my second half baked that tasts like freezer burn. You're food is going down hill."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  Gourmet calzones....mmmm delicious!  Tried the pot pie and the Greek chicken and neither one dissappointed at all!!  Service was quick and friendly.  It is a small and cozy restaurant/bar.  Everything is between $9-$11.  Family friendly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow! I fell in love with this place as soon as I saw the beer menu. So many great beers on tap, poured in 32 ounce frosty steins.   The menu has so many choices that it is hard to decide what to get. I ordered The Pilgrim. My incorrect assumption was that the pasties would be heavy, doughy concoctions. In fact, the pastry itself is very light and flaky. The filling consisted of turkey, stuffing, and sweet potato. Imagine the best day-after-Thanksgiving sandwich you have ever tasted and you would have The Pilgrim. It came with a side of whole cranberry sauce and light gravy to smother all over the yumminess. Most importantly, it was obvious that the ingredients were fresh. No canned potatoes and gravy here.   The ONLY reason I do not rate this establishment with \"5-stars\" is because I want to try more items on the menu but if the rest of the food tastes like what I consumed today, I will raise it up."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place to eat.  In town for the NCBA Expo and ended up eating here twice with members of the team.  Three different levels in the place to choose to eat.  Ate once upstairs and then on the street level the second night.  Tons of choices and the pastry was light and filling at the same time. Very filling! Highly recommend oven chips with cheese and jalepenos!  Service was better second night but outstanding place!"}
{"text":"The set up is weird. The bar when you first walk in is too hot to sit there. The guys also didn't care if you did, they basically ignored you. Go around into the other dining room where it's a good crowd, sat at the bar. Bartender was sweet and friendly. We ordered side of garlic mashed potatoes, way too salty. My partner ordered the burger pasty, wasn't bad but wasn't great. I ordered the stew, just not what I expected. That too was salty, the pasty itself was good and flaky. I won't be returning, not worth it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed the fine food and ambience at Cornish Pasty Company. We've been visiting for a few years now and love the availability of cold beers, and unique pasty offerings. I love the Thanksgiving Pasty - turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes all rolled up in a luscious dough pocket. Their Little Bit of Salmon pasty is also very nice. We go in for the garlic fries and mushy peas as well - can't leave without my mushy peas!! This is a great spot for a snack if you want to share or a meal if you want your own pasty all to yourself. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal, hands down! Love the atmosphere, from the pool tables upstairs to the old Italian booth seating in the dungeon. There are bars located on all 3 floors, super convenient and should make things go smoothly. It definitely has an edgy vibe, with interior and most guests doting black, slight goth meets new English pub. The pilgrim is a must try on the menu, also the chicken pot pie will make you feel like your home. I give four stars simply because of the service. While I attended the soft opening and after several times, I was highly disappointed in the service. Granted, I've taken into account soft openings and openings in general, but it seemed as though most of these servers/bartenders didn't have a clue as to how you  actually serve patrons. From having staff just stare at me when I come in without speaking, to being completely forgotten about at a table and having to ask for someone else to bring drinks, silverware and eventually food, amongst other things that aren't necessary to explain. It's a great place, decor, food, liveliness, but the staff sure needs some training in plain old customer service. Will I go back? Yes, because the food is that brilliant."}
{"text":"We Ordered the Cornish and the original they are huge! We it up swapping halves, so we each got to taste each others Pasty.  Love love love this place.  Pasty's were awesome. Waitresses are sweat.  Ambiance is worth the effort of finding parking."}
{"text":"The food here is so freaking good.  Totally a hipster place, but once you eat a Pasty, you will come back no matter what!  Just recently expanded too!"}
{"text":"I had my first pasty here and it was good. One of the interesting things about this place is that they serve vegan pasties which have the flavor of chicken tikka masala. It's called veggie chicken tikka masala. That's my favorite. I have tried the veggie oggie and cheese &a onion pasties. They are good as well. The oven chips they serve are really good."}
{"text":"I love the food and have come here often, however I'm kind of sick of being burned. If you don't have salmon filets available for the evening, it would be nice to let your patron know instead of serving chopped up fish. It's a different experience and I would've just omitted it from my order and ordered another drink or mashed potatoes. But I don't waste food and won't send it back so here we are.   Please 86 something when you're out. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant the food is so good the atmosphere is really nice it's hip and trendy.  It's sort of a goth meets bohemian atmosphere...  I have never once been able to finish my entire meal and I can eat with the best of them.  The only problem is the staff is awful they are not friendly, they are not nice and they take forever.  They go out of their way to make you feel like you're bothering them.  I don't really care about the service and I only go there in the evenings or on the weekends because they are so slow you can't get in and out for lunch.  But I highly recommend the place ignore the staff and enjoy the food and the atmosphere!  Enjoy! Lousy staff or not I will continue to be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! We've been waiting for months for it to open (that sign being out front for so long has been the biggest tease!). It was totally worth the wait. We went in around dinnertime yesterday evening, and there were several super personable guys working.  We got a couple of draught beers (they've got some great craft selections, & a few are local) and chose the Oggie and the Royale with Cheese (tee hee!) pasties. The red wine gravy is SO good, and their ranch is also better than most ranches (it's gotta have buttermilk in it). The pasties themselves are enormous, at least for me, since I can't eat a ton in one sitting. I took half of mine (the Royale) home, while my dude scarfed his in its entirety.  The joint itself isn't big, but feels homey, and slightly hipster, which works for it in this case and isn't annoying or detracting. (Man, there was a lot of flannel being worn in there, too!) Kind of feels like a place you'd find in Portland. Oh, and if one of the guys behind the bar looks familiar, you've probably seen him checking IDs at Atomic. :)  Summary: Hip, casual, comfortable, friendly, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Hey as a brit culinary trained and it is just great to enjoy great british food... well done to both back and front pf house great service all round great beer and a great place to relax.......well done and i am so happy to have a new place to eat...."}
{"text":"How did I not go here earlier?! DELISH!!! We've been living here 3 years, driving by this location and wondering how the food was, even had friends tell us we needed to go here, and we only recently decided on a whim and kid-free date night to stop in. NO REGRETS. Best pasties! We've tried the chicken pot pie, Reuben, Cubano, bangers & mash... ALL GOOD! It's hard to pick a favorite. We've decided to eat our way through the menu and try something new each time. Won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The dough of these pasties is drool worthy. So yummy. Nice little spot, great variety and selection, vegetarian options galore!"}
{"text":"Pulling up to this place I did not get any 5 star vibes so I was kind of confused.  We walked in and the place was pretty dark. It was hard for my eyes to adjust from the light outside to the dimness of the restaurant. Decided to sit at the bar and were greeted with a friendly server. He helped us with out drink choices and was quick to put our orders in, which was great because we were really hungry.  Never had a pasty before and after having their's, I really don't know why! It was soooo good. Chunks of flavored beef accompanied by other ingredients and cheese all folded into a flaky pastry. So good! Talking about it is making me crave it even more. Too bad it's not closer to home, but I would make the drive for that pasty!  BTW, my boyfriend and I shared one pasty plate and added an extra side. The portion was more than enough for us both.  Stop by if you're in town and try for yourself! It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"By far, one of the best pasties I've ever had! car bombs are dirt cheap!  If you're craving for English pub food, come here! they do have other variations of pasties like Mexican fillings, but don't get that, stick with the typical English.  Stay away from the Curry fries, it's sooo salty for some reason!  The inside was designed very narrow which means seating is limited.  So you walk in and it's just a narrow path with 2-4 person tables and back area with bench seating to fill a dozen people."}
{"text":"Hutch was very welcoming and friendly one reason we will return. Thank you Hutch. The food is amazing and next time we will do dinner."}
{"text":"Was in town with a friend and googled  some late night spots and up came cornish pasty.  I was really looking for something chill, had character, good beer selection and something a little different then what im used to from back home. I definately wasnt disappointed. I ordered the cajun chicken and booooy was it bomb. Its a great size and fills you up without making you over the top full. There are so many pasty selections it was almost hard to chose.  Music was on point and so was the service. Only complaint is that you would expect your pasty to come out much quicker than it had, thinking they just bake it for you but Im just being picky.  Would 100% recommend checking out this hole in the wall spot, not to mention im pretty sure I had an arabian goddess as a server who made the experience that much more fun. Great staff. Its a very hipster spot which only made me feel more at home. Check out Cornish pasty! You wont be dissappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good but not a traditional English pasty as I've had them in England.  We tried the \"traditional\" and the Guiness.  Both were good.  Some of their creations strike me as odd though.... a cheeseburger pasty?"}
{"text":"The wait is *finally* over! Cornish Pasty has soft opened their downtown location. And I couldn't be more smitten.   Allen texted me during an especially gruelling day of work announcing this restaurant was opened and invited me to dinner. How could I resist?! When we arrived, the place was bustling and the main floor was packed. So we made our way upstairs to the huge dining area. We were promptly brought waters and menus, and asked about the best appetizers to order. We opted for the chicken liver pate and an order of Scotch egg. The pate was fantastic! The flavors popped and we agreed this was something we would eat with a spoon if no one was watching. I recommend getting the toasted bread with this. The Scotch egg was perfectly cooked and served with a side of honey mustard. It was good enough without the dipping sauce, but it added another layer to the experience.  Now, for what they're known for: the pasties. I ordered the lamb and mint, plus a side of mashed rutabaga because I've never had mashed rutabaga. (Truth be told,  I actually ordered the rutabaga because it was a code word in an episode of Charmed. Gosh, did I really admit that?!?). I love lamb, and this played perfectly into my love of this meat. While the mashed rutabaga was a tab salty, it still had great flavor and together with the pasty made for a filling meal. So much so that I ended up taking half home. I'm thinking lustfully of heating this up for lunch tomorrow.   Service was pleasant and the atmosphere was wonderful! Allen mentioned it would have been great if they had opened when his dad and step mom were in town, but we'll have a destination for them next year when they are back in town. For being their soft opening, everything appeared to go without a hitch, and I can't wait to get back and eat through the menu. I even think there is something my David will find familiar enough to eat."}
{"text":"It's always a wonderful experience here thanks to Shannon! She is so attentive, sweet, quick, and all around wonderful. She has great product knowledge and people skills! Such an asset to this place. Not to mention the food is wayyy too good! The beer selection is also awesome. One of my favorite places to go to. I also love that they cater so heavily to vegetarians AND meat lovers.   If you get to catch (jake?, the cook with the bandana on his head) cooking he's a character and super fun to talk to.   My personal favorites are the veggie cottage pie, mushroom pasty (I forgot name), and my boyfriend loves The Mexican.   If you're trying to keep it healthy the Greek salad with added veggie chicken or chicken is delicious (we like to add jalapeños to it as well for an extra kick)  ALSO the tomato soup/ cream of leek potato stilton are your taste buds' soul mates!!  Lastly, the chocolate bread pudding is SO SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of the place. Three floors: pool table in top floor with bar but seams to never have a bar tender, middle floor bar area and kitchen, downstairs super dark room nice for dates. Food was okay had the meatballs but they tasted like dirty dish rag. Also had their  version of an empanada  it was good. Nothing that made me go yummy. But good beer selection. Will go back for beer. Beer me !"}
{"text":"Wanted to post review to this place. Better late than never. Forgot exactly what I ordered. One item was peppered steak sandwich & other item was like juicy cheeseburger, sorry forgot names. Anyways, wanted to compliment customer service of my order-taker. Was a to-go order. Had to hurry back to my fiancé that just got out of appendicitis surgery (appendix removal). Really cool guy talking to me about his past experience of the same condition. Had a lot of fun playing shuffle board & throwing darts while my delicious food was being prepared. Lastly, other restaurant-goers were so friendly. Definitely going back to enjoy their atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I never knew what a pasty was until this place came around, but man am I glad I know what it is now. Every pasty that I've tried is beyond delicious! My favorite pasty is the Lovely Bit of Salmon, I can't get enough of it! There are a lot of vegetarian options here too, which I love. The real gem here is the Shirley Temple Pudding dessert. Words cannot describe how amazing it is. It's so good, I refuse to share!  I take my friends and family here and they all love the food here. Even my dad loves it and he's very picky! :)  The bartenders/servers are very nice. This is a seat yourself anywhere type of place, and I found it to be a perfect spot to eat great food and catch up with a friend. They never rush you out, which is always nice. The employees always make great suggestions and have yet to let me down."}
{"text":"Co-workers and I came opening day not knowing what to expect. We were their 3rd official customers and within the first few bites we knew it was our new favorite lunch spot in downtown Phoenix! Very cool tri-level space with an English pub feel. We sat in a church pew-like table on the main floor and the place was getting pretty packed around lunchtime.  We started off with an order of Scotch Eggs (my 1st time) and it was super tasty.. wish there were more than four slices but flavors did not disappoint.  As for our main orders.. I ordered the Roast Beef Sarnie (like an English take of a Philly) and it was so delicious!  Amazing crust, the best ingredients, and they were huge! The others ordered The Pilgrim x2 (Thanksgiving pasty) and the Oggie (the original pasty). They were all yummy, but I loved mine the most!  Loved the food so much, we recommended it to 2 other folks at work who each ordered the Reuben Pasty and they both had rave reviews.  One of the co-workers even went back the next day; that's how good it was!  And I plan on taking the husband this weekend so he can try, too!  Food was amazing.. service was outstanding & food did not take long to be prep'd during the lunch crowd.. Also, reasonable pricing as most Pasties were between $10-$12.. Portion is huge enough to share, but you probably won't want to share, lol! The only downside is there isn't a location near me in NW Peoria, but hopefully in the near future :)"}
{"text":"WOW! so glad you guys found this place.  I go to London  every year and when I'm there I don't pass these things up.  They are soo filling and DELICIOUS!!  The only bad thing about the restaurant was the lack of air conditioning and the kitchen is two feet away from the tables. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND HOT!  but overall TWO THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! So happy they have vegetarian options (& not just a handful, but many!). The peanut butter & jelly pasty is delicious; I would also recommend the vegetarian chicken tikka masala pasty.  ...and I almost forgot about the jalapeño garlic home fries!! Cut fresh (the way they should be), with skins on, absolutely fabulous"}
{"text":"Delicious!  When I first discovered this place, I came thrice in a week.  However, how good your experience is depends hugely on the pasty you order.  The original Oggie and the Vindaloo are truly fantastic; the Oggie tastes just like (better?) than the pasties I've had in England, and the Vindaloo is like my uncle's curry stuffed into delicious flaky crust.  A-mazing... and these will keep you full all day.  The service is great; even today during lunch, my friend and I never went more than fifteen minutes without being asked if we needed a refill or anything else, which was refreshing.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They finally opened. I had bookmarked this particular restaurant quite some time ago and when they never opened i deleted the bookmark and then added the bookmark back. I did this several times for over a year and finally they opened their doors for business.   I came here with a friend who's mom is from England and is always looking for good British food in town to lure her mom here for a visit, so it wasn't too hard to convince her to try this place with me this week.  We arrived around 530 and the place wasn't packed but there were already a number of diners seated. The restaurant is much larger than expected and I enjoyed the ambiance quite a bit. It's on the darker side and makes you feel like you're the only people in the place.   We were seated quickly and perused the menu. Their pasty selection is extensive so it took us quite a bit of time to decide what we wanted to order. In the interim, we settled on some cider that was offered during happy hour. Our waitress was nice but service was a bit slow during our entire meal. She was apologetic about it so we weren't too perturbed. I decided on the lamb vindaloo pasty, since I was in the mood for something spicy. Our meals were slow to arrive, but worth the wait. At first we weren't sure about the portion size. They are deceptively large, when we first thought they were on the smaller side. I enjoyed my pasty quite a bit and it had the spicy kick I had been hoping for. My friend enjoyed hers quite a bit as well. I have tried pasties a few times in the past but I have to say this was probably my favorite so far. We each were only able to finish half of our meal, but took the rest to go with us. I couldn't resist ordering dessert as well, I ended up with the Shirley Temple's Pudding since I absolutely adore sticky toffee pudding and my friend got the strawberry pavlova. Both were good, with my pudding edging hers out by a nose in the flavor department.   We had a fabulous meal and my fella even raved about how good my leftovers were, so we will likely be back soon to give them another go. Just be sure you aren't in too much of a rush when you dine here since our whole meal took over two hours from start to finish."}
{"text":"Been here three times and always had crummy service after hours. Waited way too long at an empty bar to try to get something."}
{"text":"Loved the food here - I had lamb and mint, my husband had chicken tikki masala, and both were absolutely excellent. The sauces that come on the side were delicious as well. Good portion sizes, enough for a hearty lunch to fill you up at a reasonable price.   They keep the restaurant dark so every window is covered by black drapes. No problem it's just the style they are going for, but it looked closed when we pulled up - so don't be afraid to open the door! Will certainly be coming back if we can."}
{"text":"This was the first Cornish Pasty Company location I visited.    5 stars for the food.  I fell in love with this food!  I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty and I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavor reminded me of a Mexican casserole of sorts.  It was delicious.  DD got a peanut butter and jelly pasty, which had bananas inside.  She was smitten.  SD got the Oggie and DH got the Cottage Pie.  Both loved their choices, which came with Red Wine Gravy for dipping sauce.  DM got the Carne Adovada and said she liked it but the pork was a little tough.  4 stars for the location.   The parking was a nightmare (it took DM and SD 15 minutes to find a space) and the restaurant really has an ASU clientele.  The place was dark, cold (we were near the exterior door which they left open because the kitchen was so hot) and small.  I do not think this is a good place to bring kids, at all.  I will definitely come back for a visit... though next time it will be sans 4 year old!"}
{"text":"A few of the pasties that I have had:  Carna Adovado   Royale   Bangers and Mash  Oven Chips   Dark in restaurant where everyone is using their phone flashlight to see the menu.  Could use some TV's to enhance the atmosphere or follow games  I love the Carna Adovado Pastie which has a great mexican food flavor. I would recommend asking for 2 of the salsa rather than one Salsa and one sour cream.  I am not a drinker so can not tell you about the beer and wine selection.   The food is highly recommended for a change in burgers and pizza.   Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam had too long of a wait so I wandered over here.  Great little hole in the wall dinner spot.  Meat pastries dominate the menu and they are actually quite filling at an average of $9 each.  Definitely a different food experience than anything else I've had in Vegas.  Decent beer selection as well.  I got The Pilgrim, which was like Thanksgiving in a pastry, delish.  Came with a side of their red wine gravy and cranberry sauce.    Only complaint was I ordered thier baked potato fries as an appetizer but they didn't even come out by the time I finished my Pilgrim.  Not sure if they had started a new batch for my order or what.  The waitress took it off my bill without a second thought though.  She was working by herself but still managed to deliver decent service.  Place is way off the strip (a plus in my book if you are driving) in a somewhat deserted shopping mall.  Worth a try if you are looking for a no hassle made-from-scratch dinner that's easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"The Parliament wings were not great--baked, but tastes like the sauce (simply coated in uneventful spicy honey) was added after the wings were cooked. The royale and chicken tikka masala pasties, however, were AH-amazing! The spices of curry chicken dripping of tikka masala sauce and bell peppers are cooled by the light minted yogurt for a flavor-packed, well-balanced finish. The rich flavor of cheddar-Swiss cheese blended so perfectly with onions, mushrooms and bacon almost tops the succulent flavor of the beef patty itself. No need for fries...both of these pasties come loaded with potatoes for a nice, full finish."}
{"text":"One of my classmates, a las vegas native, recently told me about this place, so when I had an unexpected gap in the middle of my day and was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd give it a try.   Big mistake, but 100% worth it! The food was so good, but talk about food coma. Luckily I had enough time to get a power nap in before going back to work!   I was not expecting this place to be a pub (I didn't read the yelp reviews, really) so I was pretty surprised when I walked in. I am also pretty sure I have never been in a pub at 11 am before, either, so that was a new experience. It is not at all smoky (or at least it wasn't when nobody else was there).   I arrived slightly before opening but the door was unlocked, so I went in. I was greeted promptly by a friendly man behind the counter, and had a seat for a few minutes while they finished opening up.   The menu is extremely extensive with two pages of pasties to choose from. I was a little surprised / disappointed to find they did not have a Cornish game hen pasty, which I don't think is even a thing, but I just thought it would be a fun thing to have ;) I ordered the bangers & mash pasty and got a partially-baked oggie (traditional) pasty to go. My hands still stank (and tasted like) surgical soap from work, so I went after my pasty with a fork and knife. Though the crust is flaky, it was still dense enough to be managed with utensils - it's not as flaky or delicate as a croissant. I personally liked the texture of the oggie pasty better - I liked the texture of the steak and potatoes more than the creamy/mushy texture of the bangers and mash (though the flavor of both was really good). A note: the pasty does not reheat well in the toaster oven, it was pretty soggy. It should definitely be reheated / finished in a traditional oven.   Service was really great, although to be fair, I was literally the only patron in the place, so it wasn't hard to feel like I was getting prompt and complete attention. The waiter / bartender Hoku was friendly, helpful, and not too hard on the eyes to boot ;)   I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!  Something interesting I learned on Wikipedia while I was eating my lunch: \"Cornish pasty\" has a \"protected geographical indication\" status (like Champagne and Roquefort do), so in order to be a true Cornish pasty, it must be prepared (though not necessarily finished or served) in Cornwall."}
{"text":"This place is everything that all the other reviews have said before me.  The food here is quite simply - awesome.  I've been a few times.  I've ordered the Cajun Pasty and the Pesto Pasty.  Both are very good options if you like chicken.  I usually eat half and save the other half for the next day.  It's still good heated up the next day.  What I like the most about this place is the food comes out remarkably quick.  I've gone for lunch on various occasions, arriving around 11:45 each time.  I've gone with one person or with 4 or 5 other people and the food always came out in a reasonable amount of time - even with the restaurant packed to the hilt with hungry folks.  I give them an A+ for their speed given their popularity.  This establishment is fairly odd in a quirky way that makes you want to return.  The decor has \"character\".  I suppose the intention is to replicate a English Pub.  I'm not sure.  They expanded the dinging room in recent years and the new dining room is full of these very long tables where the seating looks like what used to be a church bench.  A little awkward whilst you try to chump down on your pasty.  Nonetheless and church bench aside, however you have to sit, its definitely worth your time to visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Artistic ambience. Entertainment involved. Can play pool or darts. Good drinks and delicious food. A must go if you visit Vegas. A locals place to hang out."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place, entirely unique to Phoenix and one of a kind. The pasties are soooooo good! I felt like i was in Germany being served authentic food. I had the chipotle pastie and ate so much that I was way too full. I only do that when I really like something. Highly recommend! Ps I'm picky too"}
{"text":"Great place great atmosphere. I like the pilgim and the chicken greek the best. I have been eating at the Mesa tocation for the last decade, but moved downtown and love the vibe at the downtown location."}
{"text":"Not only are the pasties frickin amazing,  but the customer service is over the top. The owner saw us browsing through & asked if we've ever been there. Told him no & he just went at, explaining & answering whatever question we had. I can't remember what beer I got because I said surprise me, but lord have mercy, what a delicious ipa. & I know I should try other pasties, but that Cajun one has me hooked! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is probably where the 7 dwarves would come after their day of work.....English comfort food!!  I have a friend who loves this place, and I FINALLY made it in......so glad I did, I really didn't quite understand her description of what a pasty is, but, now I do! It's like the English version of an empanada, or like a gourmet hot pocket, haha! (ok, it really doesn't compare to a hot pocket, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to think of a good word picture!)  So, they have a million different filling options...it seems what is available on the menu might vary depending on what is fresh (LOVE food made to order that's FRESH!) The best part about this place is that they have VEGAN OPTIONS! woo hoo!!! I'm adding this place to my dairy-safe zone!   I had the vegan philly cheese steak pasty, it was very good! They really do make it fresh, mine was piping hot....for the \"steak\" they used mushrooms, and whatever kind of sauce they used for the \"cheese\" was quite savory. When you order your pasty, they give you some different sauce-on-the-side options (apparently you eat pasty with sauce?) Anyways, the marinara was really good and really complemented my pasty. (a beer would have worked really well with it too.... oh well, next time!)  My husband had the oggie and thoroughly enjoyed it was well. These things are big, by the way! If you have trouble filling up, you'll be really happy with this place! And if you don't, you'll have two meals for the day for only around 10 bucks! Not bad, right?!  Can't wait to come back here! Btw, this location is designed to look like inside a mine (read the menu for the background story on pasties) If you are claustrophobic, just sit towards the back, there is a nice big window back there. Otherwise, it is a bit dark and narrow in there, but still comfortable."}
{"text":"Those little suckers are filling.  They kinda sit like a loving brick in your gut which is why I don't frequent this place for lunch much unless I want to nap.  They have a pretty extensive list of \"pasties\" available, including quite a few vegetarian options.  They all come with dipping sauce.  The crust is to die for.  Service is good. Prompt and attentive.  Good Ice tea of the \"tropical\" variety.  Brewed.  They serve alcohol although I've never had as I've only been during lunch.  Upbeat atmosphere.  Good tunes.  What can I say, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The Oggie brought back memories of being a kid in england.. delicious! Overall decent prices for the amount of food (they might look small, but they're not), good food, and good service. Thanks to yelp for leading me here! Lose a star because they're sadly out of the Pavlova 3/4 of the time."}
{"text":"At the center of this operation is a fabulous crust. I had envisoned sort of a gigantic, doughy calzone filled with equal parts air and filling, but it's much better than that. The crust is a thin shell, like a pie crust, which gives the sandwich a firm, easy to handle structure while maximizing the filling cavity.   The chicken tikka masala was aromatic, beautifully seasoned and downright glorious. Just a wonderful sandwich, even without the complementary and complimentary yoghurt. Shepards pie and a traditional \"Oggie\" received raves as well.   Service was friendly and professional. My only quibble is that certain aspects of the decor scream Tempe dive bar more than outstanding niche restaurant - even at lunchtime. It's rather dark and small, the ceiling's painted black with what looks like auto body paint, furniture is beaten up, the back door glass is cracked and there's tacky boxes of supplies blocking what is already a narrow floor aisle.   Do I think they should invest in brass and wood paneling and pretend to be Houstons? No. I just think their food concept and execution is so unique and terrific that deferred maintenance and sloppiness around the edges kinda detracts from their hard earned, fundamental excellence.   It doesnt detract a lot. CPC honors and indeed transcends \"British Cuisine\" and is definitely worth a visit. The food is marvelous.  Service is good. Everyone seems to be having a good time.  But if you're older or fussy, like me, just dont expect Buckingham Palace."}
