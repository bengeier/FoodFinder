{"text":"On Monday, June the 1st, this was my first experience dining in El Furniture warehouse at Queen. They have two locations ( one at the Annex and Queen). My sister and I thought why not end the night with $5 meals at Elfurniture? We went and got a seat quickly. Our waitress she has long white - blonde hair and tall. My sister wanted to order an Alexander Keith and i asked politely if there was wifi. The waitress id'd my sister and gave her a nasty dirty glare while id'ing her. I don't know what her problem was but she didn't have to give a nasty devilish look even if she was having a bad day. After she i'ded my sister, i then asked her if there was wifi available. The waitress gave me a rude attitude with a \"no, we don't have wifi.\" First of all you don't need to be so god damn rude especially when you are dealing with customers like me every single day.  Secondly, yes you lied to me. There's wifi available at the restaurant. How?  My phone shows that there is wifi available. Yeah it could been for the employees only but really you could of said \"oh, sorry, our wifi is only use for our staff\". Overall once the our waitress was going to hand our order in, we just left instantly because my sister and i already knew that if we were to continue on with our dining  it would be bad enough than how it was. I will never come to the Queens location knowing that it was my first time dining at El furniture. Even the staffs at the Annex are so much friendlier than the trash service at Queen. Tips to waitress at Queens: Treat your guests how you should be treated at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Super cheap, super crowded at all times. The music is also soooooo loud and you can barely hear the people you're with (decent music though). The food is ok; you definitely get what you pay for. I always get a burger because you get a lot of food and it's always tasted decent in the past. The other menu items are more of a toss up in terms of size and quality. Drinks are the same price as everywhere else. Overall, I can't complain because you know what you're in for when you enter a place with a $5 menu."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar... visiting for the weekend, great experience. Spencer was the best and had awesome old school hip hop playing! Drinks and food major plus but kudos to Spencer for sure for being the greatest!!!"}
{"text":"had a really awesome time eating here today! my friends and I took w day trip to Toronto from Niagara Falls, NY for shopping and what not and asked around for where some cool places to eat were and we were recommended the warehouse! I still can't believe everything is seriously 4.95.... for the taste and portion size that's incredible. the drinks were awesome, service was super awesome, the only thing is we ended up waiting a while for our food but we didn't mind! the queso dip they have is SO GOOD. also, wassup hot bartender with the long hair?"}
{"text":"Cheap food. For younger crowd, most people look 19 year old.
They make people wait outside the door even though there are seats inside. So don't believe that that line you see is real!"}
{"text":"Great service, and for the price, it was really good food and good portions. We had the quesadilla and the chicken caesar wrap. Both were delicious! Definitely recommend it for students or anyone on a budget."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Warehouse because of it's roots in Vancouver. It was a favourite of mine when I was in my early 20's! But my first and only visit was a disappointment. I ordered a Whiskey Sour and it was the most disgusting drink I have ever tasted. It actually gave me indigestion, it was so bad. My food arrived after 40 min and I had to get my own cutlery after trying to hunt some down for 10 min. Our server looked like she hated her life. Actually, all of the servers looked miserable! I don't think I saw any of them smiling. It was really weird... I have been a server for well over 8 years and I don't think I have ever had such an awful experience in a restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went twice, once on week day, once during weekend.  Both times were good.

Food - was great, tasted fine, it's not gourmet, but what more can you ask for $5?
Service - very nice and friendly staff, they seated us quickly and food/drinks were served without delay.
Ambiance - it's a dive bar so it's not a 5 star restaurant but that's understood when you go there.  I enjoyed the 90's music they played which brings back memories of high school.

Overall it's a good place to hang out and grab a quick bite.  I advise to go during the day as I can imagine at night it'll get crowded."}
{"text":"First time at either location and was very impressed. For a Sunday night it wasn't
overly crowded and I was seated right away. Atmosphere is relatively loud but at the same time cozy and around 8pm they dim the lights. For $4.95 the food was awesome and plentiful. The Nachos for One can easily be split as an app for 2. The mini donuts for dessert are a must. Only recommendation is more local craft beer on the menu. Only IPA on the menu was Keith's if you consider that one. Overall great location and food, will definitely return."}
{"text":"My favorite bar!
This place just opened recently and I'm so happy it did! I'd been to El Furniture on Bloor and loved it but is a bit far from me. This one is just as good! Same delicious cheap food and great music, the servers are all babes and everyone seems to have a great time. The bartenders bounce around and sing along they have so much energy, it's fun to watch. Just saw that they have brunch now, I haven't tried it yet but hope to soon it looks amazing for just $5!"}
{"text":"The food is good for $5, can't complain. But the customer service is terrible!!! They mixed up my mine and my friend's burgers and instead of getting us the right burgers the waitress goes \"can't you two switch??....what do you two have cooties??\" I was so shocked. And then she realized that had in fact they had given me the wrong burger, so she went back to get me a new one. But grabbed my plate and handed it to my friend. Didn't even offer her a new burger. Any other restaurant would have apologized and offered a new plate."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Long waits. Also they told me I couldn't work there because I didn't have a certain look. Lucky me :)"}
{"text":"So...
I never judge a place right off the bat. I know that every establishment has it's \"off\" nights and really good ones which can be dependent on variety of factors. That being said, I've been to this place 3 times.

The first time was in the fall. I came alone during the lunch hour and sat at the bar. I ordered a white wine and the Twisted Greens salad with chicken. It seemed well prepared and it was delivered fairly quickly. The wine was meh; tasted cheap. Two girls sat at the bar and ordered mac 'n' cheese, fries and burgers. They kept giving dirty looks to my humble salad and I.

The second time I was here for New Year's Eve. My server was decent. I ordered wings and fries. They were cooked well and piping hot like I like them. The bar was FULL of obnoxious bros who kept sending me shots which I politely declined (I had been drinking wine and I get sick when I mix in hard liquor). Obviously not the wait staff's fault but some dude kept coming over and grabbing me every 5 mins or so, conveniently forgetting my name or the fact that I have a man. He eventually bump into our little table with such force in his drunken stupor that he knocked over 3 glasses which shattered on the ground

Today was my third and final visit here. I ordered the mac 'n' cheese as an app and split it with my girl. Then came my Twisted Greens salad. Midway through, I felt a stringy, dry substance in my mouth. I gingerly put my finger to my tongue and pulled out a GIANT, DRY-ASS-IN-DESPERATE-NEED-OF-CONDITIONER BLACK HAIR WITH A BLONDE OMBRE end. Now, this hair is not the colour or texture of my own so I knew it wasn't from me. I told my waitress and she offered to bring me another salad but I'd lost my appetite by then. So did my girl. She took about one bite of her burger before deciding it wasn't worth the risk. I was still charged for my drink and the waitress split the mac 'n' cheese. The salad was removed from the bill.

Before we left, I went to use a bathroom. I caught a glimpse of the chef who was a short haired young man with a baseball cap on. This leads me to believe that the lettuce for the salad is kept in a large mixing bowl and the hair belongs to whoever put it there, meaning that the entire batch should be discarded.

Whilst in the bathroom, some annoying drunk bros kept banging on the door like crazy. I opened it and hit them with a \"Are you good fam?\" Both culprits kept scrolling through their phones refusing to acknowledge my existence.Just as I was out of earshot I heard one of them say \"Dude, you should've asked her for her number.\" Um, no dude, you shouldn't have.

My recommendation is to try Java House at Queen and Augusta. Similar prices, WAY better menu selection, same dive bar feel and the music decibel won't make your eardrums bleed."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place last week. it was 8pm and there were 5-6 folks standing in line. Got in easily, with 2 other friends. Their menu is great, all food items are at $4.95, drinks are little expensive, but that to make up for the food i guess, it got really busy as the night progressed and line at entrance grown to around 50-60 people. All in all great music and service. Definitely repeat. They dont accept Debit, they do have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. If I could give no stars I would. Stopped in for the deal they have, everyday all day. Got the \"marinated chicken tacos\" and the lightly breaded fish tacos. 

25min after ordering the dingbat waitress comes back and say I'm so sorry, I forgot to put in your order. I just wanna make sure this is what you guys got. \"So much for a quick lunch\"

Full hour and 25min later we get old dried chicken rolled up into tacos. Hard, dried out over fried batter they called fish wrapped in a lovely taco shell. Felt like it was the ends of a deep fried fish, two small ones the size of a loonie dropped between a pile of lettuce. 

They charged $3 for 2 small hot sauces and $1 for a garbage guac.

In life it doesn't matter how cheap it is, if a place is selling themselves on discount, go somewhere else and save your money and your stomach ache."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just discovered this place! Everything on the menu is only $4.95 so you really can't go wrong! Definitely a great place if you're on a budget, especially when food can get expensive in Toronto. I ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap which has marinated chicken, caesar dressing, kale, lettuce, and parmesan cheese in a tomato tortilla, with fries on the side. A really good deal for a whole meal! Although the wrap was smaller than I expected, the side of fries still got me full. 

There are patio and indoor seating available. My friends and I sat inside, and the lighting was very dim. I did not mind since the weather was pretty nice outside. However, they were blasting music on full volume, and it made the conversating very difficult. Service was pretty good but our server was constantly trying to get us to order more than just one item. But that's understandable considering the price of the meal.

Overall, a very good and inexpensive place to eat. I would come back again, but probably just for the take-out option."}
{"text":"Really cool place where you get bang for your buck, but the service here was HORRIBLE from start to finish, one mistake to the next would not recommend to come here unless just to get drunk. 

As a party of 6 on a Tuesday night, we were seated at one of their booth seatings (fits 4 comfortably, 6 = sardines), but is understandable as the bigger tables were occupied. As our server (Kyra, Kyla, Kayla?) came to take our drink order (Ordered 1 Sapporo, 1 Pink Lemonade, 1 Blue Hawaii, 2 Sour Key, 1 Crazy Canuck) everything went downhill from there. Also at one point the bartender had randomly sprayed water at us...

Once she finally arrived with our drinks, she announced the wrong drinks and forgot a drink. Then when we placed our food order she asked if we were paying separately which we said yes to, and she replied to remind her which drink we ordered so she can place the items to the drink accordingly (Looking back she could've just repeated the order so there wouldn't be any mistakes, or start from one person and go clockwise - she did not do this). 

After a while waiting, we had ask to be moved to a bigger table which she said yes to.
As we reached the bigger table, our food came in about 15 minutes, and again 2 orders we placed were missing (yam fries & quesadilla) and 2 other food items came that we did not order (wings & a burger). After explaining to thee food runner the situation, he brought the latter items back into the kitchen, and it was handled in a calm manner with him (Thumbs up to him).

The final straw, was the dreaded bill. She kept running back to the POS system and to our table so we can remind her what we had ordered, but even when she kept doing that she still didn't remember what we had told her 5 seconds ago. To which she kept saying \"God this is so confusing\". Finally, after going around the table settling individually, she announced we have yet to pay for the wings and burger which were clearly brought back. We then told her no we paid for everything already, and that she had punched items we did not order into the POS, to which she had the audacity to tell us we were wrong and then she yelled at the food runner to come over (which is wrong cause he's just the middle man). She then went back to the POS system came back and said that we still owed her money as the \"money\" she had in her hand was not enough - which was not true as the 2 girls in my party had given her cash at the beginning and did not ask for change back. Again, she went back to her POS system.

At this point we were all just fed up as clearly it was her problem, and lack of ownership to her mistake so we just left. 

All in all, the evening would have been fine as the food was okay, the music and vibe was awesome, but once you get bad service, thats all you can remember. 


TL:DR - Food was okay, service by Kyla, Kyra, Kayla?? was subpar."}
{"text":"This place is awful and is filled with awful people. Splurge an extra $5 and spend your money somewhere that is run by actual decent human beings."}
{"text":"The one in Vancouver is much better more cooler and better food..I went here with some friends had burgers, wings, and some drinks...the burger tasted awful like it's been frozen and the wings we got were gross they were sooo raw blood was gushing out... I wouldn't eat the food here which is a shame.. Because the one in Vancouver is amazing"}
{"text":"2.5 stars 

For $4.95 food, I can see why this place is always packed. But be warned, this place is as loud as a club (you can actually feel your ears ringing after) and people on bar table doing shots with the bartenders, again like what you see in clubs. We were definitely not expecting this, and we couldn't even talk to each other, so left pretty much as soon as we ate and had a drink.

Food was great especially for the price point, but the drinks is where they get you as everything is at least $6. The service was alright, our server was slow to take our order at first but food did arrive very quickly.

Personally won't be back to this location as it is too noisy for me. I heard that the Bloor location is no where like this, so may give that one a go."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant out.  A number of friends recommended the place, so my boyfriend and I went.  We waited 15 minutes to get inside, which was fine, then when we got a seat we had to wait 15 minutes for the server to come around - okay no big deal, it was super busy on a beautiful day, that can be expected.  We put our whole order in at once - 2 cokes, an app and a warehouse burger and a smokey bbq burger.  It toon 20 minutes for our drinks to come, and they were flat, 45 minutes for our app to come, and another 45 minutes for our food to come, and they brought the wrong burger for my boyfriend.  The burger was gross, I can honestly say I would much rather a McDonald's burger, and I cannot stand McDonalds.  Both burgers were cold, tasted like they had freezer burn.  Horrible.  Once we were done eating, it took the server another 20 minutes to come over to us and clear the table and then another 20 minutes to get the bill.  She was useless, and had the personality of a dead fish.  Did not smile once.  

I get it is busy and they have a lot of orders, but based on how people rave about this, I don't get it.  It does not make sense.  It is an okay experience, it has horrible food, and it has horrible staff."}
{"text":"The wait line is long but I did not mind that. When we got seated, my friends and I got the patio, it was a bit chilly that day but it was alright. What bugged me was that the waitress took 15 minutes to get us some water when the water station was just next to us... We could of just gotten some ourselves if she was too busy....then we ordered perogies and a dip as appetizers and Mac and cheese for dinner. Mind you, they brought everything out all together instead of brining out the appetizers first...and only to bring some of the appetizers back because our table was too small....this could of been solved if they brought the appetizers first....and the wait for the food took 40 MINUTES. Yes we've waited 40 mins in the cold patio for our food to come...and halfway through our meal a homeless guy would come by begging for change and then decided TO TRY OUR FOOD AND took a chip AND DIPPED INTO OUR FOOD TO EAT IT. That's when we just called for the bill. When another waiter came by to ask us how the service was going I've politely told him the food was great but some random homeless man just ate our food ...he just apologized and that was it. No sort of compensation. Nothing. I really wanted to get a good experience out of this after hearing so many great things about it...but we've left with a sour note."}
{"text":"Foods cheap, $5 dollars everything on the menus except if it says otherwise. Can't go wrong with 5 bucks, but my only complaint is that it is too loud and I could barely hear my girlfriend or the waitress for that matter."}
{"text":"The bar offers $5 food and decent beer. I didn't expect much for the price, but I was very pleasantly surprised - you actually get full portions, not just sliders or appetizers. Granted, the quality lacks compared to most restaurants, but it's great for the price.

The place is big, but always full, be ready to wait even on weekdays, especially if you're showing up at prime time. The interior is nice for a supposed dive bar, the skateboard decorations are fun."}
{"text":"All in all, I'd give this place 3 stars

Pros: 
Every food selection is exactly $5!!! Where can you get a good meal that is $5 now days?!

Plays BANGER songs ! Everyone's always dancing or singing along


Cons:
Every alcoholic drink is waaayyy OVERPRICED  (in fair, it is to make up for cheap food)

Plays great music, BUT it can be suuuuperrr loud. So loud that would have to basically SCREAM your order to the waitress

There's almost always a long line to get inside the venue  (about 15-35 minutes)

There's not enough washrooms! On top of waiting in line outside, there's almost a line to use the washroom as well


It's a chill place to be but wouldn't recommend going on a date or something. More like a place for friends and quick eats"}
{"text":"-5 stars

I had the displeasure of experiencing this bar twice and am now assured I will never go back.  I gave it a second chance to see if perhaps I was just unlucky once.

Our server took our drink and food order at the same time. My friend ordered water and I ordered a martini, which came in a rock glass.  My friend and I both ordered the Chicken Caesar Kale wrap with peppered fries.  Our drinks took 15 minutes to arrive.

Fifteen minutes after the drinks arrived, the server came around and finally noticed my glass was empty and asked if I would like another round.  I simply answered 'no....'.  Before I could even finish my sentence, with a disgusted look on her face, she grabbed the rock glass and started to take off, just as I was about to order a different drink.  Because the music is blaring, I had to yell, 'excuse me' twice, to get her attention.  She turned back and I asked her if I could order a different drink.  I ordered a vodka/7up, which instead showed up at the table 10 min later as a vodka/tonic.  

It was now 40 min after my friend and I ordered the 2 wraps and peppered fries and still no food and no server in sight.  I finally flagged down another server and asked her if she could ask our server to come to our table.  When the server arrived, I relayed to her the following, \"sorry to bother you, but we ordered our food 40 min ago and I was wondering.....\" and she bolted before I could finish my sentence.  Within minutes she brought the food to our table and again, with a look of disgust on her face remarked to me as she put the plates down, \"it's only been 35 min!!\".  Who says that to a customer???  No apology, no care, no professionalism, no friendliness, just MAJOR ATTITUDE!!!

Our wraps were 90% kale, 5% dressing and 5% frozen, prepackaged, tiny chicken cubes, inside the tortilla.  The frozen fries were so peppered, that I could only eat a handful and left most of my meal, including the wrap on my plate and left hungry, as did my friend.  The chicken/fries were cold and probably sitting at the pass for quite some time.  No doubt the server and the food runners had forgotten it there.  With that kind of filling and frozen food, it's no wonder it's $4.95.

The server didn't once come to ask how the food was or whether we needed anything else.  We never saw her again, until I went outside for a smoke and noticed 5 servers and one hostess outside all taking a break at the same time, while the restaurant/bar was PACKED inside.  As a former server/bartender myself, we never took breaks together and only took a break, once the flow of customers died down, never while it's busy and never in herds.

Even though this is a restaurant/bar and NOT A CLUB, you could go deaf with the booming volume that the DJ insists on playing the music.  My friend and I had to lean into the table and yell at each other to try to have conversation but failed.  This is definitely not the place for conversation with friends or date friendly.  I noticed when we left that my friend and I both had sore throats from screaming for an hour and a half.

Normally if service  is decent, I'll tip %15.  If a happy experience was created by a high level of standard by a server, I will tip %20 or more.  Our server's disgruntled attitude and consistent disappearing act, got her exactly what she deserved - her hourly wage and no tip.

If I could give this place minus stars I gladly would.  No one should have to endure attitude from a server, any where, any time.  I hope this place folds or management gets their act together and starts training their servers.  Great service doesn't mean taking orders and delivering food.  It's about being polite, friendly, attentive, professional and creating an experience for customers so that they'll want to return.  The owner(s) obviously doesn't care for repeat business, quality staff, quality food, customer satisfaction or a good reputation.

Disgusted..."}
{"text":"I will just say you get what you pay for. My partner and I get in we wait over an hour for the food the waitress tells us this drink which is meant to be amazing and was $25.00 for two which she didn't tell us. The food was dry and we both felt sick after. Will not recommend to anyone! It's worth paying a little bit more for food to just get eatable dishes."}
{"text":"It was nice experience.
Following suggestions:

1. Drnks contain only ice so ask for less ice or no ice at all.
2. Food takes time so try to order in a way that u dont hv to wait for 1 hr or so."}
{"text":"Great concept food is decent but service is slow.   45 mins for lunch to arrive and the restaurant wasn't packed"}
{"text":"Great food for only $4.95! Needless to say, the waiting time is a little long but worthy it. Great vibes!"}
{"text":"I've visited this establishment on multi occasions, so this review is not based on a single unfortunate incident. To start, understand that you will get what you pay for - a $5 burger tastes nothing more than a $5 burger; and as for the soft tacos, let's just say they tasted like turd to put it nicely. Also be warned that any side or extra anything the wait staff offers will almost certainly cost extra, therefore read the fine prints on the menu and inquire when ordering to avoid surprises. Lastly, don't expect common courtesy from staff. During a late lunch, with no one really waiting for tables, our waitress had the genius idea of bringing bills and the credit card machine while I was still eating. I had to remind myself that the $5 pays for the meal only, customer service excluded."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening after work. There was a decent sized lineup outside which moved pretty quickly. 

We were seated in the patio. It was fairly loud but the dining room was much louder. It was a hot summer day so patio was a good choice. They had no air conditioning inside.

Ordered the Chori-queso dip, soft tacos with chicken and chaing mai bowl. The food took a fairly long time to arrive. The dip and bowl was pretty good. The bowl had some curry at the bottom, which I didnt appreciate too much; looked like they got lazy in the cooking. I wouldn't recommend the tacos since they tasted a bit dry. The accompanying condiments helped. 

Pros: Cheap, decent food
Cons: crowded, loud, possibly large wait times for food and seating."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: All items under $5 (always options to add sides and toppings for a little extra). Drinks are NOT cheap however. I had the Mac & Cheese and the Yam Fries. Both dishes were delicious for the price.

Facility: Typical pub atmosphere but the washrooms were pretty gross. They were modern but everything was falling apart. Soap dispensers were empty, hand dryer broken, floor was filthy... they definitely need to put in some sort of cleaning schedule with the staff. We sat on the patio which I much preferred to sitting inside (music inside was full blast, good luck holding a conversation). The only problem with the patio is that there were a lot of fruit flies/gnat flying around, so it an get annoying.

Service: Service was generally good. As other echoed, food came out quite slowly. I ordered Yam Fries as app and the Mac & Cheese as main, but they both came out at the same time (bleh) - waited about 20 - 30 minutes. Waitress was lovely though. Checked back frequently and refilled our glasses when they were empty. She was friendly and held good conversation (I don't remember her name, but she looked like a shorter Margot Robbie). We stayed for quite a long time and she NEVER hurried us along. Didn't even passive-aggressively leave the bill on the table (which I appreciated) until we asked for it.

Overall: I would definitely return for the price and the value. Don't go expecting gourmet!! It's ALWAYS packed. On a Thursday night, there is always a line up outside. I really enjoyed my time at The Warehouse!! Great for young college students looking for a cheap eat!!"}
{"text":"Queen St Warehouse is freakin awesome. Firstly, at 5 bucks for food (any food!) you would expect it to be kinda crappy, but it was soooooo yummy! And the portions were big! Definitely did not need to order all the stuff I did, cause I was not able to eat it all!! The vibe in there is good and it's party tone at night. Definitely a place to check out!!"}
{"text":"If you're the kind of person looking up the review of this place, it's an excellent bet you aren't the demographic of who is going here (those between 19-22 and stupid).

The model here is cheap food with fraudulently priced drinks...order a pint of beer and get a half pint (at best) for $7...everything is geared towards the young drinker crowd plowing through expensive drinks.

Service is of the \"young women dressed like hookers who know little to nothing about service\".

To recap my evening.

- Appetizer arrived (finally after asking about it four times) when we were nearly finished our mains.

- Told the server I didn't want the hamburger sauce, onions, tomato or cheese...but wanted mustard...got tacked with a $1 mustard charge (not kidding) and, of course, the burger arrived with the tomato (had to be sent back as I am allergic).

- Forks never arrived (gave up and ate the perogies with our hands)

- My 2nd beer was asked for THREE times and never arrived.

So...no cutlery...no beer...app arrived way late and my burger was wrong...not sure there was anything that went right, frankly....just a comedy of errors...will never return."}
{"text":"Most definitely always a good time from the couple times I have been. While the food I have tried from them isn't the best, it's pretty dirt cheap and the portion size is good. The baja fish taco were pretty tasty, along with the price and it is one of the better dishes that I have gotten from them. Definitely suggest sitting at the bar since it allows you to get out of the line quick and the bartenders are pretty nice. I also appreciate the fact that they have a hook underneath the bar which allow you to hang your bag and jacket if you want to.

Not sure about the waiting time since there are sometimes pretty long lines to get in, it depends on if you are willing to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Great place for snacking and chilling. Great music and nice patio! Great tasting food with fair portions. Staff are friendly but a little delayed, must be because the place was packed with people for lunch. The wait was well worth the wait. Thanks guys for a great experience."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting intimate conversation - the music is always blaring. Other than that, the food is cheap and delicious (especially the donuts). 
I wouldn't seek out this restaurant, but if you're in the area and want a quick and cheap eat then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service.  Got there around 4:30pm, there was a group of kids waiting outside (4 of them).  I ask if they were in line and they said they weren't and that I can go ahead.  I go inside, half empty, we're asked how many seats, I say 3, snotty hostess asks if we can wait outside \"behind those people\".  I told her that we spoke to them earlier and they said they weren't in line.  She gives us major attitude and tells us to go wait outside.  If you're ever walking by and see a line up, it's manufactured to create hype, and NOT because the place is hoping.

I'm not the one who puts hipsters down, to each their own, I don't care.  But wow...Every cliche you have ever heard about hipsters comes alive in this place.  Bartenders  look like they smell like pee (think Wayne's World), and all waitstaff look like Instagram whores.

To cut the long story short, it was ONE HOUR before we got our food that was nachos, salad and pierogies to start, with burger, and two order of tacos for main.  ONE HOUR.  There were two tables of people who came in after us, they were served, ATE THEIR FOOD AND WERE OUT THE DOOR when our food arrived.  Soon after a party of 14 came in and their food was out in a jiffy.

Food was okay, nothing spectacular, all costs $5 (plain) with options to add things for $1.95.  I added side of \"guac\" for my tacos - it looked like vomit and it was watery.  It came in those tiny black containers you get with takeout - not worth $2.

Will absolutely not go here again ever in my life nor will any of my friends."}
{"text":"Cool spot for old school hiphop.  Busy every night of the week. Price of food is good.  Douchy hipster crowd tho and lineups never seem to move.   They only let ppl in for how many seats are available.  Can't just chill at the bar."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Definitely a different atmosphere than I am used to. The music was of the emo/hardcore variety, with old skateboarding videos or taking back Sunday music videos on the tvs. All of the staff were super hipster, a little eccentric, but friendly. 

The food ranged from great to just okay. I ordered the quinoa apple salad w/chicken (great!), the sweet potato fries which come with an aioli sauce (also great), the chicken tacos (pretty good but a little skimpy) and also the works burger (just okay). Overall, very satisfied with my meal especially given the price. 

They have a decent selection of bottled beers / beers on tap, and unlike most hipster bars the wine is actually reasonably priced if that's your thing. 

One thing that they need to change is their waiting list system. Basically, everyone lines up outside and waits to get in. No names are taken or anything. Then, the welcomer comes around every now and then and asks how many you are. It does not matter where you are in line: if you have a party of 4 and there is a table for four available, you will jump ahead of a party of 2 that has been waiting for 20 minutes. This happened to us multiple times (party of 2), and seemed to piss a lot of people off in the line. 

Overall, pretty cool spot. I would come back for drinks and some snacks, but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"Always a party at Warehouse! Love the food! Love the drinks! Love the staff! One of my fave spots in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great place if you are with a big crowd wanting to have a good time... Lots of people so if you want to chill and chat with friends that's not where u want to go... Food and drinks are very reasonably priced, and the food is pretty tasty :)"}
{"text":"(First of all.. I have always loved the warehouse.. in Vancouver. Their burger was amazing and tasted like a $15 deluxe burger. You can never go wrong with any other dishes too.)  I came to Toronto expecting the same quality food but the burger was the saddest thing. It tasted like a old McDonald's burger with an extra slice of bacon. Tasted exactly like a \"$5 burger\". The changmai bowel is basically udon+veggies+too much teriyaki sauce... tasted like what you get in a food court. I'm not even angry I'm honestly just so sad and disappointed because warehouse has always held a special spot in my heart. 
+2 star for the atmosphere + service."}
{"text":"Good portions for the price. 7/10 taste. Great service and vibe. Had the mushroom burger with soup, friend got the spicy burger with fries and mac and cheese. All worth."}
{"text":"whats more to say? Queen Street Warehouse is a much needed dose of laid back vibes, and refreshing atmosphere. It doesn't matter what day of the week.. this place is ALWAYS bumping. Come hungry, leave happy... and don't blame them for the hangover in the morning."}
{"text":"Really like this place. I would give it 3 and half stars. The atmosphere was good-- good vibes, also they played a really good selection of music as someone has already mentioned before.

My friend and I went there for drinks. We actually stumbled upon this place by accident. We we're suppose to (I think) bar hop but just ended up staying at this place we liked it so much. 

For a Sunday night the place was pretty full and happening.

Would definitely come back to try their food and just chill."}
{"text":"Cons: They almost never answer their phone. The place is almost ALWAYS STACKED. Expect to wait around 20minutes for a seat during lunchtime/dinner time. The bar tenders are really loud and obnoxious (could easily be heard telling patrons to shutup in a loud sarcastic manner) and the music they play just doesnt agree with my ears. Also the entire scene is just very loud and can get uncomfortable at times when youre just trying to enjoy your meal. They dont accept Interac-debit, forcing you to use their ATM that sucks more money out your account in the form of bank fees.

Pros: The food is good. The wait times for menu turnover are more than decent especially considering just how stacked they are for lunch/dinner. And the servers are friendly and on spot.

One thing to note: they have \"coffee\" listed as an item on their menu but actually dont serve any at all whatsoever. I found this peculiar especially after our server hinted that a large amount of customers request it on a daily basis (seems like lost profit to me). 

Also DONT let the menu prices fool you. The food items are cheaper than beverages. Order around 3-4 drinks and 2-3 plates and youve already racked up a sizeable bill that doesnt include tip or your trip to the ATM fee.

Id visit again but Im not overly eager to. Ill try a few more places before I settle on this one again. They really need to do something about the noise levels though. We wouldve ordered more drinks and dessert but left earlier because our ears started ringing."}
{"text":"Clean. Overpriced drinks. The only element that really made it similar to a dive bar was my greasy haired bartender. He kinda looked like he also works at a 24 hour internet cafe and has very strong opinions regarding today's state of electronic music. I went in for a weekday, post-work beer. The restaurant itself was fairly busy but the bar only had a few patrons. I drank my beer and threw some loot on the bar. Greasy bartender was too busy to cash me out though because he was showing a few girls at the bar each of his tattoos. Maybe if I had a pair of tits, I wouldn't have to wait 10 minutes with money and an empty pint glass before I could leave. This place would probably get more stars from me if I indeed had tits, and wanted attention from a bartender who looked like he was in Fubar."}
{"text":"Good prices, good vibe, decent food and cheap drinks. 
Sometimes the wait to be seated is a bit long"}
{"text":"Warehouse on Queen is always packed with people, usually with long lines extending outside of the restaurant. Why? Because everything is $5.95! Talk about a bang for your buck! 

First off, there is a rule where guests need to be 19+ but usually, they'll let you in no matter the age. However, I've only been for lunch so perhaps they are more strict for nighttime? Dining here is perfect when the weather is nice! Their outdoor seating options are perfect for dates or a quick and friendly catch up session! Inside seating is more hectic and clammy. 

The menu contains all the typical comfort foods that you would dream up! Macaroni & cheese, perogies, poutine, wings, tacos... you name it, and they've got it! 

Now, in terms of pure food quality, this place is just a little below mediocre. I've tried several dishes and the first few bites are good, but then you i just get tired of it. That's why I would suggest getting plates to share instead of your own meal when with a group. The works burger is the typical BBQ (at home style) burger while the fries are simply drenched in pepper. Mac and cheese is bland, and the perogies are really doughy. HOWEVER, keep i mind that your paying $6 per dish so quality is expected to no be extremely high. Portions are excellent and quite hefty! 

If you're looking for typical comfort food and you're on a budget, then this place is perfect for you! However, if you're looking to satisfy your stomach, and wouldn't mind spending a bit more at the other amazing Downtown food places, then don't bother waiting for a seat, and getting disappointed with the quality. Yes it's cheap, but there's so many other options for similar prices, especially on Queen St.!"}
{"text":"Out of towner stopped in on a whim. Jesus - this place is incredible. Amazing prices, really damn good food too and service was the best I've ever experienced. No joke. Maybe it's just Canada and Canadians but this is a must go to for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Well, there are a few reasons to visit the Queen St Warehouse.

1. Cheap eats! $5 for each item and the portions are decent.  I actually really liked my swiss cheese mushroom burger on a toasty greasy bun.

2. They show fun music videos.  TLC, Ma$e, Big Pun, talk about your waaaay back playback tracks!

3. Convenient location - We came here on a Tuesday after watching a movie at Scotiabank.  It was packed but we didn't have to wait long to be seated.

The service isn't quick but they are crazy busy.  It's loud, rowdy, dark, but a fun place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Amazing vibes - love the music, decor and the people there

Food - we had the braised beef spaghetti and pulled chicken sandwich. It absolutely exceeded our expectations, possibly due to the cheap price. 

Definitely will go back for their cocktail Caesar, which I heard its really good. The only thing I would note is that the server seemed to be too efficient that she handed over a check when we wanted to have more drinks."}
{"text":"Pros: Cheap food (everything on the menu is $5 and the portions are decent - between myself and my boyfriend we ordered perogies as a starter to share & a burger for mains each and we were full - he had the works burger & I had the pulled chicken sandwich - all yummy, I highly recommend the sandwich, next time instead of a starter though I think we'll share a salad with our mains) & really fun vibe (there was a live DJ when we went who was playing cheesy 90s tracks). Cons: Drinks are pretty expensive (that's how they make their money I guess), the music inside is blaring (like, uncomfortably so - you can barely hear people), they don't take debit - just cash or credit (like, not even Visa Debit!?) & the service isn't great (our server was obviously overloaded & she got snippy when 1 of our friends asked for his drink which he had ordered 20 mins beforehand & when she was collecting the plates, she spilled food onto my lap (not a big deal but there was no apology or acknowledgement even). I'll definitely go again, for the cheap food if nothing else, but I'll just wait for a spot on the patio where the music won't be so loud (& I'll make sure I have cash on me!)."}
{"text":"The service was good and quick, a good selection of beer on tap, and the $5 apps/meals were very tasty at a great price. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not bad for such a cheap food but you get what you pay for. We ordered \"the works\" burger and the patty was worse than mcdonalds. Fries were literally covered with black pepper. Kale salad barely had any dressing. Sun dried tomato pasta was pretty good though"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to if you love waiting for 30 minutes to get into only to wait an additional 50 minutes before your food hits the table (ON A WEDNESDAY). Your waitress will walk up to with most obvious fake smile on her face and not give a ship about what you want. If you're lucky, you'll even catch her rolling her eyes after she takes your order and walks away. The music is nice and loud which makes having conversation difficult! But hey, who really wants to have a conversation when you're eating and drinking? The one saving grace for this place is that the food (when it eventually came out) was pretty decent. I had the mac and cheese which was heavenly. The tacos were great (get the guac, trust me) both fish and vegetarian. The yam fries and onion rings were yam fries and onion rings, you can't really mess that up. I had the best mediocre $14 Olde Fashioned I've ever had there. If you plan on going with a large group, and don't mind over paying for drinks (although $6.75 for domestic pints isn't too bad) and love the idea that all dishes are $4.95 then this is the place for you. I recommend sitting outside (if it isn't too hot) as you can catch a pretty sweet view of the tower from the patio. All in all this place was more hype than anything for me. Good for some drinks and cheap eats with a crew. Would not recommend for a date."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch with my friends. We decided to be seated outside with the warm weather. We ordered smoke bbq burger and it was delish with their chicken chowder soup and ordered yam fries on the side. Can never go wrong with 5.95 menu. Will hang out more there if i have company."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, but I think the music can be turned down a smidge. 

There are basically line ups all day long since everything on the menu is under $5. The $5 price is the starting point and as you add additional items for your meal, it adds up. The drinks here are good, but are pricier relative to other places to make up for the cheaper food items.

Overall, a decent place to hang out any day of the week. Just be ready to wait in line."}
{"text":"No idea why this place had a queue, myself and everyone I was with were thoroughly let down by the service. Getting into the place didnt take too long but once we got in we were looking to order some shots to start the night. We asked the waitress about a few of the shots, but alas she had no idea what was going. I wasn't sure if she was knew or had some brain damage from how loud the music was. Either way we were not feeling it. The whole evening were subjected to the bitterness that could only come with an aged lemon. We ordered drinks which took their time arriving and when I received my \"strong\" long island ice tea, I could only describe it as limp. No alcohol, basically a lemon coke. Despite my nostalgia I was not pleased. This was described as a triple long island, yet it came in the same glass as we received our shots in. When I brought the waitresses notice to this she seemed to care very little but sorted me out with a larger lemon coke. The food was okay for $5 but they clearly make up any loss by the extortionate price of the drinks. Would not recommend coming here at all. In my country we arent obliged to tip, but as I was in Canada I felt I must. I even felt that the 5% I left was too much."}
{"text":"I've always walked by this place and wondered why there were always huge lineups outside. Finally tried it and waited about half an hour. The wait was longer for us because we wanted a patio seat.  

Overall I wasn't too impressed with the place. The crowd was quite young. The food was very average but I guess you get what you pay for, since the almost all the food is 4.95 per dish. Perhaps we just didn't choose the best options. I would also be careful with all the add-ons the servers suggest because they can quickly add up

I had the baked mac and cheese, added the bacon for 1.95 which really made the dish $7 instead of 5. I didn't get the bread which was another 2.25 on top (I think?)

The person I was with had the beet and goat cheese salad. Seemed very average..they used iceberg lettuce and there is an extra charge for chicken. 

We also got some honey garlic wings. Again very average I think came with 5 or 6 pcs, And the blue cheese dip was an extra $1. 

I had a cocktail that they \"doubled\" for $3 extra. I sort of question if they really did because the drink tasted a little weak. I would just get a shot and pour it in yourself.

Seems like its ok for a quick cheap bite and some drinks before having a night out, but I dont think it would really be worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"During the day this is a great spot, get a seat by the window enjoy some beers and cheap bites and watch the rush outside. Even during the day this place gets busy really quick and I don't think i have seen it otherwise.

The food is pretty cheap, 5 bucks and worth the money. (Cheap is not going to equal great food). I came here the other Sunday and it was so busy at 11pm that I was shocked and god damn it turn the music down! I don't know how people have a conversation inside. 

The staff i have good and bad experiences with. The one time me and a friend stood there and could not spot anyone working so we sat outside where there were plenty of tables only to be asked by a girl who looked like she just finished a day shift at kensington flea market, advise us we need to wait to be seated. 
So we obliged and went and stood at the front again for a few minutes until.......I said f*k this and sat right back outside where we did originally. Pointless exercise I felt. 

I definitely would go back just because it is a fun hangout place and further away from the usual hipster spots on queen west. I saw some people there drinking some cocktails with upside down beer bottles in them so curiiousity if anything will drag me back."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend and had to wait for a bit to get in, but definitely worth it. There always seems to be a line up here because it is so popular. There is a big hipster crowd here and they play good music. I got to sit on the patio with my friend and I quite enjoyed my experience. Our server was great and we understood that they are all really busy. For $5 you would think the food would be just okay, but I thought it was pretty tasty and a good sized portion. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu at this price, but I do recommend the works burger which is also a favourite choice. I decided to substitute for onion rings for an extra $1.95 and it was worth it. They also have a pretty good drink menu with lots of options. So come for the cheap food and stay for the good drinks. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other menu items!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The entries are really good for only 5 dollars. My friends and I usually don't have to wait in line long and it has a nice atmosphere. Wish the music inside was a little softer though"}
{"text":"It was okay. It's a little hard to have a conversation here because the music is so loud, so if you want a place to chat with friends or a date maybe this isn't the place. For drinks and cheap food, though, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Honestly these prices are awesome and the drink service is quick. Food is decent given the price. Everyone at the table enjoyed the dingy atmosphere and music. The line up outside definitely creates a sense of ~mystery but if you can slip in it's a good time."}
{"text":"Place is a blast.  $5 for most food item on menu and portion is generous.  Music playing loudly with old school jams.  Only problem is this place is always packed and you have to line up to get in.  They won't take down your name or give you a number.  Just have to wait in line outside the place causing high traffic jam on the sidewalk.  I got the burger and wings and they were pretty good.  The drinks are awesome as well.  Will def be back for more yummy cheap food.  Services were nice and attentive as well."}
{"text":"The price has gone up a couple dollars but the food is still cheap as hell! Was $4.99 to $5.95 now.There's always a line up outside but the wait isn't so bad. Great place to go if you wanna have fun with a group of friends and or even a date. The music is pretty up there with all the throwbacks and such, so tip:  not the best place to have a full-blown out conversation ..although on the bright side, the food is preeeeetty good, can't even complain for what it's worth. The poutine is always filling enough to share with two people. Wings were a bit saucy but the size made up for it and the smokey bbq burger was a good, nothing crazy. I wouldn't really suggest getting drinks here though because they are a bit pricey around $7. A friend I went with asked for a double shot, it didn't taste like a double because it wasn't strong so keep an eye for the bartender haha... But overall, it's a decent spot to grab cheap food and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"They offered a $5 food menu for lunch and dinner! The background music is a bit too loud for my ears."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good portions, cheap price. In this day and age, it's rare to find all three in one restaurant.

Everything on the menu is 5 dollars and the portions are fairly filling. There were honestly so many things I wanted to order but just one was enough to fill me! It was pretty busy for an odd time on a weekday (5pm on a Thursday, yet there were still lots of people). 

Our waiter was really nice, she explained the menu to us even though it's not hard to understand but she was very friendly and service driven. She wasnt sure if the mac and cheese was still available, so she took our orders and the alternative ones, then went to check and happily informed us that it was. Sure this is common and protocol but I've come across so many servers that just clearly dont have the patience or friendliness to inform you (they just say it's not available and walk away even though the next table over has it). 

Food was good; the price made it all the better. They remember what you ask to leave out which is a winner in my books. The portions are filling for lunch but you probably want to order some appetizers for dinner. 

The only reason it's not a 5 star is because our table was kind of dirty and our server just put one of our coasters over it when she put the drinks down. 

But seriously, a fairly good joint to try with a nice casual atmosphere. Perfect for groups! And they have a live DJ."}
{"text":"This place has some really good music! And there's a real dj spinning in the back. So you're going to have a fun time dancing while waiting for your food and drinks! 

Also everything on the menu is $4.95. No matter what you want...all one price. Sounds like a win right?! 

Meh. 

I ordered the fish tacos added a side of guac and added a side of tortilla chips. Well, the good news is that you get three tacos. The bad news is that you literally get one of the tiniest pieces of fish spread across the three tacos. 
So it's mostly tortilla, corn salsa and lettuce. If that's your thing...cool but I could have used more meat! But whatever, for less than $5 it's good enough. 

Tip! Try to sit by the door when it's a nice day it makes for some great people watching!"}
{"text":"One word, \"cheap.\" If you are looking for a cheap meal, this is the place for you. Coming in here definitely has a very hipster vibe. Music is banging! If you're into the early days of hip hop such as myself. Seriously, Missy Elliot?! Say what?!

I would go here for a quick bite but more so for the vibe of the place. I had ordered one of the burgers and it was decent in taste and price. All under $7!  I will say one thing though, there bathrooms are ratchet. The bathroom floors are so dirty that I washed my shoes when I got home. I always say, \"the cleanliness of  any restaurants bathroom is a reflection of how clean the place really is.\" Because of this, my rating has gone down.

This place is good for affordable food and good music. But if you are looking for quality food and a sterile restaurant, this isn't for you."}
{"text":"This place has started becoming popular. There's usually a line up Wed - Fri after work.
What gives? $4.95 food menu is what gives!

This place offers pretty decent food all for $4.95. 

I shared with a friend the Hard Shell Taco (3 pcs) as well. This was just ok. I actually prefer Taco Bell better.

I had the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings and it was a big plate (1lb), juicy and tender. It reminded me of Earl's Wings which is pretty pricey.

In a hot day that we went, it was disappointing that there was no AC. I was sweating inside!
Service was good. Our server was attentive and food came pretty fast."}
{"text":"This was such a great find. Good music, cheap drinks and food? Amazing. I've been here quite a few times now. Mostly on Friday/Saturday nights and a couple of times for lunch during the weekdays. Also been to the one in the Annex. 
What I've learnt from going there at night is that there is always a line. Now..sometimes it is necessary because there is not a lot of room in there to move around/eat. But I found that a lot of the times it was just to make people think \"oh there's a line this place must be good\". There are many other businesses out there that do this. But I mean it's not like you walk in and it's dead. It's still busy. Best part I'd say is the music. It's pretty loud but not club-loud. And there's a music video on every screen for the song that is playing. Everyone including the staff are in such a good mood and jamming to the music as well. However, the food service isn't too great on these nights I find. My order is either messed up or just doesn't come at all. I'm usually too drunk to even realize though. 

During the day time it was busy when I went, especially on the patio. Music was playing lightly in the background, sun was out. It was a nice vibe. The food is pretty damn good for $4.95 a meal. But don't get the chicken soft tacos..no flavour whatsoever. I also think it's unecessary to pay for extra condiments such as KETCHUP when you're serving me fries!! But whatever..cheap food nonetheless can't complain that much. 

The only thing they really need to work on is the service. Bartenders seem to be on point but some of the servers need help,

Would recommend this place though to try out at least once for sure!"}
{"text":"Went with my mom and we asked for a quieter spot (since she is 70). Seated on the patio, 21 degrees and not too busy, we were really comfortable. The 5$ menu prices are unbelievable! We were happy with the selection and the service. The potato skins were great, abundant in cheese. My mom loved the soft tacos she ordered. My quesadillas were on the greasy side, but I still enjoyed them. I will definitely be back to try the Swiss mushroom burger and the nachos :D"}
{"text":"Cool place, but they'll offer add on's like double shots or hot sauce - all of which = $. Be prepared to say no to everything unless you really want that $1 sauce. People watching was at an all time high except for the PDA couple by the bar. 

Drink
I got the Classic Caesar $6.50 (delicious but got charged for the Warehouse Caesar $7.75)

Food
Onion rings (crispy but I wasn't a fan of the sweet sauce) 
Vegetable soft taco (taste was pretty bland and you basically have to break the top layer of the sauce to get at it but it was fairly filling)"}
{"text":"This was my first time going here, I had heard lots about it but never experienced it for myself. As soon as we got there we were seated and I loved the atmosphere. You can't beat the prices of the food, and the drinks were SO good. Is it weird I didn't want to leave? It felt like hanging out with a bunch of friends the whole time. Super friendly. Would recommend A++"}
{"text":"I think this is the ideal place for lunch. I've read reviews about their annex location and how they pressure you to buy alcohol to compensate for the low cost of food, but that's never happened to me here (but to be fair I've only visited for lunch). Another bonus about coming here for lunch is no lines! I walked past here for dinner before and I saw people lining up by the door. Never happened to me for lunch. Not to mention the fantastic portion size and quality of food. I've had a burger here and their soft tacos with beef on another occasion. I'm always impressed by the fact that I'm getting about $10-$13 worth of food based on the portion, quality and location of the restaurant but I'm only paying $5 for my meal. Ideal student destination I tell you.

Very few restaurants push me to the five stars mark but i think the restaurant deserves it for their quality of service. I have never been pressured to order more than I have to so my server can get more tip. My servers on the two times I visited were always super friendly, welcoming and helpful. On one occasion my friend's water bottle had leaked all over the floor and the waiter was super nice about telling us about it and mopping it up promptly. So basically, when I recount my experience at queen st warehouse, there was good food and good service for a fantastic price. Satisfies everything I can possibly ask for. As such, I can't help but give it a 5 stars for my experience."}
{"text":"I went to Queen St Warehouse on a Friday night and it was decent.  It is more for a younger crowd since the music is really loud. It was cool how the DJ mixed music videos (hip hop), my bf was into it.

My bf and I were really hungry so we decided to order 4 Items. 
Turkey sandwich on cranberry rye:   - 4/5
Potato skins 5/5
wings- 3.5/5
The works burgers: 3/5 

We never ordered drinks because we are cheap and they are a bit overpriced, but would go here again for $4.95 meals :)"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Dive bars can be quite fun from time to time and this place is no exception. 

The food options are quite substantial and definitely not bad for what you're getting at $4.95 - which is standard pricing for everything on their food menu.

There is also a fair list of options in terms of drinks at very reasonable prices. My go-to drink is their Warehouse Corona which is their take on a Mexican bulldog.

Waitresses were attentive and provide genuine recommendations when asked how one item compared with another.

They also have DJ at night where you can jam to everything from old school hip hop, rock all the way through today's top 40 hits!

The place is typically packed throughout the night so expect at least a 10-15 minute wait outside."}
{"text":"Inexpensive food. 
Loud atmosphere. 
Service does exist. 

A funny thing was I went to El warehouse on Bloor street west and many people talked about how bad their services were. I have to say I got lucky at El warehouse because I got an attentive waiter.  So I wanted to check how the Queen street warehouse is. Here we came!

Both places were not different in terms of atmosphere. It's loud and even louder in the evening and late night. For some reasons, I felt food here was better lol. How did I know that!? I didn't. I came to Queen street warehouse for eating and checking service and atmosphere, not drinking lol. But I went to El warehouse for drinking, eating and being crazy! I didn't care for food at that time. I only remember that the ranch veggie we added on chicken wings were smaller than the ones we did on Queen. 

Ok..let's see how the service was. Yes like many people said. Their service was good. I was ok with my server. She was friendly. Oh and I got my server's name this time ^^ Stephanie. 

We ordered 
- turkey sandwich and substituted Caesar salad instead of fries for an extra $1.95. The sandwich was good but it was small. Yes it was $4.95 that was why and everyone know that! However, we shouldn't have changed the fries to salad :( I didn't know it would cost $1.95. I didn't do my homework before eating lol. The server didn't mention how much it costs for an extra and I didn't ask for it. T_T I would rather order another salad dish next time.
- Penne with sun-dried tomatoes. Hey! I love this one. Simple but good! I had it with chicken wings Yum!
- Chicken wings. 6 wings yes! I counted it this time. I didn't count it when I had it at El furniture. We also added on veggie for $0.95. Fresh and good with chicken wings. Always wants it! 
- Guinness beer. Men love it. Right? 

We didn't order
- mojito. But I saw a bartender made it and I want it next time lol. Hopefully they are honest on making cocktails. Last time I got one at El warehouse but I didn't taste any alcohol as much as I should. I'm sensitive to alcohol. 1 oz can turn my yellow face into RED face lol

See you guys again!"}
{"text":"Decent place to go for lunch. The pulled chicken sandwich was fine and my friend enjoyed the quinoa and apple salad. Its not amazing fare by any stretch but probably one of the cheaper spots along this stretch of Queen Street 

Be warned, Beer is a dollar or two more than most places.  

 Service is a bit spotty but today was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place can be absolutely hectic. It mimics the el furniture warehouse on bloor n Spadina pretty closely but I'm pretty sure they're owned by same person. It's a nice interior layout which looks like the inside of a  ski lodge. You can't complain when ur getting solid food for 4.95. And this location has better food. They need a better system on turnover of  customers especially in winter bc the line outside bar is always long when u can see there's empty tables. I really like the music selection here good mix of oldies and top radio hits."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table, we were advised that there would be a 40 minute wait time for food but the food came faster than that. I loved my quinoa salad, it was a generous portion and tasted not bad. I also had the mushroom swiss burger but they gave me the wrong side dish. The music was really really insanely loud and had a hard time trying to talk to my friend. Also the lighting was kind of dark to see the food properly. Overall I wouldn't come back to this location as the excessive amount of noise kills it for me."}
{"text":"Heard about this place all over and always see the long lineups so I made it a mission to get there early for a taste test. 

The food here is a great variety with lots of quality dishes. I really like the braised beef spaghetti, the maple onion rings, the burgers, and wings. All great food and for the price, they're awesome! Can't complain. You'll definitely find something here that you'll like.

The atmosphere however is way too much for me. I know, Toronto, loud and expressive and they have a live DJ, but when the restaurant is packed with servers and customers that are conversing so loudly, the music is competing when I try to speak. It's hard to hear the servers and getting my order across. I think the music is a great element to the space, but it just needs to be lowered a bit. Be prepared for ringing ears after you leave. 

Overall, great food for the price and I love the concept of the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's crazy to think how far things have come since El Furniture Warehouse's west coast beginnings as a tiny, classic dive bar on Granville Street in Vancouver with floors covered in Jagger-soaked peanut shrapnel to its current incarnation as a super successful, Canada-wide chain of 'premium dive bars' staffed by Tattooed Tinas with lilac locks (and like, soooo many Instagram followers) and you sit at the bar at the Queen Street location and start calculating in your head whether or not it's appropriate to make googly eyes at the sun-kissed young man who's pouring your beergarita and is likely 10 years your junior but you can barely hear each other over the Bieber trap booming through the speakers so you might as well keep ordering your drinks with your eyes while your pheromones rage until you escort yourself home and immediately creep him on Instagram to continue your shame in private while realizing you should have ordered something from the $5 food menu because now you're really fucking drunk."}
{"text":"Really close to giving this place 4 stars.. but it's not quite there yet.

There was a huge line when we got there. Luckily, we were a group of 10 and they had the large round table available (in front of the DJ), so we got in right away. I knew food was $5 a plate before going but I am still in shock! I split nachos and mac & cheese with a friend. The nachos were good but they literally upcharge you for everything. $1 for extra sour cream, $1 for extra salsa, $2.25 for beef, $1 for extra cheese, etc..  so the price wasn't that impressive in the end. The mac and cheese was really good. It had a hint of spice.

The drinks were good and on the pricey side. But when you are spending so little on food, it's easy to justify spending more on drinks. My mojito double was around $12. The DJ played good music! However, it was so loud. It sounds like you are eating at a club. I could only really talk to the people next to me and had to shout to speak to people across the table. 

I really enjoyed the decor and the fact that they play music videos on the TVs - I don't have the chance to watch many these days! I would definitely return and try the patio."}
{"text":"For all the flak Queen St. Warehouse and its parent, El Furniture Warehouse, catch for poor service, I can't say I had a bad experience here at all. I came for dinner on the patio (note: the inside is extremely loud around dinnertime - since I have a quiet voice and am not heard ~60% of the time as it is, I figured there wasn't really a choice to be made here for me!). This is definitely not the kind of place I'd take my family to as the crowd is a bit young and rowdy. The food, however, is quite nice! I don't think the portion sizes were unreasonable at all for the low price - I've had the nachos for one, the corn queso dip (?) and the warehouse mac and cheese. The latter two were definitely winners, especially the dip - delectably creamy! The nachos for one weren't outstanding but they weren't bad at all (I just felt as if there wasn't enough cheese and I was left with a lot of sad corn chips at the end :( ) but in all fairness, I've paid three times the price for a plate of nachos of a similar quality / size so I have little to complain about. You can feed yourself well here, and for a great price! I was lucky to only have to wait about ten minutes to enter, but during peak hours it might be much more difficult - I would be cautious! Be aware also that although the price is fixed at $4.95 for food options, your waiter will likely up-sell you where possible by offering different add-ons to your dishes that you will be charged an extra ~$2ish for, depending on what you choose."}
{"text":"Came here at around 2am and couldn't pick what we wanted so we legit ordered 7 iteams!  All only 4.95 and honestly EVERYTHING was so good!!! Got tilapia, tacos, pizza rolls , shrimp taco, speghetti, pulled pork burger, 

We were served everything in less than 20 minutes and I was sooo impressed. 

enjoyed everything I tried , zero complaints !!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent but nothing you'd come running back to. Good place to have a drink and food. Thursday around 6pm it was busy but no line. 

Generally, SUPER SALTY food but totally made sense..to keep you drinking

Beers were also undersized for the price..they're about $7 for about a 1/2 to 3/4 pint. If you drink a few, you'll find your paying quite a bit more per ounce of beer. 

Where they charge less for food, you get gauged in beer 

Food was 5.95 per item (no more $5)

Best thing was the poutine, good portion with nice amount of cheese curds and gravy

Honey garlic wings were ok, sauce was like liquid sugar. Way too sweet. 

Works burger was ok. Burger was something you'd find at your local grocery store frozen aisle

Beef dip pretty good, bun was good, beef was very tender and moist, jus dip was INSANELY salty. If you order side salad, hold the dressing! They drench it (again, to get you to drink more!)

overall service was quite good. 

Would I go again? Maybe... Maybe not"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant multiple times and even though the drinks are quite pricey I still liked the restaurant's vibe and food. As a result, I decided to have my birthday on November 13th, 2015 here. I called beforehand to let them know that I'll be bringing 10 guests with me. They informed me that even though they don't take any reservations, they'll still keep in mind that a group of people will be coming at 10 pm on Friday night and try their best to accommodate us as fast as possible. When I asked how long the wait time will approximately be, the guy told me around 20 minutes which doesn't sound too bad. My friends and I arrived at 10 pm sharp. There were around 7-8 people ahead of us and it was a very cold night but we decided to wait anyhow. An hour and a half passed by and we were still not seated. Throughout the time we were standing in line, we took a couple pictures because it was my birthday but the bouncer or the guy at the door kept telling us to stop taking pictures and that we were blocking the way which we were not doing at all. And last time I checked, I was allowed to take pictures on the streets whenever I wanted. Not the best impression to get from someone who works there but finally, when we got to the front of the line after approximately an hour and a half of waiting, a group of 5-6 people appeared from nowhere and were let in. Everyone was shocked and no one could believe their eyes especially knowing that this restaurant, in particular, doesn't take any kind of reservations at all. Therefore, I went inside to find out what's happening and both of the guys standing in front of the doors told me that they the group who just went inside were with the owners and ignored my questions about how they were let in, in the most unprofessional manner and kept saying they were with the owners and ultimately left the conversation when I was talking and went away to serve other customers. Even though we were all agitated, we still waited another 15 minutes. Finally, the bouncer came outside and asked to check everyone's ID which he didn't do for anyone standing in line in front of us. Also, he didn't mention anything about checking ID's for more than an hour and half that we were standing in line. If we had known in advance, we wouldn't have spent our time standing in line for a restaurant with very poor customer service. Two of my friends were not legal at the time so he refused to let us in. No apologies whatsoever. This is the last thing he said to us, \"I cannot let you in, go eat somewhere else\". Never have I ever encountered such a rude and unprofessional customer service from someone working at a restaurant in my life. I called the restaurant to express my complaint to the manager at least 8 times but no one picked up the phone. The voice messaging system is also always full so you can't leave your name or phone number for them to call you back. Unless contacted by this restaurant and given an explanation about this whole issue, I will not be going back to Warehouse and would not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant either."}
{"text":"Yup! Exactly as reviews say - you get what you pay for - $5 plate is meh. My quinoa salad was drenched in dressing. Mac n cheese was blent and not cheesy at all, and warehouse Caesar was very very spicy and watered down."}
{"text":"The shots are watered down. And $7.00. I was there with friends and the shots of Jameson and fireball were pretty much clear. So no. Not okay."}
{"text":"Warehouse is a very hit or a miss place. Sometimes I have an amazing night but other times it's just whatever. It probably has a lot to do with the DJ; I've been around 7x and each time it was a different DJ.

The trap of warehouse is that they lure you in with cheap food (everything on the food menu is $6). The food is actually pretty good , I usually get the bbq burger. The trap is that drinks are expensive. Cocktails range from $7 to $13 and shots are $6 each. 

The trick to enjoying warehouse is coming in pretty drunk. This way you get cheap food while minimizing the amount of drinks you order.

The service I find is horrendous. I remember spending $100 on drinks/food just myself. But when I asked for an extra sour key (for my sour key drink) they said they'll charge me for it. In addition, they would always charge for extra sauce like bbq or chipotle sauce. I just think the place is too cheap and a money grab.

They are always trying to maximize their profits by churning people. Since their is usually a line up outside, they often start rushing people to leave often kicking people out who are done drinking/eating.

The crowd is good and the food is good. However, I just don't like how they are always trying to maximize their profits. It makes me very uncomfortable and ruins my experience quite significantly as they service deteriorates as soon as you stop ordering (aka providing them with money).

I've had some great nights at Warehouse but only when I've come drunk. When I'm sober trying to get drunk, that's when I realize how crappy the place is. Last time I came here I ordered lots of cocktails , all doubles. However I could instantly tell they weren't doubles because they weren't strong enough. After buying 7 doubles and my bill coming to $100, I still wasn't drunk. I know for sure my tolerance isn't withstanding the equivalent of 14 shots.

Again, the place is a money grab for drinks. Not is it relatively expensive, it is very stingy and sly. I tend to watch the bartender make my drink now because I don't trust them.

If you want to come here just for the food, then it's definitely worth it. If you come drunk and want to eat and get one or two drinks, then it's worth it too. 

If if you're trying to have a long night here like hanging out with friends for a few hours, then expect your bill to be relatively high."}
{"text":"$5.00 meals, and surprisingly, the portions are quite filling. The only thing is that the drink prices are quite pricey.

This is a good place to hang out with a group of friends, really fun and crazy loud atmosphere, and there's a DJ that plays every kind of music. Lol, including the Lion King theme song. 

It's really hard to get your servers attention though. I asked for a drink 3 times, but it never came. Two other servers I spoke to even reminded her but I guess she forgot? She did come with my bill though when I didn't even ask for it."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Visited on a Sunday around 4:45 pm, expecting a huge line. Luckily it was manageable (we were a group of 5) and even managed to get a spot outside on the patio after waiting around 10 minutes. We were told the wait for food was around 40 minutes, but that didn't matter much as we were looking for a sit down spot anyways. 

Ordered the mac and cheese, beef brisket spaghetti, and then split the poutine with a friend. All were alright but nothing spectacular. I liked the hint of spicy on the mac and cheese, but wish it had a bit more of a saucy base. The spaghetti was your regular tomato sauce style pasta dish. The poutine had a decent portion of bacon and cheese curds, and fries were not too salty. 

At 4.95 per dish, you get what you pay for - and probably more. The portions are pretty filling (one friend ordered 3 and was stuffed afterward) and the menu has a good range of items. If the line is manageable I would definitely return for some budget eats."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I, along with my boyfriend, ate here on a Sunday evening. I was surprised that the place was packed during this time. What I really liked was the ambiance and vibe, really catering to young adults (25-35) and great for first dates. The music that played was great, a playlist of awesome throwbacks that you can't help but dance to in your seat.

The food itself for the price was decent enough to enjoy. My boyfriend and I ordered the Smokey Burger that came with fries and the Crusty Mac n Cheese. The burger was nothing to praise about, it was pretty basic in my opinion. I could have made it at home myself. The Mac n Cheese with bacon on the other hand was great. The serving size was large enough to feed me and my boyfriend and of course to have sample tasting for my friends. Last but not certainly the least, the mini doughnuts with toffee dipping sauce was amazing! Just order it!

The downside was the limited space in seating that we had. Our tabled seemed to be the one of the largest and it did not comfortably fit us all. But would for sure would go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambiance, the music, the food! The crowd, it's so cozy and the food and drinks are amazing. It's cheap and the portion sizes are decent! xx we Had a Realy good time, and Will def. come back! Xoxo"}
{"text":"For $5, you get what you pay for - nothing gourmet, but still tasty. Their guac and chips, green apple quinoa salad with a side of braised beef and cheese-filled perogies are my favourite things to order. It's $4.95 for every food item and a good selection of beverages if you're feeling for it - this place can't be beat. My friends and I always come near the evening time to grab some appetizers or an inexpensive dinner. The cons however, is the busyness and loudness of the place. It is a dive bar/patio place, so expect the place to be loud (read: you may need to yell a little bit to be heard by your friends), and don't expect to have any deep conversation here because it is not the right environment for it. There is usually a line up almost all the time as this place is quite liked by people (either for the price or the items itself). Luckily, the last time my friends and I went, we went on a Tuesday evening before 9PM so we got there before the place was being filled for the night and forming an outdoor line."}
{"text":"We waited in a long line for a considerable amount of time while watching sketchy looking characters walk in and out yelling at each other.  People kept going inside and getting in front of us in line so we went inside only to be told to go back outside and wait.  

When we finally got a seat, it was so loud we could barely hear each other.  Ordering our food was an issue since we had to yell and point at the menu.  I get you might be attracted by the $5 menu but you need to be prepared for small portions and paying extra for condiments like vinegar.  Yes, they charged us $1 for a tiny cup of vinegar folks.  I have to say the food doesn't taste bad considering the low price tag - it's just that there isn't much of it.

It's really not a pleasant environment to relax and eat a meal unless you are lucky enough to sit on the patio when the blaring music isn't an issue.  I don't understand why the music needs to be unbearably loud. 

FYI they don't take debit but they have a machine in the restaurant.  No clue how much you'll be charged to use it."}
{"text":"I reallllllly enjoyed my Mushroom Swiss Burger!  It had premium Alberta beef, sautéed mushrooms, gravy, swiss cheese, macho sauce (what is macho sauce? Haha), shredded lettuce, and tomato on a toasted brioche bun.

Presentation looked great with a great big knife stabbed into the middle of the bun and the bowl of French onion soup next to it on the plate.

The toasted brioche bun was so shiny and soft and the premium Alberta beef was wedged between the two fluffy buns."}
{"text":"When the price was $4.95 the food was too good to be true. Now they raised their prices and cut down on the quality and portions of food. Everything just tastes horrible in there, don't waste your money no matter how appealing the low price might be. Staff are childish and unprofessional in there, throwing menus at each other across the restaurant, walking on the bar, swearing in front of customers. And the music is to loud even during the day."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate here looking for a place to sit and not break the bank.  Perfect for us, the waitress was nice and attentive.  The food, I had a burger and fries and she had the soft tacos, was better than expected. I had a couple of amber ale along with the meal at 6 each but both were tasty and still less than what I have been seeing around the downtown area.  The music was a bit loud but did not keep us from having a good conversation.  I would definitely eat here again.  

A line did form after we showed up, we didn't need to wait.  

They do not take debit but credit was fine. 

Good selection of items for the five dollar fare."}
{"text":"I was introduced to the El Furniture sister location up near Bloor and Brunswick a couple months back and I loved it.  This place is kind of the same with a similar setup.  

What's the same is the menu and whether it's dinner or lunch the menu and the wide variety that comes with it has the same prices too which is 5 bucks for menu items with the availability for a variety of add ons.

Now while the Queen and McCaul location is further away from U of T the vibe is very much the same because Queen W is just cool that way.  It's not the Annex, this hood has it's own thing going on.  

It can be quite loud inside.  The music or music videos, busyness and all around ambiance it's an eclectic crowd just like their music playing.  The two people I had lunch with had not heard of either the Warehouse or El Furniture but when I mentioned that we could have lunch for 5 bucks and that the food wasn't all bad they were all in.

To start all 3 of us had a starter, two of which were wings (one was dry salt and pepper and the other hot sauced) and the other was a basket of onion rings.  I mean the wings were small and there were about 8 for each.  For 5 bucks the wings is one of the smaller items you could probably order but hey wings are wings and they're good if you like that sort of thing.

The onion rings came with a side of what was referred to as Macho sauce.  It looked like a chipotle type dip not uncommonly seen as a side to onion rings.  The rings were thick cut and nicely battered and freshly made as they were steaming at first bite.

Each of us ordered the Works burger which is essentially a bacon cheese burger which includes a side of fries as well for the same price (5 bucks).  I mean it's not the most fascinating burger you'll ever have in your life but for a sit down place in the city 5 bucks is not a bad deal whatsoever.

The prices for pints are not outrageous either so considering I had two west coast IPA beers and two menu items after tax it came out to 27 bucks.  

Besides the affordable menu there's more to this place and why they have lineups down the street sometimes.  The place is simply fun and it won't cost you very much to enjoy it.

The service was better than good and the atmosphere is just plain cool."}
{"text":"I've been to Warehouse 4 times and I will definitely keep coming back. This place is awesome if you're looking for a casual environment to have a few drinks and cheap food with friends. Shooters and food are $5 and small drinks are $6.50 for the most part. I suggest getting the Blue Hawaiian or the Sour Key drink. For food I recommend the mac and cheese and the Union salad but everything comes in a huge portion and it tastes great!

The service is great and they really make you feel welcome and everyone is friendly. Keep in mind that there is almost always a line unless you go at times like 2:30 but it moves quick, especially now that the patio has opened up."}
{"text":"So y'all know I love El Furniture and by extension Warehouse. The food is great, esp for the price. For something that markets itself as a premium dive bar the service is pretty spot on too. I am especially pleased with the music selection at Warehouse. But last night I had my first taste of true disappoint with the place.

So we ordered water and other non-alcoholic drinks. They took 15 mins to get to us. Then we ordered the food. That took over half an hour to get to us. Was not overly enthused about our service. 

We asked to pay and I realized I had been charged extra for getting onion rings as my side (never having ordered them before I did not realize they were a substitution) AND charged for the dipping sauce (and I was not made aware by the server that these items had additional costs)!! I was pretty ticked off, not that it was more expensive but that she made the assumption we all knew that certain things had additional costs to them. Then there was a mistake when they separated the bills and then some miscommunication occurred and THEN there was a preset tip of 19%?!!! What? I'm pretty generous with my tips, even if it's not deserving service but I was super bummed about the whole thing and then seeing a preset of 19% was just insane. Not sure if this is a new thing they've put in, or just at this location because I don't recall seeing this at the other location. Maybe it's a ploy to make money off the obnoxious drunks that visit this location (many ear splitting whistles last night) but that's just ridiculous.

And to top it off, we were sort of hinted at to leave when the server came back later and took our water glasses away. Despite there being no one waiting to be seated. I sure it was just a ridiculously off night in terms of service but I thought I would mention it... Just in case it wasn't.

Btw, I have decided that the Mac n Cheese is the thing NOT to order here. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger last night and it was good but not as excellent as the Pulled Chicken!"}
{"text":"This could be one of my worst experience in my life. We lined up about 10 mins before getting a table. I was surprised and thought this could be a lot better than most comment. But here we go. We waited 1.5hr for a burger and a chicken waffle. We already complained other tables had come and gone before us and the waitress was putting out all kind of excuses like we were a 5 yr old kids. Anyway, food arrived, but she forgot the fries.... I will never come again. The one star is for fast table and food is cheap. That's only good about it."}
{"text":"Today I learned: you can't expect a lot from a place that serves meals for $5.

After awkwardly stumbling into the bar and trying to find a seat, my friend and I were escorted back outside of the bar by a host without explanation. He then pointed to the \"please wait to be seated sign\" and informed us there were no seats available at the time. (Flag number 1)

Just as we were about to leave, he signaled us back over saying a table had just freed up. At this point, we figured why not and reentered the bar.

Finally we thought - we had our menus, had our seats and the semi-rude (yet to be decided) host had left us alone.

Next, we were greeted by our overly bubbly and slightly aggressive waitress. Although she tried her best to name off literally the entire alphabet of cocktails and beers, she failed to realize that the music was too loud for us to hear anything she was saying. At first, her drink recital was endearing... but after roughly 30 minutes at the table, us ordering food, and attempting to make conversation, she had interrupted us over 5 times to suggest drinks.

(Disclaimer: I get it, Warehouse makes money off their alcohol.)

Finally, we ordered drinks. The drinks came, and one of our orders were wrong. (Flag number 2). Instead of trying to explain to the waitress what had happened, we decided to just accept the drink as is and continue our conversation.

30 minutes later. We've been interrupted another 5 times to push more alcohol. We ask for the cheque. The waitress explains that the machine is taking a while. She leaves us for 15 minutes.

FINALLY - we're out and the best part of all of this was, I ended up getting sick from the macaroni and cheese I had ordered.

In summary, despite the hype, the long line-up and the \"bangers\" in queue sometimes it's better to pay a little more than $5 for an experience. Oh and sometimes to best advised to lower your volume if you want your waitresses to explain drink deals or hosts to explain seating."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, attentive staff, and cheap food.  Great place to hang out and grab a drink, it's got a small patio area on the side.  Food is pretty cheap it's $5 for all items, but you get what you paid for.  The food quality isn't quite there.

I ordered the Beef Brisket Spaghetti, it was a nice size portion but lacking on the beef brisket.  Also had the Quinoa and Green Apple Salad, which was surprisingly awesome, something I would definitely recommend.  I'd come back for the drinks but not for the food."}
{"text":"Came with 4 girls and sat down at the bar for some late afternoon drinks and snacks. Immediately we were poured 4 Jameson shots to our surprise (except the one girl who had been before). Can't complain! But we were not exactly ready for such a shot haha.
It was a cool place with great music and they play the music videos on the tv which was a nice touch. We all got the Moscow mule and it was super refreshing. 
All food is $5 which was amazing. They had some really great sounding food options and I ordered some poutine. I didn't realize it came with bacon and I am a vegetarian so when it came out I must've looked concerned. Normally I would just pick around it, I just was caught off guard and the guy noticed and offered to have a new one made. I told him no no it was my mistake and it's totally cool but he insisted which was so nice. 
The staff was really nice and conversational. It was definitely a fun chill place to go!"}
{"text":"Went with two girlfriends this past Friday evening. The line qas long at 6.. People were coming out of the restaurant and you can see empty tables but nonody was being seated. Once inside, the food took a long time but it was cheap so whatever. We then noticed the table beside us left and has been left not dirty for 20 mins.. No wonder theres a huge line."}
{"text":"Loud music and chill environment. View of the CN tower and CTV building on the patio. Music blasting throughout the restaurant, a little quieter on the patio, but not by much.

Food was decent for the price. I mean, what do you expect for $5 a dish?! Drinks are up there though $12+.

Had the salt & pepper wings, spaghetti, fish taco and noodle salad. I would repeat all of it, except for the spaghetti. And the noodle salad can be a bit too salty tasting for some (I was fine with it).

The service was quick and attentive. But prepare to wait 20-30 at the door and 20-30min for food, which we were informed of before making it to our table. The heads up by the staff was much appreciated."}
{"text":"This place is always jam packed to the max! You most likely will be waiting for a seat. 

Now all dishes are 4.95! Can't go wrong with that price. The menu selection is alright. Some pretty good range in tastes. I tried the perogies for a starter. It was pretty tasty! The chicken tacos were alright as well for the entree. All in all the food was a little on the bland side but hey! 4.95!!! You can not go wrong with this price for food.

Just a heads up, the service isn't the best but what you going to do?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since I was in grade 10 (4~5 years ago). When I first started coming here, they allowed my friends and I to enter whenever we wanted during the day. That changed to 'people under 19 can't get in after 6:30pm', then it was 5:30. Last I've heard, people under 19 can't get in at all (haven't checked for myself though). 

We never ordered alcohol from there but the price of the drinks seemed to cover their costs to keep providing all dishes at $4.95. The price of food is definitely worth it. 

When you order food though, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for your food to come. Sometimes it gets so busy that they forget about your table. 

Some of the food is really good, like the Pulled Chicken Sandwich and the Works Burger. Some are very well above average, like the Union Street Noodle Salad, Chiang Mai Bowl, Tacos (any), Yam Fries, and Mini Donuts. And some are 'meh' at best, like the Nachos For One and the Chicken Caesar Wrap. 

Two big drawbacks for me are:
1. The long wait times, unless you go for lunch on a weekday. 
2. More often than not, servers will sit at your table while you're paying your bill. I understand that the establishment is very laid back, but there still needs to be some degree of professionalism. I feel as though they do it to guilt you into tipping more, which makes me only want to tip less. 

Overall, I'd still go back for the cheap food, if I had time to kill or just want a place to chill with friends."}
{"text":"Loves the service and food was amazing! This place has such character and everything yes everything the food menu is $5.   The drinks are also reasonably priced. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"$4.95 for food? I'm sold! 

But what I'm not sold on is the consistent bs that the warehouse group puts you through. I quit going to El Furniture Warehouse on Bloor because the food quality was going down the shitter. 

The food quality here is much better. I have no strife with that. The food was actually really good this time. 

The server was actually REALLY attentive and nice. She knew what she was doing. She was quick. She was amazing and friendly.

But back to the BS. There are SO many tables inside that AREN'T being used. The patio had maybe 3 tables sitting in. YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THEY COULD HAVE LET ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE LINE GO IN AND SIT.

I was super miffed because I was so hungry! And seeing the line made me want to leave sometimes when I was passing by other times. 

For me, this is a shitty business plan. If I am interested in dining in at a restaurant, I would look INSIDE the restaurant. If the restaurant is packed, then I know that it's good. And maybe then I would be willing to line up each time. 

But leaving your customers out in the cold while there are a bunch of seats inside? Absolute buffoonery."}
{"text":"This place was great, food for the price was so delicious and presented as if I were in a fine dining restaurant and not a dive bar.  The service was top notch.  The place was yamped when I came (mid-day/lunch Friday) - I waited a short while to seat, but it was worth it.  When I visit TO again, I'll remember this place."}
{"text":"This was a very cool place. Obviously, the food was only $5 but it was also a good portion. I had the sundries tomato penne and my friend had the Mac and cheese. We ended up trading because we like the other person's plate more. 
I would recommend both. The penne and an unexpected tanginess and I good amount of tomato sauce. The Mac and cheese was lovely. There was the creamy cheese and a little bit of crunch. I scraped the plate clean. They were both very worth it. 
However, the place was quite dark and we both had trouble seeing the menu. The music was also so loud were practically yelling at eat other.
I will definitely come again to try the rest of the menu. I should also check out El furniture but I think they have the exact same menu."}
{"text":"4 stars only because of the $5 menu items and because the food was pretty good but it's actually closer to a 3.5.

It was my first time there and I found it okay. They seated my group within a decent amount of time.The environment was loud and quite dimly lit Not a great place for large groups, but it would be nice for smaller groups. I liked the mix of music.

The service made me want to drown in my tears. Just kidding. It wasn't that bad. But it wasn't great, either. Teenagers probably could've done a better job then they did. You know the typical requirements to be a server? Out-going? Helpful? Happy? Our server was none of those. She was kind of emotionless. The food came out kind of slowly, and a bunch of different people brought our food to us. 

I ordered the Works Burger with fries (comes with your choice of either fries, a soup or a salad), and the fried apple pie (comes with vanilla icecream - which they should consider selling alone because what if you don't have the room for the apple pie but you have a second stomach for icecream?). I enjoyed both of them. Their portion sizes are great too! 

We paid for our bills individually, and could see that the server automatically put in a 20% tip, without disclosing it at all. Kind of rude, no? At least tell your customers in advance."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and a great selection of $4.95 shooters! They have those fancy drinks with an upside down corona bottle in it. It had a double shot of vodka with some kinda raspberry syrup. I actually stole the little plastic thing that secures the bottle against your glass. :) They were setting up for the MMVAs (Much Music Video Awards) across the street and I swear I heard Hedley practising 'lose control' like literally 13 times back to back. This place was playing old school music videos, which I thought was pretty cool. The girl to guy ratio here was about 5 to 1 which was great, because there is nothing worse then a sausage fest. The waitresses are also very beautiful and friendly. Great service. The only thing that sucks was the long line ups to get inside."}
{"text":"Is it FRAUD or DISCRIMINATION? I went there 2 weeks ago on a Saturday to celebrate my friend birthday. When the check came a 20% was on the receipt. I asked the waitress (RACHEL) if it was a common practice. She said that she does it as this is the rule. Should I mention that my friend and I are black....
She took the check back and give me a new one. So did she do it becaus we were black customers and she assumed that we were NOT going to tip her OR does she systematically do it to double her tips which it is a fraud? you are the judge."}
{"text":"Within the first 5 minutes of walking in to Queen St. Warehouse and being seated, I was ready to leave.  I don't remember when I became a 70-year old man, but I was uncomfortable with the loud music, odd seating arrangements (there were six of us cramped around a small and uneven wooden table), and overall hustle and bustle of the restaurant (on a Wednesday night no less).  One member of my party convinced the group to stay and I'm glad he did.

Yes the music is loud.  Yes, the tables are cramped.  Yes, the restaurant is busy.  But the food is $4.95, the portions are fair, and the quality was very good considering the low price tag.

For dinner, I ordered the pierogies and the chicken fingers and fries.  Both were well worth the $5 spent.  The pierogies were delightfully crispy on the outside, which is exactly how I like them cooked.  If I were to get them again I would skip adding the bacon (a surcharge of $1.25), which was barely noticeable and the pieces that were present were uncomfortably crispy.  The chicken finger dish featured three sizeable fingers and plum sauce, on a nest of peppered fries, definitely good value for the price.  For dessert, I couldn't resist ordering the mini doughnuts which were delightfully crispy on the outside, while still piping hot and soft on the inside.  Served with a small bowl of caramel sauce (that I am not ashamed to admit I licked clean once the doughnuts were no more), I would happily spent $4.95 on these again in the future.

Drinks are clearly where they make their money, but even those aren't especially overpriced compared to other bars in the area.  I enjoy restaurants that have creative cocktail menus, and I especially enjoyed my \"sour key\" drink, which tasted exactly like candy.  Be careful, because these go down smooth!

My favourite feature, however, was the option to add a \"meal for the homeless\" to your overall bill.  Clocking in at their standard $4.95, it is a great way to give back after an evening of indulgence.  Be sure to mention to your server that you are interested as they won't ask you directly if you want to do this.

Overall, we left comfortably full, a little bit buzzed, and pockets only slightly lighter than when we arrived.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"AmaZing food, I ordered the poutine and grilled cheese with cranberry sourdough!! The grilled cheese came with onion rings which were very crispy and delicious. However the poutine fries were a little over baked, but other than that it's a nice hipster and friendly restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Everything's super great but don't come here if you're in a rush because the food takes at least 40 minutes to an hour to arrive"}
{"text":"I came here with two others and we got a seat at the patio. Beware of the corner seat next to the street, it is right above the gutter, so it's not the most appetizing area to sit. Besides that the atmosphere was good.

FOOD: As advertised everything on the menu is around $5. The portion sizes are decent for that price. I had the macaroni and cheese. It wasn't the best mac and cheese I've had but I'll take it for $5 and it's a good portion. We also had some BBQ chicken wings appetizer to share which was good too.

DRINKS: Their drinks are unfortunately not $5, in fact no drinks are below $5. I had a Caesar for $6 and it was decent. 

SERVICE: Their service was great, nothing to complain about. They don't split the bill though, so be prepared to do some calculating.

In the end the bill came to around $15. So I would not consider this place to be \"cheap\" unless all you're going to order is the $5 meal and nothing else. If anything, I would order 2 meals if I'm hungry, and it would add up to a normal lunch price."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant/bar. I went here for the second time-- first time wasn't so bad. We get there, sit down, and I ask for hot water and lemon.Well of course, they don't have hot water... not even a kettle. Okay fine. I ask for Goat and Beets salad. The portion comes out and it's significantly smaller then the last time I ordered it (Not even for $4.95) and the lettuc is wilted, brown, and expired. I tell the waitress and she apologizes a few times, and informs that a new salad will be provided. The same exact salad comes back, with the same exact wilted, brown, expired lettuce, with even MORE wilted, expired, lettuce on top. The waitress told me that the kitchen staff said they have \"changed the size of the salads\" and that's basically how I get it. UHMM excuse me, you're going to add MORE expired lettuce ontop of the already expired lettuce. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I requested to speak to the manager, who comes to our tables with two shots (both in dirty glasses) and asks me the situation. He didn't bother to look at my lettuce and I told him he should. I explained, he apologized, and left. My friend and I were about to take a shot and of course, he glass had a fly in it. That was almost the last straw. At this point, the straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that they didn't bother to cover our bill or take care of us; apologized and give us a shot in a dirty glass with a fly in it? I won't be coming here and I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to come hear. STAY AWAY. Cheap is CHEAP and u clearly get what u pay for in this shit hole.

Oh yeah, and the first time I went, the girl beside me waited over an hour for their order. It turns out, they forgot their order. 

place is a joke and is run by incompetent kids. Clearly the owner doesn't give a shit, based on reviews, quality of food hasn't changed since the initial complaint lol.
 I won't be taking any L's for this, but I think the owner should recognize his L's and come correct. 

ps. kettles are 15$ at walmart...just saying."}
{"text":"The drinks at this location were 100% watered down. The shots of Jameson were clear. We asked the server for a new shot, a presumable bartender came over without saying a word, pouring a new shot from the bottle with a look of \"there b*tch, you happy?\" He then began to engage with us in a negative manner, not pouring from a new bottle, but telling us we were wrong. I asked for the manager because of his attitude, he said he was the manager. Jameson isn't supposed to be clear. My friend ordered a shot of fireball, the same thing. Being a heavy drinker, I know my alcohol! Everything was watered down."}
{"text":"PRICE IS VERY GOOD! Food is really good for the price and would highly recommend the mac and cheese! Also got BBQ crispy chicken wings and fish tacos but the chicken was kind of dry and the fish wasn't crispy enough. Still really good portions, like if I were to just order the mac and cheese, it would be enough to fill me up. 

Lol fun fact: everything we ordered were in odd numbers so it was kind of hard to share evenly (3 fish tacos and 9 chicken wings)

Also if you do go, expect a bit of wait time. We went at 1:30PM on a Thursday for lunch and had to wait for about 10-15 minutes, and there was still a line when we got out of the restaurant an hour later"}
{"text":"Apparently this place doesnt have security guards on friday nights and they really just dont give a fuck either. If you to order you have to across the the front of the bar for 15 mins, because its so packed you might as well be a sardine rather than a paying customer, until you find an empty spot to order a drink. In this process your likely to get shoved around... a lot. I did. Got shoved, then tripped over the person in front of causing an inch of my drink to spill on this guy. Now when i say inch i mean literally an inch which ended up on the bottom of his sweater. Ooooo big deal, but apparently is was. Even after I genuinely apologize and explained that i was pushed this bafoon he took his (full) drink and poured it down my head. Pissed and soaking wet I wanted this guy to learn you cant be an utter dbag and still have a good night. Having worked in the service industry before i knew exactly what to do to make this guy pay for what he had done... or so i thought. First things first, tell the security guard. Theres gotta be around 300 people in this tiny plplac, there has to be sercurity right? Wrong. No security what so ever. No wonder dbags are in full force knowing there will never be any reprocussions for their actions. After asking to speak with the manager and waiting for 15mins, still soaking wet, he said there is nothing really he can do. But here's a free shot of jagger. Now im a big girl having a drink spilled over my head for no reason sucks but at that point i realized it was a lost cause and i sucked it up took my free jagger shot and went back and re-joined my group. But nevertheless this dbag and dbags alike are still running free in this place and the fact that it couldve been worse then just a drink spilled on an innocent girl makes me sick that this place doesnt feel the need to get some security. Working in a bar before myself i know how essential that is not only for the safety of the non dbag customers but for the servers as well. My advice if you dont wanna wait an hour to get into a tiny over crowded where customer service seems to be their lowest priority ... avoid this place."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday around 5pm with a friend. There was approximately a 10 minute wait which wasn't too bad. 
The atmosphere of the place is really vibrant and lively. They played great music and had really nice lights around the place. 
The food was okay but nothing special. I had the tomato pesto penne and shared the queso dip with nachos with my friend. You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to the price. 
In my opinion, drinks were better than the food and are decently priced. I had a raspberry mojito for approx $9. 
Overall, the place is a fun place to go with a group of friends. I would come back but order something different on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat/drink in a dive bar atmosphere without having to go to the middle of a deserted country highway, then this place is for you. The main seating area inside is quite dark, loud, and cramped. However, the patio looked to be pretty spacious and seemed very calm in comparison to the ruckus inside. In retrospect, I definitely would've enjoyed the patio seating more; I thought that the bar area was super rowdy, especially considering it was 6:30 on a Monday. Girls were already doing push-ups on the bar top for drinks! 

Service was pretty decent...when we actually got it. I was actually having some issues flagging down a waitress since I wasn't able to tell them apart from some of the patrons. I think some sort of dress code/uniform would be good for the wait staff. 

Food wise, I can't complain since it is only $5 per dish. I thought that the portion sizes were fair, and the quality was decent. 

TLDR; rowdy atmosphere, ambiguous wait staff, ok food. Sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Waaaaahhhh... sad news everyone. The menu has price has changed to everything on the menu for $5.95 opposed to the previous $4.99."}
{"text":"This place is great for social celebrations and cheap meals! I've been here quite a few times and it's always a great experience. Avoid coming in groups of 5 or more (theres only 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate that many people)

PROS:
- $5 menu
- really good drinks (the sour key drinks tastes exactly like a sour key)
- right in the middle of downtown
- attentive wait staff

CONS:
- there is always a line-up to be seated
- food takes anywhere between 30-45 minutes
- small portions
- expensive drinks
- loud music
- does not take reservations"}
{"text":"Its just good to be able to have decent amount of meal for $5. service was quick and nice although I don't expect much for a budget dining. One thing to criticize is there are cracks on the table and I saw dirt was piling inside. Probably they should clean it and mend the cracks."}
{"text":"So I have gone here several times for drinks with friends and occasionally have ordered food that was pretty tasty.  Their drinks are very enjoyable and I would really look forward to them. 
One afternoon though at around 12:30, my friend and I decided to grab lunch quickly.  This visit did not end up being quick, we waited about 10 minutes outside and we could clearly see that only half the tables in the restaurant were busy.  We ended up sitting at the bar because there were \"no tables available\".  
We were not going to have drinks, we just wanted lunch so we ordered water, which took 10 minutes to arrive and the glasses were dirty.  The bartender seemed very annoyed that we were not ordering alcoholic drinks (which is why we wanted to sit at the table instead of the bar in the first place). But we ordered our food about 20 minutes after being seated and the food took 1.5 hours to come...for two lunches. One of us ordered the apple quinoa salad, and one of us order chicken strips and fries.  We started eating and it was not very great food but we did not want to complain and have to wait another hour so we ate, paid and left.  2 hours after we arrived...

I  ended up getting food poisoning from my meal...
I do not go there any more."}
{"text":"If you're looking with cheap decent eats with great drink selection you've come to the right place. I dined here with my friend last night for the second time and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, especially seeing as everything on the menu is $5. Unfortunately, we have mixed feelings about the service. Our first visit was great, they were extremely busy as usual so we asked to sit at the bar until a table opened up. We were enjoying the service of the bar staff so much that we decided to stay, although the hostess did ask us if we wanted to move to a table when once opened up which was great! However, last night our server was rather absent, although I do understand we were dining at a very busy time."}
{"text":"After having had this on my bookmarks list for quite a while, I've finally experienced Queen St. Warehouse's $4.95 menu. Perhaps I expected too much. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed.

We had the queso dip, the baja fish tacos, and the calamari. The queso dip is the only one of the three dishes I'd order again. The rest were fairly disappointing.

The queso dip came on a large plate and while the dip itself wasn't very large, there was certainly enough dip for all the bread and chips on the plate. I preferred the bread to the chips as the bread had butter or garlic or something on it that made it extra tasty, and it was warm/hot. 

I didn't have the calamari, but portion to price, this dish was totally off, even at $5. There were maybe six small balls I wouldn't have been able to identify as calamari. I'm pretty sure size-wise, the portion of pita on this place overwhelmed the portion of calamari. Bummer.

I don't order tacos much, but when I do, I'm expecting these gorgeously beautiful, colorful, Instagramable foods. These were not bad looking, but the amount of fish in these tacos was laughable. These tacos had less than one fish stick's worth of fish in each taco, and what fish there was was overly breaded. It was also quite dry. The tacos were tasty, but that's because shredded cabbage and mayo are delicious. I want fish tacos with a side of cabbage, not a cabbage taco with a sliver of fish. If the price doesn't allow for three good tacos, which is what was on the plate, make it two good tacos or something. Don't give me a bunch of filler stuff. Sigh. 

Service was pleasant, but when the servers weren't taking care of customers, they were goofing off rather loudly in the bar area or around the patio area where it was raining.

Even at $5/plate, I wouldn't call this a particularly cheap eat. I might come again, but I wouldn't be ordering most of these items."}
{"text":"Don't expect too much from this dive bar. The food prices are amazing with $5 items plus extras. It is a bit noisy inside but it has a nice patio which is always busy. 

The staff are not the typical downtown chain restaurants. If you have been there before, you would agree that they all have a unique style. Service can be a hit or miss but they do try their best. 

For the times I have been there, I ordered wings, chicken fingers, burger with mushrooms and the quinoa salad. I liked the salad and burger since it is good value.  In terms of drinks, it can be pricier to make up for the cheap food. There was no pressure to actually order a drink but with the patio seats, it makes it so much better on a nice Friday afternoon.

The place does not take reservations so get there early if you want the coveted patio seats.  Summer is here if only it stays warm."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at \"Queen Street Warehouse'. I had the 'braised beef deep au jus' with peppered fries, a 'three cheese dip' (starter) and a sapporo. 

Firstly, the food was delicious. It's important to remember the portions are small to moderate which brings me to my next point.

The portion sizes reflects the low ($$$) menu prices. Which is $5.95 for all menu items (minus alcohol and booze ).

Lastly, the atmosphere is awesome. Great place to visit for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, I went here more than 10 times and most time was pretty okay even it was not perfect experiences. But this time was worst. Our table was not cleaned up when server asked us to sit. Table was filled with bread/fries scrubs and some liquid so I asked our server to clean it up. She apologized and cleaned up right after, which is good. But they didn't prepare utensil to us even food got served and we were waiting until they come back while food is getting cold. Food was okay, not bad but not satisfied either. Then our good was having a plastic label inside when we ate about 70%, we asked our server to return it and told her we lost the appetite and want our bills too after she go and check with kitchen, then she grabbed the bowl and never came back. My table saw her taking orders in other two table beside us and serving other tables while waiting. Finally she came back and gave us bill but that's it. Bill was included the price of food that we returned to kitchen. Our server just left the table after she put bills on the table then left right away without any words, so we could not ask anything about what kitchen says about the plastic label inside our food. We waited 5 more minuets but she was chatting with other server m. When we tried to call her, she came with card reader. I asked her about what happened with our food with table on, then she told her that she will check with the kitchen and admit she didn't hear anything back. I was disappointed on her answer. When she came back, she told us worse answer which was they can't offer anything cause we almost finished that dish. I asked her again 'even with the plastic sticker on food?' , and she said they can't do anything for me. Me and my friend just made our payment with tip 15% cause I didn't want any trouble and I know server can't decide the discount or anything. But I regret the tip right away cause she just took a bill and card reader right away from our hand without one words like 'thanks' or 'sorry' for what happened. My worst experience at the restaurant ever. Not just because of food, because of service I got."}
{"text":"Still good. We tried the burgers. You can see that they were PC brand patties lol but tasty with the toppings .  I understand the cheap prices but odd about the suggested 20%+ tips.   I don't understand restaurants that don't pay their employees enough that makes patrons pay for their salaries ..."}
{"text":"4 stars (for the daytime.)
I have walked past here many times at night and never came in because there's always a huge lineup. Today I came at around 3pm, a not-so busy time. Had spaghetti (large portion) and pan bread on the side. Service was fast and food was good to ok! I was filled and satisfied, especially for the cheap price. I think this is a good place for students to catch a cheap lunch in the day. But I don't think this place is worth lining up for at night. 

Food 3/5
Ambience 5/5"}
{"text":"Looooong lines all day, everyday. That's the only downfall. But if you could put up with a 40 min-1 hour wait, the food selection is cheap, yummy, and totally worth it!

I came last night (Sunday) around 8PM for dinner and waited ~40 minutes. Tip: Come with a larger group and you might be able to be seated faster! The bouncer was calling for groups of 4-6 before groups of 2, so also consider sharing a table with another group of strangers to get in faster :)

Food- 5/5. All the food are only $4.95 all day, everyday!! And the portion sizes are actually much larger than I expected! We ordered 4 dishes because we were scared that the portions would be too small, but 1 salad or soft taco dish would've been enough for me. Lots of vegetarian options too! We ordered: 

1. Veggie burger + fries/onion rings/salad: Huge burger and very filling. Order this one dish and you'll be good all night. The veggie patty is pretty generic, but has good firm texture. The bun is just a regular white hamburger bun and pretty basic.
2. Vegetarian 3 soft tacos + guac and chips (extra $1.25): More like wraps than tacos. Filled with soggy and cheesy tasteless cooked veggies, uhhh mediocre... Probably the least impressive dish and I would not order it again.
3. Green apple and quinoa salad: Huge and very filling due to the almonds, avocado, and quinoa. I can't strongly recommend it though because it is sooo salty, way too much soy sauce. But otherwise a pretty healthy option.
4. Beet and goat cheese salad: Smaller and less filling than the quinoa salad since has no grains and is predominantly greens, but the big chunks of goat cheese and sweet pecan clusters are filling. The salad comes pre-dressed.

Value- 5/5. Huge portion sizes for how much you're paying.

Service- 5/5. Yes, you may be hating on all the staff by the 45 minute waiting mark, but step back and you'll appreciate how polite, caring, and fun the bar staff and bouncer are! They totally know that you and your crew are frustrated about the long line, yet they are still so patient with putting up with all the sass. So bottom line, remember that the bouncer is also trying his best to get you in ASAP, so be patient and gracious. The bar staff is super attentive, coming to check on us several times about the food and how we're doing, and refilling our waters without even being asked. 

Venue- 4/5. Patio seating is available and I highly recommend it if you want to hear your friends from across the table since inside is always very loud with music and chatter, almost like a nightclub even during the day. Inside there are booths and tables for large groups as well as bar seating. Again, super loud especially at night, so come for drinks and quick bites rather than first dates or full meals."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place and boy am I glad I did. There was a small wait of 10 minutes or so after work on a Monday evening. This place is usually pretty busy with short lineups. Everything on the food menu is $4.95 and they have amazingly generous portion sizes. I ordered the Mac N Cheese, The Works Burger and the Mini Donuts for dessert. I loved all the dishes and really great portion sizes. I simply love the Mac N Cheese, it was delicious with the bacon bites. The burger felt like your nice homey style burger which I simply loved. I also tried my friend's Quinoa Apple Salad and loved it. Great portion size for a salad at $5 and the dish was made with such a nice presentation. It tastes as good as it looks! Friendly staff, great young atmosphere, great food and cheap prices. Will definitely recommend to others and be a frequent customer here."}
{"text":"All their food dishes are only 5 dollars so I'd say it's a really good deal! Their food tastes great, however the service wasn't the best!"}
{"text":"They say time is money. I guess that's why everything is $5 here. You will spend most of your time here waiting in line or waiting for your food. 

My friends and I are broke college kids so this place was a given. There's always a line which takes 5-20 minutes. Not too bad I guess. 

For $5 the food is not bad. A burger + splitting nachos with a friend will fill you up and will only cost you $10 with tax and tip. If you want a drink it'll get pricey quick which is how I assume this place makes most of its money. 

The wait for the food is way too long. For just a couple burgers we waited for about 25 minutes. At least there was entertainment. You'll be able to see a few drunk hipsters awkwardly dancing to hip hop at their tables. 

Overall I have to give this place 3.5/5. With that price you really can't complain too much. If this was regularly priced at maybe $10-15 a meal then this place would be a 1 or 2/5 for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and left disappointed both times but last night would have to be the worst experience. Here are the issues:

- Toronto was under the a warning but the restaurant did not have A/C so everyone was sweating buckets

- The waitress took 15 mins to even come and ask us what we want to drink and what we would like to order. By this time i wish she had never come at all because she had a fucking chip on her shoulder 

- Appetizers came out in 5 mins...wonderful...undercooked pirogies...how do you fuck that up?

- Took another 15 mins to bring the drinks, which is when I was served warm beer...wait, aren't drinks supposed to come out before the appetizers? 

- Food took another 30 mins after to come out but not before going to the wrong table and having other people touch our food

- The food arrived at the right table, the order was incorrect anyway and had to be sent back. Asked for sauce on the side but instead received it drenched in sauce

- After another 10 mins, the food arrived (again) and it was clear why it cost $5 for each item. Burger still taste like freezer, the bun was squishy, they forgot the cheese (not sure how) and just sucked overall

Bottom line, I have no issue paying more and did not come to pay less but thought the place looked good.  My tip to the owners: charge more and serve people proper food. What you're serving is an embarrassment. Take some pride in your restaurant"}
{"text":"Ordered the Works burger, fish tacos, and chicken caesar wrap.

Works burger was decent. It tasted like a frozen supermarket burger, which is what you'd expect for just $4.95 (with fries!) Fries were a good portion and were nice and crispy.

The fish tacos (came with 3), although small, were very tasty! The breading on the fish was light and crispy. The coleslaw added a nice crunch. The tortillas were regular flour tortillas, not corn ones. 

The chicken ceaser wrap tasted pretty good and was a decent size. Very cheesy tasting. Came with a side as well. 

We came around 5:30 pm on Saturday. There was a short line to be seated which took about 20 minutes. Once seated, the service was prompt and friendly. The food came very quickly, in about 15-20 minutes. The server came by many times to check in on us and refill drinks. 

Overall, this place offers good food at unbeatable prices! 4 orders with tax and tip came to under $30. 

Note: The music is very loud to the point that you almost have to yell to hear one another. Might not be for everyone."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the price your paying. It's a great ambiance and sit down dining all for 4.95. I usually get the rose sauce penne pasta with a 2.95 add on of garlic and chicken... it's good and keeps me full for a while! Hope there's different selections at the new location."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Queen St. Warehouse fell short of our expectations. 

Food/Drinks - 4/5 (considering price & portion)
True, the El Furniture franchise is known for their cheap foods and pricey drinks. That being said, I would have expected their food to be at least comparable to their competitors. We ordered two of their brunch specials - the Breaky Burrito, and the Chorizo Hash. While both were decent in all fairness, and nothing was wrong with them per se, they were also a little underwhelming for food that was served after 40 minutes of wait. 

The drinks were a Hit or Miss. While the Caesar was delicious, the Brass Monkey (cocktail of beer and OJ,) was flat, watered down, and overall unimpressive. As mentioned before, the El Furniture franchise is known for their pricey drinks making up for the cheap foods. However, if the drinks are to command a certain price, they should be held to a certain standard. 

Service - 2/5 
Our experience with the service was not the best. Perhaps because the Service Charge was already included in by default, we found the waitress to be quite inattentive, as the wait time for each request was too long for us to appreciate. Interestingly, the staff who brought us the food (which was not our waitress,) was more attentive and willing to help. He was able to provide us more service and information in a timely manner than our own waitress. 


If you're just looking for something very affordable and filling (minus the service), you could consider this place."}
{"text":"Skipped into this bar on a Sunday afternoon thinking, how bad can it be? Considering all the food is $4.95, I wasn't expecting anything other-worldly. I was pleasantly surprised. The poutine was delicious. Bartending staff is really, really friendly. Definitely worth the wait if you happen to encounter a long line outside."}
{"text":"Omg lol such a bad place to go... horrible service, horrible food and drink, horrible clientele lol
Queen Street is full of amazing unique places to discover, forget about this one, doesn't worth a single star"}
{"text":"Cool little bar on Queen West.  Very cheap food and a nice patio. I'm not really sure what all the hype is about. The food is cheap yes but also very average. There's always a line out the door and the wait for food can be long.  I wouldn't recommend this place for the food but for drinks if the line is short for sure."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it sounds like. If you're looking for $5 quality meals, then that's what you're going to get. If you prefer taste over budget, then there's many better and tastier options in the area. Also, be careful when they offer add-on's because each add-on is an additional charge and its easy to turn a $5 pasta into $12. The highlight is the portion size, which is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is honestly really good for the price!! The veggie burger is a real one and the fries are really good. 
Good place for a cheap and good meal! 

Anyway, the service is not the best and the atmosphere is really loud (not cosy at all!). You feel like you're in a garage after a concert. Cleanliness of the place is less than average... But you come just for eating not spending much time. 
Enjoy the patio in summer!"}
{"text":"Queen st warehouse has the best prices you can get in downtown Toronto. For 5$, I ordered the beef hard shell tacos which came with three mildly spicy fresh tacos. The burger was so thick and even came with bacon! Also, $5 for about 8 wings=awesome! For $5, you really can't go wrong. Plus, the place is uniquely decorated with a antique / laid back vibe. Great place for a weekend lunch or a chill dinner before heading out. Service was prompt. Come early on weekends as this place will have a lineup."}
{"text":"When I came here around 1pm, of course there was a lineup. I was told it'd be a 45 minute wait, even though there were maybe ... 3 people ahead of me? I'm pretty sure that was a technique to shorten up the line and get rid of the weak ones. I only waited about 20 minutes before I was seated on the patio. Service was alright, not fast but it's understandable with how busy this place is. 

Although alot of the reviewers say portions are small, I ordered the quinoa salad and I thought it was a huge portion for just $5. I was fairly stuffed after finishing it but I assume this may be one of the few menu items that are well worth it. Because of how cheap the menu food items are, drinks are expensive. I don't mind paying $7 for a drink if food is going to be cheap, theres gotta be a trade-off right? I got the pink lemonade which I highly recommend! 

If I'm ever in the area and I see a small lineup, I would for sure come back. But I don't think its worth waiting more than 30 minutes to eat here; if ima eat, i gotta eat ASAP."}
{"text":"Most people on this stretch of Queen street believe food costs can be high. However with the closing of Everest restaurant,  el Warehouse has made a positive impact to the area.  All day price for all dishes are $4.95. . everyday!
The ambiance is a mixture of hipster, urban, gourmet and  dive all in one! Not to mention the layout of this place is great, lots of space both inside and outside with their lovely patio.
If you're a craft beer fan, they've got a good selection plus your usual beverages to compliment the various dishes they serve. 
I ordered their chicken wrapped tortilla served with salsa and sour cream! great presentation, portions and price! 4/5
My friend had their turkey club sandwich served with fries...again looked great and the portions were sufficient. 
Service was awesome, and everyone seems pretty chills.....I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There's always a line at the warehouse whenever I walk by Queen West. Now I understand why! All food items were only $5! Drinks were yummy too. Came here after work on a Friday night but luckily my coworker had her cousins already lining up so the wait wasn't too bad. The decor inside was very hipster and the DJ was playing some throwback hits. I ordered the works burger with yam fries and the mini donuts! The yam fries were delicious, but the mini donuts stole the spotlight. Hot and fresh with some cinnamon sugar and butterscotch dip? Perfection. I'll be back for lunch when there's less of a line!"}
{"text":"The truth is, I go to Queen St Warehouse for the music. It's always on point. If there was a dance floor at that place, people would never leave. The food is sub par (it's only $5 after all) - the quinoa salad and sweet potato fries were decent. The service is alright. And the beer prices seem relatively high since you're paying more for your beer than your grub. 

So keep your expectations low and enjoy the music - it's a guaranteed 3-star experience."}
{"text":"There is a patio.  All food is $4.95.  Done.

Just kidding!  I came here for a late lunch so t wasn't busy at all and I got a table outside on the patio.  Based on other reviewers this place gets packed later in the evenings, which obviously because of the price is no surprise.

There is a large menu selection of everything from salads, to tacos to burgers to pasta.  It's all $4.95.  But it's not $4.95 sized portions.  Decent sized portions.  I had the beet and goat cheese salad which was nicely dressed and had candied pecans and the yam fries which were hot and crispy. 

Can't go wrong with this place or the price.  I would recommend to hit this place up at off times if you aren't willing to stand in line"}
{"text":"Ok, let us start with yes, i would definitely come back here.

We came on a Friday night, after a day of skating, walking Queen West back and forth between Yonge and Bathurst, and after grabbing a bao at Bahn Mi. Well, I had a bao and some other stuff...but whatever, we were still hungry.

THE SERVERS ARE GODDAMN GORGEOUS!!!!!! These girls are just wow. So pleasant to look at. Kinda made me blush and such...but so pretty. I don't know anything about their intelligence, I think it's kind of weird that a lot of people are giving them a hard time because they...look good? Don'e be a hater. 

Drinks were normally priced, like any upper-scale than dive bar in Toronto (premium dive bar?). I think my pint of Sapporo was $7, big friggin woop that's how much I would pay anywhere...$5-7 seems reasonable.

We waited about 10 min for a table, it was crazy busy. Friday and all.

Ordered foodz:
- Mac and cheese - big portion, MEH. The cheese wasn't cheesy enough :(
- Chorizo dip - MY FAAAVORITE. Really good. Really chorizo-ey. Next time I go for this (I shared).
- Wings. I don't recommend...they're really really dry. And small. 
- Apple pie with ice cream - I didn't try this but it was huge and my friend really was a fan, so I will take his reaction and translate it into words because I don't do sweet stuff.

I saw a bunch of people get salads and burgers and they looks delicious, burger smelled delicious too and was surprisingly large and in charge.

I would give the food a 3/5. Eat somewhere else. But it's a good place to gab snacks and beers.

The one this I really didn't like is the music. Turn that sh*t down people I walked away with a buzzing in my ears. SO LOUD!!! 

Another thing that was hilarious is what's going on around the bar area. This is like a sitcom, no joke. The bar tends are beyond hipster... I'm talking like tank tops with sides cut out all the way to the belt of their pants, tattoos peaking out of every hole and cut. Amazing. Oh and hats, and beards! And they all dance and jump around and sing into the drink dispenser. It was entertaining to watch...like a hipster episode of Cheers, if Cheers was a musical. 

Anyway, it's worth a try. I wanna try more food, and I would definitely come back. Just turn down the music, a tiny bit. Please."}
{"text":"Do not dare not to order alcohol! 

I used to go to this bar for good hamburgers and beers, unfortunately one night I took my group of friends there and they all ordered burgers and cokes... that upset the waitress for not ordering alcohol which noted \"This is a bar!\". From that moment we received horrible service, threated as second class citizens, got an incorrect order and rolling eyes. 

I wanted to express my disappointment by giving a lower than usual tip but they added it automatically on the bill (Ontario's practice for parties). It's a pity the service is that bad, I really liked the food but I am not going back again."}
{"text":"Loud, noisy college kid bar complete with frat boy chanting..yet I loved it for two main reasons:

1) Food is SO GOOD - the Quinoa Apple Salad with Avocado is one of my new favourite things. A good portion for only $5?! Best deal ever. I also split an order of onion rings and despite what a previous reviewer said, we loved them. They were sweet and sticky and hit the spot just right.

2) Good Vibe - Yeah it's loud, but sometimes that's exactly what I want. I love that this place plays music videos on all their screens, some of which were total throwbacks to the 2000s that made my night. The vibe was youthful and party-like, just full of great energy and good service. 

However, when it comes to cocktails, SKIP THEM ENTIRELY! We tried three different ones and they all were disgusting and pricey--yes, this includes the margaritas. There is a total disconnect between the kitchen and the bartenders. Stick to beers and mixed drinks and you'll be fine. Don't drink anything that comes with a bottle or can dunked upside down in it. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"I came here with my super picky sister. I was surprised that she found something that she actually liked, which was surprising. Not only was the food good, but the price was only $5! So the food is good for what the price is, so don't expect any fancy flavours. However it was still awesome. Hopefully next time we can get a patio seat!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  They have a patio for nice weather days and the service is great.  Food is cheap and fantastic.  The crowd is friendly and easy going and the place has a great vibe.  Anything on the menu tastes fantastic and for $5.95 (every item) you can't go wrong.  You'd think the portion sizes would be super small, but they're not.  One order and it's enough to fill you.  It's a great way to save some cash and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Waited outside for like closed to 30mins(8c). Finally got a seat, and we only lasted maybe a minute and have to wave the waitress over to us and start shouting at her....because the music was so LOUD she can't hear me at all. I can understand if this is UNIUN. But I'm there to eat. Ended up sitting outside at the patio, luckily there was a huge heater on the side.
Yes, there was the $5 menu as advertised. But......just check out my photo and you be your own judge.
$2 for that glass of pop filled with half a glass of ice, burger with fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"What's not to like about $5 meals that actually tastes good and fills you up? 
I've been a fan of the one on Bloor, so the food is pretty much the same. The burgers are amazing, but my favourite is the quinoa salad.  It takes me forever to make it, so I'm glad there's a place that I can get a hearty bowl for just $5. 
Like I said, food here is essentially the same as the one on Bloor. But service is SO. MUCH. BETTER. I don't know what's it with el furniture, but thy seem to have a tendancy to hire servers that don't want to be there. Or at least that's my reprieve with the service I get at the Bloor location. And I've been there multiple times, an multiple people have served me yet the service is always a bit slower and the servers are never quite as attentive as you would like them to be, even when it's pretty dead. 

At Queen though, our server was always ready to fill up our glasses of water and was actually talkitivr and wanted to talk to us! She made me want to order more and actually stay there. 
Of course I'd go to both el furnitures again, but if I wanted to actually like the purple and servers there, I'd definitely come to Queen."}
{"text":"The food is great and price and all. I usually go to the one on bloor and decided to try this location out. The wait time to get in is pretty long so get there early. The ridiculous thing is the wait for the food. I ordered just sweet potato fries and it took 40 mins and counting. Still waiting for it."}
{"text":"Honestly, I walked in as soon as I saw the $4.75 sign outside, but ended up loving it! 
The DJ played the best throwback music (ex: Sean Kingston and old Rihanna) and all the workers seemed to love their job, which explained the great service. 

Only reason why I would not give 5 stars would be because of the quality of food? It's delicious and amazing for the price you pay but can't say that it was the best."}
{"text":"11/09/16

First off, I called this place 3 times to attempt a reservation and it no one answered. 

Lined up while watching people leave as they didn't have a very welcoming entrance. There was a bouncer(?) that checked everyone's IDs before allowing them to enter. 

Now here's the crazy part. After putting in our orders, we waited OVER AN HOUR for our food!!!! After asking twice for it, it finally came all at once. We had high expectations and we're unfortunately EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with the quality. They took an hour to cook some average food that I personally believe anyone can cook better. The fish tacos had a bite of fish in each taco. 

No one should be waiting in line and at the table for an hour for some average food and service. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Go somewhere else that is worth your time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so perfect to just sit outside for lunch, have a drink & people watch. 

The vibe is very relaxed, the food was cheap and tasted good & on top of that the customer service was very friendly so I can't complain.

I reccomnd the sun dried pene pasta!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to chill after work and this place was picked. I've been to the Bloor St location a few times but never this location. So why not, right? 

We arrived around 9pm on a Monday and this place was packed! We were seated immediately. Phew. Everything sounded smooth but why the heck only two stars? 

The food took forever to arrive. I ordered perogies and salt & pepper wings. The perogies were store bought, pan fried, served with sour cream with some spicy sauce. Bleh. Moving on, the wings. I mean it's pretty straight forward right? Nope. They managed to screw the wings up. Too salty and over fried. I had wings at the Bloor St location and it was executed perfectly. So 1.5 hours later we decided to leave and again it took forever for the bill to come. We literally waited 15 mins for the bill. 

Overall impression of this place? Meh. I wouldn't come back. I don't mind if I had to wait longer if the food was amazing. This place is just a nope for me. Also, the music was too fudging loud, it was impossible to chat with my friends and we had to yell. It almost felt like I'm in a night club. Yes I know that's their concept but it's just too loud. I could still talk and able to hear at the other location."}
{"text":"I always end up here for last minute drinks. It's in a convenient location and it's very lively inside! Great vibes and the food quality for $5 is great! Drinks are a bit pricier but still a good price!

If you are in the area and there's no line defiantly check it out!"}
{"text":"I Come here and the Bloor St location all the time and it's usually a lot of fun. The food isn't the best but what else would you expect for under 5$. I was in last night and the service was terrible. I couldn't believe how rude the girl serving us was. The first time she made a rude comment we all kinda laughed it off but she didn't stop until the whole table felt uncomfortable. I'm a really good tipper and it wasn't in me to leave her anything because of her terrible attitude. People like that should find a different job and not keep serving. It really sucks because this place actually gets really fun but I would never come back again."}
{"text":"I love my cheap lunches, and this one was definitely cheap.  

I don't know why this places gets such bad reviews.  It's a dive bar.  So I didn't expect much in terms of decor.

The menu had a variety of options.  I tried the baja fish tacos.  They were delicious, and for $5 you really can't beat it.  It was a perfect lunch size.  I added cheese, which cost a bit more.

I'm told (and have seen) crazy line ups for this place at night.  I'm not surprised due to the small size of the bar and the cheap food.  It was busy at lunch, but no wait to find a spot to sit.  

The default tip is 20% but the service was good and the food is so cheap, you can still get your meal under $10!"}
{"text":"This is the second location for \"El Furniture Warehouse\" which is located on Bloor St and this is actually my second trip to this location. This is a restaurant that everyone should pretty much know what they are getting into when they walk in, a bar style place with cheap/good food. Every food item on the menu is only $5, that's right $5 so anyone who complains that the quality might not match a $20 burger is kind of a moron. Today we came in around lunch time and as usual the place was pretty busy. Upon being seated the waitress took our order and was fast and friendly the entire visit. I ordered a turkey sandwich which had stuffing on it (which is a personal weakness) and it came was seasoned fries. The sandwich was good and so were the fries, well worth the whopping $5 it cost. Overall this is a fun place to stop at and with prices like these, I can't see this place ever failing."}
{"text":"Great place to \"chill\" with your friends. Amazing location, friendly staff, but the food takes a while to be served and that's understandable -- they have cocktails and some other drinks to enjoy while waiting for your food and while  catching with your friends. My fave cocktail is the sour key and just wanna add that their nachos is good for starters."}
{"text":"Decent cheap food however the service is VERY slow. Every time I've been here I have had to wait over 30 minutes for my food. Also, if you order fries you might want to ask for no pepper because they tend to go a little overboard. As for the drinks, they are quite overpriced but that is probably their main source of revenue. Overall, if you have lots of time to kill and you want cheap food, this is your place. If you're on your lunch break you will probably want to avoid!"}
{"text":"Don't even know where to begin with this review. First of all am i writing a review for a club or a restaurant? they had a bouncer who turned down families and groups of people who didn't have their ID's and all they wanted was food AND yet there was still a thirty minute long lineup to get to the door and the whole patio was EMPTY!? I couldn't even have a conversation with my friends without yelling and we weren't even in the restaurant yet. 

 We get seated to cramped dining, laughing that the table is not even going to hold all of our food. Our waitress who seemed stressed out got our drink orders and then ran off for another fifteen minutes until we could flag her down for our meal orders. After that POOF! She was better then Houdini himself i swear! No water refills, drink replacements, check-ups a \"can i get you guys anything?\" LOW OVERALL RESTAURANT STANDARDS. After waiting (i kid you not) an hour and fifteen minutes for our food that i could've whipped up in 30 minutes max. The worst part is, is that the food was all sub-par. Id wait however long for good food but yep you get what you pay for in a $5 dish, which in my mind is still not worth it. Last but not least is that of course she gets our order wrong (me forgetting) to mention they brought out an extra plate of beef spaghetti that got wasted for sure, so that being said she took an extra twenty minutes to sort out the bills. Phew! 

 In the end i just want to give people awareness that this restaurant is very poorly managed with long wait times for food that isn't even good. Save your time and money go somewhere else. Oh yea the table as predicted did not hold all of our food. 

P.s got there at 8:30pm left after 11pm
P.P.s i literally only got one small bite of fish per taco the rest lettuce and tomato, spaghetti tasted like it came out of a can. 
 The one positive thing i can say is their onion rings are pretty damn good and their wings too! but hell to the no will i come here just for onion rings and wings if it takes three hours."}
{"text":"The menu here is surprising considering everything is $5! You have burgers (with a side!), sandwiches, wings, salads. The thing that really surprised me with Queen St warehouse is that they don't skimp out on the portions regardless of the cheap price! All the meals are regular sized and for the average person one dish may be sufficient (for me however, no). 

My favourites:
- Turkey sandwich on cranberry bread: delicious. Lighter tasting. Seasoned well and even comes with fries or salad!
- Goat cheese salad: this one surprised me. The amount of arugula in this baffles me since arugula salad is quite pricey at the supermarket.
- Burger and fries: can't ever go wrong with this combo

Don't recommend:
- chicken waffle sandwich: I believe this is a brunch special only but this one is a tiny portion and they charge extra for the maple syrup.
- fish tacos: this one wasn't that great because the fish in it was so small and I felt like it needed more in it (still fine for $5 though)"}
{"text":"The food here is ridiculously cheap. Everything is $5!

The bathrooms are clean, the layout is cool and flows well. The staff are friendly.

Stopped by for drinks at the end of a late shift and wasn't let down. 

Not much else I can say about it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to eat here at approximately 5:45 on a Tuesday.  The lineup was long-ish - it extended to the western edge of the adjacent patio - but moved quickly; we were seated within about 15 or 20 minutes.  The food is great . . . . for the price.  I think we would have been disappointed had we paid much more, however.

The service was excellent; very attentive.  Our food did take a little while to arrive, which was fine in this case because we hadn't hit the \"hangry\" stage.

Word of warning . . . if you were born before 1990, be prepared to feel old.  This is definitely a hot spot for university/college students!"}
{"text":"Good food and good small café/bar, but WAY too loud ... the music is played as loud as a night club which makes speaking with anyone crazy. The crowd is mostly under 30 and the place is packed."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Downtown Toronto, it's a sister club to the one we have here in Vancouver. 

We had such a great time here !
It was packed on Boxing Day and it was a fun crowd.

They played mostly videos from the 80's with some newer stuff thrown in.

Service was quick and attentive. 

The bathrooms were clean, bright and big enough you could bring a friend in with you. 

I defiantly would go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with cheap food!! Recommend the chaing mai bowl with the chicken, the sauce for it was really good. I also recommend the onion rings, they were the bomb dot com. The atmosphere was pretty cool and I really liked the music they were playing - all throwback tracks. The burger patty's were definitely not made in the kitchen, seemed like it was store bought - but alright tasting. Didn't understand why the tip % was automatically 20% though, weird."}
{"text":"The worst customer service experience I've had in a dog's age.

Got a round-robin email from my company that they would do takeout if we mentioned the company name (even though it's supposed to be sit-down only) for an extra $2, apparently to replace the cost of the beverage you'd be consuming if you dined in? Who knows.

The hostess OK'd it with another staff member, both perfectly nice, and suggested we sit at the bar to wait.

A few minutes later, a guy comes over to ask if my coworker and I have been helped, I say we're waiting for takeout. He says \"we don't do takeout,\" so I explain it was OK'd by other staff. He turns on the attitude as if the miscommunication is our fault to explain that he's the owner and rudely says he'll do it this one time but in the future they don't do takeout and threw in a totally random name-drop for good measure.

Would've been fine, had he left it there. Came over 10 minutes later to ask us to move and wait by the door when there were still seats around. I apologized for the confusion and again, he super rudely replies \"it's fine,\" even though it was his mistake and if anything, he should have apologized at the very least. 

Then he sent over one of his staff members to collect the $2 surcharge mentioned in the email \"for takeout\" (thought you didn't do takeout?) after we'd already paid. We paid with no complaint and then they said they'd \"waive\" it. 

All in all, we waited almost an hour for the food, one order had clearly been sitting because it was soggy and cold without the sauce that was supposed to come with it. No napkins or cutlery.

Had the owner apologized or even just not been a jerk, I probably would've been back. Definitely will not return and you've lost a ton of potential customers from my company for an email your resto clearly initiated, whether you realize it or not.

I've got better things to do on my brief lunch break than invent a takeout e-mail, bud. I'll pay $2 less for a better meal and at least half-decent treatment at Subway next time."}
{"text":"I've never been robbed before- but I have been tonight! The servers and waiters here WILL inflate your bill!! I was our having a few drinks with freinds for new years, I had a few pints and my bill came out to be $600! That was literally impossible, unless their beer has gold flakes in that I must not noticed. This is one of those places where the will add a bunch or purchases to your bill- make sure you go over everything on your receipt first!! They will inflate your bill if they think they can get away with it!

Not a bad space, but watch out for the employees- they will add items to your bill if they think you aren't paying attention... honestly not trustworthy, I'd rather not deal to with this sort of nonsense when I'm having having 2-3 pints with friends.

I know this is sort of standard practice for many establishments in Toronto, but it's still pretty low..."}
{"text":"El Furniture Warehouse serves cheap and greasy food at the expense of terrible service. If you've ever wondered how a stray dog is treated then El Furniture is the place to go. The waitresses are dressed in scantily clad clothing and within the first two minutes upon entering the restaurant you will notice that the restaurant's patrons are probably more pleasant to talk to than the waitresses.

Food -3/5: the food is decent/not great, but for $5 you cant expect too much. The burgers we ordered were obviously from Costco, as it had the same texture, look and taste. The mac and cheese was only good after adding about $5 worth of add-ons. Overall i would only go here again if I wanted to have a variety of mediocre foods.

Service - 2/5: waitresses were swearing all the time, made inappropriate comments and/or remarks and failed to fulfill simple requests (such as when asked for a glass of water). I also saw waitress sitting/eating/flirting with a patron for over 5 min where originally I thought she was his friend. I guess this is just the vibe or culture of the warehouse.

Price - 4/5: $5 for everything on the menu is good, but upon receiving the items it is obvious how they have come to the price. I think there was as much effort used to make the dishes as an 8 year old opening a can of Chef Boyardee and microwaving it. However, there are some select items on the menu that are actually worth the $5 and do not require add-ons to make them bearable.

Good prices, mediocre food, and bad service. You cant win em all folks"}
{"text":"I had a very nice experience at The Warehouse. There was a bit of a wait outside, maybe 15 mins or so, which wasn't bad at all. The food is cheap and tastes good, and the atmosphere is very inviting. The service was actually very good considering that there was a line to get in the whole time I was there. I feel like everything was very swift, but I didn't feel rushed. The server was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu, which in turn helped me to make my decision. I ended up getting the Chang Mai Bowl and the bacon potato skins, which were both portioned perfectly. I would definitely go back again as it's probably the best bang for your buck in terms of restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Loooove this place! I was in town from San Francisco to see my family for the holidays and one night I came in with my brother in law and the music was 90s old school awesomeness. The DJ and the unpretentious crowd was great.Who doesn't love TLC, Notorious BIG and Will Smith?! They have a legit $4.95 food menu and their beer selection is great. We had a blast! I'm sure this place will be THE dive bar to go to soon enough."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Extremely long wait times for food. Not so bad wait times for seating. Good portions. Friendly staff. LLBO.

Whenever I'm feeling cheap or looking for a place to grab a cheap bite that's not McDonald's, I find myself at warehouse. Their menu is pretty good, a number of starters, burgers, bowls and desserts. Everything is 4.95; you can also have some add ons for an additional 1.95. So technically a three course meal here would only cost you a minimum of $15. Not bad if you ask me. They also have a drinks menu although everything there costs more than the actual food items. 

It's super loud inside so getting a patio seat is worth the extra wait if you're looking to have a meaningful chat with a friend or colleague.

I got the mac and cheese, no add-ons. It was a bit dry honestly and the pasta was a bit undercooked. My friend got a BBQ burger and we shared a plate of honey garlic wings. We both agreed the wings tasted like they were pre-cooked, re-heated wings that you could find the frozen aisle of your grocery market. The sauce was way too gelatinous."}
{"text":"Lacklustre fare and a terrible atmosphere make this newcomer a hipster student dive at best. Blaring music, bland food, and horrible service. The prices are decent, but this is a textbook case of both \"you get what you pay for\" and \"style over substance\". 

Belongs in a college town somewhere in Guelph and not on the main drag of Toronto's hippest neighbourhood. Thankfully, like Everest before, likely not long for this world."}
{"text":"Love this place, great place! Atmosphere is 10/10, food/price is 10/10, drinks 10/10. I always come back with my friends. The Mac and cheese is one of my favourite dishes here!"}
{"text":"This is honestly a really chill with a cool ambiance place to go. All the food is here is 5.95 with some adds on that would cost $1-2 dollar extra. Example of this is their fish tacos- you can get guacamole or cheese for an extra $1-2 dollar. Portion sizes are smaller but it's great if you order a few dishes to share among friends. In terms of service, people are very nice however food took around 20-30 minutes for it to come out. So a tad slow. However, for the price that you pay in this great location I would go again ! :)"}
{"text":"Always come here with my boyfriend and I always get the Mac and cheese and another dish with it whenever I'm hungry. Food is good for the price but they will ask you things that you might think is free but when you get the bill they charge for all these add ons... though you may not even wanted it or mistakenly thought it was included they will never tell you that they will be charging you. Not right."}
{"text":"Food is really good for the price! You get a good sized portion. You won't have any leftovers to take home but the portions are definitely big enough to fill you up. My favourite is the turkey sandwich on cranberry bread. The waitresses are very friendly, although they do push drinks on you pretty hard sometimes.

I would recommend stopping by in the afternoon/morning when it's quieter. At night there are long lineups even if there are cleared tables inside, and the music is loud enough for you to have to shout. Be prepared for an onslaught of mid-2000s R&B at uncomfortable volume.

Been here lots of times and I'm always pretty pleased with the experience aside from the lineups - not cool when I can clearly see clean, empty tables inside and I'm freezing my ass off outside because \"no seats are available\"."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight with a small group for drinks and snacks. We went around 7:30-8pm and didn't have to wait for a table but noticed it got busier as the night went on. I tried the tacos which were a little skimpy on the fish and plain but okay and the Calimari which was just okay as well. I tried one of their warehouse favourites (pink warehouse) where they have a corona shoved into the drink which was enjoyable to drink and equally tasty. Service was very attentive throughout the evening. 

Don't come here for amazing food but it's a fun place to get cheap eats and drinks!"}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto, this would be my go-to spot. I think it's everyone's go-to spot because there is always a line during daytime, nighttime, weekdays, and weekends. I happened to walk by this place and saw the sign that EVERYTHING on the menu is $4.95. I ordered the Chicken Kale Caesar salad which I enjoyed very much. Sunday is R&B Sunday and they were playing really good music. I came back Thursday night with other tourists, and the place was crowded. Walked by Friday night, still crowded. Always good music playing. The staff are really nice here. They lose one star for having slow service. Took like 20 minutes to get my meal which wasn't a complicated meal that required long cooking time. Do try to take part in their pay it forward program they have. Since everything in the menu is the same price, you can leave any extra $5, paying for a meal in advance for a homeless person."}
{"text":"No wifi, very disappointed. The food is however good priced and drinks are fine. The music is very good. Atmosphere is lit."}
{"text":"This us a great chill spot the music and vibes are good playing r&b and contemporary music, the food is only $4.95 for anything! But the food is good not great"}
{"text":"My kinda dive bar. Good music, cheap food, cheap beer.

All food is 5$ with decent portions with reasonable add-ons. I had the fish taco's, was not disappointed.

The drink special was a pink lemonade with a coronity in it for around 12$, which is a pretty good value in terms of alcohol/$.

The DJ was on FIRE, mixing 90's hits with current bangers. The line can be HUGE at times, but if you manage to get in totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! This is the ultimate summer night spot. 

$4.99 meals all day long?? I was really amazed and I still find it hard to believe. I love the menu (although quite small), I always have a hard time deciding on what to get. I'll always pick the Baja fish tacos, it's my personal fave. Pro tip: order The Sour Key! (Not sure if that's the exact name of the drink but it's amaaaaazing)

I've been here on a Friday night and I have to say the food quality is slightly worse if you came on a day that's less busy. The pasta my boyfriend got was cold when it got to us and the wings tasted like they came out of a microwave. I also had to wait 25 min in line to get in that day and the food took a little long to come. Safe to say that I won't likely come on a Friday for a while. 

The atmosphere is great though, it's a lot of fun with the music and friendly servers. It gets pretty loud indoors so I always opt for the cute patio. You also get a nice view of the CN tower in the back of Queen St. 

Overall for the atmosphere, price and quality of food I would say that it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"MAX 1.5 stars out of 5.0.

Table of 5, Sunday night @ 8:30PM

Plot Summary:
-20 min wait in line up, 
-yet oddly restaurant was 1/3 empty (immediately we knew service wasn't going to be great)
-we knew to order food immediately, but after taking drink orders, the waitress ran off 
-after food was finally ordered, we were basically forgotten 
-about 1 hour in, we kindly reminded the waitress that our food had not come (she had only checked on us about one time prior)
-10-15 minutes later, our food had finally arrived, before we could cancel our orders and leave (roughly 75 mins after we ordered)

Food ordered:
-1 x Onion Rings (Good)
-1 x Quesa Nacho Chips (Average)
-2 x Beef Spaghetti (Sub-Par)
-1 x Quinoa Salad (Good)
-1 x Caesar Salad (Average)
-1 x Wings (Average)
-1 x Fish Tacos (Sub-Par)
-1 x Hard-Shell Tacos (Sub-Par)
-1 x Chicken Tortilla/Wraps (Sub-Par)

We figured it was $5 food, so average, if not sub-average might have been the norm here.  However, a waitress brought out an order of hard-shell tacos, that were filled significantly more than the one we had ordered and immediately we knew ours was probably thrown together quickly due to the hour wait.

When the food was served, one extra order of spaghetti was brought to us.  We advised that we had only ordered 2,  The server seemed blame our waitress as if it was her mistake and they just brought it back to the kitchen.  I have no idea what they were going to do with it.  

A table beside us that was seated maybe 10 minutes after we had arrived, only received their orders as we were finishing up ours.  It appears it was not just us that had to endure this over-1-hour wait time.

The worst part was that no explanation was offered to us when we had asked about it.  Nothing was done to even attempt to resolve the situation - not that we were begging for a free spaghetti (which they may have thrown out, if it wasn't actually for another table) or a deep discount, but I would have thought maybe some sort of rectification for their ultra-slow service would have been in order.  

Maybe we were just unreasonable to think food should be served within the hour.  

The server was a sweet girl and we don't blame her for the slow kitchen, but there was probably a little more she could have done to help make up for her teammates.  Ditching us for an hour was probably not the greatest idea.

For the amount of food we had to order, it adds up and really isn't a whole lot different than going to a restaurant chain like Moxies and ordering a meal and some drinks.

During the line up, there were 2 girls in front of us who decided to bail on waiting.  We left Warehouse wishing we had left and gone to eat wherever they had gone."}
{"text":"I had to try this place because of the $4.95 menu and I was suprised it was actually good. I would definitely go back. Highlights are cheap food! Chicken wings, poutine, mac n cheese - all good. Chicken fingers, burgers (the patty), and donuts are meh. The servers are nice and pretty attentive. Be forewarned, it is very loud in here but I enjoy their music selection. There's typically a line outside and it's understandable; if you go in smaller groups, it's easier and quicker to get a table."}
{"text":"I heard this place was good from someone. The service is terrible honestly for the price this place is not worth it. I can get better tasting food for even cheaper than this place we ordered braised beef spaghetti which is oily crap and fish tacos small piece of crap I don't why this place is so packed"}
{"text":"This is where you go for a good time, drinks, cheap food but plenty of it! Locals favourite! All staff 'keep it real' and seem to be always having fun as well. Not a 'family place' but definitely one I go to from time to time to meet people or catch up with friends for a drink or three. Loud music and typically a line up to get in."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! I got the Quinoa & Green Apple salad, and it was AMAZING. I've been to this location multiple times and have tried different things on the menu, but the best thing out of everything I've tried is that Green Apple salad. 

The 3-stars rating, however, is for the wait time. I was downton for Canadian Music Week as media and had some time in-between shows to eat some lunch. My videographer suggested Queen St. Warehouse. Our order of my salad and my videographer's chicken wrap took 45-50mins. We were a bit annoyed that it took that long and we saw the waitresses huddled around the kitchen window just chatting with each other. I would definitely suggest that they hire more help for the kitchen staff to lessen the wait time."}
{"text":"Drinks were delicious and the food was good, but the service is VERY slow ( it can get pretty busy in the evening ). 

Best Drinks were: 
SummerSixteen
Pink Warehouse
Crazy Canuck 
Raspberry Mojito 
Keyrona 

As for shots, we tried the Lemon Drop and the Pickleback, both were really good! 

They food is pretty well priced ( $5.95 for everything ) but the portions are   also pretty small, and understandably so. 
I've tried the Chicken Tacos which were okkk and the Nachos for One, which were really tasty. 

Some other dishes at our table were the Grilled Cheese, Chicken Caesar Wrap,  Veggie Tacos, and the Baja Fish Tacos and they looked really tasty. I'll definitely have to try them out next time.  

Note: They will charge you $1 if you ask for hot sauce. If you're with a large group, I HIGHLY suggest you all order your food at the same time, because if some of you can't decide what to order, and ask your server to come back, your food will arrive soooo much later."}
{"text":"There's no other place on queen west I've being too so far that has this high of a bang-for-your-buck value. The honey garlic wings was substantial considering it's only five dollars! The wings are decent sized and cover in lots of yummy sauce, so that every bit was very enjoyable. Not the huge wings that tastes bland like some chain restaurants offer.

There's always a huge line up outside and around the corners every time I pass by but I never knew what people were lining up for. Now I finally understand! 

We came on a extreme cold alert weekday at 4pm and were the second in line. Considering it's really loud inside and my friend and I could barely hear each other while shouting to each other in the face, I will never line up for this place again. But if anytime we do pass by and there's no line up, then it's definitely worth while visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and actually ended up coming back around 3 times during Pan Am weekend. I really like the service here from the beautiful waitresses and cool bartenders. Drinks are a little pricey but that is to make up for the $4.95 food menu which isn't bad. I highly recommend the honey garlic and hot sauce wings. Not to mention that the music is great with 90's hip-hop which is what I grew up to! This place is good for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"We stayed in line in front of restaurant for more than 1:30mins. We saw several people came,just gave some money to the security and went inside.in was totally unfair,bc it was freaky cold outside and we just needed a table in a way normal place! Come on manager! Watch out your crew!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this bar/resto was probably the worst dinning experience I have ever had.  I have heard lots of good things about this place, so I am hoping I'm just an outlier.  

There was a line up to get in, which is to be expected for the area.  Once we were seated we waited about 15 minutes to even get menus. The music was also so loud we couldn't hear each other talk.  Which I understand some people may enjoy but it was a bit too loud for a dinner hour, in my opinion.  

There was an unusually long waiting time to get our food, once we ordered, as well.  When we got our food, my friend wasn't given utensils for his salad...so we had to wait to eat the food. The worst part of this whole experience was the chicken soft taco I ordered.  Half of the ingredients listed on the menu weren't in it and the chicken was so dry it was essentially jerky.  

The only pros I can give this place is the food price at 4.99 for everything and aside from the overly loud music, the bar atmosphere was lively."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very lucky to come across this gem! Luckily it started to rain heavily while walking around downtown Toronto so we decided to run into this bar (what a coincidence right?!)

Queen St Warehouse ended up being a gold mine! They have this menu deal where anything that's on the menu (food) is $4.95 CAD. It's a pretty lengthy list of meals and the portion sizes are enough to fill you up! They have everything from small appetizers (fries, tapas, etc) to burgers and sandwiches. They even have a good amount of vegetarian meals that without a doubt can be converted to vegan. 

As for the alcohol it's a full sized bar with everything from basic cocktails to their own creations and of course a good amount of beers on tap. 

The bartenders here are also very alert and are constantly checking up on you (we sat at the bar); they also provided a lot of recommendations for people that aren't from the area. Sadly I don't remember the name of the bartender we had but he had a beard and longish hair (wish I caught his name!)"}
{"text":"The vibe in this restaurant is full of life and as someone who frequents Toronto often I always find myself back here. In fact- I'll update this review as I plan to return this coming weekend.

The food is insanely affordable, bartenders are rad and fun and the atmosphere is always inviting even though crowded. The location is a perfect spot on Queen St as well."}
{"text":"*For $5, you aren't going to get gourmet meals here, but taste and portion wise were pretty good. 
*The atmosphere isn't what really my thing, since it can get really loud at night, almost like a nightclub. 
*Service is pretty bad, you can't differentiate who are the servers sometimes since the way they dress pretty much blend in with the crow

-Braised Beef Spaghetti (Fresh herbs, tomato marinara, hint of cream + slow cook beef) - $5:
All the dishes came out piping hot and initially I thought the dishes weren't going to be great, however it was surprisingly tasty, and the portion was pretty decent! The pasta wasn't al dente, but not mushy either so it was okay. Sauce was delicious and seasoned just right, and there were chunks of braised beef throughout the spaghetti.

-Warehouse Crispy Mac n' Cheese (creamy 3 cheese, roasted red pepper Alfredo sauce, crunchy corn, fresh thyme + Parmesan crust) - $5
C got the Mac n' cheese and she said it was just a typical dish. I didn't try it since I don't like mac n' cheese lol.

-Mini Donut - $5: 
C and I also ordered the mini donuts for dessert, which tasted like timbits from Tim Hortons haha. The dessert came with a chocolate dipping sauce and there was no fillings inside the donuts, overall it was really sweet so personally I didn't enjoy it, however it is a great bar snack imo."}
{"text":"Dropped by the warehouse on a Sunday afternoon at about 3pm. It wasn't too packed and we got seated relatively quickly. As you know, everything on the menu is $5. We ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, brisket spaghetti and a side of honey garlic wings. 
The burger was very average. The patty is definitely from a presidents choice frozen pack and the salad that came with it was drenched in some brown dressing. 
The spaghetti was also very average, little meat and luke warm.
The wings were half decent. Roughly 8 small sized wings with some celery and carrot sticks. 
The bill came up to $17ish and we left pretty satisfied.
The price and quantity makes up for the poor-average quality of the food. 
But then again, it's $5 each plate. If you came in expecting good good food, you're very mistaken. 

Overall, would come back for a quick bite and bang for your buck to fill your grumbling tummy."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch at the Queen Street Warehouse today.

It's been open for about a year and there's always a line-up outside.

All the food on the menu is $4.95 and there's a lot to choose from ... burgers/fries, wings, salads, tacos, mac 'n cheese, etc.  I ordered the works burger and fries, minus the cheddar, onions and lettuce.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much for $4.95 ... but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was really good!  The burger has some nice spices and was juicy and tender.  I was expecting a slider but it was a normal size burger.  The fries were good too.  It'd get it again.

Lana was my server.  She was friendly and despite it being so busy, she took good care of me."}
{"text":"I don't have many complaints mainly due to the cheap prices and convenient location. Everything is $4.95 with the drinks being priced higher, probably to make up for the cheaper food. Service was average but the seating was horrible. Some tables have barstools which, by itself is already annoying enough to have a seat with no backing. This annoyance is exacerbated by the fact there are no places to put your coat or bag aside from the floor! I don't know if the owners realize this is Toronto and we're pretty much walking around with parkas til April. 

We ordered: 
* mac and cheese - probably my favourite dish of the night
* kale salad - just average, would not order again
* the works burger - super salty, the patty was worse than one from Mcdonalds, would not order again 

The food menu and drinks menu are both pretty extensive so there are lots of things to try. As long as the food is around $5, I'd definitely come back repeatedly."}
{"text":"I've gone here about five or six times in the past couple of months and I've had a pretty consistent experience. The servers generally do a good job but I've noticed that they are sometimes unattentive or take a while to fill up waters.

In terms of the food it has been pretty hit or miss but I would definitely recommend to stick to their \"favourites\" items like the works burger or the soft tacos. Those are the items with the little lightning bolt, get one of those and you wont be dosappointed.

Also if you get the fries a heads up that they have an insane amount of pepper so caveat emptor.

Feel free to shoot me a message before going and I cam give you a recommendation on plenty of the menu items as between myself and my friends I've tried nearly all of them

Also be wary of the conditions inside it gets really hot and really loud so you may want to request sitting outside."}
{"text":"Walked past this beautiful place, line out the door, well worth the wait. Kay was our server and she was an absolute gem. We ordered the Ruby Tuesday and Pink Lemonade for drinks (sweet but delicious). And food, Mac n cheese, Quinoa and green apple, and Beet and goat cheese salad. Everything was amazing and $5.95. The coolest concept and the dopest place around to hang out, listen to great music and extremely beautiful/kind staff."}
{"text":"I'm glad they opened one up here so that i dont have to venture all the way up to Bloor!

This is a great place to chill and drink with your friends. Atmosphere was super lively even on a Thursday night. I had to wait a good 20 mins to be seated at 8pm. Probably not the best place for a date though since it's a bit too loud to carry a real conversation.

All food items are prices $5, drinks are not a fixed price. I expected small portions but for five bucks, they give you a good bang for your buck! I got a burger that comes with a side (fries, soul, or salad), all together for $5. IMO, this id cheaper than a Mcdonald's combo.. The burger is obviously way better, and fries are thick cut. 

I'd definitely come back again for drinks and the food!"}
{"text":"I'm trying real hard to understand why this place has 3 stars? Like forreal, why? You cannot beat tasty, cheap food. And typically, you don't get both. Food is either cheap, but not tasty. Or tasty, but not cheap. But Warehouse is doing it right.

We went on a Saturday afternoon so it was a little packed. We had a bit of a wait to get in, but it wasn't crazy. Maybe 5 or 7 minutes, tops? The ambiance is pretty laid back, or it would be if the music was blaring. The loud music is the only reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5. We could barely hear each other speak so be prepared for a lot of \"huh?\" and \"WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\" throughout your meal. 

Loud music aside, can we talk about the food tho? 

Its pretty clear they get most of their cashflow from drinks, and those were reasonably priced too (or maybe I feel that way because I'm from Chicago). We ordered 2 drinks, burgers, and mac & cheese. Weird combination, I know, but my girlfriend really wanted that damned mac & cheese, only for her to not finish it and have me eat the rest because she got that full. 

I got the Works burger. Thinking back to it, I was not a fan of the sauce on the burger. But it wasn't a big deal.

We'll be returning for the food, because who needs eardrums when you can have a delicious $5 burger?"}
{"text":"Pros: All their food is $5. Nice patio. Great location. 

Cons: Even when its not that busy they form a line outside for no reason."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and all at a great price point (5.95)!! The drinks could've been stronger though--it felt as though I was drinking juice. After four drinks, I was still sober, and I'm no heavyweight. The service was pretty slow which is another reason why I'm giving warehouse four stars. However, if you're in Toronto, you gotta try this place out! It is worth it and has a great view of the CN tower."}
{"text":"Food wise this place was I would say was okay , we only had apps like the sweet potatoes fries and the soft tacos. And it was nothing to special just your average regular flavours... I would say good idea to eat before drinking , the place gets packed and there's a DJ plays top hits and  everyone starts dancing :) even on the bar !!! It was a great time with friend/coworkers. I would not recommend for couples, or intimate settings .. Well at least for the time I went which was Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Great food for a cheap price, and attentive servers too. Only downside is the occasional wait time."}
{"text":"There must be some food conspiracy when their menus are all $5 each and the portion is not tiny. tho their drinks are pricy but the food is only $5!!! and that's why this place is always jam packed! but quality of the food is not bad. I had some quinoa salad and wrap my friend had works Burger both great."}
{"text":"Great vibes, great food and I had an amazing time. Their music is a bit too loud so it's very hard to hear the other person so it might not be a nice place to call in for a ladies night or friends to hangout and talk. Their drinks r great too and the best part is u get it under 6$"}
{"text":"My friend suggested we go to this place to grab a bite after work. She said it had good food and it was also cheap. So I figured, why not?

I got there a little before 5 and there was already a lineup! Thankfully my friend got there before I did and secured us a table. The atmosphere is very casual with dimmed lights and very (and I must emphasize the very) loud music. 

She was right, the food was definitely cheap with everything on the food menu costing 4.95$ and the drink prices also being quite reasonable. I decided to go for the BBQ chicken sandwich with a poutine upgrade for 1.95$ and a pink lemonade. 

Honestly, you get what you pay for. At some point I wasn't really sure what I was eating, as the chicken was likely smothered in the sauce with some other toppings. I was hungry though, so I ate that sandwich and didn't look back. I will say though that for that price, I wasn't expecting a full-sized sandwich so that was pleasantly unexpected. The upgrade to the poutine was definitely not worth the 2$ though. The fries weren't anything special and there was barely any gravy or cheese. My friend had the fish tacos and said they tasted better and had more fish the last time she was there. My drink was the highlight of the meal. I don't think it had any effect on me to be honest, but it tasted nice and was fizzy!

Overall, the prices for the food are ridiculously cheap, but expect the quality of the food to be what you paid for. The service was adequate, but it was the sheer loudness of the music that was too much to handle. I think this is a great spot if you're living/surviving the student life or just really wanna grab something quick to eat that isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, cheap food. Their brunch is surprisingly delicious and not only is the food better than the Vancouver location, but the staff is much much friendlier. You cannot beat a $5 sit down meal."}
{"text":"Average food but for $5 it makes for a pretty good deal! Love the atmosphere. There's usually a line to get in so get there early! 

We got the works burger which was probably the best as it was juicy and savoury. The perogies were decent but average. Make sure to ketchup it! The potato skins were overcooked so wouldn't recommend it. The soft shell chicken tacos were decent but boring. 

Overall a great place to grab a bite for $5. Perfect portion for one! Would definitely go for a quick bite if in the area and save money!

Staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Terrible service; always a long line-up and when you finally get seated it takes forever to see a server, let alone get the food you ordered. It is over hyped and prolongs your outing experience due to waiting inside and outside the bar."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
Located on Queen Street West and University Avenue. You know you're at the right place once you see an absurdly long lineup outside this restaurant on Queen Street. 

[SERVICE] - 3.5/5
Standard procedure was to wait in cue for a long time, but once we finally got a seat, the servers were extremely welcoming and personable. Drinks came almost immediately after we ordered them, but the food took quite a long time to arrive because it was so busy.

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Noise-level: loud (do not go there with your soft-spoken friends). Very cool dive-bar, and they blasted some really fun music (90's and early 2000's throwbacks). 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
Every single item on the menu is the same price! Each dish was $4.95, but the price increased to $5.95 recently (in the beginning of 2018). The food is so good, and definitely worth that price! 

[ORDER] - 5/5
I've been to this place countless times, and my goal is to try the entire menu! So far, my favourite items are: 

- Baja Fish Tacos: fish was juicy and deep-fried until it was crispy on the outside, toppings were fresh, and sauces complemented the tacos very well

- Crispy Calamari: deep-fried very well, portion was not very big, but of course still worth that price tag

- Works Burger: the patty was tender and garnishes were delicious. Sometimes, the bun can be stale but when done right, the bun is perfectly warm and toasty.

- Warehouse Crispy Mac n' Cheese: hearty, cheesy, and SO comforting.

- Mini Donuts: they perfected those donuts! They're perfectly sweetened with sugar dust, and the toffee espresso dip is heavenly! 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
I love this place because of the one-price-for-all concept! Even though the price went up by $1 since last year, I will still come back to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to the El Furny on Bloor many times before, and while I love it there, I much prefer this location! 

The patio is perfect for drinks and lunch with friends. They have a great selection of drinks. I absolutely love their sour key cocktail! The crazy Canuck is really good too. 

Yes, the severs are dressed inappropriately , but when everything is 4.95 you can't go wrong for the delicious food and generous portions!"}
{"text":"A go-to spot for me whenever I'm feeling frugal and need a solid meal.

I'd give it five stars but one star gets deducted because it does take a while to get seated and food takes quite a long time.

Other than that, great atmosphere, good music (most of the time..), and food is quite the bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I generally like the other location better. Both I find very packed, but if you really want a bang for your buck, and an adequate amount of food, I would defiantly come here. They have an all day food menu of $5. 

My favourites: perogies, mac and cheese, and their burgers. If I had to choose, I would order the mac and cheese for sure!!! 

Be prepared to wait a little bit in line, because this location is in the heart of the city. Environment is for young adults, with mainstream music and throw back hits playing in the background. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"dropped in on a wednesday night. we were quickly given a table for two right opposite the bar. loved the atmosphere of this place! im a sucker for christmas lights in bars it makes everything glow and look so mysterious. they played old school hip hop/rnb on the tvs which were entertaining to watch-almost forgot about nelly's band-aid phase lmao YOU DO YOU NELLY

service was great even though it was a packed bar. we didnt get food (stuffed our faces at bahn mi boys) but the people next to us ordered mac'n cheese which looked awesome. not to mention every food item was 5 bucks or less.

tattoos and xo hoodies were everywhere and at some point someone let out a tribal cry. cant ask for more on queen st."}
{"text":"Decent tasting food at good portions. Service is often a hit or a miss: sometimes super fast and friendly, at other instances completely forgetting an order for half an hour. There's a dive bar vibe but at $5 a dish, no complaints here.

You can't go wrong with the starred menu items. 
- The Works Burger: the best dish there - tasty, filling with a good helping of fries
- Mac and Cheese: a guilty fav more so out of nostalgia than quality. The portion is not enough on its own

Standard place good for quick, cheap meals if you're lucky but not worth the long queues"}
{"text":"Friends wanted to go here for a girls night, the weather was nice so we decided to sit outside on the patio. There was a line up when we got there on a Friday night. Around a 20 minute wait. The food is cheap $5 menu, don't expect much. The food is very basic but it's a good for the price you pay."}
{"text":"They advertise $5 everyday items, and if you get take out it would be great. I've been here a couple of times now, and despite the cheap eats, I can't say much for the service, other than it being super slow and they charge a ridiculous 18% gratuity for 5+ people. Seating was a mess, since they pack larger groups into smaller tables. Food service was generally slow, ranging from 30-40 minutes before anything hit the table, which is not ideal during weekday lunch service. The food is decent, if you're willing to wait. They will ask you if you want to add things, pretty much for every item on the menu, which defeats the $5 meal. The chicken quesadilla was  a decently sized portion. The salads were a hit. The nachos for one were a big disappointment, despite paying extra for more cheese, there was arguable no extra cheese.

This may be a good place for some causal drinking and cheap eats, but leave your expectations at the door."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday afternoon and there was already a mini line-up. We waited about 15 mins before someone from the restaurant came out to check on the number of parties. As we didn't mind where to be seated, we got bumped up to the line. 

We ordered drinks and food. We waited and waited and waited, almost 15-20 mins after still no food arrived. Now, we understand that it was a busy Sat afternoon, but it became a concern if people got seated after us had their food before us. We did not order something crazy as it was only potato skin, the Union Street Noodle Salad, and a beef soft taco. The food were mediocre. The noodle salad consisted of egg noodles, with Spring Mixed greens on top and some chicken bits. The dressing was SALTY! It was supposed to be tamarind- soy sauce dressing, but all I could taste was soy sauce. I tried to eat the noodles together with the veggie and chicken, hoping that it would help with the saltiness but unfortunately the chicken bits were also salty and very overcooked. 

When we asked for the bill, that was not pleasant. We were told to give her 2 mins to clear out nearby tables and she would bring our bill, but that 2 mins turned to another 10-15 mins. We saw our waitress dancing and chit chatting with others near a computer. When our bill was finally here, she rounded up the changes without asking as I was paying cash. 

Overall, I will definitely not come back to this location even with their $6 menu."}
{"text":"You can't get worse in Toronto! This place is a cesspool and I would not waste my time here. The staff only care about letting their friends skip the line and have ZERO respect or common decency to regular customers."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch. I cannot believe there is a resturant that will serve a $5 meal for everything. And the that price, the food was actually pretty good. I got the waffle and chicken. The chicken was crispy and hot. The waffle was freshly made. Combine together with maple syrup is one awasome $5 dish. Remember, review should be adjusted according to price. This place serve good food for a cheap price. Well done."}
{"text":"When I meet up my friends and decide to go eat, we would usually go here. I like to try a lot of the things in the menu and I love how consistent the price is for all the food. My favorite things to eat here are the hamburgers and the sweet potato fries, YUM!

Also, the salad that they have for the side with the burgers is simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing place went there yesterday for the first time, service was great, food was amazing. Olivia was the best waitress ever, she was very attentive"}
{"text":"My girl friend and I came by to check this place out due to their $5 menu deal. It was A-OK... We came here on a weekday around dinner time and there was a line up outside. Wait time was about 20-30mins, so it wasn't too bad.

We ordered the Mac n' Cheese, a spaghetti, poutine and alcoholic beverages. I gotta say, for 5 bucks the portion it came in was decent. However, the taste not so much. It tasted like microwave dinner food... perhaps, we didn't order the \"right\" items on the menu? Other than that, as many yelpers have noted, service is quite slow. It took awhile for our server to come take our order and for our food to hit the table. On top of that, our food did not come hot. It was just warm. I'm pretty sure they waited for all the dishes to be heated up until serving them to us because all our dishes were served all at once... 

If you plan on having a conversation here then forget it! Even if you try to shout at the top of you lungs, the music volume level here will just mask your voice. My girl friend and I had to repeat ourselves several times and even then, we had to read each other's lips and play the guessing game... We quickly finished our food, packed the rest and dashed out of here.

Would I visit again? Probably... unlikely, but if I do again, I'll definitely be grabbing a seat at the patio."}
{"text":"So I came just after work one day and it was completely packed. I could not imagine how early everyone else must have gotten there but it was filled with a young hipster crowd. I frequently see a line at this place but didn't try it out until a friend suggested it. Everything on their menu is $5 - I was super skeptical because how good can $5 food be? I was pleasantly surprised that they had a fairly extensive menu with a lot of variety. We got the apple quinoa salad, nachos, and mini donuts. I thought everything was decent and was pleasantly surprised - I've had a lot worse for $5 in this city. Side note: the extra toppings we added to the nachos cost more than the nachos. We left before 7 and there was a huge line waiting to get in. Come early for cheap drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"Cheap eats for $4.95 on Queen St. West! While service and ambience was great (we sat inside, and the windows opened out to Queen St.), don't expect much in terms of food quality. I ordered the braised beef dip au jus with fries (all sandwich items come with soup, salad or fries). Although the deep fried onions were a nice touch, they weren't crunchy and either the braised beef or baguette tasted frozen. The fries were also on the soggy side and were covered in pepper. My friend ordered the braised beef spaghetti - it was a good portion size considering it was also $4.95. There were braised beef throughout the spaghetti and one additional chunk of beef. I probably wouldn't go back to the Warehouse for food - maybe if I only had $5 on me...LOL!"}
{"text":"Who can give a bad review for a place that charges less than a big mac combo ?!?!?

The place is completely packed all the time. I was lucky enough to catch them at a good time to sneak into a spot before the place got full.

They're not BSing you. ALL THE FOOD IS $5!!!!

Quinoa salad is definitely my favourite along with their bacon mac and cheese...YUM YUM YUM."}
{"text":"I've been to the Bloor/Bathurst location and had no problem even with how busy it was on a Saturday. We got a table shortly after 10-15 minutes and our server was friendly. I was really excited to finally check out this new location on Queen...

So, my friend was booking a party in behalf of her coworkers to celebrate a new job so she thought she would give it a shot to make a reservation. She e-mailed Sean Young who is one of the upper ranked managers for both locations. Surprisingly, he said he could accommodate the reservation for 15 people at 5:30. They had been e-mailing back and forth with confirmation. The day came of when we were going to go there, a group of almost 20 young professionals, most of who were checking out El Furnitire/Queen St Warehouse for the first time...NO reservation written down. As you can imagine, I can't quite elaborate even more than what is already obvious. From the secure feeling of booking a reservation through one of the head managers of the place to looking completely helpless upon arrival is just out of this world. 

Way to make a great first impression to the entire group."}
{"text":"I've been to the Annex location 3x and never had a problem.  Last night, after leaving the AGO for First Thursday, i took a friend visiting from Montreal to the El Furniture Queen st. because I knew they would be open late.  There were at least 5-7 empty tables and we waited to be seated, as per the sign.  We waited, and waited.  Finally, my friend, frustrated, approached one of the waitresses who ignored him.  All THREE waitresses and the bartender knew we were waiting to be seated, knew we waited quite some time, and yet, failed to acknowledge us.  

Definitely will not be coming back to this location and will recommend people to stay away and instead go to the Bloor st. location.  

We left frustrated.  What was supposed to be a very fun evening (at the AGO) ended on a very bitter note.  

Thanks for nothing El Furniture Warehouse Queen St.!"}
{"text":"Omg best value restaurant nearby! They have these crazy $4.95 menu for all day! OMG!!!!!  The fish taco( hard shells) was amazing and I love how they cook the white fish! Spaghetti was also less than 5 bucks cannot believe that right?"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of coming here on a Saturday night - very good vibe, great service and reasonable prices... place was quite busy - definitely one of the new hotspots in the area. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The greatest thing about this place is every single thing on the menu is $5. 
The set up is very cool, tvs everywhere, dj in the back, large bar area. Depending on when you go there could be a very long line to get in. 
The menu has a wide selection of items. Your best bet is to go with a sandwich or a burger, you get the most food for $5 with those options. But since everything is only $5 you could also get a couple of meals. The portions, depending on what you get, can be a bit small. 
The food is pretty good!  I've been here a few times and always order something different. I've always been satisfied with the food. 
Overall, this place is a great stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here at night usually to grab a quick bite.  We have also been here around 6 for dinner.  It gets busy with the after work crowd/hipster students. 

The menu has a decent selection and everything is $5.  There are selections for Vegetarians,  but I am not sure if there are Vegan friendly meals. On occasion they leave somethings out of a meal (ex. chicken and avocado from the Union street Noodle Salad) and we will send it back and they fix it. 

Service can also be hit or miss depending on who your waitress is.  Ask for a pitcher of water at the beginning of your meal so you won't be chasing the waitstaff for a refill. 

Depending on the night it can be busy (Thursday - Saturday) and sometimes there's a line outside the doors.  We prefer to sit on the patio if there's room so we can hear each other talk.  The inside is loud and the TV screens are playing music videos. 

You can buy a beer for the chef or a meal for the less fortunate which is cool too."}
{"text":"Mushroom swiss burger ($4.95) with yam fries (+$1.95) were delicious and cheap.

Would recommend since their food is really good and also really cheap.

Try to avoid dinner primetime as it gets really packed around then."}
{"text":"Very good pub with cheap food! On Wednesday some items were 5 dollars only, like hamburgers, etc..!! The music is too loud though, but anyways the food is good!"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday evening in order to grab dinner with a friend who was visiting from Ottawa. We arrived at 9:30, and we were waiting until 10:45 to enter the establishment. Once we got to the front of the line, the bouncer said that would we would be waiting a \"while\", whilst letting to multiple individuals who seemed to know him into the establishment. It appeared that it was a private party that was going on, yet the owner was inconsiderate enough to let us know and the dozens of other people who waited outside.  From that experience, I intend to never come here again and regret spending that much time outside. In short, not worth, it extremely inconsiderate owners and I, personally, will never be coming here again. Go elsewhere if you wish to have a good time."}
{"text":"The food is pretty damn good for $5 + tax. The drinks are not too bad either, depending on what you get. The only problem I had was with the seating and the lack of space. We came with a group of 10 people and we had to sit on a very uncomfortable table with random holes in it (for style?). Our service was quite decent, but like others have stated the warehouse is very loud and its difficult to speak to each other. Fantastic music though... I mean they played Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G!  

I would come back, but its hard to get a seat. Its packed, and we had to line up briefly at 5PM. Definitely recommend the Queen St Warehouse."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life?  I've been in Toronto for a long time and just found out about this gem now.

Not only is the food cheap but it's tasty! I ended up getting 2 meals because it was so cheap.  (Don't judge me). Everything meal on the menu is $4.95

They do have small upgrades here and there but in the end it will still cost you less than $10 a meal.  I mean where else can you get food that cheap and good in down town Toronto?????  

My new favorite restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Great patio space so I would give it a 3.5 stars just for that. 

Food is mediocre, especially the burgers but it is $5. The best thing here so far is the quinoa salad! Great portion and very unique taste. 

The drinks are $6.50 BUT they are very small - be aware! 

All in all, would come back just for the patio. Not a foodie place though."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

I came here with a friend (and will definitely be coming back with more) on a really nice Friday evening. Although there was a line, it was fairly short (under 15 minutes) and we go seated super quickly on the patio. I loved the atmosphere outside, and although it was louder indoors, I think it'd be great for a night with a group of friends. Decor was super cute (loved the string lights), and they had overall great service. I liked that the servers did not have set uniforms and were allowed to dress in their own unique way (got some outfit inspo!). 

All food was $5, so my friend and i split sweet potato fries and the tiny donuts for dessert. I got the tacos for dinner and she got a pasta bowl. Although serving sizes aren't massive (the tacos were kind of small), I was definitely filled enough and got my money's worth. The food was delicious! The drinks were more expensive, but definitely cheaper than an average cocktail you would get any other place. We tried a bunch of different cocktails from the menu, and all were good! 

I think this place is especially a gem if you're a broke student like me, or even just want a night out with friends. Beware though, because you will definitely be tempted to order multiple items which can add up!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Toronto. I have had a few overnights here in my travels and have explored the city thoroughly, I guess not thoroughly enough. I stumbled across this place via Yelp while staying at the downtown Sheraton. Hands down the best food and drinks money can buy. Aaron and Ryan were awesome bartenders and I have to give them a shout out for their specialty drinks that were not on the menu. Aaron hooked me up with what he called a \"broken bell\" which tasted like a good old fashion orangina. Ryan helped me out with a double jack lemonade which was delicious. 

Now for the food. It was something to die for. The fish tacos here can rival some of the best fish taco joints in San Diego California. Priced at $4.95 you can't go wrong. I also order the classic burger which came with a healthy serving of fries. I can't say much for the burger because a burger is a burger is a burger, but I will reiterate the fish tacos again \" THEY WERE AMAZING!!!\" I'm a 300 pound 6ft 2in man with a crazy appetite and those two plates filled me up. And for $10 CAN you cant go wrong. 

The atmosphere was great. They played 90s and early 00s music from MTV. Never was it not busy. This place had a line to enter from 8pm and still had a line out the door when I left at 10pm. I will recommend this place to anyone that comes to Toronto. The name might say dive bar, but it feels like a local hang out where everyone comes to mingle without that dive bar puke smell. I rate this place 5 stars because of price, atmosphere, excellent staff, great location, cleanliness, and amazing drinks. I will definitely be returning to this place again either for a meal, a drink, or both."}
{"text":"It's a rare sight when I don't see a line outside of Warehouse for lunch or dinner. It's a great atmosphere for carefree drinks with friends. Food can't be beat for the price! Your typical pub food. Tacos were delicious, as were the chicken fingers and fries. My friends had the perogies which they thoroughly enjoyed, and the burgers I heard were great too. Service was quick and the waiter and waitresses were really nice and had great recommendations for drinks. 
If you're looking for a cheap, but good place to eat and catch up with friends over alcohol this is your place! The wait is worth it"}
{"text":"Loud and lively ambience.  Prices are good. 5 dollars a plate. Some better than others.  I found the food to be mediocre.   But cheap enough if you don't like one you can order another.  

It is bar food after all.  I was looking forward to eating the burger but it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.   It definitely wasn't a gourmet burger. That being said. I still think for a downtown bar/restaurant and given the ambience. It's still worth trying at least once.  Waitress was also quite friendly."}
{"text":"Came to Warehouse last night, after hearing good things and who can resist cheap food? After waiting in line for about 30 min or so, we got a seat by the window. I ordered a Double Margarita, the onion rings (with some type of maple bacon drizzle) and the works burger. The burger was good and the bun was really great. The onion rings..they were kinda gross. The drizzle that they put on them didn't really lend well to the onion ring flavour. The other people I was with didn't really seem to like them either. The Margarita I ordered was not that good either, and really didn't seem to have \"double\" the tequila like I had asked. Oh well.

Probably the most annoying thing about this place though was when I was coming out of the washroom and one of the host guys screamed \"boo!\" In my face, causing me to almost slip and fall backwards!

Overall..yeah the food and stuff was cheap. But cheap doesn't always make it good."}
{"text":"Came on a rainy Monday evening and there was no line-ups! I ordered the Quinoa Green Apple Salad. For only $5.95, it was filling, had loads of avocado and quinoa, nice corn salsa on the side, fresh greens...and I would've loved it if it wasn't for the fact that it was dressed with the SALTIEST soy sauce that created a LARGE puddle in the bowl that soaked everything!! After taking the first few bites, I couldn't stomach it and my lips shrivelled from the saltiness! I informed the server and he was a gem for handling it professionally and got me a new salad pronto. The replacement salad no longer had the puddle of soy sauce, but the quinoa was still marinated in the same soy sauce, therefore it was still very salty.

Otherwise, I enjoyed the dessert Mini Donuts which was fluffy warm and the toffee sauce was divine. I also got the Oatmeal Cookie shooter for $5.25 and it was STRONG and I loved the sweet alcoholic flavours. I dug the vibe and throwback music videos playing throughout the night too.

Whoever is reading this from Warehouse, please please remove or dilute the soy sauce dressing on your salads. The salads are so amazing, but the salty soy sauce just makes it so unpleasant."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience ever. I don't care what anyone says, the prices do NOT make up how trash this place is. 

We arrived to a 15 min wait to get in. Could be worse, we've waited hours before. The decor of the place is ok (the ceiling lights) but other than that, everything is filthy. The condiments at the tables outdoor are all dirty and have a layer of dust over them. The tables are filthy and so is the entire place. Don't restaurants have to pass a certain health and safety test? That sounds like a concern here. 

We sat down, our table was sticky. I have to wipe it using some of my water and my napkin that the waitress brought. She then brought the menus, and even the menus feel musty... so gross. Everything is so nasty. 

We were a group of 3, but the waitress only brought 2 waters. Like..... ok.  Then we ordered which was fine, they didn't have the item we all came for, fish tacos. But, it was fine it wasn't her fault I guess, just kinda inconvenient. We all ordered an appetizer and an entree. Food came, no prob.

Now it was time to pay, keep in mind the waitress barely spoke to us the whole time & her service was just whatever, nothing special. If I go to a high class restaurant I ALWAYS tip. But for a cheap 5$ per meal restaurant like this, it's basically a fast food joint, so I wasn't going to, because I don't really believe in tipping anyways. Unless I'm going somewhere upscale.

So each of our totals was like 10 bucks. So I paid first with cash, and she asked me if I wanted my change back & I said yes. So she gave me $3 back, even though my change was supposed to be $3.20, I didn't say anything though, I was like whatever man lol that's pretty shady but whatever. And my friends were paying with debit at the moment so she assumed they were gonna tip (they didn't) so she came up to me and she's like \"Was there something wrong with the service?\" and I was like \"nope\" and she's like \"because you didn't tip.\" and I was like literally like wtf in my head LOL i was like wtaf. So I was like \"ya, I don't believe in tipping.\" and she's like, \"you know if you don't tip your waiter/waitress has to pay 5% of your total at the end of the night\" and I was literally standing there like... ok?? Like what the hell are you even telling me this for, so I said \"so in order to eat here, we HAVE to tip?\" and she was like \"well you don't have to, but it's just what's normal, people tip.\" and I was like \"ok....  well idk what you want to hear, sorry?\" and she's like \"no you don't have to apologize!! Maybe just remember for next time\" and I was like ... \"we're literally broke college students idk\" and she's like \"i understand that but if you don't tip you're basically forcing your waitress to pay for ur meal.\" .... and I just walked away. Like that really sounds like a personal problem. Why'd you take the job. Sorry but I really don't care.

Ok 1) Why do you expect tips on $5 meals. You're literally working at a McDonald's if not dirtier or worse. You're not a bougie restaurant lmao. If you want to be, make everything else match.

2) Why are you confronting customers about not tipping, hella unprofessional, now I for sure won't tip. 

2) Why did you take the job if you aren't down to pay the 5%? You knew the job description before you took the job, that sounds like a personal problem. I understand you have bills but so do I. That's why I choose not to work somewhere like that, and you do. So either quit or shut up and suck it up. Someone else will happily take your position.

3) SHE LITERALLY TOOK THE 20 CENTS. SHE TIPPED HERSELF LMAO. LIKE I COULD'VE ASKED FOR THAT BACK. SHE LITERALLY TIPPED HERSELF WITH MY MONEY LOL. Hella tripping. 

And before anyone asks or thinks I'm scum for why don't I believe in tipping, it's because I feel like if you don't get paid full minimum wage and you have a problem with it, just don't take the job. Like you know what the job description is and if you're not happy with the possibility you won't get a tip, then someone else will happily take the job. And if I get good service, I ALWAYS tip, because there's something worth tipping for. If you're literally dropping my order paper to the kitchen and then dropping my food to me, why am I tipping. You're literally barely doing anything, if anything I should tip the kitchen, that I WOULD believe in doing. I've worked the WORST jobs before, horrible horrible treatment, but hey I had to suck it up because a job is a luxury. Not everyone gets to have one, and anytime I wasn't happy, I just quit. It's easy as that. Everyone's replaceable. I've put in so much work with customers before and I've never got tips. So honestly, F you if you're that entitled. 

P.s. she's the girl who was wearing a plaid dress on Wednesday May 2nd."}
{"text":"The staff is kind, the music is great, all of the food is $5. Sooooo wouldn't that make it a four or five star place? Yes, yes it would... if you are under 25. 

It's loud, the people are oh-so young and it's just quite the varsity scene. It's just a little too much for three ladies looking for some drinks to ease the pain of a long work day. 

I would, however, like to say thank you to the kind doorman who asked to see this 31 year old mother's ID. You're too kind."}
{"text":"Queen St Warehouse... premium dive bar. Such as an oxymoron. But that's just details. I quite enjoy this place in off-peak hours. I like sitting on the patio in the summer either with a few friends or for a quick lunch. As everyone has mentioned, every ything on their food menu is $4.95. Plus its pretty tasty. I am a sucker for their burgers(because they are made with Alberta Beef, which is divine.) 

Service can vary here. Sometimes it's quick and other times I feel forgotten. But no time has ever been notably bad. It does get a little nutty after work hours and for brunch, prepare to wait.

I will keep coming because my wallet loves the cheap eats and I'm a sucker for a patio on Queen West."}
{"text":"I can't help but give this place a 2 star...I've come here so many times because I work across the street but it's so (excuse my language) shit!

Obviously when you're paying 5 bucks for every food item on the menu you're paying what you get for! it's just crazy that some days the wait for the food is so long because it doesn't seem like food that requires that much effort.

The most recent time I went in (and probably the reason I won't go back) 2 different things happened 

First of all- my boyfriend got there before me and ordered a cesar and requested for it not to be too spicy how I like it. Well I got it and it was definitely spicy!! Too spicy in fact. When we tried to send it back (which is pretty fair and I've done it at tons of restaurants who took it back no problem) the server was extremely hesitant but said she'd try and ended up just bringing over a glass of clamato juice and saying to pour some in to even out the taste. CHEAP!!!!!!

Also, my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese and when she asked if he wanted bacon he said yes. Well there was no bacon and that didn't stop him from eating it :P but on the bill there was a charge for bacon! When we explained to the server how there was no bacon but we were charged for it again she was hesitant and told us to just take that dollar off her tip.

I'm not blaming the server by any means. I don't know who runs that place but it sucks!

The food is pretty decent though and it's usually quick and a good go to if you're feeling poor or indecisive. 

NEVER GET THE CARROT GINGER SOUP!!!! It tastes like shit.

Also they don't take debit!

That is all :)"}
{"text":"I can't stand this place. Their cheap fare doesn't make up for the atrocious service. 
I've only ever had the \"works\" burger and to be honest, I don't have any complaints about it. Comes with bacon and fake cheese so it kind of has that satisfying junk food quality to it that pairs well with a beer. You probably won't be disappointed with the food, is what I'm saying. However, the service fucking sucks. First time I came here was for drinks - we were told it would be a fifteen minute wait. Forty five minutes later, we're seated finally at a table (with a fucking hole in the middle. Some kind of repurposed plank of wood with actual gouges in it that go clear through the table. I narrowly avoid dropping my beer through the hole multiple times throughout the night). I digress, after our drinks we order a bill each and the server gives three out of five of my friends the wrong bill. After they point it out, she gets all flustered and angry and starts fiddling with the receipt machine and it breaks, apparently. She says she can't remember what we ordered and my friends proceed to tell her what they ordered and what the price was. She ignores them and goes, well .... let's just say it was $15. Most of them had only ordered a single beer, so they were like .. no? By that point though, we just wanted to leave so they paid the \"bill\" and we left. Next visit was in the summer and the place was nearly empty inside, we request a patio seat and the server goes \"I'll check if there are tables available\" and leaves. Ten minutes go by and we're still waiting at the front, a couple comes in behind us and a male server seats them, ignoring us. Then he comes back and asks if we've been taken care of. We're like ... uhh yeah, I think so. We're waiting on a patio seat. He just nods and goes to take care of his tables. Then another five minutes go by and we flag him down and tell him our hostess never returned and we'd like to be seated. He seats us on the patio next to a giant pipe sticking out of the wall. It's flush to our table and MY seat, so I'm forced to accommodate this awkward fucking pipe that's pressing into my arm. Rest of the meal was uneventful but I haven't returned. I have heard some awful stories about the behaviour of the bartenders, hitting on girls at the bar during their shift and giving them \"extra special attention\" while ignoring everyone else. Also heard a story about a bartenders general sliminess towards a middle aged couple and it made me physically sick.
Their chain also employs a transphobic, verbally abusive social media team. Seeing this restaurant headline in a Buzzfeed article for posting a transphobic instagram image and responding to backlash like 5-year-olds was the last straw.
My final verdict: garbage trash establishment. You couldn't pay me to step foot in here again."}
{"text":"Not a regular blogger or reviewer however, for this bar I'll make an exception. 
Came here in high hopes after being a regular at the sister bar on bloor st, a great spot with exceptional service from every member of staff and an amazing vibe. 
It began like el furny, we were sat by a nice guy, music was good, atmosphere buzzing, and then we met our server. The service we from our her was the worst I have ever had the displeasure to experience in any bar or restaurant in Toronto. This just spoilt the night, she was just not a nice person from ordering our first round, (came over and said 'menus'?! Pardon? Do. You. Need. menus!. No thanks just drinks tonight. \"Wear drinks?\") to telling (not asking) us to leave the table so her friends could sit together. When we said we would prefer to sit at the bar she advised us to find a seat. We looked and nothing was available.. Busy Wednesday.. So instead we said we'd finish our drinks and leave. She started arguing, yes arguing and told us, move, I have a table wanting to sit here.. Yup, we were still sat. We had no problem moving for her friends, however the manner In which it was done was crass and terrible service. She was not friendly or accommodating. We are two dudes on a night out after finishing work at our bar, looking for a pint. Not a couple on a date wanting to be sat in the restaurant section. 
She was rude and this resulted in us leaving without any intention to return. Real shame and queen st need to sort out this clear error in recruitment. Maybe she should be put in training at the bloor st location or just learn manners."}
