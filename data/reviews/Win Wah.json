{"text":"Wow ! Saw lots of negative reviews about this place . Sorry but , just ordered meals for five people and must tell you , Fantastic ! Plenty for all and some leftovers ."}
{"text":"Wow called for delivery and the said they aren't going to st lazare wow that's the first time I ever heard something like that horrible"}
{"text":"It was the worst buffet I ever had. My husband and a friend had hot and sour soup and immediately they put it away after tasting cigarette ashes in the soup. I am not a picky eater. There are so limited choices that I find it hard to find much edible for me. This is the first time I found a restaurant dare to serve deep-fried day-old sushi.The empty food trays left too long to be filled.The old lady who replenish ed the food trays was rough and rude, yelling at customers. When asked for management, one of the staff said neither the manager nor the supervisor was there. It was later found that the supervisor was actually there when other younger staff were asked. I did not have the chance to talk to the management because of time constraints. Patrons be aware! No stars if possible."}
{"text":"I'm a little appalled by the price of the buffet for the quantity and quality of the food this place offers. People usually come to buffets for cheap, greasy food, but 25 dollars per person is a little absurd. Service was attentive, and the staff seemed very sweet and happy."}
{"text":"The noodles were the only thing I thought were decent. Everything overall was greasy. I was hoping the soups would salvage the meal, but it was disappointing also. The hot and sour lacked flavor, dumpling was doughy, and congee tasted like soggy rice with salt."}
{"text":"Great selection of food that for the most part was pretty tasty.  The restaurant was very clean which is nice.  The staff was responsive and cheerful even though it was very busy during the lunch rush.    My complaint - the general tao chicken wasn't good.   It was mostly breading and not a lot of chicken.  Also, the desert table was nothing to write home about.  However for the price, I recommend going."}
{"text":"Wow. I've never been to a buffet where the selection was so.... limited.  The food seemed ok to look at, didn't have much taste, so I wasn't really sure whether I was really eating what they were advertising..."}
{"text":"Voici un resto chinois comme le Québec en aligne des centaines, voir des milliers. Win Wah vous offre ni plus ni moins que les grands classiques de la cuisine chinoise revus aux gouts des québécois dans une formule \" buffet à volonté \". On y trouve donc, des spear-ribs dans une sauce visqueuse à l'ail, du poulet du générale Tao trop enrobé de panure, des légumes plutôt délicieux ou encore du riz frit légèrement croustillant, sans oublier l'éternelle soupe Wong-Tong  Les classiques quoi... rien de nouveau ici. Ne vous attendez pas à faire des découvertes. Les prix sont très abordables. La salle à manger a cependant besoin d'un peu de rénovation.   Comme dans bien des restos de ce genre, le puriste à la recherche d'une véritable expérience culinaire cantonaise sera déçu. Quant à lui, l'estomac vide à la recherche d'une bonne bouffe sera heureux ici, car Win Wah vous prépare des mets savoureux, en quantité généreuse, à défaut d'être inventifs. On vient donc ici lorsqu'on a vraiment faim et qu'on est prêt à mettre ses attentes de foodies de côté."}
