{"text":"This is always my favorite sub place.  It's a great alternative to subway or quzinos.  More of a home made/ small town joint feeling.   My favorites: Chicken salad (yay oil and vinegar) and the hot Sicilian (finally a sub named after me).  The Sicilian reminds me of a Mr Hero, but doesn't make you feel like complete crap afterward."}
{"text":"\"Why havent I ate here before\" was the first thing I said when I started eating my sub! Holy good lord....great!  So this place is very small, when i went in on my lunch there was one guy there, I want to assume he is the owner, sooo very nice!  I ordered the italian sub minus tomatoes and onions added on bananna peppers. He heated it up for me a bit, I also ordered a bag of chips..............so a 6\" and bag of chips was $5.14.................sorry subway but Sub Sations is my new place!  They put this italian oil/vinegar dressing on it which is just delicious.  I will definetly be visiting Sub Sations more often! yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite sandwich places.  The ingredients are so fresh - bread, meat, cheese.  You can tell they prepare/slice their own meats and salads.  The Italian Pepperoni with Pepper Relish is the best sandwich - yuuummmmmy!!  A whole lot better than Subway.  Highly recommended - you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Better than any chain sub shop. You gotta love the ham and provolone sub. Love this place the best. Wish it was open every saturday but no worries love it no matter what."}
